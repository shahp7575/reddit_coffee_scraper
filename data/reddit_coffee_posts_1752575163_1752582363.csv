I am looking for book recommendations on epidemiology/diseases to gift a friend. He is really fascinated by the subject but doesn't come from a science background. But he works as a health journalist, so he interacts with the subject fairly often, so I wanted to give him something really cool around it.

I would love if there's a coffee table-type or encyclopedia kind of book on it, but I havent been able to find anything like it that's not too academic or for children. Non fiction would also do, and I know there are a lot of non fiction narrative books, but something hardcover with visuals would be even better. Any recommendations would be really helpful.

You're chatting with a rather nice torso. Then they reveal the dace and it doesn't live up to the body. And then there's that subtle disappointment they face. And normally it's not in a good way. And sometimes, these guys are playing hard to get. And it's kind of like, this is what's making me jump through hoops? I was talking to this guy over the weekend. Great body. His bio seems like he's a fun guy. But his messages are all really short. At first, I thought he wasn't interested, but I notice he responds pretty quickly. And he seems to be engaged in the conversation, just giving 1 worded responses. He's liking my messages too. Which is also kinda odd. But it did kinda feel like I was carrying the conversation. Asking how his day was, etc. But I offered to trade pics and he said sure. He liked my pics, but he sends his pics over. And, his face was not what I thought it would be. He just looked, rough. 

  
And for a moment I was like ""this is who is playing hard to get?"" And I'll be honest, my attraction to him did fade. I was trying to meet him for a coffee date too before this. It kinda seemed like pulling teeth, but he would still respond. But now? Seeing the face combined with me carrying the conversation? No sir. I want to give him a chance though. Like, we would be compatible sexually, he's actually single, he's in shape, we're near the same age. Maybe he's just not a good conversationalist? His profile does say ""DL"" so maybe that's a huge part of it. 

  
I've also experienced this myself. Guys have told me my face doesn't match up with my body. I have a ""jocks body"" but they say I have a babyface. Alot of people mistake me for looking 21 even though I'm turning 27 soon. Or that I'm ""handsome"" or ""gorgeous"" or ""model type pretty"". I do model and am signed with an agency so I guess it makes sense. I showed a guy my face pic and he said I was ""too pretty to be a top"". I've also had guys tell me I look too young for them. One guy looked at my facepic and said ""Chris Hansen is gonna pop up behind you isn't he?"". So, I have experienced this, but on the opposite end. Anyone else experienced this?

His profile had tons of quirky details, but the line that caught my eye was 'World Champion Sneeze Counter.' I mean, how do you not swipe right for that level of curiosity? üòÇ

Anyway, over coffee, I just had to ask him more about this ""competitive sneeze counting."" Apparently, it‚Äôs this obscure hobby where people quite literally count sneezes competitively. ü§î I tried soooo hard not to laugh too much when he started explaining the rules. Supposedly, it‚Äôs all about timing and rapid math skills. What even, right? üëÄ

I gotta admit, his passion for it was kinda adorable. We spent a good part of the date with him mimicking tiny sneeze movements (which he swore made him better at it) and me attempting not to burst out into full-on giggles. It was like a strange mix of fascination and total incredulity.

I left the date with my cheeks hurting from laughing and a story to definitely tell at parties.

1m0gbyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m0gbyx/i_sent_him_back_his_selfies/,I sent him back his selfies,"I literally almost never get attracted to anyone. It's super hard for me to find a person attractive. Physical beauty on its own is not enough for me and it happens to me maybe once every 2 years or less, to see and like a man and have any attraction to him. No matter how handsome/beautiful those men are.

So here I am, back on facebook, after many months of not using it at all, I went in to post a little reel, that had some nice moments and myself in them.. And this guy, that I completely forgot about, the one that is clearly divinely created, cause can I just say PERFECTION .. He reacts with 5 hearts on my story. He's literally gorgeous, like a 100/10. Face, body, but the eyes... I've always loved to look into his beautiful deep eyes....  
And he's not just handsome, but quite intelligent and loves the same type of music and is bold and masculine, and loves God and has all of these bombastic fantastic traits, that combined, just make him extremely attractive to me. And super rare. For me. And I'm pretty sure for other women too, but that's not my business.  
We've chatted before, here and there, he's liked my pictures and videos before, but never overtly tried to flirt with me. Maybe slightly covertly, like 2y ago, but that's it. So after his 5 hearts, I decided to shoot him a message, to see how he's doing, where he's at, in life, you know. We've done that before so I didn't see why not. Thought it'd be a 3 line exchange and I'll go back to forgetting how handsome he is.

But this time was different, right from the get go he calls me a doll and beautiful and starts flirting with me, I'm obviously excited about it, and we have an amazing chemistry in conversation too, the humour the intelligent flirting, the lack of need to explain, cause he gets me, without even trying ah!  
It was GREAT until his flirting jokes started getting a little too .. close to sexual, and I tried to put a boundary, soft at first, then very very clear, and we kept going from flirting to benign topics, yet somehow we always came back to sexy jokes. Until I left the conversation to go grab a link of something funny to share with him, and when I came back, I came back to a selfie he sent me.. of him, shirtless, half sitting, half laying in bed. With a serious expression too! I was like ""SIR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" LOL  
It was just a selfie of his face, shoulders and up, but you know, the vibe, is too soon, too sexy, too much.

So I expressed that, and told him I'm glad at least his photo was cropped. Next thing I know I have a picture of him shirtless with his full six pack smiling at me doing that biceps pose with his arm, that male models do LOL . It was shocking, but also perfect looking but also very tempting in nature, but also WHY. Like he's exactly 1000% what I LIKE. But not in our first real long conversation!!!  
It was so hard to put that boundary, especially with his soft voice, it felt like a pro seducer move from his side haha but that was way too much too early, too ...tooo tooo!  
At this point I told him I'm going to sleep and thanks for the funny and flirty conversation and sent him a funny link to checkout and we finished the 2h talk.  
For the record I didn't overstep my boundaries and nothing sexual was spoken of. I just enjoyed the beauty and his sexy voice. The rest was jokes and flirting.

I didn't expect this from someone who .. all he does is speak about God, in his life, he is sort of a public (small) figure, and all he speaks about is spirit, Jesus, God, bible etc... given the fact that one night stands type of behavior is not exactly Jesus friendly, but I'm not judging. I had fun flirting with him, but I stood my ground and didn't step on any of my boundaries. Also I'm not a 1 night stand type of a woman, so I wouldn't entertain that either way. A little flirting though, was pretty exciting, with him.

The next day came and honestly I didn't even know if I'll ever hear from him again, but I did.  
He did message me some things back and forth and this time no excessive flirting, he only said that if we were close, we'd be meeting face to face for coffee, and not just have these conversations on the phone  
( coffee??!?!? that's not a date) and then enjoyed some deep spiritual topics, and I was happy about that.  
Then out of nowhere, mid voice-messages conversation, he disappeared. Stopped responding. I haven't said anything stupid, we were literally exchanging deep topics and some knowledge, then BAM... At first he didn't even open the voice messages I'd sent in response to his. The next day he'd opened them and left me on seen.  
The only thing that I can think of that I might have said is offering some knowledge about a third language that I know (and he doesn't) to talk about the symbolism of a word that he expressed wrongly, but being told more about what you know or even being corrected in something you said wrong by a native speaker, is NOT a reason to ghost someone... At least not in my book. Maybe in his ego - book though. It's not like I was rude about it or even tried to correct him, just expressed what I know, in addition to what he said. So I genuinely don't think I've said anything wrong.

He's online. ALL THE TIME. He's seen my reply and has left me on seen for days now.  
I know that once we (ladies) hit the 24h it's over, so even though I decided to walk away.. I had this crazy urge, that probably no one will understand, but I had to do it for myself.  
To send him back his selfies before I walk away.  
His shirtless, perfect looking sexy selfies, that I didn't ask for.  
Send them back.  
Petty? Maybe. But not to me.  
Return them, like an unwanted, yet perfect gift,  
return that which does not belong to me, to its rightful owner. Not for attention. Not for a reply. Not for a question to answer. Just to set the record straight, for my future.  
Like an ethereal, maybe, energetic return, that was brought into my mind, my memory and has tempted me, to send it back, and disown it.  
To place it back, where it belongs.

I've never returned gifts before in my adult life.

It's not like he sent them for the right reasons anyway.  
He obviously just sees me as a piece of meat, with no feelings and opinions that matter to him. Clearly just wanted to cross my boundaries (yes in a sexy way, but) for his own sexual gratification, without even seeing me as a human being. And that made me feel disrespected.

So I did it. And I feel relieved!  
And I don't give a shit what he's gonna think of me anyway. Clearly he has no empathy for me, so it doesn't matter how ""crazy"" of a woman he thinks I am.

After I did it, I went back on tiktok, to unfollow him, and what do I see...  
He's shot this one video (martial arts), completely out of the ordinary (spiritual talks), just now, while ignoring me, when... we were talking about martial arts the other day, and I complemented his speed and technique and I said how much I miss kickboxing. He's not posted martial arts on his tiktok like ever or maybe at least in years. Feels like he's begging for attention and validation, while ignoring me at the same time...?  
How pathetic!  
He's even wearing one of those free the nips male ""tops"" when the other night after he sent me that freed nips photo we joked about it. He never dresses like this on this videos. It doesn't even look like a top, it just looks like a piece of fabric flying around unattended lol  
This is just... so strange!

I'm pretty sure we'll never talk again, and he'll never know why I did what I did.  
And it's fine..ish.",1,1752582103.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1m0gbdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFinanceTrending/comments/1m0gbdq/still_using_rsi_and_macd_in_2025_am_i_a_dinosaur/,Still Using RSI and MACD in 2025 ‚Äì Am I a Dinosaur or Just Disciplined?,"https://preview.redd.it/e07lg73961df1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7f9fad650253ce71acf7d6960cbb916a7045885

# The Enduring Popularity of RSI and MACD in 2025

It‚Äôs 2025, and I‚Äôm still using RSI and MACD like it‚Äôs 2013. Sometimes I wonder if that makes me outdated-like the guy still clinging to wired headphones while everyone else has Neuralink-powered scalp music. But every time I try switching to newer, shinier indicators, I end up right back here. Just me, my charts, and two little tools that somehow still feel like home.

The truth is, RSI and MACD have a staying power most indicators can‚Äôt touch. Even now, in a world flooded with predictive models, AI-generated sentiment signals, and enough algorithmic strategies to crash your CPU, these two tools remain the go-to combo for thousands of traders-whether they‚Äôre scalping crypto or swing trading ETFs on their lunch break.

It‚Äôs easy to look at RSI and MACD and think, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way these dinosaurs still work.‚Äù But when you step back and actually use them-not blindly, but as part of a disciplined setup-they still deliver. Not perfectly. Not magically. But consistently enough to make you stop and ask: what if it‚Äôs not about keeping up with the newest thing, but about sticking with what actually keeps you sane?

**Why Are RSI and MACD Still Relevant in 2025?**

The thing about RSI and MACD is they‚Äôre not trying to be anything they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre not promising to predict the next breakout before it happens. They‚Äôre not whispering secret signals pulled from sentiment analysis or data scraping. They‚Äôre just showing you the mood of the market in real time-and asking you to respond, not react.

RSI, the Relative Strength Index, is still a favorite because it does one job well. It tells you when something might be overbought or oversold. It doesn‚Äôt give you drama. Just vibes backed by math.

MACD, or Moving Average Convergence Divergence, leans a bit deeper. It doesn‚Äôt scream for attention, but when a crossover happens or divergence pops up, it‚Äôs like a quiet nudge saying, ‚ÄúHey, the momentum is shifting. You seeing this?‚Äù

What makes them relevant even now isn‚Äôt just nostalgia. It‚Äôs accessibility. Anyone with a TradingView account or a half-decent brokerage platform can use them. You don‚Äôt need to be a quant or code in Python to make them work. That matters in a world where overcomplication has become the default.

**Are RSI and MACD Still Effective for Traders in Modern Markets?**

Let‚Äôs not romanticize it. RSI and MACD won‚Äôt save you in a flash crash. They won‚Äôt call the top of a parabolic rally. And if you‚Äôre relying on them without understanding how they behave in different market conditions, you‚Äôll get wrecked.

But if you‚Äôre using them as part of a structured approach-one that‚Äôs backtested, adjusted for your timeframe, and grounded in rules-they can be wildly effective. Not because they predict the future, but because they help you avoid stupid trades.

Effectiveness in trading isn‚Äôt about being right all the time. It‚Äôs about having a system that you can follow even when your brain is screaming to panic-buy or rage-sell. RSI and MACD give structure. They slow you down just enough to second-guess the impulsive stuff. In a market ruled by noise and FOMO, that‚Äôs a serious edge.

**The Enduring Power of RSI and MACD: A Deep Dive into Their Continued Utility in 2025**

Here‚Äôs the part nobody really talks about: even the most advanced algorithmic systems today are built on the skeletons of indicators like RSI and MACD. They might be dressed up with machine learning or run through a thousand layers of neural net wizardry, but the core logic-momentum, trend, exhaustion-it‚Äôs the same.

I spoke with a quant analyst last year who builds custom tools for institutional desks, and he straight-up told me: ‚ÄúYeah, we use RSI concepts. We just layer them with volume-weighted filters and sentiment overlays.‚Äù In other words, the tools have evolved, but the foundation hasn‚Äôt disappeared.

There‚Äôs a kind of elegance in how RSI and MACD strip everything down. They let you see the rhythm of the market without distraction. And when you actually commit to them-not as one-click solutions, but as part of a broader system-they don‚Äôt just work. They teach you how to wait, how to listen, and how to act with intention.

I spent the first half of 2023 chasing complexity. I tried sentiment dashboards, AI-generated alerts, even a machine learning script someone sold me on Discord. And it worked... until it didn‚Äôt. The worst part wasn‚Äôt the losses. It was the way I felt-disconnected from my own trades. Like I was just reacting to noise I didn‚Äôt even understand.

Coming back to RSI and MACD felt like putting my feet back on the ground. The signals were familiar, but more than that, they were mine. I knew what they meant. I knew how I reacted to them. And I wasn‚Äôt second-guessing every move because I wasn‚Äôt outsourcing my judgment to some algorithm I couldn‚Äôt explain.

**Insight from ‚ÄúAtomic Habits‚Äù by James Clear ‚Äì Chapter 16**

‚ÄúYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.‚Äù

That line hit me like a brick. Because that‚Äôs exactly what RSI and MACD are for me. They‚Äôre not flashy. They don‚Äôt win Twitter threads. But they form a system I can fall back on when everything else gets noisy. And in a market that never shuts up, that kind of discipline might be the biggest edge we have left.

# How Trading Indicators Have Evolved Since RSI and MACD

The trading world didn‚Äôt just evolve-it sprinted into chaos. Since the days when RSI and MACD ruled the charts, we‚Äôve seen an explosion of new tools, flashy signals, and algorithmic models that promise to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù before you‚Äôve even had coffee. Some of them are brilliant. Some are straight-up marketing noise. But all of them exist because the market doesn‚Äôt sit still-and neither do we.

Still, not everything that‚Äôs advanced is actually better. And not everything that‚Äôs older is obsolete.

So where does that leave us?

**Are Newer Indicators Better Than RSI and MACD in 2025?**

Here‚Äôs the messy truth: a lot of newer indicators look better on paper, especially if you‚Äôre just watching backtests or YouTube breakdowns with perfect setups and zero emotion. You‚Äôll hear terms like ""reinforcement learning,"" ""signal clustering,"" or ""high-dimensional volatility models"" and feel like you‚Äôve been trading in the Stone Age.

But better doesn‚Äôt mean more usable. And in the real world, where your attention span is split between a job, life, and a volatile market that turns on a tweet, simpler tools often win.

The newer indicators can offer tighter signals, more reactivity, or predictive value-but they also come with more complexity, steeper learning curves, and higher chances of misuse if you‚Äôre not careful. You‚Äôre not just reading an indicator; you‚Äôre trying to trust a system you didn‚Äôt build, can‚Äôt easily explain, and maybe don‚Äôt fully understand.

In that way, RSI and MACD still win. Not because they‚Äôre newer. But because they‚Äôre clear. Because you know exactly what they‚Äôre doing-and that gives you power over how you respond.

**What Are the Most Advanced Alternatives to RSI and MACD Today?**

In 2025, the frontier of trading indicators looks like something out of a sci-fi film. You‚Äôve got sentiment-weighted volume heatmaps, predictive neural indicators, and tools that scrape social media and news headlines in real-time to assess ‚Äúmarket mood.‚Äù You‚Äôve got platforms that track thousands of data points and feed them into adaptive machine learning systems that attempt to front-run patterns.

There‚Äôs also a new wave of indicators built entirely by AI, some of which recalibrate themselves daily based on evolving market inputs. These aren‚Äôt just giving buy or sell signals-they‚Äôre trying to think like the market before it acts.

For advanced traders, these tools are gold. They offer layers of nuance and multi-factor data streams that would‚Äôve been impossible just a few years ago. But they also come at a cost-mentally, financially, and emotionally. The more complex your tools, the more energy it takes to maintain conviction when they go wrong. Because they will go wrong. Every system does.

**Why Do Many Traders Still Swear by Traditional Indicators Despite Advancements?**

Because trading is 80% mental. You can give someone the best system in the world, and if they don‚Äôt believe in it, they‚Äôll abandon it after three losing trades. What RSI and MACD offer that most advanced tools don‚Äôt is trust. A sense of rhythm. Years of emotional memory and pattern recognition that can‚Äôt be quantified.

Most traders don‚Äôt just use indicators for signals-they use them for structure. For stability. For a way to quiet the noise when the market is screaming at them to panic.

There‚Äôs something powerful about using a tool you‚Äôve seen work through three different market cycles. That kind of experience builds conviction. And conviction is what lets you stay in a trade when your gut is telling you to bail.

Last year, I beta-tested a smart indicator suite that pulled real-time Reddit sentiment, crypto inflows, and options flow into one predictive dashboard. It was wild-accurate, data-rich, and beautiful. But after two months, I was exhausted. I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was trading the chart or just reacting to the dashboard‚Äôs mood swings.

I went back to RSI and MACD not because they‚Äôre smarter, but because they give me space to think. To breathe. To decide. That matters more than any predictive edge you can buy.

**Insight from ‚ÄúThe Psychology of Money‚Äù by Morgan Housel ‚Äì Chapter 13**

‚ÄúControlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.‚Äù

Most of these newer tools promise control over the market. But what a lot of experienced traders realize is that the real win isn‚Äôt perfect entries-it‚Äôs peace of mind. RSI and MACD don‚Äôt just simplify your trading setup. They give you back time, energy, and mental bandwidth. And in the chaos of modern markets, that might be the highest ROI there is.

# The Pros and Cons of RSI and MACD in Modern Trading

No indicator is bulletproof. Not even the old reliables.

In 2025, with markets reacting to everything from AI-fed trading bots to TikTok-fueled pump cycles, the tools you choose say a lot about how you trade-and how you handle chaos. RSI and MACD have been around for decades, and while their simplicity is often praised, it‚Äôs also what gets them dragged in forums and finfluencer rants.

Some call them outdated. Others call them timeless.

The truth, as usual, is somewhere in the uncomfortable middle.

**What Are the Limitations of RSI and MACD in Volatile Markets?**

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable part first: RSI and MACD were built in an era when markets moved slower, were less algorithm-driven, and had far fewer fakeouts.

In today‚Äôs world, price action doesn‚Äôt just reflect fundamentals or investor sentiment-it reflects algos fighting algos, front-running volume, and whales playing retail traders like a game of chess.

In that environment, RSI and MACD can lag. They can throw false signals when a spike is nothing more than short-covering. They can tell you something is oversold, right before it dumps another 10%.

If you‚Äôre not adjusting your settings or cross-checking with other indicators, they can get noisy. Worse, they can feel ‚Äúwrong‚Äù just when you need clarity most.

But here‚Äôs what‚Äôs real: the tools aren‚Äôt broken. The context has changed. And in volatile markets, that means they require more discretion, not blind faith.

**Can RSI and MACD Be Used Effectively in Automated or AI-Based Trading?**

Yes-and they already are. The twist is that they‚Äôre usually part of something bigger.

Most modern algo strategies still incorporate RSI and MACD logic at their core. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre dressed up with layers of filtering, confirmation, and context. You‚Äôll find them triggering trades, filtering out noise, or acting as throttles for more complex systems.

So if you‚Äôre thinking about coding your own bot or using these indicators in a rule-based strategy, the answer is: yes, they still belong. They‚Äôre programmable, explainable, and stable across most platforms. Which makes them incredibly useful for automation-especially if you‚Äôre building your system from scratch or trying to keep it transparent.

What doesn‚Äôt work? Treating them like crystal balls.

If you expect your RSI-based bot to print cash in all conditions without supervision or context, you‚Äôre not trading-you‚Äôre gambling on autopilot.

**How Do RSI and MACD Compare to Newer Machine-Learning-Based Tools?**

It‚Äôs not a fair fight, honestly.

Machine learning tools don‚Äôt just look at price and volume-they analyze everything from macroeconomic news to global fund flows to tweet sentiment from high-influence accounts. They‚Äôre designed to spot patterns humans can‚Äôt see and react faster than you can blink.

But that doesn‚Äôt make them better for everyone.

ML tools are expensive, require ongoing training and updates, and can become black boxes-you don‚Äôt always know why a signal was generated. That might be fine for a hedge fund with a team of data scientists. For the solo trader or side hustler building a strategy in between classes or after work, it‚Äôs a lot to manage.

What RSI and MACD offer is *interpretability*. You can look at a chart, see a divergence, and understand why. You don‚Äôt have to trust it blindly. You can question it, test it, and decide.

And in an age where we‚Äôre outsourcing more and more decisions to machines, that kind of transparency might be the rarest edge of all.

Back when I was experimenting with a plug-and-play AI trading system, I remember how frustrating it was not knowing *why* a trade was entered. It was like living with a roommate who moves your stuff and refuses to explain themselves.

I missed the clarity of RSI and MACD. I missed being able to say, ‚ÄúOkay, I see what this setup is telling me, and I know what I‚Äôll do if it plays out-or if it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù

That clarity made me feel like a trader again. Not a button pusher.

**Insight from ‚ÄúThinking, Fast and Slow‚Äù by Daniel Kahneman ‚Äì Chapter 20**

‚ÄúThe more successful the defensive operations of System 2, the more it weakens the impulsive actions of System 1.‚Äù

RSI and MACD aren‚Äôt perfect. But they‚Äôre part of a thinking system. A method. And in the high-speed, emotionally loaded world of trading, that‚Äôs what saves you-not hype, not predictions, but steady tools that slow you down just enough to think.

# Understanding the Discipline Behind Using RSI and MACD in 2025

At this point, we‚Äôve covered the tools, the tech, and the trends. But the real question-especially as a Gen Z trader staring down the endless options of new indicators and fancy automated systems-is this: why stick with RSI and MACD when everything else feels so much more‚Ä¶ advanced?

The answer? Discipline. And it‚Äôs the kind of discipline that comes from knowing your system works-because you‚Äôve seen it work, over and over again.

**Is Sticking to Traditional Indicators a Sign of Discipline or Stagnation?**

I get it. In a world obsessed with the latest and greatest, sticking to the classics can feel like a confession of laziness, even resistance to progress. After all, why would you use a 40-year-old tool when AI is picking stocks for people in real-time?

Here‚Äôs the truth: it‚Äôs easy to get distracted by new shiny things. But sticking to a system-whether that‚Äôs RSI, MACD, or whatever works for you-isn‚Äôt stagnation. It‚Äôs an active choice to trust what you know.

When you lean into these indicators, you‚Äôre not being stubborn. You‚Äôre being consistent. You‚Äôre relying on time-tested tools to form a foundation for your trading decisions. The world moves fast. Tech moves faster. But your ability to follow through with a clear strategy? That‚Äôs what matters in the long run.

Discipline in trading doesn‚Äôt look like complex systems or predictive models. It looks like showing up every day, trusting your setup, and executing your strategy with no emotional shortcuts. In a world that‚Äôs always changing, consistency is your anchor.

**The Psychology of Disciplined Trading: Why RSI and MACD Can Foster Consistency**

Trading is a battle against yourself as much as it is against the market. There are no shortcuts to success; no indicator can fix that for you. And while many newer tools promise faster profits or more accurate signals, the reality is they often feed into our worst impulses. They push us toward trying to outsmart the market-often just when we should be sitting back and letting the market show us what it‚Äôs doing.

RSI and MACD might not be able to predict the next massive move, but they provide structure. They take away the need to constantly make emotional decisions or react impulsively. By using these indicators, you‚Äôre forced into a rhythm-a predictable system that keeps your head cool when the market is throwing tantrums.

That‚Äôs the real value in these tools. They don‚Äôt just give you signals. They give you consistency. And in an unpredictable market, consistency is one of the few things that can help you weather the storm.

**How Does Sticking to Proven Methods Help in Navigating Market Fluctuations?**

When the market crashes, the adrenaline kicks in. When prices skyrocket, we can feel the FOMO creeping up. In those moments, it‚Äôs easy to want to change the plan, chase the trend, or gamble on a big win. But the best traders know that when the market gets wild, it‚Äôs the steady hands that win the race-not the ones reaching for the next tool.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: RSI and MACD don‚Äôt give you that rush. They don‚Äôt promise the next big trade or the most dramatic breakout. But they do give you a simple, clean setup to follow. And that‚Äôs the discipline of trading-the ability to stick to a plan, even when every other voice in your head is telling you to do something else.

Because at the end of the day, success in trading isn‚Äôt about picking the next hot stock or finding the next secret algorithm. It‚Äôs about following the plan you trust, through thick and thin. RSI and MACD are old tools, sure. But they offer something more valuable than the latest tech-they give you the power to *stay grounded*, no matter how chaotic the market gets.

There‚Äôs a quiet satisfaction that comes with sticking to a tried-and-true strategy. In early 2024, I hit a few rough patches. I was tempted to jump into every new tech-based tool that promised the moon. But after I settled back into my RSI and MACD setup, something clicked. The trades weren‚Äôt always perfect. But there was confidence in the process.

No noise. No confusion. Just a steady strategy that I knew how to navigate.

**Insight from ‚ÄúThe Intelligent Investor‚Äù by Benjamin Graham ‚Äì Chapter 1**

‚ÄúThe individual investor should act with a calm and reasoned approach, relying on fundamentals, not speculation.‚Äù

If there‚Äôs a philosophy that has stood the test of time in investing and trading, it‚Äôs this one. RSI and MACD aren‚Äôt about speculation. They‚Äôre about following the fundamentals of market rhythm-taking emotion out of the equation and trading from a place of clarity.

**Final Thoughts: Is RSI and MACD the Future or the Past?**

In 2025, we‚Äôre living in a world of infinite choices-each promising to be smarter, faster, and more accurate than the last. But when the dust settles, there‚Äôs still something deeply reliable about sticking with tools that have worked for decades. RSI and MACD might not offer you some high-tech shortcut. But they give you something else: discipline. Structure. Consistency.

And in a market that‚Äôs more unpredictable than ever, that might be the most powerful tool of all.

  


# FAQ: Still Using RSI and MACD in 2025?

Sometimes the simplest tools raise the biggest questions-especially now, when trading feels faster and more complex than ever. So let‚Äôs break it down clearly: do RSI and MACD still matter? Or have they been left behind?

# Are RSI and MACD Still Relevant in 2025?

Yes - without question. Even with new tools launching every other week, RSI and MACD are still part of many traders‚Äô daily routine. Why? Because they‚Äôre reliable. They‚Äôre simple. And most importantly, they still help people make sense of messy markets.

RSI shows you when a stock or coin might be overheated or running cold. MACD helps you catch trend shifts before they‚Äôre obvious. Neither one promises perfect timing - but both give you a clear signal when things are getting interesting. In a year where noise was everywhere, that kind of signal felt like gold.

# What Are the Alternatives to RSI and MACD in 2025?

There are plenty of new tools out there - especially ones powered by AI and real-time data scraping. Some scan news headlines, social media posts, and even global sentiment to predict market moves before they happen.

Sounds great in theory. But here‚Äôs the reality: those tools come with a steep learning curve. They‚Äôre complex, hard to trust without deep understanding, and often feel more like a black box than a roadmap.

Compared to that, RSI and MACD feel like solid ground. They don‚Äôt require coding skills or data science knowledge. You can read them with your eyes, learn them in a week, and still use them a year later with confidence. That‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt gone anywhere.

# How Do RSI and MACD Help with Disciplined Trading?

Trading isn‚Äôt just about spotting setups - it‚Äôs about staying level-headed. That‚Äôs where RSI and MACD quietly do their best work.

When you rely on these indicators, you‚Äôre not just going off vibes or rumors. You‚Äôre following structure. RSI gives you a warning when things are stretched. MACD shows when momentum is shifting. And once you‚Äôve built your rules around those signals, they become your compass.

That structure helps you avoid emotional trades - the panic sells, the FOMO buys. When you know what you're looking for, you stop guessing. You stay grounded.

# Can RSI and MACD Be Used in Automated Trading?

Yes, and many traders still build bots around them. Because RSI and MACD are rule-based and easy to program, they fit naturally into automated strategies.

But automation doesn‚Äôt mean autopilot. If you're running RSI or MACD in a bot, you still need to monitor performance, adjust settings, and make sure the system isn‚Äôt blindly reacting without context. The indicators work - but only if your overall setup makes sense.

# What Are the Limitations of RSI and MACD in Volatile Markets?

Like any tool, they have blind spots - especially when the market‚Äôs moving fast.

RSI, for example, can stay in the overbought zone during strong uptrends. That doesn‚Äôt always mean a reversal is coming - just that momentum‚Äôs high. Same with MACD: in choppy or sideways markets, it can throw off signals that don‚Äôt really stick.

So if volatility spikes, don‚Äôt ditch RSI and MACD - just use them with caution. Pair them with other tools, look for confluence, and consider adjusting your settings to better fit the speed of the market. They‚Äôre still useful - just not in isolation.

# Final Thoughts

RSI and MACD might feel old-school in a market obsessed with the latest tech. But they‚Äôve lasted for a reason: they‚Äôre clear, practical, and they help traders stay consistent. And in 2025, consistency still beats complexity.",1,1752582058.0,TheFinanceTrending,0,1.0,False

""I'm warning you one last time‚Äîkeep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers‚ÄîMichael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times‚Äîhim finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him‚Äîhe was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me‚Äîdo you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment‚Äîshe'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember‚Äîhe was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fianc√© can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement‚Äîrisking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate‚Äîsurely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment‚Äîmerciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women‚Äîtools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back‚Äînot out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone‚Äînow it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No‚Ä¶ please don't‚Ä¶ don't touch me‚Ä¶""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael‚Äîor her parents‚Äîshe had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth‚Äîshe'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson‚Äîthe girl who'd lived her life‚Äîfelt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned‚Äîvomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away‚Äîbanished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp‚Äîbelieving that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back‚Ä¶ then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim‚Äîputting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena‚Äîlet alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage‚ÄîI don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties‚Äîfor good. Just‚Ä¶ not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter‚Äîso thin and pale, her eyes distant‚Äîand her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter‚Äîstill her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good‚Äîfor your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me‚Ä¶""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant‚Äîgive her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family‚Äîwe should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier‚ÄîEloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained‚Äîshe's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you‚Äîshe told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her‚Äîand for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn‚Äîthat kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside‚Äîyour father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing‚Äîbut somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it‚ÄîMichael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great‚Äîshe's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family‚Äîbut she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now‚Äîof marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house‚Äîwhile Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed‚Äîclearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now‚Äîlooking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous‚Äîfour dishes and a soup‚Äîbut the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten‚Äîthis wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat‚Äîit was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners‚Äîshe looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly‚Ä¶""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them‚Äîcalm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises‚Äîsome new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine‚Äîsoft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow‚Äîagain.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty‚Äîfor her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now‚Ä¶ it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door‚Äîand frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear‚Äîwhat I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""‚Äînot ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years‚Ä¶ how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes‚ÄîAthena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl‚Ä¶ you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless‚Ä¶ I couldn't protect you‚Ä¶""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened‚Ä¶

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word‚Äîand Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now‚Ä¶ and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars‚Äîblackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor‚Ä¶ how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries‚Äîhow did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course‚Ä¶""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten‚Äîfor three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fianc√©'s command‚Äîhow could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes‚Äîbut it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak‚Äîwhen Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak‚Äîif I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine‚ÄîAthena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents‚Ä¶""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is‚Äîwhat are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow‚Äîoffering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course‚Ä¶ she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield‚ÄîHenry Monson‚Äîwalked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'‚Äîwhat, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her‚Äîbut her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face‚Äîbut before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it‚Äîshe's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this‚Ä¶""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt‚Ä¶ I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen‚Äîyet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look‚Äîbut when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician‚Äîit's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly‚Äîit'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just‚Ä¶ don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it‚Äîand saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness‚Ä¶ I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'",1,1752581991.0,BlackNovel,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 35, a writer living alone in an apartment that smells like cedar, old books, and way too much French press coffee. I‚Äôve been single for a while not in a dramatic way but like a plant on a windowsill gone too long without water. 
What I miss isn‚Äôt just sex.

 It‚Äôs the subtle, tender moments no one writes about the soft brush of a hand against skin while cooking, the quiet laugh shared over burnt toast and tangled sheets.

Just yesterday, I stood by the window after a long day, my skin still warm from the shower as I slowly applied moisturizer, feeling the smooth cream glide over my forearms, the scent a whisper of sandalwood and cedar. I put on a crisp linen shirt, its cool fabric brushing against my skin, and for a moment I caught myself longing not just for touch, but for a presence that would know exactly how that little ritual felt. That kind of closeness that doesn‚Äôt need words.

I write stories about love and intimacy, and once a woman told me my words made her cry alone at a gas station in Vermont. That message stayed with me because part of me wants to be that for someone not the tears, but the kind of comfort that softens loneliness.

I‚Äôm good at being alone. I make pancakes that could start a small cult, I talk to my cat like she‚Äôs my therapist, and I can name every moon phase thanks to a librarian I once dated who challenged me. I‚Äôve traveled solo through Lisbon, written handwritten letters in Prague caf√©s, and got hopelessly lost in Kyoto with a dead phone and nothing but a notebook. That afternoon was the best I‚Äôve had in years.

But lately, even my best sentences don‚Äôt reach the part of me that wants to hold someone‚Äôs ankle while she reads on the couch. Or hear the key in the lock and know it‚Äôs her. To feel the heat of someone real. To have skin against mine without it feeling like a stranger‚Äôs.

Most conversations these days feel like performances. You show up at clubs or social gatherings and it‚Äôs the same schmoozing, the same superficial small talk on repeat. I want more than the routine more than polite smiles and rehearsed laughs. I want the messy, the raw, the honest.

I‚Äôm not broken, I‚Äôm just human. And being raw like this means sometimes waking up in the middle of the night whispering ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù into the dark, even when I don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôm saying it to.

""I'm warning you one last time‚Äîkeep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers‚ÄîMichael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times‚Äîhim finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him‚Äîhe was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me‚Äîdo you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment‚Äîshe'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember‚Äîhe was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fianc√© can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement‚Äîrisking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate‚Äîsurely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment‚Äîmerciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women‚Äîtools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back‚Äînot out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone‚Äînow it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No‚Ä¶ please don't‚Ä¶ don't touch me‚Ä¶""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael‚Äîor her parents‚Äîshe had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth‚Äîshe'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson‚Äîthe girl who'd lived her life‚Äîfelt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned‚Äîvomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away‚Äîbanished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp‚Äîbelieving that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back‚Ä¶ then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim‚Äîputting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena‚Äîlet alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage‚ÄîI don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties‚Äîfor good. Just‚Ä¶ not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter‚Äîso thin and pale, her eyes distant‚Äîand her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter‚Äîstill her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good‚Äîfor your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me‚Ä¶""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant‚Äîgive her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family‚Äîwe should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier‚ÄîEloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained‚Äîshe's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you‚Äîshe told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her‚Äîand for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn‚Äîthat kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside‚Äîyour father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing‚Äîbut somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it‚ÄîMichael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great‚Äîshe's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family‚Äîbut she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now‚Äîof marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house‚Äîwhile Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed‚Äîclearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now‚Äîlooking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous‚Äîfour dishes and a soup‚Äîbut the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten‚Äîthis wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat‚Äîit was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners‚Äîshe looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly‚Ä¶""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them‚Äîcalm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises‚Äîsome new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine‚Äîsoft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow‚Äîagain.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty‚Äîfor her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now‚Ä¶ it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door‚Äîand frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear‚Äîwhat I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""‚Äînot ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years‚Ä¶ how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes‚ÄîAthena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl‚Ä¶ you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless‚Ä¶ I couldn't protect you‚Ä¶""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened‚Ä¶

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word‚Äîand Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now‚Ä¶ and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars‚Äîblackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor‚Ä¶ how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries‚Äîhow did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course‚Ä¶""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten‚Äîfor three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fianc√©'s command‚Äîhow could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes‚Äîbut it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak‚Äîwhen Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak‚Äîif I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine‚ÄîAthena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents‚Ä¶""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is‚Äîwhat are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow‚Äîoffering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course‚Ä¶ she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield‚ÄîHenry Monson‚Äîwalked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'‚Äîwhat, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her‚Äîbut her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face‚Äîbut before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it‚Äîshe's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this‚Ä¶""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt‚Ä¶ I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen‚Äîyet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look‚Äîbut when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician‚Äîit's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly‚Äîit'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just‚Ä¶ don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it‚Äîand saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness‚Ä¶ I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'",1,1752581932.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Balanced Meals  

‚Ä¢ Combine complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and healthy fats to maintain steady energy release throughout the day.  

‚Ä¢ Practical options include oatmeal with berries and nuts, or a quinoa bowl topped with chickpeas and avocado.


Hydration  

‚Ä¢ Research shows that even mild dehydration of 1‚Äì2% can impair concentration and memory.  

‚Ä¢ Aim for eight to ten glasses of water daily; infuse with citrus or herbs if you prefer flavor.


Smart Snacks  

‚Ä¢ Dark chocolate containing at least 70% cocoa provides flavonoids that enhance cerebral blood flow.  

‚Ä¢ Mixed nuts supply omega-3 fatty acids and magnesium, both linked to cognitive health.


Caffeine Strategy  

‚Ä¢ Up to 200 mg of caffeine from coffee or tea can improve alertness, but avoid consumption within six hours of bedtime to protect sleep quality.  

‚Ä¢ Pair caffeinated beverages with fiber-rich snacks to prevent energy crashes.


Sleep-Supportive Foods  

‚Ä¢ Late-night study sessions benefit from kiwifruit or tart-cherry juice, both shown to boost natural melatonin production.  

‚Ä¢ Limit sugary or highly processed drinks in the evening to avoid blood-sugar fluctuations that disrupt sleep.

Let‚Äôs break it down simply.

# ‚òï Two Cups, Two Stories

One cup of tea gives you energy ‚Äî a companion for your meetings, deadlines, and morning hustle. Think black tea or coffee. It‚Äôs stimulating and helps you stay alert.

But the **other cup**? It's for winding down. Maybe right before bed or when you're feeling stressed. Herbal teas tend to be floral, naturally sweet, and deeply soothing ‚Äî designed to relax your nervous system and support recovery.

# üîã Caffeine: Fuel or Crash?

Milk tea, green tea, and especially coffee are loaded with caffeine. That gives you a quick boost ‚Äî but sometimes, a crash follows.

Herbal teas, on the other hand, often contain **little to no caffeine**. They‚Äôre made more for balance than a buzz, helping you rejuvenate without over-stimulating your system.

# üåø Where Do They Come From?

Regular teas (black, green, oolong) all come from a single plant: **Camellia sinensis**.

Herbal teas? They're brewed from **a blend of botanicals** like tulsi, chamomile, rose, licorice, and many more ‚Äî each offering its own wellness benefit. When thoughtfully combined, they work synergistically to support the body.

# üßΩ Detoxifying Properties

Certain herbs support your body‚Äôs natural detox systems ‚Äî especially the **liver, kidneys, lymphatic system, and digestive tract**. That‚Äôs why many people turn to herbal teas as a gentle daily detox aid.

# üíö Our Blends Are Crafted with Care

Each herbal blend is thoughtfully formulated ‚Äî from sourcing clean, potent herbs to ensuring each pouch is packed with purpose.

Some of our personal favorite themes:

* **Ageless Grace** ‚Äì For antioxidant support & graceful aging
* **Calm Essence** ‚Äì Helps calm the nerves & ease into restful sleep
* **Glow Beauty** ‚Äì Skin-nourishing herbs for natural radiance
* **Happy Hormones** ‚Äì Balancing support for women‚Äôs cycles
* **Liver Wellness** ‚Äì Gentle detox and digestive support

All of them are rooted in the idea of **plant-based self-care**.

We‚Äôre not here to sell ‚Äî just to share how herbal teas can be more than a drink. They can be **a wellness ritual**. If you‚Äôre into holistic health or trying to reduce caffeine, these alternatives are worth exploring.

If you‚Äôve got favorite blends or rituals, we‚Äôd love to hear them too. üåø

Hi! I'm a 21 yrs old bisexual white woman, and my 26 yrs old white brother has been staying with me for the past two weeks. At first, I was happy to help him in any way so he could eventually get his licence and not depend on anyone, but now I feel uncomfortable and want him to leave. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if I'm right to feel this way.

Here‚Äôs some background:

Our family dynamic has always been strange, and he was kicked out of my house when he was 16. We never lived together after that. He was in foster care at my bio parents from like 8-9 years old to 16 and i was 3-4 years old and 11 i believe when he left. So we grew up together basically. Since then tho, we have basically been on and off contact depending on the family general mood. However i still wanted to built a relationship w/ him which is how i got here.

I had not spoken to my brother in almost 8 months, so when I reached out to him a few weeks ago, I learned that he'd lost both of his jobs. The last time we talked, he was fighting with his boss. When I reached out, he mentioned that he might need a place to stay while looking for work in my town (he doesn‚Äôt owe a car or a license) I offered him my place, even though we don't have a close relationship hoping that from the few talks we‚Äôd had we could built a relationship. I thought this might be an opportunity to finally connect, and he had a few job interviews lined up, so I said yes. Also i somehow feel responsible for the way his life is cause he landed on a second sh!tty family (mine) & was treated like sh!t too, just like me and my bio parents are the type to do everything in their power for you not to achieve anything so i truly wanted to help cause having my license changed my life for the better in multiple ways.

At first, things seemed okay. But after just a few days, I started getting frustrated and irritated by comments, things he did or didn‚Äôt do, etc.. He doesn't have a car, so I had to drive him around a lot, and he kept forgetting things like his clothes, earphones, and gym equipment and even he‚Äôs freaking curriculums. Each thing at a different moment so i had to do like 4 back and forth to get his things for his interviews. He also promised to help with cooking (and hasn‚Äôt, he just brings food from his job and than i do mine and his dishes) and pay a portion of the rent, but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs going to do that. I wasn‚Äôt even the one to bring it up, but every time i do try to bring it up now, he says stuff like ‚Äúbut i also have to pay my other appartement‚Äù. Mind you he is supposed to be making 7k with the job he got here for a month, i was hoping that was going to go towards his car or licence at least. Not the point tho. 

The more I spend time with him, the more I realize how different we are. He‚Äôs never voted, he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in voting, never had a girlfriend or any kind of relationship, and I think he might be into ‚Äúred pill‚Äù content, has no clue what goes around the world, etc.. Told him i don‚Äôt want kids, he said you‚Äôll change you‚Äôre mind you‚Äôre a women, thinks being gay is an illness to a certain extent (mind you i am very bisexual), thinks being trans isn‚Äôt real, you get the vibe. I think at first he was very cautious around me, likely because I‚Äôm vocal about issues like human rights, feminism, and racism, and i am ‚Äúthat girl‚Äù at family togethers who can‚Äôt seem to let that stuff go (which is why i cut all my family off) which he doesn‚Äôt seem to agree with. Before he came here i thought we could at least agree to a certain extent or at least he would be open to learning but the first fees days i tried and ever time he just speaks louder than me. (Like it makes him more right???)

I‚Äôm not rich‚ÄîI live in a small, low-income apartment, and I‚Äôm working two jobs to make ends meet. I work nights and had to print posters to offer cleaning services. I‚Äôve had to be resourceful, finding furniture on the street because I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy anything new, I still do every two weeks all summer hoping to find better stuff or stuff i can make something out off. Also super random but I also make coffee in bulk and keep it in the fridge because of my work schedule, but he often drinks it all, leaving it empty and in the fridge so i don‚Äôt know its empty until i go to get some. Also he doesn‚Äôt close the shower door or the toilet boil seat so my cats leave footprints everywhere. I‚Äôm diagnosed OCD and adhd, i do my appartement cleaning every two weeks. Im starting school again online soon, and im still looking to do more for myself. I‚Äôm very strict about my things because if i don‚Äôt do one, then i start not doing everything. So when he does one wrong things, it ruins my whole day, if not my whole week. 

One big issue is that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own home. I‚Äôm a curvy woman, and I don't wear a bra, which is something I'm fine with. But now I feel like he‚Äôs watching me in a way that makes me uneasy. I had hoped to have an older male figure who would respect me as an equal, but now I just feel uncomfortable going out to the bathroom. Coming out the shower. Going to get a snack. Some might think i‚Äôm pushing it, but others might understand that feeling of being looked at like that, it‚Äôs like he makes me feel like im all naked when im all dressed idk it‚Äôs just weird. It‚Äôs like if he could he would. 

Yesterday, I was supposed to pick him up to bring him to my place for the week, but I didn‚Äôt. I have a door that locks from the inside, and when he showed up unannounced (i don‚Äôt answer nor saw the text message i assumed he would think i was asleep cause of my work schedule) and couldn‚Äôt get in, he knocked on my windows for almost two hours, and I was absolutely terrified yet freaking angry cause my neighbours definitely heard him. At that point i thought there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs going to push, i thought he might call a cab or a friend. He didn‚Äôt. Instead he came in through my window after taking down the AC unit. I pretended to be asleep foor the rest of the time before my night shift. I could hear his footsteps in my room and looking to see if i was sleeping. Honestly felt like a deer in front of headlights and i kinda felt like a prey in my own apartment, my first real home to me. No one comes here, or barely anyone, so idk why i thought this was going to be a good idea. 

To make matters worse, I used to struggle with addiction, and I don't want to go down that road again and have been working very hard for the last couple years to keep it that way, however he still uses. I smoke but other than that nothing, he also smokes my stuff. And when he ‚Äúbroke in‚Äù (i guess) he brought one of his b0ng5 and some strong alcohol. I‚Äôm also uncomfortable with how he talks about women. He doesn‚Äôt seem to believe that women can do as much as men, isn‚Äôt it ironic? 

Some other issues:

He has anger problems and often fights with his employers, including his current new boss.
He drinks regularly, and both my grandfathers and dad are alcoholics. His too. (ask me to stop there too when i lift him, to buy more strong alcohol)
He brought it up to my bio parents that he‚Äôs staying here, even though I specifically asked him not to. (Not sure if my bio dad is still stalking me but he somehow guessed he was here and my brother confirmed)
He has an unhealthy attitude toward immigrants and seems to think he‚Äôs somehow ""special,"" despite being an immigrant himself only he somehow thinks he‚Äôs better because he is a privileged white guy.
My life is finally starting to improve, just cut off my mother, my father, my bio sisters, all of the other foster care ‚Äúsisters‚Äù cause they drained me and I don‚Äôt want to waste my time or energy on someone who doesn‚Äôt support my values and makes me feel unsafe.

If you need more info just ask :)) 
Please help he‚Äôs at my apartment now 

I‚Äôve tried to be open minded, but I literally can‚Äôt handle this. And why would i tolerate someone who doesn‚Äôt tolerate anyone different?

I live in a small building, only six units, paper-thin walls, and neighbors who nod but don‚Äôt really chat. A few months ago, a new tenant moved in two doors down. Mid-thirties, always wore Doc Martens and carried a sketchbook. Let‚Äôs call her Raya.

The first time we spoke, I was carrying three grocery bags, fumbling with my keys, and my dog (a hyper little mutt named Tofu) was barking like I‚Äôd left him for dead.

Raya opened her door, gave me the smallest smile, and held mine open while I tried not to drop a box of cereal and my dignity.

Out of pure chaos and stress, I said, ‚ÄúIf you ever hear barking like he‚Äôs being murdered, it‚Äôs probably just Tofu being dramatic.‚Äù

She laughed. I was flustered. I blurted:  
‚ÄúHonestly, I should just give you a spare key in case he ever locks himself in or something.‚Äù

She said, ‚ÄúSure. I don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

Now, *I know* I shouldn‚Äôt have. But I did. I handed her a copy the next day in a little envelope with a dog treat taped to the front. We never really talked again, besides the occasional hallway ‚Äúhey.‚Äù I figured that was the end of it.

Cut to two weeks ago.

I took a new allergy med and had a *massive* reaction. Swollen face, full-on panic, couldn‚Äôt breathe properly. It hit fast. I tried to get to my phone, but I blacked out on the bathroom floor.

The next thing I remember? Waking up on my couch with an oxygen mask on, a paramedic asking me my name, and Tofu whining by my side.

*Tofu* wouldn‚Äôt stop barking for almost 40 minutes. Nonstop. Raya knocked. No answer. She used the key. Found me unconscious. Called 911. Stayed with me the whole time.

The paramedic said that another 10 minutes and it could‚Äôve been a whole different story.

After the hospital cleared me, I came back home to find Tofu curled up on a new blanket Raya had left out for him. There was also a sticky note on the fridge:

>

We‚Äôve become friends since then. She brings over sketchbooks, I make us coffee, and Tofu acts like she hung the moon.

I‚Äôve been alone for a while now. Not in a sad, collapsing kind of way, more like a plant on a windowsill that hasn‚Äôt been watered in just long enough to feel it. You survive. But you start to ache for sun.

What I miss isn‚Äôt sex, exactly. It‚Äôs the small things that live between the lines: the quiet brush of someone‚Äôs hand on the back of your neck while you‚Äôre cooking. The lazy, half-asleep laugh shared over mismatched socks and burnt toast. Last winter, I was walking home late after a poetry reading, snow in my collar, and saw a couple curled up outside a bakery, feeding each other tiny pieces of croissant like a rom-com no one was filming. I smiled like it didn‚Äôt gut me.

And yes, I write about love. I‚Äôve published a few stories in small journals, the kind of stuff people read at 2 a.m. when they can't sleep and need to feel less alone. A woman once emailed me after reading one of them, saying: ""Your story made me cry at a gas station in Vermont."" I don‚Äôt know why that stuck with me, but I think it‚Äôs because part of me wants to be that for someone. Not the tears , the catharsis.

I‚Äôm not afraid of solitude. I make incredible pancakes, talk to my cat like she understands, and can name the moon phases from memory (long story, blame a librarian I dated once). I‚Äôve traveled alone through Lisbon, handwritten letters in caf√©s in Prague, and once got lost in Kyoto with nothing but a notebook and a dead phone, best afternoon of my life.

But lately, even the most beautiful sentences I write don‚Äôt touch the part of me that just wants to hold someone‚Äôs ankle while she reads on the couch. Or hear a key in the lock and know it's her. To feel the heat of someone real.

I‚Äôm just human. And being human, a little more rawly than usual, means sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and whisper into the dark - I miss you, even if you don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre saying it to. And sometimes I'm feeling ashamed for feeling these feelings.

I didn't expect to meet the man who hurt me again.
""She's just a summer fling,"" he said.
By sunrise, I was gone.
No goodbye. No explanation.
Until I came back to town again.
Aiden Blackwell.
His presence hits me like a slap‚Äîhot and sudden and impossible to ignore.
I glance up, heart lodged in my throat.
He looks... older. Harder. Broader. Dark hair. Scruff lining his jaw.
And then his eyes find mine.
He walks toward me‚Äîcalm, composed, but with a thousand volts behind his gaze.
""Didn't expect to see you here,"" he says, voice lower than I remember. Rougher.
I wrap both hands around my mug. ""Same.""

But here I am, ten years later, with a backseat full of legal files and a heart full of memories I've spent a decade trying to forget.
I pull into the cracked gravel driveway of my mother's house, the tires crunching beneath me like bones. The porch swing still creaks in the breeze. The same hand-painted bird feeder dangles near the steps, chipped but hanging on.
Like me.
I sit in the car a little too long, gripping the steering wheel with both hands as I stare at the house I used to sneak out of. The house where I first fell in love. Where I whispered secrets into the night and once believed nothing could touch me.
That belief died the night I left Aiden Blackwell behind.
Coming back to Cedar Ridge feels like cracking open a time capsule you buried in a fit of nostalgia‚Äîonly to find it moldy, rusted, and full of ghosts.
The town hasn't changed much.
The welcome sign still reads Where Roots Run Deep, as if that's something to be proud of. The same oak trees line Main Street, their branches heavy with spring green. The same old men play checkers outside the barbershop, pausing only to glance up when I drive by. There's even the same peeling ""help wanted"" sign taped crookedly in the window of the hardware store.
It should feel comforting.
Instead, it feels like being watched.
Mom's house smells like lemon polish and memories I'd rather keep locked away. I haven't been back in almost ten years‚Äînot since I left with a suitcase full of ambition and a heart freshly broken by the boy I thought I'd spend forever with.
Now I'm thirty-four, widowed, and dragging back more baggage than I left with.
I drop my duffel on the kitchen floor and glance around. Everything's exactly as I remember, down to the rooster-patterned curtains and the chipped blue tile by the sink. There's a dent in the fridge door from when I lost a fight with a frozen lasagna. It's still there.
So is the ache.
Mom's not home‚Äîshe left early this morning to visit Aunt Joan in Lexington. Said she didn't want to be underfoot while I ""reacclimated.""
Translation: she knew this would be hard, and she didn't want to see me break.
I open the fridge, grab a water, and try not to think about the funeral.
Or the lawyer's voice when he said ""debt restructuring.""
Or the way Jason's family looked at me like I was the reason everything fell apart.
Because maybe I was.
Maybe I always have been.
It was the Fourth of July.
There were fireworks‚Äîliteral and emotional. A humid summer night, thick with mosquitoes, laughter, and the smell of bonfire smoke. Aiden had driven us out to his uncle's old farm, the same one where we used to sneak beers and make out under the stars like nothing in the world could touch us.
I was wearing one of his flannel shirts, tied at the waist, my cutoffs barely visible beneath it. He said I looked like trouble.
I felt like forever.
That night, we made plans.
He was supposed to leave for Austin in the fall, but we were going to make it work. I'd follow when I could. We talked about getting a little place, me enrolling in art school, him working construction until he figured out what he wanted. It wasn't a perfect plan, but it was ours.
Then I went looking for him.
I slipped around the side of the barn to find him. I had a stupid idea in my head‚Äîthat I'd pull him behind the hay bales and smooch him senseless, maybe tell him I loved him out loud for the first time.
But what I found instead was his voice, low and laughing, drifting from behind the truck with a group of guys from his crew.
""She's just a summer fling,"" he said. ""Hot, yeah. Sweet. But you don't keep a girl like Ella Davis‚Äîyou let her go before she ruins you.""
The words hit me like a slap.
I didn't move. Didn't breathe. Just stood there while my world split open.
I don't remember leaving the farm. I just remember the pounding in my ears, the burn in my throat, the way my hands shook as I packed my bags in the dark.
By sunrise, I was gone.
No goodbye. No explanation.
Because if that's what he thought of me‚Äîif all that softness, all those nights tangled in each other's arms, all those promises were just a game‚ÄîI wasn't about to beg him to take me seriously.
But I never stopped wondering if he knew I'd heard him.
Or if he even cared that I left.
Now, I'm back. A widow. A mess. A woman who's done everything right‚Äîand still lost.
I need coffee and since my Mom does not drink it - ""caffeine is bad for you, honey"", I head out to the diner.
The Cedar Ridge Diner is still the heart of the town‚Äîlinoleum floors, coffee that tastes like burnt hope, and a wall of faded photographs showing a town that refuses to forget.
I kill the engine and force myself to get out of the car. The heat hits me instantly, the late-summer air thick with humidity and the scent of dry grass and pine needles.
The bell jingles overhead as I step inside, and every head turns.
It's a full-body reaction, the kind that says Outsider even though I was born here. But then someone whispers my name, and a few of the faces soften.
The town square is as familiar as a scar. The bookstore still has Grace's hand-lettered signs in the window. The florist next door is offering end-of-season sunflowers. And the diner... the diner hasn't changed one bit.
The bell above the door jingles as I step inside, and for a split second, it's like I'm seventeen again‚Äîsneaking in with Grace for pie after curfew, our hair damp from swimming, our skin smelling like bonfires and bad decisions.
""Ella?""
I turn just as Grace Matthews steps into the diner, wind-chimes jingling behind her. Her blonde curls are a little shorter than I remember, her face a little sharper, but the wide smile she gives me? Pure Grace.
She crosses the room in three strides and throws her arms around me before I can say a word. ""I heard you were in town,"" she says, hugging me tight. ""You didn't think you could sneak back without saying hello, did you?""
I hug her back, warmth blooming in my chest for the first time all day. ""Grace.""
She pulls back and studies me, blue eyes narrowing. ""You look... tired. But still beautiful.""
""And you still lie well,"" I tease.
Grace looks just like I remember‚Äîjust a little more polished, a little more tired. Her blonde curls are shorter now, clipped back in a twist that says she's traded late nights and wild plans for bookkeeping and bookstore hours. There's a new edge to her cheekbones, the kind stress leaves behind after too many years of trying to hold everyone else together.
We used to be inseparable. Not quite sisters, but something close.
I remember one night, the summer before everything fell apart‚ÄîGrace and I lying on the roof of her dad's truck, drinking cherry soda from glass bottles, the air thick with honeysuckle and future dreams.
""You know about... Aiden?"" I ask, cautiously.
She hesitates, then nods. ""I know there was something. And I know it broke you when you left.""
I look away. ""He called me a summer fling.""
Her breath catches, but she says nothing.
Because she's not here to judge. Just witness.
""I haven't forgiven him,"" I add.
""Do you want to?""
I don't answer.
Because I don't know.
She smirks. ""You look like someone who's been through inferno and back. And maybe a second detour through purgatory.""
""I have,"" I admit. ""And I'm not done yet.""
Her smile softens. ""I'm glad you're here. I'm just sorry for the reason.""
""Thanks,"" I murmur. ""I wasn't sure anyone would care.""
She snorts. ""Ella, this is Cedar Ridge. We still talk about that time you fell off the hayride and took down the pie table at Fall Fest.""
""Oh my god.""
""Pumpkin filling everywhere.""
We both laugh, and it's the kind that catches in your throat. Too much, too soon. She sees it and gently links her arm with mine.
""You're not alone, okay? You need anything‚Äîcoffee, a break, a place to scream‚Äîmy bookstore is always open for you.""
I nod. ""Thanks, Grace. I may take you up on that.""
""Please do."" Then, with a quick glance toward the door, she adds, ""And... just so you're not blindsided, Aiden's around a lot these days. Practically a fixture, especially with the community center stuff.""
The air stills. My chest tightens. ""So I've heard.""
Grace reads me in an instant. ""You okay?""
I nod. Lie. ""I will be.""
She opens her mouth to say something else, but the diner door swings open behind her‚Äîand I feel it.
That shift in the air. The pull I thought I'd buried.
I don't need to look to know who it is.
Grace follows my gaze, then steps aside with a knowing look. ""I'll call you later.""
And just like that, I'm face-to-face with the ghost I never stopped dreaming about.
The door jingles again.
And the air changes.
I don't even have to look to know who it is.
Aiden Blackwell.
His presence hits me like a slap‚Äîhot and sudden and impossible to ignore.
I glance up, heart lodged in my throat.
He looks... older. Harder. Broader. Like someone who's seen inferno and decided to walk back through it anyway.
Dark hair. Scruff lining his jaw. Arms crossed over a worn t-shirt stretched across a chest that did not exist the last time I saw him.
He's speaking to Maggie, nodding politely.
And then his eyes find mine.
I brace myself.
He walks toward me‚Äîcalm, composed, but with a thousand volts behind his gaze.
""Didn't expect to see you here,"" he says, voice lower than I remember. Rougher.
I wrap both hands around my mug. ""Same.""
He doesn't sit. Just stands there, looking like he wants to say a hundred things but doesn't know where to start.
""You back for good?""
""No,"" I say. ""Just sorting things out.""
A pause. Then a nod. ""Didn't think you'd come back at all.""
""I didn't plan to.""
Another pause. Another almost.
Then he shrugs, like none of it matters. Like ten years didn't just crawl up between us and settle in the booth.
""This town's too small for us not to see each other again,"" he says softly.
And then he walks out.
No fanfare.
No goodbye.
Just gone.
I sit there, stunned.

The owner complains of being surprised by protests that he states seem to harass people, such as a blind man that he mentioned.  The protesters clearly are complaining about the coffee shop‚Äôs stated belief that homosexuality is a sin.

Do you think the protests are effective? A good idea? Clearly there is a concern that LGBTQ homeless would be asked to change in order to receive help. Would it have been better for the advocacy group to request a meeting with the cafe leaders to discuss their concerns?  Do you think the cafe needs to adjust what they‚Äôre doing? Do you think it needs to be closed?

Quick translation of an evangelical term he uses in the video for those without much evangelical background. He says the cafe was started because ‚Äúwe were just convicted.‚Äù Being convicted means to have a spiritual or mystic experience in which one is convinced one needs to behave in a certain way, or cease behaving a certain way. It implies that one has been sinning and needs to stop.  Here, I assume the perceived sin was not helping the homeless.

This is a competitive space, with thousands of applicants daily, so standing out is essential. Read all instructions carefully, be original, and avoid using external tools or AI assistance. These types of sites work with big tech companies that give projects, they can detect this easily. Your answers should be creative yet clear, with proper grammar, punctuation, and structure. Keep your responses concise and to the point. Rambling or adding filler content may confuse the AI and lower your score.

Although the assessments typically don‚Äôt have strict time limits, completing them in one focused sitting is best. Taking too long or pausing mid-way for a break (like making coffee) could be interpreted as a lack of commitment or preparation. Then again, with the number of applicants they get, I wouldn't blame them for getting rid of the slow workers. That said, don‚Äôt rush! Balance quality with reasonable pacing. If you're unsure about a response, take the time to double-check your work. These platforms prioritize quality input to ensure the AI models learn from accurate, well-written content.

Only apply for roles that match your skills. Many people lose access after being accepted because they struggle with project-specific requirements or receive too much bad feedback (R&Rs). Choose projects you're confident in and comfortable with. If a task seems too difficult or unclear, it's better to skip it than risk poor performance. The platforms even recommend taking breaks when tired, as high-quality work matters more than volume.

Also, follow the rules. Don‚Äôt use VPNs, fake identities, or create multiple accounts to game the system. These platforms work with major tech companies and have strict verification processes, including ID checks. If your country isn‚Äôt supported yet, don‚Äôt try to bypass restrictions. Instead, sign up and wait. They‚Äôll notify you if and when your region becomes eligible.

Finally, be patient. Even after passing the assessment and updating your profile, it might take weeks or even months to be assigned your first project. Many users report long waiting periods, so don‚Äôt be discouraged if you don‚Äôt get immediate work. Stay ready, and keep checking your dashboard for opportunities.

I‚Äôve also set up a Discord community, ""WFH Earners Club"", for anyone who wants to get into remote work, learn how to qualify for projects, share progress, and stay motivated. Whether you're new to this or turning side gigs into full-time income, it's a space to connect, co-work, and grow together.

Hi! I'm a 21 yrs old bisexual white woman, and my 26 yrs old white brother has been staying with me for the past two weeks. At first, I was happy to help him in any way so he could eventually get his licence and not depend on anyone, but now I feel uncomfortable and want him to leave. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if I'm right to feel this way.

Here‚Äôs some background:

Our family dynamic has always been strange, and he was kicked out of my house when he was 16. We never lived together after that. He was in foster care at my bio parents from like 8-9 years old to 16 and i was 3-4 years old and 11 i believe when he left. So we grew up together basically. Since then tho, we have basically been on and off contact depending on the family general mood. However i still wanted to built a relationship w/ him which is how i got here.

I had not spoken to my brother in almost 8 months, so when I reached out to him a few weeks ago, I learned that he'd lost both of his jobs. The last time we talked, he was fighting with his boss. When I reached out, he mentioned that he might need a place to stay while looking for work in my town (he doesn‚Äôt owe a car or a license) I offered him my place, even though we don't have a close relationship hoping that from the few talks we‚Äôd had we could built a relationship. I thought this might be an opportunity to finally connect, and he had a few job interviews lined up, so I said yes. Also i somehow feel responsible for the way his life is cause he landed on a second sh!tty family (mine) & was treated like sh!t too, just like me and my bio parents are the type to do everything in their power for you not to achieve anything so i truly wanted to help cause having my license changed my life for the better in multiple ways.

At first, things seemed okay. But after just a few days, I started getting frustrated and irritated by comments, things he did or didn‚Äôt do, etc.. He doesn't have a car, so I had to drive him around a lot, and he kept forgetting things like his clothes, earphones, and gym equipment and even he‚Äôs freaking curriculums. Each thing at a different moment so i had to do like 4 back and forth to get his things for his interviews. He also promised to help with cooking (and hasn‚Äôt, he just brings food from his job and than i do mine and his dishes) and pay a portion of the rent, but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs going to do that. I wasn‚Äôt even the one to bring it up, but every time i do try to bring it up now, he says stuff like ‚Äúbut i also have to pay my other appartement‚Äù. Mind you he is supposed to be making 7k with the job he got here for a month, i was hoping that was going to go towards his car or licence at least. Not the point tho. 

The more I spend time with him, the more I realize how different we are. He‚Äôs never voted, he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù in voting, never had a girlfriend or any kind of relationship, and I think he might be into ‚Äúred pill‚Äù content, has no clue what goes around the world, etc.. Told him i don‚Äôt want kids, he said you‚Äôll change you‚Äôre mind you‚Äôre a women, thinks being gay is an illness to a certain extent (mind you i am very bisexual), thinks being trans isn‚Äôt real, you get the vibe. I think at first he was very cautious around me, likely because I‚Äôm vocal about issues like human rights, feminism, and racism, and i am ‚Äúthat girl‚Äù at family togethers who can‚Äôt seem to let that stuff go (which is why i cut all my family off) which he doesn‚Äôt seem to agree with. Before he came here i thought we could at least agree to a certain extent or at least he would be open to learning but the first fees days i tried and ever time he just speaks louder than me. (Like it makes him more right???)

I‚Äôm not rich‚ÄîI live in a small, low-income apartment, and I‚Äôm working two jobs to make ends meet. I work nights and had to print posters to offer cleaning services. I‚Äôve had to be resourceful, finding furniture on the street because I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy anything new, I still do every two weeks all summer hoping to find better stuff or stuff i can make something out off. Also super random but I also make coffee in bulk and keep it in the fridge because of my work schedule, but he often drinks it all, leaving it empty and in the fridge so i don‚Äôt know its empty until i go to get some. Also he doesn‚Äôt close the shower door or the toilet boil seat so my cats leave footprints everywhere. I‚Äôm diagnosed OCD and adhd, i do my appartement cleaning every two weeks. Im starting school again online soon, and im still looking to do more for myself. I‚Äôm very strict about my things because if i don‚Äôt do one, then i start not doing everything. So when he does one wrong things, it ruins my whole day, if not my whole week. 

One big issue is that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own home. I‚Äôm a curvy woman, and I don't wear a bra, which is something I'm fine with. But now I feel like he‚Äôs watching me in a way that makes me uneasy. I had hoped to have an older male figure who would respect me as an equal, but now I just feel uncomfortable going out to the bathroom. Coming out the shower. Going to get a snack. Some might think i‚Äôm pushing it, but others might understand that feeling of being looked at like that, it‚Äôs like he makes me feel like im all naked when im all dressed idk it‚Äôs just weird. It‚Äôs like if he could he would. 

Yesterday, I was supposed to pick him up to bring him to my place for the week, but I didn‚Äôt. I have a door that locks from the inside, and when he showed up unannounced (i don‚Äôt answer nor saw the text message i assumed he would think i was asleep cause of my work schedule) and couldn‚Äôt get in, he knocked on my windows for almost two hours, and I was absolutely terrified yet freaking angry cause my neighbours definitely heard him. At that point i thought there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs going to push, i thought he might call a cab or a friend. He didn‚Äôt. Instead he came in through my window after taking down the AC unit. I pretended to be asleep foor the rest of the time before my night shift. I could hear his footsteps in my room and looking to see if i was sleeping. Honestly felt like a deer in front of headlights and i kinda felt like a prey in my own apartment, my first real home to me. No one comes here, or barely anyone, so idk why i thought this was going to be a good idea. 

To make matters worse, I used to struggle with addiction, and I don't want to go down that road again and have been working very hard for the last couple years to keep it that way, however he still uses. I smoke but other than that nothing, he also smokes my stuff. And when he ‚Äúbroke in‚Äù (i guess) he brought one of his b0ng5 and some strong alcohol. I‚Äôm also uncomfortable with how he talks about women. He doesn‚Äôt seem to believe that women can do as much as men, isn‚Äôt it ironic? 

Some other issues:

He has anger problems and often fights with his employers, including his current new boss.
He drinks regularly, and both my grandfathers and dad are alcoholics. His too. (ask me to stop there too when i lift him, to buy more strong alcohol)
He brought it up to my bio parents that he‚Äôs staying here, even though I specifically asked him not to. (Not sure if my bio dad is still stalking me but he somehow guessed he was here and my brother confirmed)
He has an unhealthy attitude toward immigrants and seems to think he‚Äôs somehow ""special,"" despite being an immigrant himself only he somehow thinks he‚Äôs better because he is a privileged white guy.
My life is finally starting to improve, just cut off my mother, my father, my bio sisters, all of the other foster care ‚Äúsisters‚Äù cause they drained me and I don‚Äôt want to waste my time or energy on someone who doesn‚Äôt support my values and makes me feel unsafe.

If you need more info just ask :)) 
Please help he‚Äôs at my apartment now 

I‚Äôve tried to be open minded, but I literally can‚Äôt handle this. And why would i tolerate someone who doesn‚Äôt tolerate anyone different? How do I get out of this situation without making things worse? Am I overreacting, or is this behavior truly red-flag-worthy?",3,1752579592.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

We all go through phases of fatigue, laziness, apathy‚Ä¶ and yeah, those are real. But at the same time, there‚Äôs this tool that nature literally gave us, one that boosts our energy on a purely physiological level.

I‚Äôm talking about foods that are rich in slow-digesting carbs. Carbs are energy, right? And slow carbs provide that energy steadily over 4‚Äì6 hours. Unlike sweets and fast carbs that give you a quick sugar hit and a dopamine spike followed by the crash. Classic boom and bust.

Just imagine how knowing this could help you feel more energized during classes, at work, or even just staying present throughout the day. Not just hyped up on coffee in the morning, but actually feeling good at noon and into the evening ‚Äî just by adding lentils, oats, or buckwheat to your meals.

Sure, this isn‚Äôt psychology. But honestly, I think it‚Äôs super important to reflect on how we treat our bodies from time to time.

I am very grateful for the generous donations I received yesterday, which totaled approximately 1200 rupees. It means a great deal to me.

My Samsung Galaxy A12 stopped functioning the day before yesterday. The screen froze for a few hours before completely shutting down. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, including watching YouTube tutorials and visiting repair shops and service centers, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it. I purchased this phone about four years ago for (11k INR). It served me well. The screen had cracked when it fell, and it experienced some lag and glitches, but it remained usable. About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

As a student, I do not own any laptops or tablets, so this phone is my only device. My family is unable to afford a new phone for me, and I do not wish to burden my parents or add to their stress. I am currently working part-time in a bakery, which is the only job I could find, and I will earn approximately $80 (7k INR) before I move out. The pay is not ideal in this part of the world, but it is what I have. While I could purchase a feature phone for a very low price, colleges nowadays rely on phones and laptops for studies. I would need to attend online classes, record audio in class, take pictures of notes, participate in group meetings, study from YouTube or Google, complete assignments, and download materials. The list of uses goes on.

I humbly request any assistance you can offer. Every contribution would be greatly appreciated. I am hoping to raise between (10k INR) and (15k INR) for a phone with a decent camera, battery, and microphone.

I make drip coffee in the morning for the house and usually chug a cup before heading out to drop the kids off. In the afternoon I make an espresso or cappuccino and it always feels like it hits me 2x as hard.

Choosing where to stay depends entirely on what kind of traveler you are. Do you prefer peace and quiet, or hustle and bustle?

Stay here if you're burned out and need to remember what silence sounds like. Just imagine: Wake up to the sight of misty mountains and still, glassy lake waters ‚Äî all in peaceful solitude.

Mornings here are for sipping coffee while watching fishing boats drift across Erhai, afternoons for aimless walks along cobbled lanes, and evenings for quiet sunsets. Perfect for journaling, meditation, or just sitting with your thoughts.

If you want raw Chinese street culture, hit Yeyu Road (Âè∂Ê¶ÜË∑Ø) after 10 PM. This street transforms into pure magic - food stalls light up, people play cards in the drizzle, someone's always got a guitar out singing folk songs.

The mix is surreal: backpackers debating philosophy with local artists, Tibetan traders next to tarot readers, kids playing shuttlecock while parents drink Chinese baijiu. I even saw someone walking their pet pink ostrich at 2 AM!

ou‚Äôll find yourself staying till late night, wondering how hours slipped away while you were busy living in a dream.

1m0fdpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/1m0fdpf/26m_finally_lost_it_and_wanted_to_share_what/,26M - Finally lost it and wanted to share what worked for me,"Hi everyone,

I finallly lost my virginity! I didn't want to leave this sub before telling you what worked for me. Of course, everyone's situation is unique, but I hope there are things from my journey that can help someone.

Some background info: I am well-looking, have a well-paid job in the financial industry, am well read and I think I am quite socially competent. I had, however, a great fear of getting rejected, of being outgoing with women, of taking risks, etc. It was unsufferable. I thought I had a God-given right to have sex and to hook-up but never understood why it didn't come from itself. As is the case with many of you in this sub, I attached my happiness to being a virgin or not. As I later found out, doing this is a symptom, not a disease. A year ago, I met a very nice girl on a dating app. She had everything I look forward in a woman, very similar interests and ways of enjoying life. I, however, could not feel anything for her and I tried to force myself to do it.

On our third date, we were asking each other casual questions about life and she asked me at what age I had lost my virginity. The worst fear from everyone here, I guess. She could not believe I was still a virgin and wanted to know why. I gave her some explanation, she was not judgemental at all, but I pannicked inside and sabotaged myself. I walked her home and ofc she was expecting me to make a move (she allowed me to go into her apartment duh!!!!!). After this disastrous date, she wanted to talk to me because, indeed, she liked me but could not comprehend why I was so naive that night. I was not naive, I was full of fear. She told me I was just ""too good"" and we left it.

After this experience I started going to psychotherapy. I did not know why I reacted that way, why I sabotaged myself and why being a virgin was what defined my whole existence. Therapy is not a holy grail, it is an aid to disentangle a lot (A LOT) of obstacles you have in your psyche. But you have to be willing to put a lot of work yourself. Therapy can aid you to be in the disposition to go out of your comfort zone and to do it in a controlled way, with someone watching over you. And please, please find as good a therapist as you can. You should not save money here, a bad therapist is a grave danger and good ones are usually expensive. But it is money well spent. In summary, therapy for me was the way in which I regained touch with my masculinity. That meant regaining touch with the intuitive part of myself, developing the willingness to take risks and building the tolerance to get rejected time after time, leaving Platonic ideals behind...

Anyway, here is a list of things/ideas/mindests that helped me be ready when I finally found an opportunity to have sex. As I said, some of these things were eased by therapy, but you can do many of them without needing to pay for a good therapist.

\-Do sports, have the desire to look good and to be manly.

\-Put myself in situations where I had to talk to strangers (book clubs, cooking classes, sport events).

\-Go to dance classes (hopefully some latino dance like bachata). This is a hard one. You will be physically close to a woman, doing very erotic moves and you have to show confidence. Very similar to sex. But this is a very safe environment to do some trial and error. In my experience, the girls as just as nervous as the boys in dance classes. Remember that symmetry. And classes are to make mistakes. Then, if you overcome your anxiety, go to a party. Drink two tequila shots and dance with as many unknown girls as you can. Btw, dancing with someone you like feels almost more intimate and erotic than sex itself. So have that as a tool in your box.

\-Invite every women I had some sort of contact with to a coffee. Invite as many people as you can for a coffee.

\-I go to concerts fairly often, so I started talking to by seat neighbors. Once I even asked a girl out, she said no, but still, I tried it.

\-Be a hunter of rejections. The only way for rejections to not hurt is to get used to them. Collect rejections, be happy every time someone rejects you, that means you took your shot and did what was in your hands.

\-Don't go to an escort. That's a dangerous game for your psyche. To overcome the fear of being naked with a woman I went for a tantric massage. The point was to be in the same room with a naked women, feel her and, well, to be jerked-off. This is still miles away from penetrative sex. That's a whole different league for your emotions and your mind. Beware also that this was all agreed upon with my therapist and was done under his supervision and my willingness. This may not work for everyone. Please don't take this as a piece of unconditional advice, just avoid having sex with prostitutes. A massage is just being naked with someone and getting finished-off. Not that emotionally binding. Besides, Tantra can be quite good for regaining confidence in your body.

\-Leave Platonism behind. It's bad. We all idealize our first times way too much. At least I did and that's how I lost many chances to lose my virginity in the past. Truth is, once you start having sex, chances are you will do it again. Great sex will not be the rule. A hook-up is different from making love to your wife, sex after 15 years of marriage can be non-existent, you may sometimes feel in the  mood and sometimes you may not. Remember it's also a game between two people. Good sex is almost a miracle and requires a lot of trust. So don't idealize the first time, that's your baptism, it's there to overcome fears. The enjoyment comes later.

\-The past does not exist. You only can change the present. Don't get stuck in the lost opportunities, in whatever pain you had in the past, in the wounds of life you carry. We all carry wounds! Good news is: you can heal them, or at least be aware of them. If you do that, you will come to realize your virginity is just the way those wounds were manifesting in your life. Before I lost it, I was not caring anymore about my virginity. A year ago I thought about it daily. I woke up and said to myself ""well, another day of being a shameful virgin loser"". In the two or three months preceding my V-card loss I thought about it occasionally, but the thoughts stopped being anxious ones. They just existed, came and went away.

\-Read a lot, watch good instructional porn. Really, this helped a lot. My girl didn't notice I was a virgin. There are great books about how to pleasure a women and, nowadays, even better videos with a healthy view of how to pleasure someone.

\-Instead of jerking-off to unhealthy porn that messes up with your dopamine, do things like Kegel exercises or edging. This will prepare your body for when the moment is due.

\-Don't worry about the expectations of the girl. If you are well above your 20's, chances are you will be with someone experienced. That's very good, actually. Chances are she won't have overblown expectations. The girl I was with did not cum, but she was totally chill about it because ""sometimes she just can't cum"" and was very satisfied with my performance.

\-Have patience. Maybe you come to a point where you say ""fuck everything, I will try my luck at every chance I have"" and are willing to go to all the social events you can. Even then, you might not find anyone. That's frustrating, but you just have to keep trying. The good thing for me was that I stopped caring about being a virgin and just kept going out of my comfort zone again and again as virginity was not a burden anymore.

It all can be summarized into: try, show up. Do what's in your hands. If you have an opportunity to talk to a girl, be mad if you didn't talk to her. Not if she rejected you.

I know this is highly anecdotal, every case is particular, everyone deals with different pains and wounds, but maybe maybe maybe there's something in my experience that will aid you. I can totally relate to the feelings of many in the sub. I really do. I know as well as you do how deep of a hole it feels to be a complexed virgin past a certain age. I know how draining it is and how limiting it is.

Edit: Forgot one thing. Don't fall for advice where you have to change everything about yourself. Tabula rasa does not work.Try to discover the parts of yourself you have neglected and you may think are not part of yourself (e.g. the ones that, indeed, want to be a fuckboy). Don't feel ashamed by them, integrate them to your personality. They will just become one shade of grey more to the totality of your personality. If, like me, you feel like you are a good boy, you don't have to kick that side of yourself away. Just be aware of the side we all have that is not so good and that can be quite helpful for these matters.",4,1752579265.0,virgin,1,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/vr7gme70s0df1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29b929973fe57a819f658611a57e1169f1eea7a

# Understanding the New US Rare Earth Pricing System

Rare earth elements, despite their name, aren't particularly rare in the Earth's crust. However, these 17 critical metals have become increasingly important due to their unique properties that make them essential components in modern technology. These elements are crucial for manufacturing super-strong permanent magnets used in military applications like drone and fighter jets, as well as in electric vehicles and wind turbines.

What makes these elements strategically significant is their irreplaceability in high-performance applications. The magnetic properties of elements like neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) create the most powerful permanent magnets known to science, with no viable substitutes that can match their performance in miniaturized, high-efficiency devices.

# What Are Rare Earth Elements and Why Do They Matter?

Rare earth elements comprise a group of 17 metals that, when processed and refined, become critical components in technologies requiring powerful permanent magnets. These magnets are essential for everything from smartphone vibration motors to missile guidance systems, highlighting their dual importance in both consumer electronics and national defense.

The current global supply chain for rare earths is overwhelmingly dominated by China, which controls approximately 90% of production across mining, processing, and magnet manufacturing. This concentration creates significant vulnerabilities for industries and countries dependent on these materials.

""These elements are the backbone of the green energy transition and modern defense systems,"" notes Ryan Castilloux, Managing Director of Adamas Intelligence. ""Any disruption to their supply represents a critical vulnerability for Western economies.""

# The China Dominance Problem

China's grip on 90% of the rare earth supply chain has created strategic vulnerabilities that extend beyond simple market dynamics. For decades, low prices set in China have effectively removed the incentive for investment elsewhere, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of dependence.

When previous Western companies attempted to establish alternative supply chains, they struggled to compete financially against Chinese producers who could maintain artificially low prices for extended periods. This economic reality has constrained attempts to diversify the supply chain despite the clear strategic risks.

Recent export restrictions imposed by China during¬†[US‚ÄëChina trade tensions](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/us-china-trade-war-impact-global-markets-2025/)¬†demonstrated how quickly supply chain vulnerabilities can transform into actual shortages. These restrictions served as a wake-up call for Western governments, particularly the United States, highlighting the urgent need for action beyond rhetoric.

# The Pentagon's Game-Changing Price Floor Strategy

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has implemented a transformative approach to breaking China's rare earth dominance through a guaranteed price floor system. This marks a significant shift from previous strategies that relied primarily on tax incentives and hoped-for market corrections.

# How Does the New US Rare Earth Pricing System Work?

Under the Pentagon's innovative pricing strategy, the DoD guarantees a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for key rare earths‚Äînearly double the current market price of approximately $63 per kilogram set by Chinese producers. This price floor creates immediate stability for domestic producers, removing the uncertainty that has plagued Western investment in the sector.

The system includes a profit-sharing mechanism: if market prices rise above the $110 floor, the DoD receives 30% of the additional profits, creating potential returns on the government's investment. This approach balances market support with taxpayer protection.

""This benchmark is now a new center of gravity in the industry that will pull prices up,"" explains Castilloux. The guaranteed price effectively establishes a sustainable foundation for the entire rare earth value chain, from mining through processing to final magnet production.

# MP Materials: The Centerpiece of the US Strategy

Las Vegas-based MP Materials stands as the cornerstone of America's rare earth strategy. As the sole domestic rare earth miner in the United States, the company has become the natural partner for the Pentagon's ambitious plans.

The DoD has taken a direct 15% equity stake in MP Materials, becoming its largest shareholder. This move comes after the company suffered a $65.4 million net loss in the previous year, primarily due to China's pricing strategy that kept global rare earth prices artificially low.

MP Materials is expected to begin commercial magnet production at its Texas facility by the end of 2025. The initial production capacity is targeted at 1,000 metric tons annually, with plans to expand to 3,000 tons as operations stabilize. This represents a significant first step toward breaking China's monopoly on the full rare earth supply chain.

# Expanding US Rare Earth Production Capacity

***The Pentagon's rare earth strategy extends beyond simply establishing a beachhead in domestic production. The long-term vision involves creating a comprehensive, resilient supply chain capable of meeting America's strategic needs without foreign dependencies.***

# The Pentagon's Long-Term Production Plans

Beyond MP Materials' initial Texas facility, the Pentagon has outlined plans for a second manufacturing facility in the United States. The combined production target for these facilities is ambitious: 10,000 tons annually, which would match current U.S. consumption of rare earth magnets.

However, this target doesn't account for an additional 30,000 tons already imported in assembled products, highlighting the scale of the challenge ahead. The strategic investment represents a significant shift in how the U.S. government approaches¬†[critical minerals strategy](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/big-pivot-critical-minerals-strategy-2025/).

""This isn't just about magnets‚Äîit's about securing America's technological future,"" a Defense Department official stated. ""From precision munitions to next-generation aircraft, these materials underpin our military advantage.""

# Why Previous US Efforts Failed

Understanding why previous attempts to establish domestic rare earth production failed provides important context for the Pentagon's new approach. Earlier efforts relied heavily on tax breaks and other indirect incentives, which proved insufficient to overcome market realities.

""Tax breaks alone would not create the level of investment required,"" notes former UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, who has studied¬†[energy transition and critical minerals](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/critical-minerals-energy-transition-2025-energy-security/)¬†extensively.

China's pricing power created fundamentally unsustainable market conditions for Western producers, who faced higher labor and environmental compliance costs. Without a coordinated government-industry strategy and price guarantees, financing remained difficult for Western projects despite their strategic importance.

The absence of guaranteed demand and price stability meant that even when Western companies could secure initial funding, they struggled to maintain operations through inevitable market fluctuations engineered by dominant producers.

# Global Market Implications

***The U.S. rare earth pricing system represents more than just a domestic industrial policy‚Äîit fundamentally alters the dynamics of the global rare earth market that has been dominated by Chinese pricing for decades.***

# How Will This Affect Global Rare Earth Prices?

Analysts predict the U.S. benchmark price will become ""a new center of gravity"" for global rare earth pricing. The $110 per kilogram floor is expected to pull prices up across the entire rare earth market, creating economic space for non-Chinese producers to operate profitably.

This price stability creates benefits for other producers like Belgian chemicals group Solvay, which launched a rare earth processing expansion in April 2025 amid China's export restrictions. It provides crucial leverage for non-Chinese producers in negotiations with buyers who now have an alternative benchmark.

""This establishes a sustainable price floor that enables investment in new projects globally,"" explains industry consultant David Merriman from Project Blue. ""The psychology of the market has fundamentally changed.""

# Winners and Losers in the New Pricing Environment

The new pricing environment creates clear winners and losers across the global rare earth supply chain. Primary beneficiaries include rare earth miners and developers globally, including companies like Aclara Resources, which is developing mines in Chile and Brazil with improved environmental standards.

However, higher input costs will impact industrial consumers, including automakers who rely heavily on rare earth magnets for electric vehicle motors. This could potentially lead to price increases for end consumers of products containing rare earth magnets, though the exact impact remains difficult to quantify.

The response from commercial industrial consumers not aligned with government priorities remains uncertain. Volkswagen, for example, issued a statement welcoming ""efforts to strengthen long-term stability"" but notably avoided commenting on the price implications.

# Future Demand and Supply Dynamics

The strategic importance of the Pentagon's rare earth initiative becomes even clearer when examining projected growth in global demand against current supply constraints.

# Projected Growth in Rare Earth Demand

Global demand for rare earth permanent magnets is expected to more than double by 2035, reaching approximately 607,000 tons annually. This explosive growth is driven primarily by the rapid expansion of electric vehicle production and renewable energy infrastructure worldwide.

The United States is projected to have the strongest percentage annual growth rate at 17%, significantly outpacing other markets. This accelerated demand trajectory makes securing stable supply chains even more critical for American economic and defense interests.

Military applications, which often require the highest-grade materials with the strictest performance specifications, continue to necessitate secure supply chains impervious to foreign interference or market manipulation.

# Can Supply Meet Growing Demand?

The current price floor of $110 per kilogram falls within the $75-$105 per kilogram range that experts believe necessary to support sustainable production. However, significant questions remain about the ability to scale production quickly enough to meet projected demand growth.

""Can they scale it up?"" asks Dominic Raab, articulating the central challenge facing Western rare earth development. The gap between current and projected production capacity remains substantial, with few shovel-ready projects outside China.

There's also uncertainty about how non-government backed consumers will respond to higher prices. While defense contractors can pass costs to government customers, commercial manufacturers face more price-sensitive markets, potentially accelerating research into alternative technologies or material substitution.

>

# The Geopolitical Dimension

The Pentagon's rare earth strategy cannot be viewed in isolation from broader geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. The initiative represents a significant escalation in efforts to reduce critical mineral dependencies on America's primary strategic competitor.

# US-China Trade Relations and Rare Earth Politics

Rare earths have become a focal point in ongoing US-China trade negotiations, with China previously suggesting it could use its dominant position as leverage in broader disputes. China's export restrictions highlighted the vulnerability of US supply chains, serving as a catalyst for the Pentagon's more aggressive approach.

The new pricing system represents the most significant escalation yet in US strategic minerals policy, moving beyond rhetorical commitments to concrete market interventions. It forms part of a broader effort to reduce critical mineral dependencies on China across multiple technology sectors.

""This is about more than just rare earths,"" notes a senior defense official. ""It's about establishing a model for securing all critical mineral supply chains essential to national security.""

# Building a Western Rare Earth Supply Chain

Previous attempts at strengthening Western rare earth production were limited to piecemeal deals with premium pricing for specific applications. The new system creates a comprehensive framework for sustainable pricing across the entire supply chain.

This approach has the potential to encourage investment throughout the entire value chain, from mining to processing to magnet manufacturing. However, questions remain about the ability to scale production quickly enough to meet near-term defense requirements.

The success of this initiative depends on sustained government commitment and industrial adoption beyond defense applications. Commercial markets will ultimately determine whether a truly resilient Western supply chain emerges or whether the Pentagon's¬†[executive order on critical minerals](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/trump-executive-order-critical-minerals-2025-2/)¬†remains limited to a strategic niche.

""The economics now work,"" explains Alvaro Castellon of Aclara Resources. ""This creates new strategic paths for producers outside China that simply didn't exist before.""

Furthermore, the ongoing¬†[mining industry evolution](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/mining-industry-evolution-2025-trends-innovation/)¬†will play a crucial role in determining how quickly Western nations can establish competitive rare earth production capabilities that meet modern environmental and social governance standards.

FORT WORTH‚ÄîAt an industrial site in this Texas city, men dressed in head-to-toe protective gear dip giant ladles into a well of molten metal heated to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. They‚Äôre making something the U.S. has hardly, if ever, produced at commercial scale in recent decades: rare-earth metals.

The factory is the most visible mark of MP Materials‚Äô high-stakes, billion-dollar bet that an American company can take on China‚Äôs dominance over the metals‚Äîand the¬†[magnets they power](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/in-depth-features/tech-companies-depend-on-china-for-rare-earths-can-that-change/674228C1-D75A-4598-8597-D68108CDA45F)¬†in everything from cars and smartphones to missile systems.

In recent months, China has used its chokehold over 90% of the world‚Äôs rare-earth magnets to¬†[cut off access](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-flexes-chokehold-on-rare-earth-magnets-as-exports-plunge-in-may-c1adac50)¬†to Western companies,¬†[rattling industrial giants](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/car-companies-production-rare-earth-shortage-aaf87ad2)¬†such as Ford and Tesla and forcing the U.S. to the table for¬†[trade talks](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/trump-xi-speak-amid-trade-tensions-7e637978).

MP has invested more than $1 billion in new infrastructure and equipment. A mine it controls in California has become the largest source of rare-earth minerals in the Western Hemisphere. Now, with its expanding Texas facility and¬†[fresh investment](https://www.wsj.com/business/mp-materials-enters-multibillion-dollar-partnership-with-defense-dept-c8f9f806)¬†from the Pentagon, the company is racing to complete the supply chain so it can start converting large quantities of its minerals into high-grade magnets.

General Motors is signed up to start taking deliveries later this year. The Defense Department last week committed to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in MP and become its largest shareholder, in a deal that will allow MP to increase its planned magnet production to 10,000 metric tons from the previously planned 1,000. As of now, the name of the new factory is simply ‚Äú10x.‚Äù

A White House spokesman said the deal ‚Äúmarks a major step in rebuilding America‚Äôs domestic rare earth industry.‚Äù The company‚Äôs stock jumped around 50% on the day of the announcement, and has tripled this year. Some rivals also gained.

Vulcan Elements, a Durham, N.C.-based magnet maker founded by a former Navy officer, plans to supply the military starting next year. Noveon, in San Marcos, Texas, has signed a deal to supply U.S.-made rare-earth magnets to Japan‚Äôs Nidec, among the world‚Äôs biggest motor makers. German magnet specialist VAC is expected to begin operating a large, Pentagon-funded factory near Sumter, S.C., later this year.

The projects are expected to have a combined capacity to produce several thousand metric tons of the magnets by the end of the year, which adds up to around a third or more of current U.S. imports.

‚ÄúAs we start to build out our permanent magnet manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and elsewhere, China starts to lose that leverage,‚Äù said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.

MP, she added, is ‚Äúessentially working at warp speed to address one of America‚Äôs greatest national and economic security challenges of our time.‚Äù

The company‚Äôs journey there highlights the¬†[hurdles American producers face](https://www.wsj.com/business/u-s-faces-uphill-climb-to-rival-chinas-rare-earth-magnet-industry-11618133603)¬†as they look to reawaken the industry.

# Chinese dominance

China¬†[still holds](https://www.wsj.com/business/how-china-beat-out-the-u-s-to-become-the-top-player-in-rare-earths-refining-e84cc30d)¬†most of the rare-earth cards. It has some of the world‚Äôs best mines. It also has cheap chemicals for processing, a large technically trained workforce and a stomach for handling toxic rare-earth mining waste.

Western producers have long complained that the country uses its dominance¬†[to prevent competitors](https://www.wsj.com/business/china-us-critical-minerals-fight-50b5cbda)¬†from emerging, sometimes by flooding the market with supplies, sometimes by¬†[adopting restrictive export policies](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-controls-minerals-that-run-the-worldand-just-fired-a-warning-shot-at-u-s-5961d77b). Beijing has banned the export of key rare-earth technologies and is¬†[compiling a list](https://www.wsj.com/world/china-to-block-its-rare-earth-experts-from-spilling-their-secrets-8d69b75f)¬†of China‚Äôs rare-earth scientists to ensure they don‚Äôt share their knowledge abroad.

For some companies, finding another source has become critical.

In April, China began¬†[requiring buyers](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-markets-04-05-25/card/china-s-countermeasures-include-controls-on-rare-earth-exports-wraFHBaYSjVO4IunX2VY)¬†of rare-earth magnets to submit elaborate export applications proving they don‚Äôt have military links. The slow processing of these applications forced a Ford SUV plant to temporarily close and sent the wider industry¬†[into a panic](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-still-scrambling-to-get-rare-earth-magnets-2bc0aee6). One auto supplier paid more than $15 a piece for tiny magnets that usually sell for less than 40 cents, according to a trader familiar with the transaction.

‚ÄúWe cannot get any high-power magnets without China,‚Äù Ford CEO Jim Farley said at an event in late June.

Although¬†[U.S.-China trade negotiations](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/u-s-china-trade-truce-risks-falling-apart-over-rare-earth-exports-c36ceb72)¬†have led to two separate truces that were supposed to make magnet supplies¬†[flow again](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-to-approve-exports-of-controlled-items-to-u-s-b2f37389), exports from China have remained lower than anticipated, especially to¬†[defense suppliers](https://www.wsj.com/business/china-rare-earth-magnets-us-production-782677e5).

Some U.S\*\*.\*\*¬†companies have said they are willing to pay a premium for supply-chain security. They may have to. MP and other emerging suppliers don‚Äôt disclose the price of their magnets, but people involved in the industry say they are likely to be, at a minimum, 50% more expensive to produce than China‚Äôs.

# A rare opportunity

The U.S. has significant underground reserves of rare earths, 17 little-known minerals such as neodymium and samarium. Magnets made from the metals are especially strong, able to attract objects hundreds of times their own weight. But mining and processing the minerals is complex and expensive. The country‚Äôs once-thriving industry collapsed in the 1990s and 2000s, unable to compete with China.

A few companies tried at various points to revive it and push into magnet-making. Most failed, incurring big losses for investors. Some in the industry concluded that without government support it was too difficult to beat Chinese prices.

MP co-founders James Litinsky and Michael Rosenthal got into the business almost by accident.

Since the middle of the 20th century, rare earths had been dug from Mountain Pass, a rich deposit in California‚Äôs Mojave Desert that for decades dominated global production.

Molycorp, the previous company to run the mine, went bankrupt in 2015 after a surge in Chinese rare-earth exports tanked prices. Litinsky and Rosenthal, childhood friends with backgrounds in finance, had invested in Molycorp bonds, hoping to turn a profit. Few others wanted the mine, and the pair worried that a key strategic asset would be abandoned. In 2017 they gained control of Mountain Pass.

‚ÄúThere was a belief that it couldn‚Äôt be fixed,‚Äù said Litinsky, MP‚Äôs chief executive.

He had gotten rich as a young man, after founding a successful Chicago hedge fund at the age of 28, but was looking for a new challenge. ‚ÄúI certainly didn‚Äôt know what I was getting myself into.‚Äù

MP needed to generate money, and fast, but Litinsky and Rosenthal encountered a bottleneck. Once the ore is mined, it has to undergo a complex process to separate the rare earths from the rock and then isolate the individual minerals. Almost no one outside of China knew how to do that at affordable prices.

Hiring was difficult; the mine had just eight workers‚Äîand a lot of wild donkeys‚Äîon a remote site that today sits near a billboard with an alien dressed in a cowboy hat advertising beef jerky.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got no money, we‚Äôve got eight people, the site was bankrupt, everyone says the U.S. can‚Äôt make rare earths,‚Äù said Rosenthal, the company‚Äôs operations chief. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt go to an engineer and say ‚ÄòWant to leave Rio Tinto to join us?‚Äô‚Äù

MP struck an agreement with a Chinese rare-earth company, Shenghe Resources, to provide upfront financing, in exchange for a small stake in MP. Shenghe would then sell MP‚Äôs ore to buyers in China, who refined it and then created magnets

As MP got on firmer footing, it used the money it earned from the arrangement to start building its own processing operations. The Pentagon started chipping in grants that came to around $100 million.

# Steep learning curve

Although MP‚Äôs initial processing operations removed rare earths from the rest of the ore, the company still had to separate out the individual elements, each of which is nearly chemically identical. Rosenthal likened the challenge to designing a chemical process to sort out blue M&Ms from the rest of the M&Ms, and then extracting the cocoa from those candies.

MP built up a plant in California filled with giant vats, called settler-mixers, that gradually winnow out the most valuable rare earths needed in magnets.

By 2023, it was the only U.S. company separating rare earths at commercial scale, allowing it to bypass Chinese refiners and start selling directly to buyers in the U.S., Japan and South Korea.

It is now expanding to separate another class of rare earths: strategically important heavy rare earths, which MP has been stockpiling at its mine.

Despite the progress, the company struggled to stay consistently profitable.

Starting in 2022, a surplus in Chinese rare earths tanked global prices, part of a pattern of Chinese overproduction of critical minerals including nickel, lithium and cobalt that has forced out Western miners around the globe. As prices kept dropping, investors lost patience. MP‚Äôs stock crumbled to a fifth of its previous highs.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to be betting behind losing horses,‚Äù CNBC analyst Jim Cramer said last year.

Litinsky believed the company‚Äôs strategic importance would at some point translate into financial results. But the company still needed to learn how to actually make magnets, as opposed to just processing the ore and sending the minerals to others.

First, they‚Äôd need to find the people who could help them.

# Magnetic flux

Since rare-earth magnets are hardly made in the U.S. anymore, many of the people with commercial experience are in their 60s and 70s. MP scoured the world for technical talent, netting an executive with experience at a European magnet factory and others with backgrounds at magnet material companies outside of China.

To lead the project, the company hired Alan Lund, a metallurgist who had run a company developing high-performance metal alloys.

Lund was determined to find an anchor customer that would commit to a long-term sales contract. It turned out to be GM, which had analyzed its supply-chain vulnerabilities after¬†[Covid-induced shocks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-outbreak-could-affect-production-at-2-gm-plants-union-officials-say-11581697246)¬†and wanted more options.

The next hurdle was finding production equipment for its Fort Worth factory. MP didn‚Äôt want to buy in China, the main producer of magnet-making machinery, afraid that Beijing could hold up shipments. That meant seeking out suppliers of tools such as jet mills and furnaces in North America and Europe.

The equipment was more expensive and sometimes required a nearly two-year lead time. But MP‚Äôs decisions looked prescient in 2023, when China began expanding export controls to include magnet-production equipment.

MP also had to master the arcane engineering skills needed to make top-quality magnets, including grain boundary diffusion. That process, often abbreviated as GBD, is a way to apply the most expensive materials in a targeted way on the magnet, dramatically lowering the cost.

China is good at it; few others are.

Long before breaking ground in Fort Worth, MP assembled a dedicated team at a small industrial space dubbed ‚Äúthe Garage‚Äù‚Äîand sometimes called ‚ÄúBobcat‚Äù‚Äîto pore over scientific literature and crack the magnet code. Over several years, the company tested different formulations, eventually developing a heavy rare-earth composition that used GBD, and a customized method that gave magnets a consistent coating.

Now, the company is gearing up for commercial-scale magnet production. The front entrance of its Fort Worth plant has a giant American flag composed of red, white and blue hard hats. Compacted rare-earth powders are placed on heat-resistant racks and stuck into furnaces.

Its goal to become a national rare-earths ‚Äúchampion‚Äù that can go toe-to-toe with China was turbocharged last week.

[The company relies on non-Chinese suppliers for equipment, which has lengthened lead-times and added expense.¬© Trevor Paulhus for WSJ](https://preview.redd.it/7nj5bhd2k0df1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=43812623675f2f28907c29460e626a177553445d)

Under the deal reached with the Pentagon on Thursday, the Texas plant‚Äôs magnet capacity will be tripled and MP will build a second, larger plant. To protect against price fluctuations, the government is setting a price floor for MP‚Äôs rare-earth minerals and guaranteeing the purchase of MP‚Äôs magnets, giving the company the confidence to plow ahead. Because the Defense Department will likely only require a portion of the magnets, the rest can be sold to commercial customers, like automakers.

But challenges remain. As MP scales up magnet production, it will need to acquire more heavy rare earths than are available at its California mine, which is no easy feat because there are few producers of those outside of China. Building and operating a massive new facility could also create new snags.

Some of its Western competitors say the government‚Äôs decision to invest so heavily in a single company could drive promising startups out of the business, hurting U.S. competitiveness over the long term.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the government picking winners and losers,‚Äù said an executive at one rare-earth business, ‚Äúand they seem to have made a big bet on one company.‚Äù

# üè≠ 3. Implications for U.S. Defense & Private Industry

* **For DoD stockpile**: TiCl‚ÇÑ is industrially critical (pigments, aerospace coatings, catalysts); potential offtake could provide stable demand & support timely financing.
* **Industrial downstream**: High-purity TiCl‚ÇÑ from NioCorp could foster U.S. chemical, pigment, aerospace, medical alloy sectors‚Äîreducing dependence on foreign sources.
* **Defense resilience**: Aligned with DoD goals (per NDAA & DPA) to diversify mineral supply for critical materials; supports U.S. under-shoring agenda.
* **Financing leverage**: With stockpile or offtake deals, NioCorp‚Äôs risk profile improves, paving the way for access to DPA funds, EXIM financing, and private-private co-investments.

If NioCorp secures integrating TiCl‚ÇÑ into a DoD offtake or stockpile agreement would:

1. Anchor stable demand.
2. Enhance national security and supply-chain resilience.
3. Support new U.S. chemical and defense manufacturing capabilities.
4. Unlock federal financial mechanisms (e.g., DPA/EXIM/stockpile support).

1m0f7id,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1m0f7id/challenge_roth_inperson_registration_my_experience/,Challenge Roth in-person registration (my experience),"Hello everyone, I thought I would share my experience of getting the Challenge Roth in person registration this year. 

For context, my brother and I have been trying a spot at Roth for years (same as most here probably) but we were never successful no matter what tactics we would employ. I've come so far as to take only 7 (seven!) seconds to complete my input and still miss out. Fast forward to last December when I moved from the US to Bavaria, just over one hour north of Roth, so the option of actually signing up physically became real.

The race this year happened on the 6th of July, meaning the in-person registration was scheduled for Monday, July 7th at 9am.¬†

I've looked up everything I could regarding tips and tricks for how to make sure I would get a spot, but there is surprisinlgy little info online, even Chat GTP only repeated the obvious.

¬†

So, I was intially planning on going to the line at around 2am, but thankfully my anxiety was stronger than me and I packed all my stuff into a park trolley (park chairs, blankets, warm clothes, lots of food and drinks, book, tablet you name it) and arrived at the line at 7pm of Sunday. I was the 69th in the queue, so from the get go I was pretty confident it would work as I had heard several people saying they would be handing out about 1000 registrations. I have no clue at what time the first ones got there, but 7pm was more than enough. The atmosphere was also great, as the line formed right next to the last few hundred meters of the running course, so we could watch everyone finishing, which was great. Food, drinks and toilets were all there within walking distance. Food and drinks kept being served until about 1am, toilets stayed open through the night. It was actually pretty chill, we had good interactions with fellow athletes and it was also very safe, with security people around all night.¬†

We only had to move the queue at about 1:45am as the security folks told us we couldn't stay there for whatever reasons. This, however, was very well managed. The guy next to me in line actually woke me up, and to my surprise everyone that had arrived before me was gone. At first I didn't understand anything, but they quickly told me what was going on, and they all made sure that we would go one by one to the new line, so that there was no chance anyone would jump the line. Very well managed.

The coffee truck started serving coffee and muffins at around 6:30am again and most people took advantage of it, only to find out that at about 8:30 the Roth organization themselves came around with golf carts completely packed with all kinds of pastries, sandwiches, hot coffee and tea, hot chocolate, absolutley mental, very very nice and all for free. Absolute legends.

**Shortly before that, around 7-7:30 they had started handing out flyers with your number in the queue**, so I got the 69 and 70 for my wife and I. But, if you are planing on doing this, be aware that you **HAVE** to be in the line when they hand out these flyers. They do not hand more than one per person, even if you tell them that the other person just went to the toilet or so. But to be fair, the people I saw saying this all got therir flyers, as the people handing them out would actually patiently wait for folks to return to the line, all very chill.

With that flyer in hand we went and formed a new line, in front of the registration office and waited until 9am. That's when the office opened and everyone with a flyer could go in, pay and receive their signup code. It went really well and fast, as the registration itself is only done afterwards online (you have a few days to complete it).

**In summary:**

Be there early, if possible the day before. Again, I was there at 7pm and got spot #69-#70.¬†

By 6am I've heard people saying there were over 1000 people in the line already.¬†

There are athletes that finish the race and then go stand in the line again, like immediatelly.¬†

Bring a blanket or a tent (there was a lot of people camping)

Bring food and drinks, but know that there is also warm food and beverages to buy almost the entire time.

Toilets are available.

Safety is great, I didn't feel like anyone would mess with us at any point.

They don't start disassembling the Challenge structure until about 8am, so there is actually no noise during the night.

Know that you need to be in the line at all times from about 7am, do not leave the line thinking it only starts at 9am, you will miss your spot.

The Challenge organization does hand out really good food in the morning.

**Understand that all you need at the 9am is a credit card. They don't ask for ID or anything, you just need to get the flyer, get rid of your money and grab the code. The registration is done later online.**

I always found that planning good survey questions was a huge time sink. You're trying to figure out the right way to ask things without being biased, and it can take forever.

So, I built a small tool to help with this. I'm calling it Formavy.

How it works:

 1. You give it a simple prompt (e.g., ""customer feedback for a new coffee shop"").

 2. It generates a list of potential survey questions for you.

 3. The coolest feature: You can also give it your old survey responses, and it will suggest new, more targeted questions based on the feedback you've already received.

I'm hoping this can help students, researchers, or startup founders speed up their feedback process.
I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think! I'm looking for any and all feedback.

So I (29M) have recently had 2 women in my life, Gina (27F) and Sasha (29F) - fake names obviously. Let me tell you about both of them:

**Gina**

I've been seeing Gina for about a month and a half now - she is sweet, intelligent, hardworking and kind. I like her and we've been going on nice dates and sleeping with each other, she also lives 10 minutes away. We seem to be on the same page with a lot of things, the thing is that she lives with her parents and has to be home by 10 every day which has meant no sleepovers so far, and she doesn't like taking public transport and prefers to drive which means that in the city we live in doing stuff outside of our local area is a bit of a hassle. So these things combined make me wonder how things will progress since I want to go on fun dates and not basically date as if we're teenagers - I like her but things don't feel super intense, it's very chill, we've never had an argument, we get on fairly well, but we don't have loads of banter. It's still early days though.

**Sasha**

I had seen Sasha for about 2 and a half weeks, we hit it off right away and our second date was really good, I came over she said she wanted to wait to have sex which I'm totally cool with and then we basically chatted and cuddled for hours, made out and did some above the belt stuff, I stayed the night and in the morning we drank coffee and watched the news. The vibe was great, it felt really easy, we laughed a lot and had good banter. She was really keen to see me again after and I wanted to pump the brakes a little, at one point she went on a first date with someone that she had planned from before we met and spent the whole date texting me and asking to come over which I declined and eventually I got annoyed at her for insisting and she apologised and thought I was going to dump her. 

She came over the next day and we had a nice time chatting, cuddling and making out. Whilst she was here she told me she slept with someone she had a casual thing with between our first and second date but it was more of a goodbye - I wasn't mad about this - after all it was one date, we're not exclusive and I've been sleeping with other people as well. Then she told me she had paused her dating apps and wanted to focus on dating one person at a time. She asked me if I was seeing/sleeping with anyone else and I said yes. A couple of days later she tried to make plans with me on the weekend and I couldn't, so she ended up seeing that guy again and sleeping with him. She told me this and then we basically had an argument about it and I told her that we're not exclusive but I'm annoyed that she went back on her word and that it seemed like she was trying to make me jealous. 

She came over last night and we talked and it basically transpired that she wasn't used to dating multiple people and felt like she was being forced to not put all her eggs in one basket. I got the impression that she liked me a lot and got scared of getting hurt and that's when things started to get a bit messy. She told me the situation made her quite anxious and she doesn't feel like it's a good way to start a relationship. This morning we decided it was best we called it there before we both really got hurt. 

I feel kind of lost and stupid - I feel like I'm dumb for walking away from something that was great and got messy because of external factors, I haven't felt intensely about someone like I have with Sasha in quite a long time and I'm tempted to tell her that I want to give things a go with us not seeing anyone else. On the other hand part of me thinks I'm being childish and I would be throwing away a really good thing I have going with Gina because I think the grass is greener on the other side and maybe I should follow the more mature, less drama filled path.

I can't really tell, some outside input would really be appreciated.",1,1752578317.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1m0f2q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/deathnote/comments/1m0f2q2/i_dont_think_lights_plan_shouldve_worked_a/,I Don't Think Light's Plan Should've Worked: A Manifesto By An Idiot Who Has Had Too Much Coffee,"**Prologue**

Light‚Äôs plan of forfeiting the Death Note to clear up his name, just to regain ownership of the Death Note and allow himself a free pass with the 13-day rule sucked. In this post, I will go over the evidence of why this should have never worked, and furthermore, why L should‚Äôve only confirmed his suspicions of Light being the definite Kira and Misa Amane being the second kira right there and then.



**Cards On The Table**

Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. L has found Kira to be a highly intelligent student in Japan who has direct access to the Kira investigation, meanwhile Light fits that profile perfectly. Furthermore, Light was one of the people shadowed by Ray Penber, and tracing back the death of the FBI agents leads us to believe that he is one of the few plausible suspects that L likely has.



From a neutral point of view, Kira had no reason to kill these FBI agents. Furthermore, it is highly suspicious that they died through agent Penber in the first place, making it all the more likely that Light is Kira.



This alone is not enough to convict him, though. We will now address the story of the Second Kira.



**The Second Kira (And why It‚Äôs Suspicious)**

In the thirteenth episode we meet our Second Kira. This imposter gives us a number of dates and places on which he might meet the First, and perhaps of equal importance, he or she eventually tells L, although likely as a bluff, that it is perhaps possible for the Kira‚Äôs to share their powers with others. This detail cannot be overlooked.



Eventually, Light meets Misa. Furthermore, L confirms that it is highly likely that the two Kira‚Äôs had already met by the time the imposter gives us her final message. We know that the time they had met correlates with the time Light (primary suspect) visited Aoyama, and though this detail alone should be enough to have Light incarcerated in my opinion, it still isn‚Äôt decisive evidence of any sort.



**The Switcheroo**

What is decisive, is that Misa‚Äôs DNA is found on the tapes delivered by the Second Kira. All the evidence points toward her being guilty. Even more so, when detained she does not resist, she barely talks about Light and their relationship, and she certainly doesn‚Äôt say a thing about Kira.



Then, she forfeits ownership of the Death Note. She begs someone to kill her, and after that, her hair moves in a suspiciously unnatural way, she becomes unconscious, and has a change of heart.

**Now as For Light‚Äôs Story**

Light volunteers to have himself detained, but by this point, there is no change of character, this is all premeditated and perfectly in character for a Kira who has become desperate. After detainment, the killings stop, nothing major happens. Just like how Misa‚Äôs involvement with the tapes pretty much confirmed their suspicions, Light‚Äôs effect on the killings do raise suspicions as well.



Then, Light has a change of heart. Let me state this clearly: L is a masterful detective. Detectives as well as the FBI specialize in code and hidden language under distress, there is no reason that L shouldn‚Äôt have felt that Misa was somehow communicating with whatever had given her the power to kill.



Furthermore, if L really thought this through, he would‚Äôve come to the following conclusions:

* The power of a Kira is given, likely by some higher power. This is not something they discovered.
* The power lies in some form of written content. The need for a name, the envelope found under Ray‚Äôs jacket, it all points to a system in which a Kira kills through written information. We have been given the sufficient info to deduce that much without being a member of the audience.
* Light is a primary suspect, yet the killings continued while he was in his room studying. That means that while prisoners were being murdered, the only thing linking Light to the murders that were happening at that time was his notebook or the piece of writing that he was using for his homework. Furthermore, the scene where Light, a disciplined student who he had previously never even seen close to such an unhealthy snack, grabbing a bag of potato chips with notable backlash from his sister should‚Äôve ticked L off, but for the sake of not reaching, I will give this fact a pass.



Given all these conclusions that L could‚Äôve reasonably made, and the mentioning of a notebook by Misa (second kira), these facts should‚Äôve been clear as well:

* It is likely that Shinigami really do exist, and that some sort of notebook is used in writing the names of the victims.
* It is likely that Kira cannot kill anyone he hasn‚Äôt seen before, but the second kira contradicts this theory. This means that there must be a difference in power between the two kira‚Äôs, however, their method of obtaining such power seems consistent.
* It is likely that the two kira‚Äôs have met, and that fact along with the suspicions of both L as well as Misa weakly confirms their guilt. Imagine if two murderers are suspected for related crimes, and later on, the two primary suspects are seen in public without any previous connection, though they don‚Äôt live closely to each other. How exactly would Light have met Misa in the first place? Major plot point and highly suspicious.



**I Will Stop Keeping You Guys In Suspense**

Both Misa and Light were suspects in the case, and Misa had left confirmed DNA on much of the evidence concerning the Second Kira. After suspicious behavior, Misa was ‚Äúknocked‚Äù unconscious, had a change of heart, and I‚Äôm only assuming that during this time the murders by the Second Kira stopped considerably. I don‚Äôt think this is really mentioned in the Anime, though it might be, I‚Äôm not sure.



Furthermore, Light has this same change of heart after another suspiciously worded dialogue, after which he becomes a new person entirely, contradicting everything he had wanted to do before.



Now, the real evidence lies in the new Kira. For all this time, Kira had killed nobody, not a single person, but now, once Light and Misa have had their change of heart, only now Kira decides to kill again, despite the evidence, and in ways foreign to the original Kira‚Äôs.



In other words, imagine if there is one shadow murderer who kills a streak of prisoners in suspicious ways, then another who does so as well, the two primary suspects meet and are put under strict surveillance, during which the killings stop entirely, until they have a change of character, and after that, the ‚Äúsame murderer‚Äù continues but following a different streak of victims that resembles nothing to the original Kira or his imposter.



Above all, we don‚Äôt even have proof that this new Kira is the same perpetrator to begin with. We suspect it must be the same Kira, but given the show‚Äôs arc so far, there is already a certainty that multiple Kira‚Äôs can exist at the same time. L could‚Äôve figured that out before, why didn‚Äôt he now? In that case, the odds of Light and Misa having been Kira at some point should‚Äôve jumped to at least 95%, making it pretty much a given that they were, at some point.



**TLDR: The Timing Is Off**

Imagine if there is a hamster that can make people disappear by interacting with them. A hamster named Chubby has this power, and we lock him up, and suddenly, no person disappears for an entire period of time. On a certain day, Chubby completely changes his diet and behavior, and only after that fact, though a little time has passed, the mysterious hamster starts making people disappear again. But there is a catch: this previous hamster went after criminals, our new hamster goes after predominantly business-related personnel. We know that multiple hamsters can exist at the same time, and as far as we know of, the hamster who killed criminals in his old pattern still hasn‚Äôt returned.



By forfeiting ownership of the Death Note, Light didn‚Äôt clear his name, he killed the Kira that he had created: a methodical mastermind who killed exclusively criminals and opposition, in ways unique to him. This is his footprint, and that footprint is still gone, though the killings have resumed. This new killer looks nothing like the Kira we know, and more importantly, like I said, we know how Kira can share his powers as well as the fact that there can be multiple Kira‚Äôs at the same time. L should‚Äôve not only deduced that this is not the same Kira, Light‚Äôs name should‚Äôve never been cleared, because by forfeiting ownership, Light kept the original Kira quiet and simply replaced him with a whole different person, that is only more evidence that he is most likely Kira.

**Just In Case**

Like every other time that I post on Reddit, I'm expecting a lot of hatred from losers who have nothing better to do. This is my take, you may disagree, but keep it civil.

Please share any others you have with me! üòÅ 

1. Cleaning the kitty litters has got to be my most difficult task. But one thing I swear by is LINE THE TRAYS WITH PUPPY PADS! Omg, life changer. You just pick up the pad by the corners and chuck it in a rubbish bag. The litter box always stays clean! And takes 2 seconds to empty. 

2. I‚Äôm terrible at cleaning up after myself in the kitchen. Now I put a coles paper bag on the kitchen counter always. And I just chuck rubbish in it as I‚Äôm passing. Or I chop up vegetables next to it and I can just chuck away all the scraps straight away with no effort. Helps me stop throwing rubbish on the bench. I don‚Äôt even use a normal bin anymore.. I just replace the coles bag when it‚Äôs full.. 

3. Sometimes I have let the dishes pile up and I have no pots to make pasta in. The thought of hand washing a pot is sometimes so overwhelming I‚Äôd rather just go to bed starving.. use a frying pan. üòÖ honestly, no body cares, the frying pan works! And you‚Äôve got a full belly to start your day again in the morning. 

4. This one‚Äôs hard and I know not always possible based on how you feel. But if you‚Äôve done a whole house clean recently, try your absolute best to just put dirty dishes in the dishwasher at night before bed, remove any rubbish off the counter and put things away, and just wipe the bench. Honestly when you walk out to a clean room in the morning, it makes your whole day sooooo much easier! And you feel so much better and motivated being surrounded by a clean room and not mess first thing in the morning. 

5. If you‚Äôre waiting for your kettle to boil in the morning, or you‚Äôre waiting for a pot of pasta to cook, don‚Äôt sit down and wait. Just empty the dishwasher/put new dishes on. It‚Äôll be done by the time your coffee is ready üíú Sometimes I cry whilst doing it because I don‚Äôt want to do it.. but afterwards I‚Äôm always so grateful to myself that it‚Äôs done. 

6. This one maybe depends on where you live. Where I live in summer people hang their clothes out to dry. I do not. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs 40 degrees outside and the clothes will be dry in an hour.. I‚Äôm using the dryer. Nobody knows, nobody cares. Just make the task the easiest it can be on yourself. 

7. Most importantly, if you can get one chore done a day in 5 minutes. Just do it, doing one thing each day is going to make it so much easier on yourself. I promise.

also I use AI BUT THERE'S A CATCH I ONLY USE TO MAKE MY GRAMMAR BETTER OR CORRECT WORDING I MADE THE PLOT AND I MADE THE CONVERSATION! ( My heart is fragile and it hurt that I saw one Reddit guy saying I was lazy and not a writer when I spend a long time on my novel)

Ok so I was confuse and hesitate whether to make my novel pure action or have a little romance.... In my vision I should make it pure action but I also hesitate as I put myself in the MC perspective and it seems too pitiful if I just make his life one sided. But also that the romance may dilute the vibe.


Okay guys this is the chapter I was stuck

--

While looking for something to defend himself and planning his way out, Jiang Dao noticed a black bead nestled in the shadow-drenched corner, half-hidden beneath a coating of dust and debris.

He was drawn to it as he swallowed his saliva unconsciously, the motion audible in the oppressive silence. A strange pull emanated from the obsidian sphere, like gravity itself had shifted to favor this singular object.

He had a strong intuition that he would need this to survive‚Äîan animal instinct clawing at his consciousness.

Pinching his arm, the sharp pain snapped him back to reality as he stared at the bead with mounting fear. The dim light from the cracked window seemed to avoid touching it, as if even illumination recoiled from its presence. He didn't know what it was, but in this kind of situation, this didn't look good. This situation reminded him of horror movies where the character takes something that shouldn't be moved, which results in either death or disability.

But after thinking about his current situation, with the metallic taste of blood still coating his tongue and the acrid smell of smoke drifting through the broken walls, he didn't seem to have many choices. The difference between not picking it up and picking it up was just death now versus death later.

But one choice was something his body desired with an almost painful intensity.

Damn! Let me trust you this once, my instinct.

Crawling forward through the scattered glass and debris, stretching out his trembling hands, he picked up the bead‚Äîfeeling its unnatural warmth pulse against his palm like a second heartbeat.

What is this? Jiang Dao thought as he suppressed the gnawing hunger he felt rising from his very core.

Suddenly, Jiang Dao smelled a strange odor like something from a sewer. Even with the rain and blood, it was noticeable.

""It's here!""

Swallowing his saliva, he tried to calm down and analyze where the smell was coming from to begin his escape.

""On the left side, probably on the same floor as me...""

Jiang Dao turned his eyes toward the window but quickly shook his head. This was the third floor‚Äîjumping from here might not result in death, but he wouldn't be able to run away if the thing heard the sound.

Replaying his memory, he realized that the best escape path would be to go to the first floor using the stairs, but if in a hurry, he could jump from the second floor.

Clenching the dagger he had picked up from the middle-aged man, he steeled himself and slowly opened the door.

Creak!

Oops! Damn!

Jiang Dao cursed inwardly as he realized he was in trouble.

A low-pitched sound that could send shivers down one's spine rang out from the left.

Opening the door violently, Jiang Dao quickly dashed toward the right as he felt a sense of doom approaching.

Haa! Haa! Faster!

Bypassing obstacles with parkour-like skills and going down the stairs, Jiang Dao was surprised at what he could do under pressure.

Boom!

The sound of something falling, along with slippery movement, echoed behind him as Jiang Dao quickly headed toward the window closest to him and jumped without hesitation.

Ahhh!

Jiang Dao felt pain shoot through his legs, but fortunately, nothing was broken. Without time to think, he quickly got up and ran wildly through the rain. With a speed and focus he couldn't muster even during major exams, he climbed up a mossy wall made even more slippery by the rain.

""Haha, I'm safe now... ""

Looking at the people in front of him Jiang Dao laughed, but he wasn't careless and quickly got away from the wall, heading toward the bus stop they had taken while coming here.

Beyond the wall was an old neighborhood where very few people were in sight‚Äîat most just a few guys sipping coffee at a shop.

An older man with white hair was attracted by the sound of falling and was surprised when he noticed it came from that wall.

When he saw someone laughing like crazy with messy clothing full of holes, his pupils shrank as he quickly stood up and ran away from there. Because of the rain and distance, the dried blood wasn't noticed‚Äîotherwise, everyone here would have gone running for their lives.

.....

Pat pat...

After a long walk, Jiang Dao finally reached the bus stop and sat waiting. His clothing had changed as he passed by an old clothing store on the way, where an elderly lady worked inside.

The old lady didn't ask what happened or his name‚Äîshe just did her business.

Now, while waiting at the bus stop, Jiang Dao could finally clarify his thoughts. When he came here, he was greeted with a problem, so he couldn't even think straight.

Feeling his slightly trembling hands, he finally felt it deeply‚Äîthat he had been reborn in another body. His fair hands were now marked with mud, scratches, and dried blood.

What was that thing?

In his memory, he had never encountered something like that in his whole life.

Searching through his memories‚Äîyeah, not even on TV or in the news was there something like that. Only occasionally would he see it on platforms similar to Reddit, Facebook, or TikTok from his previous life. But he had just scoffed it off as editing scams were rampant even here.

But the experience yesterday and today proved that this world was not what it seemed.

Also, how should he face and explain this to his parents? But after thinking about it, Jiang Dao realized he didn't have to worry too much. His parents weren't rich but also weren't poor, and all the money he used wasn't that much‚Äîhe could still buy two more sets of that equipment with his saved allowance. And his parents fully supported his interests and wouldn't ask him about this. Anyway, as long as his grades were right, nothing would be an issue.

Of course, they had this mentality also because Jiang Dao had a successful older brother working in his business and talented younger sister and brother.

---



In the sky, under the dark clouds and heavy rain, a large bird was slowly flying, then suddenly changed direction as it avoided a specific spot.

*Shriek!*

Under the path it should have taken stood an old abandoned building with mossy walls crumbling around its frame. The rain had turned the moss a sickly green, and water dripped steadily from broken gutters.

It was the building where four people had lost their lives just yesterday.

In the building, a large eerie eye was looking towards the sky where the bird had been‚Äîwatching from the west side window. The eye blinked once, slow and deliberate, before retreating into the darkness beyond the cracked glass.

Then‚Äî

Back in the room he had escaped from, something shifted in the ceiling shadows‚Äîa bulbous shape hanging silently, its face pressed against the rain-washed window, watching the direction Jiang Dao had run. The glass fogged with each of its shallow breaths.

A faint voice, like words spoken through destroyed vocal cords, drifted through the air, blending with the sound of the rain. The whisper seemed to follow the wind, searching...

""Where... are... you...""

...

Back to the bus stop‚Äî

*Beep! Beep!*

Jiang Dao looked up and saw a bus cutting through the rain, its headlights guiding the way forward through the downpour. Like hope cutting through fog.

It stopped with a gentle hiss, and passengers in raincoats or carrying umbrellas stepped down onto the wet pavement.

Two beautiful girls emerged in trench coats, discussing what they had just experienced in soft voices.

""When are we going back to that place?"" one asked.

""Probably around next month. Why?""

""I didn't expect it, but the concert was too good!""

""See? I told you it was! You never believed me in the past, so you missed too many good things."" The other girl shook her head with a proud expression.

Jiang Dao passed by them and climbed inside.

The bus was sparsely populated, with only a few people scattered across the seats. He made his way toward the right corner in the middle, settling beside the window. Looking outside at the rain-soaked streets, he couldn't help but feel a deep sadness as he realized he might never see the people close to him again. He hadn't felt it at first because of the immediate danger, but now, listening to the steady rhythm of rain against the windows, he couldn't help but rub his palms together.

""It's too cold...""

""Then do you want me to keep you warm?""

A playful voice startled him. Looking up, he saw a beautiful girl in a pink puffer jacket, a small luggage bag beside her.

""Kaite?!""

Jiang Dao was surprised‚Äîhe hadn't expected to see his classmate here.

Kaite had been one of his friends at school. They'd been classmates from first year until now, their third year.

Kaite smiled and pointed at the empty seat beside him. ""Can I sit here?""

Although she asked politely, she was already settling in beside him.

Up close, Jiang Dao could clearly smell her natural, comforting scent.

""Why are you here?"" Jiang Dao asked, puzzled, as he made room and moved her bag to the front seat since no one was sitting there.

""I should be the one asking you why you're here,"" Kaite replied while rummaging through her bag.

""Me? I‚Äî""

""Here...""

Jiang Dao's words were interrupted as she handed him a soft blanket.

""You said you were cold, right? Take this blanket. I don't want you to get sick."" Although her words were casual, Jiang Dao could still feel the concern in her voice.

""Hah? No, I was just joking. I'm not cold.""

Jiang Dao declined‚Äîit would be too shameful if his resistance to cold was lower than a girl's.

""Kyle! Don't be stubborn...""

Kaite frowned and moved closer, extending her hand.

""Hey!"" Jiang Dao was surprised and confused about what she was doing, but instinctively he leaned back.

""You're shaking. Either you're cold or you've got a fever ‚Äî and if you collapse, don't expect me to carry your dumb ass.""

Sensing his intention, Kaite's other hand gripped his wrist while she placed her right hand on his forehead, checking his temperature.

""You're cold, see? Don't be stubborn anymore.""

With a gentle voice, Kaite picked up the blanket he had dropped and draped it over him.

Jiang Dao was dumbfounded and stared at her face, especially her warm brown eyes. She had soft facial features with long hair and graceful curves beneath her jacket.

""What are you looking at?""

Tapping his head playfully, Kaite smiled again, returning to her cheerful nature.

""Nothing. I was just surprised."" Jiang Dao straightened his posture and tried to calm down as the bus started moving again.

...

""So why are you here, Kaite? I'm just visiting my grandmother. I heard that she was sick, so I came here to accompany her.""

When asked about this topic, Kaite's tone visibly lowered.

""Ah‚Äî I'm sorry...""

Jiang Dao apologized, knowing that when old people get sick, the outcomes are often grim, and the more likely scenario would be death.

""It's okay..."" ""I don't blame you for asking."" Kaite smiled at his reaction, but she didn't have the playfulness like before.

Sensing that she was in a low mood, Jiang Dao didn't ask anymore and let her self-regulate. As he observed the people in the bus.

A duo on the right side was playing with their phone:
""Look at this, bro.""
""So strong! What's the name of that player?""

A middle-aged man with a calm bearing was tapping away on his laptop in the front.

*Tat! Tat!*

Then he noticed behind them a tall man who kept glancing in their direction. The man would look at his phone, then toward the window, but his eyes would drift back to their seats. When their eyes met briefly, the man quickly looked away, but Jiang Dao could feel the attention returning.

Maybe he was just bored. Maybe he recognized Kaite from somewhere. Maybe he was just one of those people who couldn't help but stare.

But something felt wrong.

The label rang out in his head as Jiang Dao's eyes turned fierce. He had been holding his anger and depression since the start. First, he was killed, enduring overwhelming pain. Then, after he thought he was safe, he was once again greeted by even more horror. He was bullied here and there like a lost dog.

He could only accept it at his worst. He couldn't come back to life and kill the driver if he was still alive, nor could he fight whatever was in the building.

But it would be different with a human... Especially since he still had the knife on him.

""Jiang Dao, what are you looking at?""

""Ah? Nothing.""

""Really?"" Kaite felt doubtful but didn't pursue it.

Looking at the window, Jiang Dao could see in his reflection a murderous face staring back.

But not seconds had passed before his killing intent regressed because he saw...

Outside, far away in the field of grass, a tall figure stood motionless in the rain. Looking at its height, it was hard to believe this was human. It gave off a wrong vibe‚Äîtoo still, too tall, too *aware*. Even from this distance, even through the rain-streaked glass, Jiang Dao could feel it watching.

The bus continued forward, and the figure began to move, keeping pace with them across the field. Not running, not walking‚Äîjust... gliding. Its movements were wrong, unnatural, as if it wasn't bound by the same rules as everything else.

Jiang Dao's blood ran cold as he realized the truth.

It had followed him.

The thing from the building‚Äîit wasn't contained to that cursed place. It was out here, in the world, hunting him.

And suddenly, the suspicious man on the bus seemed like the least of his problems.

And I hope if you happen to see this, you'll take a moment of silence to pray for them. They've been struggling a lot and a prayer for them will surely help them.


Heavenly God, We praise Your omnipotence. We trust Your omnipresence, and we believe in Your loving heart. Grant that our hearts be filled with love, our heads be nurtured with wisdom, and our hands be molded to care as we journey through this life.

Lord, we lift to You all aspiring lawyers preparing for the Bar Examinations this year. You see and you are there through their quiet battles. The long nights, the silent breakdowns and the sacrifices they make to reach this calling. You saw every year that they shed, every cup of coffee that they consume, and every prayer that their hearts is silently whispering. Bless their minds with clarity, their hearts with courage, and their spirits with peace. Strengthen their resolve when doubts creep in. Calm their anxieties when pressure hits. Hold them steady when they feel like giving up and when they feel like they're alone in this battle. Lord, let every reading be fruitful, every review be meaningful, and every effort, no matter how small, be rewarded with grace. Lord may they remember every provisions and jurisprudence that they will read will be remembered well during the bar. 

Lord, we also pray those who are struggling in this journey. Those burdened financially, hurting emotionally, wavering spiritually, and those tired mentally. Lord, meet them where they are. Carry them when they can no longer walk or stand. And remind them that even in silence, You are working.

Provide also for those with limited means. Comfort those who cries alone. Renew the strength of those who feel forgotten. And remind them that this dream is not impossible with You.

And when the  bar exam comes, grant them peace that surpasses all understanding. Let their hands that will type their answers speak with justice, truth, and grace. Surround them with Your presence in every subject, and let Your will be done in their lives.

May they pass, not just for their own triumph, but for the people they are meant to serve. Let this calling be fulfilled, not just by merit, but by Your mercy and divine purpose.

All these we humbly pray, In the mighty name of Jesus, through the intercession of St. Joseph of Cupertino and St. Ives of Kermartin

1m0ezky,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m0ezky/how_tall_is_a_standard_patio_table/,How tall is a standard patio table?,"When I first started looking for patio furniture, I was surprised by how many options there were. One of the biggest questions I had was about table height. After doing some research and shopping around, I learned that standard patio table heights can vary depending on the type and purpose of the table.

Dining tables are usually between 28-30 inches tall. This is a comfortable height for most people to sit and eat at. Bar height tables, also called pub tables, are taller at around 40-42 inches. These work well with bar stools and create a more casual vibe.

For coffee tables or side tables on a patio, you're looking at about 18-20 inches high. These lower tables are perfect for putting drinks or snacks within easy reach while lounging.

The right height really depends on how you plan to use your outdoor space. If you enjoy hosting dinners outside, a standard dining height table makes sense. For a more relaxed hangout spot, mix it up with a bar height table and some lower side tables.

When shopping, it's important to consider the chairs or seating you'll use with the table too. Make sure there's enough clearance between the seat and tabletop for comfortable legroom. About 12 inches is usually good.

I found a great selection of patio tables in different heights at https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables. They have options to suit any outdoor setup, whether you want a dining table, bar table, or accent pieces.

Material is another factor to think about. Wood tables give a classic look but need more maintenance. Metal is durable and low-maintenance. Plastic or resin tables are lightweight and affordable. Glass tops can make a space feel bigger but show water spots easily.

Don't forget about size and shape too. Round tables work well in tight spaces and encourage conversation. Rectangular tables are great for larger groups. Consider how many people you usually entertain and choose accordingly.

Whatever style you go with, outdoor tables should be sturdy and weather-resistant. Look for features like adjustable feet to keep the table level on uneven surfaces.

Setting up your patio with the right table can really transform your outdoor living space. It creates a focal point for gatherings and gives you a spot to enjoy meals or drinks outside.

If you're ready to upgrade your patio, check out the options at https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables. They have a wide range of tables to fit any style or space.

Remember, the standard heights are just guidelines. The most important thing is finding a table that works for your specific needs and complements your outdoor area. Happy patio decorating!",1,1752577980.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1m0exuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m0exuq/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/,I thought my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friends were harmless‚Ä¶ until I met Mr. Long.,"It is currently 12:17 am when I‚Äôm writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I‚Äôm not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare‚Ä¶ this is more disturbing‚Ä¶ this is real. Fuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself‚Ä¶ let me back up a bit.

¬†I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

My name is John‚Ä¶ a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter‚Äôs bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn‚Äôt much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that‚Äôs about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn‚Äôt mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I‚Äôm not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn‚Äôt in the living room watching TV like usual.

‚ÄúEmma.‚Äù I called out, ‚ÄúEmma, honey. Where are you?‚Äù

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she got tired and went to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though it was the middle of winter and the heat was on, it felt like a freezer door had been opened in her room, blowing a cold breeze into the hallway.

As I approached the door, I could see that it was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering‚Ä¶ listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet‚Ä¶ disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn‚Äôt just childish banter‚Ä¶ she was having a legitimate conversation.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you like the sunlight?‚Äù She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs sad.‚Äù

She paused a few seconds longer‚Ä¶ grimacing with discontent.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt tell Daddy.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

‚ÄúEmma, honey? Who are you talking to?‚Äù I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left as quickly as it came. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

‚ÄúMr. Long,‚Äù she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

‚ÄúOh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?‚Äù I asked, trying to rationalize it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?‚Äù

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs too big to fit in there,‚Äù She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn‚Äôt sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere‚Ä¶ so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really tall and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.‚Äù She explained, now smiling again. ‚ÄúHis fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I‚Äôm asleep.‚Äù

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn‚Äôt perceive how disturbing her description was.

‚ÄúHe lives in the wall with his friend. She‚Äôs really nice.‚Äù She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I thought to myself. There can‚Äôt be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter‚Äôs feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl‚Ä¶? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn‚Äôt so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, sweetheart‚Äù line I always used when she told me something I didn‚Äôt understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

‚ÄúAlright, honey, it‚Äôs time to eat,‚Äù I said, pulling her away from the closet door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.‚Äù

She smiled, looking at me.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt eat,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMr. Long just likes to watch.‚Äù

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness‚Ä¶ and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn‚Äôt need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am‚Ä¶ There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy‚Ä¶ not a child‚Äôs voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶not ready yet‚Ä¶‚Äù (static) ‚Äú‚Ä¶soon. Be patient‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice muttered.

‚ÄúBut I want to play now,‚Äù Emma responded quickly. ‚ÄúShe said she wants me to come in.‚Äù

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open‚Ä¶ darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù I whispered, stepping toward the bed. ‚ÄúAre you okay, honey?‚Äù

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

‚ÄúThe girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.‚Äù She said sleepily. ‚ÄúShe wants to come play.‚Äù

Her voice was flat. She wasn‚Äôt scared; she was more‚Ä¶ dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn‚Äôt physically see anything‚Ä¶ but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour‚Ä¶ like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Emma said, sitting straight up in bed‚Ä¶ eyes now wide open and staring at me. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like the door closed.‚Äù

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn‚Äôt make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down and acted like she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with her pulling away from me and groaning in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn‚Äôt say as many as two words to me the entire morning. The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes. I figured it would be perfect for what I wanted to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn‚Äôt see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed‚Äôs comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless‚Ä¶ mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn‚Äôt have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved. As the figure grew to its full length, the camera shook, as if it were pushed or touched by something before going black. Shocked, I paused it and rewound. I watched over and over as the figure slithered from the darkness and stood over Emma, imposing its devious intentions. I wanted it to be a trick of the light or maybe my mind playing tricks on me‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt. Every time I watched it, the same unsettling scene played out.

It wasn‚Äôt my imagination. Something dark and ominous was in the room with her that night. Something that calls itself‚Ä¶ Mr. Long.

What‚Äôs the one game-changing feature it‚Äôs missing?","Three months ago, I launched a small, privacy-first money tracker: no logins, no cloud, no ads. Just a simple app that runs fully offline.  
  
Reddit helped it grow far beyond what I expected:  
\-500,000+ views (across 3 posts)  
\-3,000+ users (iOS + Android)  
\-$630 in revenue  
  
Even more valuable than the numbers: the feedback. People helped debug, translated the app, and suggested features I never would‚Äôve thought of.  
  
Now I‚Äôm at a crossroads.  
  
There‚Äôs traction, but as a solo indie, I need to be intentional. I don‚Äôt want to spend months building the wrong thing.  
  
Here are the most-requested features so far:  
\-Apple Pay sync (without full bank access)  
\-Shared accounts (for couples/roommates)  
\-Home screen widget for quick entry/checking  
\-Desktop/macOS version  
\-Stock & crypto tracking (but that breaks the offline model)  
  
Or totally something else, more creative, someone that can help me to brainstorm? Like different graphs, motivational quotes, voice input, or smart text like '3 on coffee'.  
  
But I don‚Äôt want to guess.   
  
So if you use a finance app, or might, what‚Äôs the ONE feature that would make this truly useful?  
  
This community‚Äôs been a huge help so far for my app [MoneyTool](http://themoneytool.com/download) and honestly.., Reddit feels like my cofounder at this point.  
  
Still bootstrapping and learning as I go.

Is this normal?,"I‚Äôm a man in my 30s from London, UK. I have an amazing friend who I‚Äôve known for nearly ten years now. We used to train together for years nearly daily every evening, go out together for dinners and to bars and with other friends. Chill and randomly meet up etc. travel together. We even worked together. We both worked very intense jobs with long hours but still saw each other quite a bit.

He had a baby a year ago, after unexpectedly getting married which was a shock to many of his friends. But life changes, I guess.

It can be intense with a baby of course, we all understand that. He even reduced his weekend work to spend more time with family. All good things and positive.

However, it has become nearly impossible to meet up even for a quick catch up. I‚Äôve asked numerous times and he will say he‚Äôs busy or overwhelmed atm, then like a month later say I‚Äôll pass by his workplace after work and he will say he‚Äôd rather we plan something. His workplace is an hour from me but I thought let me drop by. So I tell him to let me know what works for him and I‚Äôll be there. Then won‚Äôt hear anything for a few weeks and just message something random like an old pic that popped up on my iPhone. Then he will say maybe we can do a coffee sometime and I again say ok time and place and he won‚Äôt really reply to that.

I‚Äôm genuinely confused, can a person be this busy due to a baby? I‚Äôve had jobs where I worked 18 hour days for months and I still had time for a lunch or coffee. 

I‚Äôm happy for him and wish him only the best but I feel like this is the beginning stage of losing a friend and it makes me sad. Living in London I feel like I‚Äôve lost lots of friends through distance and during Covid etc. 

I‚Äôve realised also that during the last year or so whenever we did meet it was because I initiated it and went to see him. But for the past 3-4 months I‚Äôve tried to meet just to catch up and it‚Äôs just impossible. 

I am a bit confused because I‚Äôve had other friends who have had babies and I didn‚Äôt notice this. And my brother in law has had a baby and he‚Äôs literally living the same as he was before. He works and sees baby but he‚Äôs not impossible to meet.

If y‚Äôall have any advice or input I‚Äôd appreciate it.

**EDIT** - I appreciate that having a baby is stressful and I thank you all for your input but it seems like most of the negative comments projecting are from mothers who are understandably stressed. If there are any fathers here who could share, I‚Äôd appreciate it also. ",0,1752577557.0,beyondthebump,35,0.5,False

For individuals experiencing stomach ulcers, dietary modifications play a crucial role in managing symptoms, promoting healing, and preventing recurrence. While the causes of ulcers are primarily bacterial infection (*H. pylori*) or long-term NSAID use, what you eat can significantly impact your comfort and recovery. The focus is on reducing stomach acid, avoiding irritants, and incorporating foods that support the stomach lining and fight inflammation.

# Foods to Embrace (Evidence-Backed)

1. **Fibre-Rich Foods (Especially Soluble Fibre):**
   * **Why they help:** Fibre can act as a buffer, reducing acid levels in the stomach, aiding digestion, and potentially helping to prevent ulcers. Soluble fiber, in particular, may increase the viscosity of intestinal content, contributing to a gentler digestive process.
   * **Examples:** Oats, oatmeal, apples, pears, bananas, legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas), barley, flax seeds, carrots, sweet potatoes, whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat bread).
   * **Evidence:** Studies, such as a meta-analysis published in the *World Journal of Gastroenterology* (2012), suggest a high-fiber diet decreases the risk of developing ulcer disease, with a stronger association for soluble fiber \[1\]. Another study in the *American Journal of Gastroenterology* (2000) found that increased fiber intake was associated with a reduced risk of duodenal ulcer \[2\].
2. **Lean Proteins:**
   * **Why they help:** Protein is essential for tissue repair and healing, which is critical for ulcer recovery. Lean sources are easier to digest and less likely to stimulate excessive acid production compared to high-fat proteins.
   * **Examples:** Skinless poultry (chicken, turkey), fish (salmon, mackerel - rich in omega-3 fatty acids with anti-inflammatory benefits), tofu, tempeh, eggs, lean beef.
   * **Evidence:** Adequate protein intake is fundamental for cellular regeneration and tissue repair, processes vital for healing any lesion, including ulcers. The body requires amino acids, derived from protein, to rebuild damaged stomach lining \[General Nutritional Science\].
3. **Probiotic-Rich Foods:**
   * **Why they help:** Probiotics introduce beneficial bacteria to the gut, which can help balance the stomach's environment, especially in cases of *H. pylori* infection. They may reduce the bacterial load, speed up healing, and lessen antibiotic side effects when used in conjunction with conventional therapy.
   * **Examples:** Yogurt, kefir, fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso.
   * **Evidence:** Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, for instance, one in *Helicobacter* (2015) and another in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* (2009), have demonstrated that probiotics (especially *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* strains) can suppress *H. pylori* growth, improve eradication rates of *H. pylori* therapy, and mitigate antibiotic-associated side effects \[3, 4\].
4. **Non-Acidic Fruits and Vegetables:**
   * **Why they help:** These provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants without irritating the stomach lining. Many fruits contain flavonoids, which have antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially increasing stomach mucus and inhibiting *H. pylori*.
   * **Examples of Fruits:** Apples, pears, bananas, melons, berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries ‚Äì rich in antioxidants), unripe plantain bananas (for their leucocyanidin content).
   * **Examples of Vegetables:** Leafy greens (spinach, kale), carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (contains sulforaphane, which inhibits *H. pylori*), sweet potatoes.
   * **Evidence:** Flavonoids, widely present in fruits and vegetables, have shown gastroprotective effects in various studies \[5\]. Specifically, sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage has been shown *in vitro* and *in vivo* to inhibit *H. pylori* growth and reduce inflammation associated with gastric ulcers \[6\]. Leucocyanidin from unripe plantains has also been studied for its anti-ulcerogenic properties \[7\].
5. **Healthy Fats (in moderation):**
   * **Why they help:** Essential for overall health and can be less irritating than unhealthy fats.
   * **Examples:** Olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds.
   * **Evidence:** Studies suggest that olive oil, particularly extra virgin olive oil, may have anti-*H. pylori* effects due to its phenolic compounds, as demonstrated *in vitro* \[8\].
6. **Certain Teas and Natural Remedies:**
   * **Why they help:** Can offer soothing effects and possess beneficial compounds.
   * **Examples:** Decaffeinated green tea (flavonoids may inhibit *H. pylori*), chamomile tea (anti-inflammatory and soothing properties), licorice root (DGL form preferred, may protect stomach lining), ginger (anti-inflammatory), honey (antimicrobial, especially Manuka).
   * **Evidence:** Green tea catechins have shown inhibitory effects on *H. pylori* in laboratory settings and some epidemiological studies suggest a reduced risk of gastric cancer (often linked to *H. pylori*) with regular green tea consumption \[9\]. Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) has been shown to enhance the integrity of the gastric and duodenal lining \[10\]. Honey, particularly Manuka honey, has demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against *H. pylori* in *in vitro* studies \[11\]. Ginger is well-known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-nausea properties \[General Herbal Medicine\].

# Foods to Limit or Avoid (Common Irritants)

1. **Spicy Foods:**
   * **Why to limit/avoid:** While not a cause of ulcers, they can irritate the stomach lining and worsen pain and discomfort for many individuals.
   * **Examples:** Chili peppers, hot sauces, black pepper, red pepper, chili powder.
   * **Evidence:** While direct causation of ulcers by spicy food is not established, capsaicin, the active compound in chili peppers, can stimulate acid secretion and cause gastric mucosal irritation, exacerbating symptoms in susceptible individuals \[12\].
2. **Acidic Foods:**
   * **Why to limit/avoid:** Can increase stomach acidity and irritate the ulcer, especially when reflux is also present.
   * **Examples:** Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruit), tomatoes and tomato products (sauce, ketchup), vinegar.
   * **Evidence:** These foods can lower the pH of gastric contents, which can aggravate ulcer pain and heartburn symptoms for some individuals \[General Dietetics\].
3. **Caffeine and Carbonated Beverages:**
   * **Why to limit/avoid:** Caffeine can stimulate stomach acid production, and carbonated drinks can cause gas, bloating, and distension, all of which can increase pressure on the stomach and worsen discomfort.
   * **Examples:** Coffee (both caffeinated and decaffeinated), black tea, soda, energy drinks.
   * **Evidence:** Caffeine is a known stimulant of gastric acid secretion \[13\]. Carbonated beverages contribute to gastric distension, which can also trigger acid reflux \[General Physiology\].
4. **Alcohol:**
   * **Why to limit/avoid:** Alcohol can directly irritate and damage the stomach lining, increasing inflammation, and potentially leading to erosions and bleeding. It can also stimulate acid production.
   * **Evidence:** Alcohol consumption is a well-established risk factor for gastric mucosal injury and can delay ulcer healing \[14\].
5. **Fatty and Fried Foods:**
   * **Why to limit/avoid:** These are harder to digest and can delay gastric emptying, leading to prolonged exposure of the stomach lining to acid, and can also stimulate cholecystokinin (CCK) which can increase acid production in some individuals.
   * **Examples:** Fried chicken, greasy burgers, high-fat processed snacks.
   * **Evidence:** High-fat meals slow down gastric emptying and can exacerbate dyspeptic symptoms, including those associated with ulcers \[General Gastroenterology\].
6. **Mint and Peppermint:**
   * **Why to limit/avoid:** While often seen as soothing, they can relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the muscle that prevents stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus. This can worsen acid reflux, which is often comorbid with ulcer symptoms.
   * **Evidence:** Peppermint is known to relax the LES, which can exacerbate symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) \[15\].
7. **Highly Processed Foods and Added Sugars:**
   * **Why to limit/avoid:** Often low in beneficial nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants. They can also contribute to systemic inflammation and an imbalanced gut microbiome, which is not conducive to healing.
   * **Evidence:** A diet rich in processed foods and refined sugars is generally associated with increased inflammation and poorer gut health, though direct ulcer causation isn't established, it can hinder overall healing \[General Nutrition/Inflammation\].

# General Dietary Guidelines

* **Eat Smaller, More Frequent Meals:** Instead of three large meals, opt for several smaller meals throughout the day. This can help reduce the amount of acid in the stomach at any given time and aid digestion.
* **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help dilute stomach acid and maintain overall hydration.
* **Cooking Methods:** Choose gentle cooking methods like steaming, baking, poaching, or grilling over frying.
* **Listen to Your Body:** Individual tolerance varies. Keep a food journal to identify specific foods that trigger or worsen your symptoms and adjust your diet accordingly.

I was gonna do that thing where i weigh myself for 7 days then divide by 7 but my summer job started, now i still dont know my maintenance and wont know it until my summer job ends, im not gonna weigh myself during the summer job cuz i come home after not eating the entire day and dehydrated, i hate the feeling of a full stomach (as in a stomach with food or water inside) but i still wanna lean bulk obviously, now listen dont call me retarded or something, im just paranoid, I stress over everything I can't eat without counting the grams of everything i eat, yes EVERYTHING. I have to count macros and I hate that this is so stressful

It's so annoying having to for example make a smoothie with EXACTLY 150g yogurt and then the yogurt left on the spoon i used to pick the yogurt up with gets thrown away, yeah the yogurt on the spoon doesnt get licked but gets thrown away to the sink. What im implying is that im not licking the spoon after the yogurt gets on it.

I've heard so many fucking people saying shit like ""eat more healthy fats, eat more calorie dense foods, just eyeball it, just estimate the calories and focus on protein dont count the other macros, drink alot of water to stretch your stomach""
ALL OF THAT, SO MANY PEOPLE SAY ALL OF THAT BUT, I just dont know, im paranoid. Lets take someone random, like for example David laid, he bulks and just estimates, one of his breakfasts was at like 7am, he put oat without measuring, put brown sugar and a spoon of Nutella all of that without measuring, how does he know the calories of that? It was before school which I dont understand. I physically can not eat so early. I just FUCKING HATE THE FEELING OF A FULL STOMACH/STOMACH WITH FOOD OR WATER and I also hate eating early

""Drink more water to stretch your stomach"" BUT IM SCARED. IT FEELS SO UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING ALOT OF WATER OR FOOD IN YOUR STOMACH. EVEN IF YOU KNOW YOU STILL NEED TO EAT MORE

Lets say you eat like 1kg of watermelon, thats like 500kcal or some shit

Your stomach would feel so uncomfortable ain't that right? But guess what, you'd still be undereating.

Do you understand what im saying? Please help me, i need yalls help so fucking bad. Once again I dont eat eat at my summer job, and I dont fucking know what im gonna do about school once it starts. I count the grams of everything, going for perfection


This is literally me

""Uhhh 151g frozen raspberry? NO NO NO, *removes a gram*""

""Uhhh I need to weigh my seasonings"" 

SEASONINGS...
...FUCKING SEASONINGS

EVEN IF ITS PROBABLY A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF CALORIES I GET SCARED. THEN I JUST SAY ""hmmm lets say 17 calories of seasonings"" EVEN THO ITS PROBABLY NEGLIGIBLE. DUDE IM SO STREASED AND ANXIOUS AND PARANOID MY EGO JUST ALWAYS WANTS PERFECTION.

IM SCARED OF HEALTHY FATS, SCARED OF EATING, SCARED OF A FULL STOMACH, FUCKKKK, IM SCARED OF DRINKING TOO MUCH WATER CUZ MY STOMACH WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. I HAVE TO WEIGH EVERYTHING EVEN A SMALL SMALL TEENY TINY 1 CALORIE CUBE OF AN APPLE.

And another example would be at my summer job, my supervisor would be like ""who wants coffee"" and I'd always say no (this is hypothetical) I always say no cuz like my brain would be like ""oh god how many grams of coffee beans will he put? Oh god I cant weigh the coffee, oh god im scared if I drink this coffee I won't know how much calories that is and when I go home and eat ima eat more calories than i need"" even tho at the end I undereat by a shit ton. Im definitely eating under my BMI.

What a pain in the fucking ass, I just wanna know if anyone else was like this, help me please. I feel so weird, this is so mentally painful. Stressful, you get it.

And dont say something like ""talk to a doctor, talk to a therapist"" just help me, thank you. If youre wondering anything ask me and I'll reply and answer you.

Hello Archivists,

Bit of a long shot, but I‚Äôm hoping someone might have a spare ticket going for The Statement Begins live show at The Lowry this Thursday (18th July). I missed out when tickets first dropped and I‚Äôve been kicking myself ever since.

I‚Äôd be happy to pay face value and throw in some refreshments: coffee, beer, or a fear-themed snack of your choosing. Just don‚Äôt ask me to bring worms.

Long-time Magnus fan here, and it‚Äôd mean a lot to experience the event in person. If anyone‚Äôs plans have changed or you know someone with a spare, please feel free to DM me.

Willing to meet anywhere in Manchester before the show or grab the ticket digitally if that‚Äôs easier.

Thanks so much, and if I don‚Äôt manage to make it I hope everyone going has a wonderful time.",1,1752577278.0,TheMagnusArchives,0,1.0,False
1m0errw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m0errw/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/,I thought my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friends were harmless‚Ä¶ until I met Mr. Long.,"It is currently 12:17 am when I‚Äôm writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I‚Äôm not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare‚Ä¶ this is more disturbing‚Ä¶ this is real. Fuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself‚Ä¶ let me back up a bit.

¬†I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

My name is John‚Ä¶ a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter‚Äôs bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn‚Äôt much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that‚Äôs about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn‚Äôt mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I‚Äôm not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn‚Äôt in the living room watching TV like usual.

‚ÄúEmma.‚Äù I called out, ‚ÄúEmma, honey. Where are you?‚Äù

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she got tired and went to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though it was the middle of winter and the heat was on, it felt like a freezer door had been opened in her room, blowing a cold breeze into the hallway.

As I approached the door, I could see that it was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering‚Ä¶ listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet‚Ä¶ disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn‚Äôt just childish banter‚Ä¶ she was having a legitimate conversation.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you like the sunlight?‚Äù She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs sad.‚Äù

She paused a few seconds longer‚Ä¶ grimacing with discontent.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt tell Daddy.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

‚ÄúEmma, honey? Who are you talking to?‚Äù I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left as quickly as it came. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

‚ÄúMr. Long,‚Äù she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

‚ÄúOh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?‚Äù I asked, trying to rationalize it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?‚Äù

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs too big to fit in there,‚Äù She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn‚Äôt sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere‚Ä¶ so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really tall and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.‚Äù She explained, now smiling again. ‚ÄúHis fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I‚Äôm asleep.‚Äù

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn‚Äôt perceive how disturbing her description was.

‚ÄúHe lives in the wall with his friend. She‚Äôs really nice.‚Äù She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I thought to myself. There can‚Äôt be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter‚Äôs feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl‚Ä¶? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn‚Äôt so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, sweetheart‚Äù line I always used when she told me something I didn‚Äôt understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

‚ÄúAlright, honey, it‚Äôs time to eat,‚Äù I said, pulling her away from the closet door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.‚Äù

She smiled, looking at me.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt eat,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMr. Long just likes to watch.‚Äù

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness‚Ä¶ and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn‚Äôt need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am‚Ä¶ There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy‚Ä¶ not a child‚Äôs voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶not ready yet‚Ä¶‚Äù (static) ‚Äú‚Ä¶soon. Be patient‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice muttered.

‚ÄúBut I want to play now,‚Äù Emma responded quickly. ‚ÄúShe said she wants me to come in.‚Äù

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open‚Ä¶ darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù I whispered, stepping toward the bed. ‚ÄúAre you okay, honey?‚Äù

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

‚ÄúThe girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.‚Äù She said sleepily. ‚ÄúShe wants to come play.‚Äù

Her voice was flat. She wasn‚Äôt scared; she was more‚Ä¶ dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn‚Äôt physically see anything‚Ä¶ but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour‚Ä¶ like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Emma said, sitting straight up in bed‚Ä¶ eyes now wide open and staring at me. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like the door closed.‚Äù

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn‚Äôt make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down and acted like she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with her pulling away from me and groaning in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn‚Äôt say as many as two words to me the entire morning. The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes. I figured it would be perfect for what I wanted to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn‚Äôt see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed‚Äôs comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless‚Ä¶ mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn‚Äôt have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved. As the figure grew to its full length, the camera shook, as if it were pushed or touched by something before going black. Shocked, I paused it and rewound. I watched over and over as the figure slithered from the darkness and stood over Emma, imposing its devious intentions. I wanted it to be a trick of the light or maybe my mind playing tricks on me‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt. Every time I watched it, the same unsettling scene played out.

It wasn‚Äôt my imagination. Something dark and ominous was in the room with her that night. Something that calls itself‚Ä¶ Mr. Long.

1m0erjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1m0erjq/on_road_trips_driving_through_the_night_is_better/,"On Road Trips, Driving Through The Night Is Better & Safer","I often drive back and forth between two cities that are about an 11 hour drive apart. I now always make the drive throught the night, leaving at about 8pm and arriving at 7am. It's so much safer and more enjoyable because:

-Other drivers are the biggest hazard. But at night there are very few. Often I am the only car on the road.

-Because there is no heavy traffic or construction, the trip takes less time and leas fuel, and you don't have morons pulling stunts to weave through heavy traffic

-Its easy on the eyes compared to the bright sun. High beams works really well to see far in front, and on a divided & separated highway you don't see much light from the odd oncoming driver. (Yes I make sure to dim the light when drivers ahead or oncoming). You get to enjoy the silence and beautiful stars.

-You arrive a day early (sorfof). I mean if you get off work friday evening you can get there saturday morning and take a small nap, then still have an extra day there.

-Most gas stations are open 24/7.

Of course I get that lots of people aren't good at staying awake through the night, but I personally have no problems drinking coffee and playing music and staying up all night even at 33.

I was gonna do that thing where i weigh myself for 7 days then divide by 7 but my summer job started, now i still dont know my maintenance and wont know it until my summer job ends, im not gonna weigh myself during the summer job cuz i come home after not eating the entire day and dehydrated, i hate the feeling of a full stomach (as in a stomach with food or water inside) but i still wanna lean bulk obviously, now listen dont call me retarded or something, im just paranoid, I stress over everything I can't eat without counting the grams of everything i eat, yes EVERYTHING. I have to count macros and I hate that this is so stressful

It's so annoying having to for example make a smoothie with EXACTLY 150g yogurt and then the yogurt left on the spoon i used to pick the yogurt up with gets thrown away, yeah the yogurt on the spoon doesnt get licked but gets thrown away to the sink. What im implying is that im not licking the spoon after the yogurt gets on it.

I've heard so many fucking people saying shit like ""eat more healthy fats, eat more calorie dense foods, just eyeball it, just estimate the calories and focus on protein dont count the other macros, drink alot of water to stretch your stomach""
ALL OF THAT, SO MANY PEOPLE SAY ALL OF THAT BUT, I just dont know, im paranoid. Lets take someone random, like for example David laid, he bulks and just estimates, one of his breakfasts was at like 7am, he put oat without measuring, put brown sugar and a spoon of Nutella all of that without measuring, how does he know the calories of that? It was before school which I dont understand. I physically can not eat so early. I just FUCKING HATE THE FEELING OF A FULL STOMACH/STOMACH WITH FOOD OR WATER and I also hate eating early

""Drink more water to stretch your stomach"" BUT IM SCARED. IT FEELS SO UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING ALOT OF WATER OR FOOD IN YOUR STOMACH. EVEN IF YOU KNOW YOU STILL NEED TO EAT MORE

Lets say you eat like 1kg of watermelon, thats like 500kcal or some shit

Your stomach would feel so uncomfortable ain't that right? But guess what, you'd still be undereating.

Do you understand what im saying? Please help me, i need yalls help so fucking bad. Once again I dont eat eat at my summer job, and I dont fucking know what im gonna do about school once it starts. I count the grams of everything, going for perfection


This is literally me

""Uhhh 151g frozen raspberry? NO NO NO, *removes a gram*""

""Uhhh I need to weigh my seasonings"" 

SEASONINGS...
...FUCKING SEASONINGS

EVEN IF ITS PROBABLY A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF CALORIES I GET SCARED. THEN I JUST SAY ""hmmm lets say 17 calories of seasonings"" EVEN THO ITS PROBABLY NEGLIGIBLE. DUDE IM SO STREASED AND ANXIOUS AND PARANOID MY EGO JUST ALWAYS WANTS PERFECTION.

IM SCARED OF HEALTHY FATS, SCARED OF EATING, SCARED OF A FULL STOMACH, FUCKKKK, IM SCARED OF DRINKING TOO MUCH WATER CUZ MY STOMACH WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. I HAVE TO WEIGH EVERYTHING EVEN A SMALL SMALL TEENY TINY 1 CALORIE CUBE OF AN APPLE.

And another example would be at my summer job, my supervisor would be like ""who wants coffee"" and I'd always say no (this is hypothetical) I always say no cuz like my brain would be like ""oh god how many grams of coffee beans will he put? Oh god I cant weigh the coffee, oh god im scared if I drink this coffee I won't know how much calories that is and when I go home and eat ima eat more calories than i need"" even tho at the end I undereat by a shit ton. Im definitely eating under my BMI.

What a pain in the fucking ass, I just wanna know if anyone else was like this, help me please. I feel so weird, this is so mentally painful. Stressful, you get it.

And dont say something like ""talk to a doctor, talk to a therapist"" just help me, thank you. If youre wondering anything ask me and I'll reply and answer you.

1m0epc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1m0epc4/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/,I thought my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friends were harmless‚Ä¶ until I met Mr. Long.,"It is currently 12:17 am when I‚Äôm writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I‚Äôm not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare‚Ä¶ this is more disturbing‚Ä¶ this is real. Fuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself‚Ä¶ let me back up a bit.

¬†I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

My name is John‚Ä¶ a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter‚Äôs bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn‚Äôt much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that‚Äôs about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn‚Äôt mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I‚Äôm not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn‚Äôt in the living room watching TV like usual.

‚ÄúEmma.‚Äù I called out, ‚ÄúEmma, honey. Where are you?‚Äù

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she got tired and went to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though it was the middle of winter and the heat was on, it felt like a freezer door had been opened in her room, blowing a cold breeze into the hallway.

As I approached the door, I could see that it was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering‚Ä¶ listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet‚Ä¶ disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn‚Äôt just childish banter‚Ä¶ she was having a legitimate conversation.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you like the sunlight?‚Äù She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs sad.‚Äù

She paused a few seconds longer‚Ä¶ grimacing with discontent.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt tell Daddy.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

‚ÄúEmma, honey? Who are you talking to?‚Äù I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left as quickly as it came. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

‚ÄúMr. Long,‚Äù she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

‚ÄúOh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?‚Äù I asked, trying to rationalize it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?‚Äù

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs too big to fit in there,‚Äù She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn‚Äôt sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere‚Ä¶ so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really tall and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.‚Äù She explained, now smiling again. ‚ÄúHis fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I‚Äôm asleep.‚Äù

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn‚Äôt perceive how disturbing her description was.

‚ÄúHe lives in the wall with his friend. She‚Äôs really nice.‚Äù She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I thought to myself. There can‚Äôt be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter‚Äôs feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl‚Ä¶? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn‚Äôt so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, sweetheart‚Äù line I always used when she told me something I didn‚Äôt understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

‚ÄúAlright, honey, it‚Äôs time to eat,‚Äù I said, pulling her away from the closet door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.‚Äù

She smiled, looking at me.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt eat,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMr. Long just likes to watch.‚Äù

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness‚Ä¶ and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn‚Äôt need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am‚Ä¶ There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy‚Ä¶ not a child‚Äôs voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶not ready yet‚Ä¶‚Äù (static) ‚Äú‚Ä¶soon. Be patient‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice muttered.

‚ÄúBut I want to play now,‚Äù Emma responded quickly. ‚ÄúShe said she wants me to come in.‚Äù

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open‚Ä¶ darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù I whispered, stepping toward the bed. ‚ÄúAre you okay, honey?‚Äù

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

‚ÄúThe girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.‚Äù She said sleepily. ‚ÄúShe wants to come play.‚Äù

Her voice was flat. She wasn‚Äôt scared; she was more‚Ä¶ dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn‚Äôt physically see anything‚Ä¶ but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour‚Ä¶ like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Emma said, sitting straight up in bed‚Ä¶ eyes now wide open and staring at me. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like the door closed.‚Äù

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn‚Äôt make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down and acted like she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with her pulling away from me and groaning in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn‚Äôt say as many as two words to me the entire morning. The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes. I figured it would be perfect for what I wanted to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn‚Äôt see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed‚Äôs comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless‚Ä¶ mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn‚Äôt have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved. As the figure grew to its full length, the camera shook, as if it were pushed or touched by something before going black. Shocked, I paused it and rewound. I watched over and over as the figure slithered from the darkness and stood over Emma, imposing its devious intentions. I wanted it to be a trick of the light or maybe my mind playing tricks on me‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt. Every time I watched it, the same unsettling scene played out.

It wasn‚Äôt my imagination. Something dark and ominous was in the room with her that night. Something that calls itself‚Ä¶ Mr. Long.

We also agreed to share certain consumable household goods in half unless specified otherwise for the past 6 months. Surprisingly, when they first moved in they did not bring any consumable household goods with them. When I asked what happened to their current supply they said they were just gonna leave it at their Airbnb to expense it out. So basically they were assuming they could just use our current supply without contributing any of their own. I was annoyed but thought it wasn‚Äôt worth bringing up since it was family, whatever.

We are now 6 months in and even though we share these household goods it is always my SO and I who purchases, replenishes and stores the household goods. I have told them  they are welcome to do the same but they agreed but never followed through.

So as of a few days ago I suggested that perhaps we should not share consumable household goods anymore. It would be fairer to everyone and if someone is out of coffee filter than it was on them to replenish it.

That‚Äôs when I got this text message that‚Äôs attached.

Am I just delusional or is the suggestion of splitting the cost of electricity based on usage per person impractical? The picture they attached is also based just off of the previous months cost and in my area prices fluctuate heavily based on the time and season. They also both WFH whereas my SO and I don‚Äôt.

My sister said it is a burden for them to not share consumable household goods. And that at the end of the day the cost evens out. But is it now becoming a burden for them because they never had to think about it before because they never had to handle it?

My sister also asked why I can‚Äôt be generous like sister B because she never charges her utilities or cost of food. Which is strange because they were never roommates. If anything my sister would house sit, baby sit, or puppy sit for sister B as a favor. If anything sister B should be paying her.

Looking for genuine advice because I honestly didn‚Äôt think asking to not share consumable housegoods would lead to this situation üòî",4,1752576943.0,mildlyinfuriating,17,0.7,False

Should I still send one last message?,"I (M 34) dated someone (F 32) back in 2021‚Äì2022. It was an intense relationship, but I wasn‚Äôt emotionally available at the time due to unresolved stuff from my past and just not being fully aware of myself. She wanted a relationship and loved me, but I kept holding her at a distance. Eventually she broke it off, going completely no contact and blocking me on almost every channel. It was very painful and difficult for her, but she managed to do it eventually.

Since then, I had other relationships, but none came close to what I felt with her. The problem: I only realized this way too late, and I regret it. And to be honest, I wish I could be with her again, or at least, I want her to know how I feel.

I tried reaching out twice last year; once briefly (just an invitation for coffee, not really saying what I needed to say), and once more elaborate (but I suspect that message was never delivered). I never got a reply to either of them.

So here‚Äôs the point: I‚Äôm thinking of sending her one last message. Especially because I‚Äôm not sure if the last message actually reached her. But I‚Äôm afraid I come across as obsessive, weird, or disrespectful.

1m0emae,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m0emae/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/,I thought my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friends were harmless‚Ä¶ until I met Mr. Long.,"It is currently 12:17 am when I‚Äôm writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I‚Äôm not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare‚Ä¶ this is more disturbing‚Ä¶ this is real. Fuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself‚Ä¶ let me back up a bit.

¬†I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

My name is John‚Ä¶ a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter‚Äôs bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn‚Äôt much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that‚Äôs about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn‚Äôt mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I‚Äôm not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn‚Äôt in the living room watching TV like usual.

‚ÄúEmma.‚Äù I called out, ‚ÄúEmma, honey. Where are you?‚Äù

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she got tired and went to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though it was the middle of winter and the heat was on, it felt like a freezer door had been opened in her room, blowing a cold breeze into the hallway.

As I approached the door, I could see that it was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering‚Ä¶ listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet‚Ä¶ disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn‚Äôt just childish banter‚Ä¶ she was having a legitimate conversation.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you like the sunlight?‚Äù She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs sad.‚Äù

She paused a few seconds longer‚Ä¶ grimacing with discontent.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt tell Daddy.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

‚ÄúEmma, honey? Who are you talking to?‚Äù I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left as quickly as it came. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

‚ÄúMr. Long,‚Äù she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

‚ÄúOh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?‚Äù I asked, trying to rationalize it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?‚Äù

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs too big to fit in there,‚Äù She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn‚Äôt sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere‚Ä¶ so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really tall and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.‚Äù She explained, now smiling again. ‚ÄúHis fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I‚Äôm asleep.‚Äù

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn‚Äôt perceive how disturbing her description was.

‚ÄúHe lives in the wall with his friend. She‚Äôs really nice.‚Äù She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I thought to myself. There can‚Äôt be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter‚Äôs feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl‚Ä¶? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn‚Äôt so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, sweetheart‚Äù line I always used when she told me something I didn‚Äôt understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

‚ÄúAlright, honey, it‚Äôs time to eat,‚Äù I said, pulling her away from the closet door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.‚Äù

She smiled, looking at me.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt eat,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMr. Long just likes to watch.‚Äù

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness‚Ä¶ and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn‚Äôt need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am‚Ä¶ There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy‚Ä¶ not a child‚Äôs voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶not ready yet‚Ä¶‚Äù (static) ‚Äú‚Ä¶soon. Be patient‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice muttered.

‚ÄúBut I want to play now,‚Äù Emma responded quickly. ‚ÄúShe said she wants me to come in.‚Äù

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open‚Ä¶ darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù I whispered, stepping toward the bed. ‚ÄúAre you okay, honey?‚Äù

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

‚ÄúThe girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.‚Äù She said sleepily. ‚ÄúShe wants to come play.‚Äù

Her voice was flat. She wasn‚Äôt scared; she was more‚Ä¶ dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn‚Äôt physically see anything‚Ä¶ but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour‚Ä¶ like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Emma said, sitting straight up in bed‚Ä¶ eyes now wide open and staring at me. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like the door closed.‚Äù

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn‚Äôt make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down and acted like she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with her pulling away from me and groaning in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn‚Äôt say as many as two words to me the entire morning. The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes. I figured it would be perfect for what I wanted to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn‚Äôt see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed‚Äôs comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless‚Ä¶ mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn‚Äôt have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved. As the figure grew to its full length, the camera shook, as if it were pushed or touched by something before going black. Shocked, I paused it and rewound. I watched over and over as the figure slithered from the darkness and stood over Emma, imposing its devious intentions. I wanted it to be a trick of the light or maybe my mind playing tricks on me‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt. Every time I watched it, the same unsettling scene played out.

It wasn‚Äôt my imagination. Something dark and ominous was in the room with her that night. Something that calls itself‚Ä¶ Mr. Long.

my first day in this place (temporary shelter thing while i get my shit together for an apartment) i meet another dood. i assumed he was just a ""weird tumblr girl"" until he mentioned it and still feel terrible. every gigapoon box you can tick applies here.

after knowing me for a grand total of 10 minutes he confesses that he likes me. i'm quite retarded and don't know how to gently reject people, so i just say ""ok thanks"" and continue talking to some other üåà folx üåà

my second day he shows me a bunch of unfunny tiktoks until i realize i really am too retarded for this shit. i don't even have a tiktok. every time i see him he's endlessly scrolling. i go outside to smoke, have coffee. he follows and sits next to me shortly after, apparently he's allergic to tobacco so i put mine out.

for the next half hour or so he proceeds to (loudly) fight with his mom on the phone, to the point where other people in the courtyard get up and peace out, or enter the courtyard and immediately go back inside

i want to as well, but he starts crying and intermittently trauma dumping his childhood onto me and one other poor bastard i'm chill with. i sit there collecting swamp ass. all i want to do is finish off my cigs and chill until i can check in to my motel room, but i'm here giving generic ""just work on yourself"" advice

i'm not attracted to this person at all, physically, personality-wise, mentally. tragic shit. sure i can be his friend, since he seems like he really needs one. but can you really be true friends with someone who confesses to you 10 minutes after learning of your existence?",10,1752576762.0,4tran4,7,1.0,False

1m0ekes,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyYumYum/comments/1m0ekes/what_is_parenting_what_does_it_mean_to_be_a_parent/,What Is Parenting? What Does It Mean to Be a Parent?,"# Parenting is one of the most profound journeys a person can embark on. It‚Äôs not a job, a task, or a title you clock in and out of - it‚Äôs a relationship. And it‚Äôs a relationship that shapes another human being. When we ask ‚ÄúWhat is parenting?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to be a parent?‚Äù, we‚Äôre digging into something far deeper than nappy changes, bedtime routines, or school drop-offs. We‚Äôre talking about unconditional love, growth (both yours and theirs) and the everyday choices that influence how a child sees the world and themselves.

The definition of parenting has expanded significantly in recent decades. It used to be fairly black and white: you provided food, shelter, discipline and education, and you were considered a good parent. Today, it‚Äôs not so simple. Society is more aware than ever of the emotional, menta and developmental needs of children. We understand that parenting isn‚Äôt just about survival ‚Äì it‚Äôs about helping children thrive emotionally, mentally and socially.

Parenting now includes conversations about screen time, mental health, digital safety, emotional literacy and inclusivity. And with that expansion has come both empowerment and pressure. Parents today are expected to do more, be more, know more. But here‚Äôs the truth: there‚Äôs no one perfect way to parent. What matters most is the connection you build with your child.

# The Emotional Weight of Parenting

One of the most unexpected parts of becoming a parent is how much it changes you. You feel love more intensely than you ever thought possible, so big it can make your chest ache. But alongside that love come feelings of fear, guilt, anxiety and doubt.

You worry whether you‚Äôre doing enough. You second-guess decisions. You compare yourself to other parents on social media, even though you know deep down that it‚Äôs not a fair comparison. You might feel overwhelmed by the sheer constancy of it all because parenting doesn‚Äôt stop, even when you‚Äôre tired, sick, or emotionally drained.

Still, within all of that mess and chaos is joy. Real joy. It‚Äôs in your baby‚Äôs giggle. It‚Äôs in your toddler‚Äôs proud ‚ÄúLook what I made!‚Äù It‚Äôs in your teen confiding in you after a hard day. And it‚Äôs in the ordinary moments too, like holding hands on a walk or sharing popcorn on the couch.

# Being a Parent Means More Than Just Biology

You don‚Äôt have to give birth to be a parent. Adoptive parents, foster parents, step-parents, grandparents, guardians ‚Äì anyone who loves, nurtures and raises a child is fulfilling the role of a parent. What matters is showing up. It‚Äôs about consistency, connection and care.

Real parenting happens in the day-to-day choices. Sitting beside them at bedtime. Encouraging them when they‚Äôre scared. Holding space for their big feelings. Teaching them about respect ‚Äì not just with lectures, but by modelling it in your own relationships. Being a parent is about guiding a child not just through childhood, but into adulthood and being there for the messy in-between.

# The Role of Boundaries and Discipline

Discipline isn‚Äôt about punishment; it‚Äôs about teaching. It‚Äôs helping your child learn to navigate the world safely and respectfully. Boundaries give kids a sense of structure and structure makes them feel secure. When you say ‚Äúno‚Äù or enforce a consequence, it might not feel good in the moment but you‚Äôre helping them understand limits and accountability.

Effective parenting isn‚Äôt about control, it‚Äôs about connection. Children are more likely to listen and respect boundaries when they feel loved, understood and safe. That‚Äôs why many modern parents are turning to gentle or authoritative parenting styles approaches that blend empathy with clear boundaries.

# What Children Really Need

They don‚Äôt need perfection. They don‚Äôt need a parent who always has the right answers. What they need is love ‚Äì consistent, patient and present love. They need someone who sees them, listens to them and believes in them. They need routines that give their day structure, space to explore their interests and support when they fail or feel afraid.

It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in buying the best toys or providing every extracurricular opportunity. But the truth is, children remember how you made them feel. Did you smile when they walked into the room? Did you put your phone down when they were talking? Did you apologise when you got it wrong?

These small moments build a foundation of trust and self-worth.

# The Everyday Reality of Parenting

Parenting is rarely glamorous. It‚Äôs sleep-deprived nights, repeated conversations, reheated coffee and school runs in the rain. It‚Äôs sitting in waiting rooms, refereeing sibling squabbles and negotiating over broccoli. But it‚Äôs also magic. It‚Äôs the sticky kisses, the proud smiles, the milestones no one else even notices.

And then, there‚Äôs the growth. Not just your child‚Äôs but yours too. You become more patient. More intuitive. You learn what matters and what doesn‚Äôt. You let go of the version of parenting you imagined and embrace the version you‚Äôre living ‚Äì messy, imperfect, but real.

# Letting Go of the Pressure to Be Perfect

Social media paints a picture of parenting that‚Äôs often filtered and curated. You see colour-coded lunchboxes and picture-perfect nurseries and it‚Äôs easy to feel like you‚Äôre falling short. But perfection isn‚Äôt the goal.

Parenting is full of mistakes. You will raise your voice when you didn‚Äôt mean to. You‚Äôll forget appointments. You‚Äôll sometimes wish for a break. That doesn‚Äôt make you a bad parent. It makes you human. And showing your child that it‚Äôs okay to be human is one of the most powerful lessons you can give.

# Every Parent‚Äôs Journey Is Unique

No two parenting journeys look the same. Some parents are solo. Some co-parent across two households. Some rely on extended family. Some have one child, others many. Some parents face extra challenges, raising children with disabilities, navigating poverty, or managing mental health.

Comparing your path to others only steals your peace. Instead, focus on your child, your values, your connection. You are the expert on your child and your love and commitment matter more than any external measure.

# Final Thoughts

To parent is to invest in the future, every single day. It‚Äôs showing up when it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs wiping tears, sharing laughter, holding space for big emotions and cheering from the sidelines. It‚Äôs shaping another human being and being shaped in return.

You might not always get it right. But if you‚Äôre trying, if you‚Äôre loving, if you‚Äôre learning, you‚Äôre already doing an incredible job. Because parenting isn‚Äôt about perfection. It‚Äôs about presence, growth and love.



# FAQs

# What if I don‚Äôt feel naturally maternal or paternal?

That‚Äôs completely normal. Parenting isn‚Äôt a personality trait, it‚Äôs a skill you build over time. Love grows with connection.

# Can I be a good parent if I didn‚Äôt have good role models growing up?

Yes. Your awareness of what you missed can guide you to do better. Breaking cycles is hard but powerful.

# Is it okay to make mistakes as a parent?

Absolutely. Mistakes are inevitable. What matters is how you repair, apologise and learn from them.

# How do I deal with judgment from others about my parenting choices?

Trust your instincts and your child‚Äôs needs. Other people don‚Äôt live your life. You don‚Äôt owe them explanations.

# What if I feel burnt out and overwhelmed by parenting?

Reach out. You‚Äôre not alone and you deserve support. Taking care of yourself is part of being a good parent.

1m0ek2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1m0ek2q/how_to_break_cycles/,How to break cycles,"This is going to be long. Basically I have repetitive experiences that happen randomly throughout my life. Im not sure if it‚Äôs a cursed or what. Im not sure what it is. I‚Äôve journaled about it, ive talked about it and at this point im turning to reddit. 

Lets start with this
When I was a child. A man tried to lure me to him.  My fight or flight response kicked in and I ran away to safety.
Years later (was still a child) I was standing outside a movie theater waiting for my ride. I was standing far away from the movie theater doors. This man gets out of his car, he has a look on his face and is approaching me. Fight or flight kicked in. I ran into the movie theaters. He followed me in there. I talked to the staff. What did he do when he followed me in there you might wonder? He looked at the posters on the wall. Didnt see a movie. Didnt go to the bathroom. Looked at the posters on the wall. I waited inside for my ride.
Years later. Im in highschool. Im in the woods at the end of my street. Alone of course. Im minding my own business and a man yells at me. I ran (of course) not sayin he had ill intentions but he was wearing camo and people shouldnt hunt that close to houses but they do.
Years later as an adult. I was at my favorite park. I get out of my car. A man in the parking lot with a big trench coat and hat, was smoking a cigarette, drinking a coffee and staring at me. That alarmed me but i was going the opposite way of him. Im exploring the park. I seen him walk past and stare at me. Eventually i leave that area. I walk past him sitting on a bench. As soon as i passed he got up. Luckily there were photographers there further down the path and i SWEAR they were my angels. One of them walked me safely to my car. 
Just the other day. I was on a walk with my friend. We were walking back to her house from the ice cream place we went to. We were walking on the left side (towards traffic cuz thats what ur supposed to do) and this car slowed down going past us. Then. He turned to the left down a street. But he stopped at the stop sign staring at us with his window rolled down. He then turned around. I told my friend we need to walk on the grass hill (in front of an apartment type complex). He was going slow past us. He kept going past us but eventually just stopped. I thought maybe be was gonna pull into the back parking lot of the old streetsboro shopping center. But no. He stopped before it. There were cars coming behind him and he just sat there

I have so much trauma from this. Especially from the first time when i was a kid. Nightmares went on for years until i started smoking ‚Äúflower‚Äù in highschool. I cant feel safe alone. I feel as ive gotten older its gotten worse. 

Now some different examples

A year or 2 after I got my first car. A black man hit my car. 
Why does color matter you might ask?
Years later. Another black man hit my car.
Years later. Another black man hit my new car (except it was with a uboat at a storage unit)

Why does this keep happening to me? Why is it always a black man and why do my cars keep getting hit? The color of the person doesnt matter to me. Its just weird that its 3 TIMES! Lol

More examples

I always find hair in my food. It happens every where i go. No specific place. It isnt every time i eat but its always me. I even bought packed cookies last week (yes i believe they were made there) and bit into it just to have a hair in it. This isnt the first time i had a cookie with hair inside of it this year. Over and over again i have hair in my food. Throughout my wholeee life ive had countless amounts of times with hair inside my food. I can name several hair in my food stories throughout my life.

Why does this keep happening to me? 
(I dont want a poor hygiene explanation because like i said. Its always me finding hair in my food. It doesnt matter where im at. Families houses, restaurants etc.)

More examples

Ive been bullied at my last 3 jobs by grown women. 


Also may i mention. Every so years i have memories in my snapchat that unintentionally align with what im doing literally years later. For example. I watch the same movie the same day years later. (I know this because of my snapchat memories). Ill be at the same places doing almost the same thing, the same day years later. Its really trippy to me. Those at least arent bad experiences. 

Why is this happening to me? Am i cursed? Am i manifesting these to happen because of the paranoia it has caused? Howwwwwww do i break these cycles? Why is it always me? No one else i know has cycles like these? I feel like ive learned enough and lived through enough of these for this to end alreadyüò©

1m0ejx4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0ejx4,AIO: Roomie wants to split utilities based on usage and doesn‚Äôt want to pay if on vacation,"TLDR: roomies want to split utilities based off usage per person. They also don‚Äôt want to pay for utilities during the times they‚Äôre on vacation.

For context these roommates are my sister and brother-in-law. My SO and I have been sharing a house with them along with 1 other roommate for a total of 5 people in the house. We had been splitting utilities 5 ways each month which is what agreed to when they moved in. We also agreed to share certain consumable household goods in half unless specified otherwise for the past 6 months. Surprisingly, when they first moved in they did not bring any consumable household goods with them. When I asked what happened to their current supply they said they were just gonna leave it at their Airbnb to expense it out. So basically they were assuming they could just use our current supply without contributing any of their own. I was annoyed but thought it wasn‚Äôt worth bringing up since it was family, whatever.

We are now 6 months in and even though we share these household goods it is always my SO and I who purchases, replenishes and stores the household goods. I have told them  they are welcome to do the same but they agreed but never followed through.

So as of a few days ago I suggested that perhaps we should not share consumable household goods anymore. It would be fairer to everyone and if someone is out of coffee filter than it was on them to replenish it.

That‚Äôs when I got this text message that‚Äôs attached.

Am I just delusional or is the suggestion of splitting the cost of electricity based on usage per person impractical? The picture they attached is also based just off of the previous months cost and in my area prices fluctuate heavily based on the time and season. They also both WFH whereas my SO and I don‚Äôt.

My sister said it is a burden for them to not share consumable household goods. And that at the end of the day the cost evens out. But is it now becoming a burden for them because they never had to think about it before because they never had to handle it?

My sister also asked why I can‚Äôt be generous like sister B because she never charges her utilities or cost of food. Which is strange because they were never roommates. If anything my sister would house sit, baby sit, or puppy sit for sister B as a favor. If anything sister B should be paying her.

After lots of trials and errors, and a few awkward gifts üôÉ, I started looking for ways to simplify the whole process and take the stress out of finding the right gift.

Now, when I need to pick something up for someone, I usually do one of these:

\- **Ask about their current interests**: People‚Äôs hobbies change! A quick chat or even a scroll through their social media can give you clues about new passions or needs.  
\- **Go for experiences over stuff**: Subscriptions, classes, or tickets to an event in their city are often more memorable than a physical gift.  
\- **Gift cards with a twist**: Pair a gift card with a small, thoughtful item like a coffee shop card with a cool mug, or a meal kit subscription with a fun kitchen gadget.  
\- **Use AI for tailored recommendations:** When in doubt, there's always AI-powered tools that suggest gifts based on the person‚Äôs interests, occasion and so on: [GiftEasy](https://gift-easy.com/), [Genie](https://giftlist.com/genie), [Outdone](https://www.outdone.io/), it asks a few questions about the recipient and gives you tailored suggestions. Works all the time ‚ò∫Ô∏è.  
\- **Keep a running list**: Whenever someone mentions something they like or want, right it down on your phone. When the time comes, you‚Äôll have some ideas to start with.

There‚Äôs a lot more you can do to make gift giving easier, but these are the tips I personally use. The goal: never stress over gift ideas again and actually enjoy the process.",1,1752576442.0,Gifts,0,1.0,False
1m0einb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m0einb/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/,I thought my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friends were harmless‚Ä¶ until I met Mr. Long.,"It is currently 12:17 am when I‚Äôm writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I‚Äôm not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare‚Ä¶ this is more disturbing‚Ä¶ this is real. Fuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself‚Ä¶ let me back up a bit.

¬†I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

My name is John‚Ä¶ a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter‚Äôs bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn‚Äôt much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that‚Äôs about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn‚Äôt mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I‚Äôm not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn‚Äôt in the living room watching TV like usual.

‚ÄúEmma.‚Äù I called out, ‚ÄúEmma, honey. Where are you?‚Äù

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she got tired and went to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though it was the middle of winter and the heat was on, it felt like a freezer door had been opened in her room, blowing a cold breeze into the hallway.

As I approached the door, I could see that it was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering‚Ä¶ listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet‚Ä¶ disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn‚Äôt just childish banter‚Ä¶ she was having a legitimate conversation.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you like the sunlight?‚Äù She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs sad.‚Äù

She paused a few seconds longer‚Ä¶ grimacing with discontent.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt tell Daddy.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

‚ÄúEmma, honey? Who are you talking to?‚Äù I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left as quickly as it came. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

‚ÄúMr. Long,‚Äù she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

‚ÄúOh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?‚Äù I asked, trying to rationalize it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?‚Äù

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs too big to fit in there,‚Äù She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn‚Äôt sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere‚Ä¶ so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really tall and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.‚Äù She explained, now smiling again. ‚ÄúHis fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I‚Äôm asleep.‚Äù

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn‚Äôt perceive how disturbing her description was.

‚ÄúHe lives in the wall with his friend. She‚Äôs really nice.‚Äù She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I thought to myself. There can‚Äôt be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter‚Äôs feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl‚Ä¶? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn‚Äôt so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, sweetheart‚Äù line I always used when she told me something I didn‚Äôt understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

‚ÄúAlright, honey, it‚Äôs time to eat,‚Äù I said, pulling her away from the closet door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.‚Äù

She smiled, looking at me.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt eat,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMr. Long just likes to watch.‚Äù

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness‚Ä¶ and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn‚Äôt need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am‚Ä¶ There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy‚Ä¶ not a child‚Äôs voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶not ready yet‚Ä¶‚Äù (static) ‚Äú‚Ä¶soon. Be patient‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice muttered.

‚ÄúBut I want to play now,‚Äù Emma responded quickly. ‚ÄúShe said she wants me to come in.‚Äù

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open‚Ä¶ darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù I whispered, stepping toward the bed. ‚ÄúAre you okay, honey?‚Äù

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

‚ÄúThe girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.‚Äù She said sleepily. ‚ÄúShe wants to come play.‚Äù

Her voice was flat. She wasn‚Äôt scared; she was more‚Ä¶ dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn‚Äôt physically see anything‚Ä¶ but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour‚Ä¶ like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Emma said, sitting straight up in bed‚Ä¶ eyes now wide open and staring at me. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like the door closed.‚Äù

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn‚Äôt make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down and acted like she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with her pulling away from me and groaning in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn‚Äôt say as many as two words to me the entire morning. The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes. I figured it would be perfect for what I wanted to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn‚Äôt see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed‚Äôs comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless‚Ä¶ mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn‚Äôt have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved. As the figure grew to its full length, the camera shook, as if it were pushed or touched by something before going black. Shocked, I paused it and rewound. I watched over and over as the figure slithered from the darkness and stood over Emma, imposing its devious intentions. I wanted it to be a trick of the light or maybe my mind playing tricks on me‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt. Every time I watched it, the same unsettling scene played out.

It wasn‚Äôt my imagination. Something dark and ominous was in the room with her that night. Something that calls itself‚Ä¶ Mr. Long.

Ratings:**4.5/5**


Cosmoss have been a card with rising attention since his rencent buff. He was often taken as a 1-drop in heal decks to synergize with the *Venus Flytraplanet* environment, but with Cosmoss's buffing stats increased, he began to find his place in aggro decks. The solar class itself don't really have a cheap environment, so Cosmoss is often seen playing with *Coffee Grounds* and *Hot Lava*.    
Generally, playing multiple environments in the early game could almost make him invincible and reach 8 or 10 attack, making him very difficult to deal with. However, the reason he is not a 5/5 is that in real battles, card draws might be inconsistent, and plant environments are just overall worse than zombie environments. Nevertheless he is a nice addition in decks with environments, along with a high expectation.

1m0ehvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0ehvi,Roommate doesn‚Äôt want to pay utilities when they‚Äôre on vacation and wants to split the cost based on usage,"TLDR: roomies want to split utilities based off usage per person. They also don‚Äôt want to pay for utilities during the times they‚Äôre on vacation.  

For context these roommates are my sister and brother-in-law. My SO and I have been sharing a house with them along with 1 other roommate for a total of 5 people in the house. We had been splitting utilities 5 ways each month which is what agreed to when they moved in. We also agreed to share certain consumable household goods in half unless specified otherwise for the past 6 months. Surprisingly, when they first moved in they did not bring any consumable household goods with them. When I asked what happened to their current supply they said they were just gonna leave it at their Airbnb to expense it out. So basically they were assuming they could just use our current supply without contributing any of their own. I was annoyed but thought it wasn‚Äôt worth bringing up since it was family, whatever. 

We are now 6 months in and even though we share these household goods it is always my SO and I who purchases, replenishes and stores the household goods. I have told them  they are welcome to do the same but they agreed but never followed through. 

So as of a few days ago I suggested that perhaps we should not share consumable household goods anymore. It would be fairer to everyone and if someone is out of coffee filter than it was on them to replenish it. 

That‚Äôs when I got this text message that‚Äôs attached. 

Am I just delusional or is the suggestion of splitting the cost of electricity based on usage per person impractical? The picture they attached is also based just off of the previous months cost and in my area prices fluctuate heavily based on the time and season. They also both WFH whereas my SO and I don‚Äôt.

My sister said it is a burden for them to not share consumable household goods. And that at the end of the day the cost evens out. But is it now becoming a burden for them because they never had to think about it before because they never had to handle it? 

My sister also asked why I can‚Äôt be generous like sister B because she never charges her utilities or cost of food. Which is strange because they were never roommates. If anything my sister would house sit, baby sit, or puppy sit for sister B as a favor. If anything sister B should be paying her. 

Looking for genuine advice because I honestly didn‚Äôt think asking to not share consumable housegoods would lead to this situation üòî ",25,1752576357.0,badroommates,79,0.91,False

This morning, about 30 mins after I woke up, I started getting my telltale migraine signs (aura in one eye which slowly progressed to tunnel vision). As soon as I noticed the aura, I made myself a triple shot coffee with syrup and chugged it, shut the curtains, and got a headache cap/eye mask on. Thankfully I had no plans for today so I got thinking and thought, mainly because I‚Äôd never tried it with migraines, to smoke a little bit of weed and see if it helped (I am a regular smoker). Had the tiniest amount and nibbled a little bit of an edible. I also had some paracetamol and toast around this time. 

I did start to feel the migraine, typical stabbing pain behind my eyes, and thought all the remedies had failed so I just accepted fate. But when it got to the point where I would usually be suffering the worst pain, which would then lead to nausea and me throwing up 9 times out of 10, I actually felt the headache dissipating. An hour and a half has passed since the initial onset of the headache and it‚Äôs now completely gone. 

I honestly think it could have been the edible kicking in‚Äî my logic was that cannabis causes vasodilation which occurs with migraines as well, and that it would somehow counteract it. I dunno if that actually played a role or if its just the painkilling properties but I feel normal now which is huge, I‚Äôve never had a migraine pass so quickly. 

Sorry for the long post but wanted to know if anyone else has used a similar method/give a suggestion to other sufferers!",4,1752576116.0,migraine,6,0.83,False

1m0ec6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TCHILL_OUT/comments/1m0ec6v/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/,I thought my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friends were harmless‚Ä¶ until I met Mr. Long.,"It is currently 12:17 am when I‚Äôm writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter‚Äôs imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I‚Äôm not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare‚Ä¶ this is more disturbing‚Ä¶ this is real. Fuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself‚Ä¶ let me back up a bit.

¬†I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

My name is John‚Ä¶ a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter‚Äôs bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn‚Äôt much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that‚Äôs about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening‚Ä¶ or at least that‚Äôs when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn‚Äôt mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I‚Äôm not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn‚Äôt in the living room watching TV like usual.

‚ÄúEmma.‚Äù I called out, ‚ÄúEmma, honey. Where are you?‚Äù

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she got tired and went to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though it was the middle of winter and the heat was on, it felt like a freezer door had been opened in her room, blowing a cold breeze into the hallway.

As I approached the door, I could see that it was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering‚Ä¶ listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet‚Ä¶ disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn‚Äôt just childish banter‚Ä¶ she was having a legitimate conversation.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you like the sunlight?‚Äù She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs sad.‚Äù

She paused a few seconds longer‚Ä¶ grimacing with discontent.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt tell Daddy.‚Äù

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

‚ÄúEmma, honey? Who are you talking to?‚Äù I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left as quickly as it came. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

‚ÄúMr. Long,‚Äù she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

‚ÄúOh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?‚Äù I asked, trying to rationalize it. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?‚Äù

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs too big to fit in there,‚Äù She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn‚Äôt sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere‚Ä¶ so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really tall and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.‚Äù She explained, now smiling again. ‚ÄúHis fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I‚Äôm asleep.‚Äù

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn‚Äôt perceive how disturbing her description was.

‚ÄúHe lives in the wall with his friend. She‚Äôs really nice.‚Äù She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I thought to myself. There can‚Äôt be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter‚Äôs feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl‚Ä¶? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn‚Äôt so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, sweetheart‚Äù line I always used when she told me something I didn‚Äôt understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

‚ÄúAlright, honey, it‚Äôs time to eat,‚Äù I said, pulling her away from the closet door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.‚Äù

She smiled, looking at me.

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt eat,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMr. Long just likes to watch.‚Äù

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness‚Ä¶ and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn‚Äôt need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am‚Ä¶ There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn‚Äôt hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy‚Ä¶ not a child‚Äôs voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶not ready yet‚Ä¶‚Äù (static) ‚Äú‚Ä¶soon. Be patient‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice muttered.

‚ÄúBut I want to play now,‚Äù Emma responded quickly. ‚ÄúShe said she wants me to come in.‚Äù

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open‚Ä¶ darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù I whispered, stepping toward the bed. ‚ÄúAre you okay, honey?‚Äù

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

‚ÄúThe girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.‚Äù She said sleepily. ‚ÄúShe wants to come play.‚Äù

Her voice was flat. She wasn‚Äôt scared; she was more‚Ä¶ dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn‚Äôt physically see anything‚Ä¶ but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour‚Ä¶ like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Emma said, sitting straight up in bed‚Ä¶ eyes now wide open and staring at me. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt like the door closed.‚Äù

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn‚Äôt make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down and acted like she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with her pulling away from me and groaning in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn‚Äôt say as many as two words to me the entire morning. The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes. I figured it would be perfect for what I wanted to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn‚Äôt see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed‚Äôs comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless‚Ä¶ mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn‚Äôt have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved. As the figure grew to its full length, the camera shook, as if it were pushed or touched by something before going black. Shocked, I paused it and rewound. I watched over and over as the figure slithered from the darkness and stood over Emma, imposing its devious intentions. I wanted it to be a trick of the light or maybe my mind playing tricks on me‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt. Every time I watched it, the same unsettling scene played out.

It wasn‚Äôt my imagination. Something dark and ominous was in the room with her that night. Something that calls itself‚Ä¶ Mr. Long.

‚ÄúFix this.‚Äù  
‚ÄúSee me.‚Äù  
‚ÄúNoted.‚Äù

At first, I thought I‚Äôd done something wrong. All the time. Every little silence felt like judgment. I‚Äôd overanalyze every meeting, every one-word reply. Meanwhile, everyone else in the office seemed to get smiles and small talk. I got nods.

I kept my head down. I worked late. I double-checked everything. Still, Dan didn‚Äôt say much. No ‚Äúgood job,‚Äù no feedback, just tasks.

Then, last month, my mom was hospitalized. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I was showing up to work, trying to hold it together, living off vending machine coffee and hospital cafeteria sandwiches. One day, I was five minutes late to a morning call. Dan looked at me and said, ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

It caught me off guard.

I said yeah. He stared for a second and said, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt look like it.‚Äù That was it. The meeting moved on.

Later that afternoon, I got a calendar invite from him just 15 minutes. I figured I was about to get a warning or maybe a talk about professionalism.

I joined the call, and he just said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been off. You‚Äôre allowed to be. If you need time, take it. If you need help, ask.‚Äù

I just sat there blinking.

Turns out, Dan isn‚Äôt warm. But he *notices.* He told me he‚Äôd seen my workload go up because I was taking on other people‚Äôs slack. He‚Äôd seen me covering shifts. He knew I hadn‚Äôt taken PTO in months.

And then he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not invisible. Just letting you know.‚Äù

I honestly almost cried on the call.

Since then, he hasn‚Äôt changed much. Still short emails. Still dry tone. But now he says ‚Äúthanks‚Äù at the end sometimes. And once in a while, ‚ÄúNice work.‚Äù

And weirdly? That‚Äôs enough.

Moral of the story?

Not every quiet person is ignoring you. Some of them are paying more attention than you think.  
And Dan? You‚Äôre the MVP of Floor 6.",11,1752575728.0,story,0,1.0,False

1m0e9xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1m0e9xo/after_2_weeks_of_binging_voyager_i_had_done_it/,"After 2 weeks of binging Voyager, I had done it!!!","You know what?

**Voyager is so good.**

No ‚Äî I mean that. I *really* mean that. I didn‚Äôt expect to love it this much. I was bracing for another ‚Äútechnobabble of the week‚Äù sci-fi romp, but Voyager‚Ä¶? Voyager gave me a **crew**. It gave me a **home**.

I liked *The Next Generation*. I *loved* *Lower Decks*. I laughed, I cried, I knew Boimler was me. But then my **Uncle**, this absolute **massive nerd** ‚Äî bless his Vulcan-loving heart ‚Äî gave me the golden list: ""Skip this. Watch this. Optional. Must-watch."" The Holy Grail of viewing orders. And I fell in.

And from there? Oh, I was *hooked*. That main arc ‚Äî just get home. That‚Äôs all they want. It‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs primal, it‚Äôs everything. They're not explorers. They‚Äôre not diplomats. They're **lost**. And that made it real.

Early seasons? Good! Strong, solid Trek. But then ‚Äî the **Borg arrive. Seven of Nine steps off that cube ‚Äî and the series hits warp 9 and never slows down**.

Then Naomi shows up. Then the Borg kids. **I loved the Borg kids.** Icheb especially ‚Äî I mean, come on, he became **Seven‚Äôs somewhat adopted son**, her *student*, her anchor to humanity. And **Even Neelix** ‚Äî who I *could not stand* for two straight seasons ‚Äî suddenly becomes this beacon of hope, this awkward uncle who just *wants them all to make it*. I cried ‚Äî CRIED ‚Äî when he left the ship. Just‚Ä¶ walked away. Before the finale.

And Kes. I had a crush. You did too. Don‚Äôt lie. **Jennifer Lien**? Brilliant. That gentle, luminous weirdness? She *belonged* in that sickbay. And when she was gone, the whole place felt... emptier.

Then Jeri Ryan walked in.

*Oh.* Ohhh boy.

Look. I did *not* expect to have another TV crush at my age, but when Seven walks in, draped in drama and nanoprobes and **zero tolerance for inefficiency** ‚Äî yes, yes, and *YES*. She‚Äôs gorgeous now, she was gorgeous then, and she‚Äôs also deeply wounded, and trying. And I fell, again.

But then ‚Äî then you get this last-minute **Seven/Chakotay thing**? What?! *No!* *No, no, no!* You do *not* just glue two amazing characters together **two episodes before the finish line** and call that romance! I am ‚Äî listen ‚Äî I am TEAM CHAKOTAY AND JANEWAY. In *every* timeline, except the one we *got*. There is a universe out there ‚Äî some *Mirror Universe*, some *Q-altered paradox timeline* ‚Äî where **those two made it work**. I will die on this hill.

AND THEN THE FINALE HAPPENS ‚Äî **WHAT THE HELL!?**

**WTFFFF??**
That‚Äôs how you END IT!? **A WORMHOLE? A TENSE STANDOFF? A LITTLE BLINK AND BOOM ‚Äî EARTH?!?** THAT‚ÄôS ALL?! You gave me **seven seasons** of tears, growth, and longing, and I don‚Äôt even get a *hug* on Earth?! Not even a *coffee* on the pier?!?

**WHAT HAPPENED AFTER!?**

Did Seven and Chakotay actually date ‚Äî or was that just emotional cosplay?
Did Naomi become a captain? Did she ever see the Borg kids again?
**Did Harry finally hook up with Jenny Delaney?! HE DESERVED IT!!**
What‚Äôs Miral Paris‚Äôs *weapon of choice*?! Is it a *bat‚Äôleth*, is it a *phaser guitar*, I NEED TO KNOW.
**DID. THE. DOCTOR. FINALLY. CHOOSE. A NAME.**

But *then* then I get to *Picard* and I see what they did to **Icheb**.

**ARE YOU KIDDING ME.**
That sweet boy ‚Äî that gifted, compassionate, ex-Borg child who just wanted to *help* ‚Äî gets ONE SCENE, and it‚Äôs a horror movie autopsy??? You don't even give him a goodbye! You don‚Äôt even give him a *moment*! He wasn‚Äôt just some side character ‚Äî he was **family** to Seven. He was her *kid*. And you *ripped him apart* and threw him away just to give her an origin story for trauma she already had??

I watched **Picard first**, before Voyager. And NOW I KNOW.
Now I know **what we lost**, and it is a goddamn crime.

**Why. Did. They. Do. That. To. Icheb.**

Also‚Ä¶ are the books canon?

**No.**

They‚Äôre not.

But they‚Äôre all we have. All *I* Have.

And I will defend them with my life.

Now I hate Netflix for cancelling Prodigy **GIVE ME MORE** **CHAKOTEY AND JANEWAY**",20,1752575573.0,startrek,15,0.8,False

1m0e7gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverexplainedEmotions/comments/1m0e7gt/happy_envy_analysis_a_social_media_trigger_study/,Happy Envy Analysis: A Social Media Trigger Study,"Attempting a rigorous analysis of the momentary spikes of comparative social jealousy, which seem to coincide with my periodic engagement in the review of others' curated representations on social media platforms (specifically Instagram and Facebook). Upon a precise post-hoc micro-analysis, I've identified that these transient emotional responses are frequently initiated by the curated depiction of individuals' vacations, particularly those in exotic tropical settings with pristine blue waters. 

The initial environmental trigger appears to be a high-quality, selectively filtered image of a distant acquaintance engaging in leisure activities. This provokes an internal comparative appraisal, categorized into a complex cognitive emotional calculus resulting in a hedonic equilibrium disturbance. During this appraisal, key neurotransmitters (hypothetically implicated here are dopamine and serotonin ) might show a fluctuation as a direct response to perceived discrepancies in lifestyle quality, although I lack the equipment to measure these fluctuations, sadly.

The physiological escalation pathway typically follows a temporal sequence, whereby the ocular reception of the primary trigger catalyzes an internal alarm system. This activates a comparative cognitive circuit, leading to psychological discomfort, colloquially recognized as FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). My heart rate experiences a quantifiable uptick, likely attributable to sympathetic nervous system activation, although further empirical research with wearable tech would confirm this hypothesis.

In an attempt to map this response, I've noted variability contingent upon external modifiers, including but not limited to: partaking in suboptimal daily coffee, lack of sufficient pet interaction (specifically with my cat), and ambient atmosphere incongruencies like excessive indoor lighting. 

It's a curious phenomena, this emotionally-governed seesaw, navigating between vicarious thrill and self-comparison blues... and honestly, kinda exhausting to dissect! Yet, such scientific deconstruction, albeit humorous, may lead to a more stable emotional ecosystem in my journey through digital social spaces.",12,1752575334.0,OverexplainedEmotions,2,1.0,False

Organizar una reuni√≥n de trabajo, un taller o un peque√±o congreso en Madrid puede parecer complicado si no encuentras el lugar adecuado. La clave est√° en reservar un espacio que combine comodidad, tecnolog√≠a y una ubicaci√≥n estrat√©gica. Al hacerlo, lograr√°s que tus invitados se sientan bienvenidos desde el primer instante y conc√©ntren toda su energ√≠a en el contenido, en lugar de en detalles log√≠sticos.

A la hora de planificar, merece la pena apostar por la flexibilidad. Un espacio di√°fano y modular se adapta a presentaciones din√°micas, debates en grupo o sesiones de networking. Adem√°s, contar con equipamiento audiovisual de calidad‚Äîpantalla, proyector o sistema de sonido‚Äîevita sobrecostes de √∫ltima hora y te asegura un desarrollo fluido. Por otro lado, disponer de conexi√≥n estable a Internet y de puntos de carga para dispositivos electr√≥nicos refuerza la profesionalidad del encuentro.

La accesibilidad es otro punto esencial. Elegir una zona bien comunicada con varias l√≠neas de metro, autob√∫s y cercan√≠as facilita la llegada de participantes que vengan de distintos puntos de la ciudad. Si algunos asisten en coche, valorar la proximidad de aparcamientos o parkings de tarifas reducidas contribuye a su comodidad. Precisamente por estas ventajas, cada vez m√°s empresas recurren al servicio de¬†[alquiler de salas en Madrid](https://ibercenter.com/servicios/alquiler-salas/), que agrupa varias ofertas con informaci√≥n detallada sobre transportes y facilidades de acceso.

El ambiente juega un papel decisivo en la experiencia global. Una sala luminosa, con luz natural y reguladores de intensidad, mejora la concentraci√≥n y el √°nimo de los asistentes. Del mismo modo, una climatizaci√≥n eficiente y silenciosa evita distracciones y mantiene la temperatura agradable durante toda la jornada. Si el encuentro se prolonga varias horas, disponer de una zona de descanso o un espacio anexo para pausas informales favorece la relajaci√≥n y el intercambio de ideas.

El trato y la atenci√≥n del personal tambi√©n marcan la diferencia. Un equipo dispuesto a ayudarte antes, durante y despu√©s del evento ofrece la tranquilidad de que cualquier incidencia se resolver√° con rapidez. Desde la recepci√≥n de los participantes hasta la coordinaci√≥n del catering‚Äîya sea un coffee break, un tentempi√© saludable o un almuerzo ligero‚Äî, un buen servicio integral te libera de preocupaciones y te permite centrarte en el contenido.

En cuanto al presupuesto, resulta √∫til comparar tarifas por horas, medias jornadas o jornadas completas. Muchas empresas ofrecen descuentos por reservar con antelaci√≥n o por contratar varios espacios a la vez. Adem√°s, leer detenidamente las pol√≠ticas de cancelaci√≥n y las condiciones de modificaci√≥n de fechas evita costes inesperados si tus planes cambian. Para una gesti√≥n a√∫n m√°s √°gil, algunas plataformas especializadas facilitan la reserva online y el pago seguro.

Por √∫ltimo, antes de cerrar el acuerdo, dedica unos minutos a leer rese√±as de usuarios y, si es posible, visita la sala en persona. Ver de primera mano el estado de los interiores, la limpieza y la se√±alizaci√≥n de salidas de emergencia garantiza que todo est√© a punto. De este modo, podr√°s contratar tu¬†[alquiler de salas en Madrid](https://ibercenter.com/servicios/alquiler-salas/)¬†con total confianza y disfrutar de un evento profesional, c√≥modo y memorable.",1,1752575331.0,u_digitalvar_Es,0,1.0,False

The app is 100% free, and I‚Äôm looking for coffee lovers or curious testers who can break things and give honest feedback on the user experience.



Would love to know:

* What‚Äôs confusing or broken?

1m0e61s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPropertyChat/comments/1m0e61s/syd_how_bad_is_buying_in_a_concrete_jungle/,(Syd) How bad is buying in a concrete jungle / apartment in a block with many units?,"I'm trying to buy smaller old brick walk ups in Sydney as first place, around $650k. There is some available, but many times I go there and there is water issues, plumbing, not well kept, intense smells from food etc. Prices are also higher since I guess everyone hears they are good.

Not saying there is none available but I guess in my head I have this ""I should neverrr touch an apartment thats >15 units and built after 2010s"". And I'm wondering whether thats just my own bias or that really is something to be wary of.

There is some well priced places where strata might be $300 higher PQ but it looks nice and ultimately walking distance to shops/cafes/etc. I'm originally regional and love Syd city (lol my dream was to work in an office job and buying a coffee on my way to work and going through those spinny doors llike I saw on TV, its now my nightmare but I digress). 

One example: I see in one major suburb an apartment at $620K brick walk up with cracks all over, shared laundry leaking taps, dirty/messy. Compared to one thats $660K strata is say $400 higher but pretty/new/elevator/clean.

Guess I'm wondering if I really should be ignoring them like I am, or worth giving them a shot and its not as bad I think? ",8,1752575193.0,AusPropertyChat,16,1.0,False
