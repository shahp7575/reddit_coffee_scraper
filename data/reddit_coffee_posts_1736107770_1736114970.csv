1huimt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1huimt7/i_officially_resent_my_n_mother_for_her_bad/,I officially resent my N mother for her bad attitude towards my grandma’s dementia and leaving all of the care responsibilities to myself and my partner,"Somewhere between 7-10 years ago, we started having our suspicions that’s my maternal grandmother was starting with dementia. We lost my grandfather in 2017 to a short battle with cancer and we think the grief definitely sped up the deterioration.

As my grandma was on her own, I’d visit her multiple times a week after work where we’d have a coffee and a chat for a couple of hours. But over time, as to be expected, she started struggling with cognitive decline and her everyday needs were requiring more assistance. 

For years I begged my mum to help me care for my grandma, her own mother, and was constantly just met with constant excuses, starting from “I don’t like it when her neighbour visits and I see him sat in my dad’s chair,” “she embarrasses me in public,” “I can’t take her to hospital appointments because she never gives me the money for taxis,” “if something happened to me in public your grandma wouldn’t be able to help.” 

I’ve got over 30 pathetic excuses written down in my phone from over the years that she’s said to me as to why she can’t help with even basic care needs of my grandma.

Coming up to three years ago now, my grandma had a serious accident at home where she’d severely burnt herself, didn’t tell anybody for three days and she couldn’t tell us how she’d done it. I had to take her to the hospital every two days for dressings changing with mum basically asking how it happened but not giving any other care in the world. But after that accident, me and my partner realised she couldn’t live by herself anymore and we made the decision to move in with her.

Over these three years, we have continued to see her decline and needing more full time care. I’ve continued to beg mum for help just so we can have a break, and instead have just had “well I can’t stay all the time, I’ve got cats to feed at home.” “I might have an appointment,” etc.

Instead, she gave me some numbers to call our local adult social care team to enquire about respite. And when I then argue she doesn’t help us, she’s adamant she stayed up all night to find me those phone numbers and I’m ungrateful.

Christmas 2023, we went out for a meal where myself and my partner were so exhausted from everything, we were yawning our heads off all day. Mum nattered and nattered that she’d look after our 9 month old son so we could have a sleep. But when I asked her if she’d take my grandma in for a few hours so we could visit my in laws, it was “ermmm…no I just want to be on my own.” Followed by arguments of her claiming she was “too overwhelmed” to look after her.

My mum’s behaviour throughout last year has been disgusting, and all she does is cause trouble for my partner instead. Baring in mind my partner now spends most of her days looking after our son, my grandma, changing my grandma’s nappies, showering her, cooking, cleaning, doing laundry etc. whilst mum lives a few streets away and has visited Twice this year. Just to cause trouble. 

I saw mum on Christmas Eve, where I complained about the lack of care and help again and how much we’re struggling, where her response was “*well you wanted to move in.*”

I’ve stirred on that comment all over Christmas. And this weekend we’ve suffered the worst weekend and overall experience with my grandma’s dementia yet. Where she got up at 2am Saturday morning, got dressed, had her breakfast and was seriously confused. Followed by her bowel incontinence today and hours of cleanup. And it’s just hit me so hard how much I fucking resent my mother and her attitude. ",1,1736114486.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1huiliu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1huiliu/sleeping_in_on_weekends/,Sleeping in on weekends ,"To preface I wake up at 5:30 Monday through Friday for work. I love my job and I love being busy all day at work.

I’m just about 35. No kids stay at home wife who literally does all of the housework so that on the weekends I can do whatever I want. 

Lately I’ve been running out of things to do. I fall asleep around 10 and I sleep in from anywhere till noon to 230 on Saturday and Sunday. 

It’s hard to wake up knowing I have nothing to do for the day so I just lay in bed and drift in and out of sleep and dreams until I get too depressed knowing it’s 2 PM and I haven’t done anything with my day. 

I don’t know what happened, I used to wake up at 9 or 11 latest get coffee and go for a hike or walk around the beach or pier but at this time those things are just boring to me now because I’ve done them so much.

My wife loves to sleep in as well. She gets up at two or three sometimes on the weekends. 

But for me, this is getting to me and my question is where do you guys find the motivation to get up on the weekends? If you don’t have kids to take care of, or all of your to-do lists are caught up? ",1,1736114407.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1huilio,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1huilio/dr_lucky_short_story/,Dr. Lucky - Short Story,"This one wrote itself -- have had big Pharma and the whole new year/new you idea on my mind. Would love any feedback -- especially, if I need to explain what is going on (I have a feeling I know -- but, there is some benefit for the reader to be left thinking, right?). Thank you in advance!

Dr. Lucky

Prudence was five minutes late to her doctor’s appointment. It was Saturday morning, and she hadn’t wanted to go to the doctor anyway – and she didn’t want to leave her house. She wasn’t a fan of doctors, and didn’t like appointments. But, her prescription for her thyroid medication would not be filled, the nurse had told her, unless she came in for a yearly physical (it had been two years, but they were not going to be lenient any longer). Prudence knew she needed it; her brain fog was coming back, and she was getting forgetful. She felt sluggish, and her clothes weren’t really fitting. Thyroid, menopause – whatever it was. It sucked. But, so is life, she thought, as she walked to her car. Her moment of reflection was jarred by the incessant barking of the neighbor’s dog, Kip. Kip liked to yip, they said home. Kip barked constantly, and was always outside. She knew her neighbors were at home, but she imagined they had soundproof glass – so Kip stayed outside for the world to hear, while they got respite in their home.

Also, Prudence had been up late last night at “book club.” Air quotes intentional – they did talk about books, for about 15 minutes. Usually, right before they dispersed for the night. Most of the evening was spent lamenting the day to day of a bunch of middle aged ladies. While there were always laughs, and always some good gossip, these evenings didn’t make Prudence as recharged as they used to. Instead, she began to fret about what they would do to her sleep cycle, and how she’d tackle her ever growing to-do list the next morning. 

Prudence made her way to the clinic, and checked in with Tera, the receptionist. She noticed Tera looked different – thinner maybe? Tan? She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but she quickly made her way to an exam room – the benefits of being a bit late. The nurse began her usual line of questioning, took her blood pressure, and then checked her current prescriptions. 

“This will just be a prick,” she said, looking up, smiling, as she took a quick blood sample from Prudence’s finger. 

Next was the doctor. Dr. Lucky was the best doctor in town, of which there were many. He was a good listener, patient, and just a good guy. 

When Prudence’s middle son, Tony, was struggling two years ago with anxiety, he developed a nervous tic; it became a verbal one, and Prudence would watch in horror as he appeared to talk in tongues at times. His actions became reckless, and he’d try to touch the hot stove or run into the street. Prudence brought him to Dr. Lucky in tears, and he calmly reassured both of them. He offered a variety of treatments – therapy, medicine, wait and see. In the end, Tony, began taking some medication and within three days, all the issues were gone. It was like a miracle.

One of her friend’s son’s had been diagnosed with an advanced case of MS. It was a shock, and it was tragic really. Dr. Lucky researched a salve he could use, and after using it for a few months, Shane made a really drastic recovery. No one could explain it, but no one cared. He was saved. 

“I hope you’re not going to ask for ozempic,” he said as he listened to her breathing. 

“Of course not,” Prudence laughed.

“Or an antidepressant. Asking for adderall? That’s the new one. That or hormone therapy. Hormone therapy isn’t really even a thing – that and vitamin cycling”

“Nope – I am perfectly content with being slightly overweight and slightly depressed. I think that is what is normal.”

“You’re just too reasonable, Prudence. I should’ve known better,” he said smiling. 

They talked about her children, his children, busy schedules, too. Everyone was doing fine. Everything was fine. Work was work, and home was busy. The middle age mantra.

“You’re all set. I’ll see you back in a year – for real this time. Don’t make my nurse keep hounding you, okay?”

“I know, I know. I just get busy, and I just don’t really feel like coming each year. I have an apple a day, I am fine with aches and pains. There are so many things – with work, with the kids. Around the house. Things suck – but that’s life. It’s not a highlight reel, you know? But, I will try. I will make the appointment before I leave so I can held to it. I don’t cancel things that are on my calendar.”

“If you do really want to avoid things like this, I do have another option. It is something new. My pharm rep just brought it last week. She says it is completely harmless, has remarkable results, and should be completely approved and vetted within the next 6 months,” he said, not looking away from his computer as he completed Prudence’s chart.

Prudence paused. Where was this coming from, she thought. They had just been discussing the normal aspect of growing older and growing less enthusiastic. Embracing the suck. She had been declared reasonable, for Christsake. 

“No thank you,” she said. “I’m good. Well, fine. You know.”

“Well, if you change your mind, call the nurse. Since I just saw you, it would be easy to set it up. Only thing is, since it’s not totally approved, you wouldn’t pick it up at the pharmacy. I have it here. So, you know, you’d have to come in, but I’d just leave at the desk with Tera,” he said, finally looking at her and smiling. 

“Just stay reasonable. No one likes someone who doesn’t do as they’re told,” he said, as he walked out.

What an odd statement, Prudence thought. He had never spoken to her that way. Maybe she hadn’t noticed it before, but Prudence thought Dr. Lucky’s eyes seemed different, as he said this. She had never paid attention to his eyes before, so maybe they were always that unusual shade of gray, almost silver. Maybe it was the lights. Prudence shook the thought from her mind.

They exchanged their goodbyes, and Prudence left the room, setting her appointment for the next year as she passed by the receptionist’s desk. 

“So, are you going to take it?” Tera asked as she handed her the prescription card. 

“Take what?”

“Oh, didn’t he mention it? The new meds we got. I started this week, and let me  tell you. Everything doesn’t suck anymore! Isn’t that amazing? Like, I feel better, lost ten pounds. I don’t yell at my husband, I don’t mind making lunches or doing laundry. Everything is just easy. And, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel good.” Tera looked up expectantly. 

“Yeah, medicine isn’t really my thing. And, you know I don’t like doctor visits. I’m good.”

\*\*\*

Prudence quickly walked out to her car. She ran a few errands. There were groceries to pick up, a quick trip to the post office. She got a text indicating her prescription was ready, so she headed to the pharmacy. As she waited in line, she thought about the conversations she had had. It was just so strange.  

When it was her turn, the pharmacist let her know her prescription was out of stock.

“This has been happening a lot, unfortunately. Good news though; we checked with Dr. Lucky, and he has a substitute you can use until we get more inventory. It’s the exact same as the thyroid medicine you were taking before, but it just looks a bit different and has a different name. He did say take two today – right away, though, because you haven’t been taking it for a while. We put you on autofill, too. I know things get crazy,” she smiled. 

“Well, thank you for taking care of all that. And, will do,” Prudence replied, sticking the bottle in her purse. 

“Hey, they did that to me, too,” an older man standing behind her said. “And, I love it. Best change. My arthritis is gone!” he said smiling.

“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Prudence said. “But, I don’t have arthritis.”

“Don’t matter. It just makes everything better.”

She got to her car, and took two of the small, gray pills, as she had been instructed. Though she had never taken two pills before, aside when she probably overdosed herself if she forgot she took it, she did as she was told. She trusted Dr. Lucky, even if he and Tera were a bit off today. Plus, she had to do something about this crabbiness and shortness she was feeling. Prudence didn’t like feeling this way, but she knew it was normal. Washing it down with some water, she made two more quick stops, and headed home, mentally planning out the rest of the day, which included chores, practice, food prep, and catching up on some work. 

As Prudence pulled into her driveway, she noticed something strange: Kip, usually a blur of energy, sat perfectly still in their yard, staring at her car. Its eyes seemed off—dull and glassy, like it wasn’t entirely there. Shrugging it off, she hurried into the house, the sense of unease lifting as she busied herself with unpacking groceries, starting laundry, and getting lunch fixed for the boys..

Her phone buzzed. It was a text from an unknown number:**“Change your mind yet?”**

Prudence frowned and blocked the number. It had to be some kind of sales spam.

Another text. This one from the book club girls:

**“My head is killing me. Haven’t left bed. Who’s going to do all my laundry today?”**

Not me, thought Prudence. Embrace the suck, she typed back, and got a few “haha’s” – they were all in the same boat.

\*\*\*

That night, as she lay in bed, she dreamed of Dr. Lucky. In the dream, he wasn’t in his office but standing at the foot of her bed, smiling kindly. ""Everything could be easier,"" he whispered, his voice calm but insistent. ""You wouldn’t even notice the change. No more aches, no more pains. Just... *better*.""

She woke with a start, heart pounding. The room was silent except for the faint sound of her phone buzzing. Bleary-eyed, she picked it up. Another text from a different number:**“It’s not too late.”**

Prudence deleted the message and tossed the phone onto her nightstand. This was getting weird. She decided to call the clinic in the morning and find out more about whatever was happening.

But by morning, something else had changed.

The neighbor’s dog’s incessant morning barking was gone. In fact, as she looked out her window, she saw Kip sitting directly next to their fence, staring intently at her. Silently. Maybe they got one of those shock collars or bark collars. A holiday miracle, she thought, as she walked into the kitchen. Her usual morning sluggishness was also gone. Prudence noticed it as soon as she stepped out of bed—her body felt lighter, her head clearer. It was unsettling. She didn’t feel like herself, though she couldn’t put her finger on why. And, it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. It was just different. Maybe it was that dose she took yesterday; maybe this new medication was just better. She took her gray pill, washing it down with some coffee.

Her phone buzzed again, the screen lighting up with another unknown number:**“You’re welcome.”**

That’s when Prudence remembered Tera’s words. *“Everything doesn’t suck anymore.”*

She stopped in her place. A chill ran over her body. Had they done something to her? Was it a trick, or worse—an experiment? She tried to call the clinic, but the line was busy. She called again. No answer.

Hours passed, and Prudence couldn’t shake the feeling of calm, even though she was never calm on a Sunday. Sunday Scaries were real for her – she’d had them ever since she was a little girl. The strange lightness in her body turned into an eerie detachment, like she was floating through the day. Her kids noticed her distraction and were louder and more rambunctious than normal, but she let it pass. Her husband mentioned her blank stare. Prudence brushed them off. She was just relaxed, she told them. But, she couldn’t put her finger on it. She wasn’t panicked by all this. She was actually being way more productive than she normally was. The entire thing was just strange. 

When she finally drove back to the clinic to talk to Dr. Lucky on Monday morning, the building was dark, the doors locked. A sign on the door read:

**“Closed for reorganization. Thank you for your patience.”**

Her phone buzzed one last time:**“Don’t fight it, Prudence. It’s easier this way.”**

Prudence’s breath caught in her throat as she stared at the sign on the clinic door.

Her phone buzzed again in her hand. She didn’t want to look but couldn’t resist.

**“Make an Appointment. We’ll explain everything. 815-990-4281.”**

She backed away from the clinic, clutching her phone tightly, the screen still glowing with the message. Her mind raced. How could they know she was here? Was she being watched? And, why her? She was just a regular person – a reasonable one, she reminded herself. Her body still felt lighter, more energized than usual, but that sensation left her feeling as though her own limbs were not entirely under her control. “As if driven by a motor,” she thought to herself. 

This evening, she couldn’t sleep. Her husband had no trouble, and while she was usually annoyed by his snoring and snorting, she found comfort in knowing she wasn’t alone. The sound of the wind outside resembled whispers. When she finally drifted off, the dreams returned—this time more vivid. Dr. Lucky was there again, his warm, confident smile now an unsettling mask. He stood next to her bed, holding a small vial of shimmering liquid.

“Why fight it, Prudence?” he said. His voice echoed in the dream, soft yet commanding. “You don’t have to struggle anymore. No one does. Be reasonable.”

She woke in a cold sweat, her throat dry, her heart hammering against her ribs. Stumbling to the bathroom, she splashed cold water on her face, trying to shake the lingering unease. When she looked up into the mirror, she froze.

Her reflection stared back at her, but something was wrong. Her eyes, usually warm and brown, were now faintly tinted with silver, the irises shimmering in the dim light. Her hands trembled as she reached up to touch her face, as if to confirm she was still herself.

\*\*\*

The next day, Prudence called the number she was instructed to on her phone. Tera answered, cheerful as usual. 

“Hey, girl! Did you change your mind?” Tera asked.

“No, not at all. Look, I need to make an appointment. And, I saw you guys moved. Why didn’t anyone mention that when I was there?”

“Oh, yes. I must have forgot. It’s been busy, you know. And, we’re busy. We’re about two weeks out. Everyone is trying to get this new medication. We’re actually having to work from an old office while we fix things up at the clinic. But, it’s right downtown. 345 Main. Will that work?”

Prudence paused. She wanted to talk to Dr. Lucky now. But, she wasn’t sick. And, maybe this eye things was just an old age thing. She’d look that up when she got home. 

“No, two weeks works. See you then.”

“Sounds good. I have you down. And remember, if you do change your mind, you don’t need an appointment. You can just call me, and I’ll open up for you.”

“No. Thank you.” Prudence ended the call. 

\*\*\*

**“How are we going to make it? Bonus book club? My house? Bring wine?”**

The next two weeks went quickly, and were filled with texts like this from Prudence’s group. Luckily, there were no more texts from the unknown numbers. Prudence had blocked each and everyone of them – someone got her number and was having some fun, she thought – the only reasonable explanation.  It was the last two weeks of school before winter break. Prudence’s days were full of work, then activities. Concerts for the boys, sports practices. Potluck prep for her husband. Not to mention gift buying, and wrapping. Along with holiday cards. These weeks were always the worst. There was so much to do, and one couldn’t even enjoy it.

But, this year was different. It was busy. It was so busy. But, Prudence just sailed through. People at work complimented on how fresh she looked. Her clothes were fitting better, but she associated this with just running all over the place and actually taking her meds. The staff at her school raved about the ham and beans she brought, and everyone even got seconds during their own luncheon. Her children didn’t complain about going non stop. Her husband complimented her and showed his appreciation through words and his actions. He even began doing laundry and making dinner a few nights during the week.

The only thing that was off – other than “things not sucking” as Tera had said, was the dreams. Prudence began to dream of Dr. Lucky every night. They didn’t feel like dreams. It felt like he was right there beside her bed. He wasn’t, obviously, because it would wake up her husband. But, it felt like he came to her each night, asking her questions, as he did in the office. Requesting she give this new medication a try. By the end of the two weeks, these talks had taken a turn. Dr. Lucky became angry, foreceful. One time, he had shaken her. 

“You’re just not being reasonable. Prudence, you need this. Your family needs you to take this. Look how much better this break was. Just take it.”

In another, he smiled and put his hands around her throat. 

“If you won’t be cooperative, then I am going to have to call someone else in. Just be reasonable, or else I won’t be able to help you.”

She awoke each time before she succumbed to the doctor, catching her breath. She reached over to her husband, who snorted and rolled over. They were always just a dream. 

One would think these nights of restless sleep would start to wear on a person. But, Prudence kept on keeping on, as she had started to say. They weren’t pleasant, but they weren’t hurting anyone. And, they weren’t holding her back. They were dreams. Dreams come and go. There is always a reasonable explanation for strange dreams. Just like her eyes, which continued to shimmer with a silver glow. She could explain this away, as well. It was the reflection from the new lights in the sconce her husband had installed. Same in her car – the silver was probably from the snow that blanketed the ground as the endured the first cold snap of the season. Everything was able to be explained. 

\*\*\*

Her appointment had finally arrived. As she approached the building, the sky looked – different. It was almost as if the sun and sky were washed out. Flat, almost. That happens sometimes when the sun is low, she thought. As she crossed the parking lot, she stopped. The building, this new one, seemed to be glowing or shimmering – metallic almost – though made of the same old brick as many other buildings in town. This stark contrast to the watercolor sky and surroundings was unsettling. It’s the position of the sun, she told herself. This time, the building was unlocked, though the waiting room was empty, its lights flickering faintly. A low hum filled the air, like machinery working behind the walls.

“Dr. Lucky?” she called out, her voice trembling.

A figure emerged from one of the exam rooms. It wasn’t Dr. Lucky. It was Tera, the receptionist, but her appearance was different. Her skin was pale, almost translucent, and her eyes shone with the same silvery hue Prudence had noticed in herself.

“We’ve been expecting you,” Tera said, smiling too wide, her teeth unnervingly perfect. “You’re going to feel so much better, Prudence. You probably already do. We thought you needed a little push. You’re just so reasonable. But, you’ve only gotten the tiny dose. Today, you get it all. Then, you’re going to feel so much better. Just like the rest of us.”

Behind Tera, shadows moved, taking the shape of figures—patients, nurses, all with the same silvery eyes and too-perfect smiles. 

She saw the man from the pharmacy, smiling as he received an infusion of a silvery liquid, which shimmered and glowed in its bag, and appeared to illuminate through the man’s veins in his thin, thin arms. There was her neighbor, Suzanne, who was waiting, smiling, on an exam table, as a nurse Prudence had never seen prepped a syringe of the same silver liquid, and smiling, shut the door in Prudence’s face. It appeared each of the 10 exam rooms were full, and in each, someone Prudence knew was ready to be seen. 

Tera came closer, trying to take Prudence by the arm. Prudence started to back up, but was stopped by a tall man dressed in scrubs, who towered over her smiling. She turned to run to the exit, which was only feet away, her pulse roaring in her ears. She realized too late that the clinic door had closed behind her with a soft, deliberate click.

\*\*\*

When Prudence got home from Dr. Lucky’s, she began dinner and a load of laundry. There were moments when she felt as if she were just going through the motions, like there was some silent scream ready to leave her lips. But, she helped her kids with their homework, rubbed her husband’s feet, and read two chapters in her book club book. The laundry was done and loaded, and the boys and her husband complimented her on the dinner. There were no fights over the video games, and no eye rolls when she said it was time for bed. The feeling she had, the terror and the dread, were wrapped, tucked deep, as if enveloped in a heavy, wool blanket. 

As she lay in bed, she grabbed her phone, and texted her book club group chat.

**“Hey there, girlies! It’s been a while. Just checking in. I’ve been reflecting a lot lately—about how hectic life gets, especially now. But something's... shifted for me.

I’m a young, fun, and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 34, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

If you would be interested in chatting and meeting up for coffee or brunch, feel free to shoot me a message!

I love my grand babies. Yet I was finding it harder and harder to keep up with them even in the simplest of activities. Me energy was always depleted. I need so many cups of coffee just to get through the day! 

This is me. The me on the LEFT was tired, slow, achy and on the verge of developing more health problems. Even though I was eating vegetarian I was gaining more weight. And it was harder to carry my grandson as he got older. 

The me on the RIGHT is me now, in the Primalbod program. I feel strong, lean and healthy. And I can scoop up my grandson with ease! 

I dropped the 20 in 10 weeks on Primalbod. I’ve now graduated to PrimalBabes and as of today I’m down a total of 30 pounds and 30 inches - but most importantly - I feel and look amazing at 60 years old! I run, jump and play with my grandson! This program far exceeded my wildest dreams! Follow the link in my bio if you want that too!

✅I’m down from size 12 to size 5/6  
✅ My knees and hips no longer ache! 
✅ I keep melting fat off my stomach & becoming more muscular and healthier as I age.

Follow the LINK for the program that’s gonna give you the body of your dreams! You deserve the gift of health in 2025 🎁

Alex(42M) & Bailey(33F) have been together for 8 months. No major issues, arguments other than one thing: hygiene. 

Alex would like to pop the question to Bailey sometime this year, but is annoyed by Bailey constantly nagging him about his hygiene, ie. asking if he’s showered/brushed teeth, telling him to close his mouth when chewing gum. He thinks she just has a major OCD problem about hygiene.

For months, Bailey has been trying patiently work with Alex on his hygiene, and as of recently been telling him that she is starting to get turned off, but still sees no changes. Bailey finally hit a breaking point. She wants to see a change in Alex’s hygiene and behavior before getting engaged and sharing a living space together.

***Who is the AH? See text chain below. Conversation happened after Alex hung up on Bailey after she got on him about his hygiene yet again –***

**Bailey**: 

I’ve come up with a great solution since you're tired of me bringing up your lack of hygiene- do not expect any sex from me.

It is disgusting to use equipment at a public gym that's covered in other people's bodily fluids and bacteria, then take that home along with your own sweat and spread it all over your furniture as you lounge around for hours. You expect me to believe that once we live together you'll miraculously stop doing this?

It is also disgusting that brushing your teeth is an afterthought- something you don't do until late in the afternoon most days, if at all, and that you refuse to brush/floss before bed. And yes, I know that's why you chew gum incessantly- to mask your halitosis. And while we're on the topic of gum, it's incredibly rude and annoying that, at 42 years old, you do not know how to chew with your mouth closed.

If the most basic of hygiene and proper etiquette is too hard for you to wrap your mind around then we will no longer work as a couple.

**Alex:** 

If i need to clean and eat after my workout it's stupid to brush and shower right before getting sweaty and getting food on my teeth. It's very frivolous for you to make a big deal of that.

I dont think that's the issue, it feels like you're starting a fight on purpose. I think you have a deeper issue.

**Bailey:**

I have never said you need to shower before a workout.

Brush your teeth after your first cup of coffee and before your workout - easy. Shower as soon as you come home from a workout - easy. Take 2 minutes to floss & brush after/before you take out your contacts before bed - easy.

There's not a deeper issue. I have told you multiple times it's a turn off and yet you do nothing differently. What do you expect?

**Alex:**

I get home from an arm workout and needed to clean the house and eat. In that scenario to brush and shower before doing so is stupid and inefficient as l'd be sweaty with food in my mouth right after showering and brushing.

**Bailey:** 

In that scenario:

1. ﻿﻿﻿It's gross AF and you should be ashamed that you and your child left that house without brushing your teeth.
2. ﻿﻿﻿So you're telling me you don't sweat at all when doing multiple arm workouts but you all of a sudden sweat when you clean? Lol, jfc, your mental gymnastics to try and get out of bathing are insane. What's next? That you sweat when typing emails so that's why you wait until the later afternoon to shower after your workouts during the weekday?
3. ﻿﻿﻿You should have showered after you got home from the gym, instead of sitting your and other people's funk on your upholstered dining chair while you mindlessly played on your phone for god knows how long.

**Alex:** 

I didn't eat anything so my mouth was no dirtier in the morning than it was all night. Should I start brushing at night? Yeah but that doesn't excuse this reaction from you.

Correct, no noticeable sweat from the arm workout and considerable sweat from cleaning and dishes...I have no reason to lie about that...

It's odd to me you have become so maniacal about something that has not changed for me...it's concerning because what else will you suddenly start freaking out about in the future.

The fact that my bathing and brushing has not changed but suddenly made you go nuts makes it logical to conclude that there's something else to this.

**Bailey**: 

Lol, having an understanding of basic hygiene is not maniacal.Just like repeatedly asking somebody to close their fucking mouth when chewing gum isn't maniacal. Because I love you, I've tried overlooking it the past 8 months but I cannot anymore because at this point I am completely turned off from you and your nasty habits.

Takes \~10 minutes, I have a coffee.

My problem is that the account balance feature makes the assumption that if you don't have any data uploaded... your balance must be $0! As a result, if my CSV stops at say 2025-01-03, then my mortgage must be paid off to $0. Obviously, this is not the case.

I suspect this might be because it still thinks this account is ""active"" or a connection (will accounts and connections ever be split apart?) -- am I better off just making a manual account and uploading CSVs for Balance and Transactions?

This is my 2nd go with OMAD, I had great success before losing 30lbs but then life got in the way and weight crept back up. 

I'm in it for the long haul now as it's the only thing that has ever worked for me and I've been overweight my whole life. I'm 40 this year and I've finally had enough of being obese. 

So I started on the 1st, I say dirty OMAD because I have one white coffee with one sugar in the morning and if I'm really struggling I'll eat a hand of nuts or a bit of cheese to get me to my window. On those days I guess it's more 20/4. But this is fine as my main goal is weightloss and I know if I restrict myself too much in the early days, I'll fail. 

Before I started I had a bit of a zero sugar cola addiction so caffeine, aspartame. And I didn't restrict carbs. 

I don't restrict carbs now either but just eating once a day has obviously cut them right down,  I was a bread fiend. 

Every evening about 4 hours after eating (I eat at lunch time) I get a headache. It's not blinding but it's uncomfortable and annoying. I assumed it was withdrawal but it's been 5 days now?

A couple of months ago, I launched my first Android mobile game, **""Cat Island Crafter""**, on Google Play. It’s a casual clicker/resource-gathering game made with Unity, designed for moments when you’re watching a movie, waiting for your coffee, or just bored at work.

So far, it has around 50 installs(couple of downloads and deinstalls every day), and some players seem to enjoy it for hours (shoutout to my 13-hour champ in Malaysia!), but I know it has so much more potential.

**What’s great about the game right now:**

* Enough content to keep casual players entertained for a few months.
* A relaxing vibe perfect for low-pressure gameplay.

**What it needs:**

* **New game mechanics** to keep things fresh and interesting.
* **Better visuals**—more special effects and animations to make the world pop.
* A **complete UI overhaul** (seriously, it’s bad, and I know it).
* Planned **online features** for competitive/cooperative play.

I’m looking for passionate Unity developers and creatives (animators, artists, game designers, sound designers—you name it!) who see potential in the game and have ideas on how to make it better. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, if you want to contribute, you’re in.

This is a hobby/rev-share project—so while I can’t offer upfront payment, I’m more than willing to share future revenue if we can make something amazing together.

Take a look at the game, and if you’re intrigued or already have ideas brewing, let’s talk!

Let’s create something awesome, not just for the players but for ourselves as creators.

Interests were to see the beautiful sights and eat delicious local food. Tip:  everything is slightly cheaper if paying cash. Posting what I did for early January. 

Stayed total of 4 nights. 
Day 1
I rented a car from rent-a-wreck, nice local company, cheapest I found for a basic sedan. Cash only for cheapest rate, I feel you don’t really need anything crazy for off-roading unless your itinerary suggests that. 
Drove to princeville and stayed at the Wyndham Ka Eo Kai. Great value for a resort, near many local beaches and Hanalei. 
Ate poke and sushi lunch at dolphins fish market, highly recommend. You get a backdrop of the river and the canyons - it was truly breathtaking.

Then hiked down to Wyllie beach, very muddy when I went , recommend hiking pole and or good shoes. Beach was calm and not crowded. It is connected to Anini beach, great to spend a day. 

Went to dinner at Bar Acuda restaurant as recommended. It’s probably the more vibey places in the area. Great food, awesome bartender. I got seated immediately without resy when I went around 5-5:30p. Hanalei town is cute and lively at night. 

Day 2
Drove to Nourish for açaí and coffee. Good açaí  and better views. So many rainbows. 
Then met up with Airbnb experience with a local guide which was a highlight.  We went to Ha’ena state park. You need to make prior resy to enter and or permit if you’re gonna camp/hike the entire Kalalau trail. We hiked two miles for some epic viewpoints, didn’t go to the beach as it was quite muddy. Again, poles and good shoes recommend. We also went to some local spots for a river watering hole to swim and some ate delicious poi cheesecake- Waipa foundation. 
Ended day eating at dolphins again for dinner. 

Day 3
Morning, drove to Kilauea to Java Kai for a Mac nut latte. Was delicious , I was also recommended Kilauea bakery as well by my guide. Then hiked to the lighthouse viewpoint nearby, nice little adventure to see some wildlife. 

Drove to Kapa’a, stayed at the Kauai beach hostel. Overall good experience- provided basic needs. It was“pricey” for a hostel but cheaper than any other hotel nearby. Had a nice social vibe and parking was free. I stayed in a private room overlooking the beach, which was probably the best part.

Then went on a sunset Na Pali cruise with Holo holo. The experience was very much worth the money spent. The crew was professional, very helpful with picture taking, and the dinner served was delicious. Saw whales and a breathtaking sunset. I also noted that our cruise was not overcrowded. Very comfortable around 20-30 people on the catamaran. Will note, I usually don’t get sea sick but even towards the end, it was getting rocky and def felt it. I heard that it was unusually very calm for us- so take that with a grain of salt. Tiring day but it was so fulfilling. 

Day 4 
Prepared for a long day to Waimea canyon. Had Java Kai again in Kapa’a- solid breakfast egg sandwich.  
Drove up the Waimea canyon at around 8:00am to visit all four outlooks. Need to pay for parking and single entry fee ($15). There was fog - heard it was coming from the big island. The views were still epic, it got clearer with the ascension. My favorite one was the last one Pu’u O Kila Lookout- the road is closed off due to potholes but parked right were it was closed off and walked about a mile up to the actual lookout. Good “hike“ and happy since I wasn’t going to venture alone to any of the numerous ones off the main road. The last overlook connects to the Pihea trail, which was nice to do a part of it. Really clear views and it was not overcrowded. 

Drove down to the Koke’e museum on the same road, very neat to learn more about the canyon. Had nice souvenirs to buy. There’s also a lodge for eating right next to it. 
Then drove down back to Waimea, to Jojo’s shaved ice. Delicious, I liked they served macadamia nut ice cream with their ice. 

Next drove to Koloa fish market for late lunch, got poke -they also had Kalua pork, wished I got. Drove to Poipu beach to lay and see the sunset turtles, there was plentiful parking. Don’t forget the water shoes like I did, there’s snorkeling and lots of reef. Water was warm. 

Drove back to Kapa’a for the 1st Saturday (of the month) Art fair. Lots of traffic as expected. There were lots of food trucks and cute local artists selling their goods. Ordered a smash burger from Smitty’s- really yummy and also had pork skewers from Pork Sticks. 
Nice to see all the locals and tourists come out - had good people watching. 

Overall thoughts: 
I recommend splitting the time between the north side and the rest of the island, there can be traffic due to road work which results in long travel times. Would have liked to stayed another day or two to see the local farmers market and hike a bit more. Always felt safe. Kauai is a great solo destination albeit pricey. Hope this helps!

I’m using a coffee racer at the moment but the castors even when locked still slide under braking. 

Are there any good matts out there that are anti-slip and also will absorb vibrations? Reason I’m asking for matts is so I can wheel it onto it rather than having to lift the castors into those rubber cup type things I’ve seen people suggest, as the rig is very heavy.

Thanks!

1huicmy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1huicmy,"AIO? My girlfriend seems like she hates me or wants me to feel bad about myself all the time, under the disguise of wanting better for me. I(M34) (F26) ","I’m very sick. Last week Wednesday I started feeling sick and took an EmergenC immediately to try and combat the illness. Her response to that was to laugh at me because to her it’s pointless to take those things since the immune system can’t be boosted. My response was ok fine, in my mind I was more so trying to give my body the reinforcement it needed to fight off the cold/sicnkess. She doubled down that it was pointless and that my body is feeling the way it does because it’s already fighting. To that I then asked, well what’s wrong with me wanting to help it? She has a medical background and her replies stems from that. 


A few days ago(Thursday night into am) I’m in bed sleeping and I wake myself up coughing. This bothered me because I know she needs her sleep and she has health issues and often sleeps a lot but still gets the feeling of not getting enough sleep. So essentially, sleep is very important for her. To the point where she can be a normal human and push herself to to stay up more and do more but deals with it later that she needs more sleep than normal to make up for staying  awake. She works 3 12s a week and is off 4 days.  So again, when I woke myself up, she was literally the first thing on my mind because I didn’t want to wake her up and so I  felt bad her having to be woken up by me coughing. 


I work overnights on the weekend and so I’ve been pushing myself to still work because we need the money. I also do delivery on the side so she suggested that I stayed home from delivery on Friday so I can rest for work that following night. 


I had a bad time at work. I’m a stockers and it’s a new position so I’m essentially already pushing myself to reach my times and being sick did not help at all. So I had a shitty experience at work. 


Yesterday(Saturday) I woke up and wanted to try and have sex because as sick as I am, I’m still interested in my girlfriend and I still want her to feel wanted and I Still am trying to do my part in being affectionate because this is something she asked me to be more of. So I wake up and we are in bed together just scrolling our phones; I realize this and I make an attempt to rub on her body because I know this is something she really really enjoys. For transparency, I want to point out that as much as I was sick, I was willing to prioritize her needs. As much as it seems like maybe, maybe not, I was most likely not thinking properly. While massaging her, I realized that she did not show any interest in putting her phone down and I asked her if she wanted me to stop. She replied and said, “no I don’t want you to stop but I get the feeling you’re doing it because you want to have sex and I don’t want to because you’re sick.”

This was more than ok with me. What wasn’t ok with me is the lack of communication. My girlfriend is autistic and is very literal. She doesn’t hold anything back much and is very verbal about how she feels. 
So when I realize that I’m laying there wasting time, it felt annoying because why didn’t you just say that to begin with. Why let it get to the point where you’re just taking as I’m giving. Instead of making it an issue, I decide to just put some space between us and go out into the living room. I told her that I’m going to go spend time with my kids since I’ve been sick and not around them much. 

I do that and she didn’t seem to be bothered by it. She came out and was dressed for the day, made her coffee and went into our gaming room to further work on a project she’s doing. She texted me asking what I wanted to do for dinner and I told her the kids are eating leftovers and that idk about myself and her for dinner.  Me being paranoid about not giving her enough attention, leave the kids about an hour later and then go to her and sat at my desk. Just to let her know I was there and to make it easier for her if she ever wanted to game or do something else. At this point my daughter was eating a “late lunch” and my oldest (13) had asked me what were we having for dinner. I replied I don’t know and I suggested that she ate leftovers because when it comes to them eating, I’m mostly making them a meal or my gf is doing the cooking. 
My daughter didn’t really care. She didn’t think to eat the leftovers because she thought it had went bad(common assumption when something is out of sight out of mind) and just assumed I was going to cook. I told her I’m really sick and so I didn’t want to make a new meal and that she should eat the leftovers or literally anything else that she could make. 

My 6 yr old son who I was not concerned about because I knew he would eat the leftover; expressed that he was hungry and so I made him a plate and he ate dinner. After that event that happened while I was hanging out with them, I’m in the gaming room with her and she asks me what are we having for dinner, I reply and said I don’t know and that I haven’t been feeling really good about not having enough money to get what I want. She then starts asking me what is it that I want and why can’t I have it. There is a steakhouse near me called Fuji Steakhouse and ideally I said that to give an idea of I didn’t  want to cook food, I more so wanted it prepared for me and I just pay for it. This is how my brain works when I’m sick. The less work the better. 

At this point she starts talking to me about how I need to not be that way and it’s my perspective that’s f’d up and why I’m so unhappy all the time. I suffer with depression(undiagnosed) and only recently I’ve acknowledged it and started giving it attention. So in the moment she starts doing this(something that she often does) I immediately start feeling like I’m the problem and I’m wrong for wanting to buy restaurant food. I immediately regret saying I wanted the food that I couldn’t get so I might just suck it up and not eat till lunch at work. As I’m typing this I’m realizing that might have been a trigger for her? Because she then gets further upset at me and dismisses the conversation. She gets up and goes into the bedroom and proceeds to go to bed(not having interest in herself eating anymore) without saying anything so I clearly knows she’s upset with me. 

Moments go by and I have nothing to do so I decide to rest before work in an attempt to have more energy for my shift; I go into the bedroom and tell her that I’d like to sleep before work and would that make her feel uncomfortable , she replied and said “I’m trying to sleep”. I replied “alright” then walk out and close the door. I went to my kids room and laid down on one of the beds as they were watching TV together. I get up a hr later because I couldn’t sleep as fast as I thought I could and essentially got 30 mins of sleep(according to my watch) then got ready and left for work. Work is hell. Work is pressure. I take my first 15 min break. I realize she texted me at 11:09 PM. Keep in mind, there’s a 100% chance I saw that text and was just struggling to keep my times up and didn’t think to reply. That or my sick brain just didn’t process that I needed to reply right away. While on my break I reply to her text above and so forth. 

Fast forward to Now Time I came home and just slept in my smaller kid’s room cuz it was empty and nobody would be bothered by my coughing. My son came back from church with his mom and the door was locked so his mom called and woke me up. I assume this moving around the house woke her up or she was already awake. I go back and lay down and these texts above come in. It’s 1:37 PM when my son gets back and we are in his room. 


There are other situations in our relationship that motivate us to work on our relationship and work harder to get to a healthier relationship but the more I’m here I feel like I’m the problem and because of those past situations, I may just have ruined the relationship and I should just end things and allow her to find happiness elsewhere and have a better experience. I love this woman dearly. She’s changed my in such a good way and I haven’t ever completed a thought about my life without her in it. I’m just feeling like I can’t ever do enough and that I’m not enough or it’s always something. Idk what to do. I plan on scheduling a session with my therapist to get more help and learn more skills to strengthen my growth. This morning just seemed like she hated me and was not happy here and it came out in how she spoke to me. 

I’m nowhere near perfect. I started caring about my life late and as a result, I’m a work in progress. Experiences like this make me feel like I’m ruining her life and as im typing this; I’m starting to feel like I hate myself for making her unhappy.",2,1736113777.0,AmIOverreacting,10,0.75,False

He was very nice & said I was so beautiful, we got on really well in those short 3 minutes, he asked for my number and I gave it to him.

He texted me almost straight away to say he wanted to meet me and go for some coffee, but I unfortunately had to fly back home to England.

I visited Scotland again on the 30th December. He said he absolutely wanted to meet me. I met him and we had an amazing time. He kissed me at the end, on the lips and on my hand and asked me multiple times if I wanted to see him again, I said yes definitely.

After the date, he texted me to say ""enjoy your show"" with a smiley face, because I had booked to see a theatre show while I was there.

I flew back the next morning.

I decided to text him today because I hadn’t heard from him since after the date evening. 

""

heres the update after I just texted him:

me = ""when do you think we can see each other again, I really liked you""

him = good morning, yes we will arrange something again, do you plan on coming to scotland again soon?

me = no plans

him = i can come over to you. possibly around march, got a few things here to do first

me = ok thats good id really like to see you if you come

I’ve been a single parent for the last year after leaving a tough situation with nothing but the clothes on our backs. We are still in limbo accommodation wise.

I’m dealing with a lot, illness progressively getting worse, work issues, no family support and dealing with an ex that is abhorrently difficult and manipulative.

Hate my body, can’t shift weight, I used to be an athlete before that relationship. I don’t have anyone around me to big me up- I know, I need to be my biggest fan but Christ I’m lonely, no gals per say to meet with for coffees or a spot of shopping.

My child is a toddler and very very difficult to manage. My job is nice, not going well at the minute and it’s causing so much anxiety. I’m trying to save but for what I don’t know, I won’t ever get a mortgage because of my health, don’t know where we will be a year from now. Studying but behind on course work because of illness and life circumstances. Constantly broke, constantly sad, constantly burnt out, constantly feeling pulled in every direction- yes I’m in therapy and on meds.

Nothing feels okay at the moment and I’m teetering on a very slim ledge ready to jump or be pushed. Watching my peers get married, buy houses all of that lovely stuff and I’m floating out here. I want to escape healthily unlike ways that smothered me in the past, I want to feel like myself again, see the world a bit, feel young and happy yet I’m stuck in this perpetual routine of obligation that I’m becoming allergic to.

So, when does it get better? I’m hoping soon because I’ve had enough. I am miserable. Don’t feel like I can speak about with my therapist for fear of being admitted, they are affiliated with my healthcare, I need help, in every way possible but I’m very lost and numb.

1hui9p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1hui9p5/finally_came_out_to_my_dad/,Finally came out to my dad,"I'm a binary trans man, 20 y/o. I've been completely out as a man with my new name to my mom and sister for almost a year now. They're both doing their best to use the right name, even if they still mess up sometimes. Last month, I finally got my name legally changed! My mom came with me and it went very well. 

I went home to my mother's house over winter break and my mom kept telling me that I ""had"" to come out to my dad now. I've known that for a while now. But I'm also 10 months on t, so I was also just hoping he would notice and say something. 

I live alone, and mostly my parents come around when they have something they need to do in the area where I live, and my dad often fixes things around my house. He came over to my house this weekend, and he texted me before hand using my chosen name. So I had to assume that my mom told him that I had changed my name, but I didn't know what else she had said. He's not a very talkative man, so I didn't know what he was going to say, if anything. At first he simply asked me how I spelled my name, and started using my name that day. He slipped up a few times, but corrected himself. It was going better than I thought it would. 

Then, this morning while we were drinking coffee on my couch, he asked me if I had anything to tell him. I said yes, but that I was very scared to say it, and I didn't know if I even could. I sat there for like 5 mins trying to get the words to come out of my mouth before he asked, ""Is it that you want to get a sex change?"" And I said, ""Yes, that's pretty much it."" I then proceeded to give him the basic definition of ""transgender"" and tell him that I am a man, and that I've known for years, but was to scared to say anything. 

He's a boomer, so I didn't expect him to understand very much, and he seems to see it in more medicalized way. He admitted he doesn't know much about it, but he said it was okay. That I'm an adult and can do what I want, and that he just wants me to be happy. I didn't think he would be unaccepting, but it went better than I thought it would. He also said that he had noticed things over the years, and also noticed my voice getting deeper in the last few months. 

I expected to feel more relieved that I'm finally out to all my immediate family, but I'm actually really anxious right now. It feels like I hid it for so long, which I did for a reason. I still wish I didn't have to come out at all. I knew my parents wouldn't have believed me if I had come out before I was an adult. My mom admitted she stills thinks I might change my mind. 

Even with a pretty accepting family, the mental toll from being in the closet and knowing I would have to come out one day was harder than I thought it would be. I feel so exhausted. 

I was sort of forced to come out to my mom because of something she found in my room. (I actually came out to her the first time a few years ago, but she ignored it for the most part). And now I feel like my mom forced me to come out to my dad as well. But in both cases I knew I had to anyways? I guess??

I'm grateful to have a family who is accepting and willing to call me the right name. And I never had to worry about being kicked out of the house when I still lived with them. But I still feel so anxious and tired. 

I've been so happy to be on t and to present as male at school. I just hate coming out. I hate having to explain myself in a certain way in order to have my identity respected. I feel like I'm finally allowing myself to be who I am, but I'm still scared about people's reactions. I hate that I have to come out at all. 

I grew up in an accepting environment. I was allowed to cut my hair and dress however I want. And yet, being transgender has still felt like a traumatizing thing. Does the anxiety over people's reactions ever go away? I'm just really tired of feeling this way. ",1,1736113573.0,ftm,1,1.0,False

I really tried to be a supportive friend and listen to her issues or offer comfort and support. But after a while I grew a bit sad because it felt like I couldn’t share any form of news about my life with her. 

She recently made some new friends who decided to throw her a party for her birthday, I was invited as an after thought as the invitation I received the rsvp date had already passed. I felt kinda sad about it and needed some space to think about if I would attend. I decided to go and picked out a really thoughtful gift for her only for her to dismiss it and eventually by the end of the night she threw up on it.

In the last few months we met up for coffee and I told her about some heartbreaking news that I had gone through a miscarriage. I’m not really one to open up about news like this but figured because she was my friend I’d share with her. The situation was immediately downplayed and made me feel like I wasn’t allowed to be sad about the situation at all.

We’re very comfortable with each other, have gone on vacations just the two of us, and she even invited me to a party with her hometown friends to introduce me. We've also had several “friend dates,” like visiting museums, having coffee, and so on.

We share a lot with each other, trust one another deeply, and are always fair in how we treat each other. Over the past year, I’ve developed feelings for her, but I struggled with them for a long time. She often complimented my appearance, and although I’ve never had issues with dating in general, she has always been a central figure in my mind because she is such an incredibly comforting presence in my life.

Yesterday, I finally confessed my feelings to her, and her response left me confused. She said she’s unsure and worried. Then she suggested we talk about it again on Wednesday when we see each other.

For now, I’ve left it at that, but this uncertainty feels even worse than before when I hadn’t told her.

Ever since I was a child, my family have always made comments about my weight and what I eat. The common phrase was that if I ate too much I would go 'pop and bang'. I grew up developing intense body image problems, especially in my mid to late teens. Ironically, that was when I had the least comments because I was at a dance school and at the lowest weight ever. But of course, after I left and moved to a less physically active job, I became not as thin as I used to be. I accepted that a long time ago but my family have not moved past the eating and weight comments. They gave me a Fitbit and an Apple watch for Christmas (given in different years) as a way to 'motivate me' to exercise, even when I did not ask for it. Ever since I explained that these comments have hurt me in the past, the conversation has now moved to being concerned with my 'health'.

Last year I was diagnosed with a thyroid problem which led to me having drastic, unhealthy weight-loss and no one commented any 'concerns' about this. I have taken measures to not put my body and mind under such stress that it will trigger my symptoms - now all my family think that now I am on medicine I am all better and can go to all-standing concerts for 90 minutes (for example) when that is far from the case.

Years passed and I learned to love myself and my body. I stopped weighing myself on scales. I acknowledge that I am beautiful, and while I do want to lose weight, I can't afford to go to the gym but in the meantime have been more mindful of what I eat. No specific plan, just feeling things out.

Well, a few days before Christmas my brother invited me for coffee at his flat. I knew he wanted to talk to me about something and as we sat down his partner was in another room, and his laptop was on the table, he preceded to say that now I had come out as trans masc that he was worried about the 'risks' that might happen because of my weight. So, his present is to buy me a year's worth of weight loss drugs. Bearing in mind that I have been on the weight list for chest surgery for a few years this has never come up in conversation before, not until these drugs were being sold worldwide.

I know there are people who are taking them and it has been great, and I do not judge those who take them. But for me, I do not know enough about the long-term effects and with my thyroid issues, I do not want to put some magical drug in my body.

I wish I could say this was the last straw with my family, but it most likely isn't. I have communicated how they have treated me hurtfully, tried to set boundaries, and tried to be independent because I do not trust them with any information I give them - *nothing works*. Yet I don't want to lose them. We had such great times when I was suppressing my symptoms trying to be normal, but the moment I stopped it has been a difficult relationship to maintain ever since.

Does anyone here have useful tactics to maintain low contact (or even completely cut off) with family after moving out? I was made redundant last year and had to move in with my parents (which has been, you guessed it, awful. The best quote was that I am 'autistic and confused'). But when I move out, I want them out for good. When I don't talk to them for long periods of time, they are the least stressful periods of my life.",2,1736112966.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False
1huhzvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1huhzvj/help_talking_to_a_girl_i_dont_know_33m/,Help talking to a girl I don't know 33M,"Hello. I would like some advice on my situation.
Yesterday I was at a pub with some friends, and I noticed that the bartender was looking at me every time she had the chance for the entire time I was there. Normally I'm oblivious to every possible attention signal I receive, I am a disaster at dating, but I think this time it was really a staring contest. Very strangely I'd add, because she was very, very pretty.

As I said, I really suck at dating, and I actually never did, in a strict sense. I've been in two relationships in my life, and both times I was approached, and I have never tried to talk first to someone I like. I'm introvert, shy, rarely go out, and I'm very insecure. I forced myself to try and walk up to the bar, asking for WiFi, and ordering drinks. Same stares exchange, but I couldn't think of a way to say anything else. I got very nervous, I'm not used to this, and her looks were obviously making me anxious.

The only thing I can think of, to get a second chance, is to visit the pub again (I was thinking alone), and once she's not surrounded by co-workers (to reduce her and most of all my embarrassment), to go say something along the lines of ""hi, I know this might sound weird and embarrassing, it definitely is for me, but I think you are very pretty, and I was wondering if you'd want to grab a drink or coffee together one day?"", and if she (hopefully) says yes, leave her my number so she can think of a time and we can decide a place. Of course, this is based entirely on the assumption that I can actually gather the courage to do it.

To the help part: is it crazy of me to think this is even normal? Is going there on my own creepy (I would be embarrassed to go with someone else, I rarely go out, and I have very few friends)? Is it creepy to try and choose a moment where she's a bit more isolated (I think otherwise it'll be an embarrassment)? Is proposing a coffee or drink too cheap and low effort? Should I ask to go for a dinner or a meal? I don't want to sound cheap, but a meal is a longer time to spend together if things don't go well. Should I just use a totally different approach?

## Keurig K-Café Essentials Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker: A Deep Dive

In today's fast-paced world, convenience is king.  For coffee lovers, this translates to a quick, easy, and delicious way to start the day. The Keurig K-Café Essentials single-serve K-Cup pod coffee maker aims to deliver just that, offering a blend of affordability, versatility, and user-friendliness that’s hard to beat.  This in-depth review will explore its features, benefits, and drawbacks, helping you determine if it's the perfect addition to your kitchen.


### **Unpacking the Essentials: Key Features and Benefits**

The Keurig K-Café Essentials isn't just another single-serve coffee maker; it's a compact powerhouse designed to elevate your daily coffee ritual.  Its core strength lies in its ability to deliver a consistently flavorful cup of coffee with minimal effort.  Let's break down its key features:

* **Brew Size Flexibility:**  Choose from 6, 8, 10, or 12-ounce cup sizes, catering to individual preferences and serving sizes.  This flexibility ensures you always get the perfect amount of coffee, avoiding wasteful over-brewing or weak, diluted drinks.

* **Strong Brew Option:** For those who prefer a bolder, more intense coffee flavor, the strong brew setting delivers a more robust and satisfying cup.  This feature is a significant upgrade from basic single-serve machines and caters to coffee connoisseurs who appreciate a richer taste.

* **Integrated Milk Frother:** This is where the K-Café Essentials truly shines.  The built-in milk frother effortlessly creates creamy, velvety foam, transforming your simple cup of coffee into a decadent latte or cappuccino.  No more separate frothers cluttering your countertop!

* **Generous Water Reservoir:** With a 60-ounce water reservoir, you'll spend less time refilling and more time enjoying your coffee. This is a significant advantage over smaller-capacity machines, particularly for households with multiple coffee drinkers.

* **Intuitive Operation:** The simple and intuitive interface makes brewing a breeze, even for first-time Keurig users.  The controls are clear, straightforward, and easy to navigate, minimizing any learning curve.


### **Design and Build: A Closer Look**

The Keurig K-Café Essentials has a sleek, modern design that complements most kitchen aesthetics. Its footprint is relatively large (12.5 x 15.3 x 12 inches), so consider your counter space before purchasing.  The build quality is solid, using durable materials that suggest longevity.  While the size might be a drawback for some, its larger build could be a positive for users with larger hands, offering a more comfortable and ergonomic experience.


### **Practical Applications: Beyond the Basic Brew**

The K-Café Essentials isn't limited to just regular coffee.  Its versatility extends to a range of coffee-based beverages:

* **Lattes and Cappuccinos:**  The integrated milk frother makes creating creamy lattes and cappuccinos a simple process. Experiment with different types of milk and flavorings to customize your drinks.

* **Hot and Cold Beverages:** While primarily designed for hot beverages, some users have reported success in using the machine to create iced coffee by brewing over ice.

* **Variety of K-Cup Pods:**  Utilize the wide array of K-Cup pods available, allowing you to explore different coffee roasts, flavors, and intensities to find your perfect brew.


### **K-Café vs. K-Café Essentials: A Head-to-Head Comparison**

The Keurig K-Café Essentials is an upgrade from its predecessor, the original K-Café.  Key improvements include:

* **Enhanced Milk Frother:** The frother in the Essentials model has seen a redesign, resulting in improved performance and easier cleaning.

* **Auto-Off Feature:**  This energy-saving feature automatically shuts off the machine after a period of inactivity, conserving energy and promoting safety.


### **Cost Considerations:  Value for Your Money**

The Keurig K-Café Essentials typically retails for around $189. While this might seem expensive upfront, consider the long-term value.  The convenience of consistently brewing high-quality coffee at home, coupled with the milk frothing capabilities, justifies the price for many users.  Keep an eye out for sales and discounts, which can significantly reduce the initial cost.  The ongoing cost of K-Cups should also be factored into your budget, but even with this added expense, many find the overall cost per cup comparable to or less than purchasing coffee from a cafe.


### **Market Trends and Consumer Preferences**

The single-serve coffee maker market is booming, driven by consumer demand for convenience and personalized coffee experiences.  Trends indicate a growing interest in sustainability, with more consumers seeking eco-friendly options. While K-Cups aren't the most sustainable choice, the convenience they offer remains a significant draw for many.


### **Addressing Common Concerns: FAQs**

* **Cleaning:**  Regular cleaning is essential to maintain optimal performance.  The reservoir and frother require periodic cleaning to prevent buildup and ensure smooth operation.  Consult the user manual for detailed cleaning instructions.

* **Descaling:**  Hard water can lead to mineral buildup, impacting the machine's efficiency.  Regular descaling, using the machine's descaling mode, is crucial for maintaining its longevity and performance.


### **Conclusion: Your Perfect Daily Brew Awaits?**

The Keurig K-Café Essentials single-serve K-Cup pod coffee maker offers a compelling blend of convenience, versatility, and value.  Its ease of use, integrated milk frother, and ability to brew a consistently delicious cup make it a strong contender in the crowded single-serve coffee market. While the initial investment might seem significant, the long-term convenience and ability to create barista-style drinks at home often outweigh the cost for many coffee lovers.  If you’re looking for a reliable, user-friendly machine that delivers a great cup of coffee without the fuss, the Keurig K-Café Essentials is definitely worth considering.

I made a delicious coffee after watching a youtube video by Tom’s coffee corner on how to set it up and dial it in. After watching further YouTube videos on this one I decided to return it as several videos indicated that it will likely not last past 3-5 years. I thought $1,000 CAD was too much to spend on something that was going to be in the landfill in 3-5 years.

I ended up exchanging it for the Breville Bambino and bought the Breville smart grinder pro.

However, this comes out too quickly so I’ve tried to decrease the grind size but the Bambino isn’t working with a lower grind size!!! It takes forever to spit out the espresso and when it does, only one side of the porta filter is spewing.

I moved to Perth early 2001, when I came, it was the 1st time here.

When everyone found out i was heading over, it was all ""Visit Freo"". Apparently it's the Bees Knees and Ducks Guts.

I got there, exoecting the streets to be paved with gold.

I grew up near a working port - it was my families local shopping area, back in the 80s and 90s - so i'm used to the back drop of docked ships and all. The only real difference between there and Freo, is Freo has more coffee shops, more old hippies who made their money back in the 80s, and overpriced junk.

I'm 34F, not single and I'm looking for a long-term, day-to-day girlypop friendship 🍬✨ with someone who enjoys sharing the little things in life like complaining, info dumping, sending memes & tiktoks, and just wading through this rotten world together every day, one message at a time, keeping each other company.

I often feel like the odd duck as I'm neurodivergent, very introverteded and shy, not into traveling, or many outdoorsy activities. I love cozy gloomy weather, staying inside with nice coffee and snacks 🍰, browsing Reddit, watching anime, and of course gaming on my Steam Deck or Switch, and watching fun stuff on YouTube. 

Life's a struggle, and while I try not to be a negative person, I like keeping things real. Optimists, you're sweet, but this isn't your stop! I want someone who'll vibe with me in the messiness of it all-whether it's gossiping, venting about work, and hating your enemies 💅 Tell me about your day, share what you're eating or what you're watching, send me tiktoks and flood me with BRAINROT.
 
I've been playing Infinity Nikki and Halls of Torment a lot lately, and enjoying silly Tiktoks lately after a rough start of the year. Also some Pokémon TCG Pocket! if you're into that. I love tons of games obviously, from Bloodborne to Nintendo games :3 It would be ideal to have a gaming friend since that's one of my main interests, but it's not required.

This is for platonic friends only. Seriously, no flirting. I've been stung before by people who pretended to be friends but wanted more, so please don't contact me if that's not what you're looking for!

If you're not genuinely interested in building a friendship (e.g., you're just bored at work or ""like talking to new people"" as a hobby), skip me. I'm selective, but I won't waste your time.

1huhno3,https://www.reddit.com/r/larqbottle/comments/1huhno3/issue_with_purevis2_water_flow/,Issue with PureVis2. Water flow,"Hi all,

Interested in receiving some feedback here with your experiences with the PureVis 2. 

I love my bottle. Tracking works great. UV-C cleaning works great. Straw even works great. My issue is with the filter and the water flow. Before I go any further, yes, I did remove the plastic from the filter when I received the bottle. The first few days were great, some resistance but no real issues. Around the third or fourth day, it became nearly impossible to drink through the filter straw. So much so that after a week of continued use, I have some soreness in my mouth and throat. At this point I have removed the filter and no issues. 

I have tried trouble shooting:
1. Ensuring the filter is seated properly
2. The straw is seated properly
3. Everything in the straw is assembled correctly. 

I have reached the conclusion that this must be a faulty filter issue because there is no way this is normal. Like sucking a milkshake through a coffee straw. This is with the essential filter as well. If this is normal operation I do not know how the advanced filter is even usable. 

Can anyone else share their experience using the filter? Filtering water from the bottle itself was one of my most anticipated features so needless to say I am pretty bummed.

1huhnjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1huhnjn/feedback_needed_for_kitchen_redesign_concept/,Feedback needed for kitchen redesign concept ,"I have a 1950s ear in kitchen that's very small. The n (think upside down u shape) kitchen layout does not work for me. I am not going to open it up into open concept. It's approximately 8x8 feet.

My idea because I need way more dilirsge and counters than I have is switch to smaller appliances and make the work space area a L(a upside down L) keeping the window and sink on the wall they are on but shifting it over with new cabinets and putting the fridge and stove along one wall. On the wall across is have uppers and lowers with counter space and storage and have a place to set the coffee maker toaster toaster oven and microwave and still have work prep surface while having a designated breakfast/snack prep area.

Small issue is even with changing to a 24 inch fridge and stove that only leaves roughly 16 or 18 inch of counter as landing zone between the fridge and stove for short term setting down items because I want to be able to use the space in the corner and will need a lazy Susan there. 

I'm not sure about the 16-18 inches because I'm not sure if a lazy Susan is small enough to allow more and I'm not sure how wide the counter will be (I want it able to accommodate WQ18 inch platters)l o. The shelves not the lazy Susan nit sure if the uppers or lowers. 

I'm considering the type of lazy Susan where the doors swing I. As the shelves come out a kidney I think they call it.

There will theoretically be space for a dishwasher on the sink wall but there's a small issue of a step that is possibly  a stair bulkhead in the corner and I don't know if it can be got rid of or if it will have to be worked around with regards to sink placement.

I may put a pass through window behind the table in the eat I. End if I can and am thinking of pushing that wall into the living room to widen it so tgeee can be storage there under the pass through as well (there is no pass through currently).

Does this sound feasible? Remember there will be counter space beside the sink and across from the fridge and stove wall. I will consult a kitchen designer but want thoughts on my idea first.

Please don't say go open concept and remember the u doesn't have enough storage space as is.

1huhleh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1huhleh/i_gave_up_on_premium_beans_for_espresso/,I gave up on premium beans for espresso,"Title is not meant to stir controversy, I just hit the point where I made the decision for myself to reserve the premium bags, especially the more floral light roasts to pourover, because I feel like I am getting my most value for my money as pourovers from special beans.

Personally I feel like when pulling a bag that is scored at 85 or higher as a standard espresso or lungo that the nuanced presentation of the acidity and florality gets lost in that kind of beverage. Doing turbos, spros and using high extraction baskets certainly helps to bring out the flavors of these premium beans, but I am at a point where I must say that affordable (good) blends can compete with very expensive beans in standard espresso beverages (for my taste).

Chasing the godshot was fun and I definitely had memorable cups, but I have to admit to myself that I am basically setting money on fire if I am just as happy with something more affordable, especially when I find 1:2 straight shots or shorter ratios, most enjoyable.

What led to this was mostly being surprised of the quality of mainstrean Italian blends as espresso and finding out that they are not all dark roasts and oily, ashy beans. This is probably the point where people will press the downvote button for this post, but maybe this is a topic to bring up here, because a lot of solid stuff is poo-pooed here without even having tried it. Honestly writing this down feels like I am revealing some dirty secret, which in of itself is ridiculous.

I was recently surprised by my old favorite coffee Manaresi Gran Oro, how fruity and funky it is for a supermarket coffee and how good it is (and kind of un-Italian). I had a can of Illy Classico and again, I got something light bodied on the fruitier side and very enjoyable, leaning more towards medium, no oiliness. I am not turning my back against specialty coffee, still enjoying it in my V60.

  
What are your go-to beans? For those who do buy premium stuff, how do you pull it? Standard 1:2? Lungo? Even longer ratio? Milk beverage?",27,1736111892.0,espresso,23,0.91,False

*Sophie﻿﻿, Day 391*

﻿﻿The journal looked almost the same as the day I bought it. I’d imagined it battered and bloodstained, ripped at the edges and torn from the spine, but now it’s on my coffee table, as tidy as if it had spent the last year in my bedside drawer and not the back of a police station.﻿﻿﻿﻿

“What is it?” I asked the postman when he’d tried to hand over the padded envelope.

﻿﻿﻿﻿“It’s a package,” he replied curtly. “For Sophie Holloway.” Fat drops of rain bounced off the concrete around him as he shielded his eyes with his free hand, the shoulders of his highlighter-orange windbreaker slick and shiny. It had been three days without a break in the rain and five since I’d left the flat.  


﻿﻿﻿﻿“Yes, I can see it’s a package, but what’s inside? I didn’t order anything.”   
  
  
﻿﻿﻿﻿“Ma’am, I’m not sure if you’re familiar with how the postal service works, but I’m just delivering this package.” He smiled, but only with his mouth. “It’s not from me personally. I don’t know what’s inside.”﻿﻿﻿﻿  
  
  
“Right!” I shouted over a bus crashing through a puddle. “It’s just that I’m not expecting anything and my birthday isn’t for another two months.” ﻿﻿﻿﻿  
  
  
“Happy birthday!” he shouted back. “If you could just sign here I’ll be out of your way.” He pressed the envelope and a small screen into my hand before I could argue more. I scribbled down my signature and he was gone. He would’ve humoured me ten years ago, when my waist was smaller and forehead unlined.

  
My damp socks left squelching footprints across the floor. I’d spent years making the space feel like a safe one, painting the walls a non-threatening shade of robin’s egg blue and filling each nook with cushions and ceramics picked up at Saturday markets and overpriced homeware stores. Figuring I’d ordered something for the flat after a one too many lonely glasses of red, I tore into the envelope, but what I saw turned the room frigid and stale. ﻿﻿

  
The police in Lisbon had asked if I’d wanted the journal to be returned to me when they were done with it. I didn’t. I didn’t want anything connected to the trip at all. I’d binned my suitcase, never posted pictures on Instagram and when friends talked about their trips to Portugal, I stayed quiet. The memories were stuffed away in the hardest-to-reach corners of my brain, where I kept the time I pissed myself at my friend’s birthday party when I was seven, and the time I pissed myself at my friend’s birthday party when I was nineteen. I would’ve been happy for the whole story to be shredded to confetti in a dusty back office, but I needed it for Lauren.",1,1736111804.0,writers,1,0.67,False

Buying something costly like the Ceres Chill is not sustainable since I will just have to throw it out afterwards (small house, not a lot of room to store stuff). So, ideally I’d like something cheap and multifunctional like a regular cooling chest or some sort of a coffee/drink cup. Does anyone have any ideas for a cooler solution that can keep breast milk cool for around 3-7 hours max? I also have access to the fridge at work, so I can use it temporarily if need be.

I am on Vraylar 4.5 mg and Seroquel 300 mg (extended release).

Unfortunately, I'm feeling drowsy a lot, and I think it's because of it - a few days ago I made myself a cup of coffee, fell asleep at work on the desk with it, knocked the coffee over with my forehead and flooded the entire keyboard. I'm thinking about talking to my doctor to reduce the dose or switch me to other ""power limiter"", but before that I'll try to take it a bit earlier to see if it helps with drowsiness.

Hello fab Rep Girlies,

I’m on the hunt for a backpack that can handle life’s chaos—or at least my 13-inch laptop and work essentials.

Here’s the dream:

	•	Fits a 13-inch laptop like it’s giving it a cozy hug.

	•	Stylish enough that I don’t look like a lost college freshman but practical enough to survive the occasional coffee spill (don’t ask).

	•	Enough room for a charger, notebook, snacks, and the crippling weight of capitalism.

	•	Comfortable straps so my shoulders don’t feel like I owe them an apology after every commute.

Bonus points if it has:

	•	A secret pocket for snacks (or, let’s be real, stress candy).

	•	A look that says, “I have my life together,” even when I clearly don’t.

	•	Waterproofing because my boss will probably cry if my laptop doesn’t make it through the rain.


Budget? Let’s say under $300 unless this thing can also carry my emotional baggage. 

Recommendations? Funny insults? Life advice? Drop it all below. Thanks in advance!

1huhanb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1huhanb/someone_should_start_a_bakerycoffeeshop_at_the/,Someone should start a bakery/coffeeshop at the old Bugatti's location on Highway 43 in West Linn,"I just want to put this out into the ether.  Recently, Bugatti's in West Linn closed. It had been there for 30 years as I understand it. It was located on Willamette drive/highway 43. The space itself is cool but the interior design was quite dated. As far as I can tell no new tenants have signed a lease.

I have no bandwidth to do this myself but I want to encourage someone to open an awesome hip coffee shop/bakery in that space, or encourage an existing established one from Portland to open a second location there. I think there's huge untapped demand for that:

First, its no secret that West Linn is a relatively affluent suburb - it's not quite Lake Oswego but it's not too far from that. But compared to LO, West Linn is hurting for good resturants. In particular, there is no great local bakery here (and not really one in Oregon City either). But there are plenty of people with money to spend who would support a solid new place if it opened up. Particularly as traffic gets worse and worse and it becomes more of a chore to go into the city for stuff like that.

There are also a lot of people who work from home in the area. I am sure that if there was a coffee shop with a cool vibe, comfy seating and accessible laptop plugins, it would be a huge attraction for a ton people looking to get out of the house for a few hours during the workday.

Another plus is that the location is highly visible. Most people that commute into the city from WL do so via highway 43, and drive right by the old Bugatti's. Any new restaurant in that location is bound to get noticed by a ton of people and word will get out fast if the new place is good. Also, because it's right on the morning commute for many, people will probably make a quick pitstop for a morning cup of coffee.

I've noticed that recently, a couple cool Portland coffee spots (namely Roseline and Cathedral Coffee) have opened second locations in Lake Oswego and seem to be killing it. I heard from a barista at the Lake Oswego Roseline that it's become the most profitable Roseline location. Which does not surprise me. 

I really think there's a huge opportunity here, but it's going to depend on what opens in the space. I don't think it ever made sense for a family sitdown dinner type of spot but it would make a lot of sense for what I'm describing above.",9,1736111144.0,Portland,2,0.85,False
1huhamz,https://i.redd.it/koy6d5yrp8be1.jpeg,Winter Break,"I broke my 4th and 5th metatarsal on 11/26, just before Thanksgiving. While I was waiting for my surgery consult (ORIF) I made this silly dark wave album cover using my iPhone cause I thought my x-ray looked rather metal, and my mental state was not great and I needed a laugh. 

I’ve been lurking on this sub reading others’ stories and it’s helped me cope a lot, as I’ve never broken a bone before. So thanks folks for sharing your stories. Here’s mine, if it helps anyone like me who comes digging around here later. Or people who want to share in their frustrations of the US Medical system.

STORY TIME — Very long
Wish I had a cool story to tell about how I broke my foot, but no — I was simply stepping down into my recessed living room over a storage bench without using the stairs, when my foot twisted and popped under me and I hit the floor. I was in voice chat in discord with some IRL friends, so they all got to hear me hit the floor, cry out in pain, and have my partner come on abruptly to sign me off, live in real time! I was lucky that I fell to my side, narrowly missing the bench I was stepping over and our coffee table on the way down.

I’ve rolled the same foot/ankle several times in my life, so it took me a minute to figure out if that’s what I had done or if I broke it. It hurt more than I had ever felt before, and there was a sore area immediately on the outside of my foot. I heard the pop/crack as I went down, and even sitting I couldn’t put weight on it, so I was fairly convinced I had broken it. We decided to grab an ice pack and head off to the ER. Getting up the two steps out of my living room, down the one step of my porch, and down the walkway was excruciating. My good leg was dying from the hopping while clinging to our house walls and my partner for dear life. 

In incredible pain with my bad foot on the dashboard, I had an anxiety attack in the car about my job, about my partner’s job, and everything in between — I had just returned to work after a surgery in October, for which my partner used up most of their PTO. Thankfully my PTO is unlimited (within reason, I work in tech), but I was concerned about my product team as I’m training two new people and I’m the design lead on a really complex project. I thought about everything a possible broken foot implies, and my partner was trying to stay positive hoping maybe I’d just dislocated something.  

We got to the ER and I plopped into a wheelchair. It was kind of busy, they were short staffed since staff had headed off for thanksgiving holiday. Triage nurse brings me back, asks for my story, tries to get me to take deep breaths because my vitals are all over the place and I’m hyperventilating. Doc comes in for a hot minute, asks my story, says they’ll call me back to a room and get some X-rays. Promises it shouldn’t be too long. However, he doesn’t bother to ask my pain level (which was like an 8-9 easily) and sends me back out into the lobby to wait… for almost two hours. Without pain medication.

During this time, I attempted to ice my foot, and hogged extra lobby chairs to elevate it. I’ve had enough other injuries in my life to be well acquainted with RICE. I tried not to think about my pain by distracting myself with browsing the internet and updating my friends, but it was no use. In fact, funny stuff online was funnier than it should have been. I was so distressed and in pain that I kinda cracked, giggling at something dumb — then internally I joked about the meme “I’m gonna become the Joker”and just.. started laughing out loud and I couldn’t stop; and my partner was very concerned and confused.

Anyway, I finally got a room, a nurse and doc finally checked my pain level. Yay, they wanted to give me pain meds! But oh, whoops, no, I can’t have the quick acting injection because I can’t have NSAIDs (I have a platelet disorder that causes poor clotting). So they gave me some Percocet and a warm blanket (the best) and we were back to waiting for X-rays. 

After more waiting, I needed to go to the bathroom so my partner got up to try to find my wheelchair. Wouldn’t you know it, that’s when the X-ray techs came in with the mobile machine. Last time I was at this ER for COVID, they had a little skeleton guy that rode around on top of their mobile X-ray machine. I was wondering if they still did, as I appreciate me some dark humor. I wasn’t disappointed — he came rolling in dressed as Santa for the holidays. 

The techs took the X-rays while my partner waited outside with the wheelchair, and exit with little fanfare other than noting my mobility in the foot was limited while trying to take pictures. My partner came in and helped me into my chair, and as they wheeled me to the in-room bathroom, they leaned over and they were like “Yeeeeeah, your foot’s fucked.” 😂 They could see the screen as the techs were taking pictures, and told me they could see a pretty brutal break even a child could recognize. Joy.

Doc came in a bit later and confirmed I broke not one, but two bones in my foot. He told me they’d give me a referral to a podiatrist, a hard shoe so I couldn’t bend my foot, and some pain medication. I told him I can’t put weight on it, so he recommended some crutches. His attitude was overall very unbothered and I barely saw him the entire time, almost like I was not being taken that seriously. At this point I hadn’t seen my pictures but I was feeling like something isn’t right — shouldn’t I have some sort of splint or cast or at least a compression wrap? But I don’t know any better, so the nurse comes in and gets me my post-op shoe and my crutches. I asked him if I could see my own podiatrist instead of the referred one, since I have PPO insurance. He said I can do whatever I want. This, I would learn, was untrue.

11/27, the day after the break, I called my podiatrist’s office. Road block #1: They refused to see me without a referral, citing that they needed the X-rays and referral to properly triage and schedule me. So I call the hospital and ask if they can send a referral to my specific podiatrist. Road block #2: No can do, the hospital can only refer to whichever podiatrist was the designated contractor for the night I visited. So I have to see their contractor. What in the capitalist hell…?

Here’s a little context: There are only two hospitals in my city, and one is Kaiser. I avoid them like the plague and they are out of my insurance network anyway. The other hospital is in their own network but also covered by my insurance. I’ll call them Network W. My PCP and specialists are all in Network S. 

I call up the referred podiatrist, and bless them, they were able to squeeze me in. It’s the day before Thanksgiving and I was desperate to be seen since everyone will be out for four days. I went to my appointment, but nearly passed out trying to get out of my house and into the car on the crutches I’m not used to. The exertion, pain, and shock of the whole ordeal was putting my brain in opossum mode. Luckily leaning back in the car with some AC got me out of the danger zone.

Most of the surgeons were out but a PA sees me. Unfortunately she didn’t have access to the ER X-rays because their office isn’t part of Network W. They are Network H. Only a couple surgeons have access to both systems, and those guys were out. So they have to take their own X-rays. 🤦‍♀️ I told the tech the ER didn’t show me my X-rays. He was surprised and offered to show me, which is when I took the photo to make this graphic. 

PA comes in and tells me I need surgery on the 5th Metatarsal and what that entails. She’s optimistic I could have surgery the following week, until I told her I have a platelet disorder that requires premedication and coordination with a hematologist. Who is in Network S. She’s visibly concerned and left to consult with one of the surgeons who isn’t in the office. 

Road block #4: She came back and told me they aren’t comfortable doing my surgery because their outpatient facility may not be able to support what I need, and coordinating with doctors outside their network is difficult. I asked if she could give me a referral to my own podiatrist and my X-rays on a disk and she happily agreed. She was flabbergasted that ER had only given me a post-op shoe and no splint or compression bandage at all. So she and a nurse get me wrapped up with a half-cast splint and compression bandages and it helped with the pain SO much. My foot was no longer dangling and being jiggled as I crutched around.

My partner and I headed over to my podiatrist’s office to deliver the referral and the X-rays in person hoping they could see me or schedule me early the following week. Road block #5 — 1) the receptionist can’t schedule me any earlier than Jan 6 because she doesn’t have permission to make exceptions in the doc’s calendar, only her staff can do that. 2) She can’t do anything with the X-rays, I need to go to radiology to have them put those in. She tells me my podiatrist’s staff will get back to me ASAP and encourages me to message them and call them on Black Friday.

We wheeled over to Radiology (luckily in the same building) and requested they scan my CDR into the system. Road block #6: Sorry, no can do, they don’t do record scanning. CDs have to be mailed off to a contractor. I need the CD in case I have an appointment the following week, so I refuse and leave. I found out I could download my X-rays from the hospital online and do so. 

11/29 Black Friday: I had already set up a virtual appointment with my PCP about something unrelated, so I use the time to discuss my foot. She starts down the road of recommendation as if it’s no biggie and I’ll be good in 6 weeks. I asked if she looked at the X-rays because the podiatrist said I needed surgery. She can’t see any of them cause she’s Network S, and my X-rays are only in Network W and H’s systems. So I used my phone camera to show her W’s images.  At this point she nearly said “what the fuck” aloud. She told me the notes she got from the ER say that my break was “mildly displaced” and that image is anything but mild. She apologized profusely for underestimating my condition and wanted to know who the hell interpreted an image like that as “mild”. She sent an urgent referral to my podiatrist who got back to me that day. They squeezed me in for the following Tuesday. 

12/2: I saw my podiatrist who I already know and like. She was concerned about my bleeding condition and the complexities of surgery. She said maaaybe I could heal without surgery, but between her, myself, and my partner, we decided it would be better to do surgery rather than deal with a potential non-union and surgery later down the road, which would set back my entire healing timeline. My body is funny and doesn’t always heal well. 

She got me set up for surgery and I worked from home, in my bed, until my surgery date.

12/11 — I had surgery (ORIF) and everything went well. I had enough Oxy to get me through the worst of the post-op pain without NSAIDs. They put in a pin that will be taken out of my foot 6-weeks post-op. 

12/13 — My partner got laid off. When it rains it pours. I guess at least now we don’t have to worry about their PTO anymore 🙄 

12/18 — My post op wasn’t supposed to be until 12/27, but I started having excruciating searing pain on the top of  my foot every time I put my foot below my heart. Especially when trying to use crutches to go to the bathroom. This was away from the break site so I was concerned. Doc agreed to see me early and check it out. Somehow my 4th metatarsal had moved, and looked worse than the first X-rays. 5th was fine. I was very swollen and tender, just her touching the top of my foot made me cry, with some brutal bruising. My doc was concerned about a hematoma but the incision looked really good so she doesn’t want to disturb my foot too much. She opted to go with some extra compression in my bandages and gave me antibiotics just incase. Thankfully this resolved after several more days.

12/26 — While my pain was mostly manageable with Tylenol by this point, occasionally it would flare up so I would take an Oxy to get ahead of it. This night, that was a mistake. I took it with my usual nightly meds, which I could have sworn I had done before. I was feeling fine until I decided to use my knee scooter to get into the kitchen for some cake. My mom was visiting to help with some stuff and offered to get it, so I stood there chatting with her when I started to feel warm, woozy and nauseated. I was already feeling the Oxy IR when I went into the kitchen. Recognizing that I might be close to puking, I returned to my bedroom feeling increasingly uneasy. Then my gut gurgled and I grabbed my crutches to go to the bathroom. As I sat on the toilet to take a crap, I really started feeling like I was going to puke, my vision went white, and I the next thing I remember was waking up on the floor of the bathroom with my pants down and my mom and partner standing over me trying to bring me to. Luckily my shoulder took the brunt of my fall, I only slightly bonked my head. My medicines are not contraindicated with Oxy, but we suspect that because all of them can make you sleepy enough they warn you not to drive, that my usual meds, the Oxy, the heat, and my guts super combined like some sort of anti-blood pressure Voltron to deprive my brain of blood. 

12/27 — Great post-op, 4th metatarsal was back where it belonged and a callus was forming. 5th is stable and swelling had gone down a lot, no callus yet. Doc advised me not to take meds with Oxy anymore and to go to ER if I passed out again. Thankfully I haven’t needed to.

I’m now anxiously awaiting 1/17 where doc is hoping they can take the pin out and switch me to an air cast and start physical therapy. Haven’t needed any narcotics for a while. The pain is intermittent, and weirdly tingling sometimes. The effect of this whole ordeal on my mental health has been … wild and not in a good way. But I’m getting help. Even though I was already aware of accessibility concerns due to disabled family and my own fibromyalgia, it’s different when it’s your own body and you’re completely unable to get around with out assistance from mobility aids or other people. Even going to the kitchen to make coffee feels like a Herculean effort with my knee scooter. I can’t access parts of my house because of stairs or passageways that are too narrow for my scooter and crutches because it was already cluttered mess before I broke my foot. I am incredibly lucky we have a large two-person shower that fits a shower chair, and my partner can help, but it’s still an exhausting ordeal.

If you read all of this post, I hope you found it helpful or interesting in some way. If you’re also dealing with a broken foot, I wish you the speediest recovery. Happy to answer questions in the comments.",1,1736111143.0,brokenbones,0,1.0,False

Hello fab Rep Girlies,

I’m on the hunt for a backpack that can handle life’s chaos—or at least my 13-inch laptop and work essentials.

Here’s the dream:

	•	Fits a 13-inch laptop like it’s giving it a cozy hug.

	•	Stylish enough that I don’t look like a lost college freshman but practical enough to survive the occasional coffee spill (don’t ask).

	•	Enough room for a charger, notebook, snacks, and the crippling weight of capitalism.

	•	Comfortable straps so my shoulders don’t feel like I owe them an apology after every commute.


Bonus points if it has:

	•	A secret pocket for snacks (or, let’s be real, stress candy).

	•	A look that says, “I have my life together,” even when I clearly don’t.

	•	Waterproofing because my boss will probably cry if my laptop doesn’t make it through the rain.


Budget? Let’s say under $300 unless this thing can also carry my emotional baggage. 

Recommendations? Funny insults? Life advice? Drop it all below. Thanks in advance!

Mmm…? Ah, you’re awake.

Hehe… Good morning.

I finally got to say that to you at the right time.

\[fabric rustle\]

Shhh. Stay still.

You don’t have to force yourself to get up early today, remember?

\[sigh\]

This is a bad habit we need to break you out of… Or I just need to find you a workplace with a boss who isn’t a monster.

You don’t have work. You’ve still got plenty of days off, so you can stay in bed with me.

Remember?

\*\*\*

…Coffee?

You were… getting up to make us coffee?

…Us? Both of us?

\*\*\*

…Thank you, but you don’t need to do anything like that.

If you’re trying to do something nice for me, then you only need to stay here and cuddle.

Feeling your skin against mine gives me enough energy to lift a car with one hand… wait, no, that’s not right. One finger. Finger*nail*.

…Unless *you* really want coffee?

In that case, I’ll get up and get it, so you can stay warm under the blankets.

I’m the actual barista out of the two of us, after all - it’s literally my job to make sure people get the perfect coffee.

Even if I’m off the clock right now, I don’t mind doing it for you.

I can make you a whole array of coffees and complimenting snacks if you’re in an adventurous mood.

\*\*\*

It was only if I wanted some?

Then you don’t have to worry about it. Right now, I’m more interested in you.

\*\*\*

Mhm. Cuddling it is then.

Please… can we cuddle as close as possible?

\*\*\*

Thank you.Come here.

\[fabric shuffle\]

It’s so comfortable, laying my head against your chest… I can hear your heartbeat loud and clear…

Can I record it later?

\*\*\*

It’s okay. Even if it’s only the faintest sound, I’ll learn how to become a sound designer and edit it so it’s crystal clear.

Then I can listen to it over and over, to the point I’ll hear it even in my dreams… your true heartbeat, and not just my fantasy of it…

\*\*\*

\[giggles\]

Thank you so much.

\*\*\*

My plans for today?

My plans are your plans.

\*\*\*

Not at all. My plans are completely the same as yours.

I don’t have any non-you plans until you have non-me plans.

I scheduled my days off until you have to go back - I used a loophole in the rules to force my boss into not rejecting my time-off request, regardless of it being last minute.

My only plan for today - and until we’re forced apart by work - is to stay by your side as closely as possible.

And make you food and drink, make sure you’re comfy and happy, and whatever other needs you have.

Give me any request, and I’ll do it, no matter how hard or complicated. Anything goes if it’s for you.

\*\*\*

Doing all that is for myself.

Do you remember what I told you when I broke in?

Just  the sight of your smile makes my heart race.

If what I do makes you smile, then that makes it all worthwhile for me.

…Thank you for thinking of me so much today, though. It’s also making my heart flutter.

\[kiss; short pause; giggle\]

I didn’t think you’d become so red from a kiss on the collar bone.

Maybe I should make that one of my New Year’s resolutions: ‘kiss you on the collar bone until you’re used to it’.

Oh, that’s made me think of another one - ‘kiss you in new places to see your reaction’.

Are you comfortable with those?

\*\*\*

Then I’ll make sure to ask you when I want to kiss somewhere new to make sure you’re okay with it.

\[kiss\]

But cheek kisses are always okay, right?

Even if you still turn red when I give you one.

\*\*\*

Yay\~

\[kisses\]

\*\*\*

Sorry, sorry, I’ll stop.

While I do want you to rest more, you look like you’re about to pass out.

Your sleeping face is adorable, but I want to be a little selfish now you’ve let me sleep in your bed.

So please stay awake so we can keep talking. I’ll restrain myself from touching you even the slightest amount if it means I can enjoy this bed with you and talk with you for as long as you’ll allow me.

\*\*\*

Of course I need you to allow me to speak with you.

What if I spoke with you when you didn’t want to be spoken to and that annoyed you?

\*\*\*

…Are you sure?

Even if I spoke all about how much I love you and want to keep you to myself and never let anyone even think about you again… you wouldn’t be mad?

You promise?

\*\*\*

If it doesn’t make you happy being with just me… I won’t force you to stay with me… though I can’t promise I wouldn’t still make myself a part of your life.

\*\*\*

What did you mean, then?

\*\*\*

Oh, of course I’d let you keep your job and your hobbies.

But… isn’t that just the same as what I said?

\*\*\*

I didn’t think about it like that.

…Hehe. Being around me makes you happy… that makes me so, so, so happy.

\[kiss\]

Sorry. Had to give you at least one mo- mm?

\[kisses; giggles\]

You kissed me first that time, so why is your face still so red?

Though I suppose it’s lucky - if you’d had just the teensiest more confidence along with that kiss, I wouldn’t have been able to keep my hands off you.

And I don’t want to rush things… I want to savour every moment with you for as long as I can.

…Unless you want to rush things. Then I’ll go as fast as you want.

Whatever you want, I’ll make sure it’s yours.

\*\*\*

Ah… of course.

\[kiss\]

My lips will always be yours.

\[kiss\]

My cheeks, my eyes, my ears…

\[kiss\]

My neck, my shoulders, my body…

\[kiss\]

My arms, my legs, my clothes, everything I own…

\[kiss\]

This New Year, and all the years following it… every single part of me is all yours. No matter what.

I hope you’ll want to be all mine, too…

So for the past few days I have been writing the continuation of the series : 


After the fall of Samaritan, Harold Finch retires to Italy to find Grace, trying to live a peaceful life. They spend their days strolling through art galleries and enjoying quiet moments in coffee shops. However, their tranquility is shattered when Finch notices he is being watched. He brushes it off, but the unease lingers.

Meanwhile, Shaw, still operating with the Machine, gets Finch’s number. She immediately knows something is wrong. Trusting her instincts, she calls Fusco and asks for help. Though reluctant at first, Fusco agrees to join her, knowing the stakes when Finch is involved.

The two board a flight to Italy, sharing terse conversations about what could be happening. Shaw is cold and focused, while Fusco provides a dose of his usual sarcastic commentary, masking his own concerns.

In Italy, Finch and Grace are enjoying coffee when Shaw and Fusco spot them. They approach cautiously. Finch is surprised and happy to see them but immediately senses their concern. Before they can explain, a group of operatives storms the café.

The operatives grab Grace, subduing her before the team can react. Shaw and Fusco engage in a brief firefight, but the attackers escape with Grace. Finch is devastated. Shaw promises they will get Grace back, and the group sets out to track her captors.

The Machine identifies a lead. Grace is being held at a facility outside Rome, tied to a group attempting to rebuild Samaritan. Finch realizes they are using Grace to manipulate him, forcing him to contribute to their project.

The team finds the facility and infiltrates it. They fight their way through Samaritan operatives, reaching Grace. Just as they are about to escape, more operatives surround them. The team is forced to their knees, guns pointed at their heads.

As the operatives prepare to execute them, gunshots ring out. Each operative is hit in the kneecap.
And then silence.
Confused, the team looks around. John Reese steps out of the shadows, calm and collected.

Reese reveals that he has been working in secret, guided by the Machine with Root’s voice. He explains that he couldn’t reveal himself earlier, but when he got all their numbers, he knew it was time to act.

With Grace safe, the group realizes the fight isn’t over. Samaritan’s remnants are more dangerous than ever, and they must work together to stop the rise of Prometheus.

1huh7op,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1huh7op,[Routine Help],"Looking for help

TLDR:
I’ve been dealing with skin issues for years and feel like im out of options
Looking for recommendations 
Back story, routine, etc. Below

Back story
Growing up I had somewhat severe cystic acne. I frequented multiple dermatologists and was diagnosed with every condition you could imagine, rosacea, acne, eczema, seb derm, etc.
For years they had me on all different medications, oral and topical. Too many list but the longest lasting were doxycycline and tret ( I don’t remember what percentage).
Around 4 years ago my skin started to become very irritated, flaky and red and I began doing more independent research on my skin care. I stopped all actives began doing a stripped back routine of a gentle cleanser and moisturizer. The irritation subsided (I believe from years of harsh products and tret) but I would continue to break out in pustules, have flaking and be very itchy. Fast forward to late 2021, I thought I finally found a cure. My routine was 
AM: Shower no cleanser, avene tolerance extreme moisturizer (now discontinued)
PM: Vanicream Cleanser, Avene tolerance extreme, and every two days I would use a de la Cruz sulfur mask
After a few months of the best skin I had in my life, I started to get the same symptoms I had previously AND THEN my avene moisturizer got discontinued. 

CURRENTLY 
It is now 2025, im still dealing with this condition and at my wits end 
My current routine is similar to what I said above of only now avene tolerance recovery cream and a lot less of the sulfur because I find it irritating. 
Currently on my hair (for those that may suggest) I only use MooGoo shampoo every 2-3 days 
For toothpaste SLS free sensodyne 
Body wash DR bronners bar soap
I have tried countless of the above and found no change. These are the ONLY other products I use outside of my skincare.
My main concerns are the constant congestion (black heads, CCS), small pustules, cracked flaking dry skin, itchiness, flushing.

BEFORE SUGGESTING PLEASE READ
I use a new pillow case every night
I use a new towel every-time
I use a free and clear detergent 
I don’t eat dairy, processed sugar, or alcohol. I only eat gluten very rarely.
I exercise 3-5 times a week 
Drink plenty of water 
Lots of fruits veg lean meats healthy fats (EVOO, Avocado) 
One cup of coffee per day with meals
List goes on and on and on 
 
I’m really just looking for any suggestions beyond what I listed above and appreciate everyone’s time and consideration. ",2,1736110940.0,SkincareAddiction,4,1.0,False

How does this city have like 10 Starbucks locations but not a single Dutch Bros? I have to drive to Eastvale to get a good coffee? And don’t get me started on how many boba shops there are.

1huh70h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1huh70h/french_press_spaghetti_from_a_microwave_eeeyup/,"French press spaghetti from a microwave? Eee-yup, spaghetti from a microwave, using a repurposed French press!","I use an old French press filled about half way with water from my filtered tap. When its pour spout broke, it was repurposed for French press spaghetti and I have since dedicated a separate one for my coffee only. ;-)

I put the water in the MW for about five minutes until it starts boiling. Be careful: watch for ***superheating*** and ***explosive boiling,*** covered in an upcoming paragraph.

I use angel hair pasta because it's thin enough to actually cook rapidly and well. Regular spaghetti is too thick; I've had too many incompletely cooked spaghetti pasta sessions to ever go back and try it again.

After the water is heated, stand back and carefully drop a teeny piece of pasta into the water - if it's going to *explosively boil,* now is when you'll trigger it and see it. This isn't funny, it's dangerous. Don't take chances playing with this fire. It can literally disfigure faces, hands, and skin.

I'll break the pasta in half, using an old pasta bag I saved so it catches the tiny pieces the halving of the pasta creates. Already having de-flash boiled the water, I drop the half length pasta right into the French press. Use or don't use the cracked pieces as desired. *Frugality* suggests everything gets used… and I get that, but I get more satisfaction creating a faster cleanup *not having to worry about* picking at and having to clean up 200 tiny pasta pieces all over the place. Of course, YMMV.

Then the boiling, but this takes some explaining, first.

I can set the power level on my MW by choosing 20%, 30%, power settings and so on. For the uninitiated, MWs only work ALL ON or ALL OFF. So manufacturers simulate “warming” using a MW by setting what's called a “duty cycle” of 20%, or 30%, or whatever you choose. Each 10% is usually three seconds. A 30% duty cycle blasts full power for nine seconds, then shuts off for that 30-second period. It repeats itself every thirty seconds. Different manufacturers will differ slightly in their approaches.

If I choose a 30% duty cycle for four minutes, as the pasta water starts boiling, its foam will rise up and *\*ALMOST\** overflow the French press. At 20% it never comes close. At 40% or better, I guarantee I'll be making a mess of my MW.

Experiment with your setup, your degree of filtration in your water, your wattage of your MW, even the altitude you're at where you're cooking, and figure out what power level to set your MW at to get about three or four more minutes of intermittent boiling of your pasta water and pasta. Cooking.

As the water boils, the pasta gets week-kneed and slumps to the bottom of the French press.

I used to do full length pasta and I'd play the game where - as the water was coming up to its boiling temperature - I'd swirl the hot water (negligence comment: swirling hot boiling water is dangerous so don't try this at home) and watch as the pasta strands slowly dipped below the surface of the boiling water. Having full length pasta was not a big requirement for me nor a big need in my book, so I stopped using the full length strands and started breaking them in half instead. Walmart sells half length pasta in their stores.

After the boiling-cooking, set it aside for a few minutes. As the pasta sits and cooks in the near-boiling water, it expands and cooks and assimilates the water as it cooks and thickens.

When you're ready for spaghetti splendor, pour out the water - I guess you *\*could\** use your top of the French press to hold everything in, but for me that'd be overkill so I just tip it a little bit and block the opening with a fork - add your favorite spaghetti sauce, and bon appétit!

One more thing: there are a *\*LOT\** of pizza sauces that taste way better than a lot of the mass produced pasta sauces out there. Contrary to my frugal nature, even though they're a lot more expensive and it goes against my minimalist nature to buy them and use them… *I still do buy them and eat them, nonetheless!* ;-)",0,1736110896.0,Frugal,11,0.13,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------

High-speed internet is almost essential in today’s digital world; however, the cost can quickly add up. If you want to save on your internet bill, it’s time to explore cheaper options available right now. With various services and plans, there are plenty of ways to slash your internet expenses while still enjoying reliable connectivity.

### Understanding Your Internet Needs

Before you dive into finding the best deals, you should assess your internet usage. Consider asking yourself the following questions:

- How many devices are connected to your network?
- What activities do you do online? (Streaming, gaming, browsing, etc.)
- How many people use the internet simultaneously at home?

By understanding your requirements, you can better match affordable internet packages to your needs. If you're only browsing the web or checking emails, you probably don't need the fastest plan available. On the other hand, if multiple users are streaming videos or gaming at the same time, you'll want a plan that can handle higher speeds.

### Exploring Internet Service Providers

Different internet service providers (ISPs) offer varying packages, so it's essential to do a little research. Here are some tips to find an ISP that suits your budget:

- **Compare Plans:** Start by comparing plans from multiple ISPs in your area. Look at both the speed and monthly fee.
- **Promotional Offers:** Many providers have attractive introductory offers. These can significantly reduce costs in the first year but check what the rates will be after that.
- **Bundle Services:** If you also want television or phone services, consider bundling them with your internet plan. Bundles can often provide substantial savings.

### Choosing Between Types of Internet Connections

Not all internet connections are created equal, and the type you choose can impact your bill. Here’s a breakdown of common internet types:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Cable Internet:** Often provides higher speeds but may come with higher costs. Check for cheaper plans.
- **DSL Internet:** A reliable choice that is typically cheaper than cable, but it may not be as fast.
- **Fiber Optic Internet:** Offers blazing speeds but can be pricier. Look for local providers that offer competitive rates.
- **Satellite Internet:** Good for rural areas but often comes with slower speeds and higher rates. Only consider this if you don't have other options.

### Look for Government Assistance Programs

If you're struggling to afford internet service, don’t overlook government programs designed to help. Look into initiatives such as the Lifeline program, which reduces costs for low-income households. Many ISPs participate in this program, giving you the chance to cut down on your monthly bill significantly.

### Utilizing Community Resources

Check if your local community offers any low-cost internet programs. Many cities and towns have initiatives to provide affordable or even free internet access to residents. Libraries often offer free Wi-Fi and access to computers, which can help reduce your reliance on home internet for certain tasks.

### Evaluating No-Contract Options

Many ISPs offer no-contract plans, which can be a lifesaver for budget-conscious consumers. These plans typically have higher monthly payments but allow you the flexibility to change providers or plans without incurring cancellation fees. Make sure to calculate the long-term savings if u are looking for budget-friendly solutions.

### Final Thoughts for Savings

Don’t settle for an overpriced internet bill. By understanding your internet needs, comparing different ISPs, and considering alternative solutions, you can find affordable home internet options that won't break the bank. Remember to regularly review your plan and stay alert for promotions or changes in pricing. Happy surfing!

The Benefits of Bundling Services to Save on Internet Costs
-----------------------------------------------------------

Many households are looking for ways to save on monthly expenses, particularly their internet bills. One effective strategy is to bundle services. By combining different services like internet, television, and phone, you can enjoy several advantages that can lower your overall costs while enhancing your home experience.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
Firstly, bundling generally leads to lower monthly bills. Internet service providers often offer promotional packages that combine several services at a reduced rate. For example, if you were to subscribe to internet, cable TV, and home phone separately, the costs can add up quickly. However, many providers will offer discounts when you select multiple services together, making it an economical choice for families or individuals.

Safety in consistency is another critical benefit. When you bundle your services, you only have to deal with one provider for all your needs. This means dealing with one billing statement, one customer service number, and one technical support team. If something goes wrong or you need help, it’s often easier to resolve issues when everything is streamlined with one company. This can save you time and reduce the frustration of talking with multiple customer service agents.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
The convenience of a single point of contact for technical support also adds peace of mind. When something goes wrong with one of your bundled services, you won’t have to worry about which company to call. Just reach out to your provider's customer service, and they can assist you with any issues across all included services. This can be especially helpful during busy times or when you have urgent issues that need quick solutions.

Moreover, bundling can enhance your service quality. Some providers offer higher speeds and better services for bundled packages compared to standalone plans. For instance, you might find that your internet speed increases significantly when added to a cable TV plan. This is often done to maintain competitiveness and attract more customers into bundled deals.

It's also worth noting that many service providers often throw in additional perks as part of bundling. For example, you may receive a complimentary streaming platform subscription or added cloud storage for your data, which wouldn't be available with standalone services. These extras can maximize the value you get without significantly increasing your costs.

To give you a clearer picture of how much you can save, consider this typical breakdown:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Standalone Internet: $70/month
- Standalone Cable TV: $80/month
- Standalone Home Phone: $30/month
- **Total Standalone Cost: $180/month**

- Bundled Internet + Cable TV + Phone: $120/month
- **Total Bundled Cost: $120/month**
- **Total Savings: $60/month**

While the savings are crucial, it’s advisable to consider your own needs before committing to a bundle. Take a moment to evaluate your internet usage and television viewing habits. Make sure you're not paying for channels or services you don't watch or use. When choosing a bundle, opt for the one that fits your lifestyle best.

However, be wary of promotional rates that may increase after a few months. Always read the fine print to understand how long the promotional pricing lasts and what the regular rates will be. If you’re unsure, don’t hesitate to ask your provider for clarity.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
Don’t forget about competing offers from various service providers in your area. Sometimes another company might have better bundling deals or promotions. It can pay off to shop around and review options before settling for a particular bundle. Some websites can help you compare plans side by side, allowing you to make a more informed decision.

Bundling services can lead to significant cost savings, easier management of services, improved service quality, and additional perks. It's worth looking into when trying to slash those internet bills while still maintaining a high standard of service in your home.

Exploring Community Internet Programs: Accessibility and Savings
----------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s digital age, having reliable internet access is crucial. However, the cost of internet service can be a burden for many households. Fortunately, numerous community internet programs exist, making it easier for families to find affordable options. These initiatives aim to make internet access more accessible while also ensuring significant savings.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Understanding Community Internet Initiatives

Community internet programs are designed to meet the needs of local residents. They often target low-income families, seniors, and students, providing them with access to broadband services at a reduced cost. These programs can be sponsored by local governments, non-profits, or even collaborative efforts between private companies and community organizations.

### Types of Community Internet Programs

Community internet programs come in various forms, each with its own unique offerings:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Subsidized Internet Plans:** Many communities partner with internet service providers to offer discounted rates. This typically involves applying for specific programs that ensure lower monthly fees for eligible participants.
- **Geographic Hotspots:** Some organizations set up free public hotspots in community centers, libraries, and parks. This allows users to access the internet without needing a personal internet plan.
- **Digital Literacy Programs:** Alongside providing internet access, some initiatives focus on teaching residents how to use the internet effectively. This includes workshops on technology, online safety, and navigating digital resources.
- **Community Mesh Networks:** In some areas, neighbors collaborate to create a mesh network, sharing internet connection within their community. This can significantly cut costs and increase internet accessibility.

### Benefits of Community Internet Programs

Participating in a community internet program can yield several key benefits:

- **Cost Savings:** The most apparent advantage is the affordability of internet access. Many low-income households struggle to pay full price, making community options crucial for keeping expenses low.
- **Enhanced Connectivity:** As more households gain access to the internet, this fosters better communication and connection among residents. People can easily collaborate for work, school, and social activities.
- **Educational Opportunities:** Students live in a world where remote learning has become increasingly common. Community programs provide essential access to online resources, ensuring no child is left behind due to financial constraints.
- **Support Local Economy:** By encouraging internet access, communities can stimulate local innovation and entrepreneurship, allowing small businesses to flourish.

### How to Find Community Internet Programs

If you are eager to explore community internet programs in your area, consider these steps:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
1. **Research Local Resources:** Start by visiting your local government’s website or contacting community centers. Many have dedicated pages outlining available programs.
2. **Check Non-Profit Organizations:** Organizations like the National Digital Inclusion Alliance often list resources that help people find affordable internet access and digital literacy programs.
3. **Inquire with Schools:** Many schools are aware of community internet initiatives aimed at their students. Reach out to educators for recommendations.
4. **Engage on Social Media:** Join local community groups on platforms like Facebook. These groups often share information about affordable internet options and programs.

### Voicing Your Needs

For community internet programs to expand, it’s essential for residents to express their needs. Participate in local meetings, reach out to representatives, and advocate for affordable internet solutions. The more voices push for change, the more likely local governments and organizations will address access gaps.

Ultimately, community internet programs play a vital role in ensuring that everyone has access to the online world. By exploring these initiatives, you can help yourself and others enjoy not just savings but also the invaluable benefits of being connected in today’s increasingly digital landscape.

How to Negotiate Your Internet Bill for Better Rates
----------------------------------------------------

Finding ways to cut costs on your monthly expenses can greatly improve your budget. One bill that often takes a big chunk of your finances is your internet bill. If you feel like you’re paying too much for internet service, you might be in a good position to negotiate a better rate. Here’s how you can tackle this challenge effectively.

### Know Your Current Plan

Before you start negotiating, it’s essential to understand what you currently have. Check your internet plan details, including:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Speed of your internet connection
- Monthly cost
- Contract length
- Additional fees

This preparation allows you to speak confidently about your service and what you’re entitled to as a customer.

### Research Competitors

Gather information on what other internet providers in your area offer. Look for:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Promotional rates and packages
- Customer reviews
- Service speed and reputation

Knowing what competitors offer gives you leverage in negotiations. You can use this information to argue why you deserve a better deal.

### Choose the Right Time to Call

The timing of your call can make a difference. Aim to call during off-peak hours when customer service representatives are less busy. This can help ensure you receive attentive service. Additionally, consider calling on a weekday rather than the weekend. You'll likely have a better experience when they can dedicate more time to your request.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Be Polite but Firm

When you finally connect with a representative, maintain a professional and friendly tone. Start the conversation by expressing your appreciation for their service. Then, make it clear that you’re experiencing the financial burden of your current rate.

For instance, say something like: “I love the service, but I’ve noticed my bill has increased, and I can no longer afford it. What can we do to lower it?” This approach opens the door to negotiation without sounding confrontational.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Present Your Research

Now it’s time to leverage the information you gathered. Discuss your findings about competitors and share how their offers appeal to you. A statement such as:

“I see that Company X is offering a similar plan for $20 less than what I’m currently paying,” can be very effective.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
This shows them that you’ve done your homework and are serious about finding a better deal.

### Ask About Promotions and Discounts

Internet providers regularly have promotions or discounts available for new customers, but they often forget to extend these to existing customers. Don’t hesitate to ask:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Are there any promotions I’m eligible for?
- Do you offer any loyalty discounts?
- Can you waive any additional fees or charges?

Your inquiry might reveal discounts you weren’t aware of, reducing your bill significantly.

### Be Prepared to Walk Away

If they don’t budge on your request, be ready to walk away. This is a powerful negotiating tactic. Express your disappointment and mention that you may consider switching to a competitor. Companies often want to keep their customers, and your threat to leave can prompt them to find a way to keep you.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Follow Up

If the first call doesn’t yield the results you want, don’t be discouraged. You can always follow up or speak to a different representative. Sometimes, persistence can pay off! Make notes during your calls so you can refer to them if you need to escalate your request.

Negotiating your internet bill may seem daunting at first, but with the right approach, you can achieve a better rate. Equip yourself with knowledge about your current plan and competitor pricing, and don’t shy away from asking for what you deserve. Improving your internet costs will free up cash for other important areas in your budget.

The Rise of Mobile Hotspots: An Alternative to Traditional Internet Plans
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, mobile hotspots have gained popularity as effective alternatives to traditional internet plans. With the advancement of technology and a growing reliance on internet connectivity, many individuals and families are looking for flexible options that better suit their needs. Understanding how mobile hotspots work and their advantages can help you make a knowledgeable decision for your connectivity requirements.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### The Basics of Mobile Hotspots

A mobile hotspot is a portable device that allows users to access the internet wirelessly through cellular networks. By tapping into data from cellular carriers, mobile hotspots create a Wi-Fi network that can be shared with multiple devices. These devices are often compact and battery-powered, making them convenient for home use or while on the go.

### Why Consider Mobile Hotspots?

There are several reasons why mobile hotspots may be a viable alternative to traditional internet plans:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Flexibility:** Mobile hotspots provide unmatched flexibility. You can take them anywhere, making it easy to stay connected while traveling, camping, or working remotely.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Many mobile hotspot plans are more affordable than conventional internet services. You can choose from various pay-as-you-go options, allowing you to pay only for what you need.
- **No Contracts:** Most traditional internet services require long-term contracts. Hotspot plans typically offer month-to-month subscriptions, giving you the ability to switch or cancel at any time.
- **Easy Setup:** Setting up a mobile hotspot is quick and easy. Unlike traditional broadband connections, which may require professional installation, a mobile hotspot can be set up within minutes.
- **Portable Connectivity:** Whether you’re commuting, on vacation, or working from a café, being able to access the internet through a mobile hotspot brings portability to your online experience.

### Choosing the Right Mobile Hotspot Plan

With so many options available, selecting the right mobile hotspot plan can feel overwhelming. Here are some tips to help you choose the best plan for your needs:

- **Understand Your Data Usage:** Estimate how much data you typically use each month. This will help you select a plan that meets your internet needs without overspending.
- **Compare Coverage:** Different carriers offer varying levels of coverage. Ensure that the mobile hotspot provider you choose has reliable coverage in your area to avoid interruptions in service.
- **Evaluate Speed:** Look into the speeds offered by different plans. Some hotspot plans may cap your speed after reaching a certain data threshold, so review the fine print carefully.
- **Assess Device Compatibility:** Ensure that your devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) can connect easily to the mobile hotspot you choose. Compatibility will affect your overall experience.
- **Look for Additional Features:** Some mobile hotspots come with extra features, such as connection security, the ability to connect multiple devices, or even built-in battery sharing capabilities.

### Real-Life Applications of Mobile Hotspots

Mobile hotspots can be beneficial in numerous scenarios. Consider the following examples:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Travel:** If you frequently travel for work or leisure, a mobile hotspot allows you to have reliable internet access wherever you go. This can improve your ability to stay on top of emails and manage work tasks while away from home.
- **Students:** For students who need to complete homework or attend online classes, mobile hotspots can ensure they remain connected, especially if they lack reliable home internet. This is particularly important for remote learning.
- **Emergency Situations:** In the case of power outages or natural disasters, traditional internet services may become unavailable. A mobile hotspot can serve as a dependable backup option.
- **Remote Work:** With the rise of remote work culture, having a mobile hotspot allows professionals to work from an array of environments, such as coffee shops, parks, or during travel.

While traditional internet plans have served homes for decades, mobile hotspots offer an appealing alternative that caters to the modern lifestyle. With their flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, mobile hotspots provide a practical solution for anyone looking to stay connected in today’s ever-changing digital landscape. If you’re considering an upgrade or a switch, take the time to explore your options, and you may just discover the perfect internet solution for your needs.

### Conclusion

By exploring various strategies to slash your internet bill, you can discover a world of affordable home internet options tailored to your needs. Bundling services not only simplifies your monthly expenses but can also yield significant savings on your internet costs. Whether you choose to pair your internet with cable or phone services, the combination often comes with attractive discounts.

Community internet programs offer another pathway to accessibility and savings. These initiatives support underserved areas and provide affordable plans that can dramatically reduce your internet expenses. If such options are available in your locality, they can be a game-changer for your budget.

I am looking to produce a series of ambient tracks for a game I’m producing. Think 80s/90s light techno with a heavy ambient leaning. I like the idea of recording samples and mangling them, using granular and reverb and delay etc but also having the option to use a sequencer to “pulse” the sound to create the rhythm. Not sure of that makes sense.

I could use software but I spend 12 hours a day on a laptop so when I get to make this music it’ll be in coffee shops, the train, the beach etc.

 I don’t need to record onto the device, that would be a plus. I’d record long piano samples or take output from my tiny Eurorack setup and then want to use this device to add the structure/rhythm. So an ambient looping track will slowly from in urgency. This would then be triggered depending how far you get in the game with a simple sample switch.

I was not a fan of trackers on computers, but I wonder if it’ll feel different on custom hardware. I love Elektron sequencers but portability is key.

To break the tension Axelia spoke up, “Next time I should probably eat before I go to training, I got excited with the new outfit and lost track of time.” Cratus rolled his eyes, “Don't worry, great power comes with great appetite, you'll start to notice that your small human routines will not be enough here!” Cratus threw a flask to her chest, “This is ambrosia, drink it, it should help you, might feel a bit silly after your first drink“Clinching the flask Axelia tipped it back and took a big swig. It tasted like honey on a perfect winter day, smooth and crisp, so refreshing it knocked her back a bit. But the warmth and tingle she felt the second it hit her was like nothing she had ever felt before. The light around her grew much brighter, and the hairs on the back of her neck stood up with the intensity of chills. After dinner, Axelia took a walk in the field of roses by her cabin before heading inside. Thinking about how far she had come in just a few days, she wanted to take in every moment, every feeling, “whoa” she said out loud to herself, her body suddenly relaxed and as she fell through the roses, unconscious and weak. Her body to shut down as it prepared for a big change. The next morning, she woke up in her bed tucked into her sheets. She expected an intense amount of soreness when she went to place her feet on the wood flooring, but to her discovery, she was not sore. But her body felt heavier, her mind pounded and ached as she slowly got ready and buckled up the armor. She made her way to the kitchen to get a fresh cup of coffee from her secret stash Tate left her, she wasn't sure of what to do but knew she was eager to get back to the fields.  When she got down to the kitchen, she noticed Tate was already there sitting by the window. “Good Morning,” Axelia said with a smile, “Morning, hope you’re feeling well, I found you passed out in the roses last night. Figured you would be more comfortable in your bed, what happened?” As he said that Axelia ran her hand across her arms feeling what was left of the scabs from the fall. “I don’t remember what happened, I must have been weak from yesterday. I did some personal training and ran into Cratus. Not sure how long I was out there before I got extremely weak. Oh, I got to try Ambrosia for the first time! maybe that was it” The last thing she remembered was meeting Cratus, her father, and having Ambrosia at the dining hall. Axelia shrugged it off and joined him for coffee, they sat on the porch, enjoying the sun rising on the shore. “Axelia it definitely sounds like you got a little overworked and then got an extreme amount of power dosed back into your body. Its like the body is trying to transition into this really powerful being, with a very tiny access point.”  **She spent the next few days training on the battlefields with Athena and Ares. Spending her evenings at the cabin of Asclepius for healing. She hoped to gather as much information as she could from any of the Gods. Each day Axelia grew stronger, smarter, and much wiser. She endured hours of training every day. Hearing stories of the old days. The longer she was there the more real Olympus felt, and the more she realized that the mortal world wasn’t so real after all.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interest you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

Still naked I took their breakfast up to them, knocked on the door and enterd when I was called. I tried not to look at them but it was impossible, I was too weak not to. She was under the covers, half way don't his body between his legs while he lay there, hands behind is head grinning at me. 

I paced the tray on the dresser and feeling stupid and more pathetic than ever asked.

""Is there anything else I can get you""?
He gave my question a snort of derision and ignored me, when from under the covers came. 

""Just fucking go get our money you fucking idiot"". 

Without thinking, once again I thanked them before leaving the bedroom.  As I was dressing the reality of my situation hit me, I was willingly going to give them £150 each so she would let me suck their 'sex mess' from the bed sheets. It was my bed, in my house and they were my sheets!  But without her it would be just my dull ordinary existence, with her I was in submissive heaven! So I wouldn't or couldn't stop myself. I wanted and needed the shame and humiliation. 

I loved her with all my heart.

She had reduced me to a desperate new low, once more the wave of shame swept over me, paying her to let me perform the most  humiliating and degrading acts, and the worst thing about it was that I desperately wanted it! 
Once dressed I drove to the nearest ATM and withdrew the money she demanded, I don't know why but I got an extra £100 to give her, I so desperately wanted to show her my devotion to her, to pleasing her. 

When I got back they were both already downstairs in the kitchen drinking coffee. I immediately took the money she'd demanded and offered it over to her.  She looked me up and down and with a faux puzzled expression on her face asked..

""Why the fuck are you standing?  Is my little piggy bank trying to act like a real man""?  

I dropped to my knees and apologised for standing, telling her I would never stand without permission in her presence. 
As she took the money she patted me on my head. 

""That's a good little piggy bank, you're stupid but you're learning"". 

I was so conditioned in my inferiority to her that this obvious act of ridicule made me feel so happy and proud. 
She counted the money as I looked up from my knees, in eager anticipation of her reaction to the extra I had given her.

 She counted it out loud and as she passed £300 I looked up her hopeful of her reaction.  Nothing!  She just counted on until £400. 

""Silly me I thought I'd said £300, must have said 4"". 

Devastated at her lack of appreciation I let out a little sob as my head dropped. 
Reaching out and grabbing my hair she dragged me upright on my knees. 

""You fucking disrespectful old bastard""! 

A savage slap to the side of my face
 followed her angry words.

""Don't you ever think that you can buy your way into my favor. I can take as much money from you as I fucking well like, whenever I like, the only way you can show me that you deserve my attention is by your total and absolute obedience to me, by showing me how much you're willing to suffer for my fun. You disgusting piece of subhuman shit"". 

I was literally crying as I apologised to her. On the ground at here feet begging for her forgiveness. 
The sound of their laughter crushing my self-esteem further.

""Owww, poor piggy bank, does the truth hurt it's feelings"". 

She was obviously enjoying the emotional pain her cruelty inflicted on me.  I watched as she picked up a bowl from the table.

""Don't be sad little piggy, we've saved you some breakfast""! 

Making it sound as thought they'd gone out of there way to do something special for me rather than just giving me their leftovers. 

As she put the bowl on the floor they both laughed. Looking at the contents of my ""breakfast bowl"" the reason for their amusement became all too clear.
In the bowl was a sloppy mixture of bits they hadn't eaten. 

Tea, coffee, orange juice, toast, and jam. Just dumped in a bowl. 

I looked at the mess and looked up at her. She was radiant, glowing with joy, the joy of degrading and humiliating me! 
I knew then that whatever she said to me, or did to me, or made me do to myself, whatever she wanted I would do, I would do anything to please her.

I loved her so much.

I would like to share my recent experience, however, i am not sure if it was lucid dreaming or not.

Recently I returned to my previous company that I work, in the retail wholesale market. They work  3-shift rotation with night shift as well. However, I was only assigned the night shift now in December and start of January. Recently the job became stressful as some experienced colleagues have left. The last month i have doubled my caffeine intake with coffee and energy drinks in night shift and started ocasionaly smoking.

haveWhich i never did before. The work environment is additionally stressful because it is in cold storage room, and you can easily become dehydrated because of the ventilated air. This has reflected to my experience I have experienced today, that i never had before. Before I slept at night, and drank coffee and energy drink, but could not fell asleep and was awake till 4 AM. Then i woke up at around 8AM and drank another coffee. Then crash came in and I took a nap, with putting headphones to a classical music mix. . What I experience was the deepest REM sleep for 2 hours i have experienced. I tried to wake up at around 12PM, but simply my body could not. I have woken up, but what i ended up was in my dream, where i was in my apartment, and in the background was the classical music that I had left on, and was aware of it. I tried to go to the hallway and i was getting like i was going to work, and tried to exit out. However when i went out i woke up again, and was again in the same spot. This has happened maybe 10x times, and felt like i had chained arms and could not put headphones off my ears and wake up. It was like a constant glitch or loop of me running outside of my apartment, but could not escape. It was the routine i had for the work past 5 months, where I was basically like a robot with the same routines. the exit of apartment maybe also reflected my desire to escape the repetitive job that I currently have which I am really dissatisfied, but have to stay for now.

This experience was very interesting how this routine, lack of sleep, and caffeine led me to this unique state of mind, with classical music soothing everything up and putting me into deep state of rem sleep with only 2 hors of sleep.

1hugvsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/tall/comments/1hugvsb/what_are_your_tall_people_hackshot_tipstricks/,What are your Tall people hacks/hot tips/tricks?,"As a tall person, there are a few things I've learned in my life that have helped me as a tall person. Things I incorporate into daily life, tools or devices that help me particularly with my height, or tricks to making life simpler or easier based on my height. I'll name a couple and would love for you to submit yours? I know we get various things like this but I would love to make a tall person's guide to life for this sub with a collection of tips from here:

Items I own that help make life easier:
- shower head extender and waterfall type showerhead to turn any nose-level shower into motel luxury shower. I added 2 - 8"" stainless steel extensions from Amazon. East to do with no plumbing experience needed
- long handled shower brush - buy a wood one with natural fiber bristles and they can last years and years. and now you can scrub the middle of your back and don't have to bend down as far in the shower to scrub your legs 


Clothes: 

- find out what sizes truly fit you comfortable and that look nice in your opinion, then find any place within a couple hrs that sell your size. It's always nice to find a place to try on in person if possible. LL Bean and Tractor Supply both carry XL Talls and L Talls and talls regularly, along with larger sizes too. Western pattern button downs, hoodies, etc. They also carry nice wrangler jeans that have larger sizes in length and width at TSC 

- shoes - oddball shoes or Zappos. Zappos 
has free returns so If you buy with a credit card you can order a few and then just immediately return. I see 15-16 men's and various widths on Zappos frequently. New balance and Nikes for sneakers heads. 

- apps like depop and Poshmark are easily searchable but usually don't have a Talls seperation but I have saved searches for the word talk and XLT. This is how to find vintage and interesting pieces. Usually very affordable to cheap too. 

- if your feet are like 14 and smaller, Costco has great priced wool socks in XL
- if you have bigger than that feet, darn tuff has larger sizes in their work wear line (the black and gray socks on their website). They aren't cheap but 20-30 a pair for socks that will last many years is kinda what it costs. Even buying one a pair as a Christmas gift to yourself or a friend is basically an investment. 

Home decorating

 - place mirrors so you can see your whole head and it sits just below the top of the mirror. . Try to have a full length or tall upright. Mirror so partners can also see themselves too.

- for Feng shui and flow within your home, make sure your walking paths through the home are wide enough to comfortably get through without bumping anything with your elbows or knees or shoulders or head. If it is comfortable for you and wide enough, others smaller than you will feel even more comfortable in your space and it may even feel spacious to them in comparison, which feels nice. 

- Keep things at or below eye Level for the most part. Being tall, it can sometimes feel claustrophobic if there are low ceilings and there is stuff in your face. The only things at face level in my place are book shelves and vinyl record shelving that i actively peruse and dont want to bend down to 

- place your tv and any speakers are viewing height. Get that TV off the mantle or wall and on a nice low TV stand ao that your eyes falls to the center of the TV and your ears are at the speaker height when you are sitting on your couch or listening/TV watching seating position. If you have partner or roommates using the space too, place TV and speakers somewhere between your eyes levels. Tvs mounted higher than your eye Level means you will always be looking up and increased neck tension and pain is not ideal. 

- buy sturdy furniture. I break things as a taller person that weights A bit and doesn't think about it enough. Solid wood stuff is ideal. Antique and vintage furniture is often well built, very solid, and you can get them often for low cost on Facebook marketplace or reuse and thrift stores. Goodwill and volunteers of America are my go to. 

- the only things that go on the floor are furniture. Don't put your bags on the floor when you arrive. Have a chair, sofa 
, table, closet, whatever your drop spot is, have a designated spot to put it. Everything should have a place in your home. And that place isn't the floor. Will help keep your home clean, reduce clutter, but more importantly, keeps shit out of the way so you don't trip on it. My feet are already huge. Don't need stuff in my footpaths. 
- tall, skinny plants and long hanging plants can make a space feel taller. Also as a tall person, it's not hard for me to water hanging pots at my head height or above, so I can get away with placing pots high and I can wrangle bigger pots on my floor a bit easier than the average person too. A tall palm in a corner by a window and a hanging pothos or spider plant on a decorative plant hanger hanging from a brass hook in the ceiling or a wrought iron wall mount hanger does a lot. Adds color. Dimension. Life. And decoration. 
- for desks, I like to suggest adjustable height desks for everyone of any height. Being able to stand or sit is great for everyone. I recommend the husky adjustable height workbench as a non electric hand adjustable work table or desk. Solid, wood top, simple, can use it when power is out or off-grid. I suggest the ones without drawers unless it's actually used as a work bench, because they get in the way of your knees otherwise when sitting underneath it. The drawers are really nice, but they add too much height between the top of your lap and the top of the desk. 
- platform beds for the win. No need for a box spring, springs are bad for our backs anyway, and most platform beds dont have foot boards. Organic latex foam mattresses if you can swing it. 
- hang instruments or cameras or whatever hobby things you use regularly with a wall mount or shelf in a place you can easily reach. Because you're tall , you can hang higher than most without any issues, so it increases your options of hanging locations. A guitar on the wall with a headstock hanger or a camera shelf or hanging hook to make your hobby a walll decorative centerpiece is cool and gets stuff off the floor and makes more room. 
- hanging lamps or tall floor lamps or vintage tension lamps can really Add dimension, reduce amount of needed furniture (don't need a table for a table lamp anymore, or makes room on the table when you don't have a lamp on it) and increase decorative or functional lighting. Point one at your turntable. One to light your coffee table area, one for dining, one for reading.

1hugvc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hugvc0/americans_in_movies_drink_too_much_water_and_its/,"Americans in movies drink too much water, and it’s all bottled water propaganda","Have you ever noticed how American movies have turned hydration into a full-blown obsession? Every protagonist has a bottle of water glued to their hand like it’s a magical talisman against bad decisions. Whether they’re running from explosions, solving murders, or just having a deep, introspective conversation, there’s *always* a bottle of water in the scene.

Coincidence? I think not.

Let’s talk numbers. According to Hollywood, the average American drinks about 27 gallons of water *per scene.* Meanwhile, the rest of us in the real world are lucky if we remember to sip our coffee before it gets cold. And don’t even get me started on the *brand placement*. Oh, look, another slow-motion shot of a glistening plastic bottle with the logo perfectly angled toward the camera. Subtle.

But here’s the kicker: I’m pretty sure the bottled water industry is *behind this*. Think about it. They’ve infiltrated Hollywood, turning every action hero into a hydration role model. These movies aren’t just entertainment; they’re *hydration propaganda*. Why else would a rom-com protagonist bring a water bottle to their therapy session? Or a villain pause mid-monologue to take a delicate sip of artisan spring water?

And it’s not just the quantity...it’s the *timing*. Characters always chug water right before something dramatic happens. Are they trying to tell us that the key to surviving a car chase is preemptive hydration? Are we supposed to believe that the only thing keeping the world safe from aliens is a well-timed electrolyte boost?

Meanwhile, European movies have people surviving entire plots on nothing but espresso and existential dread. No one’s running around Paris clutching a BPA-free water bottle like their life depends on it.

So, next time you watch an American blockbuster, pay attention. Spot the bottles. Count the sips. Connect the dots. Because it’s not just hydration—it’s capitalism, baby. And don’t let Hollywood guilt you into drinking eight glasses a day. You’re fine. Probably.",0,1736110099.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,13,0.22,False

I heard/felt everything lock into place as it’s supposed to. I tried to finish brewing my coffee, and the pump failed to pull any water into the machine. It whirred briefly but the “pump engage” sound never kicked on. It has not worked since then. The internet seems to point to an “air lock” in the line to the pump. 

I have tried the following:

- wiggling/jostling the carafe

- running a rinse cycle

- hot water in the carafe 

- using a long straw to try and blow air into the pump intake and dislodge the air lock while running a brew cycle, with a full carafe

- using said straw directly on the pump intake, carafe removed

- cleaning the pokey things that pierce the pods, with a toothpick 

- cleaning the entire pod mechanism with a toothpick


Pump never engages, no water is ever drawn into the machine. No water runs through the machine or comes out.

Tagging 

According to conversations with Ouras AI Advisor, oura does not take the quantity nor the time of a tag into account. It therefore sees no difference if I tag coffee once in the morning or 20 times before bed, which makes it quite inaccurate in my opinion. 

The next aspect: since time doesn’t matter I’ve simply started to add the applicable tags for the day in the evening as this is more efficient. I therefore go through the Tag list and see which ones apply for my day. Oura gives you a plethora of premade tags. Some may apply, some may not. Since I am a guy I don’t really think of „vaginal dryness“ to be a factor to my wellbeing. For some reason though, I am unable to delete this tag even though I will never use it.


Analysis 

What I find truly misleading: I remember that in advertising they talk all about about how you can find out which of your lifestyle behaviors affect your health in which way. This is very hypocritical, since oura does not do any discovery analyses for self made tags. So yes I may find which lifestyle behaviors affect my health, but only the ones oura decides are worthy to be preinstalled. The only „analysis“ I could do with self made tags is that I look at the graph of health parameters and Eyeball/guesstimate wether the self made tag „Overnight Travel“ has an effect or not. This once again is hypocritical and in conflict with their advertising. Especially since I can’t export these tags and parameters (see below)

Additionally, once a discovery has been made I find no way of getting an overview over all my discoveries. So let’s say that on the 20th of March I get the notification that Coffee increases my resting heart rate. Short of writing that fact down, I will never find it again.

Lastly (this may be a bit on the geeky side of things) oura does not let you export your tags and health parameters. Why do I want to Export them? I would like to run them through an ANOVA or similar computation to rule out any confounding variables and find my own discoveries. The fact that oura does not let you do this, is a bit suspicious in my opinion. Especially considering that they are broadcasting that they work closely with science and encourage member self-experiments.

TLDR: Oura lacks in the department of analyzing self made tags, organizing premade ones, overview of discoveries and exporting of raw data.

Online Presence: Ditch has been active online, particularly on platforms like YouTube under names like ""My Autism Life Story - Andrew D"" and other related channels. He claims to be on the autism spectrum, though this has been disputed by medical documentation. His online activities have included weather forecasting for Buffalo, New York, and sharing personal life stories, including controversial behaviors and claims.




Public Records and Personal Life: Public records indicate he resides at (removed address), Tonawanda, NY, with other family members. There have been multiple reports of his behavior causing distress to his family, including an incident where he allegedly used an oil diffuser to trigger his mother's breathing issues.

I’m flexible on location as long as it’s within a reasonable commute to Westchester and has a safe, walkable neighborhood. If we find a larger house, we could potentially have more than two roommates, but I’m aiming for a cozy and manageable setup.

1hugj8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Volvo/comments/1hugj8h/volvo_ex30_when_a_car_exceeds_your_expectations/,Volvo EX30: When a Car Exceeds Your Expectations!,"TL;DR at the end

Hey everyone! I recently received my Volvo EX30 Twin Motor (black with mist interior) and have driven it for about 500km. I felt compelled to write this review because many others haven’t captured my personal experience. This is my first EV and second Volvo. For context, I’ve driven BMWs, Mercedes, Teslas, and Toyotas, among others. My last car was a 2023 Hybrid, and when shopping for the EX30, I debated between it, the Model Y, and the Cadillac Lyriq. Spoiler: the EX30 exceeded my expectations in nearly every way. Let’s dive in!

\---

What I Hate

\- Key System:  

  Using the key card in freezing Canadian winters (-15°C) is frustrating. My wife has the fob, and getting another costs $500—a steep price. This leaves me relying on the key card, which is less convenient. Every time I have to dig it out of my pocket, it’s a small reminder of why I’m eagerly waiting for Digital Key Plus.

\---

What I Love

\- Driving Comfort:

  I cannot overstate how comfortable this car is. It glides over Quebec’s infamously pothole-ridden roads effortlessly, making me forget how rough the terrain actually is. The suspension feels incredibly refined, absorbing bumps and dips like no other car I’ve driven—including luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes. It’s not just smooth—it’s unexpectedly luxurious for a car in this price range. Every drive has been a delight, and I find myself looking for reasons to take it out on the road.

\- Infotainment:

  I’m not a fan of all-digital dashboards, but I’ve come to accept that this is the future. That said, the EX30’s system is leagues ahead of anything I’ve used before. Compared to my old XC40, the infotainment is vastly improved—faster, more intuitive, and far more reliable. It even rivals Tesla’s system, which is a high bar.  

  While it isn’t perfect (e.g., the steering wheel heat turning on by itself occasionally), these bugs are minor and manageable. As a software developer, I appreciate that these issues can be addressed through OTA updates rather than requiring a trip to the dealer. Also, compared to German cars, whose infotainment systems are notoriously clunky and unreliable, this feels like a significant step forward.

\- Build Quality:

  I was nervous about taking delivery after reading horror stories online, but my experience couldn’t have been more different. The car feels solid and premium. Yes, it’s minimalist (or ""sustainable,"" depending on your perspective), but it doesn’t feel cheap or stripped-down. I’d say it’s on par with luxury German brands and certainly better than Tesla in terms of build quality. For those who value clean, modern interiors, this car is a pleasure to sit in.

\---

Other Tidbits

1. Storage & Size

   The interior storage is a mixed bag. While there’s plenty of space up front, the middle section is less practical. Items can move around during drives because there isn’t enough secure, closed storage. It’s not a dealbreaker, but compared to my XC40, I find myself missing more secure compartments.  

   The front seats feel spacious, and the cabin doesn’t feel like a “small car.” However, the back seats are understandably tighter—it’s a subcompact SUV, after all. At 180cm tall, I can sit comfortably in the back for shorter trips. For longer drives, though, anyone my height would likely need a stretch during charging breaks. Manage your expectations here: this isn’t a Rivian R1S or a Model Y in terms of interior space, but it’s perfectly adequate for what it is.

2. Range

   I don’t stress about kilometers remaining—I focus solely on the battery percentage, and it’s been liberating. My approach is simple: for city driving, I charge when the battery hits 60%; for road trips, I recharge at 35%. This way, I never have to worry about “how far I can go.”  

   Charging has been seamless, even though I’m still waiting to install my home charger. Public chargers have been reliable, and I usually take a 10–15 minute break to grab coffee or use the restroom while charging. Living in an area with plenty of charging stations nearby (both fast and regular) makes range anxiety non-existent for me. Honestly, this has been a smoother experience than I anticipated, and it’s made me question why I didn’t switch to an EV sooner.

3. Safety Features:

   The car’s sensors are incredibly active—they beep at the slightest distraction. While it can feel excessive at times, I’ve come to appreciate the extra layer of safety. Whether it’s warning me about a potential hazard or alerting me when I’m not paying attention, these features enhance my peace of mind. Like the infotainment system, there are some minor quirks, but nothing deal-breaking. For instance, occasional sensor bugs are par for the course in modern cars, and the EX30’s issues are far less egregious than those I’ve experienced in other vehicles.

Overall Impression:

This car is perfect for my lifestyle. It’s just my wife and me, with the occasional friend or two riding along. For that use case, it’s ideal. It can comfortably accommodate four adults or a family with two adults and a couple of kids.  

I think some of the complaints online are exaggerated. All-digital cars will have bugs—it’s the nature of the beast. However, the ones I’ve encountered in the EX30 are minor, not dangerous, and easily fixable. The overall experience is so positive that these small issues barely register for me.  

Do I Recommend It?

Without hesitation, yes! At this price point, the EX30’s high-end trim offers a combination of comfort, technology, and build quality that’s unmatched. If you’re on the fence, don’t rely solely on what you read online—take it for a test drive and see how it fits into your day-to-day life.

TL;DR

The Volvo EX30 Twin Motor is a standout subcompact SUV. It’s incredibly comfortable, with a premium feel and a surprisingly smooth ride. Forget obsessing over range—I just track battery percentage and never worry about distance. There are minor quirks (e.g., bugs in the key system and infotainment), but nothing major. For couples, small families, or city drivers, it’s a perfect blend of practicality and luxury at an unbeatable price. 🚗💨",14,1736109249.0,Volvo,0,0.9,False

I (23F) have been dating my bf (23M) for almost two years now. For context, I live with him at his place, since I do not feel safe at the apartment I am paying rent for. My roommate is a little… unhinged, to put it lightly. I work full-time at a daycare while doing school online for my Masters. He is a full-time undergraduate student. He used to work part-time as a server but now tutors online. At least I think he does; as far as I am aware, he hasn’t tutored since about a month ago, and even then, he was only tutoring three times a week. I can’t complain too much since I don’t pay rent for his apartment, but I basically provide everything else for us as far as food, edibles, dates, etc go. 

Most of our relationship is very good, and I am generally happy. However, his unreliability has been irking me a lot lately. Typically, I try to communicate these kinds of things to him, as we both prioritize open communication. But I have discussed this with him numerous times before and it just feels like nothing is changing. I feel like he doesn’t appreciate or value my time.

I’ll start off with what led me here. On Friday, we had a New Year’s party with our close group of mutual friends (6 people total, including me and my bf). The party started at 6pm and I left work at 5pm. Since I knew I wouldn’t have a lot of time to party prep, I asked him to do a couple things. He is ASD so I try really hard to provide itemized lists since that helps him know what needs to be done. I copy-pasted the list:

* Clean up main room
* Put away drying rack dishes
* Wash dirty dishes
* Make 4 cups of rice at 3:30-
4:00pm
* Cut up carrots and cucumber into long (3-4""), thin slices

Since he never leaves the apartment (he stays home all day,) I truly did not think this is an unreasonable number of things to do. I would have done it myself, had I not been at work. On my end, I bought a bunch of ingredients we would need for the party during my lunch break. (Miraculously, I somehow managed to complete it all!) 

Anyway… lo and behold, when I got home, the veggies had not been prepped and the main area had not been vacuumed, coffee table had not been cleaned, and even the blankets had not been folded. To his credit, he cooked the rice perfectly and did the dishes. 

Guests arrived at 6pm, and I was cooking (it was a potluck) until 7:30pm. In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have made sushi but I love my friends and food is my love language haha. 

Later, I finally got to hang out with our friends. One of our friends ended up passing out on the couch and we all hung out the following day (Saturday.) Skip to meal-time. While bf and friends (another mutual ended up swinging by to get her car, since she had been too intoxicated to drive the night before) were hanging out, I (unsurprisingly) was doing the dishes.
This is not unusual, so it didn’t upset me since I don’t necessarily mind doing dishes.

Last night, we said bye to our friends and then went to bed, as it was already 2am. Or at least I went to bed. He stayed up all night gaming and surprise, surprise is now asleep from being up all night. I asked him this morning is he was up all night and he confirmed. I expressed my disappointment, since I have to go to work tomorrow. To me, my weekends are valuable and so I like to spend them with my BF, as we really don’t get as much time together we used to, when I was also an undergraduate student. He said he wouldn’t fall asleep since he also wanted to spend the day with me. You don’t have to be Einstein to guess exactly what happened next. He fell asleep. So, I got out of bed, and spent three hours cleaning the entire apartment while he was asleep. 
That was all this weekend. 

On top of all of this, I also feel like he is unreliable because he is notoriously bad with timing. We used to hang out on my lunch breaks, but we eventually cancelled those since he had a habit of showing up 20 minutes late, leaving me confused. It would have been one thing if he at least told me he would be running late, but no. Nothing. 20 minutes is a substantial part of my lunch breaks, and at that point, given no communication, half the time I assumed he was sleeping and would thus not show up at all. He tends to sleep in until I call him to wake him up at 1pm—2pm.

I honestly just feel like I cannot rely on him for anything and I am frustrated and just…. I am out of ways to communicate with him that I cannot do everything myself. Is it too much to ask that while I am at work all day he at least cleans the bedroom?? I love him a lot and I have been on Reddit for long enough to know everyone goes to the break-up option. I am not breaking up with him, as I believe this is something we can work through. I just don’t know where to start or how to make him understand my perspective. 

tl;dr: I (23f) have a good relationship with my bf (23m) but he is unreliable and I don’t know how to approach this, as I have already tried numerous times. ",2,1736108829.0,relationship_advice,12,1.0,False

Well, our old Dyson ball finally kicked the bucket. We got almost 10 years out of it. Not bad. But the perfect excuse to finally convince my husband that yes we needed a $1000 vacuum had arrived. 

He couldn’t believe what I was telling him at first, but after showing him all the information I discovered (plus wire cutter reviews always help with him) he agreed it was what our 2 dog, 1 cat, plus 2 new kitten household needed. No, deserved. 

We found our local Sebo dealer. I called and asked for pricing on the Airbelt E3 as I had decided this was the right vacuum for us. The pricing was better than anything I saw online, $999, so we went in. 

The sales person was super friendly and helpful and showed us all the features. Once I mentioned all our furry friends he suggested we scale up to the D4. From my research, it seemed like a lot of folks think this model is too big. Heavier. Unnecessary for most households. I was hesitant on spending even more than I originally intended, but he and my husband (who was now fully on board with the premium vacuum plan lol) both thought it was the way to go. Plus the sales guy offered us $200 off MSRP, so $1199. We went for it. 

You guys. I love this vacuum. 

Was I nervous about going from an upright to a canister? Was I worried about the bigger size of the D4? Kind of. But the thing is, half the time we were also pulling out the shop vac anyway, as we liked it better than the upright Dyson for getting into little corners and vacuuming upholstery. So if anything, this feels like 2 vacuums in 1 to me, but is way more manageable than the big shop vac. Sure I’m getting the canister stuck here and there when I do my regular “upright” vacuuming, but I know I’ll get better at working with it. 

I cannot believe the usability design of this thing. I can be vacuuming the floor, and if I see a bigger piece I don’t want to roll up, or some dirt in a weird crevice, I can just pull the hose out of the powerhead real quick, suck whatever up, and stick it back in. 

The powerhead easily fits under all the furniture that my Dyson couldn’t. I am vacuuming under couches, chairs, cabinets, coffee tables, with absolutely no issue. Places I haven’t vacuumed in an amount of time I don’t care to admit, simply because I don’t want to move the furniture. And now I can vacuum under there every day if I want to. 

We have carpeted stairs and I really wanted to be able to use the powerhead on them. I asked the sales guy about this, as it still seemed a little too big and unwieldy for that. He told me to stick the flexible hose directly into the powerhead, so skip the hard metal tube. Then I can more closely guide the powerhead on each step with my hands. Genius. It works friggin great and the carpet on the stairs has never looked cleaner. 

Okay and last but not least being able to roll the cord up with a button. Sometimes it’s the little things. The cherry on top. Ugh I love this. 

Is $1200 a crazy amount to spend on a vacuum? I don’t know, but as somebody who has to vacuum a lot, I have zero regrets.

I called his mom crying that can i meet you and she said yes… i went to meet her mom and he also came.. after 5 min of formal talk i asked him to give his mom and me space so we can talk… glad i did it… for first 10 min i explained her why we are right for each other, how we have supported each other and bla bla.. but after that how she flipped… never seen more toxic person than her…. She started being too rude… and started saying things in a way that I thought either she will throw water/coffee at me or she will slap me 🙂 didn’t knew people like this existed… then she continued being her and i told her that her son proposed me…. she got another level of crazy and asked me to call him back and told me that she will slap him. In the end he came and still his mom was being typical toxic person so he asked her to stop being rude and lower her voice ,she got bit composed later, in the end he asked his mom to wait in car and told me that he won’t be able to continue this relationship as he is not strong enough to handle all this, he told me that what his mother behaved today, he is facing same things from past 3 months. he told me he is ready to die and end it all. I asked him to not give up. He told me those 3 years together were the only good 3 years of heaven in his life and after that it is going to be hell for him.

Here are my observations so far:

	1.	The service sector is very weak. I think any café with a few tables outside and average-quality coffee could do well.

	2.	The elderly population is very high, so there could be an app addressing their needs.

	3.	People don’t spend money easily, so maybe an app that helps them save more on their purchases.

	4.	There is too much bureaucracy, so a solution to reduce it could be valuable.

1hug62k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hug62k/how_do_i_stop_staying_up_late_on_the_weekends/,How do I stop staying up late on the weekends?,"I'm in my late 20s, and my whole life I've been bad about staying up super late on the weekends.  Usually until 3:00 a.m. but sometimes even 5:00 or 6:00. I don't even have to try to do it, I just eventually go to bed because I don't want to completely sleep away the next day.

I think I've at least figured out WHY I do it. I typically don't have any problem going to bed if I'm bored or if I'm going to do something during the day the next day. 

I stay up the latest when I'm enjoying something I'm doing or I'm hyperfocused on a task. So that could be playing a video game, playing guitar, watching a tv show, clearing up computer storage space, whatever. I think the reason I do this is that I know that once I go to sleep, I will have a break from whatever I'm doing. Like I'll have to shower, get dressed, make lunch, make coffee, brush my teeth, figure out what I'm going to that day, etc. And then somebody might text me and ask me to hang out that night, or my parents will call and ask me for a favor.

Amyway, I know it's bad for my body to have an abnormal sleep schedule, but I do it anyway. Like 2:00 a.m. rolls around and I'm like ""eh screw it"" and I'll just stay up. Has anybody else struggled with something similar and do you know of a good way to break the habit?

What I mean by ""bad"" is this: no matter how well I make it (or how well the barista at a fancy coffee shop makes it), if I really let myself taste it, it’s overwhelmingly bitter—something I don’t enjoy. If we’re strictly comparing the *taste*—not the effects of caffeine—between something like apple juice and espresso, I’d choose apple juice every time.

Maybe this is comparing apples to oranges (or to espresso, ha), but I can’t help feeling there’s a huge elephant in the room when it comes to conversations about getting espresso to taste “right.” Yes, you can balance it out with sweetness, acidity, or other flavor notes, but at the end of the day, it’s still coffee. It’s still going to be bitter and aggressive, and honestly, it’s not something I’d choose to *taste* if it weren’t for the other effects it provides.

For what it’s worth, I feel the same way about wine, whiskey, and similar drinks.",0,1736107844.0,espresso,10,0.18,False

thank you all and god bless 🙏

https://www.reddit.com/r/Portalawake/s/42D9j5sEOg


my previous post,

God , Satan and human evolution 

for some reason, something has formed in my mind .
a series of questions answers and thoughts keeped coming up  regarding the true nature of things. 
don't know how to start..so i just will

-God's way  : top to bottom,all potentials, timeless and limitless, the struggle and sacrifice of creation/separation from within.

-Lucifer's way: bottom to up phenomenon , made of parts,matter,self identification .


-Satan / Lucifer is real and the ruler of earth but God is eternal-

among the angels that God has created Satan is the most special , his rebellion against God
was certainly God's intention.
and is not evil from Gods perspective .

there is an allegory to explain things to come:

a soul of a man came knocking at heaven doors,
God then asks him: who is there?
the soul answers: it is ""I"" 
but not allowed to come in .
only when the soul realised and answered:
it is only you (God) that is there,
the soul allowed into heaven .

such was Satan's rebellion and the reason he was expelled from heaven , he dared to say 'I'  and have his own way. an illusion.
the earth,objective and the physical have been created in that way and is ,Satan's kingdom,  everything in it says ""I"".
separated and alien to underlying subjective .
and so is all modern science and medicine for that matter.

- Adam and Eve, Satan , Jesus and evolution -

at the garden of Eden, the fruit of the tree of knowledge is given to humanity by Satan,
because what is to be perceived as separate ego, ultimately comes from the thinking , dissecting mind,it is a battle ground for what falsely claims to be the real ,and everything else that makes that even possible, but seen as ""nothing but.."".

 as seen by evidence in a development of an individual, and corresponds to the of evolution humanity.   the scenes of self travels up , from the stomach, lungs, mouth to be behind the eyes .
Christ or the third eye consciousness is the next step, that was Satan's whole purpose in a sense.
the fire that is created between the known and the unknown, is the birth of the true self.


Alternative Creation Story 

-plus short analysis at the end-



it's a story about god's dream:

in the beginning,there was nothing.
 and then ,the dream was everything. 
everything roared like a lion with countless eyes , ramming and devouring each other .
seasons came and nothing left,and in their dreams they saw nothing.

in the second dream there were two dreams .
there was a wild boundless garden with many, what you would call ,sheeps , wolfs and bushes with thorns and sweet fruit .
many creatures ,all roaring with life .
and there was a Gardener who saw in his dream what the beasts and plants are seeing in their eyes.

after he saw in his dream that everything ""I""s and roars ,even the sheep thought that they were lions.
 
he immediately tended to cut down the thorny bushes that the sheeps got tangled with while eating the sweet fruit, that naturally made them drunk and even grow their wool resembling the main of a lion .
he built a fence of the thorny bushes , and a gate ,so the sheeps could go out to the fields of the wild bush.

then he fed the hungry wolf who couldn't get near the thorns of the bush that the sheeps were traped in.
and in return the wolf became loyal to the gardener ,and helped to impose his will on the wild.

the sun came,and the drunk sheeps did not burn in the bush with the dry thorns, but were trimmed ,and herd by the wolf to safety.
 
wild beasts came and the loyal wolf fended them off. floods came and the fences protected them.

in your dream, the third dream,
there are three dreams .
 the second dream ,that of the garden, the Gardeners dream and his deeds . 
and the first dream of the roaring sheeps , that threatened to burn everything in their drunkenness, in a garden of dry thorns and starving wondering wolves. 

all had to give up the the thing that they loved most, the thing that defined them,
but separated them from eachother and eventually from life itself.

they had to separate from them selves to for the principal of existence ,in the image of god.

                  -end-


-analysis and characters-

this story weaved in my mind from separate metaphors an impressios,

sheep vs lion -
a metaphor i heard once ,
of something in us that thinks its the king that protects and knows everything but in turn causes stagnation. it is said that in order to overcome this,we should make that lion in to a lamb and sacrifice it.

the sheeps- 
many as one ,opposed to singular that is many and therefore opposed to god.
also represents the multitude of personas the individual has .

also the sheeps connection to dreams ,as in counting sheeps before falling asleep.

there is of course the story of the coffee bean , the strange behaviour of goats after eating from the coffee bush, ,which are not sheeps but close enough.

the wild bush - represents in this case the beliefs we passively accumulate ,that if unattended grow wild ,and restrict our ego.
but can be shaped merely by conscious light,
to gather ,protect and feed it .

the wolf/dog -  represent intuition, connection to the unknown.
considered  as  one of the greatest conquers of man.
c g Jung talked about how the archetyp of a saviour ,or jesus, experienced as a dog in the dreams of his patients. 

numbers- 
0 -nothing - ultimate potential
1-something
2-something from nothing,separation , duality , stagnation 
3-the observer - the third elusive force that overcomes duality and stagnation. represents  motion,life .

dreams -  from the unknown , connection to past and future 
...
ok
there is always more ,
but need to go on with life.

thank you for reading 

apologies for the.. wording and grammar,,
it looks ok to me right now but there is always something 
 
hope you liked it

-conversation between satan and me -

m:hi ,i was wondering about stuff.. .

s: ..don't bother yourself.. see ,the whole world is random and crazy, your parents ,two confuse sacks of rotting flesh and rattling bones, fucked ,had a stupid baby, and that's you.  so go out, do the same and enjoy or don't, I don't care ,you have free will to do whatever you want, as I said, we can even cut a deal , either way I'll scatter your meaningless atoms across the infinite universe .that's the only way things can go here in my world . 

m: wow ,, that's a mouthful..could you do it other way? do you have free will? 

s: are you crazy ? don't you see all the multiplicities I'm all those things ,, it's a mess..

m: so you're the creator ?

s: I am things ,and would be random as I can ,and just freeze... but something makes me move and silly coincidences occur, .look at yourself.
 ..but it's all just random happening of separate things, and I am all those things, Im god. 

m: i know ..but things that happen, didn't you say they're happen only in one way they could.? 

s:yes .. nothing you can do 

m:so.. all random separate happenings must stand ,so that one thing could take place? 

s: ,, you could say so, , like your death!,muuhahahaha..

m: damn, that's .. funny..hh.. anyway,.it seems like, if that's the case, you could almost say that all random separate things and happenings,
 know somehow what the other random things are doing... i mean,could they be connected after all?

 s: F you, you're nothing but ..

m: come on.. you said yourself that there are silly coincidences, just trying figure out your world, since I'm here and all.

s: I don't need your help . this is nothing , I am the only thing that came into being and I don't care from where.
and that's right, you're stuck here with Me, I'm in your head.. there is nothing to figure out.  it's all just in your stupid imagination. 

 m: what... like its all a dream ,and everything is just me, and I should treat you and everything as such? 

s: smartass.. imagine that: I'm gonna get you in the end. 

m: yes I know, you'll have what's yours.





please don't judge me too soon,..
it's a lot to take in.
