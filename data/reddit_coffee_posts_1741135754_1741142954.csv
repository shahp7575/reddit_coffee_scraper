1j3sztk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1j3sztk/my_disturbing_waking_dream_became_an_unsettling/,My disturbing waking dream became an unsettling reality... that day.,"-I would like to pose a question to those of you who believe that Human Beings are creatures of free will:

What if you saw a disturbing glimpse of your future in a dream, and no matter how hard you tried to avoid it, you ended up causing it to happen?

Well, It happened to me. And I'd like to share it with you.

First a little background:
I was just a 12 year old kid, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn’t know much about ‘precognition’ and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits were comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.
  
The year was 1978.
  
Anyway, so I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet (about two blocks from my house) helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the Drive-in theater early Saturday and Sunday morning to help set up his vendor stall with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women’s shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. 
  
I was making 20 bucks a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at that new video game over at the arcade called ‘Space Invaders’.
  
On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over to my nightstand and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:00 when the ticket gates opened.
  
My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, (also known as the ‘alarm hand’). I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time…a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money.
  
I was an industrious young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns… or so I thought.
  
I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We’re talking deep R.E.M. sleep. The kind where time seems to no longer exist. Then I had a lucid dream. A very unsettling lucid dream. It went something like this:
  
I’m walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendor stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure. His display tables were adorned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. 
  
He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac up front. I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.
  
I stood shocked and dumbfounded as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound. The sound of a bell.
  
Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 
  
I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 
  
But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung’s face. The feeling of being late. And what the hell was he about to say just before my alarm clock jolted me out of it? I just couldn’t shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing keeping me from getting to work on time that morning. 
  
Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.
  
I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. I slipped my wrist watch on and checked the time against my alarm clock for a match. “This is ludicrous”, I thought to myself. “There’s no way I can be late. If anything I’ll be super early.”
  
I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 10 minutes to 6 in the chilly morning darkness toward the Drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 
  
The light of dawn wouldn’t break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 6:30 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knock out the setup by 7:00…just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. 
  
But this time it would be “a little bit different” I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet four lane thoroughfare.  Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the thoroughfare toward the main gate of the Drive-in theater with its landmark forty-foot screen looming in the distance. 
  
The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed and fought the urge to break into a run. 
  
It was unusually foggy that morning too. As I made my way through the shadows I couldn’t help but notice the ominous looking halos of swirling mist surrounding each street lamp. The theme song from ‘The Twilight Zone’ kept trying to seep into the cracks in my overactive imagination. 
  
And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. He recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. “Here a little early, arencha?” 
  
I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/café crew in the center of the Drive-in  lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 
  
I walked into the café and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for those bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. “Their day starts a lot earlier than mine”, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods. 
  
I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill, and got two quarters change. I grabbed an Auto Trader magazine from a rack by the entrance and scanned the area for a good place to sit.
  
Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I had an unobstructed view of our spot. I wanted to see Chung the moment he arrived so I could go out to greet him early. 
  
I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer into my cup, and chuckled to myself as I thumbed through the magazine. The dream faded for now, my mind preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 
  
About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 6:35 (about the time I would normally show up). By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. 
  
Vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots. The clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the Drive-in as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 
  
Vendors began filing into the café to get their morning caffeine and sugar fix. I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. Was Chung running late? I knew that his commute was considerably longer. His old cargo van had seen better days. 
  
Something was not right. The spaces on either side of ours were already busy with vendors and their helpers skillfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.
  
I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I’d call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone had an ‘Out of Order’ sign written in black marker taped across the coin slots. Go figure.
  
Back inside, I bought another cup of coffee with my last 50 cents. “Why not?” If Chung didn’t show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he’d be considered a no-show. 
  
Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 
  
I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, surrounded by a sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in that had materialized across the tarmac of the Drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 
  
If you’ve ever been to a swap meet you know what I’m talking about. It was now 7:00. It’s Showtime!
  
“Well, I guess that’s it”, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. Chung is a no-show. That whole dream was such a… well, it was just that…a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.
  
I headed for the exit on the other side of the now crowded café. Beyond it was my home less than 10 minutes away. 
  
Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. 
  
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like 'deja vu' come over me. 
  
“This can’t be…”, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw…him. It was the dream. Only this time, for real.
  
I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 30 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac…and I was late.
  
My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. “Chung?”
  
Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and, well…you know the rest.
  
Chung’s gaze met mine; “Oh there you are!” He said with a sheepish grin, “Sorry, I forgot to tell you…I switched spots!”

1. Would it look really bad to quit my clinical job? I still would volunteer as an EMT.
2. Does anyone have any recommendations for jobs that are low-key, non-clinical but still medical? Or should I just work at a coffee shop at this point?? I’m also studying for the MCAT currently, so would love extra time to do.

1j3sy24,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1j3sy24/the_venomous_vivian/,The Venomous Vivian,"The air in the café was thick with the aroma of coffee and the low hum of conversation. Marcus stirred his cappuccino absentmindedly, watching the rain drizzle against the window. Across from him, Elaine sat, her fingers curled around her mug, her expression a mix of sympathy and frustration.

“So, what now?” she asked, breaking the silence.

Marcus sighed, shaking his head. “I don’t know. I just wish I had seen through her sooner.”

Elaine didn’t have to ask who ‘her’ was. The specter of Vivian hung over their group like an unshakable shadow, a presence that Marcus had tolerated for far too long.

### **The First Betrayal**

It wasn’t always like this. Ten years ago, when Marcus first met Vivian, she had seemed warm, intelligent, and charming. She had a way of drawing people in, of making them feel special—until they no longer served a purpose.

The first real sign came when Marcus was going through a rough breakup. He had confided in their friend group, and while most were supportive, Vivian had reacted differently. At first, she played the role of the caring friend, offering advice and checking in on him. But soon after, Marcus learned that she had been spreading rumors behind his back—suggesting that he was emotionally unstable, that he had driven his ex away, that he was, in her words, ‘a wreck that no one should date.’

When Marcus confronted her, she laughed it off. “Oh, come on, Marcus. You know I’m just joking. Don’t be so sensitive.”

That was the first time he excused her behavior. It wouldn’t be the last.

### **The Ghosting Game**

Over the years, Vivian made a habit of disappearing whenever she pleased. She would engage in deep conversations, making Marcus feel valued—only to ignore his messages for weeks, even months, at a time. Then, just when he thought he had finally moved on, she would reappear with a casual “Hey! How have you been?” as if nothing had happened.

Marcus wasn’t the only one subjected to this treatment. She did it to others in their circle, but he was the only one who ever questioned it. Everyone else seemed to accept it, chalking it up to her ‘free spirit.’ But Marcus knew better. It was control. She wanted to dictate when and how she interacted with people, keeping them at arm’s length yet never truly letting them go.

### **The Wedding Sabotage**

When Marcus met Lydia, he knew she was the one. Their relationship moved fast, but it was real. When they decided to marry, Marcus extended an invitation to the entire friend group. Everyone responded with excitement—except for Vivian.

“I won’t be attending,” she had said bluntly.

Marcus was taken aback. “You don’t have to come if you’re busy, but—”

“Oh, it’s not that,” she interrupted. “I just don’t think you should invite me. It wouldn’t feel right.”

He should have let it go. But instead, he asked, “Why?”

Her response was chilling. “You know why.”

That was all she said before turning away. The next day, Marcus discovered that she had been privately messaging members of the group, insinuating that he was still seeing other women on dating apps—six months before his wedding. It was a lie, a complete fabrication. But it planted seeds of doubt. People started asking questions, whispering behind his back. Even Lydia, confident as she was in their relationship, was hurt that such rumors had even reached her ears.

Marcus had never felt more betrayed.

### **The Silent Resentment**

It dawned on Marcus then: this wasn’t about friendship. Vivian resented him. Perhaps it was because he had missed her wedding years ago due to work, despite his generous gift. Or perhaps she simply couldn’t stand to see him happy. Either way, her manipulation had reached its peak.

After the wedding, Marcus knew he had to cut ties. He blocked her on Facebook and WhatsApp—not in anger, but in self-preservation. He needed to be free from the toxicity she thrived on.

### **The Fallout**

The group’s reaction was mixed. Some understood, while others tried to dismiss it as a ‘misunderstanding.’

“She’s always been like this, Marcus,” one friend said. “You’ve just taken it too personally.”

Elaine was one of the few who saw the truth. “You’ve done the right thing,” she assured him. “You don’t owe her anything.”

Marcus nodded, staring out at the rain. He had lost years trying to maintain peace, excusing her behavior, pretending that the hurt she caused was accidental. But now, finally, he had clarity.

Vivian had spent years weaving a web of manipulation, but he was no longer caught in it. He was free.

### **A Marriage of Convenience**

Years later, Marcus heard whispers about Vivian’s life. She had married an average man—someone safe, reliable, but unremarkable. Some mutual friends speculated that she had done it out of love, but Marcus knew better. Vivian had spent years prioritizing control, her social image, and wielding influence over others. Deep down, she feared something more than anything else: being left behind.

As she approached her mid-thirties, the pressure of time became unbearable. The fear of growing old alone, of losing her perceived social value, had driven her to settle. It was a fate she had long mocked in others, but in the end, she had succumbed to it herself.

Marcus couldn’t help but feel a twinge of pity. Not because she had married someone she didn’t truly love, but because, for the first time in her life, she was the one who had compromised. And for someone like Vivian, that was the worst fate of all.

1j3sxdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabeticfirstcure/comments/1j3sxdq/did_you_know_these_common_foods_can_make_diabetes/,Did You Know These Common Foods Can Make Diabetes Management Nearly Impossible?,"**10 Worst Foods That Make Diabetes Control Nearly Impossible**

Managing diabetes is crucial for preventing long-term complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, and blindness. Although many people continue to enjoy foods that are delicious, some of these may raise blood sugar levels and interfere with insulin function, which can make diabetes control nearly impossible. In this guide, I will outline the 10 worst foods that people with diabetes should avoid to ensure they maintain better control over their blood sugar levels and overall health.

# 1. Sugary Beverages

Sugary drinks, including sodas, sweetened iced teas, and fruit juices, are some of the worst offenders when it comes to diabetes management. These beverages are packed with refined sugars, which cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. For example, a 12-ounce can of cola contains about 40 grams of sugar. When consumed in excess, sugary drinks can contribute to insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and increased belly fat. The high fructose content in these drinks further exacerbates these issues, raising cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which increases the risk of heart disease.

A much better alternative is to drink water, flavored with a slice of lemon, or unsweetened herbal teas. These options are virtually calorie-free and do not cause harmful blood sugar spikes.

# 2. Trans Fats

Trans fats are artificially created fats found in many processed foods, including margarine, packaged snacks, frozen dinners, and baked goods like cookies and crackers. These fats are added to increase the shelf life of products, but they are highly detrimental to your health. Trans fats have been linked to increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and higher levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, which further heightens the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

To avoid trans fats, check the ingredient list for ""partially hydrogenated oils."" If you see this, it's a sign that the product contains trans fats, and it's best to avoid it.

# 3. White Bread, White Rice, and White Pasta

Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, white rice, and white pasta are high on the glycemic index, meaning they cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. These foods have been stripped of fiber and nutrients, which are essential for slowing the absorption of sugars. While they might taste delicious, they offer very little nutritional value and can contribute to insulin resistance over time.

Switching to whole-grain alternatives, such as whole-wheat bread, brown rice, or whole-grain pasta, can provide more fiber and help to stabilize blood sugar levels. You can also try using cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles for a lower-carb, high-fiber alternative.

# 4. Flavored Yogurts

Although yogurt can be a healthy option for individuals with diabetes, flavored yogurts—especially those with fruit added—can be packed with added sugars. A typical serving of fruit-flavored yogurt contains about 60% of its calories from sugar, which can cause significant blood sugar spikes. Even ""low-fat"" or ""non-fat"" versions are often loaded with sugar to make up for the lack of creaminess.

Opting for plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt is a much better choice. It contains less sugar and more protein, helping to keep blood sugar levels in check and provide a feeling of fullness for longer.

# 5. Breakfast Cereals with Added Sugar

Many breakfast cereals, even those marketed as ""healthy,"" are loaded with added sugars and refined carbohydrates. A bowl of cereal may contain more than 40 grams of carbs, and some varieties contain only a small amount of protein, which is essential for stabilizing blood sugar levels. Consuming these cereals can lead to a quick blood sugar rise and poor diabetes management.

Instead of sugary cereals, opt for a protein-based breakfast, such as eggs, Greek yogurt, or a smoothie made with unsweetened almond milk, protein powder, and low-carb fruits.

# 6. Flavored Coffee Drinks

Fancy coffee drinks like caramel macchiatos or vanilla lattes from popular coffee shops can be dangerous for people with diabetes. These beverages are often sweetened with syrups and whipped cream, adding a significant amount of sugar and carbohydrates.

Instead of these sugary drinks, stick with black coffee, and consider adding a small amount of heavy cream or unsweetened almond milk for flavor. If you need a sweetener, opt for stevia or monk fruit.

# 7. Maple Syrup, Honey, and Agave Nectar

Although these sweeteners are often marketed as ""natural"" alternatives to refined sugar, they still contain high amounts of sugar that can spike blood sugar levels. Maple syrup, honey, and agave nectar are all examples of sugars that offer little in terms of fiber or nutritional value. Like table sugar, these sweeteners can contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, and poor blood sugar control.

It is best to avoid these sweeteners altogether and use small amounts of low-glycemic sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit when you need a sweet taste.

# 8. Dried Fruits

While fresh fruits are generally a healthy choice for people with diabetes, dried fruits are another story. When the water is removed from fruits like raisins, apricots, and dates, their sugar content becomes more concentrated. A small serving of dried fruit can contain several times more sugar and carbs than its fresh counterpart. For example, one cup of raisins contains the equivalent sugar of four cups of fresh grapes.

Fresh fruits such as berries, apples, and pears are lower in sugar and have a higher water content, making them a better choice for maintaining blood sugar control.

# 9. Packaged Snacks

Pre-packaged snacks like pretzels, chips, and crackers often contain refined flour and have a high glycemic index, which can quickly raise blood sugar levels. These snacks are also often processed and lack fiber, which is essential for slowing down sugar absorption. Many packaged snacks also contain hidden sugars and unhealthy fats, which can worsen insulin resistance and contribute to weight gain.

Instead of reaching for packaged snacks, try a handful of almonds or other nuts, a piece of cheese, or some cut-up vegetables with hummus for a healthier, blood sugar-friendly option.

# 10. French Fries

French fries, a popular fast-food side dish, are packed with refined carbs and unhealthy fats, especially when deep-fried in oils. Potatoes themselves are high in carbs, and deep-frying them creates harmful substances that can increase inflammation in the body. Studies have linked the consumption of fried foods like French fries to an increased risk of heart disease and cancer, in addition to worsening diabetes management.

If you love potatoes, consider healthier alternatives like sweet potatoes or parsnips. Both are lower in carbs and have a lower glycemic index, making them better options for managing blood sugar.

# Conclusion

Managing diabetes involves making informed decisions about what you eat. Avoiding these 10 foods—sugary beverages, trans fats, refined carbohydrates, flavored yogurts, sugary cereals, flavored coffee drinks, natural sweeteners like honey, dried fruits, packaged snacks, and fried foods—can help you maintain better blood sugar control, reduce your risk of complications, and improve your overall health. While it might be tempting to indulge in these foods, doing so can make diabetes management a lot harder and increase the risk of developing more serious health issues.

Instead, focus on whole, minimally processed foods that are rich in fiber, healthy fats, and lean proteins. By making these changes, you'll be on your way to better blood sugar control and a healthier life.

1j3sv73,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1j3sv73/the_fog_that_smiles/,The Fog That Smiles,"""It's thick tonight.""

Marlowe’s voice was nearly swallowed by the fog. It curled around him, clinging to his coat, stretching unnaturally across the cracked pavement. There were no streetlights—had there ever been?—but a glow pulsed somewhere in the murk, flickering like something alive.

""Feels thicker every night,"" I muttered. My breath didn’t seem to leave my mouth, just mixed into the fog, lost.

We stood at the edge of the main street. The town—Hollowhurst—was empty, or at least, it seemed that way. There were shapes of buildings, dim outlines with windows blacker than the sky. A laundromat, a florist, a diner with a sign that read OPEN even though the inside was dark. The neon letters hummed, faintly.

""What time is it?"" Marlowe asked.

""You asked that last night.""

""And?""

""And I don’t know.""

Neither of us carried watches anymore. Phones didn’t work here. The clocks in the buildings had stopped, their hands frozen at odd angles, as if they had been caught mid-motion and forced to hold still.

Somewhere deep in the fog, a door creaked open. A footstep, just one, then nothing.

Marlowe tensed. ""We should go back.""

""To where?"" I asked.

He didn’t answer.

We started walking, following the sidewalk even though we both knew it didn’t lead anywhere. The buildings shifted when we weren’t looking. Turn a corner, and you’d be back where you started, except the street would be just slightly different—one less mailbox, an extra window, a door that hadn’t been there before.

""Do you remember arriving?"" Marlowe asked, suddenly.

I stopped walking. The fog pressed closer, as if listening. ""What?""

""Here. Do you remember how you got here?""

""Of course I do.""

But I didn’t.

The diner’s sign flickered. OPEN.

""Let’s go inside,"" I said.

Marlowe hesitated, but followed. The door was unlocked. The inside smelled like old coffee and something sweet, something sickly. There was a man behind the counter. He wore a clean apron. His face was wrong.

""Evening,"" he said, voice warm. ""Haven’t seen you two in a while.""

Marlowe swallowed. I tried to remember his name. Did he have one?

""You serve food?"" I asked.

""Of course.""

The menu on the wall had no words, just empty white boards. There was no kitchen, only a doorway leading to more dark.

""We should go,"" Marlowe whispered.

The fog drifted through the doorway behind us. I looked back—the street outside was gone. Only mist. Thick, roiling.

""You ever wonder why you’re here?"" the man asked.

Marlowe grabbed my wrist. ""Let’s go.""

I pulled away. ""We keep leaving. We keep walking, and nothing changes.""

The man smiled. It was too wide.

""Maybe that’s because you’ve already left,"" he said.

Marlowe exhaled sharply, a sound almost like a sob. I turned to him—his face was pale, his hands shaking.

""What’s the last thing you remember?"" I asked.

He opened his mouth. Closed it.

Outside, the fog swirled, thick and expectant. The neon sign buzzed: OPEN OPEN OPEN OPEN.

The man’s smile didn’t waver.

""Would you like a table?"" he asked.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I had a brief relationship with a girl (F30) for about 6 months from summer 2023 onward. I loved this woman so much. She made me so happy and made me feel seen in ways I could have never fathomed. I like to think during the good times, I did the same for her. She told me repeatedly she’s never been able to be herself with someone like she had with me. However, over that brief time together, I became overworked, burnt out, depressed, and my insomnia (amongst other health issues) starting acting up again. 

A bit of background context: she had an issue with me smoking weed due to her past trauma involving the drug. I would take a few tokes off a vape before bed to unwind, and was open about this from the first time we met, so I didn’t expect to change my behaviours. Over time, she wanted me to do it less and less. Initially this was fine, but by the time my insomnia was taking over, I needed to rely on it as a sleep aid. I told her as much, and this started our downfall.

Soon, we were fight about the weed smoking every time she saw me. I naturally withdrew, not wanting to be around her cause it led to fighting and stress, and I was already burnt out. She was upset that I was withdrawing from the relationship. That led to more and more resentment. 

After 6 months, I was severely depressed, my burnout had worsened even more, and I was becoming su!c!dal. I’m not happy about how dark things got, but I knew it was bad. We mutually broke up then, as I wasn’t able to improve on my weed smoking, though we left the door open for further communication and potentially getting back together. I was so depressed at the time that I couldn’t fathom being with anyone (or continuing to live), but I know she wanted to get back together for a lot of it. We met up a few times, some resulting in more fighting, others being truly cherished moments for the two of us. 

Ultimately, 9 months after the breakup, I wasn’t doing any better. I was scared that I was holding her back, and I made it clear to her that I feared her waiting around for me while I fail at having a happy life. She took those words to heart and moved on. However, a few weeks later, after a serious medical procedure, I texted her while I was waking up from the general anesthesia. She was angry at first, really upset that I was sending her loving sentiments a few weeks after her expressing the finality of the relationship. It led to a big fight, where she ultimately spent the night. It felt so good to have her in my arms again. To hear her say she loved me again.

But after that night, I reminded her I was still smoking pot in the evenings and she blew up at me. Told me she didn’t want to date me because of it. I told her I could stop, but she was past that. I was crushed. Two weeks later, I reached out pleading to be with her again, and she reamed me out. I cried and begged for her to take me back. It got ugly, and she was vocal that I was acting like a pathetic mess. Told me to never talk to her again, told me that in the span of those two weeks, she was already in a new relationship, told me she didn’t want to be with me, and said some piercing insults. She told me to delete her number.

I ultimately had a lot of failures on my end in this relationship. I didn’t compromise on the weed, I withdrew, and often wasn’t able to listen to her to the degree a boyfriend should. I recognize I fucked up. But it’s been two months since the last time we spoke and all I can think about day-in/day-out is her. I dream about her, wake up thinking of her, and spend all day every day missing her. It’s been 2.5 months since we last spoke, and almost a year since the official breakup. 

I miss her so much, and love her so much. Especially now that I'm less depressed and can feel the extent of my feelings. I write her letters every day, though I would never send them so as not to bother her. I miss her so much. She was the light of my life; in those brief moments with her, I truly felt like I had a soulmate, and I miss that. But I also know many people would look at that much fighting and say otherwise.

Ultimately, I’m struggling moving on. I quit weed the day we last spoke, and spent the last 2.5 months really working on myself. My burnout is gone, my depression is better and I have the tools to better manage it, and I am really living in accordance with my values. 

Here’s the issue: I really want to reach out to ask her to go for coffee to catch up. Yes I’d love to be with her again, but I don’t have that expectation. I just want to see her again, see her smile and laugh, and be in her presence once more. And get closure, so that if we truly can’t be together, my last memory of her isn’t her spewing insults at me. But I worry it would be an intrusion. If she’s actually with someone new, I don’t want to mess with her head. If she’s not, she may still hate me and not want to hear from me.

I installed the Yellow dating app back in February what can I say? It’s both overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time.

What do I mean by that? nakakoverwhelm na I matched 20+ women which is cool but I don’t have a lot of time in a day to reply right away. Underwhelming kase umabot ako ng ganon kadaming matches yet sobrang bland majority ng response nila, I always try to be engaging and interactive how I construct my questions and approach naman.
(Pero parang nafefeel ko most of the women sa dating app had a recent break up or still trying to move on, pero ending di pa talaga sila fully healed) IDK I might be wrong or baka ako talaga ung problema hahaha.

I dated 3 women out of those numbers naman kahit papaano. Typical fine dine date, coffee and get to know more. They were all great, stable profession, good-looking, may value. Pero andun ung feeling ko na parang pilit lang lahat.

Iba padin talaga ung feeling na organically mo na meet ung tao at dumaan kayo sa due process lol. Ung tipong hindi mo hinahanap pero dumating na lang. Ganon ko kase nakilala ung dati ko eh, parang gut feeling mo na lang magsasabi na ahh ayan na yun.

Masaya naman ako right now lalo na sa achievements ko sa career and finances. Pero ibang iba talaga ang feeling na may kasama ka sa journey mo habang nagsusucceed ka noh?You get to share your wins with someone you love.

It’s probably gonna take some time din talaga to find that someone. Date to marry naman ang mindset ko I’m not into playing mind games at urong sulong. But I guess I’m gonna be single for a while or worst just be a cool single tito na lang din hahays.

She's now asked me to get coffee after work at a chain place (impersonal and low effort), we have never had a coffee date and this seems like a big step back in the type of dates we've had previously. To me this seems like she is going to break up with me, am I reading too much into it?

This is my first time dating after having my heart broken last year - I took some time to really work on myself after that but I guess I'm feeling insecure. My ex blindsided me and I just don't want go into another situation like that so want to be prepared for the conversation. ",1,1741141395.0,relationship_advice,5,0.67,False

Title: Blinking Lights Above Los Angeles on January 1st

**Time:** January 1, 2025, around 12:50 PM PST  
**Location:** Echo Park, Los Angeles, California

*Processing video jm8d2yj4wkhe1...*

I was walking home with a coffee in hand, passing through an alley behind my apartment, when I noticed a large flock of birds circling above my apartment building. As I looked up to check them out, I immediately saw three *very* bright lights high above them, just hanging there in the sky.

As soon as I spotted the lights, the birds scattered.

The lights didn’t make any sense. They were in sort of a triangle formation and moving slowly but definitely weren’t helicopters or airplanes. All three were blinking—very noticeably.

After watching for a while, I headed inside, grabbed my binoculars, and went back out. Through the binoculars, it seemed like they had some sort of shape, sorta pointy. My first thought was something shaped like the *lunar lander*—bright, shiny, and with angles and points.

I was trying to see if maybe they were objects that were rotating and reflecting the sun's light as they did so, but through the binoculars the blinking was even more intense. It was a distinct *ON / OFF / ON / OFF* like a blinker. And extremely bright.

I watched for maybe five minutes? Mostly with my naked eye or through binoculars. At some point, I decided to try filming, but because of the bright daylight, I couldn’t see my phone screen at all—so I had no idea if I was actually capturing anything. I just pointed the camera in the general direction and hoped for the best.

These lights continued to move around slowly. Eventually, two of them started to move away while one remained, and I just stopped watching and went inside.

I checked flight trackers and didn’t see any activity in the area, but maybe I converted to UTC incorrectly? Still, they obviously weren't planes or helicopters. I had no idea what I was looking at.

1j3sfgg,https://i.redd.it/y4jgei166sme1.jpeg,"""The Great Pretender""","---


Reen was known for her radiant smile. At work, she laughed at every joke, always had a kind word to say, and made everyone feel important. Her presence was warm, comforting—like a flickering candle in a dark room. People gravitated toward her energy, admiring her ability to always see the bright side.


Her social media told the same story. Bright photos of coffee dates, sunsets, and joyful moments filled her feed, each caption carefully crafted to show a life of happiness and gratitude. She often received messages from friends and acquaintances saying, “You’re such a positive person!” or “I wish I had your happiness.”


But none of them knew the truth.


Behind the smile was a woman who felt nothing.


At home, in the quiet of her small apartment, the facade crumbled. The warmth in her eyes faded as she stared at the ceiling, listening to the ticking of the clock. The world outside continued to move, but inside, she felt frozen in place. She wasn’t unhappy because of one specific tragedy—there was no great heartbreak, no devastating loss. It was just the exhaustion of pretending. The pressure to always be okay.


Some nights, she would sit in front of the mirror, forcing a smile, watching as her own reflection became unrecognizable. The act had become second nature, but there was no joy behind it—only muscle memory.


She had fooled everyone, even herself at times. But at night, when there was no one to perform for, the loneliness crept in.


It wasn’t that she didn’t have people who cared. She had friends, coworkers, and a best friend, Blam, who always checked in on her. But Reen was good at deflecting, turning conversations away from herself, redirecting them with jokes and compliments. No one ever pried too much—except Blam.


One evening, after another long day of forced smiles and empty conversations, Reen sat across from Blam at their favorite café. The hum of background chatter and the clinking of cups filled the air. Blam studied her closely, stirring her coffee absentmindedly before saying, “You don’t have to be happy all the time, you know.”


The words hit her harder than she expected.


Reen froze, her fingers tightening around her cup. She wanted to brush it off, to laugh and say something witty, but no words came. Her throat felt tight, and before she could stop herself, her eyes burned with tears.


Blam didn’t press her. She simply reached across the table, placing a hand over Reen’s, grounding her in that moment.


For once, she didn’t fight it.


That night, she allowed herself to feel. To acknowledge the sadness, the exhaustion, the truth. She sat on her bed with the lights off, letting the weight she had carried for so long settle in her chest. It wasn’t easy—she had spent years building this image, convincing herself and everyone around her that she was okay.


But in that small moment of honesty, something inside her shifted.


Maybe she didn’t have to pretend forever. Maybe, just maybe, real happiness would come—not as a performance, but as something real.


She didn’t have all the answers yet. She didn’t know how long it would take or what healing would even look like. But for the first time in a long time, she let herself breathe.


And in that breath, there was hope.

Its like he doesn’t even think about Callie, she isn’t his priority, she is the last thing on his mind.

Then the tacos come out with cucumber, which I can't eat unless it's w/ no skin or seeds bc it will tear up my colon and I asked if he could eat them. Then he starts asking if I have allergies or don't like them bc now I look like a PITA being picky about food.

Title: Corbell's 'false flag'...asteroid 2024yr4?

remember corbell talking about an upcoming false flag threat? iirc it was something that was going to be detected and identified as global threat that would take about 7 years to reach earth or...something along those lines?

well, the JWST was just rescheduled for 'emergency observations'...and China jas announced a 'planetary defense' team

obv no one is calling the asteroid an alien ship or anything but...the timing and potential global threat parts do seem to line up; anyone else thought of this or have i maybe just not had enough coffee yet?

Its a ferry crossing over 3 days. The ship looks wonderful with all the black and white art and exhibits on the walls. All the areas are exquisitely designed. 

It was much more like a huge ship - the wide open promenades going all around the ship, open to the weather and wind. There's just so much open space on that ship!

Just staring out into the dark grey seas, the majestic mountains and cliffs, the fog - looked so amazing. esp the fact that you can stand on the bow and look out into nothing with no one around you. I can easily imagine spending hours just relaxing, maybe with a coffee or a drink, enjoying the calm and the views. Semed like heaven.

Speaking of views, I've never been on them, but they looked just as good as any of the Alaska/Antartica cruises.

The town where it stopped, Torshavn, looks exactly like those quaint European towns you see in the Scandinoir crime shows and would be a wonderful way to spend a few hours walking around for free and seems as worthy a visit as any of the regular stops on a cruise.

The fact that it wasn't a cruise means it won't appeal to everyone, and if they had free meals it'd probably be perfect. But this just looked so inviting and I now want to go on it. Has anyone done this or similar journeys?",2,1741140566.0,Cruise,1,1.0,False

* Thursday and Friday: half a cooked yellow squash, 1/4 a turnip, boiled egg or cooked chicken breast and 1/2 avocado.

1j3s4xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/overwatch2/comments/1j3s4xp/time_to_rant_developer_overreach_and_the_general/,Time to rant. Developer overreach and the general state of Multiplayer in 2025.,"First Reddit post, decided to dump it here.. go figure. But need to let some stuff go. Consider yourself **warned**, or get a coffee. This post was inspired by systems such as the leaver penalty, combined with forced win/loss in matchmaking. Not unique to Overwatch, but very blatantly implemented in this game.   
  
Quick background: I've been playing MP games since Quake 3 Arena back in 2001 and lots of online competitive fps ever since like the original MoH, RTCW, Killzone 2 and many more.   
Now before matchmaking became a thing.. MP gaming was such a simple yet efficient deal:   
You have good players that inspired the newcomers to play better, and bad players that aspired to become like the good players if they so wished.   
There were no systems in place to balance things out, no (unseen) rating or rank that you would hold, or a tracking system that would decide the preferred outcome of your next match.   Just pure, raw, bare bones MP gaming.  
Some players were simply unreal, some barely knew how to use a mouse, and it was all in the same match. Or you could simply switch servers and try with some other folks, until you either gave up or got better at the game, and once you did, it was instantly noticeable.  
It worked perfectly, it caused MP gaming to grow into what it is now.  So why change it?

Now I know, in the interest of player retention you'd want to balance out those matches, minimize the players leaving your game and finding another hobby to spend time on when they can't find their turn in the game.  
But there is such a thing as overreach. Overly controlling systems that decide who and when, why and how.  
And it messes with everything that (imo) made multiplayer gaming such a cultural success.   
  
Which brings me to OW2. As a faithful Pharah main since 2016 (closest I've gotten to blasting rockets a-la Quake 3) the experience has just been getting worse with each year.  OW initially was very open, casual, fun and left to each players desire as to what character to play etc.  But more and more I've found that freedom to be taken away.  Restricted hero pickings, restrictions on leaving lobbies (penalties), more aggressive matchmaking (steamroll or steamrolled depending on your previous matches, essentially condemning you to a pre-decided outcome) just to name some.   

I'm sure these systems were made with the right intention.. (quote needed), but I'm afraid it destroys the competitive spirit entirely. Now if the matchmaking would actually be fair and consistent, I could see why a penalty system would be an idea. But the matchmaking seems to be deliberately unbalanced, and players are getting punished for recognizing the patterns and leaving the match.   
And I've tested it. Purposely de-ranking for days, to such a point as to where I couldn't stop losing games even if I tried (literally did nothing all match, still winning consistently or get forced backfilled into winning teams, joining teams with full comms etc)  
As well as the opposite, trying my hardest to progress yet getting loss after loss (to a point of being backfilled into losing games with 1 minute left multiple times, full dps teams ignoring the obj etc.) 

All consistently, test after test. (and I've done quite a few)

There are obvious systems at play here, and I sincerely believe these systems are for the worse, and are causing people to ditch OW. Even if players can't quite pinpoint it, they can still sense somethings' up.  
There is such a thing as too many systems and too much control. 

Maybe I'm just getting too old or something, but MP gaming used to be an enjoyable activity to dive into in the late hours, not a source hopelessness and stress.

1j3s419,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1j3s419/help_me_find_a_new_perspective_as_i_age/,help me find a new perspective as I age,"After weeks of re-drafts, I have given up on trying to hide how lost I feel and given up on trying to avoid even the whiff of left-over self-pity, so I apologize in advance, and I thank anyone who reads this and can offer me help.

I was impressive until about five years ago,  successfully hiding the depression that hit me until a car ran into me and I spent a semester on medical leave from the university where I teach.  But after I recovered, I found I could not do the things I had done five years ago.

The doctors at the hospital insisted I had made a full recovery from the accident, so I confronted my personal physician about it.  She told me that I *had* made a full recovery;  my problems were nothing more than the natural consequences of my passing the half-century mark.

When I pointed out how sudden it was, she said to me in effect, ""There are some men who can stave off the effects of age for a while as you had, through sheer willpower and stubbornness, but they pay a price for it, and when age finally hits them it gets some paypack for the delay.""

I said I would put up with any surgery, any medication even suspect ones like steroids, to return to ""normal"", but she insisted this is now my normal.

What I want to know is how a person can live like this, what great wisdom or new perspective enables them to live like this without feeling like they're just wasting time waiting for death to arrive?   I don't want to be like a catatonic horse grazing just outside the glue factory until they're ready to take him in for pulping.

I have swallowed my pride and found a psychological counselor, but counselors around here won't talk about spiritual or philosophical issues, and I don't dare say anything about wondering if I'd been better off dying in that accident without the counselor panicking and insulting me that I might not stick through this life to end.  I intend to stick through it; I just don't know how.

Five years ago, I was the ""go-getter"" in my division at the university, the innovator and problem-solver everyone turned to, the ""man who made it all work somehow"".  More than once I was told I was like one of those ice-cutter ships that break up thick ice on the sea to make a wake everyone else could follow.   They tell me that I left a hole they never managed to fill during my semester on medical leave.   I mattered.

I couldn't leap up the stairs three at a time as I did in my 30s, but I could still run up the steps.  I mastered new classroom technology quickly enough that I tutored other professors in it.  I was often (far from always) the person with the last word that everyone else agreed with at our department meetings.

But it's nearly impossible to be the ""ice-cutter"" when I have to rely on the banister half the time to get up the stairs now.

It's nearly impossible to be the innovator when I can no longer remember what it's like to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep without waking up for bathroom trips or waking because some random part of me has decided to ache for no discernible reason and so I'm always tired at department meetings.

It's nearly impossible to be the ""stand-up man"" at a department meeting when I sometimes need help getting to my feet or when they have to indulge me with a bathroom break when everyone else could go another three hours -- just as I could five years ago.

It's humiliating to find myself now the last person to be able to master the newest technology, to go from the person I.T. saluted to the person I.T. dreads to hear from.

I remember five years ago when the department needed volunteers to move desks and other heavy furnishings around.  I accomplished just as much as the younger men and woke up the next day without a single ache or pain for it.   A couple of weeks ago, the university needed volunteers again, and I hurt my back the first hour.  Instead of lifting things usefully, I ended up . . . fetching coffee and sandwiches.   All my decades of learning and life experience, my Ph.D. and teaching career, my intelligence, worthless as I found myself diminished from a ""go-getter"" to a ""go-fer"".

How can I manage to achieve anything worthwhile or live a life that has any value or worth to it if I find that half the time when I enter a room I can not for the life of me recall what I went into that room for in the first place???

I recall reading wise men of the past claim that to age graciously an older man must find his purpose in different things than the worldly achievements that defined his 20s and 30s, that heroism is a young man's game and that older men should become instead . . . what?

Surely there is some way of understanding the world, some new perspective, which says that I have more to look forward to in this life than picking out a nice burial plot and staring like Alexander the Great at all that remains to be conquered that is now beyond me.

I hope you can tell me what what purpose there is to life when one no longer has a worthwhile body, what role remains for us to fulfill, what identity we can have when go-getter and ice-cutter and innovator become rare peaks instead of our daily norm.

If you have managed to put up with reading this far, I thank you.

If you have actual worthwhile advice to share, I am honestly grateful, though I doubt I have any talent of expressing that well right now.

Thank you.",1,1741140073.0,AskGaybrosOver30,8,1.0,False

**Noise Level Comparison:**

✈️ **Jet Takeoff** – 120dB (Your ears will NOT thank you 🎧)

🗣️ **Casual Conversation** – 60dB (Your usual coffee shop chat ☕)

🌬️ **HyperFlow ARGB** – 28dB (A balance of cooling & noise 🔄)

🔇 **HyperFlow Silent – 23dB** (MONTECH’s quietest AIO cooler EVER 🌊)

The proposed virtual card usage model is as follows:  
  
\- Subscribers will receive virtual cards for payment purposes.

  
\- These virtual cards can be added to their Apple or Google Pay wallets for convenient checkout integration. Alternatively, they can manually input card details at checkouts.

  
\- The virtual card will remain locked until the subscriber manually indicates their intention to make a purchase (e.g., for cupcake/bakery-related products where Visa is accepted). The card will automatically lock every 15 minutes.

  
\- Upon card unlocking, the subscriber will input the transaction amount. Funds will be transferred from my company’s account to the subscriber’s virtual card to cover the transaction.

  
\- Upon purchase confirmation, the subscriber will upload a picture of the transaction receipt.

  
\- The funds will be sourced from the subscriber’s monthly or annual subscription, which covers 50% of a transaction, up to $2.50 per day. Subscribers will be responsible for the remaining balance for transactions exceeding this limit.

1j3rxmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1j3rxmq/odd_dream/,Odd Dream.,"Bit of a back story, my mother passed away the day before my birthday 14 years ago. My brother, my father, and myself I think dealt with it all different ways. Our Dad kind of left without saying much, just disappeared for a couple of months. My brother and I used martial arts as an outlet. I also started drinking heavily for a couple of months. I don't think anyone of us ever got closure from it. Our Dad leaving has severely impacted myself and my brothers relationship with him now, which is unfortunate as I have a daughter, and my brother is expecting his first child in the summer. I always wished that my daughter could have had the type of relationship with my Dad that I had with my grandparents. Luckily, my wife has amazing parents, and even though there is no blood relation (Wife is my daughters step mom), they have never treated her any different. 
I have never really had dreamt of my mother, at least any dreams I can remember. But last night I had a dream of just my mom, my brother and I. We were younger, toddler age and my mom was in her early 30's. We were living in a house I didn't recognize. It was in shambles, and barely standing. I recall one part of the dream where I was able to actually stick my head out of a hole in the roof and look around. But my brother and I were so happy, always playing. It was honestly great as my brother now has moved to another province and I don't see him as much as I'd like. Through out my dream, my mother always had the same look on her face. It was the same look she had while battling cancer. I couldn't tell if it was a depressed look or not, but my mom would just sit at the kitchen table until 4am, smoking and listening to music through her headphones. Her eyes just always seem to be fixated on something that seemed far away. When I woke, I really started to reflect on this as I had my morning coffee. I have never talked about my feelings about my mom's death. Not with my brother, or wife. Never sought help. I am really contemplating on what this dream meant, the house I never knew in shambles. My mother's expressionless face. I think this is the first time I've ever talked this much about it all. 
I did mention this dream to my brother and couple of hours ago, and he mentioned that he had a dream about our recently passed uncle ( mothers side) last night, and that they were sitting at the kitchen table and he took his hand, and my uncle gave him a nod.

Today, I want to share a little story related to my nsOne project. I won’t go into technical details or boring stuff, but rather the conditions in which I worked.

Many people think that you need expensive equipment and a high-end lab to create something innovative. But the truth is, I built this entire project using tools so cheap that most would call them “the worst purchases ever.”

I started with fine sandpaper—yes, the kind used for smoothing walls—to work on the motherboard, along with a $9 soldering iron from a local Chinese store. This thing takes forever to heat up, so I literally have time to make a coffee before it’s ready, and it’s not even temperature adjustable… but in the end, it did its job.

I also used a $15 hot air gun with only two settings (250°C or 450°C). It took a lot of practice, but I eventually learned to remove and reattach every single chip on the PS1 motherboard—even the 208-pin ones—without damaging them.

To test connections, I relied on a $7 multimeter from a flea market. Not the most convenient tool for touching tiny pins, but it got the job done. To align the two motherboard layers, I used GIMP, an open-source software, and scanned everything with a 300DPI printer scanner. For checking component footprints, I simply printed them on A4 paper to verify their accuracy.

The most useful tool? Probably my $20 digital caliper with 0.01mm precision. It was crucial for making accurate measurements and recreating some of the board’s components.

All of this is to say: you don’t need a huge budget to create something meaningful. What you really need is passion, ingenuity, and perseverance.

I have had men before this specific guy violate my boundaries and have clear signs of porn induced behavior/fetishes/kinks

I would say I am relatively sex positive but am now anti porn and BDSM/kink esp anti “curative kink” where people who are severely traumatized use BDSM and kink as a “cure”/coping mechanism when actually it’s truly just a form of self harm 

I naively started dabbling in the kink scene when I moved to a bigger city 3 years ago believing it was the best way to explore being queer at the time

I’ve been asked multiple times to engage in trauma reenactment for “healing purposes” - for example one guy who had a alcoholic father asked me to beat the shit out of him and ""induce genuine fear"" in him and another guy who was verbally abused a lot as a child (and fully admitted to knowing that's why he had a degradation kink) asked me to degrade and do cbt on him 

I have no trauma induced fetishes or kinks and no desire to feed into/engage with someone else’s trauma induced fetish/kink

I was extremely triggered when hearing about these things like rape role play, ddlg, race play, age play/regression and even seeing men on FEELD openly asking me to be their sex slaves, telling me they want to beat me, leave bruises all over my body and telling me how much they love rape role play and degradation

Or even men who wish to enact degrading acts they see in porn like face fucking, choking, slapping, verbal degradation, and spitting

Back in April I went on a date with and hooked up with a 28M Pakistani Canadian man (mentioning he is Pakistani bc I am Indian and thought it would be really nice to meet someone from a similar south asian background/naively trusted him more bc of that)

I met this person on FEELD, I first matched with him in Fall of 2023, then we fell out of touch and rematched on FEELD this last spring and met up

he’s conventionally pretty attractive (think somewhat Arabic type looks and 6’1”) and intelligent

He works at a top hedge fund in New York City and is very well educated

I think these were our first messages over Feeld 

Him - (my name) 

Me - yes? 

Him- when are you coming home? The kids are missing you

Me - lol haha, but do you miss me? 👀

Him - yes tbh more than the kids I’m crying myself to sleep 

Just very smooth talker type guy if you get what I mean

We end up finally meeting for a dinner in April

2 things 

First as a Indian women I am very used to dealing with misogynistic south asian men in my community

more so many south asian men who fall into the “I am a good guy” trope and would like to believe that they are progressive and open minded but don’t even realize they are misogynists

Secondly, I am also very used to men trauma dumping on me even tho they barely know me - which I believe happens due to men not being in therapy as well as not practicing emotional intimacy in their own relationships/friendships 

He was one of these men 

I am 5’8” and intimidate most men bc of my demeanor

Immediately I saw that with him 

This man did not want a strong woman as much as he would like to believe he did and had voiced in his FEELD bio - literally said ""I like my coffee like I like my women - strong""

he wanted a small submissive girl he could degrade

We got dinner and I could see he was put off by me bc I don’t have submissive energy, I am a SWE, have my own place, moved to the city on my own, and also when I told him I consider myself sorta switchy and have done some anal play with men

I told him I anally stimulated a guy 

“Wait what” He was p shocked

After dinner he asked if I wanted to go hang out at his and I stupidly said yes honestly just going with it bc at that time I just wanted to fuck ( I was horny and dumb and now no longer do one night stands bc this fucked me up so bad)

At his place we smoked a joint together and he starts trauma dumping 

His parents are divorced, his dad cheated on his mom and is currently living the bach life in California and it’s clear that he is very affected by it/hasn't healed from it

He hinted that he has cheated in his relationships, fucked people he knew were cheating on their partners/spouses with him and that bc his dad didn’t give a fuck why the hell should he 

Very clear to me that he is a sex addict and fully falls into the fuckboy finance bro trope - he fucks younger girls 18-19 year olds and Instagram/OF models

Just the way he talked about women was disgusting, he talked about having MMF’s with his frat brothers in college saying “when a girl has both her holes filled and can’t do anything about it that’s so fucking hot”

Also mentioned Adriana Chechik (a porn star who has made very sexually violent porn esp anal porn)

And wtf does that mean “she can’t do anything about it?”  So rapey 

Not once did he seem to talk about the girl’s pleasure or even ask me once about what I liked during sex/how I like to be pleased/my boundaries

Then I made the mistake of asking him what are his kinks, what he enjoys during sex/the kinkiest thing he’s done

He initially hesitated before saying CNC and I immediately became uncomfortable 

He was like “yeah it happened right here in this apt and just so you know I recorded her giving consent bc I want to run for office one day and I don’t need this shit following me around”

“Did you enjoy that?” I asked hesitantly 

“yeah I really enjoyed it” his eyes widened like he couldn’t believe it himself 

Idk why I asked but I asked him what role play they did and he said they pretended she was his friend’s gf and his friend was out somewhere and she was at his apt waiting for her bf 

I asked why he enjoyed it

He hesitated before saying very matter of factly “I was stronger than her”

I said “so you liked the fact she was helpless?

He hesitated again before saying yes 

Then bc he noticed I was uncomfortable he quickly says I talked to a mutual friend about it who said ""but don’t you feel like bc sex is so demonized for women that they have to feel powerless to enjoy it?”

I asked if that’s what his friend said to him to make him feel better and he said yes 

I said no I don’t believe that 

Then bc it got uncomfortable to change the subject I told him it’s fine as long as it was ethical and consensual (which was a lie I don’t fucking believe that, rape can never be ethical or consensual)

First of all - that is probably the most fucking misogynistic rape culture promoting thing I have ever heard in my life and you're essentially saying sex is something that just happens to a woman not something she has any agency or control over whatsoever

Second of all - what does that have to do with you enjoying it? Enjoying her struggling, saying no, begging you to stop? Your cock seriously got hard as you ripped her clothes off, degraded her verbally, penetrated her as she resisted and cried and tried to get you to stop?

I was on his couch and he was sitting about 6 feet away from me which I found weird considering he was the one who invited me over I thought he'd make a move but he still seemed p thrown off by me 

I guess it’s impt to note I was buzzed, p sleepy, had one Aperol spritz at dinner and smoked a joint with him (I have a very low tolerance for both alcohol and weed)

Since it was a weekday night and getting late he said I should prolly leave so I said okay, I grabbed my coat and walked to the front, put my shoes on and called my uber 

He had a pull up bar attached to the first room door at the front of his apt and started teasing me asking me if I could do a pull up I said no plus I had already called my uber

He kept asking me to do one (which looking back maybe was a tactic to try to make a move I am not sure) and I said idk how to do it, he did one pull up to show me, and then I said ok

I took off my coat, went over and tried to do one, he came up behind me and helped by putting his hands on my waist and lifting me up 

I came back down and was lying against his chest, his arms around my waist, it was just silence as we stared at each other 

Honestly idk what the actual fuck was wrong with me you guys 

There was so many fucking red flags he had exhibited up until that point and I had already called an uber - I think I was tired, buzzed, still processing all the shit he said and didn’t realize in the moment that I didn’t actually want to/shouldn't fuck him 

my mindset at the time was unfortunately - hey I'm already here might as well hook up with him, I did not realize until after wtf I had done 

He still didn’t make a move as we looked at each other so I leaned in to kiss him and we start making out 

We are making out for a bit and then I am thinking my Uber must be outside so I pull away and tell him 

He stops kissing my neck and is like oh shit I'm sorry your uber is here you gotta go and then I’m like uhhh whatever it’s okay we can keep going 

So, not only did I make the first move, but I was given an avenue to leave and I fucking decided to stay 

I hate myself so much for this

Even the way he fucked me made it clear he does not give a single fuck about women’s pleasure and genuinely views them as holes to fuck 

We started in doggy and as I started moaning he clapped his hand over my mouth and told me to shut up

Which again did I ever tell you I like that and want you to degrade me? No bc you didn’t ask me at all what I like during sex its evident that it’s just about you fucking the girl the way you like, having your way with her and getting your nut in 

I pulled his hand off and then we continued 

You know that face men make when they’re trying to cum, fucking you, eyes closed, contorted in pleasure but it’s like you’re not even fucking there at all 

Idek how to explain it but I felt like a fucking fleshlight while he fucked me

I am big on mutual pleasure and communication before, during and even after sex

I kept trying to bring his face down to mine to talk to me and remind him that I’m there too even just make out but it’s like he didn’t give a fuck and was just trying to get his nut in and cum

He didn’t reciprocate head, didn’t try to make me cum, and just jack hammered me in doggy and missionary and I rode him for a bit (sorry if this is TMI)

And the absolute worst part is I let him fuck me raw and cum inside me 

I feel so used

I fucked a rapist and for months I had panic attacks bc of it

I am so so angry at myself 

I really didn't think that this would affect me that much but ever since that day his words and that night are burned into my mind

**“Yeah I really enjoyed it”**

**“I was stronger than her”**

**""So you liked that she was helpless?"" ""yes""**

**""But don't you feel that sex is so demonized for women they have to feel powerless to enjoy it?""**

I went down a deep rabbit hole after this researching and after looking at studies found that most rapists main motivations was the lack of consent that turned them on and made them feel powerful - I even read a Reddit thread that went viral (many of you have prolly seen it) where a convicted rapist does a AMA and he admits he had rape fantasies and it was about dominating and degrading the women he raped making them feel completely powerless 

He literally says ""I wanted to dominate and hurt a woman. Degrading them was the goal.”

""I'm not using triggering language here, but I'd think of her in the most degrading way possible. I'd make her less than human in my head. Just a body, a thing.""

The language is so similar to how I feel this man not just talked about women in general but also why he enjoyed the CNC 

And no the girl he did it with “consenting” to it does not make me feel better. I view her as a victim and so any kinksters who come across this pls don’t fucking say some shit like bUT sHe conSented tO it sO he’S not aCTUally a RApisT

Consent does not equate to something being ethical or good

And I have consented to sex acts in the past that have left me feeling used and empty esp with porn sick men

And the fact he even agreed to do sumth like that in the first place means he had rape fantasies and def wanted to indulge them which also makes me feel even more disgusted that I fucked him 

I feel like shit that I even let this man touch me, the fact he received pleasure from my body and I keep thinking about that fucking girl and what he did to her and for some reason I feel responsible for it bc I fucked him AFTER he told me those things

It has been months and I still think about it, I have so much guilt over making the first move, staying after I had the opportunity to book it when my uber was waiting outside, FUCKING THIS MAN, how tf did I let him fuck me raw and nut in me (btw I got tested, I'm thankfully clean and I am on BC)

not vetting him beforehand and asking what he was into which I usually try to be proactive about with the people I hookup with 

I have had fucking nightmares about him, I think about how he fucked me on the same bed - him over her body, pinning her down, hand clapped over her mouth to stifle her cries and degrading her 

And what he could have done to me 

And I hate that he’s the type of south asian man I absolutely despise from my community who lives a double life  - A perfect well behaved, respectful muslim boy in front of his mother and sister - but outside of that he’s a complete pos

I regret ever being on FEELD, getting into kink bc I genuinely thought that this was the best way to explore my bisexuality and feel sexually empowered and instead I am meeting these porn sick men and unfortunately women too

What is worse is I stalked him on social media and he’s already involved in politics - a cheeky lil photo of the fucker smiling next to the NY senator 

Then again our god damn president has like 25 sexual assault cases against him so this is just the world we fucking live in I guess 

I saw someone else on here talk about how seeing all this shit is so normalized is making them misanthropic and honestly I am on the same path and I really hate that

The fact that there are porn sites and subreddits with rape\_hentai, rapefantasies, CNC\_connect,  rapekink, rapefantasies, with more than a million subscribers is terrifying 

The fact that there are women who have hired men to show up to their house and rape them, have men or worse their own partners “consensually” drug them and take advantage of them is terrifying

The fact that all of this is becoming normalized is terrifying

We are going backwards 

When the Gisele Pelicot case broke I saw so many people who were horrified but I’m not bc I feel like I know now how fucked this world is after being exposed to all this 

I am so sad dude 

I am so so fucking drained 

Another note -

He also hit me up in September saying I popped up on his tinder and asked to see me again

at the time I thought I would get closure by confronting him and telling him what I really thought of him (which I don't believe anymore I think I was still angry and thought this would help)

I replied and told him I didn’t want to hook up again and asked him to hang as friends as a pretense for that confrontation, he said he was down and then when I asked to take a walk and grab gelato in the city he never replied to me (surprised at first be he said he was okay with being friends but obv he only wanted to fuck again and I honestly believe that once i suggested a public place he realized he couldn't even try to make a move/coerce me into it)

Sorry the way I wrote this was kind of all over the place but yeah

I hope anyone reading this stays away from men like this and never has to experience this

It was terrifying being alone in that apt with him his words still echoing in my head ""I was stronger than her.""

I want to find someone to explore the city, go on dessert dates with, and get to know better. Maybe we could become travel buddies and develop a relationship if we like each other enough. Generally, I think the best relationships are the ones where we truly like each other as friends first. While I want an in-person connection, I wouldn't mind talking if you're further out too.

Anyway, I'm pretty laid back personality-wise, but at the same time competitive and ambitious. I definitely fall in the ""work to live, not live to work"" camp. I'm bilingual, average weight, 5'6"", and reluctantly work out a few times a week to counteract my love of pastries. Chocolate chip oatmeal cookies are my go-to for baking. In my free time, I like to program (and am generally passionate about all things computers), read sci-fi novels, binge-watch TV shows, play sports like soccer or basketball, enjoy video games, or read news articles/listen to economics podcasts. I've been getting more into podcasts lately during my morning subway commutes. Speaking of which, the lack of cell service during the commute is really annoying, but I'm lowkey pretty enamored by the fact there's functional public transit and a really extensive metro system. I'm also kind of a nerd about public transit and pedestrian-friendly cities.

Less frequently, I love to travel and wouldn't mind a travel buddy for my next trip. I really enjoy listening to music and am a bit of an audiophile (I love my headphones!). Let's exchange music recommendations. Last year's highlights were albums from Kendrick, Father John Misty, The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Magdalena Bay, Beth Gibbons, and St. Vincent. I'm not the most outdoorsy person, but if you are, I wouldn't mind accompanying you as long as it's not too extreme like sky diving. I generally prefer activities that are active to counteract my natural desire to be a homebody.

I don't smoke, do any drugs, rarely drink, am not religious, and am left-leaning. I value people who are curious about the world and like to learn, but who are also empathetic and kind-hearted. I generally like being informed about what's happening in the world and care about social issues. If those aren't dealbreakers, then you should also know that I don't like to drink coffee or tea.

Eventually I'd like to use both (probs not on the same days to avoid potential irritation), but I was wondering if anyone had input on which should go first. I'm expecting a bit of purging from both of them, so that doesn't really impact my choice. 

I've got the Naturium AA 10% with niacinamide, vit c, and coffee seed extract, and the Anua 2% salicylic acid BHA toner. A goal with both of these is to target clogged pores/closed comedomes, but I also want the AA to help with oil, redness, and uneven/dullness. 

Since AA is also an exfoliant, I'd probably only use the SA toner about once a week once my skin is used to the AA being used regularly to avoid over exfoliating.

-aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser 
-anua heartleaf hyaluron soothing toner 
-bubble brightening eye cream 
-byoma phyto-mucin glow serum

We've been together for a year, and while I’ve always known we had different approaches to life, I didn’t realize how deep the gap really was until now.

For context, I work two jobs (one in finance, one in tech), study full-time at a top university, and still make time for the gym and personal projects. I’m constantly pushing myself to improve because I want to build a stable, successful future. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has always been more “go with the flow.” He works part-time at a coffee shop and spends most of his free time gaming or scrolling social media. I’ve tried to be patient because I figured not everyone needs to move at my pace, but I at least expected him to have *some* kind of plan.

For the past six months, he’s been saying he’s actively applying for internships and looking for better job opportunities. He always told me how hard the job market is, how competitive things are, and how he’s just waiting to hear back. I trusted him. I even offered to look over his resume and help him practice interviews, but he’d always brush it off and say he had it under control.

Well… I just found out he hasn’t applied to a single job. Not one. Not in the past six months. He admitted that he kept *meaning* to but felt overwhelmed and never got around to it. Instead of actually working toward something, he just let me believe he was trying.

I feel betrayed. It’s not even just about the job applications—it’s about the fact that he was perfectly fine lying to me for months instead of just being honest. He knew how important ambition is to me. He knew I was under the impression that he was at least *trying.* And he still chose to sit back, do nothing, and hope I wouldn’t notice.

I confronted him about it, and his response just made it worse. He said he “didn’t want to disappoint me” and that every time he thought about applying, he got too anxious and put it off. He then turned it around on me, saying that my “grind mindset” makes him feel pressured and that he was afraid to tell me because he knew I’d judge him.

The thing is, he’s right. I *do* judge him for this. Not because I expect perfection, but because I expect basic effort. I don’t care if he doesn’t have a six-figure internship lined up, but I *do* care that he’s perfectly comfortable coasting through life while lying about it.

Now I don’t know what to do. A huge part of me wants to just walk away because I feel like I’m dating someone I can’t respect anymore. Another part of me wonders if I’m being too harsh, if I should be more understanding, or if there’s a way to fix this.

 Btw I tend to be in my own world sometimes, and get startled easily. Maybe he thought THIS wouldn’t startled me ? We also don’t work in the same department anymore so maybe he felt more comfortable to touch me now, which is ok, but not like that ? Maybe I’m overthinking, but He could have just say “ hi” or maybe a gentle poke or touch or maybe nothing ? 
I honestly didn’t like that because it made be feel inferior. I didn’t see this as sexual harassment or any form of harassment, but it felt disrespectful.

Last night she told me that she is grabbing coffee with a separate guy today that was not mentioned previously. Apparently he does not live in the country and he “seemed cool” and was only able to hang out then before he went back to his country.  Unsure what the original plan would have been. 


Am I being controlling or possessive in thinking that it’s strange that she’s going to meet up for coffee with a stranger that she met at a business conference event? 

It did not sound work-related with how she described it, nor is their focus really related business-wise. I do not know if she mentioned being in a relationship. 

To me this feels like a date or a pre-date. 

She has been wanting to make more friends but I am confused as to why she would be trying to pursue a friendship with someone who doesn’t live in the country.
