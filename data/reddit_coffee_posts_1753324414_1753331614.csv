1m7uw6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TripWanderers/comments/1m7uw6n/is_miami_worth_a_trip/,Is Miami worth a trip?,"Living in Miami for the past 5 years has given me a unique perspective on what this vibrant city truly offers. While many people know Miami for its beaches and nightlife, there's so much more that makes this city worth visiting.

The weather is practically perfect year-round, with temperatures usually hovering between 75-85°F. Even during winter, you can comfortably wear shorts and enjoy outdoor activities. This consistent climate is one of the main reasons I fell in love with Miami.

Beyond the famous South Beach scene, Miami's diverse neighborhoods each tell their own story. Little Havana pulses with Cuban culture, offering authentic food and the best Cuban coffee you'll ever taste. Wynwood has transformed from a warehouse district into an open-air art gallery, with stunning murals covering nearly every wall.

But the real hidden gem - and my personal favorite - is the Everglades National Park. It's mind-blowing to have this natural wonder just 45 minutes from downtown Miami. I recently took some friends on an airboat tour at Gator Park, and it was absolutely incredible. The 40-minute ride through the ""River of Grass"" got us up close with alligators, exotic birds, and even turtles sunbathing on logs.

The wildlife show afterward was both entertaining and educational. Watching the alligator handling demonstrations while learning about these fascinating creatures was a highlight for everyone. My friends couldn't stop talking about getting their picture taken with ""Jaws,"" the famous resident gator.

If you're planning to visit, I highly recommend booking the Everglades tour through this link: https://athometouch.com/miami. I've found it to be the best value, starting at $42 per person, and they offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before.

The food scene here is incredibly diverse. From high-end restaurants in Brickell to local food trucks serving Caribbean specialties, there's something for every palate and budget. The fusion of Latin American, Caribbean, and American cuisines creates unique flavors you won't find anywhere else.

Miami's cultural scene is booming too. The Pérez Art Museum, the Frost Science Museum, and countless galleries showcase both local and international talent. During Art Basel in December, the city becomes the global center of the art world.

Transportation is getting better with the Brightline train connecting Miami to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Getting around the city is easier than ever, though I still recommend renting a car if you plan to explore beyond downtown.

Is Miami worth visiting? Absolutely. Whether you're interested in nature, culture, food, or just want to relax on beautiful beaches, Miami offers experiences you won't find anywhere else in the US. Just remember to pack sunscreen and stay hydrated - the Florida sun is no joke!

Pro tip: Visit between November and April for the best weather. Hurricane season (June to November) can be unpredictable, though hotels often offer great deals during this time.

Bottom line: Miami isn't just worth visiting - it's an experience that will leave you planning your next trip before the first one ends.",1,1753331384.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False
1m7uv1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/1m7uv1p/how_i_psyopd_my_brain_into_becoming_the_person_i/,How I psyop’d my brain into becoming the person I used to envy:  reading and gym rewired my reality,"Two years ago I was chronically exhausted, scrolling through TikTok until 2AM, skipping workouts, and saying yes to things I didn’t even want to do. My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins:  It’s not just about toughness, it’s about identity. Goggins literally rewired his brain through action. His “cookie jar” method (collecting proof of your resilience) helped me build confidence from small wins. I used to think I wasn’t built like that. This book showed me I could be.

BeFreed: My friend put me on this smart reading app developed by scientists from Columbia. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, lowkey addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.

Huberman Lab: Dr. Andrew Huberman shares science-backed tips for rewiring your brain for focus, discipline, and energy. His stuff on dopamine and routines changed how I approached mornings. I used his cold exposure + NSDR + gym combo to reset my brain. Best free education on the internet.

Modern Wisdom: Chris Williamson interviews thinkers like Naval, Cal Newport, and Jordan Peterson. His conversations go deep into psychology, self-mastery, and discipline. I listen while lifting or meal prepping, beats music, and I always leave with a mental upgrade.

I used to scroll to escape myself. Now I read to evolve. Changing your life isn’t about forcing discipline. It’s about feeding your brain a new story until it believes it’s true. Once it does, it wants to help you succeed.

Lately, I've been caught up in this feeling... maybe you know it too? It's like being a tiny little speck in this mind-blowingly vast universe and wondering, ""Does my presence here really matter in the grand scheme of things?"" I mean, we've all probably had those days where we feel kinda insignificant, right?

But something hit me the other day while I was sipping my favorite overly complicated coffee order. If every little part of this universe is connected somehow—like how stars are made of the same stuff we're made of—then maybe we're not as alone as we feel. I read somewhere about particles being bound across galaxies or whatever, and it's like, maybe we're part of something bigger that we can't totally see or understand yet.

I don't exactly know where I'm going with this... but I felt like I had to share it with someone, even if it's just the void, or maybe you. There’s a sort of comfort in thinking we’re all threads in this cosmic tapestry—intertwined, in ways obvious and hidden. Does that make any sense? Who knows tho? 🤔

Anyway, thanks for letting me throw this fluttering thought out into the universe. Maybe it lands somewhere, or stays floating, but either way, it feels good to share. Take care, whomever you are.",5,1753331137.0,LettersToStrangers,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1m7uqmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1m7uqmx/end_of_the_line/,"End of the line,","I've been playing TTRPGs since I was 12. I was discovering fantasy fiction, and bonded with my uncle over Terry Pratchett. I played my first one-shot that evening, using the 3.5 starter set. I played Tordek the Dwarf. Tordek kicked a bugbear into a vat of acid. I don't know why I remember that specific detail so well, but it's my first actual memory of TTRPGs.

Visits weren't regular, and my uncle was often working. But I kept asking to play and my uncle would break out the starter set if possible. He called my mum and dads house one evening. As long as I was good and did my homework etc, I could do a little bit of our dungeon game over the phone from time to time. Next time I saw him at his place he gave me a pencil case with a bunch of dice in. And showed me a book with a big scary zombie king on it. He explained to 12 year old me that rather than trying to make an entire adventure fit into a 20 minutes phone call, this story would be a longer one but we were telling it in bits.

My uncle simplified a lot of rules but he did insist I understand my character sheet and try to remember which dice I was supposed to roll for things. I didn't look at Character classes and I never levelled up, I would just acquire new powers and weapons. The rules weren't actually that important But I did learn which dice i rolled to do damage with my lightning sword and I understood my character wasn't good at everything. I had to do some problem solving and it wasn't the DM's job to just grant my wishes and so on.

It took me about 8 months of phone calls and the occasional face to face session. 2 PCs were ""taken prisoner"" and I had to roll a couple of new characters. But eventually I confronted the Zombie king at the heart of underground labyrinth I had learned was named The Lost City of Barakus.

I actually read the module book years later, and realise he just made a lot of stuff up! The dice rolls were correct though.

Sadly my aunt divorced him not long afterwards. I know it's not a wholesome end to the story, but he was a shitty husband. Not a monster or anything, just a bit of a waste of space.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Today I have grown more powerful than deadbeat uncle could possibly imagine!

I love tabletop gaming in general. It's an in group meme that if you are in my home, I will try and get you to play a board game you've never heard of.

I do have other hobbies, but table games are communal activities so that's what I try to get my friends in on. I get a huge kick out of introducing somebody to a board game they really engage with.

But TTRPGs are a passion of a different order. I've been a forever GM for the last ten years and I've loved it. It *is* a lot of work.

But I'm coming to terms with the fact that my best days are behind me when it comes to RPGs. Though a great majority of my stories were unfinished, I have been lucky enough to run 5 campaigns to their proper conclusion. I'm sure others have done better, but that's a decent innings in my

It's not that I will never run a game again, but I have given up on holding a campaign together. I do enjoy short adventures and capers but the development of campaign arcs is what really makes the memories both of the stories told in the fiction and the time spent with friends.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

The last campaign I ran for a decent stretch concluded just over two years ago. A trio of lads from the pub came back to my flat after closing time. The shops were closed and I had a full case of beer, . I had an old campaign notebook open on my coffee table, maps doodles and campaign diaries etc. These guys were not familiar with pen and paper RPGs at all beyond a vague awareness of the brand Dungeons and Dragons.

They're the type of lads who own an Xbox and have 7 games for it. All of those games are Fifa.

Nonetheless, the concept had caught their interest. I was pretty tanked but Ihad some creative energy so I just cobbled some character creation rules together and got to it.

Standard array of 3 4 and 5 assigned to Abilities: Body Mind and Spirit.  
There were 3 general aptitudes under each of those base stats of which they could select two.  
Body: Strength Agility and Constitution  
Mind: Comprehension, Acuity, Retention  
Spirit: Instinct, Will & Presence

I asked if they wanted to do sci-fi or fantasy. They picked Sci fi.  
I said we'll be doing a prison break (my default quickstart coz you can assume their stuff's been taken)  
I asked them all to write 5 interesting things about their characters, and how/why they ended up in prison.  
I determined 3 useful skills and 1 ""dud"" skill  for each of them based on those backgrounds. I felt like a very smart boy when they questioned their dud skills (Cookery, Gardening and Personal Finance, incidentally.) I did the RPG philosophy bit: they'd made characters to roleplay, not game pieces to move about a board, the dud skills were there for character depth and so on

Ability checks were just a case of rolling d6 equal to your basic ability score. If you had a relevant aptitude (like strength for kicking a door down) you got an extra d6. If you had a relevant skill you could set 2 dice to 6 (auto successes, basically.)

After about 2 hours of play they broke out of the prison and stole a transport. They wanted to play on, but I was ready to kick out and assumed they'd forget about it by the morning. Next time I saw Steve he gave me his number to arrange another session. We ended up sticking it out for 20-25 sessions in the end.

The trio became mercenaries for hire and got into all sorts of silly space capers. There wasn't a lot of broader narrative direction but

I developed or added rules only when necessary, and simplicity was the name of the game. They had 10 fuel units, not ""132kg.""  Never bothered with a formal character progression system, they gained ranks in their skills and got an extra basic ability point abouthalf way through and they were happy with that.

I don't mind dense rulebooks. But it was super liberating, not just to have a ruleset so slim, but players who didn't care about how ""good"" the rules were as long as they were applied consistently.

They became known as ""The Black Hole Surfers."" They were interplanetary fuck-not-givers who consistently demonstrated disdain for their fellow citizens. But they were just tough guys in a tough cosmos. This changed when a return client turned out to have massive interests in the Sectors underground lave trade and they went on a bit of a Robin Hood Arc which was actually very character driven. After that their interest started to waver. So I decided a war had started (no foreshadowing for this aside from ""establishment space government bad themes) throughout. The Surfers became reluctant heroes in a revolutionary movement. Big space battle at the end, very derivative and an absolute riot.  I made them shit themselves by breaking out a d10 damage dice for the cannon on the evil space capitalist's flagship. Only non d6 dice rolled in the entire campaign and they rolled a 10 and a 17. The blast wrecked their vessel, so they Kirk manuevered (detonated their main reactor) it at point blank as a final gambit to disable it's shield, which succeeded (on fiat, they rolled dice but I wasn't gonna let them lose now. The revolutionaries asked them to stay and support the revolution, but the Surfers refused. They asked for a small ship for their trouble and headed for the stars.

\-FIN-

Messy plot, paper thin rules, derivative and predictable scenarios, rushed ending

10/10, wouldn't change a thing.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Toward the end of last year I did make a sincere effort to organise a Call of Cthulu group to do an anthology of adventures with  that lasted 6 sessions, four of which I GM'd. After that I'm accepting that I will probably never run an extended campaign again. If I do, it will probably be with my children in the unlikely event we change our mind about not wanting them.

I WAS asked to GM some sessions of Mothership by someone I forgot existed in February. It was pretty out of the blue but I'm glad I was asked because the sessions were fun and the group was easy going and friendly. I highly recommend the RPG itself, easy to pick up and well designed mechanically. Although we were playing over Discord and the whole thing just dissolved. I would have loved to build a proper adventure from the ground up in the system as well.

My OG DnD tablemates are still pretty tight, we're pretty spread out nowadays but we get together on Zoom or Discord a few times a year. We'll sometimes run a oneshot, we mix up the editions and there's lots of inside jokes that date back years, recurring characters and so on. They are fun sessions (even when Charlie gets his way and we play 4th ed.)

My situation is not remarkable, but I wish I'd seen it coming. I feel I should have.

TTRPGs are a high maintenance hobby.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  
**Affirmations - Why I was such an amazing GM.**

I was an S Tier GM, one of the greats.

That's not just my opinion. I WAS that good.

If you want to find somebody who's played at my table that didn't think it was an awesome experience you'll have to visit the Mirror Universe.

My players got the best the hobby has to offer.

I put effort into the craft and I have brought joy to others through my specific mastery of the craft.

My players never cancelled.

My players arrived early and their phones didn't leave their pockets until I called a break.

My players got invested in the worlds and stories I presented because I presented worlds and stories worth getting invested in.

My players will recall my games fondly in their winter years.

I was asked to run a Mothership campaign by somebody who played in a VTM chronicle I ran on Discord for a bunch of guys I met on Rainbow Six Siege over the Covid years.  
I had literally forgotten he existed, but I believe he got his lo-fi chic space horror RPG and remembered playing my kinda camp gothic vampire action drama campaign from nearly half a decade ago and it stuck with him.

I kept three very unlikely players interested in an off the cuff sci-fi campaign for more then 20 session with a ruleset that would fit on a cocktail napkin. I wouldn't care to bet on if they'll ever play another tabletop RPG, but I am as proud of that campaign as I am any other

This post is not important in any grander scheme.  
Lots of people sacrifice hobbies they don't have time for.  
My experience is not unique, I just want to post some performative melodrama on the internet,  
That's some weapons grade centrifugally concentrated cringe, right there! How dare I be so concieted!  
I should just get over myself and stop spouting pretentious nonsense.

1m7uqh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfcare/comments/1m7uqh6/how_i_psyopd_my_brain_into_becoming_the_person_i/,How I psyop’d my brain into becoming the person I used to envy:  reading and gym rewired my reality,"Two years ago I was chronically exhausted, scrolling through TikTok until 2AM, skipping workouts, and saying yes to things I didn’t even want to do. My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins:  It’s not just about toughness, it’s about identity. Goggins literally rewired his brain through action. His “cookie jar” method (collecting proof of your resilience) helped me build confidence from small wins. I used to think I wasn’t built like that. This book showed me I could be.

BeFreed: My friend put me on this smart reading app developed by scientists from Columbia. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, lowkey addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.

Huberman Lab: Dr. Andrew Huberman shares science-backed tips for rewiring your brain for focus, discipline, and energy. His stuff on dopamine and routines changed how I approached mornings. I used his cold exposure + NSDR + gym combo to reset my brain. Best free education on the internet.

Modern Wisdom: Chris Williamson interviews thinkers like Naval, Cal Newport, and Jordan Peterson. His conversations go deep into psychology, self-mastery, and discipline. I listen while lifting or meal prepping, beats music, and I always leave with a mental upgrade.

I used to scroll to escape myself. Now I read to evolve. Changing your life isn’t about forcing discipline. It’s about feeding your brain a new story until it believes it’s true. Once it does, it wants to help you succeed.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1m7upkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1m7upkq/extreme_loneliness_after_nc/,extreme loneliness after NC,"I didn’t just go NC with family, I somehow managed to cut off everyone. 






When the abuse in the family started to ramp
up, I knew I had to get out as fast as possible. I was getting sicker and weaker by the year. 

After escaping the family’s  clutches in 2022, I decided to change my number. I figured if someone really cares they can find me on socials or email me. 

No one did.

I’ve never been this alone in my entire life.

I was in a very fragile and heightened state the first year NC. Starting to feel like I was too rash in changing my number. 

I actually have a lot of friendship trauma, I’ve realized since inventorying my past relationships. But nevertheless 

I don’t go to weddings anymore; haven’t been invited to any baby showers. I don’t get coffee with anyone. I don’t FaceTime with anyone. I used to go to a lot of social events with the fake gossipy community surrounding my parents but since I went NC I don’t get invited to anything. The  last remaining friends I had slipped away… because  I started being my authentic self and they couldn’t handle it. 




Even if I try to make a friend it’s usually crumbles within 2 years. So I’ve stopped trying.

tldr: I am extremely lonely after going NC and rashly changing my number. Somehow the pandemic hit, I blinked and my life is now completely devoid of companionship. 

I fear even if I do make friends my subconscious desperation will attract other unhealthy / unstable types.

About me. I’m 36, white, 6 foot tall, slim frame quite tattooed, shaved head and face. My girlfriend would agree that I carry a lot of feminine energy. Biologically I am a male but I sometimes think I have a little old lady trapped inside of me. I have my hobbies but over the years I have had to accept that I am aging and my body doesn’t agree with being extremely active anymore. In my brain, I’d like to go skateboarding, indoor rock climb, hike, play disc golf, and go for walks every day but most of the time I’m taking it very easy on the couch or doing low energy activities elsewhere. I have ulcerative colitis (since I was 12) and was recently diagnosed with Crohn’s too. I had my large intestine removed at 15. Sometimes I visit the doctor a lot, and sometimes I am okay. Regardless, I’m not in tip top shape but I try to be the best I can be. 

Like I said before, most of my days are lower level activities. Those can be short walks, aimless drives, watching random things on YouTube, TV, Movies, or reading a book. I’m
Not a city boy and most of my day trips or adventures involve leaving the city, not going deeper into it. I already live way up in west Philly, bordering bala cynwyd and it’s nice and quiet just how I like. In summer my primary interest is being at the beach. I love the beach. I would live at the beach if my finances allowed it. Give me a cooler of seltzer and ice coffee, an umbrella, and I’m set. I am a huge fan of nude beaches and try to make a trip to gunnison whenever I can but it’s not often enough. I’m cool with other beaches too, but try to stay away from the party crowd because I’m not a party person. 

I do not drink because it doesn’t agree with my health issues. I am typically asleep by midnight, up around 8. I have a pretty dang good sleep schedule and it’s been that way for years. I don’t smoke cigarettes but I do use a nicotine vaporizer. I will occasionally dabble in THC but my tolerance took a dive years ago and I can barely take a hit off of a joint without feeling like I’m having a panic attack. Maybe some mushrooms once every few years but I’m just not into substances past my nicotine and coffee. I don’t really do loud spaces at all anymore. I may do a show once in a blue moon but something kicked in at some point not long ago and I decided loud crowded confined spaces cause me distress. I’m pretty boring for some folks in this department.  

I have a girlfriend who I actually met here! She’s wonderful and I love her deeply. We are not looking for a third. I live in a kitchen table type of dynamic with her husband, two cats and a Pom. I say polyamorous but we are open. I’m not active in the community and don’t particularly care for big poly groups or polysaturated type of dynamics. I really crave quality time and have difficulty with people that cannot make enough time get that quirky with me. I wouldn’t like to bring a new partner to my home. My girlfriend would like to meet my partner, but I would prefer to keep my relationships separate. 

I love spending time at home with my girlfriend but we are different people with different interests. While I am somewhat of a homebody, my girlfriend is more. I would love to have a partner to spend a couple days out of the week with. 

I never went to college. My health was priority and it never allowed me to have the mindset to seek a higher education. I do have an interesting job and currently only work the college football season. I work in live television broadcasting and travel with a crew throughout the states. August to December can be hectic and I’m only home a couple days each week. After that, it’s funemployment and taking local day gigs. 

While I work in sports, I’m not a die hard. I have very limited knowledge on most sports and it’s not something that I have a great interest in. I’ll go to a Phillies game or whatever but I’m not like, a SPORTS guy. Skateboarding is the only thing I have extensive knowledge on because I’ve been doing it since I was 10. 

I am vegetarian! My girlfriend is vegan. I have been veg for maybe a decade now and don’t plan on going back to eating meat. I would love a partner that has a similar mindset but prefer those who aren’t militant in their beliefs. 

It should go without saying but I’m liberal, well, leftist. Reluctantly voting for democrats because they’re closest in my ideology who can get us closer to what I believe is right. I’m not a political freak though and I do not obsess or make it my entire personality. I have my beliefs and will fight for them but I’m not an extremist. 

For partners, I like feminine presenting people and that’s about it. Obviously I’d like someone why shares common interests but physically, past being a feminine presenting person, I’m not “picky”. I will need someone who is patient with my job and health though. I don’t need a caretaker but some compassion and understanding is nice. 

I am a sexual person and have my kinks but I’m not a really kinky individual. Vanilla sex is just a good as kink to me. I’ve never had a requirement for my pleasure. I am dominant leaning but that’s not a hard line although I prefer to be the dominant person when it comes to kinks. I’m a giver and take a lot of pleasure giving others pleasure. Mostly I like light bondage, impact play and some sensory play. Again, all giving. I am not particularly fond of brats or pillow princesses. Not hating on those types or people but I do like someone that considers my needs too. Safety is huge to me. I love casual sex but I get tested and am not a very promiscuous person but I do go through my man slut phases. I’m not actively seeking random hookups and feel like I’m quite sexually satisfied with my girlfriend as it is to feel the need of something like a one night stand. I’m plenty happy with just masturbating if I just need to have an orgasm and go about my day. 

This post is already way too long and I don’t even know if anyone has the attention span anymore to read this so I’ll leave it at that. If this post resonates with you and you, send me a message and we can play 21 questions. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

I attended a service on September 22 of last year I was still interested in it for a while after. Tried to watch the general convince but didn't have time. And then I slowly stopped talking to the missionaries. And then in January I retired and for some reason these missionaries were very professional and it put me off for a bit but the idea stayed in the back of my mind. Since then my friend no longer acknowledges the church or God but still goes to church. And my point I am bringing up is I kinda want to start to try again but I wonder how he'll react because me and him skateboard all the time together.

1m7ujdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MutualfundsIndia/comments/1m7ujdg/case_study_portfolio_review_from_a_50_security/,Case Study & Portfolio Review: From a 50+ Security Mess to a 5-Fund High-Conviction Strategy,"Hey r/MutualfundsIndia ,

I'm hoping this post can serve two purposes: first, to get your feedback on my newly structured portfolio, and second, to serve as a detailed case study for others who might be struggling with portfolio complexity.

After realising my investment approach was chaotic and inefficient, I've spent the last month developing a disciplined, long-term framework. I'm now ready to consolidate and execute.

**Preface & Profile:**

* **Age & Profession:** 29, Software Engineer
* **Goal:** Aggressive long-term (20-30 years) wealth creation.
* **Risk Profile:** High. My financial foundation is secure, allowing me to view significant market downturns as rare buying opportunities.

**The Issue & Consolidation (The ""Before"" Picture)**

Until now, my portfolio has been a complete mess. It was a chaotic collection of:

* 60% in direct equity (\~35+ stocks) from a fund manager and my own ""hot"" picks.
* 40% in mutual funds (\~15+ funds) with no clear strategy.

The result? The entire setup was a nightmare to track and a constant source of low-grade stress. My direct equity portfolio couldn't even beat the index, the winners were cancelled out by the losers (""diworsification"" at its finest), and I was paying fees for the privilege of underperforming.

This chaos directly conflicted with my professional life. As a software engineer, my mind is wired to build systems. My real passion is my entrepreneurial push to discover and build new tech companies. Trying to track dozens of businesses and second-guess market movements felt like running a second, high-stress job I was terrible at.

**The Realisation: I'm Betting on Myself**

The turning point was a simple but profound realisation. Instead of spending my precious time constantly monitoring companies and trying to learn the art of stock picking, I decided to make a different bet: a bet on myself.

I've had exceptional growth in my career as a software engineer, and I have immense conviction in my entrepreneurial journey. That is my true alpha, my primary engine for wealth creation. I decided my most valuable investment, my time, should be funnelled there. My savings, in turn, should be put on autopilot, managed by professionals I hire for the job.

**The Ideology: Moving from Amateur to CEO**

My new investment philosophy is built on a few core principles: discipline, patience, and recognising the limits of my own time and expertise. The goal is to stop being a frantic stock-picker and instead act as the **CEO of my portfolio**. My job isn't to analyse 50 different companies but to hire 4-5 of the best professional fund managers in the country to do that work for me.

**The New Strategy: A Disciplined, MF-First Approach**

The first step was to take control. I ended my subscription with the fund manager and decided to go back to first principles. I spent dedicated time learning the fundamentals of long-term investing, not about picking individual stocks, but about sound portfolio construction. Through this research, I developed my own mutual fund selection framework based on clear quantitative (performance, risk ratios) and qualitative (philosophy, manager tenure) metrics.

I've decided to consolidate everything and channel 90% of my monthly equity investments into a core Mutual Fund portfolio.

**Why Not Pick Stocks Actively?** I will still pick stocks, but not as my primary strategy. My direct equity allocation will be managed via a **""Coffee Can / War Chest""** approach. I'll systematically save a small amount into a separate account and deploy it *infrequently* and *opportunistically* into 2-3 high-conviction businesses a year that I plan to hold for 10+ years. This avoids impulsive buying and forces a long-term mindset.

**The Complete Financial Picture**

My new plan recognises that MFs are just one part of the puzzle. The full picture looks like this:

* **Foundation (Low Risk):** I have a solid base in NPS, PPF, FDs, ULIP and Gold. This is my defensive bedrock that allows me to be aggressive elsewhere. (I know ULIP was a mistake, but the math says that the best course of action is to continue)
* **Core Wealth Builder (High Risk):** The 90% allocation of my monthly investments into the MF portfolio detailed below.
* **Satellites (Very High Risk):** A 10% monthly allocation to Crypto (BTC/ETH) and the opportunistic ""Coffee Can"" stock portfolio.

**The Final Mutual Fund Portfolio**

After a rigorous, multi-phase screening process, this is the final 5-fund portfolio I've built.

|Fund Category|Allocation|Fund Name|Role & Rationale|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Large Cap**|20%|**Bandhan Nifty 100 Index Fund**|**The Passive Bedrock.** Captures the market return of India's top 100 companies at a best-in-class expense ratio of 0.10%.|
|**Flexi Cap**|25%|**Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund**|**The Active Core.** A high-quality, value-conscious fund with built-in global diversification, run by a highly respected team.|
|**Mid Cap**|30%|**Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund**|**The Primary Growth Engine.** A high-conviction, concentrated fund with stellar performance metrics, chosen to be the main driver of alpha.|
|**Small Cap**|15%|**Bandhan Small Cap Fund**|**The Potent Accelerator.** An aggressive, high-alpha fund. Chosen after accepting the ""manager tenure risk"" in exchange for superior performance and risk metrics.|
|**International**|10%|**5% S&P 500 + 5% Nasdaq 100**|**The Diversifier & Tech Bet.** A hybrid approach to get broad US market exposure while expressing a bullish view on US tech.|

**My Questions for the Community:**

1. **Fund Selection:** Are there any funds in this final list you would strongly consider replacing? If so, which one, what alternative would you suggest, and what is your reasoning?
2. **Small Cap Rationale:** Regarding the Small Cap choice, I consciously chose Bandhan over others due to its superior risk-adjusted performance, despite the known ""manager tenure risk."" How do you weigh this trade-off between a statistically superior choice and one with a longer, more stable track record?
3. **ETF vs. Index Fund:** On a practical note for my Large Cap allocation, does anyone have a case study or real-world experience comparing a **NIFTY 100 ETF** directly against an **Index Fund**? I'm particularly interested in the effective difference in tracking error, liquidity, and overall costs (including brokerage, STT, etc.) for a long-term SIP investor. How about picking index funds for Mid and Small cap as well?
4. **Blind Spots:** Looking at the overall structure and my philosophy, are there any major blind spots or risks you feel I might be overlooking?

Any other critiques or suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your time and insights!",1,1753330211.0,MutualfundsIndia,0,1.0,False

I’m 32F, no major medical conditions. But for the last couple years, I was *exhausted*. I could sleep 9 hours and still feel like a zombie. I had mood swings, zero libido, my face looked puffy all the time, and my brain felt… slow. I’d forget why I walked into a room. And yet, every time I went to the doctor, my labs were “normal.”

I started wondering if it was burnout or just life post - 30, but something didn’t feel right.

Eventually I went to a functional medicine NP, and while nothing was “clinically wrong,” she showed me I had low-normal thyroid markers and borderline vitamin deficiencies. She didn’t push meds but instead suggested some daily changes.

Here’s what REALLY helped me over the next 90 days:

* **Iodine + vitamin A. Together** : never knew how connected they were to thyroid. Took a spray form under the tongue.
* Cut out seed oils, added more whole eggs, avocado, and grass-fed meat.
* Switched coffee to mid-morning instead of first thing on an empty stomach.
* Walked outside first thing every morning for 10 mins.
* Started journaling my symptoms daily (I thought this was silly, but it helped so much.)

I’m not claiming this fixed everything, but my energy is 80% better, I’m mentally sharper, and my cycle is pretty regulated for the first time in months.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/GMjPPWRWiG): **June 8, 2025**

I know this is going to sound fucking wacky but I'm really at a loss at what I or my family can do.

I (30F) have a cousin (28F, we'll call her 'Willow') who announced her pregnancy late last year. She *should* be due in the next month or so, but my family is having huge doubts that she's actually pregnant.

I really should stress that we're not close at all; we were raised together up until I was around six but I genuinely haven't spoken to her in decades due to distance. My mom however, is close to Willow's older sister 'Zara'. Excluding my mom, we all live in the same city.

My mom has been really worried about Willow and shared some new information with me I didn't know about.

\- last April Willow made a post about how she would block anyone who made a fake pregnancy post for April Fools Day, because she recently found out she was 'infertile' (very vague, her exact words were 'i found out I can't carry children). She eventually deleted that post, then a few months later announced she was pregnant.

\- she's not in a relationship and hasn't revealed who the father is. Our family genuinely wouldn't have a problem with her having a child out of wedlock or whatever, but she's being super cagey about his identity. She floated IVF around at first but a) there's no way she could have afforded that & b) she refuses to confirm or deny it.

\- Willow is the kind of person who loves taking pictures and daily selfies for Insta (no shade, just setting the scene); ever since she made the announcement, she hasn't posted ANY photos of herself. My mom thought that was really weird -- as excited as Willow is to be a mom, shouldn't she be taking more pictures of her baby bump?

\- no one has seen Willow in person since she announced the pregnancy. She was pretty close with her sisters Yasmin & Zara, but suddenly she's been impossible to meet up with. If they offer to drop food off for her lunch (she works in a demanding field), she has a million reasons why they can't come by, despite them being more than welcome pre-announcement.

\- she had a baby shower a few weeks ago that was being organized by a friend of hers. On the day of the shower, our family members arrived to the listed address, but couldn't find the party. They called/texted her to ask for her to come out to find them, and she BLOCKED THEM. They never got to see her.

\- Willow announced that she's having a second baby shower, but that it's going to be in a completely different city. It's not even close to her hometown, where her family still lives.

My concern is that Willow might be going through some kind of mental health crisis -- my mom is also afraid she might try to kidnap an infant or hurt someone.

I guess I don't know how to approach this situation and I'm looking for advice; at best, maybe she had a one night stand and she's ashamed, but that wouldn't explain her refusing to see us. She could be lying, but she has a baby registry and everything. She could be planning to adopt, but again our family really wouldn't have an issue with that so it still doesn't explain her secrecy. Or again, she's having a mental health crisis and needs professional help.

She recently moved and hasn't given anyone her address, and her job is in an office building that has private parking, so I don't think we could catch her going to or from work without creating an incident, and I wouldn't want to put her job in jeopardy for nothing. What should we do?

Tl;dr -- Cousin has been incredibly secretive about her pregnancy, and we think she might be faking it. How can we help?

\--

Small Update: I managed to get ahold of Willow's friend and I'm going to be meeting up with them this week to pass along a gift basket for Willow and voice my concerns. I did find out Willow has also started her maternity leave and is due in the coming weeks (though of course this is still through word of mouth from her friend, who doesn't work with her).

I REALLY want to stress that I hope we're all wrong about this; while I'm still hopeful that this is all stemming from some sort of anxiety over what I think is a high risk pregnancy, I would feel like absolute shit if it turned out that Willow is going through a mental health crisis alone.

Thank you to everyone who advised me on how to approach this; when I speak to her friend I will focus on wanting to support Willow however she needs, and that we just want her to be happy and healthy, then go from there.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** If you know what time she gets off work, you could have someone she wouldn't recognize follow her when she leaves the lot. Even if they can't catch a look at her once she's home, you'll at least know where she lives and can plan further steps from there. It does sound like she's possibly having a mental health crisis. Her sisters may need to step in once you have her new address.

> **OOP:** I'm trying to be vague about her job, but due to the field she's in she could be working at all hours of the day. I also was wondering if she might be on maternity leave? She's been so cagey about how far along she is, but she has to be within her third trimester by now.

**Commenter 2:** Honestly, given the weirdness of no one showing up and wrong address mix-up, it's also the polite thing to do to call the host to apologize and explain why no one came. 

The non-mental health concerning possibility is that you guys should have contacted the host if you couldn't find the house and not been bothering her, a pregnant woman and who the party was for, to come outside. That might also explain the blocking you guys and being ignored. Just something to also keep in mind.

> **OOP:** That's what's really messing me up about this -- Willow is the one who invited everyone and insisted on contact through her, not the friend who actually hosted the party. The number Willow listed on the invitations and shower page was hers, not the hostess.
> 
> I guess I'm also afraid that maybe her sisters haven't given us the full story and have done something to overstep/harass her, but why would she keep inviting us to her baby events if that was the case? (we've all been invited to the second shower as well)

**Commenter 3:** Are you sure she’s not in a relationship?

Because while this does sound like a mental health crisis… it also sounds like the way someone isolates themselves in an abusive relationship. If she’s with a new guy who’s super controlling, everything still makes sense.

> **OOP:** Pretty sure I think -- she makes posts about looking for a partner who will treat her right, or how she's enjoying her solitude and won't break it for just anyone, that sort of thing.

**OOP explains more about how it came to her living in the same city with her cousins and how she received the invitation if she hasn't seen Willow in years**

> **OOP:** Willow moved to this city at the beginning of last year for work (I moved here when I was little) -- our hometown where she grew up is 300+ miles from here.
> 
> And honestly, I agree with you on the invitation thing. I assumed that I was invited because my mom is closer to Willow and her sisters, but since she doesn't live in our state anymore, I got the invite instead. Our family is really big, so something like that is pretty normal for us.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/p1vq7d52Wu): **July 17, 2025 (a little over a month later)**

UPDATE - My family and I (30F) think my cousin (28F) might be faking her pregnancy. What can we do?

About a month ago I posted here asking for advice regarding my cousin Willow and some concerning behaviors my family had noticed. You can look at it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/alMOR0U8gy) for the details.

I didn't address all of the questions in the comments but I did want to clear up a few things:

\- ""If you aren't close to Willow, why are you getting involved?""

I wasn't completely forthcoming with Willow & I's ages & backstory for privacies sake; we're actually both the same age, born a few weeks apart. Girls are really rare in my family so when we were younger we were raised together in my hometown (we come from a big ass country family) before I moved 300+ miles away.

My mother and I visited in the summer until I entered high school, and Willow was (& is still) very close with her. Willow and I spent time together too, but there was always a bit of a disconnect between us due to interests and distance. To her, I was the only female family member her age to do all the feminine things she didn't get to do with her brother during the school year (manicures, playing dress up, etc); to me, summertime in the country was my opportunity to roll around in the dirt, bike to the river and let me hair turn into a rats nest. My mom was always happy to do that kind of stuff with Willow when I would refuse, and that's how they bonded.

With my mom living across the country now, she's effectively been asking me to help check up on Willow in her stead.

\- ""How do you know she doesn't have the money for IVF?""

A month or so before her pregnancy announcement, she had to downsize her apartment and traded in her car for one that had a lower monthly payment and told her sisters that it was becoming too expensive on just her income alone. She also mentioned that she hardly had any savings at the time, because she paid off her student loans in one lump sum.

\- What about her mom/dad? How are you the 'only closely aged girl in the family' if she has sisters?

It's kind of complicated -- Willow & her sisters have different moms, and they have a pretty significant age gap between the siblings (Willow has a brother close in age, but the rest of her brothers and sisters are minimum 20 years older than Willow); furthermore Willow's mom has suffered from major medical issues for awhile so Willow's maternal grandparent (who is very old now) was her primary guardian growing up.

Willow's dad (my great uncle) passed away over twenty years ago; my mom was his niece. So technically we're first cousins once removed. To demonstrate the age gap a different way, Willow's sisters are the older cousins my mom grew up with.

-------------

Hope that answers some questions. As far as the update itself goes, there's still a LOT happening but here's the main bits.

As per the advice I got from commenters here, I reached out to the host of the baby shower (Francine), who is a friend of Willow's, and asked if we could meet up so I could give her a gift basket for Willow.

We met at a coffee place, exchanged pleasantries, etc, before I shared my concerns about Willow. I reassured Francine that I just wanted to make sure Willow was okay, and that if her reticence towards us was due to some fault on our end, I would back off. Francine looked really uncomfortable while I was asking all of this, and made me promise that I wouldn't tell Willow where I got this information from before she started showing me her & Willow's text messages.

In a nutshell, the baby is real; Willow had a ONS with an older guy (George) who's in a managerial position at her job and she got pregnant. He's in a different department than her, but the two departments basically share the same office space.

Initially George didn't want anything to do with the baby, and Willow agreed that she'd raise it alone; however, I guess he ended up talking to his mom (Martha) about it and she began pressuring him to get involved. George's a widower with no children, so it seems Martha feels like this will be her only opportunity to have a grandchild.

The few ultrasound pictures Willow gave George were promptly shared all over social media by Martha, effectively doxxing her. Martha and some of her friends started messaging and pressuring Willow to enter a real relationship with her son, so that 'Martha's only grandchild wouldn't be born a bastard'. Additionally, Martha started showing up every other day to their office to have lunch with George, but would use the opportunity to continue to pressure Willow for more information about her pregnancy. Willow didn't go to HR because she was afraid that she'd lose her job for improper fraternization.

So Willow basically went ghost on social media to keep Martha from stealing her pictures/harassing her, and refused to let her sisters show up for lunch, because she didn't want them to run into Martha. She's feeling very ashamed of how this is all playing out and doesn't want her sisters to escalate the situation (which to be fair, is a genuine concern -- her sisters are former college basketball players and are NOT afraid to throw hands).

George is very lukewarm on the whole thing; he doesn't want to be an active dad but wants Willow to put him on the birth certificate so that his family (AKA Martha) can have access to the baby. He's willing to pay child support, but Willow doesn't trust Martha to respect her boundaries. The dude pretty much only reaches out to Willow when Martha tells him to.

The baby shower(s) was kind of the last straw between Willow & George -- the first shower was going to be for Willow's family and friends, while the second was for George's family. Francine, who used to be Willow's coworker, agreed to host it at her condo.

George asked if he could drop off a gift before the party started and Willow agreed, so long as he left before her guests arrived. So naturally, he arrives 20 minutes into the event with Martha and some of her friends in tow, fully expecting to be greeted and treated like honored guests.

Francine and some of the other guests got into a extended screaming match with Martha & her friends; it was during this fight that Willow's sisters started calling, because they couldn't find the correct condo. Willow blocked them because she didn't want them to show up and escalate the fight. It was mortifying for Willow because none of her friends/coworkers except for Francine knew about the full situation, so that cat was now out of the bag.

The second baby shower still happened, but without Willow, lol. Martha basically threw it for herself 200 miles away, and has now been saying that she's going to fight for full custody of the baby. George is continuing to be the definition of milquetoast about his mother's escalating threats and effectively spent the last few months at work ignoring Willow unless absolutely necessary.

All of that was dropped on me on a Thursday morning at 8am.

Francine had plenty of text messages and screenshots Willow had sent them over the last 7 months corroborating her story (Willow keeps Martha muted so she can keep collecting evidence to use against her). In several of them, Willow expressed feeling too embarrassed about the whole thing to talk to our family about it.

A day or two later, Willow called me -- I had put my number in a card in the gift basket and told her that I was always here to just listen in case she felt alone or sad or angry, and that she could never disappoint me, because she's my cousin and I love her. She thanked me for the gift and we kind of tiptoed around the conversation for a while: she'd say something like ""yeah, I'm doing ok, all things considered"" and I'd respond ""that's great Willow, I know that things haven't been the easiest lately.""

Eventually she broached the topic of George and I initially pretended I didn't know anything about it, just so she could get it off her chest. We spent 5 hours on the phone talking about everything that happened and what she should do moving forward.

I showed Willow my original post and reading that my mom thought she might try to kidnap a baby made Willow laugh so hard she snorted, which honestly made my heart feel so much lighter. I also confessed that Francine told me about everything in advance, but only because we were all so worried about her.

I suggested that Willow call my mom and talk to her about everything; I reminded Willow that she raised my brother and I as a single mom too, and might have some advice to give about the legal side of things. My mom eventually shot me a message a few days later saying that Willow called and talked to her about the situation.

With all of that being said, Willow had her baby this week! Both mom and baby are healthy and heading home soon; Willow has her sisters with her in the hospital and finally told them the full story. They are (predictably) ready to pop the trunk on Martha, but first and foremost they're helping Willow look into what legal options she has to protect her baby from Martha. She hasn't told George about the birth yet but Martha has been blowing her phone up because she knows Willow is due around this time.

She has a very generous maternity leave, but afterwards Willow's considering leaving that job because of George. I think she should still report it to HR, but one step at a time.

Willow gave me permission to post this update but past that, I won't be updating anymore about Willow's situation. I really appreciate all of the advice from my original thread; all I wanted was to make sure my cousin has the support she needs and I feel like we're on the right track to being able to help her now!

Tldr; baby is real, cousin was dealing with baby daddy tomfoolery, the family is in the know now and we're helping to support her however she needs.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Stealing a baby would have been less drama than this. Yikes.

**Commenter 2:** It's just mind-blowing how your cousin is dealing with all this drama.

1m7ueqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/1m7ueqx/my_idea_for_a_game/,My idea for a Game,"Hey fellow gamers. Latley I've been trying to learn how to create my own game i want to make an isometric, rpg, monster collecting and battling game. At this point my vision is waaay larger than my skill. Anyway I've been playing with a couple ideas. I've always loved monster collecting games, and isometric RPGs, but I also like Dark humor abd watching people get offended. So I've been writing out this idea for a game. Can you tell me if its something you would play, or should I go back to the writing board?

Grimehaven

Grimehaven is  a sprawling, fictional urban wasteland. Think cyberpunk meets post apocalyptic decay, neon lit alleys, abandoned buildings, and bustling black markets. The city is alive with factions, dealers, and underground fight clubs where your ""collectibles"" let’s call them Street Spirits, (still working on the name) for a less loaded term battle for dominance.
Collectibles: Instead of the normal monster hunting games, in my game you collect Street Spirits, archetypal urban drifters with distinct personalities, backstories, and combat styles. Each has a unique vibe e.g., Meth-Mouth Marv or Cardboard Carl and evolves through exposure to various substances or environmental factors.
The tone will be darkly satirical, leaning into absurd humor and social commentary. Think Borderlands meets South Park, with a touch of urban folklore.

Gameplay Mechanics
Collection System/
Scouting: You explore the city’s districts e.g., The Neon Slums, The Docks, The Underpass, (any other location ideas are welcomed) to recruit Street Spirits. Each district has unique characters with specific traits. For example, the Docks might have Salty Sam, who wields a fishbone shiv, while the Slums have Dumpster Diva, who hurls flaming trash.

Recruitment: Instead of catching with something like Pokeballs, you lure Street Spirits with items like cheap booze, expired energy drinks, or shiny trinkets. Each Spirit has a Trust Meter that you fill by offering the right items or completing their personal quests e.g., helping Rusty Ron"" find his lost shopping cart.

Rarity: Some Spirits will be rare, like The Pigeon Whisperer, a legendary figure who controls a flock of attack pigeons, only appearing during specific in game events like a city wide blackout.

Battle System:
Street Fights: Battles take place in back alleys, abandoned lots, or underground arenas. Each Spirit has a set of moves based on their backstory and environment e.g., Bottle Toss, Sewer Splash, or Mad Rant, for psychological damage.

Team Dynamics: You can assemble a crew of up to four Spirits, each with synergy effects. For example, pairing  Screamin Sally, who disorients enemies with high-pitched yells with Chain-Swinger Chet, a melee brute, boosts their combo attacks.

Status Effects: Drugs and substances act as power-ups but come with risks. For example, giving a Spirit Blue Haze, a fictional drug might boost speed but lower defense, while Moldy Coffee, increases stamina but risks a Crash debuff.
Leveling and Evolution:

Substance System: Instead of traditional XP, Spirits level up through exposure to substances or experiences. For example:
Red Rush, a synthetic stimulant boosts attack but shortens their lifespan in battles.
Glow Juice, a bioluminescent street drug, unlocks psychic like abilities but risks addiction, reducing control in fights.
Street Wisdom, gained from completing city quests evolves Spirits into more powerful forms, like Hobo Joe, becoming King of the Curb, with a crown made of bottlecaps or broken glass.

Environmental Evolution:
Spirits evolve based on where you train them. Training in the Toxic Sewers might turn a Spirit into a poison type brawler, while the Rooftop Squats could unlock acrobatic moves.

Risk/Reward: Overdosing a Spirit on substances can lead to permanent stat loss or even retirement, they wander off into the city, never to return, adding strategic depth.

Factions and Rivalries:
The city is divided into rival gangs like the Alley Cats who are nimble thieves, the Sewer Kings are brutish tank types, and Neon Cult are mystics who worship the city’s electric grid, really just meth heads. You can align with a faction to unlock exclusive Spirits, moves, or storylines, but it locks you out of others.
Rival trainers, called Crew Bosses, challenge you in key locations, each with themed teams. For example, Boss Razor runs a crew of blade wielding Spirits in the Scrapyard District.

Additional Features
City Exploration:
Dynamic Events: The city changes based on in game time or player actions. A rainstorm might flood the sewers, spawning water type Spirits, while a heatwave could increase aggression in battles.

Black Market: Trade items, substances, or even Spirits in shady markets. Rare items like Glitter Dust, boosts charisma based attacks, are only available through risky deals that might trigger a police raid event.

Safehouses: Customize your base with scavenged furniture or defenses. You can store extra Spirits here or train them in a makeshift gym.

Story and Quests:
Main Story: You’re a nobody trying to become the city’s Underlord, the ultimate street boss. To do so, you must defeat the Council of Cranks, a group of legendary Street Spirits who control Grimehaven’s underworld.

Side Quests: Each Spirit has a personal arc. For example, helping Lost Lenny find his old guitar unlocks his Ballad of the Streets move, which buffs allies. These quests add depth and make players care about their crew.

Moral Choices: Decisions impact the city and your Spirits. Do you share your stash of Glow Juice with a struggling Spirit or hoard it for battles? Sharing might unlock loyalty bonuses but weaken your team temporarily.

Customization:
Spirit Customization: Equip Spirits with gear scavenged from the city, like a hubcap shield or a spiked jacket, which alters stats or adds new moves.

Player Avatar: Create your own street persona, choosing from styles like punk, cyber-tramp, or gutter shaman. Your look affects how NPCs and factions interact with you.
Crew Name: Name your crew e.g., The Asphalt Apostles and unlock graffiti tags to mark your territory, boosting morale in controlled districts.

Multiplayer:
Street Tournaments: Compete in online battle arenas styled like underground fight clubs. Players wager in game currency or rare items on the outcome.

Crew Wars: Team up with friends to take on rival crews in co-op battles or defend your turf in open-world PvP zones.

Trading: Trade Spirits or items via the black market, with a risk of scams e.g., receiving a fake Spirit that’s weaker than advertised.

Aesthetic and Tone will be  neon-drenched cyberpunk visuals. Think dark alleys lit by flickering signs, with Spirits animated in exaggerated, cartoonish styles to keep it playful rather than bleak.

I think for the soundtrack I'll go for Lo-fi hip hop mixed with industrial beats and distorted street sounds e.g., sirens, breaking glass. Each district has its own musical vibe, like trap for the Slums or synthwave for the Neon District.

Thats what I have so far. I'm open to any ideas and criticisms. I am aware of how large the scale of undertaking a project like this is, especially for someone who has only made a donut in blender, but it gives me something to work towards.",0,1753329817.0,rpg_gamers,2,0.5,False

**Originally posted to r/creepyencounters**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Stalking, obsessive behavior!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/s/q9lRcWhWRX)  **Feb 13, 2023**

So me and my boyfriend like going out dancing on the weekend, which always ends with us stumbling into our favourite pizza place before joining the taxi queue. We’ve done this most weekends for over a year now, so have become somewhat friendly with the guys who own the pizzeria. They know us by name and always make a big fuss over us and offer us discount every time. 

Now here’s where it gets freaky: last night, a Sunday night, at 11pm, my boyfriend and I were in bed because we both had work this morning. My phone started ringing which was weird for that time of night, and I saw it was an unknown number so ignored it. Next thing we know there’s someone knocking on the front door. All the lights in the house were off so we were clearly in bed or not in. I had another call from the same number and then the person knocking started hammering on the door and flicking the letter box. My boyfriend got up to answer it even though I was a bit shaken up and warned him not to. (If I had been alone in the house I never would’ve answered.) 

So he goes downstairs to answer the door and low and behold it’s one of the guys from the pizzeria holding 2 freshly cooked pizzas that we didn’t order. He said not to tell the other guys at the shop, but they were a gift from him to us, his favourite customers. 

My boyfriend took them from him and thanked him but we couldn’t get back to sleep for hours. We just felt so odd about it. 

We have ordered from there once for a takeaway so that’s clearly how he got our address and my phone number, but  it’s still weird right?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**[deleted]**

>Weird! I wonder if he thought you'd be home alone? Which is a scary thought. 

>I had a weird pizza delivery encounter a couple years ago. I answered the door and he fidgeted longer than needed to hand me the pizza. He didn't say anything but Idk he gave me a weird feeling, and I even said it to my roommate when I came back in. Minutes later he requests me on Facebook which creeped me the fuck out. I decided to google his name and look at his dockets (I'm a nosey bitch anyway but had to find out his deal) and the first search result is a news article about him impersonating a police officer and kidnapping someone! He had charges before that for harassment too. So now I'm a little paranoid. I think like a week later I'm pumping gas and I look over and he's at the red light just staring me down. 

>Nothing further happened, I don't think he worked there that long. But I definitely should have said something to the pizza place because someone with that record should not be a delivery driver. I'm not saying he shouldn't work, he can cook the pizza.. but like he shouldn't have access to people's info and going to their homes. I would maybe let the manager know, or maybe your bf could talk to them. Either way I'd keep alert because he came after hours, who knows if he'll do it again.

**OOP**

>>Wow that’s so creepy! I know what you mean about the weird feeling. You should always trust your gut. I’m glad nothing else untoward happened to you. They definitely shouldn’t have someone like that be able to access customer information. I wonder how often these things get over looked. It’s a scary thought. 

>>My boyfriend is going to have a word with the manager next time we’re in town. If it had been earlier in the day and he had said it was a cancelled order or something, it probably wouldn’t have been so weird, but to be out so late and literally knock us awake just to give us 2 pizzas that we didn’t order is so freaky.

**~**

**PracticalSong4452**

>That's very strange.  It seems to be a very odd time to be delivering pizzas to your house.  Maybe he thought you didn't live with your boyfriend.  My guess is that he got off work and wanted to bring you the pizzas and was hoping that you would invite him in.  ""He said not to tell the other guys at the shop"" seems suspicious as well.  He knows that what he's doing isn't professional so he's keeping his co-workers from finding out.  I think you could call the manager and tell him what happened.  That delivery guy shouldn't have access to your personal contact information and coming to your house late at night.  I'm glad your boyfriend answered that door and you were safe upstairs.

**OOP**

>>That’s such a scary thought. He has delivered to our house before when I was alone so it makes sense he was ‘checking’ to see if I lived alone. That’s pretty freaky.

**~**

**Life_Is_But_A_Dream**

>Hopefully you didn’t eat those pizzas either. You never know what he may have put on them. There was a news story in 2015 about a man who was repeatedly ejaculating into his female coworker’s coffee because he was attracted to her. Beating on your door in the middle of the night and calling persistently shows the pizza guy is a whacko. I hope you tossed those pizzas in the trash bin.

**OOP**

>>And yepp, the pizzas went in the bin the next morning

[Creepy pizza guy — Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/s/h4K3Kot2IT)  **Jan 7, 2025 (2 years later)**

I wrote a post a while back about a creepy pizza delivery guy who turned up at my house late at night with pizzas for me that I didn’t order. You can read it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/s/pDKYyhyliC

So I thought I’d provide an update for everyone who wanted one!

After the night the guy (I’ll call him Bill for now) turned up at our house, me and my partner went out for drinks a couple weeks later and ended up in the pizza shop. We noticed immediately that Bill wasn’t there, and I assumed that he was out on a delivery instead. Before we left though, the manager came out of the back and said hello, and then apologised profusely about Bill’s behaviour, and told us that he fired him. He was very thankful that we weren’t boycotting the place, and I assured him we wouldn’t because it really was the best pizza around. 

I’m not sure how the manager found out about Bill bringing the pizzas to our house, but I informed the manager about everything else that happened that night, how late it was, Bill calling my phone ect. And Manager was furious to say the least. 

He assured us that he wouldn’t be letting him work there again and my partner and I went on our way and went home. 

A few months later, we moved house (unrelated to Bill) and never heard from him again. UNTIL he showed up one night at our new house. He was delivering food for Uber eats. 

I didn’t want to take it further because we hadn’t heard or seen him in months, so we just left it alone and went about our life. 

But then, about a month ago, I was going through my message requests on Facebook, and I saw that someone called Bill had been messaging me (or trying to) for months. I went into the messages and clicked his profile and lo and behold it was Creepy Bill. 

I blocked him immediately and that was when I decided I’d report him on Uber eats. So I filed a complaint about him and I haven’t heard anything since. But yeah. I’ve no idea how he found me on Facebook or how he knew my surname but he did, and tried to message me for months. 

So there’s the update! Creepy stuff. 😳.

I (28F) work in a design agency  fast-paced, slightly chaotic, lots of iced coffee and passive-aggressive Slack messages. We were in the middle of a tight deadline, so everyone was staying late and eating lunch at their desks. Naturally, I offered to coordinate a group lunch order. I like food. I like lists. It felt like my time to shine.

So I start taking everyone’s orders. One of my coworkers  let’s call her Tara,  asks for *“the usual chicken bowl from that place with the green logo.”* I nod, no questions asked. I’d ordered for her before and thought I knew what she meant. Spoiler: I absolutely did not.

Turns out, there are two places with green logos on the app, both with chicken bowls. I picked the wrong one.

Lunch arrives. Everyone’s eating. Tara opens her bowl, stares at it, and then just… freezes. Like, mid-breath. Then she *gets up* and walks out. No explanation. No “ugh, wrong order,” just grabs her phone and leaves.

Fifteen minutes later, she comes back. Silent. Pale. Holding a tiny velvet box.

Here’s where it gets weird.

Apparently, her fiancé had been acting shady lately, and she suspected something was off. That day, she noticed the bowl came with a very specific sauce, the one *she hates*, but her fiancé *loves*. She recognized the combo instantly because she used to order *that exact bowl* when they first started dating.

Turns out, he’d been ordering from *that* place on his own. A lot. For *two* people.

Tara, being an FBI-level detective in yoga pants, used the receipt in the bag (and the weird hunch triggered by *my* mix-up) to log into their shared delivery account. And boom. Dozens of duplicate orders. Sent to a random address downtown.

Long story short, she drove there. Found him having lunch with someone else. Someone who had very good taste in chicken bowls.

She broke off the engagement *on the spot*. Threw the ring at him. (She later admitted it was more of a gentle underhand toss, but still.)

Now she’s single, thriving, and in therapy.

And me? I’m no longer allowed to coordinate group meals. I’ve been *banned* from anything that involves someone else's lunch. My coworkers now call me “The Accidental Homewrecker.” Someone even made a Slack emoji of the bowl.

Anyway. That’s how I learned a chicken order can end a relationship. Life’s weird.",7,1753329494.0,story,3,1.0,False

I started wondering if it was burnout or just life post - 30, but something didn’t feel right.

Eventually I went to a functional medicine NP, and while nothing was “clinically wrong,” she showed me I had low-normal thyroid markers and borderline vitamin deficiencies. She didn’t push meds but instead suggested some daily changes.

Here’s what REALLY helped me over the next 90 days:

1m7u9t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m7u9t4/very_long_lost_my_best_friend_havent_lived_with/,"[VERY LONG] - Lost My Best Friend, Haven't Lived With Anyone Who Will Talk To Me For A Few Years, Feeling More Alone Than Ever (could use some kindness but just wanted to put it out there to feel it)","I've tried to sit down and write this several dozen times it feels like. I've been alone for almost 3 years and have had to move at least once, sometimes twice, a year for 10 years now.

My best friend (C), her fiancé (W), and I lived together for 7 of those years, moving every single year. It was fine because I had them and they were great people, but during the 7th year they broke up and my best friend moved out without even talking to me about it. I got a text asking to take care of him. I did, of course. I loved both of them.

She came back a couple weeks later crying as she hugged and apologized to me. It was so much anxiety off of my back. I was so relieved that she wasn't just gone. We talked it out and hung out many times over the next couple of months until W and I moved into a smaller place that was another 30 minutes away from C, who had moved to the city about an hour away.

It made seeing her hard, and I didn't have a car at the time because I worked from home and lived in an area with amazing public transit (rare, I know) I had a card for work even though I worked from home, so I rode for free always, so it made sense.

Anyway, C and I saw less and less of each other. I offered to come to her via bus, even though it was a 5-hour trip (though I didn't tell her that) or I'd offer to give her gas money for picking me up for a weekend. But that meant 3 hours on either end of the weekend. It was hard.

She was having issues with her antidepressants not working and was constantly getting new ones until she ran out. As a result of the constant side effects of her medications changing constantly, weeks or months without it, or when she started clinical trials for ketamine, things got really stressful.

I suffer from depression but not nearly on the same level as C, but I have terrible separation anxiety as well. Months of calling off plans last minute, getting mad at me about things then ruminating on them silently, and eventually yelling about something that we'd normally have laughed off in person, or played back and forth with over-the-top insults and whatnot, eventually wore me down.

I started getting angry back. Saying awful things, ignoring her, also ruminating on things. I started firing back more than she did to me and more consistently. I got lost in it.

We still tried to mend things and there were plenty of ""I love you"" moments between us and reminding each other it was just hard and we missed each other. I couldn't tell you who did it more often, but I meant it, and I believed she did too.

9 or 10 months of this, and we finally sat down in the same room. I hashed out all of my reasons and why I had been so upset and I apologized for very specific things and just for hurting her in general. I can't blame my anxiety alone, and I wouldn't try to excuse myself, so I apologize if it sounds like that.

She did the same and explained the trials and having her mom come stay with her because of suicidal thoughts. This is legitimately something she had happen alongside panic attacks and her seizures lately, and I had seen both plenty when we lived together.

We hugged in silence for a long time just crying. I felt so much weight off and we had made plans for her to come visit me since her and her family would be vacationing in Florida, near where I was going to live, and she wanted me to come with them. Her family knew that and she would often invite me to big life events. As a matter of fact, she always insisted I come, and they agreed. I was happy for a few days.

She died just 3 days later. Something about the ketamine and her seizure medication that I never got a clear answer on.

I was devastated. I didn't leave my room basically at all for the next week until I realized my cat needed food.

My roommate W, at this point, was not talking to me for several reasons. I had taken care of him and reintroduced him to new friends about 6 months prior and after I lost my job, I had been unemployed for 6 months and not having a car was becoming a problem, he stopped talking to me. He admitted to resenting me because I was a freeloader and decided he'd go out all the time and start sleeping around, until he met his current girlfriend who they would then ask me not to come out of my room while they were hanging out in the living room.

I told them that was fucking stupid and a terrible thing to ask, but there we were when they'd stare me down for walking out of the house or just into the kitchen to get water.

Anyway, with C dead and W not speaking to me, I was alone. More than I had ever been in my life. The constant moving and no car meant my friends were always an hour out and while a few visited me immediately to help, it didn't last more than 2 weeks.

I spent the rest of my lease alone in my room, unable to talk to the one person who might understand, but he was too bitter about their breakup and angry at me to care. He went on like nothing had changed.

I moved to Florida with my mother. It was supposed to be a short ""get back on my feet"" period, which turned into a year because I made plans to live with another friend in Ohio pretty early on, but it would be a year out, and that would give me time to get a car and save money.

I thought things would be better, but my grandmother who lives there too has dementia and I helped take care of her (which isn't a problem, but it was hard sometimes). My older brother was there and he is a bitter man with polarizing beliefs for lack of a better way to say it here who would yell at the top of his lungs whenever he could if anyone disagreed with him.

My depressed mother was just unable to stop to catch herself because of my grandmother and my older brother, who openly hates on her for ruining his marriage. She didn't, but he wants to blame someone that isn't himself or his ex-wife.

Whenever I'd talk to my grandmother, she'd forget I was speaking and walk off, or ask what I was talking about halfway through responding to her. It would often be as quick as 2 or 3 sentences, but she'd glaze over or forget.

My older brother couldn't hold a conversation without moving it to those polarizing things I mentioned like how our gay brother and his husband are dramatic and that violent crimes against ""his kind"" are overblown because they're such a low statistic compared to everyone else who gets murdered. MISSING THE POINT ENTIRELY.

I am bitter about him turning out the way he is, I'm sorry. But because of those things I couldn't talk to him peacefully or without him trying to gaslight me / convert me into hating our mother or convincing me our brother was a piece of shit.

My mother tried, but she was so depressed over her mom getting worse and my older brother disrespecting and badmouthing her to anyone who would listen that she didn't have it in her to talk to me without losing focus or having nothing to say.

I was alone again, and for a year this time. Closest I'd been with family in about a decade and I couldn't enjoy any time with them.

I moved to Ohio earlier this year. It was supposed to be a 14-hour drive over 2 days and then a day of recovery followed by going to a wedding as my friend's +1.

Her (K) and I had been friends for almost 15 years, and we even went on a few dates 2 years in, but we both agreed it wasn't gonna work and we didn't have it in us at the time and chose to remain friends.

We had been talking every day, almost all day over text, for about the whole year I was in Florida. I mean 6am to 12am almost EVERY DAY. It felt like we had become very close. We were joking around a lot in the same ways me and C did. I felt that hole being closed a little bit. It never will close fully.

I truly believe C was my platonic soul mate. I've never had a friend like her and don't believe I ever will, but this felt like something that was missing had come back and it was immensely comforting after so much time. K and I made many plans to binge shows, go on trips, and to introduce to some of the friends I met when she invited me to her group chat after it seemed like I got along really well with them.

The time of the move came and my boss asked me to give up one of the days because he mismanaged the PTO but said it was fine if not. I said it was fine and I'd leave a day late. Still had time to get there with some rest.

But then K told me she had gotten the date wrong and that it was the next day after I left at like 9am. I should have said I couldn't make the wedding, but I wanted to keep my word to her and I proceeded to drive it all in one day.

Though I didn't drive 14 hours. I drove 19. I left at 8:30AM and got there at 3:30AM. I got stuck in Atlanta for several hours, but I made it in one drive. I stopped 6 times for about 15 minutes at a time just because I needed to.

I didn’t go to the wedding and I nearly slept for 12 hours.

K and I talked about hanging out on Monday after she was done with the wedding and family stuff, and that was fine by me.

Monday comes and she says she has plans. I thought, okay, I'm new here and she probably got swept up in the excitement of me being there and forgot she had plans. That was fine to me. I just got there and was a new addition, so it made sense that she probably forgot.

She suggested Thursday or Friday, and I said Thursday because I had plans Friday. Cool, we had the game plan.

Wednesday comes by, I hadn’t seen her basically at all because of her job, by the way, and I suggest seeing a movie the next day because Thunderbolts was apparently pretty good for a Marvel movie.

She said, “My Sunday should be free,” and I asked, “What about Thursday? We had plans?” and she said, “Yeah, my Sunday is probably good” again.

I made a passive-aggressive joke saying, “Oof, I didn’t think I’d have to wait all week to hang out with you haha” and started walking toward my room a bit.

She looked at me with the most disgusted look I have ever seen someone use on me in my life. Not that it’s happened, but it was completely jarring. She just says, “I thought you just needed a roommate,” and walks off.

I was stunned. I had no idea what that meant.

Saturday rolls by, and we had talked a bit here and there, had a few good laughs, so I thought my anxiety had just spiked for a moment and it was cool.

I asked if we were still on for the next day during the evening and she texts me, “Do you even want to hang out?” as part of her message, which really confused me.

The rest of the text fucked with my head because what she was referring to was a joke regarding some fuzzy cuffs she pulled out of a dresser while cleaning. I had made some comment about “playing dress up” that was just in the moment and we laughed about it.

We had both said much “worse” things to each other over the last year. Nothing ever aggressive or inappropriate, just basic “oho someone likes to play” kind of stuff. This wasn’t even graphic, just a comment about playing dress-up to the extreme. Stupid and probably not funny, but we shared a laugh because it was stupid.

Anyway, she says in this text, “I gotta be honest I did not appreciate the comments when I was getting the rest of my stuff out of my drawers.”

I, not remembering, text back “comments?” because nothing registered in my head regarding it. It was such a throwaway line. I decided I didn’t want to go over it in text and immediately walked upstairs after and asked her what was up. She told me about it.

I apologized. I said:

“I apologize. That was definitely not my intent. We had both made tons of jokes like that and we both laughed about that specifically. I had no idea you had been holding onto that for a couple of days.”

I said more about how we had made worse jokes in DMs over the last year so it didn’t feel out there, but regardless of what I think, I apologized. It wasn’t my intention to hurt her feelings.

She said thank you, but then also, and this crushed me, “You make me feel uncomfortable and you came on too strongly.”

I’ve never been told my friendliness makes anyone uncomfortable before. Not to mention, I basically hadn’t seen her. I bought coffee for both of us twice, but that was because she recommended some places and I thought I’d repay her for the suggestions and it’d be nice as a new roommate.

But besides those moments and following up on when she wanted to hang out, I didn’t see her except for less than 5 minutes a day where I generally just would say hi and ask how her day was.

To be told I make her uncomfortable and that I came on too strongly... OBLITERATED me. I asked how and what I was doing that made her feel that way and she said ""I don't know"" and I suggested just shelving it for now and talking about it in the morning so she had time to process if need be. She said ok. The next day she brushed off my attempts to ask about it saying she had a long day. I never got an apology.

I’m still upset about it 3 months later as I’m getting ready to move out. We didn’t hang out that Sunday. I decided I wanted to take a day or so to myself and meet other people.

From that point on though, she actively walked away if I said hello and would never engage me if I asked how she was doing. She’d never return that politeness or listen when I told her about some weird thing I found exploring the city.

She would either walk away or start looking at her phone partway through and I’d have to ask after a few seconds if she was there, and she’d go “yeah sorry” then go back to her phone after I repeated myself. This would be one or two times and then I’d walk away, and she’d say sorry but never ask further.

I dropped a 20lb weight on my foot at the gym and had a severe limp. I asked her to help out if I needed to go to the doctor and to get some ice packs. She didn’t even ask if I was okay and just kept looking at her phone and didn't answer.

In the 3 months I’ve been here, she has never come to me to talk about anything, chat when we see each other, or even invited me to hang out. I would sometimes pop by her room when she was just scrolling her phone to say what’s up when her door was open. I did that several times over a couple of months and her door has remained closed since.

I’ve felt more alone than ever because now I’m a stranger living with someone who seemingly resents me and won’t look at me. I live in my room alone and roam an empty house on occasion. I’ve met some people in the city, but no one I’d call a new friend really. I’ve been too depressed, and I’ve slipped back into the same feeling as when C died.

I’ve been miserable and alone here, and I drove 19 hours to have this be my life. I’m moving 10 hours away in about a week, but I just feel like crying and I can’t for some reason.

I’m so hurt from this on top of the last 2 years. I just don’t know how to function and I know I shouldn’t be airing all of this, but I’m at my wits’ end and I feel completely alienated by K now and I don’t think the friendship is going to last after this.

But I honestly can’t tell what I did wrong.

Without C, I don’t have anyone close enough who has the emotional maturity to say more than “that sucks” and that’s not a dig on them because I love my other friends, but it’s not helpful and I don’t have anyone while I stew in the basement with my cat.

I feel broken and I can’t cry and it just sucks so badly. I don’t even have the words to describe how the last 2 1/2 years have been.

I don’t even know if this all makes sense or will read well. I just wrote it and needed to get it out there. I know it's very long and I appreciate anyone who read it.",2,1753329401.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1m7u7oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1m7u7oa/concentrate_for_traveling_making_it_stronger/,Concentrate for traveling. Making it stronger?,"I've got a question about making cold brew concentrate for traveling.  I searched the sub for ""concentrate"", and read years-old posts about concentrate ratios and such, but wanted to see what current trends / ideas might be with newer answers.   
  
I'm not a professional at this, by any means, and definitely not as serious as most of the people on this sub seem to be.  I make cold brew to use for iced coffee or frappuccinos at home, mostly to add the coffee flavor, and I don't care about the caffeine content, or intricacies in the flavor from drinking it black, because i like a ton of cream and sugar in mine.     
    
My normal method is usually done in a half gallon jug, and would probably be somewhere around maybe a 1:8 or 1:10 ratio, by volume, using the pre-ground bagged coffee from the grocery store designed for regular coffee makers (medium grind, I guess?)  I brew for about 24 hours at room temp, then strain and keep it in the fridge.  I usually mix it at about a 1:1 ratio with milk, then pour over or blend it with ice.  I might add a bit more of the cold brew if I want more coffee flavor, but I guess that I'm probably making ""coffee milk"" more than I'm making ""iced coffee.""    
  
Ok, so here's my question: I'm planning for a trip, and want to make a more concentrated cold brew so that I can take less volume of the concentrate with me, and still be able to dilute it for iced coffee and such, like I normally do, but more concentrated than my normal 1:1 ratio.   Instead of a cup of coffee, and a cup of milk, I would love to be able to get it down to something like an ounce of coffee and 8 ounces of milk.    
    
Is there an ideal or preferred ratio to use (weight or volume) to make the most concentrated version, flavor-wise, that I could dilute for my iced coffee (coffee milk)?  Would the size of the grind make a big difference in concentrating the flavor?  I know that most people seem to recommend large grind, but I don't have any problems with my normal method of using the medium grind.  Caffeine level isn't a concern, as I may use decaf coffee, or possibly mix regular and decaf.  Is the type of coffee that i use going to make much of a difference?  Like, would i want a light roast vs a darker roast to give me more flavor (without it being overly bitter, or anything)?  Would it make a difference if I used an unflavored vs a flavored coffee?  And what about using something like Cafe Bustelo, or some kind of espresso coffee vs the regular Maxwell House or Foldgers coffee for the normal coffee makers?  I'm just looking to get the most concentrated coffee flavor that I can so that I can take less volume of the concentrate with me, and dilute when it's time to drink it.  
  
So, can y'all please share your wisdom with me of the best way to make the most concentrated cold brew flavor that I can?

1m7u6pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1m7u6pm/reconciliation_communication_spell_and_sweetening/,Reconciliation + Communication Spell and Sweetening Jar,"So this morning I did my first Reconciliation + Communication Spell and a Sweetening jar.

Reconciliation + Communication:

White candle and Yellow candle (Communication) Small jar Orange Peel Rose Bud Instant Coffee Lavender salt Red Chili flakes Nutmeg Taglocks Personalized Petition Crystals you feel drawn too Fire proof bowl Lighter Incense

First I cleansed with a vanilla incense and grounded myself, because this is a reconciliation between an SP and I—For grounding myself I played a spell playlist I made and sat quietly singing along to the songs for meditation.

Once grounded I carved my name and his name + d.o.b. On the white candle along with the phrases “All is forgiven” and “Open road to love”. On the yellow candle I carved my sigil for open communication. I then anointed both of those candles with a protection oil I made as well as nutmeg.

In the jar, I did my tag lock and his (I had his name and sweet sentiments cut out from letters I’ve gotten from him in his handwriting), Lavender, rosebuds, orange peels, salt, instant coffee(because I want this to work rather quickly), red chili flakes( for a spicy sex life between us), along with a personal petition written in red ink (His tag lock folded in the petition towards me as many times as I could fold)

While that sat to the side, I set up the candles side by side in a fire proof bowl, and the crystals I felt drawn to: Rose Quartz, amethyst, and a regular quartz. While lighting the candles I recited

""Any and all things preventing a reconciliation between X and X are cleared from our path. All is forgiven between X and X. The road to love between X and X is open."" (I got from another spell while researching and I liked it, so I incorporated it) When done reciting, I used some of the wax from the candles to seal my jar.

Sweetening Jar:

Sugar Instant Coffee Rose bud Nutmeg White Willow Dragons Blood Resin Sweet Oil Tag Lock Personalized Petition Red candle Small Vile Incense

I started by cleansing the vile jar with a rose incense, again grounding myself to a playlist of some of the songs we’ve listened to before.

In the jar I started with Sugar, instant coffee, Rose buds, nutmeg, white willow, petition with his tag lock folded three times towards me, my tag lock, and sweet oil to top off everything. I then carved sigil for sweet thoughts on the candle and anointed with sweet oil and nutmeg.

I closed the jar, and sat listening to the music while thinking of some of the times he was the sweetest to me while holding the jar. Once I was done, I closed it and place the red candle on top lighting it and letting burn until it was done.

I said my goodbyes and thank you and grounded with meditation and a quick tarot pull.

From this, I have had a major confidence boost and this tingly feeling on the spots he’s kissed on my neck before. It’s like they’re radiating 😂

For the tarot pull, I thought the cards were interesting and really confirmed that it pulled on those energy cords between us. We’ve been no contact for about 3 weeks now and I just have this great feeling about these spells. Later this week I plan on doing another layer and trying my hand at a lust spell/obsession spell(I don’t want to hear about the consequences, I’m positive this is what I want and it’s part of my bigger plan.)

The cards that jumped before I could even formed my question was Reversed Queen of cups, The Devil, Ace of Cups, and the Empress. The King of Cups also jumped in reverse.

1m7u4gb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7u4gb,The 40 Prompting Rules That Separate Amateurs From Professionals,"I've spent hundreds of hours testing prompts across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. This isn't theory—it's what actually works.

Most people treat AI like a magic 8-ball. They ask vague questions and get garbage outputs. The secret is that **AI rewards structure, clarity, and context.** Master these, and the tool becomes 10x more powerful.

Save this post. It's the cheat sheet you'll wish you had sooner.

# The 20 DOs: How to Get What You Want

I've grouped these into four key principles: **Be the Director, Provide the Script, Set the Stage, and Demand a Great Performance.**

# Principle 1: Be the Director (Give Clear Orders)

1. **Assign a Role:** This is the most powerful trick. Force the AI into a persona.
   * **Before:** `Explain the stock market.`
   * **After:** `You are an investment advisor explaining the stock market to a complete beginner. Use simple analogies.`
2. **State Your Request Explicitly:** Don't hint. Tell it exactly what you want.
3. **Lead with Instructions:** Put your core command at the very beginning of the prompt.
4. **Specify Your Target Audience:** Who is this for? The AI needs to know.
5. **Define the Tone of Voice:** Should it be formal, witty, empathetic, or enthusiastic?
6. **Indicate the Desired Length:** Ask for a paragraph, 200 words, or three key bullet points.

# Principle 2: Provide the Script (Give Great Material)

1. **Provide Examples:** Show, don't just tell. This is how you clone a style.
   * **Before:** `Write a tweet about our new productivity app.`
   * **After:** `Write 3 tweets about our new productivity app, ""ZenFlow."" Here's an example of the style I want: ""Tired of juggling 10 tabs just to manage your day? 😫 Our new app simplifies it all. Welcome to the future of focus. #Productivity""`
2. **Use Delimiters:** Use `""""""`, `###`, or `---` to clearly separate your instructions from the content you want it to analyze.
3. **Explain Your Purpose:** Tell the AI *why* you need this. It helps align the output with your goal.
4. **Share Relevant Background:** Give it the context it needs to produce an informed response.
5. **Specify Industry/Niche Context:** ""Marketing"" is too broad. ""Marketing for a local, high-end coffee shop"" is much better.

# Principle 3: Set the Stage (Control the Format)

1. **Specify the Output Format:** Don't leave it to chance.
   * **Before:** `Give me some blog post ideas.`
   * **After:** `Generate 5 blog post ideas about sustainable urban gardening. Return the output as a JSON array of objects, where each object has a ""title"" and a ""hook"" key.`
2. **Break Complex Tasks into Steps:** Ask it to do one thing at a time. ""Think step-by-step.""
3. **Use Section Headers:** For longer content, tell the AI to structure its response with headers like ""Introduction,"" ""Key Benefits,"" and ""Conclusion.""

# Principle 4: Demand a Great Performance (Refine & Verify)

1. **Request Multiple Perspectives:** Ask for the ""bull case vs. the bear case"" or the ""optimist's view vs. the pessimist's view.""
2. **Ask for Pros and Cons:** Get a balanced perspective on any topic.
3. **Request Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Make the AI show its work. This is great for catching errors.
4. **Request Quoted Sources:** Ask for direct quotes or citations to ground the response in facts.
5. **Define Your Success Criteria:** Tell it what a ""good"" answer looks like to you.
6. **Set Ethical Boundaries:** Explicitly state what it should *not* do (e.g., ""Do not use sensationalist language or make unsubstantiated health claims."").

# The 20 DON'Ts: How to Avoid Garbage Outputs

# Category 1: Vague & Ambiguous Inputs

1. **Don't Use Single-Word Prompts:** `Prompt: ""Marketing""` will give you a useless, generic essay.
2. **Don't Use Unclear Pronouns:** Avoid ""it,"" ""they,"" and ""that"" when the reference isn't crystal clear.
3. **Don't Over-Generalize:** Be specific. Not ""cars,"" but ""the impact of electric vehicles on the US auto industry from 2020-2025.""
4. **Don't Ask for ""The Best"" Without Criteria:** ""Best"" is subjective. Define what ""best"" means (e.g., ""cheapest,"" ""most durable,"" ""easiest for a beginner"").
5. **Don't Use Unnecessary Jargon or Slang:** It can confuse the AI or lead to awkward-sounding results.

# Category 2: Poorly Structured Prompts

1. **Don't Cram Multiple Questions into One Sentence:**
   * **Bad:** `Tell me about the history of Python, why it's so popular for data science, and what the main differences are between Python 2 and 3.`
   * **Good:** Ask each question as a separate, clear instruction.
2. **Don't Write Excessively Long, Rambling Prompts:** Be concise. More words don't mean better results.
3. **Don't Include Irrelevant Details:** Stay focused on the core task.
4. **Don't Combine Unrelated Requests:** Don't ask for a poem about dogs and a market analysis of the tech sector in the same prompt.
5. **Don't Use Inconsistent Terminology:** Stick to the same terms for the same concepts throughout your prompt.
6. **Don't Mix Conflicting Objectives:** ""Write a formal, professional report that is also hilarious and full of puns.""

# Category 3: Unrealistic & Unsafe Practices

1. **NEVER Share Personal Identifiers:** No SSN, home address, etc. Treat it like a public forum.
2. **Don't Share Sensitive Credentials:** No passwords, API keys, or financial info.
3. **Don't Request Content That Violates Terms of Service:** This includes illegal, hateful, or dangerous material.
4. **Don't Expect Perfect Accuracy:** AI hallucinates. It makes things up.
5. **Don't Accept Facts Without Verification:** **ALWAYS** double-check important information.
6. **Don't Assume Comprehensive Expertise:** Its knowledge can be shallow or outdated.
7. **Don't Set Unrealistic Expectations:** It can't predict the future or read your mind.
8. **Don't Ignore Context Limitations:** Models have a limit on how much text they can process at once. Don't paste a 300-page book and expect a perfect summary.
9. **Don't Forget You're in Control:** If you don't like the output, tweak the prompt. Iterate. You're the one in charge.

Prompting is a skill. The difference between amateur and professional AI use comes down to how you structure your inputs.

Bad prompts create AI word salad. Good prompts create business leverage.

The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and sunscreen, and the distant hum of the ocean provided a soothing soundtrack to the resort's daily rhythm. Valeria Cruz, a trans woman with a warm smile and a sharp wit, was the resort's manager. She moved with an assured grace, her laugh echoing through the lobby as she greeted guests. Her eyes, a deep shade of brown, held a spark that hinted at her unapologetic nature, a trait that was both her strength and her charm.

Across the lobby, Celeste Pablo, a woman with a soft demeanor and a subtle blush that never seemed to fade, was checking in a new guest. Her fingers danced over the keyboard, her eyes darting between the screen and the guest's ID. She was a picture of efficiency, but there was a hint of something more, a secret longing that flickered in her eyes when she thought no one was looking. 

Valeria noticed the exchange, her gaze lingering on Celeste a moment longer than necessary. There was something about the young woman that piqued her interest, a sweet vulnerability that she found both intriguing and appealing. The stage was set, and the first notes of a potential romance were playing out in the lobby of the Beachside Resort.

In the days that followed, the Beachside Resort became a stage for the subtle dance of attraction between Valeria and Celeste. As they navigated the resort's daily routines, they found themselves drawn to each other with an almost magnetic force. 

Valeria, with her confident stride and warm smile, would often catch Celeste's eye from across the lobby, their gazes locking for a moment before she would look away, her cheeks flushing a soft pink. One morning, as Valeria passed by the coffee station, her hand brushed against Celeste's as she reached for a cup. 

They both paused, their eyes meeting, and for a moment, the world around them seemed to still. ""Sorry,"" Valeria said, her voice a soft rumble, ""I didn't mean to startle you."" Celeste, her eyes wide and her lips slightly parted, simply shook her head, a soft smile playing on her lips. ""It's okay,"" she managed to say, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It's just... you're always so... present."" Valeria chuckled, her eyes never leaving Celeste's. ""Present, huh? I like that."" 

She took a sip of her coffee, her eyes lingering on Celeste's face, a small smile playing on her lips. ""You know, I've been thinking,"" she said, her voice low and intimate, ""maybe we should have a meeting about... our coffee preferences."" Celeste's blush deepened, her eyes sparkling with a mix of surprise and amusement. ""I think that's a brilliant idea,"" she replied, her voice a soft purr. ""But maybe we should do it somewhere a little more... private."" Valeria's smile widened, her eyes holding a promise of more to come. ""I think that can be arranged,"" she said, her voice a low rumble. ""After all, we can't have our guests thinking we're neglecting our duties, can we?""

Valeria's smile deepened, her eyes holding a promise of more to come. ""I think that can be arranged,"" she said, her voice a low rumble. ""After all, we can't have our guests thinking we're neglecting our duties, can we?"" She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""What do you say we meet in my office after closing? I promise, it's much more... comfortable for a 'meeting'."" Celeste's blush deepened, her eyes sparkling with a mix of surprise and amusement. 

""That sounds... very inviting,"" she replied, her voice a soft purr. ""But I should warn you, I'm not very good at keeping secrets."" Valeria chuckled, her eyes never leaving Celeste's. ""Neither am I, my dear. But sometimes, secrets are best kept between the two of us."" She took a sip of her coffee, her eyes lingering on Celeste's face, a small smile playing on her lips. ""So, are you in?"" she asked, her voice a low rumble. 

Celeste hesitated for a moment, her eyes flickering with a mix of apprehension and excitement. Then, she took a deep breath and nodded, a soft smile playing on her lips. ""Yes,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I'm in.""

# Best Dessert Spoon 2025: Top Sets Reviewed

Dessert spoons, often overlooked in the grand scheme of cutlery, play a vital role in our enjoyment of sweet treats. They are specifically designed to enhance the eating experience of puddings, ice cream, cakes, and other delectable desserts. Choosing the right dessert spoon set can elevate your dining experience, adding a touch of elegance and practicality to every bite.

## Key Features Analysis

The best dessert spoon sets for 2025 offer a blend of aesthetics, durability, and functionality.

**Material:** High-quality stainless steel is the standard for modern dessert spoons, offering resistance to rust, tarnish, and corrosion. 18/10 stainless steel, comprising 18% chromium and 10% nickel, signifies premium quality, providing exceptional durability and a lustrous finish. The higher nickel content contributes to a brighter shine and enhanced corrosion resistance, ensuring the spoons maintain their appearance over time.

**Design and Ergonomics:** The design should be both visually appealing and pleasant to hold. Look for spoons with balanced weight, smooth edges and ergonomic handles. Handle designs vary widely, from sleek and minimalist to ornate and customary. Consider the shape of the spoon bowl itself; some are oval, while others are more rounded or pointed, each influencing the way the dessert is gathered and presented.

**Finish:** the finish of the dessert spoon contributes substantially to its overall aesthetics and perceived quality. Polished finishes offer a reflective shine, while matte finishes provide a more subtle and contemporary look. Some spoons feature specialized coatings,such as titanium finishes,for increased durability and scratch resistance. The quality of the finish directly affects the spoon's resistance to fingerprints and water spots,influencing its ease of maintenance.

**Weight and Balance:** The weight of a dessert spoon influences its perceived quality and how it feels in hand. A well-balanced spoon feels comfortable and stable during use,without feeling too heavy or too light. Optimal weight distributes evenly across the spoon,allowing for effortless scooping and serving. The balance point should ideally be located near the center of the handle, ensuring the spoon remains steady and controlled.

**Set Size and Presentation:** Dessert spoon sets typically range from four to twelve pieces, catering to different household sizes and entertainment needs. Consider the number of spoons required for regular use and potential gatherings. presentation matters, particularly if the set is intended as a gift. Look for sets that come in attractive packaging or with dedicated storage boxes.

## Core Benefits

Their resistance to rust, tarnish, and corrosion ensures they remain functional and attractive for years to come. Investing in durable dessert spoons is a cost-effective choice, as they eliminate the need for frequent replacements.

After each use, wash the spoons with warm, soapy water and dry them thoroughly with a soft cloth.Avoid leaving them soaking in water for extended periods and avoid using abrasive cleaners, as thes can scratch the surface. Regular polishing with a stainless-steel cleaner can help maintain their luster.**Are dessert spoons dishwasher safe?**
Most high-quality stainless steel dessert spoons are dishwasher safe. Though, it's advisable to check the manufacturer's instructions before placing them in the dishwasher.To prevent water spots, remove the spoons as soon as the wash cycle is complete and dry them by hand.**What is the difference between a dessert spoon and a soup spoon?**

Walked over 20,000 steps daily in that heat. So I had to be sharp with nutrition, just enough to fuel the grind, not enough to lose the edge. I wanted to stay lean, stay locked in.

At the end of shift, I’d brush my teeth with warm water from a sun-baked plastic bottles that have been sitting out for weeks, but it saved me the hassle of walking back and forth just to use the sinks. Bought me a few extra minutes of rest. Out there, even that was a win.

I assure you guys on the mod team, on scout's honor, though I have never been one, that this is Davis related, and I am a concerned resident of this ***great?*** town?  Anyway ...

I posted a few posts here and there warning about something wrong with our town's water but it went largely ignored as I suspected it would (but that's not important now).  

If you guys have been following earthquake news or read my PSA warning about a big earthquake hitting the CA coast, then you would know we might be expecting a lot of ***rescuing*** in the next few days and even a lot of guests visiting this town, DAVIS  --- see it is totally relevant to Davis, so mods please do not delete this post.

I have noted that there is something wrong with our tap water for a while.   I have identified two compunds of concern both of which could be removed by those water filtering machines you find in the grocery stores.

 Unfortunately none of them are working at this point and I suspect it is because they have not been serviced for a while.  I have my theory as to why but I don't want to be called a conspiracy theorist in this time of crisis.  

The first chemical is an alcohol.  My guess is methanol.  It can be easily removed by boiling your water for say 20 minutes or so or put your water in a closed lid water container (like the ones you find at Co-op or Westlake market) under the sun for a few hours, try to open the lid hallf way through to let the air out and close it again.  

The second chemical seem like it cannot be boiled off easily but it can be destroyed by sun light but some of it will condense with water-methanol onto the underside of the lid (thus hidden from the sun) if you used the sun cleaning method above.  Do not touch it because it is fat soluble and can stick to your skin and go into your system.  Instead you clean it with milk, just submerge it in milk for a few minutes.  If it got stuck onto your fingers, try to do the same as quickly as possible.  If you don't have milk just wipe it off and clean the lid with milk when you get a chance.  

Now if you do not have a closed water container around you can try to find rice or beans around the house, crush them and boil them with the water and dump them out afterward with a coffee filter, I don't think you need a lot since the containment is not at a high enough concentration to kill you immediately, and we have been drinking these for a long time.  Yes, I have noticed it for a long time but I just never realized I should look into it until recently because ... well ... I ... thought someone ... in the city is ***paid*** to do this.  Obviously, for people with sobriety issues, please do not drink Davis water without boiling.  

When I was a kid living in the Bay Area, every year there would be a pair of young college students (like the Mormon missionaries) coming by my mom's house asking for water samples to test the quality of water for their ***summer research projects***.   It seems like we don't do that here despite living right next to a ***world-reknown*** university.  Oh, wait, a ***world-reknown-publically-fundeed-land-grant*** university -- what a mouthful.  

Anyway, the big earthquake is coming and soon.  I expect we will have a lot of guests.  Please reserve bottle waters for people in the crisis zone while we should just drink our self-cleaned-tap-water.  I know it is a hassle.  Also please reserve watermellon, milk, apples, basically perishables for babies, kids under 10, and expecting mothers.  I suspect these chemicals are targetted at these groups of people.   

Worst case just drink the tap, it won't kill you.  My family try to avoid it but we have been ***forced*** to drink it on and off for the ***say*** past month or so because ... Well that's another ***legend*** for another time.  

Stay safe and be nice to our guest.  Remember, knowledge is power, but it is an ***evil*** power unless you ***share*** it.  So don't be a ***richard***, share your knowledge.

We agreed to get coffee and lunch, but since I'm not overly familiar with the area, I wanted to see about asking locals about some lunch spot recommendations.

I'm looking for something more like a ""light lunch"" place, as I don't want to go overly fancy and expensive or really cheap and like I'm not putting in any effort. And before anyone says anything, if they're worth being friends with they wont give me grief over a lunch place, but this will be our first official time meeting in person and I want to make a good impression.

They say there's a new coffee place in/around the mall they want to try, so I'm looking for restaurants near there. Plus, a list of places to try would be great for the future anyways, lol. Thanks for the help!",2,1753328398.0,asheville,7,1.0,False

That should worry me more than it does. What worries me instead is that I can't remember the last time I *was* tired. When I try to recall the feeling of exhaustion, of heavy eyelids and the relief of sinking into bed, I come up empty. It's like trying to remember a color that doesn't exist.

The insomnia started after I found the receipt.

I was cleaning out my junk drawer, you know, that kitchen drawer everyone has where batteries go to die and takeout menus multiply, when I found a crumpled piece of paper wedged behind the manual for a coffee maker I'd thrown away years ago.

It was a receipt from Somnus Sleep Center, dated three weeks ago. Services rendered: ""Memory extraction procedure - REM cycle integration."" Total cost: $2,847.

I'd never heard of Somnus Sleep Center. I'd never had any kind of sleep procedure. And I definitely didn't have $2,847 to spend on mysterious medical treatments.

But the receipt had *my name on it. My address. My phone number.*

I called the number printed at the bottom. A pleasant woman answered: ""Somnus Sleep Center, this is Miranda, how can I help you?""

""I found a receipt for a procedure I don't remember having,"" I said. ""Can you look up my account?""

""Of course! Name and date of birth?""

I gave her my information. I heard typing.

""Oh yes, Mr. Patterson. You came in three weeks ago for our premium memory extraction package. Dr. Vance performed the procedure personally. How are you feeling?""

""I don't remember being there.""

""That's perfectly normal,"" Miranda said cheerfully. ""*The whole point is that you wouldn't remember. That's what you paid for.*""

""What exactly did I pay for?""

""Memory extraction during REM sleep. You came to us because you were having trouble with recurring nightmares and intrusive memories. Dr. Vance removed the problematic memories while you slept. Very cutting-edge stuff.""

I hung up.

Here's the thing about memory: you don't notice what's missing until you go looking for it. It's like realizing you haven't seen your neighbor's cat in a while, was it there yesterday? Last week? When did you last definitely see it?

I started making lists, trying to catalog what I could and couldn't remember. Childhood: mostly there, though some birthdays were fuzzy. High school: present but vague. College: clear enough. My job, my apartment, my daily routines: all intact.

But when I tried to remember why I might have needed memory extraction, I hit a wall. *What nightmares? What intrusive memories?* What had been so bad that I'd paid nearly three thousand dollars to have it surgically removed from my brain?

I drove to the address on the receipt.

Somnus Sleep Center occupied the third floor of a nondescript medical building downtown. The waiting room looked like every other medical office: beige walls, magazines from 2019, the smell of industrial carpet cleaner. But something felt wrong about it, like a movie set that was almost convincing but not quite.

""Mr. Patterson!"" Dr. Vance was younger than I'd expected, maybe forty, with the kind of confident smile that suggested he was very good at his job. ""I didn't expect to see you back so soon. Is everything alright?""

""I don't remember being here.""

""Well, of course not. *That's rather the point.*"" He gestured for me to sit in his office, which was decorated with certificates I couldn't quite read and brain scan images that might have been stock photos. ""You came to us in considerable distress. Persistent nightmares, flashbacks during the day, inability to concentrate. Classic symptoms of traumatic memory syndrome.""

""What trauma?""

Dr. Vance consulted a file. ""You were reluctant to discuss the specifics, which is common. Patients often find it too painful to verbalize the memories they want removed. But you were very clear that you wanted them gone completely.""

""And now they are?""

""Now they are."" He leaned back in his chair, pleased. ""You should be feeling much better. Sleeping through the night, improved mood, better focus. Are you experiencing any of those benefits?""

I wasn't sleeping at all, but I didn't tell him that. ""What exactly did you remove?""

""I'm afraid I can't be specific without compromising patient confidentiality, even to you. The memories were extracted and disposed of according to medical waste protocols. *They no longer exist anywhere.*""

Something about the phrase ""*disposed of according to medical waste protocols*"" made my skin crawl. ""How is that even possible? You can't just delete memories.""

""Mr. Patterson, we're pioneering a revolutionary treatment. Targeted memory extraction using guided REM sleep manipulation. We identify the specific neural pathways associated with traumatic memories and essentially edit them out while you dream. It's like surgery, but for your subconscious.""

He showed me a consent form I'd apparently signed, authorizing the procedure. My signature looked right, but I had no memory of writing it.

""The most remarkable thing,"" Dr. Vance continued, ""*is that your brain automatically fills in the gaps. You won't feel like anything is missing because your mind will create plausible explanations for any inconsistencies. It's really quite elegant.*""

I left the office more confused than before. If the procedure had worked, why couldn't I sleep? Why did I feel like something important was missing, even if I couldn't identify what?

That night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, trying to remember what used to keep me awake. What nightmares had I been having? What memories had been so traumatic that I'd paid to have them removed?

Around 3 AM, I gave up and went to my computer. I started searching through my browser history, my emails, my social media, looking for clues about my life three weeks ago.

That's when I found the first gap.

My browser history showed normal activity up until three weeks ago: news sites, shopping, streaming services. Then *nothing* for five days. Then normal activity resumed, but different somehow. Different sites, different search patterns, like someone else had been using my computer.

My email showed the same pattern. Normal correspondence, then a gap, then resumption with subtly different habits. Shorter responses, different vocabulary, messages that sounded like me but not quite.

I checked my social media. Same thing. Posts and comments that were technically mine but felt foreign somehow.

It was like someone had been living my life for five days while I was... where? What had happened during those five days?

I called in sick to work and spent the day investigating my own life. Credit card statements showed normal purchases up until three weeks ago, then several days of no activity, then normal purchases that were somehow different. Different restaurants, different stores, different patterns.

I drove to the places I'd apparently visited after the memory extraction. A coffee shop I'd never been to where the barista greeted me by name. A bookstore where I'd apparently bought three books that were now on my shelf, books I didn't remember reading but had bookmarks in them with notes in my handwriting.

I was living a life that felt like mine but wasn't quite mine.

That evening, I called my sister Rachel. We talked every few weeks, so she'd be able to tell me if anything had changed about me recently.

""You sound different,"" she said almost immediately.

""Different how?""

""I don't know. Calmer? You seem less anxious than usual. Which is weird because you were really stressed out the last time we talked.""

""When was that?""

""About a month ago. You called me in the middle of the night, really upset about something. You wouldn't tell me what, but you said you were having trouble sleeping.""

""What was I upset about?""

""You don't remember? You were crying, Tom. You said something about how you couldn't live with what you'd done, but when I asked what you meant, you just hung up. I tried calling back but you didn't answer.""

I had no memory of that conversation. No memory of being upset enough to cry, no memory of doing something I couldn't live with.

""Rachel, have I seemed different to you lately?""

""Actually, yes. The last few times we've talked, you've been almost... cheerful. It was nice, but kind of surprising. You'd been so depressed for months before that.""

Months of depression I couldn't remember. A traumatic event I'd done something about. A middle-of-the-night call to my sister that had been erased from my mind along with whatever had prompted it.

I hung up and went back to my computer, searching deeper into my digital history. I recovered deleted files, checked backup folders, looked through everything I could find.

In a folder of photos I'd forgotten about, I found pictures from six months ago. Pictures of me with a woman I didn't recognize. We looked happy together, intimate. There were dozens of photos spanning what looked like several months of a relationship.

I'd never seen her before in my life.

Her name was Elena, according to the photo metadata. I searched my email for her name and found months of correspondence that I didn't remember. Love letters, arguments, plans for a future together. The messages stopped abruptly four months ago after what looked like a terrible fight.

According to my own emails, I'd been planning to propose to her. According to her last message to me, she never wanted to see me again because of something I'd done. Something unforgivable.

I found her phone number in my contacts and called her.

""Tom?"" She sounded shocked. ""Why are you calling me? I told you,""

""I don't remember you,"" I said.

Silence.

""What do you mean you don't remember me?""

""I found photos of us. Emails. But I have no memory of ever meeting you.""

""That's not funny, Tom. After what you did, pretending you don't remember is just *cruel*.""

""What did I do?""

""You know what you did."" Her voice was shaking. ""*You killed him. You killed Marcus and then you tried to make me help you cover it up. When I wouldn't, you threatened me. You said if I told anyone, you'd hurt my family*.""

The line went dead.

I sat in my apartment, holding my phone, trying to process what she'd said. I'd killed someone named Marcus. I'd threatened Elena. I'd been so traumatized by what I'd done that I'd paid to have the memories removed.

But I couldn't remember any of it.

I couldn't remember being the kind of person who could kill someone.

I spent the rest of the night searching for information about Marcus. I found a news article from four months ago: ""Local Man Missing After Night Out."" Marcus Chen, 34, had disappeared after leaving a bar downtown. His car was found abandoned near the river. Police suspected foul play but had no leads.

I recognized his face from photos in the article. Not because I remembered him, but because I found pictures of him on my phone. Pictures I'd taken of him unconscious in what looked like the trunk of my car.

**I had killed Marcus Chen**. I had photographs of it. And then I'd paid nearly three thousand dollars to forget I'd ever done it.

The worst part wasn't discovering I was a murderer. The worst part was realizing I'd been living peacefully for three weeks, sleeping well (until recently), feeling calm and happy, while Marcus's family still wondered what had happened to him.

I'd deleted my own guilt and left his body wherever I'd hidden it.

I called Dr. Vance.

""I want my memories back,"" I said.

""Mr. Patterson, that's not how the procedure works. The memories are gone. They can't be restored.""

""You said they were disposed of as medical waste. Where?""

""I'm sorry, but I can't""

""I killed someone,"" I said. ""I killed someone and I can't remember where I put the body because you deleted it from my brain.""

Silence on the other end.

""Mr. Patterson, I think you should come in so we can discuss this properly.""

""Can you restore the memories or not?""

""The extracted memories are stored temporarily in case of adverse reactions. *Theoretically*, they could be reintegrated, but I strongly advise against it. You came to us in severe psychological distress. Restoring traumatic memories could cause significant psychological damage.""

""I need to know what I did.""

""And then what? You'll turn yourself in to police? Destroy your life over something you can no longer change? You paid us to give you peace. Don't throw that away.""

""What about Marcus's family? Don't they deserve to know what happened to him?""

""Mr. Patterson, you're not the same person who committed whatever crime you're worried about. That person no longer exists. His memories, his guilt, his trauma, all gone. You're essentially a new person now. Why should a new person suffer for crimes committed by someone who no longer exists?""

I hung up and drove to his office.

The building was empty except for security. Dr. Vance was working late, which told me he'd been expecting me. 

""Mr. Patterson. Please, sit down.""

""I want my memories back.""

""I've prepared the reintegration procedure,"" he said, gesturing to a medical chair with electrodes attached. ""But I want you to understand what you're asking for. These memories were so traumatic that they were destroying your life. Restoring them will bring back all of that pain.""

""I need to know.""

""And afterwards? When you remember what you did, when you feel the full weight of your guilt again, what then?""

""I'll do the right thing.""

Dr. Vance nodded sadly. ""*The right thing*. Yes, that's what they all say.""

""They all?""

""Mr. Patterson, you're not our first client to request memory reintegration. About twenty percent of our patients eventually come back, usually when they discover evidence of their extracted memories. We restore the memories, they leave determined to 'do the right thing,' and within a week, they're back asking us to extract them again.""

""How many times have I been here?""

He consulted my file. ""This will be your fourth memory extraction. You killed Marcus Chen in self-defense during a mugging. You hid his body in Riverside Park, near the old playground. You've remembered this, confessed to police, served two months in jail while awaiting trial, were released on bail, and then come to us to forget again. Three times.""

""Why would I forget if it was self-defense?""

""Because even justified killing leaves trauma. Because you still took a life. Because Marcus's family harassed you after the trial, sending death threats and protesting outside your apartment. Because the media made you into a monster even though you were legally cleared. Because you couldn't live with the memory of what it felt like to watch someone die, even someone who was trying to hurt you.""

He showed me newspaper clippings from my trials. Photos of protestors with signs saying ""*Justice for Marcus*."" Articles describing me as a killer who'd escaped punishment on a technicality.

""Each time you remember, you try to do the right thing. You turn yourself in, you apologize to his family, you try to make amends. And each time, the system and society crush you for it. So you come back to us.""

""And you just... let me forget again?""

""We give you peace. We give you a life free from trauma and guilt. Isn't that worth something?""

I looked at the medical chair, at the electrodes that would restore memories I'd paid to lose four times.

""What happens if I don't restore them?""

""You go home. You live your life. Marcus's body stays where it is, and his family continues to wonder what happened to him. But *you* get to be happy.""

""And if I do restore them?""

""You remember everything. The mugging, the fight, the feeling of your hands around his throat as you defended yourself. The sound he made when he died. The weight of his body as you carried it to the park. The smell of the dirt as you buried him. The look on his family's face when you confessed. The hatred in their eyes. The way the other inmates treated you in jail. *All of it*.""

""And then I'll come back here in a week asking you to make me forget again?""

""Probably.""

I sat in that chair and tried to decide who I wanted to be. The person who could live peacefully with hidden knowledge of a buried body, or the person who would remember every detail of taking a life and being destroyed by the consequences.

Dr. Vance was right about one thing: I wasn't the same person who had killed Marcus Chen. That person had been erased and rebuilt four times. The memories, the trauma, the guilt that had shaped him; none of it existed in me anymore.

But Marcus's body was still in Riverside Park.

His family was still wondering what happened to him.

And I was still benefiting from a crime I couldn't remember committing.

""Do it,"" I said.

Dr. Vance attached the electrodes and activated the machine.

The memories came back like a flood. All of them. Not just the killing, but every time I'd remembered it and tried to do the right thing. Every confession, every trial, every moment of harassment and trauma. Four cycles of memory, guilt, confession, punishment, and erasure.

I remembered being this exact person in this exact chair three times before, making this exact decision.

I remembered that tomorrow I would call the police and confess to Marcus's murder.

I remembered that they would tell me I'd already confessed three times before and been cleared each time.

I remembered that Marcus's family would call me a monster who was taunting them.

I remembered that in one week, I would be back in this chair asking Dr. Vance to make me forget again.

And I remembered that he would do it, *because that's what I was paying him for*.

*The cycle would continue forever unless I broke it.*

But I couldn't break it by remembering or by forgetting.

I could only break it by choosing not to be the person who needed to forget.

""Dr. Vance,"" I said as he removed the electrodes, ""I want you to extract something else this time.""

""What?""

""The desire to confess. Leave me the memory of what I did, but take away the compulsion to turn myself in. Let me live with what I know without being driven to destroy myself over it.""

""That's... more complex than simple memory extraction. We'd be altering personality traits, decision-making patterns. The psychological implications -""

""Can you do it?""

He thought for a moment. ""Yes. But you'd essentially become someone who could live with being a killer. Someone who could keep that secret permanently. Are you sure that's who you want to be?""

I thought about Marcus, alone in the dark under six feet of dirt in Riverside Park.

I thought about his family, still posting his missing person flyers around town.

I thought about the version of me who would wake up tomorrow and not feel compelled to confess, who would drive past those missing person flyers and feel nothing.

""Yes,"" I said. ""*That's exactly who I want to be*.""

Because the alternative was an endless cycle of remembering and forgetting, and Marcus would stay buried either way.

Did a DTC-focused event in New York City, and I thought I’d share some of the stuff.(we’re in DTC biz, event was geared towards helping clients grow)

To save money I made coffee(big urns, bought essa-bagel)did cleaning and all logistics myself. Would have been 8-10k  more to hire a planner and Cater it.
(Don’t do it if you aren’t ready for a shit storm.)

Im used to stress but it was still a handful. Worth it? We will see. I would 100% don’t logistics and coffee myself again. I had a restaurant make 10 trays of food and deliver(carmines NYC)

I posted about it probably 200-300 times last 60 days. 

140 signups 
80-100 attendees. (We have heard 20-30% will no show)

We had a tight registration but it got overwhelming so we let some people in w/o registration. 

Cost about 9700

That’s broken down in the photo. 
Various branding, printing, badges etc. 

Costs were split up amongst agencies and tech partners. 

With 35 of us or so it was pretty cheap imo. 

All the agencies were asked to bring a few people from brands so it would be a good mix. 

Context:

When a larger event got postponed, we saw an opportunity to bring together a mix of agencies and brands to fill that gap. 

I liked going to grow NY (DTC event)which had been postponed. It’s typically full of DTC marketers and brands. I use it for insp on how to adapt to challenges in DTC growth. 

As an agency we have never looked at it as a client pool. 


But last year we opened up some spots for digital marketing clients…


So this event was meant to be a spot to entertain and show off what we do. 

I didn’t want it to be a boring one sided “this is how great we are” so I invited about 30 agencies I have contacts with. 

I asked a dozen people to present 10 of those are agencies. 

I made sure to invite agencies(to speak) that wouldn’t compete directly with each other, which made for a collaborative atmosphere. For example, we had two creative agencies, but one specializes in Meta and TikTok ads, while the other focuses on high-budget TV commercials for larger brands.

Other topics….Google ads, Email.

had a conversion rate optimization agency do a talk, 

our MC is a CEO  from a kids’ baseball apparel brand that recently skyrocketed in popularity, going from a few million a year to $30 million in a single month. That he’s a great mc was pure luck. I had no idea. 

One major thing….was during talks make sure that each agency highlighted their unique expertise without overlapping topics. We don’t want the next speaker to be a counterpoint.



No pissing  matches. 

Overall, it was a good experience. Super super stressful. 

I made the coffee did about 90% of the logistics and labor myself. 

Day of my agency had all hands on deck so that was helpful. 

I worked half my life in restaurants and bars so I served most of the day then I spoke to some clients at skylark in NYC afterwards.

We don’t necessarily need clients right now but I’m thinking we can squeeze one more in, so hopefully this was fruitful. ",1,1753328207.0,agency,0,0.67,False

So, I wanted to say that I posted something really personal to me regarding my family and, in particular, my twin sister who has never really saw me as anything as a burden to her.   When I've posted on other boards, I've gotten bullied off or at least, had a few trolls.  

This is literally the only board (outside of my love of the TV show ""You"", since I was an extra and used to wait on the main actor, Penn, who is an amazing guy), where I have received nothing but support.  

I understand if this post is deleted but I have been having a really hard time lately and the fact that so many people took the time to write so many reasons why I am not a freak for liking extreme horror lit or that it means I am someone who needs therapy, which just makes me feel incredibly rejected, is very important to me.

1m7ttja,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1m7ttja/i_kept_waking_up_tired_bloated_and_foggy_my_labs/,"I kept waking up tired, bloated, and foggy, my labs were ""normal."" But, heres what finally helped.","I debated posting this because I still feel like I’m figuring things out, but maybe this helps someone like me - tired, frustrated, and invisible on paper.

I’m 32F, no major medical conditions. But for the last couple years, I was *exhausted*. I could sleep 9 hours and still feel like a zombie. I had mood swings, zero libido, my face looked puffy all the time, and my brain felt… slow. I’d forget why I walked into a room. And yet, every time I went to the doctor, my labs were “normal.”

I started wondering if it was burnout or just life post - 30, but something didn’t feel right.

Eventually I went to a functional medicine NP, and while nothing was “clinically wrong,” she showed me I had low-normal thyroid markers and borderline vitamin deficiencies. She didn’t push meds but instead suggested some daily changes.

Here’s what REALLY helped me over the next 90 days:

* **Iodine + vitamin A. Together** : never knew how connected they were to thyroid. Took a spray form under the tongue.
* Cut out seed oils, added more whole eggs, avocado, and grass-fed meat.
* Switched coffee to mid-morning instead of first thing on an empty stomach.
* Walked outside first thing every morning for 10 mins.
* Started journaling my symptoms daily (I thought this was silly, but it helped so much.)

I’m not claiming this fixed everything, but my energy is 80% better, I’m mentally sharper, and my cycle is pretty regulated for the first time in months.

If anyone wants details, happy to share more, what I used and what makes up my daily routine. Just wanted to say: if you feel off but the tests say you’re fine, *you’re not crazy*.",1,1753327973.0,PCOS,2,1.0,False

For the past few weeks, I’ve been waking up with a dull, persistent headache centered around my forehead and temples. It’s not severe, but it’s enough to make mornings miserable.  

**Possible factors I’ve considered:**  
- **Dehydration?** I try to drink water before bed, but maybe not enough.  
- **Sleep posture?** I’m a side sleeper—could neck strain be the culprit?  
- **Teeth grinding?** No jaw pain, but I’ve never been checked for bruxism.  
- **Sleep apnea?** I don’t snore loudly, but I sometimes wake up briefly.  
- **Caffeine/alcohol?** I usually have one coffee after lunch.  

**What I’ve tried:**  
- Adjusting pillow height  
- Limiting screen time before bed  
- Hydrating more in the evening (but then I wake up to pee…)  

Has anyone else dealt with this? Did you find a cause or fix? I’d love to hear your experiences or tips.",2,1753327963.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

Long walks, quiet nights in, clean eating, podcasts etc. But then I remembered dive bars exist and if you’re lucky there’s a lady with a hot dog cart is outside. My ideal first date is you and me, a drink at the bar and after you already start to think you’ve fallen for me you see me inhale 3 hot dogs you know that it’s true love. But if yours is a walk on the beach I can be flexible - there are usually hot dog vendors there as well. 

I’m down to earth, easy going and I don’t stress the small stuff. I’m not looking for anything specific but I expect any relationship I hold - romantic or platonic - to be reciprocal. If we can’t laugh together I don’t want it. Be up front and be transparent and we will be fine. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

•Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the SF Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they’re really bad most of the time. I also went to an NHL game last season…impeccable vibes. Still no clue what was happening. Loved the vibes though. 

•Weight Lifting: I’m a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. 

•Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. 

•Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to quite a few already this year and will probably get in a few more. I love music and I love discovering music. 

Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/hdjrOrS  5’6ish. Thick. Again lifts weights. Eats hot dogs. Yada yada. Do actually live a clean lifestyle as well. Would also love to see a photo of you sooner rather than later. Attraction needs to be mutual. Lucky for you my type is a melting pot. 

I don’t like video games or anime. You can have your hobby’s but these seem to be prevalent in a lot of people as personality traits. So hobby? Fine. Literally the only thing you do on the weekends? Not for me!

1m7tsej,https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1m7tsej/a_game_i_want_to_make/,A game i want to make.,"Hey fellow gamers. Latley I've been trying to learn how to create my own game i want to make an isometric, rpg, monster collecting and battling game. At this point my vision is waaay larger than my skill. Anyway I've been playing with a couple ideas. I've always loved monster collecting games, and isometric RPGs, but I also like Dark humor abd watching people get offended. So I've been writing out this idea for a game. Can you tell me if its something you would play, or should I go back to the writing board?

Name:Grimehaven

Grimehaven is  a sprawling, fictional urban wasteland. Think cyberpunk meets post apocalyptic decay, neon lit alleys, abandoned buildings, and bustling black markets. The city is alive with factions, dealers, and underground fight clubs where your collectibles, let’s call them Street Spirits, (still working on the name) battle for dominance.

Collectibles: Instead of the normal monster hunting games, in my game you collect Street Spirits, archetypal urban drifters with distinct personalities, backstories, and combat styles. Each has a unique vibe e.g., Meth Mouth Marv or Cardboard Carl,and evolves through exposure to various substances or environmental factors.
The tone will be darkly satirical, leaning into absurd humor and social commentary. Think Borderlands meets South Park, with a touch of urban folklore.

Gameplay Mechanics
Collection System/
Scouting: You explore the city’s districts e.g., The Neon Slums, The Docks, The Underpass, (any other location ideas are welcomed) to recruit Street Spirits. Each district has unique characters with specific traits. For example, the Docks might have Salty Sam, who wields a fishbone shiv, while the Slums have Dumpster Diva, who hurls flaming trash.

Recruitment: Instead of catching with something like Pokeballs, you lure Street Spirits with items like cheap booze, expired energy drinks, or shiny trinkets. Each Spirit has a Trust Meter that you fill by offering the right items or completing their personal quests e.g., helping Rusty Ron"" find his lost shopping cart.

Rarity: Some Spirits will be rare, like The Pigeon Whisperer, a legendary figure who controls a flock of attack pigeons, only appearing during specific in game events like a city wide blackout.

Battle System:
Street Fights: Battles take place in back alleys, abandoned lots, or underground arenas. Each Spirit has a set of moves based on their backstory and environment e.g., Bottle Toss, Sewer Splash, or Mad Rant, for psychological damage.

Team Dynamics: You can assemble a crew of up to four Spirits, each with synergy effects. For example, pairing  Screamin Sally, who disorients enemies with high-pitched yells with Chain-Swinger Chet, a melee brute, boosts their combo attacks.

Status Effects: Drugs and substances act as power-ups but come with risks. For example, giving a Spirit Blue Haze, a fictional drug might boost speed but lower defense, while Moldy Coffee, increases stamina but risks a Crash debuff.
Leveling and Evolution:

Substance System: Instead of traditional XP, Spirits level up through exposure to substances or experiences. For example:
Red Rush, a synthetic stimulant boosts attack but shortens their lifespan in battles.
Glow Juice, a bioluminescent street drug, unlocks psychic like abilities but risks addiction, reducing control in fights.
Street Wisdom, gained from completing city quests evolves Spirits into more powerful forms, like Hobo Joe, becoming King of the Curb, with a crown made of bottlecaps or broken glass.

Environmental Evolution:
Spirits evolve based on where you train them. Training in the Toxic Sewers might turn a Spirit into a poison type brawler, while the Rooftop Squats could unlock acrobatic moves.

Risk/Reward: Overdosing a Spirit on substances can lead to permanent stat loss or even retirement, they wander off into the city, never to return, adding strategic depth.

Factions and Rivalries:
The city is divided into rival gangs like the Alley Cats who are nimble thieves, the Sewer Kings are brutish tank types, and Neon Cult are mystics who worship the city’s electric grid, really just meth heads. You can align with a faction to unlock exclusive Spirits, moves, or storylines, but it locks you out of others.
Rival trainers, called Crew Bosses, challenge you in key locations, each with themed teams. For example, Boss Razor runs a crew of blade wielding Spirits in the Scrapyard District.

Additional Features
City Exploration:
Dynamic Events: The city changes based on in game time or player actions. A rainstorm might flood the sewers, spawning water type Spirits, while a heatwave could increase aggression in battles.

Black Market: Trade items, substances, or even Spirits in shady markets. Rare items like Glitter Dust, boosts charisma based attacks, are only available through risky deals that might trigger a police raid event.

Safehouses: Customize your base with scavenged furniture or defenses. You can store extra Spirits here or train them in a makeshift gym.

Story and Quests:
Main Story: You’re a nobody trying to become the city’s Underlord, the ultimate street boss. To do so, you must defeat the Council of Cranks, a group of legendary Street Spirits who control Grimehaven’s underworld.

Side Quests: Each Spirit has a personal arc. For example, helping Lost Lenny find his old guitar unlocks his Ballad of the Streets move, which buffs allies. These quests add depth and make players care about their crew.

Moral Choices: Decisions impact the city and your Spirits. Do you share your stash of Glow Juice with a struggling Spirit or hoard it for battles? Sharing might unlock loyalty bonuses but weaken your team temporarily.

Customization:
Spirit Customization: Equip Spirits with gear scavenged from the city, like a hubcap shield or a spiked jacket, which alters stats or adds new moves.

Player Avatar: Create your own street persona, choosing from styles like punk, cyber-tramp, or gutter shaman. Your look affects how NPCs and factions interact with you.
Crew Name: Name your crew e.g., The Asphalt Apostles and unlock graffiti tags to mark your territory, boosting morale in controlled districts.

Multiplayer:
Street Tournaments: Compete in online battle arenas styled like underground fight clubs. Players wager in game currency or rare items on the outcome.

Crew Wars: Team up with friends to take on rival crews in co-op battles or defend your turf in open-world PvP zones.

Trading: Trade Spirits or items via the black market, with a risk of scams e.g., receiving a fake Spirit that’s weaker than advertised.

Aesthetic and Tone will be  neon-drenched cyberpunk visuals. Think dark alleys lit by flickering signs, with Spirits animated in exaggerated, cartoonish styles to keep it playful rather than bleak.

I think for the soundtrack I'll go for Lo-fi hip hop mixed with industrial beats and distorted street sounds e.g., sirens, breaking glass. Each district has its own musical vibe, like trap for the Slums or synthwave for the Neon District.

Thats what I have so far. I'm open to any ideas and criticisms. I am aware of how large the scale of undertaking a project like this is, especially for someone who has only made a donut in blender, but it gives me something to work towards.",1,1753327871.0,videogames,2,1.0,False

1m7tqnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/1m7tqnn/3_months_of_constant_under_eye_twitch_along_with/,3 months of constant under eye twitch along with other sporadic bodily twitches.  BFS? Hemifacial Spasm? Sinus Pressure?,"Hi all, in October 2024 I started to get intense sinus pressure and radiating headaches. I started having some tingling sensations on the left side of my face - around my mouth and cheek and some numbness too. I got a brain MRI to rule out anything sinister (because the pressure and headaches became so strong) in December 2024 which found that I had chronic sinusitis. I eliminated a lot of inflammatory foods from my diet and made sure I got a lot of rest etc and the pressure mainly subsided.

3 months ago I started getting a persistent and fast twitch under my left eye. Very noticeable and has been something I’m feeling pretty self conscious about when socialising. I started to notice other twitches in different parts of my body but these are more random, short lived and move around. I’ve been to the doctor and they have done some blood work to check Vitamin B levels and magnesium and all is fine.

I’ve looked into BFS but the under eye twitch seems too persistent and constant for that. I’m concerned it could become a Hemifacial Spasm. Hoping that my maxillary or ethmoid sinus is just putting pressure on a nearby nerve but thought something like that would have shown on the brain MRI back in December.

I take magnesium, zinc and get about 8-9 hours sleep a night. Don’t drink coffee or even have caffeinated tea! Not under any intense stress/anxiety aside from this starting to drive me a bit crazy.

I have a 2017 XLT 6.2 with the 3.73 rear. 160,000km (100k freedom units) and i love the truck. It has a camper package and it’s a 3/4 ton so it’s never rode great… but it seems to have a consistent shimmy all through the truck (not just the front end or steering wheel) at pretty much any speed.

I was going through kind of a rough time trying to get over the things my mom did and analyzing my childhood and everything, but a couple months ago I decided to stop thinking about all of it and pretend it never happened! Surprisingly, I think it's working.

I'm living at home now, and I was struggling with constantly remembering things. I started involuntarly age regressing a lot, and my phobia of my mother was extremely strong. Now it's way better, and I can be around her often.

Everything is fine if I don't think about it. I won’t even bring any of it up in this post because I don't want to recall anything. It's like there’s this huge mental block, and as long as I don’t break it down, everything is fine.

1m7tml0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7tml0,I think seeing all of this now makes sense in ways I hadn't realized before.,"Full Analysis of the Christmas Arc

This arc isn't just about a simple gift exchange. It's a secret operation meticulously planned by Hayato, with a single goal: to make Ami happy, protecting her innocence, and working within her limitations.

Phase 1: The Preparation (The Shopping Trip)
Ami's Wish: We see that Ami wants an expensive exercise machine and declares she'll buy it, asking ""Santa"" for it.

Hayato's Intervention: He actively stops her (""Don't buy it now! Give it back!""). This is proof that he already had his plan in place. If she bought it, his surprise would be ruined.

The Strategic Suggestion: Hayato suggests the cheaper alternative, the AB Roller, and sells it to her as a ""nicer"" or ""more adorable"" option. He's managing her expectations and guiding her toward the gift he can afford. By this point, he's already done his mental ""double trip"" and knows exactly what he's going to do.

Phase 2: The Public Sacrifice (The Gift Exchange)
The ""Fake"" Gift: The story confirms that there was a formal gift exchange. Hayato participates, knowing that his public gift is, in essence, garbage: three coffee coupons.

The Accepted Humiliation: As expected, Ouka receives his gift and her reaction is pure disappointment. She calls him ""cheap"" and throws the coupons in his face.

The Dramatic Irony: This is the most tragic and comical part. Hayato accepts being seen as a stingy person and a bad friend by everyone else. He's willing to sacrifice his own public image. Why? Because his true mission, the gift for Ami, was more important. The ""stinginess"" Ouka sees is actually the consequence of his immense generosity toward Ami.

Phase 3: The Private Reward (The ""Santa"" Moment)
The Revelation: After the public chaos, Hayato approaches Ami and asks about the gift ""Santa"" left him. Her satisfied face says it all: his plan has worked perfectly.

Ami's Perfect Reaction: Her response is the culmination of her tsundere persona, as we can deduce:

Internal Anger (Tsun): She thinks, ""Hayacchi, do you think I'm some kind of idiot?"" She feels exposed.

External Acceptance (Blend of Tsun and Dere): She says out loud, ""Thanks for the ab wheel. I know you're poor."" She acknowledges the gesture, thanks him, and at the same time protects her pride by mentioning his situation.

Final Conclusion
Looking at all the pages, the Christmas arc was a covert operation by Hayato to prove his love for Ami. He was willing to:

Meticulously plan a complex surprise.

Subtly manipulate Ami into accepting a cheaper gift.

Sacrifice his reputation and be publicly humiliated.

All for a single moment of intimate happiness and to protect the innocence of the girl he loves.

Now I understand what Hekiru is trying to say in the Ouka de Tsun Dere arc, at least that's what he implies.

I think Hayato went too far, don't you think? xd

All in all, his plan was perfect:

Step 1: He stops Ami from buying the gift herself.

Step 2: He secretly returns to buy her the cheap version.

Step 3: He shows up at the exchange, knowing he'll be humiliated.

Step 4: He puts up with being called ""cheap.""

Step 5: He secretly gives Ami the real gift, fulfilling Santa's fantasy and strengthening their bond.",0,1753327374.0,GoddessCafeTerrace,1,0.5,False
1m7tm9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1m7tm9d/i_graduated_yesterday_my_birth_story/,I graduated yesterday! My birth story,"It's been a bit of a whirlwind, and a bit challenging, but I wouldn't change it for the world!  
Funny enough, I had a late growth scan on Monday to see how big our baby girl was, and they measured her at 8lbs 1oz. I originally had an appointment earlier today to discuss what the plan would be based on this information. But then at 3:30am Tuesday morning, my water broke. Baby girl had other plans.  
I called the hospital, but they said there were no OBs on-staff that night, and to call back at 8am to see if anyone would be in, and to just monitor fetal movement or if I experienced any pain, to go to the nearest hospital.  
So we set an alarm and tried to go back to sleep. But between the sudden rush of adrenaline of my water breaking and the mild contractions that were starting, I didn't manage to get any more sleep.  
We called back at 8am, and they told us to go in and they could exam me and go from there. We had a quick breakfast and coffee, and off we went.  
They recommended inducing me to get things moving, because if I just waited for labour to happen naturally, it could take longer and only increases the risk of infection. They hooked up the IV with saline and pitocin, and we were off to the races. About an hour and a half later, they did a cervix check and said I was already 7-8cm dilated. So it was already too late for the option of an epidural.  
Then the contractions started getting intense, and fast. I am forever grateful for my partner being there beside me to help me through it.  
After a bit, they told me she wasn't quite low enough, so I had to help her along. And to do so, I had to hold my breath once a contraction happened, and ""push like you're trying to fart"", but not a full push. So I did, and it was getting to the point where I just had the urge to push. Then they told me it was time to actively start pushing.  
An hour later, and our baby girl made her appearance. And she was healthy. I was so relieved.  
Surprisingly, from the time my water broke to baby girl coming into this world, it took 13 and a half hours total. Active labour lasted about 5 hours, and I only pushed for 1 hour.  
I unfortunately burst several capillaries in my face and a bit on my chest. It looks like I had a bad reaction to some skin cream. We currently have to stay in the hospital longer than anticipated because her blood test results came back and her bilirubin number was high risk for jaundice, so they're currently doing UV light therapy on her.  
It's been a challenging couple of days, with lots to learn, but I'd do it all over again for her.",2,1753327345.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False

My best friend and I met through our high school sports team freshman year and were nearly inseparable throughout high school. We went to different colleges (10 hours apart) and weren’t the best about maintaining constant contact, but always spent time together when we were back in our hometown. 

On a trip to visit her in 2021, I came out to her as trans and she came out to me as bisexual. She’d asked if it had impacted my sexuality (I’d only previously dated men) and I said I hadn’t figured that part out yet. 

I started analyzing my sexuality after I was a little more settled into my transition and realized I had only ever “gotten butterflies” when interacting with women. Not only that, but previous desires started to make sense. Especially during our senior year of high school, we would talk about essentially running away together and operating a little roadside bakery/coffee shop.

I had finally worked up the courage to tell her I had feelings for her in September 2022 at a pride event we attended together, but before I could get the words out, she told me she and her boyfriend of a few months had moved in together. I bit my tongue and have continued to keep my feelings to myself for the past three years, even as they’ve grown to a point where every future I picture contains us side by side. 

Each time we’ve hung out since then, she’s confided discontents in me about her current boyfriend—from minor, roommate type issues, to more concrete problems with him not prioritizing her in their life. They relocated for his job and are now two hours from all of her family and friends and she’s had to get a remote job (the remote aspect of which she dislikes) because her local market is oversaturated. They rarely do her hobbies together, where it seems like she is expected to participate to a greater degree in his hobbies. This past time I went to visit her, she seemed more frustrated with her situation than I’d ever seen her. 

I want to tell her I’m here for her and that she has options if she’s not content with her current situation—not in a “pick me” way but rather a “please prioritize yourself instead of some guy who doesn’t prioritize you” kind of way. I want to tell her that she can rant to me, I can visit more, she can come stay with me, or I can help her move somewhere else—whatever would help her to have a better situation. But I feel like I can’t do that without divulging my conflict of interest.

1m7tljc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m7tljc/very_long_lost_my_best_friend_and_feeling_more/,[VERY LONG] - Lost My Best Friend and Feeling More Alone Than Ever (could use some kindness but just wanted to put it out there to feel it),"I've tried to sit down and write this several dozen times it feels like. I've been alone for almost 3 years and have had to move at least once, sometimes twice, a year for 10 years now.

My best friend (C), her fiancé (W), and I lived together for 7 of those years, moving every single year. It was fine because I had them and they were great people, but during the 7th year they broke up and my best friend moved out without even talking to me about it. I got a text asking to take care of him. I did, of course. I loved both of them.

She came back a couple weeks later crying as she hugged and apologized to me. It was so much anxiety off of my back. I was so relieved that she wasn't just gone. We talked it out and hung out many times over the next couple of months until W and I moved into a smaller place that was another 30 minutes away from C, who had moved to the city about an hour away.

It made seeing her hard, and I didn't have a car at the time because I worked from home and lived in an area with amazing public transit (rare, I know) I had a card for work even though I worked from home, so I rode for free always, so it made sense.

Anyway, C and I saw less and less of each other. I offered to come to her via bus, even though it was a 5-hour trip (though I didn't tell her that) or I'd offer to give her gas money for picking me up for a weekend. But that meant 3 hours on either end of the weekend. It was hard.

She was having issues with her antidepressants not working and was constantly getting new ones until she ran out. As a result of the constant side effects of her medications changing constantly, weeks or months without it, or when she started clinical trials for ketamine, things got really stressful.

I suffer from depression but not nearly on the same level as C, but I have terrible separation anxiety as well. Months of calling off plans last minute, getting mad at me about things then ruminating on them silently, and eventually yelling about something that we'd normally have laughed off in person, or played back and forth with over-the-top insults and whatnot, eventually wore me down.

I started getting angry back. Saying awful things, ignoring her, also ruminating on things. I started firing back more than she did to me and more consistently. I got lost in it.

We still tried to mend things and there were plenty of ""I love you"" moments between us and reminding each other it was just hard and we missed each other. I couldn't tell you who did it more often, but I meant it, and I believed she did too.

9 or 10 months of this, and we finally sat down in the same room. I hashed out all of my reasons and why I had been so upset and I apologized for very specific things and just for hurting her in general. I can't blame my anxiety alone, and I wouldn't try to excuse myself, so I apologize if it sounds like that.

She did the same and explained the trials and having her mom come stay with her because of suicidal thoughts. This is legitimately something she had happen alongside panic attacks and her seizures lately, and I had seen both plenty when we lived together.

We hugged in silence for a long time just crying. I felt so much weight off and we had made plans for her to come visit me since her and her family would be vacationing in Florida, near where I was going to live, and she wanted me to come with them. Her family knew that and she would often invite me to big life events. As a matter of fact, she always insisted I come, and they agreed. I was happy for a few days.

She died just 3 days later. Something about the ketamine and her seizure medication that I never got a clear answer on.

I was devastated. I didn't leave my room basically at all for the next week until I realized my cat needed food.

My roommate W, at this point, was not talking to me for several reasons. I had taken care of him and reintroduced him to new friends about 6 months prior and after I lost my job, I had been unemployed for 6 months and not having a car was becoming a problem, he stopped talking to me. He admitted to resenting me because I was a freeloader and decided he'd go out all the time and start sleeping around, until he met his current girlfriend who they would then ask me not to come out of my room while they were hanging out in the living room.

I told them that was fucking stupid and a terrible thing to ask, but there we were when they'd stare me down for walking out of the house or just into the kitchen to get water.

Anyway, with C dead and W not speaking to me, I was alone. More than I had ever been in my life. The constant moving and no car meant my friends were always an hour out and while a few visited me immediately to help, it didn't last more than 2 weeks.

I spent the rest of my lease alone in my room, unable to talk to the one person who might understand, but he was too bitter about their breakup and angry at me to care. He went on like nothing had changed.

I moved to Florida with my mother. It was supposed to be a short ""get back on my feet"" period, which turned into a year because I made plans to live with another friend in Ohio pretty early on, but it would be a year out, and that would give me time to get a car and save money.

I thought things would be better, but my grandmother who lives there too has dementia and I helped take care of her (which isn't a problem, but it was hard sometimes). My older brother was there and he is a bitter man with polarizing beliefs for lack of a better way to say it here who would yell at the top of his lungs whenever he could if anyone disagreed with him.

My depressed mother was just unable to stop to catch herself because of my grandmother and my older brother, who openly hates on her for ruining his marriage. She didn't, but he wants to blame someone that isn't himself or his ex-wife.

Whenever I'd talk to my grandmother, she'd forget I was speaking and walk off, or ask what I was talking about halfway through responding to her. It would often be as quick as 2 or 3 sentences, but she'd glaze over or forget.

My older brother couldn't hold a conversation without moving it to those polarizing things I mentioned like how our gay brother and his husband are dramatic and that violent crimes against ""his kind"" are overblown because they're such a low statistic compared to everyone else who gets murdered. MISSING THE POINT ENTIRELY.

I am bitter about him turning out the way he is, I'm sorry. But because of those things I couldn't talk to him peacefully or without him trying to gaslight me / convert me into hating our mother or convincing me our brother was a piece of shit.

My mother tried, but she was so depressed over her mom getting worse and my older brother disrespecting and badmouthing her to anyone who would listen that she didn't have it in her to talk to me without losing focus or having nothing to say.

I was alone again, and for a year this time. Closest I'd been with family in about a decade and I couldn't enjoy any time with them.

I moved to Ohio earlier this year. It was supposed to be a 14-hour drive over 2 days and then a day of recovery followed by going to a wedding as my friend's +1.

Her (K) and I had been friends for almost 15 years, and we even went on a few dates 2 years in, but we both agreed it wasn't gonna work and we didn't have it in us at the time and chose to remain friends.

We had been talking every day, almost all day over text, for about the whole year I was in Florida. I mean 6am to 12am almost EVERY DAY. It felt like we had become very close. We were joking around a lot in the same ways me and C did. I felt that hole being closed a little bit. It never will close fully.

I truly believe C was my platonic soul mate. I've never had a friend like her and don't believe I ever will, but this felt like something that was missing had come back and it was immensely comforting after so much time. K and I made many plans to binge shows, go on trips, and to introduce to some of the friends I met when she invited me to her group chat after it seemed like I got along really well with them.

The time of the move came and my boss asked me to give up one of the days because he mismanaged the PTO but said it was fine if not. I said it was fine and I'd leave a day late. Still had time to get there with some rest.

But then K told me she had gotten the date wrong and that it was the next day after I left at like 9am. I should have said I couldn't make the wedding, but I wanted to keep my word to her and I proceeded to drive it all in one day.

Though I didn't drive 14 hours. I drove 19. I left at 8:30AM and got there at 3:30AM. I got stuck in Atlanta for several hours, but I made it in one drive. I stopped 6 times for about 15 minutes at a time just because I needed to.

I didn’t go to the wedding and I nearly slept for 12 hours.

K and I talked about hanging out on Monday after she was done with the wedding and family stuff, and that was fine by me.

Monday comes and she says she has plans. I thought, okay, I'm new here and she probably got swept up in the excitement of me being there and forgot she had plans. That was fine to me. I just got there and was a new addition, so it made sense that she probably forgot.

She suggested Thursday or Friday, and I said Thursday because I had plans Friday. Cool, we had the game plan.

Wednesday comes by, I hadn’t seen her basically at all because of her job, by the way, and I suggest seeing a movie the next day because Thunderbolts was apparently pretty good for a Marvel movie.

She said, “My Sunday should be free,” and I asked, “What about Thursday? We had plans?” and she said, “Yeah, my Sunday is probably good” again.

I made a passive-aggressive joke saying, “Oof, I didn’t think I’d have to wait all week to hang out with you haha” and started walking toward my room a bit.

She looked at me with the most disgusted look I have ever seen someone use on me in my life. Not that it’s happened, but it was completely jarring. She just says, “I thought you just needed a roommate,” and walks off.

I was stunned. I had no idea what that meant.

Saturday rolls by, and we had talked a bit here and there, had a few good laughs, so I thought my anxiety had just spiked for a moment and it was cool.

I asked if we were still on for the next day during the evening and she texts me, “Do you even want to hang out?” as part of her message, which really confused me.

The rest of the text fucked with my head because what she was referring to was a joke regarding some fuzzy cuffs she pulled out of a dresser while cleaning. I had made some comment about “playing dress up” that was just in the moment and we laughed about it.

We had both said much “worse” things to each other over the last year. Nothing ever aggressive or inappropriate, just basic “oho someone likes to play” kind of stuff. This wasn’t even graphic, just a comment about playing dress-up to the extreme. Stupid and probably not funny, but we shared a laugh because it was stupid.

Anyway, she says in this text, “I gotta be honest I did not appreciate the comments when I was getting the rest of my stuff out of my drawers.”

I, not remembering, text back “comments?” because nothing registered in my head regarding it. It was such a throwaway line. I decided I didn’t want to go over it in text and immediately walked upstairs after and asked her what was up. She told me about it.

I apologized. I said:

“I apologize. That was definitely not my intent. We had both made tons of jokes like that and we both laughed about that specifically. I had no idea you had been holding onto that for a couple of days.”

I said more about how we had made worse jokes in DMs over the last year so it didn’t feel out there, but regardless of what I think, I apologized. It wasn’t my intention to hurt her feelings.

She said thank you, but then also, and this crushed me, “You make me feel uncomfortable and you came on too strongly.”

I’ve never been told my friendliness makes anyone uncomfortable before. Not to mention, I basically hadn’t seen her. I bought coffee for both of us twice, but that was because she recommended some places and I thought I’d repay her for the suggestions and it’d be nice as a new roommate.

But besides those moments and following up on when she wanted to hang out, I didn’t see her except for less than 5 minutes a day where I generally just would say hi and ask how her day was.

To be told I make her uncomfortable and that I came on too strongly... OBLITERATED me. I asked how and what I was doing that made her feel that way and she said ""I don't know"" and I suggested just shelving it for now and talking about it in the morning so she had time to process if need be. She said ok. The next day she brushed off my attempts to ask about it saying she had a long day. I never got an apology.

I’m still upset about it 3 months later as I’m getting ready to move out. We didn’t hang out that Sunday. I decided I wanted to take a day or so to myself and meet other people.

From that point on though, she actively walked away if I said hello and would never engage me if I asked how she was doing. She’d never return that politeness or listen when I told her about some weird thing I found exploring the city.

She would either walk away or start looking at her phone partway through and I’d have to ask after a few seconds if she was there, and she’d go “yeah sorry” then go back to her phone after I repeated myself. This would be one or two times and then I’d walk away, and she’d say sorry but never ask further.

I dropped a 20lb weight on my foot at the gym and had a severe limp. I asked her to help out if I needed to go to the doctor and to get some ice packs. She didn’t even ask if I was okay and just kept looking at her phone and didn't answer.

In the 3 months I’ve been here, she has never come to me to talk about anything, chat when we see each other, or even invited me to hang out. I would sometimes pop by her room when she was just scrolling her phone to say what’s up when her door was open. I did that several times over a couple of months and her door has remained closed since.

I’ve felt more alone than ever because now I’m a stranger living with someone who seemingly resents me and won’t look at me. I live in my room alone and roam an empty house on occasion. I’ve met some people in the city, but no one I’d call a new friend really. I’ve been too depressed, and I’ve slipped back into the same feeling as when C died.

I’ve been miserable and alone here, and I drove 19 hours to have this be my life. I’m moving 10 hours away in about a week, but I just feel like crying and I can’t for some reason.

I’m so hurt from this on top of the last 2 years. I just don’t know how to function and I know I shouldn’t be airing all of this, but I’m at my wits’ end and I feel completely alienated by K now and I don’t think the friendship is going to last after this.

But I honestly can’t tell what I did wrong.

Without C, I don’t have anyone close enough who has the emotional maturity to say more than “that sucks” and that’s not a dig on them because I love my other friends, but it’s not helpful and I don’t have anyone while I stew in the basement with my cat.

I feel broken and I can’t cry and it just sucks so badly. I don’t even have the words to describe how the last 2 1/2 years have been.

Hemifacial Spasm? Sinus Pressure?,"Hi all, in October 2024 I started to get intense sinus pressure and radiating headaches. I started having some tingling sensations on the left side of my face - around my mouth and cheek and some numbness too. I got a brain MRI to rule out anything sinister (because the pressure and headaches became so strong) in December 2024 which found that I had chronic sinusitis. I eliminated a lot of inflammatory foods from my diet and made sure I got a lot of rest etc and the pressure mainly subsided. 

3 months ago I started getting a persistent and fast twitch under my left eye. Very noticeable and has been something I’m feeling pretty self conscious about when socialising. I started to notice other twitches in different parts of my body but these are more random, short lived and move around. I’ve been to the doctor and they have done some blood work to check Vitamin B levels and magnesium and all is fine. 

I’ve looked into BFS but the under eye twitch seems too persistent and constant for that. I’m concerned it could become a Hemifacial Spasm. Hoping that my maxillary or ethmoid sinus is just putting pressure on a nearby nerve but thought something like that would have shown on the brain MRI back in December. 


I take magnesium, zinc and get about 8-9 hours sleep a night. Don’t drink coffee or even have caffeinated tea! Not under any intense stress/anxiety aside from this starting to drive me a bit crazy. 

Have some concern about MS, ALS, spinal tumour although feels unlikely…

1m7titj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m7titj/aitah_for_wanting_to_cut_my_brother_off_after_he/,Aitah for wanting to cut my brother off after he threatened to hit me?,"This is going to be long and messy. I (19F) am an international student studying in the US. I came home for the summer to spend time with my family. I have two older sisters and one older brother (27M, turning 28 this year). I’ve been wanting to book my flight back to the US for this August and usually I do so with the help of my brother so I approached him about it. Initially I wanted to go on the 1st, but he told me that it was early and I took his advice and chose to travel on the 6th, which I agreed upon with my roommate and friend. School starts on the 21st, however we just got an apartment and we want to have time to furnish it and settle into our new home before school starts again. 

My parents are divorced, so we only really see my dad on random occasions, or when we choose to sleepover there. My sister and I chose to sleep over around 2 weeks ago, and my brother and my other sister came by one day and had dinner with us and my dad. My brother brought up the idea of flying a little later then and that’s when I told him I’m okay flying on the 6th. After that, they went home to my moms and we stayed at our dads. When we got back home to our moms, my sister and I admittedly had a fucked up sleep schedule so we didn’t see much of my brother or my other sister. However, we’ve slowly started fixing it this week. 

Around two days ago, my mother told me to ask my brother to book my flight since obviously we’re approaching August and flights aren’t getting any cheaper. Then she leaves for work and my brother eventually wakes up. I leave him be for around 30 minutes. He does his laundry and tidies up and once I see him in the kitchen making his coffee, I take the opportunity and ask if he can book me a flight for the 6th. Keep in mind, I don’t need my brother to book me a flight. My mom wanted to herself, but my brother told her he wanted to do it, which is the only reason I spoke to him about it in the first place. 

My question ends up opening a whole can of worms, and he argues with me that I don’t need to be traveling on the 6th, that my friend and I made a thoughtless decision when we chose that day (not true. our move in date is on the 8th and it takes 24 hours to travel from our country to the US, so that’s basically the entirety of the 6th and we’d take advantage of the 7th to relax after a days worth of travel before moving in on the 8th). He argues I don’t need to be back that early, but I want to and that’s what my friend and I agreed upon. I told him we’d take a week to furnish and the other week to relax and prepare for school, to which he argued there was no need to prepare for school. This was all really annoying since it’s my life and I know what I need, and because my friend already booked her flight and we agreed on staying at a hotel together, so he’s just throwing a wrench in our plans for no reason. Then he mentions that my cousin is getting married on the 8th, and that I knew that and still chose to travel on the 6th, as if I planned it all maliciously this way. My cousin announced his wedding 2 weeks ago. My friend and I have been planning this for a while. Not to mention, I’m not close to him and we haven’t spoken since we were kids, so my presence doesn’t matter. I also found out my brother himself won’t be attending the wedding since he’ll be “traveling with friends”, but makes it such a big deal for me to attend it, even though he’s closer to my cousin than I am. 

After arguing for a decent 20 minutes, he ends it with raising his voice and telling me that I started this whole conversation disrespectfully anyways and basically ordered him to book me a flight. To which I was like?? What? I asked if you could book me a flight? It was a question. And because he knew I was telling the truth, he then said, yeah but the look on your face was just a disrespectful agitated one. And I was like?? What? Just because you don’t like how my face looked doesn’t change the fact that I asked you to book me a flight respectfully and you chose to twist that. He ended up storming off into his room and I had to leave to pick my oldest sister from a friends so we could see my dad. We go to my dads and I tell him all this, and he says my brother just cares about us, which I understand, but he’s so insanely aggressive and agitating with his ways that I can’t stand it. 

Anyways, we head back to my mom’s and the next morning, (yesterday), I’m up with my mom again and she asks if my brother booked me a flight. I said no, and she says she’ll just do it. So she finds me a flight and asks me if I’m sure he hasn’t, so I tell her I’m pretty sure, but she decides to get up and check so we don’t end up booking two tickets. My brother is sleeping, so she knocks on his door and asks if he booked me a ticket. He says no and she tells him she’s doing it, which I guess starts a whole argument that I can’t hear too well. My mom ends up leaving his room and closes the door behind her, which one would assume would be the end of the conversation. Instead, my brother gets up and flings the door open and storms into the living room after her, where I was sitting, and immediately starts yelling at me when I haven’t said a thing. My mother than defends me and says she’s the one who wants to book me a ticket, and they start arguing. He starts yelling about why I need to go on the 6th, not the 7th or 8th or 9th, and my mom says “let her go on the 6th! I don’t care.”. But for some reason he does. She asks if there aren’t flights on the 6th and only on the 7th or 8th or something, and he says there are flights on the 6th, so she’s confused on what the big deal is. 
It all starts a long argument, and he brings up how my friend and I didn’t think before booking or plan it properly, to which I argued that just because it wasn’t run by him doesn’t mean it wasn’t thought out. He said that we’re supposed to book together, but my friend and I wouldn’t have gotten on the same flight anyways (we live in different cities and she flies on a different airline), and either way, her father is the one booking for her, and he has work and travels a lot, so he’s going to book for her based on whenever he’s free, not based on whenever my brother plans for us to do this. 

Besides, I don’t understand the point of this because there are still available flights on the 6th, and we can still get there the same day together. Just because we’re not booking at the same minute together, doesn’t mean anything. He complains that he’s been telling me to book a ticket since a week ago, and my messed up sleep schedule won’t let him do anything, but I mention how it’s weird that he’s complaining because when I did approach him yesterday, all he did was yell and come at it aggressively. Keep in mind I haven’t yelled this whole conversation. He literally woke up and started yelling at me and my mom and my mother kept telling him to calm down. At some point in the conversation I had to point out to him that he was the only one yelling. 

Anyways, because I mentioned our conversation the day before, he decided to replay it and set the scene for my mother, telling her he had just woken up and I ordered him and told him aggressively to book me a flight for the 6th yesterday. To which I was like, what? I reminded him that I asked him respectfully, to which he brought up the look on my face again. My mother told him there was no point to bringing this up, and even if there was, what was I supposed to do about my face? He argued that there was a point, so she doesn’t hear a twisted version of it, which is ironic since he’s the only one twisting versions. My mother didn’t care and just wanted to book a flight for me using her miles, and he kept arguing and saying no because he knows better or whatever, and my mom says to show her the better option, which he argues and yells asking why he would be lying about that. And what she gets out of seeing it. She said she just wants to see it to be reassured, to which he kept arguing until he finally tried to show it to her, and lo and behold, the flight was no longer available just like my mother said. 

There was a lot of arguing being done, and at a certain point he was being so ridiculous that I guess I said something petty (I genuinely can’t remember what it was), to which he told me to stop being idiotic or something, and I was so fed up so all I said was that I wanted to be idiotic, and his reply to that was threatening to slap me across the face if I kept speaking that way. I didn’t have a chance to respond to that because my mother stepped in, but i find it funny that he can’t use his words to prove a point. Keep in mind, I didn’t say anything disrespectful. Maybe my tone was off and maybe I was acting childish, but I wasn’t disrespectful. I was just fed up. I didn’t say anything about him or his actions or his behavior (even though I could’ve). 

Anyways, my mom mentioned wanting to go to work (she was 30 minutes late at this point) and he told her to go, but she said she wasn’t leaving if we were gonna keep arguing. Honestly, I think he could’ve just gone back to sleep ages ago. Anyways, after all that, he told my mom to give it a day or two before booking just to see if prices get better (obviously at the risk of me not finding a flight back on the day I want to, but who cares right?) and he went back to bed. 

I’ve just been stressed and feeling heavy ever since that argument. It’s not the first time he’s threatened to hit me or my sisters. When they were kids, he actually used to hit my eldest sister. He threaten us often, but if we argue with him (which we don’t usually, since we usually just let things go or don’t interact with him much, for good reason), it can get to that point. Thing is, if my dad was living here, he couldn’t make that threat. He wouldn’t dare saying that in front of him. If he hit me once my dad would hit him 10x harder. But idk why this time it’s still making me so insanely angry. I don’t feel comfortable in my own home. I feel tension everywhere even when he’s asleep and I don’t want him around. My mom texted me and told me to send him back some money I owed him when she left for work (it was for something he offered to pay for but I was waiting on getting compensated for it before sending him the money.). I think she just doesn’t want me to be indebted to him. I just took money from my savings and sent it to him because I don’t want to owe him anything. It’s been a day since this happened and it’s still bothering me. I wanna tell my dad since I’m sure it’ll make him angry, and maybe he can take it out on him. I wanna leave this house just because he’s in it but I want to stay with my mom. I just don’t want him in my life. I don’t want his help with anything. My mom can book my flight, I don’t want him involved with that. He’s almost 30 threatening to hit a teenager. And he’s bigger and he works out. He’s on the lowest bar of masculinity there is. I hate him. I was okay with letting go of the argument we had the other morning when he was making coffee, but I don’t want to let this one go. I’m calm and collected, but he’s insane and needs therapy and makes me feel insane. I don’t know what to do. The crazy thing is, he thinks he’s in the right, that we all need him and we’re all idiots. But he’s just a controlling asshole. He even tries to control my mother. But then he wonders why my sisters and I leave him out. I just don’t know what to do. Would I be the asshole if I cut him off? If so, how would I even do that? Thanks and sorry for the long post.

This vibrant street has such a rich history that it's been designated as one of America's ""Great Streets"" by the American Planning Association.

Walking down 7th Avenue feels like stepping back in time. The street is lined with historic brick buildings from the late 1800s, when Cuban, Spanish, and Italian immigrants made this area Tampa's cigar manufacturing hub. Today, these buildings house an eclectic mix of restaurants, bars, boutiques, and entertainment venues.

During the day, you'll find locals and tourists exploring the unique shops, grabbing Cuban sandwiches (which were actually invented here in Tampa), and taking photos of the iconic architecture. At night, the street transforms into Tampa's entertainment district, with live music pouring out of venues and people bar-hopping between historic establishments.

One of my favorite experiences was joining a guided adventure tour near Tampa Bay. While exploring the city's famous streets is great, I also discovered an amazing zipline course at Mobbly Bayou Wilderness Preserve. It gave me a totally different perspective of the area - soaring above the landscape while seeing Tampa Bay from unique angles. If you're interested in adding some adventure to your Tampa visit, you can book this experience here: https://athometouch.com/tampa

Back to 7th Avenue - don't miss these highlights:
- Columbia Restaurant (Florida's oldest restaurant, established 1905)
- Centro Ybor (historic shopping and entertainment complex)
- Jose Marti Park (dedicated to Cuban independence)
- The many cigar shops and coffee houses
- Historic streetcar rides

The best time to visit is during special events like the Fiesta Day celebration or the weekly Saturday Market. The street gets especially lively during these times, with street performers, food vendors, and cultural demonstrations.

Pro tip: Park in one of the public garages just off 7th Avenue. Street parking can be challenging, especially during peak hours and weekends. Also, many of the historic buildings offer guided tours if you want to learn more about the architecture and history.

Whether you're a history buff, foodie, or just looking for a good time, 7th Avenue has something for everyone. It's more than just a street - it's a living museum of Tampa's multicultural heritage and a testament to the city's ongoing evolution.

Remember to bring comfortable walking shoes and a camera - there are plenty of Instagram-worthy spots along this historic stretch. And if you're up for more adventure after exploring the street, don't forget to check out that zipline experience I mentioned earlier.",1,1753326230.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

I had a really good time and I think she did too because we continued to meet almost on a daily basis after that.

Meetings for a quick coffee or a sandwich afternoon turned into hours of wandering the city together, enjoying the sites, laughing, having conversation.

I was finding myself thinking about her more and more and couldn't let a day go by without initiating some kind of contact and suggest that we meet. She always said yes and she even initated a meeting herslef a few times.

2 days ago we were sitting together in my hotel room, talking and listening to music. I felt that I couldn't just let the evening end without taking things forward.

So I gently put my hand on her shoulder while she was talking. She continued to talk as if not being aware of what just happened. I thought to myself, ok maybe you got your answer, just take your hand off and forget it ever happend. Thats what a normal person would do, but I just couldnt leave it at that, so I started playing with her hair very gently, just moving some of it from her face to behind her ear. She does have a long hair and it was all over. Ok, so this was something she could not ignore anymore. She stopped talking, looked at me and said: Did I give you somehow the wrong impression ? I was too far gone at this point so I answered: No, you gave the right impression. I like you. She didnt laugh (I thought it was a little bit funny) and looking at me she said: I like you too, but you know, in this platonic friendship which I thought we are having. I am not interested in anything romantic. I said that I understand and that i am sorry that I made her feel uncomfortable. 

Roll the tape forward 24 hours, we met again for a few hours, had a great time together and I am hopelessly in love with her.

I grew up very secular and for the past month or so I’ve been looking into Orthodoxy bc my husband had expressed interest in it. I bought my first bible and began reading it and would look up information on Orthodox Christianity and the differences between the different denominations. I was looking at it purely out of interest and wanting to understand it since my husband is passionate about it. I had never been drawn to investigating religion as I never experienced anything otherworldly, good or bad, and am the type of person who would need that kind of unexplainable experience to take that first step.

Almost two weeks ago on Friday, my husband and I eloped, and I suggested we visit a local Orthodox Church together the following Sunday (he has been alone previously and I now wanted to see what it was like after learning a bit more). We had a great weekend celebratory getaway and everything was great, after all, we just got married. However, on that Saturday night before church, I got sleep paralysis for the first time in my life. I saw an old woman leaning over me and was very close to my face. At first she was only smiling at me, but it was a very sinister smile and I felt pure fear. Then she started yelling at me and threatening me. I tried moving my hand to try and pat my husband awake since I couldn’t speak but of course, wasn’t able to. She then yelled “He isn’t going to help you, no one is ever going to save you.” At that point I closed my eyes and eventually went back to sleep. 

After liturgy and coffee hour (both were great btw) I remembered how scary the sleep paralysis was and looked it up seeing how I was unfamiliar with it/sleep paralysis demons. I guess what I saw was the old hag who is common in folklore around the world. And while I know what I experienced scientifically was sleep paralysis, I can’t find any explanation for why people around the world see this woman. I couldn’t find any biblical ties to her specifically or maybe I’m not being thorough enough. I also read something sources on spiritual warfare and how the devil will attack you out of fear of losing you. 

If I knew anything about sleep paralysis/spiritual warfare before this happened, I wouldn’t even have questioned why I saw and heard what I did. All I do know is that it felt genuinely evil and it happened while I was exploring the faith and right before I attended church willingly for the first time in my life. 

Since then I’ve continued to learn more about Orthodox Christianity and began praying and I haven’t experienced it since.

Zipper still half-open. Red thread still weaving in the teeth.
Tekel doesn’t want to go near it.
But he does.
He drops to one knee. The way he used to when he still prayed.
The zipper groans as he draws it back.

Inside: brown paper.
Soaked.
Tied with twine on the verge of snapping.

Third floor unit, extremely well lit, in-unit utilities, guaranteed storage space, shared (mostly free) parking spot. $1350 all-inclusive. First and security.

The room:

* Pretty big, Little bigger than 10’ x 12’. Big storage nook, full-width closet.
* Three windows, two eastish-facing, one southish-facing. *Really* good light (that pic doesn't do it justice).
* Included window AC.
* Good insulation, nice non-leaky windows, centrally located air vent; not a cold room.
* Only one con - tiles instead of wooden floor
   * Might not matter once you put down a bed and rug.

The roommate:

* Me, 36M, full-time employed, car-free
* Music/movie lover, cyclist, pool player, reader. I like cooking and mixing cocktails.
* Social person. I have guests over for brunch/dinner/movie night \~once a week.
* I don’t smoke tobacco. I sometimes smoke weed, always outside.
* No dietary restrictions. Fine with yours as long as we can share plates/cups/the fridge.

The house:

* Great location! Red line, green line, coffee, bike path, restaurants, bars, groceries, minutes walking. Tree-lined streets, slow traffic. Corner lot, garden, large, clean basement with storage space and shared workbench.
* Recently renovated unit. Central heat, pretty decent forced-air system. Dishwasher, washer, dryer in-unit and work fine. Sheetrock walls so you can actually hang things and have them stay on the wall.
* Great for cooking and entertaining. My kitchen tools are shared, and we can make room for yours too. Most of the cocktail gear/glassware is shared too.
* Common areas are furnished. Kind of specific decor, which might be a pro or con (I think it’s cute). Pretty bangin’ media setup in the living room, which you can use for your TV/gaming/music needs.
* Cat included! Very friendly, needy cat. A pro or con, depending.

The ask:

* I am a very tidy person (didn’t do special cleaning for these photos), looking for another tidy person.
   * Specifically this means: clear off surfaces when you’re done using them (an occasional laptop or book is fine).
   * Get dishes into the dishwasher within a few hours, wash pans within a few hours (soaking overnight is fine, soaking for 48 hours isn’t).
   * If you make a mess in any room, vacuum it within a day.
   * Be willing to split chores. I’m fine with a rotation or dedicated chores, as long as they get done.
* I have a few house rules.
   * Having guests over is great! But please keep overnight guests (like your partner) to twice a week.
   * Things in the kitchen go back where they came from. See the photo of the drawer for an example. Doesn’t have to be perfect but can’t be a pile. I wanna find that veggie peeler every time I need it.
   * No heated dry for the dishwasher cycle. It’s rough on the plates.
   * Please please please use a coaster. Water rings are so annoying to get out.
   * Be nice to my cat.

So, I drink a lot of decaf coffee, and the acidity can interfere with the absorption of Valcyclovir, or acyclovir, the main component of it. I found this information online. Now there is mixed data but Harvard and Apollo Health both say not a good idea. I definitely could tell even decaf stirred up my nerve pain.... Okay, I am pretty addicted to decaf coffee...

1m7synp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m7synp/relationship_anxiety_just_broke_up_the_best/,Relationship anxiety just broke up the best relationship I’ve ever had,"I fucked up so badly, that I broke up a relationship that has been everything I could ever hope for. Honest, communicative, loving, supportive, and truly amazing. 

I (M 31) was dating my partner (NBGF 28) for 2.5 months. We’d known each other for about 8 months prior. The first night we met was at a group meet up in my area, and being the nervous ball of anxiety I am, I saw them sitting alone and asked if I could join them. We talked together most of the night. I wanted to ask for their number right then and there. I didn’t, as I didn’t want to seem too pushy for being the first time we met. We would meet up at a karaoke night function with the same group and talk on occasion. I got so excited seeing them, and honestly started going more often because they would show up. They always came into the bar from the outside area to listen to me sing. About 8 months after that first night I finally worked up the courage to ask them on a date, and they said yes. A few weeks later we’d agreed to become partners. They went on a trip to Japan at one point and I missed them so terribly, and when they returned I ended up giving them a promise ring at our first dinner after they returned. They wore it everywhere. They were so happy with it and it was always a joy and comfort for me to feel it when we hugged or when I was sad and they would put my hand over their heart. 

My anxiety has always been an issue, and past relationships have never been very helpful in that regard. I’ve been cheated on multiple times, ghosted out of the blue, and am basically always ready for the other shoe to drop. For 2.5 months they put up with it, reassured me, listened to me, offered support. They finished their masters degree and have been seeking a job, which has been supremely stressful for them especially given that their family, whom they live with, has been on their ass about it and not understanding that the job market as a whole is not great, and that even for entry level jobs it’s not always as simple as walking in and handing in an application and resume, especially since most of those jobs won’t hire people with advanced degrees because they know they will leave when something better arises. 

My now ex-partner has been stressed to high hell, and they started taking birth control a little after we started dating, which I’m sure hasn’t helped with stress with the hormonal changes they can cause. I noticed a pull back in dates and coming over and sex. I voiced my concerns but reassured them that I would work through everything with them. I did request they come over and cuddle a bit more often like when we started dating. We’d talked before about getting a couples counselor just to make sure we were able to work through everything together and build a healthy relationship foundation. 

Wednesdays were our main date days, and yesterday (Tuesday) we’d ended up having a conversation because my anxiety flared when they didn’t say goodnight or good morning the way they typically did. The typical anxious “did I do something, are they mad at me, are they upset, is something wrong.” We ended with me asking if they were still coming over today (Wednesday) and they said yes. After the conversation and a couple hours of reflection, I sent them a long message apologizing and saying that I would get better control of my anxiety, and that I would give them space for the day to make up for it. 

Then I continued about my day, and went for a D&D game with friends. I got drunk. Wasted drunk. While drunk I thought about how I missed them coming over to cuddle and I wanted them to. So at 1am I called them. (Not so bad inherently right? It gets worse) i ended up calling them 4 times in 20 minutes and I remember leaving a voicemail practically begging them to come over. Then I got home and passed out. 

This morning instead of waking up to their smile and a coffee like usual, I woke up to “I’m done. I’m walking away. This relationship isn’t healthy for either of us. Don’t contact me again.” And I was floored, devastated, and shocked. I admit in that shock I reached out again, against my better judgement, asking to talk it over like we always do and for them to give me one more chance. I obviously never got a response, but they’ve also blocked me on everything. They are the avoidant type when they get overwhelmed, so while I was shocked, this is not fully surprising. 

A few hours later, the promise ring was on the front porch. 

I’m hoping without holding out that they will reach out in a few days to at least talk about it. If not, then I will drop off everything of theirs with a final letter of apology and well wishes with full intent to respect their request. I don’t know what will happen, and I know that the issues here are ones I need to address with a professional no matter what, and am seeking counseling to address it as an individual. 

I fucked up. I’ll admit it every day. If they do reach out, I hope that we can work through it and at the very least remain very good friends. 

TLDR/ I got drunk and anxiously blew up my partner’s phone at 1am because they hadn’t been over for cuddle time in a month and I was sad and missed them. They ghosted me after. ",1,1753325375.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1m7sy2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeKiwi/comments/1m7sy2t/the_price_of_everything_the_value_of_nothing/,"The price of everything, the value of nothing","I posted this in TOS on yet another thread about the price of dairy. It's hasn't been downvoted to oblivion yet, but it's still early. 

As I've been reading in a lot of threads both here and on TOS there’s a recurring theme and it's the obsession with price over any talk about value.

It’s always “how can I get this cheaper”, ""this is a rip off”, “I haggled the hell out of them”, “why is X cheaper in Australia”.

But we almost never ask ""why don’t we invest in making things better instead of just cheaper"" or ""what’s the actual cost of driving every supplier, tradie, or business down to their margin floor"".

Yes, there are absolutely players out there who gouge and they should rightfully be called on it and forced to do better. But that doesn’t explain everything. Not every high price is profiteering. Sometimes it’s just the actual cost of doing business in a low scale, geographically isolated country.

This price mindset though seems to trickle through everything. We demand cheap butter but don’t want to hear about the global market cost of milk solids or freight. We expect tradies to be fast, skilled, and available immediately but god forbid they charge more than $60 an hour. We’ll moan about a $6 coffee from a cafe paying living wages, then drop $90 on yoga pants made in a sweatshop.

When we do talk about wages, it’s usually through the lens of entitlement or blame. “Bosses are greedy” or “the minimum wage is too low”. We treat it as a moral issue (which it is, in part), but almost never in the context of how to lift the value of the work being done. There’s little conversation about improving productivity, investing in skills, creating higher value jobs, or supporting industries that do more than just resell stuff made somewhere else.

Right now we’re stuck in this loop where everything is too expensive, wages are too low, and any attempt to fix one gets torpedoed by the other while trying to find someone else to blame. If we want a higher wage economy (which is actually the real issue here), we need to stop fixating on cutting prices and start building value.

But that’s not going to happen while everyones pushing prices to the floor. You can’t expect better wages, better service, or better products in an economy where the default instinct is to squeeze every dollar out of the other guy. If the national psyche is built on ""cheapest wins"" then there’s no margin left to invest in people. No incentive to train, to innovate, or to pay fairly. It's a race to the bottom and we’re all hitting it together.

And no, government intervention isn’t the magic answer. You can’t regulate your way to a high value economy. You can’t subsidise your way to prosperity. At best, government can grease the wheels by improving infrastructure, support skills training, or level the playing field in concentrated markets. But it can’t force people to invest, innovate, or shift their mindset about price versus value. That has to come from the ground up.

And before someone jumps in with “but we just exports commodities” no, we don’t. Not in the way people think. Our dairy, meat, wine, etc are positioned as premium goods in their global markets. Fonterra isn’t selling bulk milk powder as a cheap filler. Our beef and lamb aren’t going into low end pet food. NZ wine isn’t a bargain bin product in the UK. We’ve spent decades building a reputation for clean, traceable, sustainable, high quality exports and we charge a premium for that. The problem isn’t that we’re commodity producers. It’s that we treat ourselves like we deserve commodity prices at home, while demanding first world wages, infrastructure, and services. That contradiction between what we want to pay and what we expect in return is a big part of the whole mess.",6,1753325325.0,ConservativeKiwi,11,0.8,False

Tired of endless swiping and surface-level chats? Me too. I’m here hoping to find something real—a genuine connection with someone who’s as excited about life as I am.

Imagine this: spontaneous road trips with the windows down, deep conversations over coffee that last until sunrise, and laughter so contagious it leaves us both breathless. If you’re passionate about making the most of every moment and believe that life is better when shared, we might just be on the same wavelength.

A bit about me:
I’m an honest, straightforward guy with a healthy dose of curiosity and a knack for adventure. Average height, brown hair, and someone who loves staying active—whether it’s hitting the gym, hiking a new trail, or diving into a friendly game (sports or video!). I’m financially secure and believe in giving back, always ready to lend a hand or brighten someone’s day.

If you’re an animal lover, you’ll have to forgive me for stopping to greet every dog or cat we meet—bonus points if you do the same! 🐾

What I’m looking for:
Someone who values authenticity, open communication, and a relationship built on mutual respect. I believe the best connections are rooted in honesty, effort, and a willingness to truly listen. If you’re ready for meaningful conversations, shared adventures, and a partnership where both people show up, I’d love to get to know you.

If you’re only here for fleeting chats or aren’t ready for genuine connection, that’s totally okay—just not what I’m after. But if you’re ready to build something real, let’s see where this journey takes us. Swipe right on life, and let’s create our own story! ",1,1753325238.0,NerdDating,0,1.0,False

Tired of endless swiping and surface-level chats? Me too. I’m here hoping to find something real—a genuine connection with someone who’s as excited about life as I am.

Imagine this: spontaneous road trips with the windows down, deep conversations over coffee that last until sunrise, and laughter so contagious it leaves us both breathless. If you’re passionate about making the most of every moment and believe that life is better when shared, we might just be on the same wavelength.

A bit about me:
I’m an honest, straightforward guy with a healthy dose of curiosity and a knack for adventure. Average height, brown hair, and someone who loves staying active—whether it’s hitting the gym, hiking a new trail, or diving into a friendly game (sports or video!). I’m financially secure and believe in giving back, always ready to lend a hand or brighten someone’s day.

If you’re an animal lover, you’ll have to forgive me for stopping to greet every dog or cat we meet—bonus points if you do the same! 🐾

What I’m looking for:
Someone who values authenticity, open communication, and a relationship built on mutual respect. I believe the best connections are rooted in honesty, effort, and a willingness to truly listen. If you’re ready for meaningful conversations, shared adventures, and a partnership where both people show up, I’d love to get to know you.

If you’re only here for fleeting chats or aren’t ready for genuine connection, that’s totally okay—just not what I’m after. But if you’re ready to build something real, let’s see where this journey takes us. Swipe right on life, and let’s create our own story! ",1,1753325116.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I’m 32, from New York, and I guess you could say I’m a bit of a contradiction — in the best way. I’m a country-leaning, blue-collar guy with a soft heart and an artsy eye. I’m just as at home behind a camera lens catching golden hour light as I am watching a race or yelling at the refs during a hockey game.

I’ve got a beard, long hair, and a bigger build — the kind of guy you might spot holding a coffee in one hand and a guitar or camera in the other. Music means a lot to me. So does the roar of engines, the quiet of a Sunday morning, and the feeling you get when someone truly sees you.

I’m looking for someone between 25 and 40, but beyond that? I’m open. Whether it turns into love or just a great conversation, I’m good with seeing where the road leads. No pressure, no games. Just genuine connection.

I’m not putting all my cards on the table here, but I’m happy to talk about anything you’d like to know. If you’re the kind of woman who values heart, humor, and a little bit of grit — I’d love to hear from you.

We were 19, sitting outside having coffee one morning, and I started telling her about a random dream I had the night before. In the dream, we were throwing a party at our parents house. A bunch of our friends were there, and out of nowhere, a huge fight broke out. The part that stood out most AND was the most random part? One of our friends grabbed a white lounge chair and hurled it up into a tree. I remember freaking out in the dream, yelling that our parents were going to be pissed and demanding someone get the chair down.

As I’m describing all this, my sister just stares at me and was like, “Wait… I had the exact same dream….” She recalled the party, the fight, and the white lounge chair being thrown into the tree, by the same person I saw in my dream. She even remembered me yelling about it just like I did.

We weren’t talking about anything like this before bed, and nothing remotely similar had happened in real life except for the fact we would have that group of people over our parents house a lot to hang or party. It still creeps us out in the best way.

So now I’m curious, are there other twins out there who’ve had shared dreams like this? Was it random, or do you think it’s something deeper? I want to hear your stories ",2,1753324933.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False
1m7st1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m7st1h/what_is_the_best_oahu_island_tour/,What is the best Oahu island tour?,"After exploring nearly every tour option on Oahu, I can confidently say the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall stands out as the most comprehensive way to experience the island in a single day.

I initially hesitated about booking an organized tour, preferring to explore independently. However, this decision turned out to be one of the best I made during my Hawaiian vacation. The tour perfectly balances major attractions with hidden gems that most tourists miss.

The journey begins with an early morning pickup in Waikiki, which I appreciated because it helps beat the crowds. Our first stop at Diamond Head offered breathtaking coastal views - perfect for those sunrise photos. The morning light hitting the ocean created some incredible photo opportunities.

What really impressed me was our guide's knowledge of Hawaiian history and culture. Unlike some tours that just drive by locations, we got fascinating stories about each spot. At Nu'uanu Pali Lookout, we learned about King Kamehameha's historic battle while enjoying spectacular views of the Windward Coast.

The North Shore portion of the tour was a highlight. We stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and had time to grab lunch at the legendary shrimp trucks. Pro tip: Giovanni's Shrimp Truck is worth the wait, but bring cash.

Waimea Valley was arguably the tour's centerpiece. The botanical garden walk to the waterfall is stunning, and yes, you can actually swim there! Just remember to pack your swimsuit and a quick-dry towel. The water was refreshing, and the whole experience felt magical.

One unexpected highlight was the stop at Tropical Farms. The Kona coffee tasting was excellent, and I ended up bringing home some macadamia nuts that were far better (and cheaper) than what you'll find in Waikiki shops.

If you're considering booking this tour (which I highly recommend), you can reserve your spot here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, so there's no risk in securing your spot early.

A few practical tips:
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring a water bottle
- Pack both sunscreen and a light rain jacket
- Don't forget your camera
- Bring cash for lunch and souvenirs

The tour costs $154 per person, which initially might seem steep. However, when you factor in individual entrance fees, transportation costs, and the convenience of having everything organized, it's actually quite reasonable.

The 8-hour duration is perfect - long enough to see everything without feeling rushed, but not so long that you're exhausted. The air-conditioned vehicle between stops was always a welcome relief from the Hawaiian sun.

After trying several island tours, this one offers the best balance of sightseeing, cultural insights, and activities. It's particularly great for first-time visitors who want to see the whole island without the hassle of renting a car or planning a route.

In conclusion, if you're looking to maximize your time on Oahu and want to see the island's highlights in one well-organized day, this tour is your best bet. Just remember to book in advance as spots fill up quickly, especially during peak season.",1,1753324905.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

I had been seeing the posts go around of this Hoohill Pico in the Wes Anderson color scheme so I decided to get one. Normally I don’t buy knockoff pens but I love the color scheme and would never pay the Montblanc markup for it. 

The pen has a nice feel to it. It’s a slip cap pen but has a screw to post system that is pretty neat. I knew from the start that I wanted to put a vintage nib on the pen as a got a stockpile from restoring pens. I found an Eversharp Skyline nib fits with no trimming of the feed necessary. The one I used is a flex nib so I widened the ink channel on the feed to supply plenty of ink. I then heat set the feed to the nib. It’s a plastic feed (meaning it’s water safe) so I boiled some water in a coffee mug in the microwave. Then I held it in the water for about 20 seconds, pulled it out, and bent it slightly upwards to fit the nib snugly. It may sound like a lot but it’s not too bad once you get the hang of it.

All in all it turned out great and I think the pen will stay in my collection. It’s going right next to the vintage Kaweco Sport and other small pocket pens I have.

What do you all think? Does this pen justify a vintage nib? Does this knockoff make you mad or do you want one now? Was my doodle good? 😂 ",11,1753324542.0,fountainpens,4,1.0,False

1m7so0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AyeshaErotica/comments/1m7so0p/horny4u_how_i_would_do_it/,HORNY.4U: How I Would Do It,"We all know the whole H.4U remaster was... weird. The delays, the scattered singles that missed cohesion, and the fact that the album wasn’t even made yet, it just all felt off.

In my opinion, the project lacked direction from Ayesha herself. She seemed torn between her classic sound and her new style, between giving fans what they wanted and pursuing her own artistic vision. But I believe there’s a way to balance both worlds.

Here’s how I would approach H.4U if I were Ayesha:

**The Core Issue: Style Clash**

The biggest problem with the remaster was the awkward blend of old and new tracks. The two styles just don’t mesh, they clash instead of complementing each other. That’s why I think Ayesha have three options:

**1. Scrap the new songs and just release the old demos.**

**2. Turn H.4U into a fully new project.**

**3. Or the best idea in my opinion: make it a double album/project.**

Think SOS and LANA by SZA: two distinct but connected parts. One would focus on the old material, and the second would give space to her newer sound.

Now let’s talk about the actual remastering process:

***For old known songs like Vacation Bible School:***
I’d remaster them lightly, not remake them beyond recognition. Just polish up the instrumental and vocals with a blend of old and new Ayesha flair. Hot Dog Hooker is a perfect example of how this can work.

***For old unknown songs like Anna Nicole:***
They’d need to be recorded, of course. The beat should also reflect the fusion of styles, something fresh, but still rooted in the original vibe.

***For old unfinished songs like From the Back:***
Again, finish them up with the same approach, a mix of the classic and the current sound, blah blah blah.

***For the new tracks:***
You know the drill by now, right?

In the end, everything should reflect a blend, bridging the gap between Ayesha's past and present. The goal is to create something authentic that doesn’t water down the essence of the original H.4U concept.

Now let's get to the tracklist..


#***HORNY.4U: ACT I (the old songs)***



**1. h.4u theme**

**2. iconic**

**3. we can do it!**

**4. vacation bible school**

**5. anna nicole**

**6. cum c my tits**

**7. anal queen**

**8. star**

**9. from the back**

**10. alice**

**11. all around the world**

**12. how great is our god?**

#***HORNY.4U: ACT II (the new songs)***



**1. condom (prod. mkx)**

**2. all-star anal weekend**

**3. i wanna fuck**

**4. friday**

**5. darla**

**6. hot dog hooker**

**7. coffee cake**

**8. handjob (ft. baku)**

**9. superpuss**

**10. hands on me**

**11. house party**

**12. get down on you**
