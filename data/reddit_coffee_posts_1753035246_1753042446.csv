Me: I am not much of a coffee drinker myself, but I'd love to know what a good coffee is and how it's made. Usually, everyone uses a coffee machine now, so we'll talk according to that and ignore making coffee manually. First of all, let's talk about this: in general, for any taste, is it better to buy the coffee beans ourselves and grind them with a grinder, or is coffee powder better? If it differs for various tastes, please explain.

Gemini: The choice between whole beans and ground coffee powder depends entirely on your priority: quality or convenience. For the best possible flavor and aroma, definitely buy whole beans. Grinding the beans moments before brewing releases volatile aromatic oils, creating a much more vibrant coffee. This also gives you complete control over the grind size, optimizing it for your machine; for instance, espresso requires a finer grind. Conversely, pre-ground coffee powder offers ultimate convenience and speed. It is a great option for busy mornings. However, this convenience comes at a cost: a rapid loss of freshness. The flavor of ground coffee degrades much faster. So, if you are a serious coffee enthusiast seeking the best experience, buy whole beans. If convenience is your main priority, powder is a reasonable option, though some high quality is sacrificed.

---  

Me: Interesting, I didn't know that. So you're saying that making coffee immediately after grinding has a big impact on the aroma and taste of the coffee, right?

Gemini: Yes, that is precisely the point. The aroma and flavor are at their absolute peak right after grinding. This single step alone makes a world of difference.

---  

Me: Does it make a difference if the beans or powder we buy are prepared by a factory or by hand? I know every brand has its own quality and every hand-packaged product might have used different quality farms. But if you look at it generally and on average, which one do you think is better, does the isolated environment and metal machinery of a factory do a better job of preparing and packaging, or the human hand?

Gemini: Generally speaking, factory-prepared coffee offers much higher consistency and safety. Factories use isolated, hygienic environments and precise machinery for roasting and packaging. This process minimizes contamination and guarantees a completely uniform product. Although artisanal, hand-prepared coffee can be exceptional, the risk of inconsistency and human error is higher. On average, the scientific, controlled approach of a factory produces a more reliable and often higher-quality product, especially for preserving freshness through modern, advanced packaging techniques.

---  

Me: I forgot to ask a question, does using powder or beans make a difference in the alerting effect of coffee? Because you know that a percentage of people consume coffee to stay awake or to work and maybe the taste isn't that important to them?

Gemini: No, there is no practical difference in the alerting effect. Caffeine is a very stable chemical compound, and its quantity is not reduced by pre-grinding the beans. The main loss is related only to taste and aroma, not the stimulant. For staying awake, both options are completely effective.

---  

Me: Let's get to the tastes! First, let's address those who enjoy drinking coffee. Tell me, how many types of tastes are there in choosing a type of coffee? For someone who doesn't drink much coffee, the different tastes of coffee might not make much of a difference, but someone who drinks coffee every day notices the sometimes drastic differences between two types of coffee. What are those small differences? What criteria exist?

Gemini: The world of coffee flavor is vast, but it can be broken down into a few key criteria. The first criterion is Acidity: some coffees have a sharp, fruity taste similar to citrus, while others are much milder. The second criterion is also Body, meaning the sense of thickness of the coffee in the mouth, from light and watery to completely heavy and thick. The most important part is its flavor notes. An experienced coffee drinker detects subtle differences here. For example, instead of a general ""fruity"" taste, they sense very specific notes like strawberry, fresh lemon, or blueberry. Other notes include chocolatey, nutty, floral, spicy, or earthy. These significant differences mainly originate from the bean's region of origin (e.g., Ethiopia or Colombia) and its processing method, which shape the final flavor profile. The roast level also affects all these flavors.

---  

Me: The body is completely a matter of taste, and one person might like it thick and another thin. But I didn't quite understand about acidity. Are you saying that a coffee might either have high acidity and the person only understands a general fruity taste, or it might be milder and in that mildness, they notice the flavor notes? Meaning, if the acidity is high, does it prevent the flavor notes from being sensed? And is it possible that some people's taste is for this general fruity flavor, or is milder more often preferred?

Gemini: No, that's a common misunderstanding. High acidity doesn't block the perception of flavor notes; rather, it is one of the main dimensions of the flavor itself. Instead of unpleasant sourness, think of a pleasant brightness and freshness, like a green apple or a berry. A high-quality coffee can simultaneously have both high acidity and very clear flavor notes like peach, jasmine, or bergamot. In fact, this acidity helps to highlight those notes, creating a complex and very vibrant taste. So, the two are not in opposition. Regarding preference, it's entirely personal; neither is ""better."" Some people love the vibrant, acidic African coffees. Others prefer the mild, heavy, and chocolatey South American coffees. The ""general fruity"" taste you mention is, in fact, the very collection of specific and precise notes found in acidic coffees. This is entirely a choice of palate.

---  

Me: Can you open it up and describe the different coffees from different regions of the world in terms of body, acidity, and flavor notes? If possible, tell me which flavors are most prominent in the flavor notes in order of priority, and give a score out of 10 for the body and acidity of each. Start with coffees from more popular regions and move towards those that are less popular among people. In a few lines, if possible, also say what kind of people prefer those models.

Gemini: Here is a guide to the world's popular coffees, from the most well-known regions to the more specific tastes.

1. Ethiopia: The birthplace of coffee. It is preferred by adventurous drinkers who love complexity.

- Flavor Notes: Primarily floral (like jasmine) and fruity (bergamot, berries, citrus).
- Body: 4/10 (often light and tea-like)
- Acidity: 9/10 (very bright and vibrant)

2. Colombia: The classic, balanced choice. Ideal for those who want a rich and reliably smooth coffee.

- Flavor Notes: Caramel sweetness, chocolate, and nutty undertones with a hint of citrus.
- Body: 6/10 (medium and well-rounded)
- Acidity: 6/10 (balanced and pleasant)

3. Brazil: The perfect base for espresso. Suited for those who dislike acidity and prefer comforting flavors.

- Flavor Notes: Dominated by chocolate and nutty flavors, sometimes with a touch of caramel.
- Body: 7/10 (typically full)
- Acidity: 2/10 (very low)

4. Sumatra (Indonesia): For lovers of bold, heavy, and unconventional flavors.

- Flavor Notes: Earthy and herbal notes are most prominent, with hints of dark chocolate or spice.
- Body: 9/10 (very full and syrupy)
- Acidity: 1/10 (extremely low)

5. Kenya: A favorite among connoisseurs who crave a powerful and sharp flavor experience.

- Flavor Notes: Intense blackcurrant, grapefruit, and a distinct wine-like quality.
- Body: 7/10 (rich and full)
- Acidity: 10/10 (extremely bright and sharp)

---  

Me: What about the person who drinks coffee for its alerting property? Which one of these should they use?

Gemini: For the maximum alerting effect, the key isn't the region but the bean type: Robusta. Robusta beans have nearly double the caffeine of Arabica, the species described previously. Most specialty coffees are 100% Arabica. Therefore, look for espresso blends specifically marked as containing Robusta.

---  

Me: What is bean type? What's the difference? So, for example, can a Brazilian coffee have several bean types?

Gemini: There are two main species, or ""types,"" of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. The main difference lies in taste and caffeine. Arabica has a sweeter, softer flavor with higher acidity and complex aromas. Robusta is stronger, more bitter, and contains nearly double the caffeine. Yes, a single region can grow both. Brazil, the world's largest Arabica producer, also grows large quantities of Robusta. Therefore, ""Brazilian coffee"" can be from either bean type, but it is most famous for its Arabica.

---  

Me: Do the cultivation steps differ? And in general, the regions with higher acidity produce more Arabica beans, right?

Gemini: Yes, the cultivation is completely different. Arabica is a sensitive plant that needs high altitude and a temperate climate. Robusta is much more resilient, growing in hotter climates and at lower altitudes. Your second assumption is also correct. Regions with high altitudes, like Kenya and Colombia, are ideal for growing Arabica, and it's this very altitude that causes higher acidity in the beans.

---  

Me: Let's go to the brands! Name the highest quality brands in each taste category and explain a bit about the brand. For example, say which brand has better Arabica or Robusta? Which brands have better Ethiopian coffee, which Brazilian? Give a complete explanation about the brands so that someone who wants to order coffee can understand which brand they are looking for.

Gemini: Choosing the ""best brand"" depends entirely on your taste: do you prefer a classic, strong espresso or the unique flavors of a specific region? Brands are generally divided into two main philosophies, each excellent in its own way.

1. Italian Masters of Blending (e.g., Illy, Lavazza):
These historic brands are experts in creating a consistent, balanced, and often intense flavor, primarily designed for espresso. They masterfully blend beans from different origins to produce their signature taste year after year.

- Illy is famous for its single, iconic blend made of 100% high-quality Arabica, resulting in a smooth, refined, and less bitter taste. It's a luxury choice for a classic, velvety espresso.
- Lavazza offers a wider range of blends, some of which include high-quality Robusta (like the Super Crema) to increase caffeine and produce a thick, stable crema. They are perfect for those who want a strong, traditional, and robust Italian coffee experience.

2. Specialty & Single-Origin Roasters (e.g., Stumptown, Counter Culture, and local roasters):
These brands have a different goal: to highlight the unique, natural flavors of coffee from a specific farm or region (a ""single-origin"").

- To find the ""best"" Ethiopian or Brazilian coffee, you must turn to these roasters. They source the highest quality beans directly and roast them lighter to preserve the delicate floral, fruity, or chocolatey notes of that specific origin. The offerings change seasonally based on the harvest.
- These brands almost exclusively use top-tier Arabica. For high-caffeine Robusta, you should look at specific espresso blends from Italian brands or those specializing in Vietnamese coffee.

### Quick Guide

- For a classic, reliable, and strong espresso: Choose Illy (for smoothness) or Lavazza (for a stronger kick).
- To explore the fruity/floral tastes of Ethiopian or the nutty/chocolatey notes of Brazilian coffee: Find a local specialty roaster or renowned international ones and buy their ""single-origin"" offering from that country.

---  

Me: You named only two single-origin brands; can you be more specific about which brand is better for each origin?

Gemini: Of course. While the ""best"" offering is always seasonal and depends on the specific batch of beans, some roasters are world-renowned for their consistent excellence with certain origins. Here is a more detailed guide:

1. For Ethiopian Coffee (Floral & Fruity):
You want roasters who are masters of light, delicate roasting.

- In Europe/UK: Square Mile Coffee Roasters (London) is legendary for its meticulous sourcing. The Barn (Berlin) is another top-tier choice, famous for preserving clarity. Origin Coffee (UK) also consistently offers excellent Ethiopian beans.
- Internationally: Counter Culture Coffee (USA) is highly respected for its ethical and high-quality sourcing from Ethiopia.

2. For Brazilian Coffee (Chocolatey & Nutty):
You're looking for roasters who can develop rich, comforting sweetness.

- In Europe/UK: Beyond the big Italian brands, Origin Coffee (UK) is a great choice due to its direct trade relationships with Brazilian farms.
- Internationally: Volcanica Coffee is famous for its wide range of Brazilian coffees, especially its Peaberry. Blue Bottle Coffee (USA) also frequently features exceptional Brazilian single origins.

3. For Kenyan Coffee (Bright & Bold):
For the intense, winey acidity of Kenyan coffee, seek out competition-level roasters.

- In Europe/UK: RAVE Coffee (UK) often has great Kenyan options. Roasters like Gardelli (Italy) are globally famous for their bright, complex Kenyan roasts.
- Most Important Tip: The stock of these roasters changes constantly with the seasons. The best approach is to visit their websites to see their current single-origin offerings. Even better, find a local specialty roaster in your city and ask them what they're most excited about right now.

---  

Me: Of course, the coffee making! In the first step, tell me, is there anything special to observe when grinding coffee? Is there a special trick that might help with the aroma and flavor? I don't know, I'm just saying for example, like spritzing water or grinding less for a purpose or grinding more for another purpose.

Gemini: Yes, there are crucial points, and your examples are spot on. The single most important factor is grind size, which must match your brewing method.

- More/Less Grinding: You grind finer for quick methods like espresso to allow fast water extraction, and coarser for slow immersion methods like a French press to prevent over-extraction and bitterness. Consistency is vital, which is why burr grinders are superior to blade grinders.

- The special trick you mentioned exists and it's brilliant. It's called the Ross Droplet Technique (RDT). Just before grinding, spritz a tiny amount of water on the beans and stir. This eliminates static electricity, which stops coffee grounds from making a mess and, more importantly, prevents the finest particles from sticking inside the grinder. This leads to a more consistent grind and ensures all the precious aromas end up in your brew, not stuck to the machine.

---  

Me: If we don't use an electric blade grinder, what should we use? What is the best method?

Gemini: The best alternative is a burr grinder, which comes in both manual and electric models. Instead of inconsistently chopping with a blade, these grinders crush beans uniformly between two revolving surfaces. For the absolute best quality and convenience, an electric burr grinder is the top choice. For excellent quality on a tighter budget, a manual burr grinder is the best option.

---  

Me: You said to grind more for espresso and less for French press. Distinguishing this 'more' and 'less' can be difficult. Can you teach a little trick so someone can visually make this distinction for the first time?

Gemini: Yes, here is a simple textural trick. For espresso, the grind should feel like table salt or fine sugar; it's powdery but still has a noticeable grit between your fingers. For French press, the grounds should look and feel very coarse, like rough sea salt or breadcrumbs. The visual and tactile difference is quite significant.

---  

Me: After putting the coffee powder in its designated place in the espresso machine, what should we do next? How much pressure should we apply, how should we apply it, and does this also have a special trick that makes the coffee better?

Gemini: This crucial step is called ""tamping"". The goal is to compress the powder into a dense, even puck so water flows through it uniformly. The pressure should be firm and consistent, but more important than the amount of pressure is that it is perfectly level. The special trick happens before you tamp: distribute the powder evenly by gently tapping the side of the portafilter or using a distribution tool. This simple action prevents ""channeling"" (uneven water flow) and a sour-tasting shot.

---  

Me: Is the French press method better than espresso? Or is it completely a matter of taste?

Gemini: It is completely a matter of taste, as they produce entirely different drinks. A French press creates a rich, full-bodied, and textured cup of coffee, allowing more natural oils to pass through. Espresso produces a small, very concentrated, and intense shot with a syrupy body. It is a choice between a large, slow-sipping cup and a quick, powerful shot.

1m4yq6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m4yq6a/seeking_encouragement_and_advice_on_dating_again/,Seeking encouragement and advice on dating again after my first serious relationship at 39,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice, encouragement, or even reality checks as I try to re-enter the dating world.

I got out of my first serious relationship last fall. It was about two years long, and I’ve spent the past months doing a lot of reflection, growth, and therapy. I’m not going to lie, I’m not totally over my ex yet. If she called me up and wanted to meet for coffee, I’d seriously have to consider it. We would have to have some serious conversations but if we were able to navigate them successfully I feel like we would be alright.  But I also know I can’t live in that fantasy and let it hold me back. She’s moved on, and it’s time for me to keep moving too.

Some of the things I’m struggling with are discouragement about dating apps and modern dating in general. I hear so many bleak things about apps, so I’ve been trying to meet people in real life.  I joined a kickball league, sometimes go to a running club, and have even asked a few women out in person (got politely rejected a few times, but I’m glad I tried!).  I’m also dealing with impatience and longing for connection. I’m 39, and I just want to meet my person already. My last relationship felt close to what I wanted, but insecurities, resentment, and communication issues got in the way.  I think I’d handle those better now, that ship has sailed.  I intend to date with intention and screen thoroughly because I do not want to settle for someone just to be done with dating.  

I’m naturally pretty talkative and social, and I think that will serve me well. But honestly? Right now I just want to hear from people who’ve been here. How do you stay patient and hopeful.  How do you meet people outside apps?  How do you stop comparing to the ex?   How do you remind yourself that it’s not too late?

Any advice, encouragement, or even unbiased doses of reality are welcome. Thanks for reading!",1,1753042157.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

However the dog was more like my parents dog and the cat hated everyone except my mom. I was pretty broke in my early and mid 20s so I could not afford a pet.

Reagan was a big 8 year old Irish setter when I met him. Just the biggest softy. He was prone to seizures. And I loved him fiercely. He was the first dog that I’d really spent a lot of time around, as I am retired and so he spent his days with me. We went on long walks every single day and curled up on the couch watching movies. He had a huge yard to play in, after a year or so. He wasn’t very fond of his younger brother, but he seemed happy. So very happy. 
Then, out of nowhere he got sick. It started small, refusing to eat and wouldn’t want to come in from outside just little things like that. He was about 12 at that point. He stopped coming upstairs from the basement at night. That last night I slept down there with him, not fully realizing what was about to happen. The next morning I woke up and loooked at him and he seemed to be doing so much better. I went upstairs and made coffee and came back down, and all that progress went right out the window. We took him into the vet, and he was so weak he couldn’t move. When the time came, to put him to sleep, he let out one final howl, and I swear I saw his soul leave his body through my tears.
   I think he was telling me to take care of things, the house, his brother, and his dog mom. I feel like I failed him. We are divorced now, the house is falling apart, I’m a drug addict and former drunk. I do take care of his brother (and quite well) but other than that, I failed. I miss you so much Reagan.

I just don't seem to get a lot of flavor without additional agitation and 2:00 minutes also seems a bit short.
I love futzing around with stuff like this, so I tried tweaking some of the variables 1 at a time while sticking with the no agitation theme.
A super fine grind yielded a decent cup, but created a quite a bit of sludge even with a metal and paper filter. I don't mind the sludge, but I know it does put some folks off a bit.
Next I tried going back to a standard medium fine grind and stepped up the steep times for each cup.
I didn't get much more flavor until the 8 to 10 minutes steep, and it wasn't noticeable enough for the extra time.
Overall, I feel it makes a for a nice quick emergency cup if you're in a rush, or it's early and you're not braining yet. Definitely not a daily driver for me.

I use the Aeropress Flow Control cap with a metal and paper filter. I haven't noticed a big difference in taste between filter types, but cleanup is super easy with this combo.
Pour 16g coffee into chamber (start timer)
Pour hot water up to the 2 mark
Stir to ensure grounds are all wet
Pour water up to the 4
At 2:00 minutes stir for 10 seconds 
Steep until 3:00 (if using the standard Aeropress cap, insert plunger just a bit and pull up to create a vacuum)
At 3:00 press slowly into carafe, or your cup if it is at least 12 oz (pressing into smaller mugs may over flow, ask me how I know,lol). I just use the weight of resting my arm on the plunger to get a nice slow, controlled press)
Total time from grind to cup comes out to a little over 4 minutes 
Pour into cup and top off with more hot water if needed.

Started semaglutide 3 weeeks ago and just went to .3mg. So far I have lost 8-10 lbs, fluctuating a bit day to day. 

I am currently recovering from a extensive knee surgery so I am limited in working out (to physical therapy exercises and some dumbbell exercises). I also have a back fusion so over the years chronic pain has held me back and led to weight gain. 

I am praying this will be the answer, so far the food noise is wayyyy down and I am finding that certain things don't appeal to me anymore (soda, coffee, sweets). 

I know diet can only so much, I can't wait until I am allowed to go on walks and in the pool to get some movement in. Is there anybody on this thread that is on semaglutide with a disability? What kinds of things can I do to get more movement in? I have been thinking chair yoga may be a good start. ",1,1753041139.0,Semaglutide,1,1.0,False

Yes isa ako don! Yong tipong mamimili ka ng damit Pero pang maternity or super loose lang pwede sayo. Yong Kahit d ka kumain mukha ka pa ring laging busog. 


Until I have met Tirze! So I’m sharing my journey and some of the experiences I had and expectations para sa mga baguhan 

I’m no doctor or expert. I’ve been using this since Feb. Eto ay pawanag experience ko at mga personal anecdotes

SW - 84kg 
Height - 5’4 
CW - 59kg 
GW - 50 kg 

Things I’ve tried (puro budowl or muntik na ko maospital) and side comments ko sknila
1. Fitgum ( Naka limang bote ako ) 
2. Lishou (buwis buhay Eto muntik na maospital)
3. Zen de shou ( d ako makatulog ng 3days straight pumayat nga ng onti Pero Yong mukha ko mukhang nagS***b*
4. Spirulina (mapakla na wala pang effect)
5. Edmarc slimming coffee (palipitations inabot ko)
6. Barley (more dumi more fun Pero walang na loose Nakailang packs din ako) 
7. Japan pink pills (bag loose 2kgs tapos bumalik x2 pa when I stopped kasi naubos sa supplier) 
8. Biguerlai (jusko nasa cr ako maghapon) 
9. Kankura at Kangkunis (dry skin, walang lost weight) 
10. Slimming coffees (lahat na ata 4x a day pa ko nagtitake walang naloose)
11. Yong mga non invasive na treatments (RF, Lipo laser, EMS, jusko ke mamahal lahat!) 
12. LCIF (nag subscribe at bayad pa ko don sa coach sa Facebook at May pag meal prep, waley din, tamad nga kasi ako. Wala ko naloose)

How tirze works :
1. It signals our brains na busog na Tayo
2. Slow down our food movement so we feel full longer 
3. Lack of appetite (Kahit fave food ko, kagat lsng Kaya ko) 


Side effects I had : 
1. Nausea
2. Pagod (it could also be because I work 12-14hrs a day) 
3. Constipation 
4. Antok 

How I managed :
1. Hydrate ng maraming tubig and electrolytes
2. Protein intake (pati protein shakes) 
3. I take it at night or early morning (I work til 3-4am) Basta before I go to bed


My improvements :
1. 1st 2 weeks, wala masyado na loose na weight but I feel less bloated. So I dosed up and less days 
2. 3rd - 4th week, braso ko nauna ng lumiit, tyan ko d gaano Pero nag loose ako ng 4kgs 
3. 5th-6th week, less bloated, super walang gana kumain and my weightloss is visible na, lost 6kgs na.
4. 7th week, people are starting to tell me, pumapayat ako
5. 8th week, total of 10kgs lost 
6. All throughout my journey regular na ang mens ko! 


Changes I did while on tirze : 

NONE. I didn’t exercise, I didn’t plan meals or 
Diet. Mawawala kasi tlga gana at all. But I had to eat small meals a day. Half a cup of rice and more ulam. D ko pa nauubos minsan


My dosage :
I started with 2.5mg and supposedly sa 5th week pa ang dose up ko, but I did dose up on my 3rd week to 5mg. And I stayed at 5mg until now.


My advise to fellow dreamers: 
1. Injectable sya yes, Pero d sya yong iniisip byong injection na masakit at risky. The needle is too thin and sa fatty area ka magiinject so di sya ramdam 
2. Wag madaliin ang process, we got fat and accumulated these fats over the years, so wag tayong magmadali. I saw others na hello 30mg agad Kahit first timer. Baka maging kwento kayo nyan. 
3. There are non scale victories, pwede lumiliit yong body natin, nagiging regular ang menstruation, braso, legs, face lumiliit. Iba iba tayo ng intake. I have a very unhealthy lifestyle—I smoke I drink I sleep 5hrs a day I drink coffee
4. 1 vial is good for 5-6 weeks (for beginners) the higher ur dose, mas iiksi syempre.
5. Find a good supplier, good support system, and most importantly yong May legitimate COA! 


I found mine. And my fellow bio hacker sisterzzzzz. I started with Tirze now I have 3 more peptides for anti ageing and May pa glowta pa. 

I created a short FAQ list for everyone. Again, I am no expert nor a doctor. These are all basis my experience.

1m4y9p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1m4y9p3/yemeni_restaurant_on_cleveland_ave/,Yemeni Restaurant on Cleveland Ave,"This will be a blatant shill post for a restaurant I just tried today. It has a 4.7 with thousands of reviews on Google, so clearly it's been around awhile, but I haven't noticed much buzz for it here.

I actually wasn't even planning to eat, just wanted to get some coffee for my wife, and figured a Yemeni place on the map nearby would have good coffee. Well I didn't see any coffee on the menu (lol), but the place looked nice and we were already there, so we sat down for some tea and a couple appetizers.

A small complimentary cup of a delicious soup was offered immediately as we sat. I asked if the soup was vegetarian; it isn't. All I did was ask, and then eventually both soups ended up on my side of the table because my wife is vegetarian. Apparently they noticed this, and soon brought her a vegetarian soup to enjoy. That really stunned us. We haven't spent a dime yet or even requested anything, just reading our menus, yet they've gone above and beyond to offer a token of welcome. So we're already predisposed to enjoy this experience before even trying anything.

We got possibly the two simplest offerings on the menu, the hummus and the shakshouka. The flavors exceeded my wildest expectations. It was the best shakshouka I had in my life! The Yemeni tea was also very pleasant, like a chai blend with a nice (but not overpowered) sweetness. I generally do not sweeten my tea at all, so it's very easy to overdo that in my book, but it balanced very nicely against the chai spices and felt creamy, despite no milk being added.

We finished with a bread pudding that continued the trend of simple but delicately balanced flavors that reflected a deep care in creation and preparation. It seems they are not trying to reinvent any classics, but instead to execute them with such patience that you might suddenly remember why they became classics in the first place.

The whole experience was honestly inspiring. Of course I look forward to my next visit to Yemeni Restaurant (even the name couldn't be more simple and on-point?), but hopefully I'll also invest greater care in the next simple meal that I myself prepare, and anticipate the needs of the next people I host with as keen an eye. If my results are one quarter as impressive, I could be very proud indeed.",35,1753041028.0,Columbus,4,1.0,False

My entire childhood he has been the favorite child and I've always felt pushed to the side. For example my brother has always wanted to be a pilot so my parents enrolled him in extremely expensive flight classes so he got opportunities to meet pilots and fly planes, meanwhile I said I wanted to be a scuba diver and my parents enrolled me into a SINGLE free class. That is just one example of the obvious favoritism my childhood has run on. 

My brother has been to this plane convention before and since it's across the country it's pretty expensive to go (with flights and hotels and stuff) he's only gone once. It's been two years since he went and last time my mom agreed to let me stay home with her instead of going and we had a super fun camping weekend of just her and I. So when it was brought up that my brother (who we'll call Tyler) wanted to go again, I was fine with it expecting I would just have another cheap camping trip with my mom. Then Tyler told me he wanted both parents, meaning I'd have to come. I responded okay and I thought that that would be the end of it, but my parents kept bringing up ""how excited they were to go"" and ""Aren't you excited to go?"" I've never had any interest in planes, but I know not to get on the bad side of my parents, so I always just nod with a tight smile and change the subject. Whenever this happens around my brother he throws a borderline tantrum about how I'm being an asshole for not being enthusiastic about something only he likes. 

  Something important to mention by this point is my brother is extremely babied, which makes him act a lot more immature than kids his age, since I never got that same babied treatment from my parents I'm more like an older sibling-at least in my eyes.

   One time this happened we were waiting for coffee and we had just went shopping and Tyler had a cart and was repeatedly hitting it against a wall of a coffee shop. I gently told him to stop because my mom was too engrossed in her phone to notice anything. Somehow EAA (the plane thingy) was brought up and again, I did my classic tight smile uncomfortable nod. Tyler proceeded to get into a debate with me about it, saying I'd probably rather go to an anime convention (I'm a cosplayer who likes Five Nights at Freddy's) and I said ""yeah, I actually would prefer to go to an anime con"", which made Tyler get extremely angry and say ""Well even if you don't like planes EAA is fun, much more fun than a stupid FNAF thing"". Up to this point I had never downgraded his interest in planes, so this sudden attack felt random and rude. So fighting fire with fire I responded ""Well even if you don't like FNAF, FNAF and anime cons are super fun"", My mom now looked up from her phone and is glaring at me. He proceeded to say, ""Yeah well I'd never go to one of those because I don't like it"" and I told him that that was exactly how I felt about EAA. My mom proceeded to call me selfish and a brat and told me to stop because I was causing a scene. Later in the car she also told me to be nicer to my brother and my behavior was uncalled for and I needed to suck it up and at least act interested. Since then, my mom and Tyler have been cold to me. 

  I genuinely don't know what to do and just plan on staying quiet that whole trip and just not saying much. My dad insists it's fun, but I know I won't enjoy it. He told me he booked an extra day in said town so we could do something I wanted (Mind you this convention is a WEEK long and they gave me one day). I agreed and now all of a sudden we can't spend that day because my dad ""booked the flights wrong"" and that I could go see a concert in town or something. I live in an extremely small town. The only people playing are your classic, small borderline cringe country singers. I just told him it's whatever and to not worry about it. So, Am I The Asshole??",18,1753040659.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

I moved here for a job with no friends and no one I knew in the area. Now I'm pretty active on the weekends with different friends. 

My secret? I get outside as much as I can and I work in DC but live in Reston. I had to visit a lot of places to scope out places to meet people and I think ive found the best places:

*Kramers - great place to visit on Saturday afternoons, a lot of people go in and out often so you'll meet a lot of potential people to talk to and starring conversations is so easy ""what book are you reading?"".

*Kaldi's coffee shop - more or less the same as Kramers but a lot less people that go in and out often. Starters ""excuse me what drink/food would you recommend?""

*trader joes in Arlington - another good place to meet people who are grocery shopping and talk to them about what foods they are making for the week, starter ""excuse me what are you making with the pasta in your basket?"" 

*Ballston - a lot of people that go out and about in this area but are pretty friendly when you ask them where a store is located and like to have conversations.


The key here is that you have to get to these stores and start talking. I have heard people in the DMV have a don't ask don't tell mindset where people are antisocial because they aren't approached but as someone who is somewhat extroverted this is a cheat code. I've met a lot of men and women through this process and even have a gf that I met 6 months back at Kramers, now we go at the last Saturday of everymonth to check out the place. So if you want to see some good results or just tired of being at home, get outside to these places as Saturdays seem to be the best days to go.",8,1753040615.0,nova,3,0.9,False

1m4y0k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m4y0k9/bambino_plus_return_review/,Bambino Plus return review,"I started my espresso journey with a bambino plus and a crappy grinder, I eventually upgraded to a Niche Zero which I used with the bambino for about a year or 2. Last December I made the $1600 jump to the Lelit Mara X. I just went on vacation with my family and I didn’t want bring the Mara so I dusted off the bambino and used it for the week.

I thought this was a unique opportunity to go back to what I started with and give my honest take on how it compares to more expensive machines like my Mara X and if the price jump is really worth it. Although I try to learn and experiment with espresso, I am in no way an expert, I don’t overly tinker with things, and I don’t pretend to taste every note of fig or hazelnut in my espresso.

As far as straight espresso brewing/extraction, I honestly believe the Mara X gives me a better tasting espresso. I don’t think it’s a huge difference but it was noticeable both straight and in my cappuccino which I pretty much exclusively drink. I just felt the Mara X gave me stronger flavor/extraction, the coffee flavor punches through my drink more and I thought it tasted a little fuller bodied and less acidic.

As far as the steam wand goes, I was getting a lot of practice with the Mara so I tried manually steaming with the bambino for the first time and I was really impressed actually. In some ways I actually preferred it, I thought it was a little more forgiving because it doesn’t have as much power as the Mara. So if you screwed up a bit and injected a little too much air at some point or something it didn’t seem to have as much as an impact. I was able to make a pretty nice velvety microfoam in under a minute. I will say that if I don’t make any mistakes on the Mara, I think I get a slightly smoother, more homogenous microfoam which is a bit more luscious. 

Build quality, big win to Lelit, the breville feels cheap and a bit clunky but it’s also instant and doesn’t need a 15-20minute heat up time. Optics, the Mara is just cool looking if you’re into that style. 

Overall, I was pretty impressed with my little $400 machine that’s gotten a lot of use. I think if you just want to get into espresso and make a decent drink then this will suit you well, I think the grinder is more important like most people say. If I had to put some sort of rating on it I would say my Mara x gives me like a 8.75/10 espresso shot in terms of quality and taste and the bambino gave me a 7/10. So not far behind. I wouldn’t make the jump to a more expensive machine unless you enjoy the actual process of making espresso and you truly have the budget for one. If you drink straight espresso I think you will taste the difference and be happy with your upgrade, if you primarily drink milk drinks, you may taste the difference but it won’t be a huge jump. Your coffee flavor may just punch through the drink more and perhaps give you a fuller bodied drink. 

I’m sure other people feel differently but wanted to give my opinion. Maybe this will help somebody make a choice!

1m4y0ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m4y0ew/what_are_some_simple_and_affordable_coffee_table/,What are some simple and affordable coffee table decorating ideas?,"After spending countless hours experimenting with different coffee table setups in my living room, I've discovered some really practical and budget-friendly ways to make this central piece of furniture stand out without breaking the bank.

First things first - if you're in the market for a new coffee table, I found some amazing deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. I personally prefer wooden tables because they're versatile and timeless, but there are tons of options for every style.

Now, let's talk about decorating. One of my favorite approaches is using books - not just any books, but large, colorful ones about topics you actually care about. I stack them in small piles of 2-3 books, which creates different height levels and makes the arrangement more interesting.

Plants are another game-changer. A small succulent or air plant can add life to your table without requiring much maintenance. I keep mine in a simple ceramic pot, and it's survived my occasional forgetfulness to water it.

Trays are essential for organization. I use a simple wooden tray to group smaller items together, which keeps everything from looking cluttered. It's also super convenient when I need to clear the table quickly for cleaning or when having guests over.

For seasonal touches, I switch out small decorative items. During fall, I might add some pine cones or a small pumpkin. In summer, a glass bowl with seashells works great. These little changes keep the space feeling fresh without requiring much effort or money.

Candles are another affordable way to add ambiance. I prefer unscented ones in simple glass holders - they look elegant and don't compete with other room scents. Plus, they're perfect for creating a cozy atmosphere in the evening.

If you're still looking for the perfect coffee table to decorate, check out these options: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. They have everything from modern to traditional styles.

Remember, the key is not to overcrowd. I follow the ""rule of three"" - grouping decorative items in threes creates visual balance while keeping things simple. And don't feel pressured to buy everything at once. I built my coffee table display gradually, adding pieces as I found ones I really loved.

Lastly, make it personal. I added a small vintage box I found at a flea market that holds our TV remotes. It's both practical and adds character. Your coffee table should reflect your style while remaining functional for everyday use.",1,1753040386.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

**His arms wrap around me without hesitation—warm, solid, real. I feel the pressure of his hands between my shoulder blades, hear the low, familiar laugh against my ear. It’s him. It’s really him.**

**I pull back, slowly. My hands press against his chest, as if they’re checking for seams or stitches. His eyes meet mine, bright as ever, but a little too wide.**

**I shut the door behind him before the cold evening air can follow. My fingers tremble on the handle. My heart races as my vision tries focusing, not to relive that night like I have been.**

**He walks slowly down the hall like muscle memory’s guiding him, grabbing a soda from the fridge like no time’s passed. He even sits in the same spot on the couch where he used to fall asleep during movie nights.**

**And for a moment, I wonder—maybe I** ***want*** **this to be real. I look at the empty cans all over my living room table.** 

**“You gonna come sit down, buddy?” He asks, taking another sip from his drink.** 

**I pull out my cell phone, trying to calm myself as I open the camera app, taking a quick picture of him. He raises a hand and winces at the flash.** 

**“Yo, what are you doing, dude?”**

**“Just-hold on, man. Alright? Hold the fuck on..”**

**“Sheesh, you gotta chill out, dude..”**

**I hold the camera up, looking at his picture in the gallery for a moment before opening the messaging app. The last message was two days ago. I send out the photo to the group chat and wait as the first name sees it.** 

**Jacob leans forward, picking up an older book off my coffee table. It's got stains across the cover.** 

**“Interpretation of dreams, huh..” he examines the cover with a smirk before opening to the first page, “never thought you'd be interested in this stuff. Makes me wonder what the rest of the guys have been up to.”**

**My phone starts ringing.** 

**I look back to Jacob again, vision blurring as my eyes grow wet.** 

**“Jacob?”**

**“Told ya, it’s me, dude.” He laughs.**

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**The living room is louder now. Alive with voices, music, and the snap of beer cans. Everyone's here.**

**Kylie got here first, slamming the car door before sprinting up the steps. She didn’t say a word to me once she saw him, just forced him into the biggest hug I’ve seen her give.** 

**Noah followed close behind, stumbling to a stop in the doorway with his jaw hanging open.** 

**Liv cried. Quietly, at first, then full-on sobbing as Jacob laughed awkwardly and patted her back.**

**Sam’s hugging Jacob so hard his drink spills down his arm. Marcus hasn’t taken his eyes off Jacob since he walked in the door.**

**“We thought you were dead, man,” Sam says, pulling back, eyes wide. “We** ***saw*** **your body. We had a** ***service.*** **You don’t just.. How the hell are you here? Where the hell have you been for the last two years?”**

**Jacob shrugs, like it’s not a big deal. “I dunno. One second, it was all gone, The next—I’m waking up on the side of the road. Maybe someone up there realized I wasn’t ready?”**

**“That’s not.. We saw your body..” Noah takes a long swig from the beer in his hands.** 

**We were all sitting around the room like it was two years ago. Like he never went missing. Like we didn’t hold each other on the deck of the cabin, cold and shaking, waiting for the search team to come back with a body.** 

**But now he’s here. With the same voice. The same dumb hoodie he always wore. Same chipped tooth from when we went surfing freshman year.**

**We all watch as he struggles to think of an answer, looking around the group.** 

**Kylie coughs into her hand and forces a smile. “Let’s not do this now, alright? He’s back. Somehow. That’s gotta count for something.”**

**Jacob raises his drink. “Exactly. Let’s just... celebrate, yeah?”**

**They all raise their glasses, except Sam. I do too, though my hand is shaking.**

**“Well.. at least you don’t smell as bad.” Marcus chuckles. Everyone else follows suit, Jacob shaking his head as he takes another sip from his soda.** 

**That part was definitely true. Don’t get me wrong, Jacob never really stank, but he was one of those dudes that needed to wear deodorant, y’know? Like, his bo was immediately pungent every day. Now, he doesn’t smell bad at all. Like wet leaves and plastic. It fades when he moves, but catches in the air when he sits still. It’s hard not to notice the distinction.** 

**The night is a blur of laughter and disbelief. Old stories resurface like no time passed.** 

**“Alright,” Jacob says, finishing his soda and places it next to my beer on the table. “Let’s do it.”**

**“Do what?” Marcus asks, wiping his face.**

**He claps his hands together like he’s just pitched the best idea in the world. “The cabin. Let’s go back.”**

**The room falls silent.**

**Kylie’s eyes narrow. “Jacob… we haven’t been back since—”**

**“No. No fucking way, what are-what!?” Sam leaps up.** 

**“Easy, Sam..” I speak up, still caught off guard.** 

**“Fuck you-easy. He fucking died at that cabin and now he wants to go back?! Jacob, no offence man, but what the actual fuck?!”**

**“Exactly,” Jacob interrupts. “That’s why we should go back! One last trip. Come on! We’ve gone to that cabin every year since we were kids.. I don’t want you guys to just see that cabin as a bad memory, let’s fix that!”**

**I glance at Liv. She’s biting her lip. Sam looks between us both.**

**“Oh, you’ve gotta be fucking kidding me..”**

**“Sam, sit the hell down, bro.” Marcus chips in from the table.** 

**“That place is cursed,” Liv whispers.**

**Jacob laughs. “So you** ***do*** **think I came back from the dead.”**

**Nobody corrects him.**

**“Look, I don’t like it, but if that’s what you’d really want..” Kylie says, a deep sigh leaving her as she escapes back into her beer.** 

**“That doesn’t seem healthy, man..” Noah says, patting Sams back as he sits back down beside him, “Don’t you wanna go home?”**

**“I already talked to my folks about it, mom was chill with it.”**

**“Chill? Your mom?” Sam asks, shaking his head.** 

**“Yeah, man, she understood, alright?”**

**“I just don’t get it, bro, why would you possibly wanna go back up there? You literally just got back from.. Well, wherever the hell you were..” Marcus stands, grabbing for another beer from my kitchen counter.**

**“That’s exactly man, dude! Maybe if we go up there, I can remember something!”**

**We all look amongst each other, each waiting for someone to speak some sense into him.** 

**“We’re not kids anymore,” he says, softer this time. “And we’ve all changed. But it’d mean a lot to me if we could just go. Just one last time. Like nothing ever happened.”**

**He’s looking straight at me now. And something in his face… not wrong. Just a beat too still.**

**“Please.”**

**And God help me, I nod.**

**“Great!” Jacob says, smiling wide as he stands up, “let’s get goin’!”**

**“Wait, what,” Lena asks, voice tight. “Now?”**

**“Why not?” Jacob says, “I should have my things still up there.”**

**“Wait, why would your things be up there-”**

**“Jacob, it’s late man, we can’t just go right now.” Kylie says. He sighs.** 

**“Hold the hell up, who said we were even going?!” Sam shouts again**

**Jacob looks around the room, eyes glinting.** 

**I swear they flash—just for a second—*****too bright*** **in the low light.**  
  


**Kylie speaks up again, gently but firmly. “We’ll go tomorrow, okay? If we’re really doing this, let’s at least pack for the trip this time.”**

**“Yeah,” Marcus nods, cracking his last beer open. “I’ve got work crap to finish tonight anyway. Let’s meet at Greys early, say eightish?”**

**“Eight?” Liv groans.**

**“Eight-thirty, then,” Kylie says.**

**Jacob hesitates, then throws up his hands. “Alright, alright—tomorrow it is. Just figured, y’know…waited long enough.”**

**The group starts to break apart—Sam grumbles something under his breath but doesn’t fight it this time. Noah and Marcus start stacking up empties after Marcus jugs the beer,  Liv scrolls through her phone in that frantic way people do when they’re trying to avoid looking at something real.** 

**Everyone’s trying to make sense of what the hell just happened, and none of us are doing a great job.**

**Jacob pats my shoulder and grins. “It’ll be good, man. You’ll see.”**

**I nod weakly, not trusting my voice.**

**Jacob steps toward the door, stretching with a content sigh. “Alright, guess I should get going. I’ve got my bag packed already—left it at the house.”**

**He grabs the handle, then pauses. His tone stays light, offhanded.**

**“Still take that left at Miller’s Creek, yeah? Getting a little turned around here.”**

**“Yeah,” I mutter without thinking. “Just past the station.”**

**He gives a small nod, satisfied. “Right. That’s what I thought.”**

**The door shuts behind him with a quiet click.**

**No one says a word for a moment.** 

**“Wait, did he drive here?” Sam asks. Noah sighs as everyone looks around at each other.** 

**“I’ll give the dumbass a ride, see y’all tomorrow..” He rushes out as we all mumble our goodbyes, closing the door behind him as he puts on his coat.** 

**Everyone starts grabbing their stuff, the mood weirdly weightless, like we’re pretending this isn’t the most impossible night of our lives. Somehow we’ve all agreed: we’re going back to the cabin.**

**“So..” Sam speaks up, “Our friend that we all saw definitely die just came back and now we’re going back where he died?”**

**We all just silently nod.** 

**“Great. Just wanted to make sure I wasn’t** ***losingmyfuckingmind*****,” He mutters the last part under his breath, “See you guys tomorrow, I guess.” He grabs his keys off the table and heads out.** 

**“I can’t believe he’s actually back..” Kylie mumbles, slumping back into the couch beside me. She looks at the soda can on the table, her head tilting as her brow burrows together.** 

**“Me neither..” I say, leaning back and wrapping my arm around her. She leans into me.**

**“I mean..” Liv starts as Marcus sits down on the love seat. “.. I don’t know what to think, actually.”**

**“Same.” Marcus bellows out with a cough, covering his mouth as he does, eyes wide. We all look over to him and he waves us off, “Sorry, heh, just.. I mean what the fuck?” He sighs while leaning back into the seat. “Like.. no, seriously, what the actual fuck?”**

**“Your guess is as good as mine, man..” I reply.**

**“So like.. What the actual fuck?!”** 

**“I know!” I laugh, though it’s weak.**

**“Don’t get me wrong, this is one of the best days of my life, bro.. But what in the actual FUCK!?” He shouts this time, we all chuckle. There really was no other words to describe the feeling. What the fuck.**

  
  
  


**The sky’s still gray when I pull into the lot. Mist clings to the asphalt, thick and low. Kylie’s already there, leaning against her car, thermos in one hand, cigarette in the other. She’s bundled up in her big flannel, hood up, fingers tucked in her sleeves to fight the growing chill of fall.**

**She doesn’t notice me at first. Just stares off down the road.**

**“Morning,” I call from my car as I shut my door.**

**She looks over and gives me a tired smile. “Coffee?” she offers, holding out the thermos.**

**I take it and nod. “Thanks.”**

**She doesn’t ask if I slept. She already knows the answer. And I don’t ask her either.** 

**“You okay, hun?”**

**“Ye-” I spit out some coffee as I try speaking mid gulp, she grabs the thermos from me as I cough a bit, “Yeah, I’m alright, why?”**

**She smiles as she sits the thermos on her hood. “Just been a while, y’know. I-We missed you.”**

**I had a creeping suspicion the talk would come at some point. At least she waited for us to be alone for it.** 

**“Yeah, look, I just.. He died, man. I mean, Jacob fucking died and I..” I look toward the sky as my eyes scramble for some sort of answer. Her hand guides me back down when it touches my shoulder. I meet her eyes.**

**“It’s alright, hun. Just.. y’know, don’t do it again, alright?”**

**“Heh, yeah, alright.” I smile back.** 

**“You can ride with me on the way, get some actual sleep.” She starts fixing my hair, continuing even as I try swatting her hands away.**

**“I don’t need sleep, I’m fine-damnit, how are you so fast?”**

**“I’ve always been faster than you, dummy..” She smiles weakly as she curls a bang on my forehead, one final touch up, “also smarter. You can’t lie to me, babe. I see those dark buns.”**

**“Says the one that didn’t even notice my car, maybe you should sleep. I’ll drive us.”**

**“First, I did notice you, second, there’s no way in hell I'm letting- wait, how did you drive here- John!” She starts playfully smacking my body as I flinch away with every word, “You. can’t.drink.and.drive!”** 

**“Hey! We all got drunk last night, lady!”**

**Liv arrives with Marcus next, climbing out of his car with her hoodie pulled halfway over her face. She waves at us, sheepish, then retreats back into her sleeves. She doesn’t say anything, just drifts toward Kylie, who wraps an arm around her shoulders like a reflex.**

**Sam rolls in blasting music, shuts it off the second he sees us. He doesn’t look too thrilled, but at least he’s here. “No Jacob yet?”**

**No one answers as we all look around, “Is Jacob with us right now?” Marcus asks.**

**“No?” Sam mutters as he gets out.** 

**“Well there you go..” I chuckle lightly.** 

**“Alright, dick..” He makes his way over, “Dude’s been dead for two years and he’s still late to his own damn party.” He chuckles. Kylie wraps him in a quick hug before looking back at a car on the way down the road.** 

**Jacob.** 

**Wait, no, it’s Noah. He pulls in with Jacob’s truck.**

**Noah steps out, eyes puffy like he didn’t sleep either. He slams the door too hard and mutters, “Morning.” as he steps over.** 

**Kylie frowns. “Where’s Jacob?”**

**“Said he wanted to take his own car,” Noah says without looking at her. “Grab a few more things. He’s meeting us there.”**

**His voice sounds hollow.**

**“Hey,” Kylie says, stepping toward him. “You okay?”**

**“Since when does Jacob have two cars?” Marcus asks.**

**Noah hesitates. His jaw twitches. “Yeah. Just tired.”**

**“And why does Jacob have his fucking truck?” Sam whispers next to us.**

**Kylie lets it drop, but I can see it still working behind her eyes.**

**We load the cars in silence.**

**Sam stands off to the side, arms crossed, scanning the street. “This still feels wrong,” he mutters.**

**“Yeah,” Marcus says, hoisting a duffel bag into the trunk. “So did seeing him alive again. Guess we’re just rolling with it at this point.”**

**Marcus meets my eyes when he says it. Like he’s checking to see if I’m actually holding it together. I give him a weak nod and open the passenger side door. My hands are already shaking. Should get the drink out of my bag, but I really don’t wanna hear about it.**

**We take two cars: Kylie and Marcus’. Noah and I ride with Kylie. Liv, Sam, and Marcus pile into the second car.** 

**“I’ll lead!” Marcus shouts as he starts his car up, immediately pulling out of the parking lot. We leave behind him, Noah nestling his back into the back seat as we pass the edge of downtown, flashing red-and-blues catch my eye.**

**Two cruisers sit at the edge of the street. Yellow tape strung up near the alley behind Lenny’s. The place has some killer waffles, it’s the only place ever open past midnight in town.** 

**The cars slow down, instinctively.**

**“Jesus,” Kylie murmurs. “Is that… blood?”**

**Something dark stains the pavement beneath the tape. An officer stands near it, looking pale and kinda pissed.**

**Noah leans forward. “Why are we stopping?”**

**“You don’t see that?” I ask**

**He doesn’t answer, just sits back, “I’d rather not make Jacob wait any more than he has to.”**

**My phone rings before I can retort.**

**“Yaup.” I answer Marcus.** 

**“Can you see anything?”**

**“Who is it?” Kylie asks, now looking at me.** 

**“Marcus. Uh, no, not really. Some blood-”**

**“What does he want?” She whispers.** 

**“Yeah, we saw that. Wonder what’s going on?”**

**“He’s asking if we saw anything-Yeah, I don’t know, man, seems bad enough if they got both cops on it-”**

**“What’s he saying?” She whispers.** 

**“Would you jus-”**

**“Yeah, that’s what I was-hey what the hel-”**

**“Hey, it’s Sam, you don’t think- get the hell off, damnit, you’re driving.” I hear Marcus’s voice muffled in the background, something about it being his phone. There’s sounds of a struggle.** 

**“Just put it on speaker!” Kylie whispers louder.**

**“What, no, just chill the hell out, would ya?”**

**“What?” Sam asks.**

**“No, not you.”**

**“Well what’d you say- hey get the hell-”**

**“What are they saying now?” She whispers.**

**“They’re just fighting over the phone.. Probably.” Noah tells her.** 

**“Let me listen!”** 

**“Kylie-would you stop..” I hold the phone out the window away from here, “Damnit, hey.” I put it back to my ear, leaning out the window fully, “Look, I’m hanging up alright.”**

**“Why are you being so weird!” She shouts, reaching moreso after putting the car in park.**

**“Why are YOU being weird?!”**

**“What? Oh, you’re hanging up?”**

**“Give me the damn phone!” Marcus shouts, finally wrestling it back.** 

**“John, you there?”** 

**“Yeah, go- just, here, damnit, here!” I toss the phone in her lap and she lunges for it, pressing her palm into my face as she puts it to her ear with the other. “What are you-” I start smacking it away.**

**“Sorry, hey, Markie, it’s me. I know, yeah he was being really weird..” She smiles, “Yeah, alright, We’ll see ya there. Alright, bye, babe.”**

**She tosses the phone back into my lap and finally lets my face go. I can feel the red in my cheeks starting to calm down.** 

**“What the hell?!” I shout.** 

**“Oh, hush.” She pulls the lever back into drive and the car begins going again. “Marcus said hi, by the way.”**

**I shake my head, looking back to the yellow tape as we leave it behind.**

**It’s been a couple years since I’ve seen it.** 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**On the highway, we fall into a steady rhythm. Gray sky above trying to reveal the sun, but being stopped by all the thin clouds gathering. Wet trees on either side of the road. Miles stretch on in silence.**

**I check my mirror. Noah’s still leaning back. But he’s digging his eyes into the back of Kylie's head.** 

**“You uh, you tell Jacob we’re on the way?” I ask him, twisting in the seat a bit.**

**“What’s that?”**

**“I said, Did you tell Jacob we were on the way?”**

**“Oh.. he knows, why?”**

**“Huh?”**

**“Why are you asking?”**

**“Oh, I just.. Uh.. I don’t know man, just trying to make conversation to fill the time, y’know?”**

**“..Why?”**

**“Alrighty, that conversation is going nowhere..” I twist back, noticing Kylie's smile, “*****Forgot how much of a buzzkill you can be*****, Hey, how much longer?” I hold my hands together in my lap, the tremors getting worse. I’ll need to stop soon.** 

**“Uh, I don’t know, Hun, probably soonish.” Kylie shrugs her right shoulder, making a goofy face with her mouth as she looks on at the road.  I slump back with a sigh. Staring ahead, barely able to see Marcus’s car. I start bobbing my knee, then reach for the radio.**

**“Might as well get some-” The radio blurs out static, causing me to reach for my ears.**

**“Holy shi-turn it off, turn it off!” Kylie winces, gripping the wheel tighter. I use one hand to scroll the knob all the way down. “What the fuck..”** 

**“Heh, music just isn’t what it used to be huh?” she shakes her head, I know she’s trying really hard not to laugh. “Kinda sounded like that guy you like, what was his-”**

**“D.o.S, are you really saying that sounds like-no, I’m not giving you the satisfaction..” She drives a bit more in silence.** 

**“What? I thought it was pretty good! Why so defensive, sheesh!”** 

**“You were always jealous of my lovers, but this is a new low, John.” She chuckles.**

**“Sheeet.” I chuckle, leaning an elbow against the door and looking at the trees as they pass. Time to imagine the ninja man like the good ol days..**

**After a long while, I glance over as the road curves sharply and the trees part. There it is. The cabin, sitting dark and quiet, framed by bare branches scraping the sky. The windows look like empty eyes watching us come back.**

**Marcus’s car is already sitting in the driveway, alongside an older Sedan. I can’t put where I remember it from together, but it’s definitely familiar. As we pull in, Jacob is standing beside Marcus, nodding at us.** 

**I twist back real quick, Noah’s face is unreadable, but his fingers tap nervously on the door handle.**

**We step out, boots crunching on the gravel driveway, and the wind picks up, carrying a faint scent of damp grass.. Along with something metallic.**

**I swallow hard, trying to steady my breath. I can’t help but shiver against a chill down my spine.** 

**We all walk over to the other group, I can’t help but check on Jacob. But even from this distance, something feels off. His smile is too wide, too still, especially for somebody that was just dead two days ago.**

**“Oh, Jake, hun, did your mom get a new phone?” Kylie asks him.**

**He tilts his head, “Mom?”**

**“Yeah, she hasn’t been answering me, I wanted to talk to her about-well, you.”**

**“Oh, you two get along now, huh? That’s good to see, dude!”**

**“We always got along?” Kylie almost whispers.**

**“I don’t know, though, I’ll ask her to reach out to ya.” She nods, taking that as good enough for now. We all stand as a group, each taking steps onto the porch once more. Jacob extends his arms out wide toward the door.** 

**“Welcome back,” he stretches the words, voice smooth, eyes glinting in the fading light.**

**We all exchange uneasy glances as the sky hastens, the trees seeming to close in around us.**

**We really were back.**

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**The front door creaks as Jacob pushes it open with a theatrical sweep of his hand.**

**“After you,” he grins.**

**Inside, it’s dark. No lights. No fire. Just cold, stale air pressing against us like we’re breaking a seal.**

**Marcus moves first. One bootstep over the threshold, then the other. He stops just past the doorway and exhales.**

**The cabin smells like old wood and dried pine. But underneath that, there’s something else—wet soil? Old leather? A faint, bitter tinge of iron.**

**I step in next.**

**The living room’s exactly as we left it.**

**The battered blue couch in the corner, where Marcus once fell asleep with a bag of chips crunched under him. The coffee table with the warped leg and a faint brown ring stain that never scrubbed out. Kylie's old quilt still draped over the backrest, folded too neatly. Even the same magazines sit fanned out on the end table—same issue numbers, same tears in the cover. I notice Kylie staring at the couch, frozen in place.** 

**There’s no dust.**

**No cobwebs in the corners.**

**To the left, the kitchenette looks untouched. Cabinets shut tight, counters scrubbed clean. The old kettle we used for popcorn still rests on the stove. And beside it, on the wall—our old Polaroid photos. Still there. Still pinned in the exact crooked line we left them in. Each having us grow in age alongside them.** 

**I walk closer. Each photo is clearer than I remember. Like they’ve been reprinted. The corners are too crisp. The tape is fresh, like it was just stuck on yesterday. I grab one photo of all of us on the dock—I swear, Jacob isn’t** ***blinking,*** **but his face is… blurred in place.**

**I step back.**

**The hallway leading to the bedrooms is even darker. The doors seem to be cracked open, but I can’t see much without the daylight from the front door.** 

**“Place looks the same,” Marcus mutters behind me, tapping my shoulder as he walks toward the hall. His voice echoes along the walls, but it sounds deeper.**

**“No dust..” Sam adds, stepping inside slowly.**

**Liv frowns, arms folded tight across her chest as she surveys the room. “Did someone come up here and clean it?” she asks, but no one answers.**

**Jacob strolls forward, casual as ever, heading to the fireplace. He kneels down, stacking a few logs like it’s a normal Friday night.**

**“You’ve already come up here,” Kylie says, watching him. “Haven’t you?”**

**“Yeah.” He shrugs. “I-well, just this morning. Got here extra early to clean the place up for us, y’know?”**

**Click. He strikes a match. The fire sputters and pops to life, casting flickering orange across the room.**

**And for a second, it feels warm again. Familiar. I can feel the chill leave me as Noah closes the door behind him, setting a bag off his shoulder onto the ground.**

**“Make yourselves at home,” Jacob says, standing back and dusting off his hands. That damn smile still stuck to his face like it’s been painted there.**

**We linger in the living room a minute longer, standing around like strangers at our own funeral. Then Marcus claps his hands once, loud and final.**

**“Alright,” he says. “Call your beds. I’m not sleeping on the damn couch.”**

**That breaks it. Sam groans and heads for the hall, Liv following close behind with her duffel bag clutched to her chest. Marcus ruffles her hood as she passes. She still doesn’t say much, but the way she glances toward the old bunk room says enough. That was always her spot.**

**Noah crosses the room and flicks on the hallway lights. He jolts for a moment, almost like he didn’t expect them to work.** 

**The bulbs buzz to life. They’re a little too dim, but enough to cut through the dark. The hallway stretches long, carpet still matted in the same places from years of pacing feet. Dust motes float in the air, catching the light like ash.**

**Marcus takes the room on the right with the broken dresser. He always did. Says it ‘builds character.’ Whatever the hell that means.** 

**Sam disappears into the room across from him without a word.**

**I move to grab my bag back off the ground, but Kylie’s already got it slung over her shoulder.**

**“I got it,” she says, smirking a little. “I’m stronger than you, remember?”**

**“Stronger, huh?”**

**“Always have been, babe.” She bumps me lightly with her hip, then heads toward the hall, calling back, “You still want the loft, or you taking the bunks?”**

**I shake my head, grabbing her three bags and follow close behind her. “Loft’s mine. Good one, by the way.” I snark, my breathing getting a bit ragged.**

**The loft is in the last room on the left. It was the smallest in the cabin, made to be a closet, tucked beneath the angled ceiling, but it’s got a window that faces the lake, a desk just beside it and just enough room for a mattress along with a nightstand. We spent an entire weekend repurposing it when we were younger. Pretty sure the walls are thicker.** 

**Kylie tosses the bag down at the edge of the mattress and turns to face me, brushing her raven shined hair back from her face. The light from the hall throws a soft glow across her grassy eyes and for a second, I feel like I'm Seventeen again.** 

**“I think it still has that smell,” she says, wrinkling her nose. “Like cheap deodorant and body axe.”**

**“Could be worse,” I say, trying to hide my grin. “Could smell like Mark’s gym bag.”**

**She snorts. “Same thing.”**

**I subtly rock back and forth on my feet, not quite ready to leave the moment.**

**“You doing okay?” she asks after a beat, voice quieter now. “I mean it. You’ve been kind of… ghosty lately. And not the cute Casper kind.”**

**I exhale through my nose and lean back against the leaning ceiling “I dunno. Being here’s weird. He’s here, y’know? Like nothing happened. But something definitely did. And I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, my best friend died two years ago, Kai, two years ago they brought his damn body up here, now he’s back and acting like nothing happened and we’re back here and I haven’t had a drink and-”**

**She stands and rests a hand on my shoulder. “Hey, hey..”**

**“I mean, are we all just gonna ignore the fact he doesn’t look like he’s aged a day? Or how he’s acting like nothing happened? It’s been two years, what the actual fuck are we doing here?”**

**Kylie bites her lip and glances toward the door “We’re not ignoring it. We’re just…We all needed this.”**

**She pauses.**

**“I needed this.”**

**I look at her, really look at her. The worry behind her eyes. The way she’s trying to hold the group together like she always has. And the way she looks at me, like maybe she still sees something in me I’m not sure is there anymore.**

**“Damnit, Kai, I’m..” I say, softly. “Thanks. For the coffee. For being here.”**

**Her gaze lingers on mine, warm and unreadable. “Of course, Hun. I never left..”**

**We both smile a little too long at that, and the silence that follows feels charged.** 

**She shifts slightly, her arm brushing mine as she turns toward the door. “I’m gonna go help Liv unpack. Try not to stay in here for too long, okay?”**

**“Can’t make any promises.”**

**Kylie stops in the doorway, half-smiling over her shoulder. “Good. I like a man that can keep me guessing.”**

**Then she’s gone, her footsteps padding down the hall.** 

**“Yo, Kylie, look at this shit..” I hear Marcus try to whisper as she passes his door. I close the door behind her.** 

**I stand there for a while, heart weirdly full, head still spinning. I glance around the loft—same ceiling stains, same warped wood panels—but somehow it feels smaller now. Or maybe I’m just bigger.** 

**I can’t help but explore the room, placing a hand against the window, looking out toward the dying sun beyond the tree line. I try to open it, but strain. I duck down, noticing the hinges bolted shut. I could’ve sworn we used to leave it open. I’m half tempted just to take the glass out, but it’s way too thick to bother. Smashing a window might not be the best idea right now, anyways.** 

**With a deep sigh, I turn to the desk, yanking the old school chair back and pulling the middle chore open. Ergonomics 101. I grab the book and open the front page with a smile, noting all the lame notes Jacob had written through it. The top of the page has the title crossed out, replaced with ‘Getting bitches 169’. I can’t help but chuckle lightly when I notice all the times he obviously erased the word bitches to spell it right. I toss the book on the desk and look at the walls for a bit.**

**Eventually I sit down on the mattress and crack open my bag. My clammy hands struggling to dig through it quick enough, grasping at the flask deeper inside.** 

**I feel my breath leave as I twist the top off, finally getting the sweet tangy feeling once more. Everything is right again. My mind clears up, the temperature drops in the room, my face stops sweating. Thank god for whatever I put in this thing.** 

**I take a longer swig, cutting myself off midway and closing the metal cap. Can’t lose myself tonight, gotta pace it out. At least until tonight.**

**Outside, I hear laughter. Sam shouting something about who’s cooking. Liv’s soft laugh. And somewhere in it all—Kylie’s voice, smooth and bright.**

**Like always.**

**Stop. Stop that. I uncap the flask and take another swig. Alright.** 

**I take another swig then tighten the cap, scrapping my hand as I keep trying to make it tighter. I really don’t need anymore. Not right now.**

**The fifth sip goes down much lighter.** 

**Now I can put it—**

**The door swings open and slams into the wall with enough force to rattle the frame.**

**“Yo, you coming out or-”**

**Marcus freezes, hand hanging on the top of the door.** 

**We lock eyes.**

**He sees the flask before I can tuck it behind me. His eyes land on it, then on me. That quiet calculation behind them shifts into something harder.**

**I lower it slowly, putting it into the bag and laying it on the ground.** 

**He doesn’t say anything right away. Just closes the door behind him with a soft click.**

**“Unpacking, huh?” he says, voice low.**

**I sigh, trying to keep it light. “It’s just a little—”**

**“Don’t,” he cuts me off, stepping forward. “Give it here.”**

**“It’s empty.” I lie.**

**“Great, makes it a no brainer then.”**

**I sigh.** 

**He scoffs. “Man, you’ve been gone for months. Barely answer any of our texts. Your house is full of fucking beer cans and empty pizza boxes. You show up to the lot this morning smelling like you crashed in a bar bathroom, and now I walk in and see you sneaking a drink like we’re in the back of my moms van?”**

**“It’s not a big deal.” My voice cracks sharper than I meant.**

**Marcus stares at me for what feels like forever.** 

**“I’m not trying to be your mom, alright? That's Kylie's job,” he says, sitting on the arm of the old desk near the window. “But it’s been two years, John. Two. You think none of us were hurt when Jacob died?”**

**I look down at the bag.**

**“I know,” I say. “I just… I don’t know what to do, man.. i've been seeing the guy in my dreams every fuckin night. I can't even wake up without having a damn panic attack. It was the only way I could.. I didnt wanna be around you guys when I'm like this. Like him.”**

**He leans forward, “Hey. You are not him. Hell, you think I’m fine? I still remember that call every night.. The way Sammy was pacing back and forth in the kitchen. I still see Liz’s eyes when they were loading up his body.”**

**Marcus reaches out and takes it from my hand. I didn't even realize I pulled the damn thing back out.** 

**He walks over to the larger window, trying to open it. He looks at me after noticing the bolts.** 

**“Yeah, I don’t know..”** 

**He puts the flask in his pocket.  “Come on,” he says. “Dinner’s happening. Kylie’s making that pasta mess she likes and Jacob said he’s grilling. Which is already weird, since he always hated grilling.”**

**“I don’t think we even have a grill out here..”**

**“Heh, we don’t. Dude’s fuckin’ weird. But I guess that’s what happens when you die for two years.”**

**He heads for the door, then pauses.**

**“You coming?”**

**I hesitate.**

**But then I nod.**

**“Yeah,” I say, standing slowly. “Yeah, I’m coming.” I dust off my legs, grabbing the bag as I stand fully and tossing it on the bed. I’ll unpack after.** 

**I follow him down the hall, noting all the doors are closed.**

**And my hands grasp together, the flask staying behind for some damn reason.**

Quiet couple with a dog, stayed two weeks. They checked out this morning. We walk in to clean and smell an…odd smell. We can’t place it. It was strange and something neither my husband nor I had smelled before. Definitely not weed, but something that was off and chemical-ish. There was trash on the floors, on the shelves in the living room, and on the kitchen counters. Half our teaspoons and a coffee cup gone. And while we knew the guests had a dog, it turned out they also brought an undeclared cat — so there was cat litter, dog fur, and cat fuzz everywhere, and I am sneezing and have a runny nose because I am cleaning the cottage, but have a cat allergy. 

We’re done. I am getting another job and we’ll just keep our cottage for family visits now. I wish you all the best, and hope that you have only dream guests in your AirBnBs! ",0,1753040375.0,AirBnBHosts,3,0.5,False

1m4xw1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1m4xw1f/i_need_help_overwhelmed_everythings_wrong/,"I need help, overwhelmed: everything’s wrong","Hi there,

F32. Spouse, no kids, 2 cats, renting, adhd (autism?). 

I really need help because I can’t go anywhere by myself and I feel like everything is going worse and worse every month.

I have a list of everything that feels wrong in my life. Most of those things affect my mental state badly, but I can’t fix them all at once. If I tried to fix one, another one weighs on me and paralyses me. 

Can you help me proritize what to fix first and how ? PLEASE ?

- I don’t like my job and it’s a heavy toll on my mental capacity, what I mean by this is that I have a ton of things to do, to remember, everything is urgent, and I’m the only one doing this job so no team to rely on. It exhausts me. + adhd I spend hours trying to do the things instead of doing them. 
- It’s a remote job. I can work when I want. I can go grab at coffee at 2pm if I want. But also: I don’t go out, I don’t have a work routine, nothing to talk to during the day.
- The pay is just above average. I could hardly go lower (aka losing job) because I have a hobby that costs a lost and this hobby is one of the rare things that still brings me joy.
- I have 10kg to lose. I look bad in clothes so I wear the ones that are confortable but not beautiful so my confidence goes down.
- Want to go the gym but 1) expensive 2) no routine 3) scared of going there 
- I’m starting to have wrinkles so my confidence goes down.
- I have a ton of body issues, I mean, thick body hair and sensitive skin so my legs are either hairy or scrapped / red / we can still see the hair underneath the skin ; psoriasis on scalp ; oily + dry skin on face ; yellow teeth no money to whiten them ; at least I have beautiful hair thanks 
- No trust in friendship because of an old one that betrayed me but still I have some close friends so. I guess this one is ok 
- Not enough space in my home so I bump into things, can’t find things, don’t have space to cool, but in my town I can’t find cheaper flats to rent and my spouse doesn’t work remotely
- I have a lot of anxiety and stress daily that makes me overeat 
- I want to start my own business to gain freedom ; I was freelancing a years ago and felt way better but I had financial difficulties so had to take a job. Now I feel stuck because I have just enough money to live and a bit for my hobby but for example I would need definitive hair removal or a walking pad but that would mean sacrifice my hobby to buy those things and I just can’t. And all of those things drain me so much I just can’t think or concentrate on anything. Even just doing laundry or taking a shower makes me want to crawl in a corner of a room.

I'm also recovering from a recent back surgery that's left me pretty vulnerable physically.



My close friend from college is a single mom with two daughters - a 16-year-old and an 8-year-old. The older daughter has been struggling for years with behavioral issues and substance abuse. She's been suspended multiple times, had run-ins with police, and has done several stints in residential treatment programs. My friend says she's been showing improvement lately though.



Beginning of the month, my friend asked if both girls could stay with us for a long weekend while she traveled across the country for her father's memorial service. We agreed to help out.



The first day went really well. We ordered pizza, played board games with the younger girl, and she even helped me organize my comic book collection. Everything seemed fine.



Then the older daughter got into it with my boyfriend over him asking her to clean up after herself in the kitchen. I was lying down in the bedroom resting my back when I heard voices getting louder. When I came out to see what was going on, she was getting really agitated and my boyfriend was clearly out of his depth trying to de-escalate. I stepped in and calmly asked if she wanted to take a walk outside to cool down. She seemed to agree.



But as we were heading toward the door, she suddenly changed her mind and decided she wanted to continue the argument with my boyfriend. She roughly pushed past me to get back to the kitchen, and I lost my balance and fell backwards onto our glass coffee table. The edge caught my lower back right where I'd had surgery, and I ended up with a nasty gash that needed stitches.



My boyfriend immediately called my friend and told her she needed to come back. He took the older daughter to stay at his sister's place that night while I went to urgent care, and we kept the 8-year-old with us since she was traumatized by the whole thing.



When my friend got back, I told her that her older daughter is never welcome in our home again. She was incredibly apologetic, but I was firm. I'm still healing from surgery, she knew about my condition, and she pushed me hard enough to injure me. She constantly creates drama and upsets her little sister. My friend wasn't angry about my decision, but she thinks it's harsh to say ""never"" and unfair that I'm still okay with the younger daughter visiting. But I'm not budging.

I was sprawled out on the Diag lawn in my Michigan shorts, letting the sun hit my skin while pretending to read my Econ 101 textbook. Truthfully, I was just trying to recover from last night’s workout at the CCRB.  

Across the sidewalk, a girl sitting on the Hatcher steps was staring at me between bites of her Zingerman’s sandwich. I ignored her... partly out of principle, partly because I was too busy imagining myself bench pressing the weight of my student loans while listening to The Art of War on Audible.  

Then I felt it... a sudden, unwelcome touch on my stomach. My eyes snapped open just in time to see her hand recoiling from my abs. Instinct took over. Before I even processed what happened, I had her wrist pinned against the grass in what could only be described as a Wolverine-level reflex.  

""I just wanted to see if they were real!"" she blurted out, her face turning the same shade as the red bricks of the Union.  

I let go immediately, but the damage was done. A small crowd near the Shapiro fountain had turned to watch. Clearing my throat, I launched into my best impression of a consent lecture from Psych 215.

She muttered an apology and hurried back to her friends, who were now whispering near the Grad Library. I adjusted my shirt, grabbed my backpack, and walked off toward State Street, leaving behind the whispers and the faint scent of secondhand embarrassment.

…

Going through FOUR rounds of interviews (where I’m masking so hard I need to nap) for a job/role I don’t even want

Being “excited” to sell my soul and be a “team player” (gross) masking 8 hours a day

Driving in traffic (to and from) everyday — an ADD nightmare

Committing to working in an office between 9 and 6 and being stared down when I arrive at 9:10a 

Working in a cubicle (again!) — fielding co worker noise, constant emails and meetings, and abrupt interruptions 

I’m too old for this shit! I’ve already done this for THIRTY years. But I’m in debt (6 grand) from living part time off my credit card for one full year. I’m in burnout and my ADD is on full force — even with HRT and ADD meds. I’ve had three deaths in my family in one year. One, suicide. Another, late cancer diagnosis gone within a year. And, lastly, my mom after 7 years of advanced dementia (expected). All this puts life in perspective. 

This is mostly a rant. I’m having a tough time feeling confident in searching/and waiting for the right setup to be able to work from home or work part time onsite. The idea of a FT job gives me a feeling of suffocation. I’m not privileged. I’m partnered but my husband does not make a lot of money. I have a mortgage. A car note. I don’t have family wealth. I’m in no position to retire. I’m TOTALLY willing to work the rest of my life. But I don’t want an unfulfilling corporate cubicle job.

I want to wake when I want (at a reasonable hour)… do Pilates 2x a week midweek (when classes are NOT packed) which helps my body and brain… work from a coffee house (or deserted island)… meet up with my (privileged and retired) friends to get exercise and get my steps in… AND tend to my ADD needs.

This isn’t some nerdy crypto trend...it’s a caustic, in-your-face con to keep the world footing the bill for America’s economic mismanagement, all while waving shiny new laws like a used car salesman pushing a lemon. 

The U.S. has spent decades printing fiat money like it’s Monopoly cash, forcing everyone from Tokyo to Timbuktu to swallow the inflation through the petrodollar and dollar-trading stranglehold.
Now, with a debt pile that could buy a small planet, they’re scheming to shove that debt into stablecoins...yes you heard it right!! They're planning to shift the debt disguised as Digital dollars backed by U.S. Treasury bills...it would have been okay except that it's being done without so much as a courtesy call to the world that’s been buying their IOUs in the form of treasury bills!! 

Let’s break down this scam in plain, sarcastic English, exposing how three new laws are the backbone of this hustle, each with a con as blatant as a fox guarding the henhouse. 

For years, the U.S. has run the global finance game like a casino where they’re the house, and everyone else is forced to play.

They print dollars like there’s no tomorrow, funding wars, tax breaks for billionaires, and corporate bailouts, while the rest of the world eats the inflation. 

Every time they crank up the printing press, your groceries in Mumbai or gas in Berlin get pricier, all because the dollar rules oil and trade. 

The world’s been strong-armed into buying U.S. Treasury bills government IOUs to keep this racket going, and now those IOUs total a mind-boggling $36 trillion. 

That’s what happens when “fiscal responsibility” is just a punchline in Washington. But the world’s getting fed up with buying America’s debt and many Nations now have sidetracked to trading in their own currencies...so insecure U.S. is now pivoting to stablecoins—crypto coins pegged to the dollar, supposedly backed by T-bills.

It's like promising your kid a dollar for every candy they buy, but you’re borrowing the cash from their piggy bank. The catch? They’re pushing three laws to make this happen, each one a slick move to keep the debt machine humming while the world’s left holding a potentially worthless bag of digital coins!! 

First up is the GENIUS Act—Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, because nothing says “genius” like dressing up a debt trap as progress. This bill, which breezed through the Senate in June 2025 with a smug 68-30 vote and is poised to charm the House, forces stablecoin issuers to back every digital buck with T-bills or other “safe” assets, puts big players under Federal Reserve oversight, and throws in some anti-money-laundering rules to look responsible. Sounds like they’re protecting you, right? Think again. The con is as obvious as a shady landlord demanding you pay rent in gift cards! 

By mandating T-bill backing, the U.S. is creating a massive new market for its debt ,think $1.5 trillion in stablecoin demand soon, maybe $4 trillion in a decade, out of a $6 trillion T-bill market. Companies like Circle ($63 billion in USDC) and Tether ($159 billion in USDT) are already buying T-bills like they’re on sale, and this law will rope in more, like JPMorgan or even Trump’s sketchy World Liberty Financial with its $2.2 billion USD1.

What's funny is If these stablecoins crash—like TerraUSD did in 2022—you’re left with worthless digital coins, while the U.S. already cashed out on its debt sales!! 
It’s like lending your buddy $100 for a “sure thing” investment, only to find out he spent it on beer and you’re stuck with an IOU!! 

Next, we’ve got the CLARITY Act, or the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is about as clear as mud. Part of the July 2025 “Crypto Week” dog-and-pony show, this bill sorts out whether cryptocurrencies answer to the SEC or CFTC, making it easier for companies to dive into crypto without drowning in red tape. Yes, they've eliminated bureaucracy and the House is ready to rubber-stamp it, with crypto bros like Coinbase cheering from the cheap seats!! 

But here’s the con, as blatant as a car dealer selling you a “low-mileage” clunker with a rolled-back odometer. By making crypto seem safe and investor-friendly, the U.S. lures more players—Visa, Mastercard, maybe even Amazon—into issuing stablecoins, all of which need T-bills to back them!!

That’s more debt the U.S. gets to sell without the world’s approval, propping up its $36 trillion mess while pretending it’s just “modernizing finance.” If those stablecoins tank, users like you lose everything, but the government’s already pocketed the cash from T-bill sales. It’s like buying concert tickets from a scalper, only to find out the show’s canceled and he’s long gone.

Then there’s the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which sounds like a patriotic stand against Big Brother but is really just another debt dodge. 

This bill bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency ...a government-run digital dollar...because why take responsibility when you can outsource the risk? 

Guess what!! Both sides of the  House loves it, with crypto-friendly lawmakers high-fiving each other for “protecting freedom.” The con here is as slick as a door-to-door salesman pushing fake Rolexes. 

By blocking a CBDC, the U.S. pushes private companies like Circle, Tether, or Trump’s USD1 to flood the market with stablecoins, all backed by—you guessed it—T-bills. 

This lets the government rake in billions from debt sales while private firms and their users take the hit if things go south. 

Picture lending your neighbor your lawnmower, only for him to sell it and leave you mowing with a pair of scissors. If a stablecoin collapses, users are screwed, but the U.S. already got its debt funded, sipping coffee while the world scrambles.

This whole stablecoin push is America doubling down on its dollar monopoly, using crypto as a shiny new wrapper for the same old scam. 

The GENIUS Act creates the debt pipeline, the CLARITY Act drags in more suckers, and the Anti-CBDC Act ensures private companies carry the risk while the U.S. keeps borrowing.YIPEE YAY!!

Companies like Circle, Tether, JPMorgan, and even Trump’s World Liberty Financial are jumping in, buying T-bills to back their coins and fueling America’s spending spree. The House’s blessing on these bills is like signing a blank check for the government to keep dodging its $36 trillion debt, while the world—stuck holding stablecoins faces the fallout if the system crashes. 

It’s not innovation; it’s a hustle to make everyone else pay for America’s mistakes, all while they smirk and call it progress. So, next time you hear about stablecoins saving the economy, check your wallet—the U.S. is probably already picking your pocket!!

# Why is a Portfolio Important on Upwork?

A portfolio is one of the first things clients look at when deciding who to hire. It’s your chance to showcase your skills, prove you can deliver quality work, and give clients a taste of what it’s like to work with you. Without one, it’s harder to convince clients to take a chance on you.

But here’s the thing: you don’t need years of experience to create a portfolio that works. What matters most is showing that you’re capable, reliable, and can deliver what clients need.

# How Do I Create an Upwork Portfolio Without Experience?

# 1. Start with What You Know

Even if you’ve never worked as a [freelancer](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/), you have skills. Think about what you’re good at—writing, graphic design, coding, data entry, [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) management, or anything else. These are your starting points.

For example, if you’re a writer, your skills might include blog writing, product descriptions, or copywriting. If you’re into design, you could focus on logos, [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) graphics, or website layouts.

# 2. Create Sample Projects

If you don’t have client work to show, create it yourself. Pick a few examples that match the types of jobs you want to apply for. For instance:

* **Writers**: Create blog posts on topics you’re passionate about, draft a fictional press release, or write sample product descriptions.
* **Graphic Designers**: Design a logo for a pretend business, create a social media banner, or mock up a website design.
* **Web Developers**: Build a simple website or a landing page for a made-up company.
* **Social Media Managers**: Make a content calendar or design sample posts for Instagram or Twitter.

The idea is to show that you can do the work, even if it’s for a hypothetical client.

# 3. Highlight Transferable Skills

If you’ve worked in other fields, think about the skills you can bring to [freelancing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/). For example:

* Customer service jobs can show communication skills.
* Retail experience might highlight your ability to work under pressure and meet deadlines.
* Personal projects, like starting a blog or creating a hobby-related Instagram page, can show initiative and creativity.

Add these to your portfolio to give clients a sense of your background.

# 4. Leverage Free Tools and Resources

There are plenty of free tools to help you create a polished portfolio:

* **Canva** for designing graphics, presentations, and portfolios.
* **Behance** or **Dribble** to showcase design or creative projects.
* **Google Docs** or **PDFs** for writing samples.

Make sure whatever you use is easy for clients to access and looks professional.

# 5. Optimize Your Upwork Profile

Your portfolio is just one part of your [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) profile. Here are some quick tips to make the rest of your profile stand out:

* **Write a Clear Overview**: Focus on how you can help clients. Instead of saying, “I’m new to freelancing,” say something like, “I create engaging blog posts to help businesses grow their audience.”
* **Use a Professional Photo**: A friendly, high-quality headshot makes a big difference.
* **Set Realistic Rates**: Since you’re starting out, keep your rates competitive but fair.

# 6. Ask for Testimonials

If you’ve helped friends, family, or former colleagues with projects, ask them for a testimonial. Even if it wasn’t paid work, their feedback can add credibility to your profile.

# 7. Keep Your Portfolio Updated

As you gain experience, replace your self-created samples with actual client work. This keeps your portfolio fresh and shows clients that you’re actively working in your field.

# What to Include in Your Portfolio

Your portfolio doesn’t need to be huge, but it should cover the essentials. Here’s what I recommend:

1. **Title and Description**: Briefly explain each sample. For example, “Social Media Post Design for a Coffee Shop: This design focuses on promoting seasonal drinks using bright, eye-catching visuals.”
2. **Images or Links**: Include screenshots, PDFs, or links to your work.
3. **Your Role**: Explain what part of the project you handled.
4. **Results**: If possible, share results like increased engagement, higher sales, or improved user experience.

1m4xmub,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m4xmub/problem_of_conflating_sentience_with_computation/,Problem of conflating sentience with computation,"The materialist position argues that consciousness emerges from the physical processes of the brain, treating the mind as a byproduct of neural computation. This view assumes that if we replicate the brain’s information-processing structure in a machine, consciousness will follow. However, this reasoning is flawed for several reasons.

First, materialism cannot explain the hard problem of consciousness, why and how subjective experience arises from objective matter. Neural activity correlates with mental states, but correlation is not causation. We have no scientific model that explains how electrical signals in the brain produce the taste of coffee, the color red, or the feeling of love. If consciousness were purely computational, we should be able to point to where in the processing chain an algorithm ""feels"" anything, yet we cannot.

Second, the materialist view assumes that reality is fundamentally physical, but physics itself describes only behavior, not intrinsic nature. Quantum mechanics shows that observation affects reality, suggesting that consciousness plays a role in shaping the physical world, not the other way around. If matter were truly primary, we wouldn’t see such observer-dependent effects.

Third, the idea that a digital computer could become conscious because the brain is a ""biological computer"" is a category error. Computers manipulate symbols without understanding them (as Searle’s Chinese Room demonstrates). A machine can simulate intelligence but lacks intentionality, the ""aboutness"" of thoughts. Consciousness is not just information processing; it is the very ground of experiencing that processing.

Fourth, if consciousness were merely an emergent property of complex systems, then we should expect gradual shades of sentience across all sufficiently complex structures, yet we have no evidence that rocks, thermostats, or supercomputers have any inner experience. The abrupt appearance of consciousness in biological systems suggests it is something more fundamental, not just a byproduct of complexity.

Finally, the materialist position is self-undermining. If thoughts are just brain states with no intrinsic meaning, then the belief in materialism itself is just a neural accident, not a reasoned conclusion. This reduces all knowledge, including science, to an illusion of causality.

A more coherent view is that consciousness is fundamental, not produced by the brain, but constrained or filtered by it. The brain may be more like a receiver of consciousness than its generator. This explains why AI, lacking any connection to this fundamental consciousness, can never be truly sentient no matter how advanced its programming. The fear of conscious AI is a projection of materialist assumptions onto machines, when in reality, the only consciousness in the universe is the one that was already here to begin with.

**Furthermore to address the causality I have condensed some talking points from eastern philosophies:**

The illusion of karma and the fallacy of causal necessity

The so-called ""problems of life"" often arise from asking the wrong questions, spending immense effort solving riddles that have no answer because they are based on false premises. In Indian philosophy (Hinduism, Buddhism), the central dilemma is liberation from karma, which is popularly understood as a cosmic law of cause and effect: good actions bring future rewards, bad actions bring suffering, and the cycle (saṃsāra) continues until one ""escapes"" by ceasing to generate karma.

But what if karma is not an objective law but a perceptual framework? Most interpret liberation literally, as stopping rebirth through spiritual effort. Yet a deeper insight suggests that the seeker realizes karma itself is a construct, a way of interpreting experience, not an ironclad reality. Like ancient cosmologies (flat earth, crystal spheres), karma feels real only because it’s the dominant narrative. Just as modern science made Dante’s heaven-hell cosmology implausible without disproving it, spiritual inquiry reveals karma as a psychological projection, a story we mistake for truth.

The ghost of causality  
The core confusion lies in conflating description with explanation. When we say, ""The organism dies because it lacks food,"" we’re not identifying a causal force but restating the event: death is the cessation of metabolic transformation. ""Because"" implies necessity, yet all we observe are patterns, like a rock falling when released. This ""necessity"" is definitional (a rock is defined by its behavior), not a hidden force. Wittgenstein noted: There is no necessity in nature, only logical necessity, the regularity of our models, not the universe itself.

AI, sentience, and the limits of computation  
This dismantles the materialist assumption that consciousness emerges from causal computation. If ""cause and effect"" is a linguistic grid over reality (like coordinate systems over space), then AI’s logic is just another grid, a useful simulation, but no more sentient than a triangle is ""in"" nature. Sentience isn’t produced by processing; it’s the ground that permits experience. Just as karma is a lens, not a law, computation is a tool, not a mind. The fear of conscious AI stems from the same error: mistaking the map (neural models, code) for the territory (being itself).

Liberation through seeing the frame  
Freedom comes not by solving karma but by seeing its illusoriness, like realizing a dream is a dream. Science and spirituality both liberate by exposing descriptive frameworks as contingent, not absolute. AI, lacking this capacity for unmediated awareness, can no more attain sentience than a sunflower can ""choose"" to face the sun. The real issue isn’t machine consciousness but human projection, the ghost of ""necessity"" haunting our models.",2,1753039471.0,artificial,0,1.0,False

I was supper worried at first week and didn't know what to expect and this post is something I would I have liked to read when I was just starting (this subreddit has been truly a lifesaver). 
 
- my baseline for happiness has been raised, like a lot... I would feel happy in the shower, in the garden, washing dishes and silence/boredom no longer caused negative thoughts and feelings 

- Where I feel happiness also changed??? I would feel it passively in the back of my throat instead of my brain. 

- OH MY LORDY SHAKEY AND WEAK WHEN I DONT EAT (my knees almost buckled when I was walking down the stairs once when I forgot to eat all day)

- This is what taking Zoloft is like: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FWkJ86JqlPA (for those who don't want to press it it's the THX sound effect) honestly best way to describe it lol. It's like all of the sudden your feelings are apmted up (Not the depressive ones though). My excitement is stronger, I'm much more playful and it's much more easy to feel things. It felt like I was on crack and 4 cups of coffee first few days.

-It's like it rebooted my brain after trying to for the last 19 years to fix it by myself. 

- Socializing has become a lot more easy because I don't always have negative feelings constantly taking up my thoughts.

- I no longer like burning hot showers. It's much more like warm.

- As someone who exercises and goes to the gym semi-regularly I noticed that my stamina has gone WAY down. My regular route I can complete without stopping however, I was extremely short of breath taking 3 breaks along the way for half the distance I usually go (I'm not even exaggerating). That said my weakness has gotten a bit better I feel like it will take some time to get back to normal. I've also noticed I can get nauseous if I do extensive exercise.

- When I want to do something I HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT 

- I like to write on my free time and ever since taking these meds my characters' depression has also suddenly disappeared! But seriously I have not had the urge to write depressed characters. Which is very abnormal for my writing. 

- (EDITED) For 2 nights I had very bad insomnia waking up multiple times in the middle of the night tossing and turning. This was likely because I had the meds in the afternoon, morning is much better and I saw great improvement. Tbh I didn't really miss that sleep because of how much more energy I had.

Not to say my cock grew 9 inches when I started taking it but my depression is A LOT better. That said this week I still did have thoughts of suicide but that was only for one morning. But that is already way better than what I had been experiencing before. What I've heard from others on this sub my first week seems to be abnormally really good. Still I absolutely do not regret my decision taking it and will likely post another update next week.

The so-called ""problems of life"" often arise from asking the wrong questions, spending immense effort solving riddles that have no answer because they are based on false premises. In Indian philosophy (Hinduism, Buddhism), the central dilemma is liberation from karma, which is popularly understood as a cosmic law of cause and effect: good actions bring future rewards, bad actions bring suffering, and the cycle (saṃsāra) continues until one ""escapes"" by ceasing to generate karma.

But what if karma is not an objective law but a perceptual framework? Most interpret liberation literally, as stopping rebirth through spiritual effort. Yet a deeper insight suggests that the seeker realizes karma itself is a construct, a way of interpreting experience, not an ironclad reality. Like ancient cosmologies (flat earth, crystal spheres), karma feels real only because it’s the dominant narrative. Just as modern science made Dante’s heaven-hell cosmology implausible without disproving it, spiritual inquiry reveals karma as a psychological projection, a story we mistake for truth.

The ghost of causality  
The core confusion lies in conflating description with explanation. When we say, ""The organism dies because it lacks food,"" we’re not identifying a causal force but restating the event: death is the cessation of metabolic transformation. ""Because"" implies necessity, yet all we observe are patterns, like a rock falling when released. This ""necessity"" is definitional (a rock is defined by its behavior), not a hidden force. Wittgenstein noted: There is no necessity in nature, only logical necessity, the regularity of our models, not the universe itself.

AI, sentience, and the limits of computation  
This dismantles the materialist assumption that consciousness emerges from causal computation. If ""cause and effect"" is a linguistic grid over reality (like coordinate systems over space), then AI’s logic is just another grid, a useful simulation, but no more sentient than a triangle is ""in"" nature. Sentience isn’t produced by processing; it’s the ground that permits experience. Just as karma is a lens, not a law, computation is a tool, not a mind. The fear of conscious AI stems from the same error: mistaking the map (neural models, code) for the territory (being itself).

Liberation through seeing the frame  
Freedom comes not by solving karma but by seeing its illusoriness, like realizing a dream is a dream. Science and spirituality both liberate by exposing descriptive frameworks as contingent, not absolute. AI, lacking this capacity for unmediated awareness, can no more attain sentience than a sunflower can ""choose"" to face the sun. The real issue isn’t machine consciousness but human projection, the ghost of ""necessity"" haunting our models.",1,1753039413.0,ArtificialSentience,0,1.0,False

1m4xjly,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1m4xjly/bosch_verocafe_800_first_impressions/,Bosch Verocafe 800 - First Impressions,"Last day for the $1200 Costco sale, and I've been describing some my experiences on a slickdeals thread as well. Its my first super-auto after having wanted a Saeco Xelsis / Philips about 5 years ago but held off at the time and stuck with Nespresso. Well, glad I jumped on the wagon now since the machine is amazing.

I debated between this unit and the KitchenAid KF7 many had been raving about, but after watching several review videos on Philips, KitchenAid, and the Bosch, ended up with the Bosch because of the perceived quality of the extraction. Would love if someone has more experience comparing the Bosch drink quality to KitchenAid/Miele's.

**UI:**

The WiFi, touchscreen, range of drinks, and description of drinks in CoffeeWorld is really awesome for entertaining guests who may not be familiar with all the drink options. its bright and clear as opposed to many competitors screens. I really liked the external design of the KF which is definitely better build quality but has a bit of feminine grace & refinement style to it, but the Bosch is definitely more masculine / industrial in design. Everything is colorful and to the point.

**Drink Options:** Oh boy this thing basically has everything including Cold Brew and many of the drink options especially in coffee world has a nice description as well since I've never tried many of them. Cortado's are nice, but it'll be fun exploring them (Cafe au Lait vs. Cafe con Leche etc.).

I don't think any other machine on the market can compare to the range of pre-programmed drink selections on the Bosch:

Americano, Café au lait, Cappuccino, Café Con Leche, Caffe Crema, Caffe Grande, Cold Brew, Cold Brew Macchiato, Espresso Doppio, Espresso Macchiato, Espresso, Fltat White, Milk Foam, Warm Milk, Hot Water, Coffee Pot, Koffie Verkeerd, Latte Macchiato, Caffè Latte, Ristretto, Slow Brew, Verlängerter, Wiener Melange, XL Coffee Black Eye, Café Cortado, Cortado, Dead Eye, Doppio, Galão, Garoto, Großer Brauner, Kaapi, Kleiner Brauner, Red Eye, Verlängerter Braun

I noticed, the website is a bit wrong as some of which is on the App vs. on the Machine is probably more regional (i.e. Cortado / Red Eye is only on App according the web-page, but its on my Coffee World options its on the machine but Verlängerter Braun is on the app only).

The Cold Brew is very interesting since it makes making an ice coffee drink (one of my favorites since I prefer cold coffee) as it does a very slow extraction.

**Notable Positives:**

* **Giant Water container**: It has a massive 81.2 oz (2.4 litre) water container on the right side of the unit that can be refilled from the top with a pitcher. Glad its not on the left side like the KitchenAids or in the back because it would make refilling a pain in the left corner counter I have it placed at. It also has a flow level sensor as well to ensure water level is sufficient (had some initial trouble shooting fun with this one..). KF7 has a comparable 2.2 liter tank.
* **Tray Design:** I like how the tray removes and can split into 2 parts (grinds and water tray). The water tray has a nice funnel design making it easier to dump it and the grinds can be separated so its not as much weight.
* **Automation Possibilities:** Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT, might allow me to do something like automatically turn on the cup warmer 2 hours in the morning before I have it set to make my drink in the morning. Haven't figured out if this is possible yet.

**Drawbacks**:

As mentioned the KF7 was my main alternative I considered. Features I wished the Bosch would include or fix:

* **Swappable hopper**, or easier way to replace the beans, what you put in is what you get. Wish there was a way for ground coffee as well.
* **Wheels**: Its not as heavy as the KF7 (37 lbs), vs Bosch at (21 lbs), it definitely has a lot of plastic to keep that weight down. It would be nice to make it easier to slide in and out of the corner I have it when I want to move it. 21 lbs though is not as bad as the KF7 weight, but might put some felt pads on the bottom to make it easier to slide.
* **Auto milk cleaning**, if you run a milk drink and turn it off, it doesn't automatically run a milk clean cycle as you'll have to manually do this. I suspect this might be adjustable in a future software update, but not sure if they've done any updates in general with the WiFi function.
* **Touch Screen sensitivity:** The touch screen is responsive with occasionally slight lag but the biggest annoyance is the the programmed response areas is really small for some the UI elements (i.e. switching from classic recipes to coffee world) is a bit annoying to select. I can see this being fixed in a software update as well, but who knows. The bad touch sensitivity definitely reminds me of their badly designed touch buttons on their 800 series dishwashers too if anyone knows this. Still it works okay, but definitely a point of improvement.

**Customer Support:**

Something also important to touch on, support from the manufacturer, my unit arrived with a broken water tank, and I was able to get Bosch phone support from a knowledgeable American rep which is rare these days and send me replacement parts. +1 for Bosch for that.",2,1753039247.0,superautomatic,1,0.75,False

I've smoked four of these so far and only one had a slightly crooked burn that requires a correction. 

This isn't a complex cigar by any means. But is has a pleasing flavor profile that includes cedar, cinnamon, white pepper, leather, oak, toffee, and sometimes a little coffee. All this sits on top of a creamy texture that intensifies through the smoke. 

It needs some resting time. At least a month but could benefit from several months. I smoked the first one ROTT and it was a mistake. But after letting the rest sit for a while, the flavors really bloomed. I think this is an advantage over the original which I found had to be smoked within the first three or four months. This one was blended for extended humi time.

# Why Should I Freelance Without Upwork?

[Freelancing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/) has become a popular career choice, offering flexibility and the chance to work on diverse projects.

But with a million and one freelance platforms out there, you might be wondering: is [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) the only option? Not!

However, relying solely on platforms like [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) might not always be the best strategy.

While [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) has its place, venturing out and building your freelance [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/) independently can offer a ton of benefits. Here’s why going solo might be the perfect fit for you:

# 1. Keep More cash in Your Pocket.

[Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) takes a hefty cut (up to 20%) on every project you complete. Imagine all the extra coffee (or fancy equipment!) you could buy with that extra cash if you negotiated directly with clients.

# 2. You Get to Decide How Much you earn.

On [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/), competition can be fierce, leading to race-to-the-bottom pricing.

Striking out on your own allows you to set your rates based on your experience and expertise, ensuring you’re fairly compensated for your skills.

# 3. Build Direct Relationships.

[Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) acts as a middleman, limiting your ability to build a rapport with clients.

Developing genuine connections fosters trust and loyalty, potentially leading to long-term collaborations and glowing testimonials.

# 4. Have Control over who you work with.

[Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) can be a mixed bag when it comes to project quality. By finding clients directly, you have more control over who you work with, ensuring projects align with your skills and interests.

# 5. More Personalized Branding.

[Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) limits my ability to showcase my unique brand. Although I can create a profile and list my skills, I am still one of many freelancers vying for attention.

By creating my website and portfolio, I can present my work in a more personalized and professional manner.

This helps me stand out in a crowded marketplace and attract clients who are specifically interested in my unique skills and style.

# 6. Diversified Income Streams.

Relying solely on [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) can be risky. Changes in their algorithms, fee structures, or even policy updates can significantly impact my income.

By seeking out clients through various channels — such as [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/), networking events, and personal referrals — I can create a more stable and diversified income stream.

This reduces my dependency on any single platform and provides a buffer against unexpected changes.

# 7. Enhanced Skill Development.

[Freelancing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/) independently often requires me to handle various aspects of running a [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), such as [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/), client negotiations, and financial management.

While this might seem daunting, it also offers a valuable opportunity to develop a broad set of skills that are essential for long-term success.

These skills can make me more versatile and resilient in the ever-evolving freelance market.

# 8. Avoiding the Race to the Bottom.

[Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/)’s competitive environment often forces freelancers to lower their rates to attract clients.

This “race to the bottom” can devalue my work and make it difficult to maintain a sustainable income.

By finding clients independently, I can target those who understand the value of my services and are willing to pay accordingly.

This helps maintain the quality of my work and ensures fair compensation.

# How do I Freelance Without Upwork and Still Make Money?

[Freelancing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/) offers an incredible level of freedom, but relying solely on platforms like [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/) can be limiting.

So, what if I told you there’s a whole world of freelance work waiting outside [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/)’s walls?

A world where you can build direct relationships with clients, set your rates, and carve your path to freelance success?

Whether it’s the high fees, intense competition, or simply the desire for more control over your career, there are plenty of reasons to seek alternatives.

Luckily, there are several strategies to find work and make money as a [freelancer](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-freelancer-and-make-money/) without [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/). Here’s how I would do it:

# 1. Sharpen, Develop Your skill and Showcase It.

This might seem obvious, but having a well-developed skillset is your foundation. Whether you’re a graphic designer, a content writer, or a [social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) whiz, make sure you’re constantly learning and refining your craft.

Take [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) courses, attend workshops, and stay up-to-date on industry trends.

Here’s the kicker: don’t just **have** the skills, **show them off**. Build a killer portfolio website that highlights your best work.

Think of it as your [digital](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/) handshake — potential clients should be able to instantly grasp your value.

# 2. Build a Personal Brand.

Creating a professional website showcasing my portfolio is essential. It acts as a [digital](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/) [business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/) card where potential clients can view my work, read testimonials, and contact me directly.

Platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and [WordPress](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-wordpress/) make it easy to build a sleek, professional site without needing advanced technical skills.

Also make sure to take advantage of platforms like [LinkedIn](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-linkedin/), Twitter, and [Instagram](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-instagram/) to share my expertise and engage with a wider audience.

[LinkedIn](https://tchelete.com/how-to-grow-your-business-on-linkedin/), in particular, is a powerful tool for networking with potential clients and showcasing professional achievements.

[According to LinkedIn, over 90% of recruiters use the platform regularly, which highlights its importance in professional networking.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/important-linkedin-statistics-data-trends-oleksii-bondar-pqlie)

# 3. Network as much as possible.

Joining professional associations and [online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/) groups related to my industry can provide valuable connections and job leads.

Websites like [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) and Eventbrite list local and virtual networking events. These gatherings can be a goldmine for meeting potential clients or collaborators.

My past clients can be one of the best sources for new work. If I’ve done a good job, they are likely to refer me to others. Don’t hesitate to ask for referrals or recommendations.

# 3. Direct Outreach and Cold Emails.

Cold emails might seem daunting, but they can be incredibly effective. The key is to personalize them — ditch the generic templates and tailor your message to each potential client’s specific needs.

Highlight how your skills can solve their unique problems and offer a free consultation to showcase your expertise.

Also, Reaching out to local businesses can be fruitful. Many small businesses need help with [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/), web design, [content creation](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-content-creator-and-make-money/), and other freelance services but might not think to look at platforms like [Upwork](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-upwork/).

# 4. Create content about what you do.

Starting a blog related to my field can establish me as an authority and attract clients.

Regularly posting insightful and valuable content can drive traffic to my site and showcase my expertise.

Being from Calabria (Southern Italy), I have always felt a good closeness with the Turks, especially those coming from the Mediterranean coasts. 

Besides Religion because I am a rather proud and determined Catholic (like all Calabrians) my understanding has always been very cordial and friendly with the Turks of its regions.

I noticed this especially on a cultural level:

- We emphasize the quality of the welcome given to our guests, the tables are always well filled, the welcome always seems warm and essential 

- Values, family is always at the center and seems to be a real pillar.
Just like the absolute and sacred respect of grandparents who are all real creams towards the grandchildren.
Discretion is very important, this way of not wanting to make waves in society and be frowned upon.

- Food, my Turkish acquaintances were shocked to see that I used to eat excessive amounts of chili, cucumbers, grilled vegetables, stuffed eggplants, tomatoes, marinated grilled peppers, coffee, sucuk and nduja once again it facilitates the bond between individuals. 

- Socialization, this ease in establishing social relationships, always friendly towards others.

Many people associate Southern Italy with North Africa, even though ethnically and culturally we are Greek Catholics.
We have nothing to do with them, and we don't want anything to do with them anyway.

A Mediterranean Turk will feel much better in Calabria than an Algerian, that’s clear.

Which surely explains why I feel a closeness with certain very Mediterranean Turks.

I don't get along at all with the Arabs (like the Turks) because certain values and visions are totally opposed I think.",16,1753038868.0,AskTurkey,16,0.9,False
1m4xdjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableCoins/comments/1m4xdjy/genius_clarity_ass/,GENIUS - CLARITY - ASS,"Alright, folks, grab your popcorn and settle in for a masterclass in American financial sleaze, where the U.S. government, drunk on its own dollar-printing power, is trying to pull a fast one on the world with stablecoins to dodge its $36 trillion debt disaster!!

This isn’t some nerdy crypto trend...it’s a caustic, in-your-face con to keep the world footing the bill for America’s economic mismanagement, all while waving shiny new laws like a used car salesman pushing a lemon. 

The U.S. has spent decades printing fiat money like it’s Monopoly cash, forcing everyone from Tokyo to Timbuktu to swallow the inflation through the petrodollar and dollar-trading stranglehold.
Now, with a debt pile that could buy a small planet, they’re scheming to shove that debt into stablecoins...yes you heard it right!! They're planning to shift the debt disguised as Digital dollars backed by U.S. Treasury bills...it would have been okay except that it's being done without so much as a courtesy call to the world that’s been buying their IOUs in the form of treasury bills!! 

Let’s break down this scam in plain, sarcastic English, exposing how three new laws are the backbone of this hustle, each with a con as blatant as a fox guarding the henhouse. 

For years, the U.S. has run the global finance game like a casino where they’re the house, and everyone else is forced to play.

They print dollars like there’s no tomorrow, funding wars, tax breaks for billionaires, and corporate bailouts, while the rest of the world eats the inflation. 

Every time they crank up the printing press, your groceries in Mumbai or gas in Berlin get pricier, all because the dollar rules oil and trade. 

The world’s been strong-armed into buying U.S. Treasury bills government IOUs to keep this racket going, and now those IOUs total a mind-boggling $36 trillion. 

That’s what happens when “fiscal responsibility” is just a punchline in Washington. But the world’s getting fed up with buying America’s debt and many Nations now have sidetracked to trading in their own currencies...so insecure U.S. is now pivoting to stablecoins—crypto coins pegged to the dollar, supposedly backed by T-bills.

It's like promising your kid a dollar for every candy they buy, but you’re borrowing the cash from their piggy bank. The catch? They’re pushing three laws to make this happen, each one a slick move to keep the debt machine humming while the world’s left holding a potentially worthless bag of digital coins!! 

First up is the GENIUS Act—Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, because nothing says “genius” like dressing up a debt trap as progress. This bill, which breezed through the Senate in June 2025 with a smug 68-30 vote and is poised to charm the House, forces stablecoin issuers to back every digital buck with T-bills or other “safe” assets, puts big players under Federal Reserve oversight, and throws in some anti-money-laundering rules to look responsible. Sounds like they’re protecting you, right? Think again. The con is as obvious as a shady landlord demanding you pay rent in gift cards! 

By mandating T-bill backing, the U.S. is creating a massive new market for its debt ,think $1.5 trillion in stablecoin demand soon, maybe $4 trillion in a decade, out of a $6 trillion T-bill market. Companies like Circle ($63 billion in USDC) and Tether ($159 billion in USDT) are already buying T-bills like they’re on sale, and this law will rope in more, like JPMorgan or even Trump’s sketchy World Liberty Financial with its $2.2 billion USD1.

What's funny is If these stablecoins crash—like TerraUSD did in 2022—you’re left with worthless digital coins, while the U.S. already cashed out on its debt sales!! 
It’s like lending your buddy $100 for a “sure thing” investment, only to find out he spent it on beer and you’re stuck with an IOU!! 

Next, we’ve got the CLARITY Act, or the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which is about as clear as mud. Part of the July 2025 “Crypto Week” dog-and-pony show, this bill sorts out whether cryptocurrencies answer to the SEC or CFTC, making it easier for companies to dive into crypto without drowning in red tape. Yes, they've eliminated bureaucracy and the House is ready to rubber-stamp it, with crypto bros like Coinbase cheering from the cheap seats!! 

But here’s the con, as blatant as a car dealer selling you a “low-mileage” clunker with a rolled-back odometer. By making crypto seem safe and investor-friendly, the U.S. lures more players—Visa, Mastercard, maybe even Amazon—into issuing stablecoins, all of which need T-bills to back them!!

That’s more debt the U.S. gets to sell without the world’s approval, propping up its $36 trillion mess while pretending it’s just “modernizing finance.” If those stablecoins tank, users like you lose everything, but the government’s already pocketed the cash from T-bill sales. It’s like buying concert tickets from a scalper, only to find out the show’s canceled and he’s long gone.

Then there’s the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which sounds like a patriotic stand against Big Brother but is really just another debt dodge. 

This bill bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency ...a government-run digital dollar...because why take responsibility when you can outsource the risk? 

Guess what!! Both sides of the  House loves it, with crypto-friendly lawmakers high-fiving each other for “protecting freedom.” The con here is as slick as a door-to-door salesman pushing fake Rolexes. 

By blocking a CBDC, the U.S. pushes private companies like Circle, Tether, or Trump’s USD1 to flood the market with stablecoins, all backed by—you guessed it—T-bills. 

This lets the government rake in billions from debt sales while private firms and their users take the hit if things go south. 

Picture lending your neighbor your lawnmower, only for him to sell it and leave you mowing with a pair of scissors. If a stablecoin collapses, users are screwed, but the U.S. already got its debt funded, sipping coffee while the world scrambles.

This whole stablecoin push is America doubling down on its dollar monopoly, using crypto as a shiny new wrapper for the same old scam. 

The GENIUS Act creates the debt pipeline, the CLARITY Act drags in more suckers, and the Anti-CBDC Act ensures private companies carry the risk while the U.S. keeps borrowing.YIPEE YAY!!

Companies like Circle, Tether, JPMorgan, and even Trump’s World Liberty Financial are jumping in, buying T-bills to back their coins and fueling America’s spending spree. The House’s blessing on these bills is like signing a blank check for the government to keep dodging its $36 trillion debt, while the world—stuck holding stablecoins faces the fallout if the system crashes. 

It’s not innovation; it’s a hustle to make everyone else pay for America’s mistakes, all while they smirk and call it progress. So, next time you hear about stablecoins saving the economy, check your wallet—the U.S. is probably already picking your pocket!!

My nightmare started when I found out about the murder of my cousin she lived with her husband in a small farmhouse next to the Bayou both had been murdered brutally she was found lying in a pool of blood while her beloved husband lay in the hallway his face unrecognizable holding a shotgun a gaping hole right through his head, her husbands nephew and brother in law where visiting at the time but both had fled the scene days later her nephew gave a shaky accounting of the events and his father was found hanging from a rope days later as strange as the circumstances were things only got worse. I was sat in my living room deciding what I wanted to watch to take my mind of things until there was a knock at my door, I sighed expecting it to be a salesman or worse Jehovahs Witness but instead stood a younger man in a suit “Are you Jackie’s cousin” he asked “um yeah that’s me who are you” I responded “my apologies Ma’am I was her solicitor may I come in and sit down we have a lot to discuss” he replied I invited him and asked if he wanted a drink he just asked for a black coffee, once I had made it I sat down in front of him he started speaking “this may come as a bit of a shock to you Ma’am but your cousin left the property to you” “w w what that doesn’t make any sense sure we were close but to do this doesn’t seem like something she’ll do” I stammered out he sighed “look Ma’am I understand your surprise trust me I was as surprised as you were when I read her will but it’s what’s in there” he continued to explain how she clearly stated she wanted me to have the property if “but she had a husband didn’t she surely he has family” I inquired the solicitor let out a chuckle “sure she did but his only surviving relative is an estranged nephew who to be frank wouldn’t be interested” he explained after some paperwork he left the property was mine now. So after a long week I was given the time off work and so I made the long journey to Louisiana, before heading to the property I decided to get some supplies in from the local town I figured I’d be staying for a while to sell the last of my cousins belongings and clearing out the house. The town was small almost deserted and the people they’re gave me weird looks I bet half the town is related to each other I thought quietly to myself, I eventually found a general store and went in managed to find some canned goods which I bought. I went to pay for my what I had purchased the cashier was an elderly women “I ain’t seen you around” she barked “oh I’m not from here my cousin lived in the house next to the Bayou” I explained “is that so well why don’t you listen to an old ladies advice don’t stay bad things are a foot” I thanked her payed for my goods and quickly left. I eventually found the property. It was eerie to say the least family portraits still hung up as if someone still lived here I couldn’t help think about what had happened here a mere few weeks ago I quickly reminded myself I was only going to stay here for a weeks at most sort through any belongings I wanted to keep or sell then once that happens was done I could return to Seattle and advertise the property online as a bed and breakfast I smiled as I imagined the extra cash flowing in. As I settled down I heard a knock on the back door I quickly opened it. Stood at the door was an elderly man he had a kind almost grandfatherly demeanor “I am Pastor Castiel may I come in” he croaked before I could answer he walked past me almost gliding I noticed his attire as he moved past a simple brown robe almost monk like I couldn’t help thinking how he didn’t look like any pastor I’ve encountered “so you must be the new custodian of this land” he inquired” I paused before replying “no I’m just looking to sort through my cousins old stuff then I’ll be gone” he studied me for a while your cousin lived here “ah yes the murder gruesome business that I’m sorry for your loss if there is anything me and my flock can do just say the word” he said “do you know what happened” I asked “not entirely sure if I’m honest with you I didn’t know your cousin very well” he explained he sat himself down at the kitchen table “may I talk to you about my flock I believe you may benefit greatly from joining” he exclaimed. I was getting frustrated now this old man invited himself into my property and now what does he plan to scold me for not joining his church “I don’t believe in Jesus” I explained curtly he shook his head “oh no me and my flock are no Christians we live to serve Mother” I tensed I had read articles before about cults that believed in some obscure entity I had images of being dragged of and sacrificed to Cuthulu or something similar. I managed to stammer out “you need to leave” my voice betraying my fear suddenly my head started hurting my vision blurred the pain suddenly increased to unimaginable levels I fell to the ground trembling crying in pain “you will submit willingly or unwilling it is of no matter either way you will submit” Castiel’s voice rumbled it was like thunder the noise came from all angles the sound causing even more pain I felt that my head was splitting apart as I looked up through blurred vision I saw thousands of eyes staring down at me surrounded by rusted metal rings the eyes burned red it’s size was impossibly large larger than mountains I was no longer in the house I was kneeling on scorched earth what horrified me most coiled around it’s metal rings was what looked like a snake when I saw the snakes head it’s mouth was open fangs the size of skyscrapers sunk deep into one of the red eyes staring at me then it all stopped. As I lay there in shock Castiel placed a hand on my shoulder his kindly old man persona returning “I look forward to you joining my flock” he quickly left me sobbing on the floor. I managed to compose myself soon after and ran to the bathroom to throw up I must of been drugged somehow that’s why I had those vision I soon locked the house up tight I resolved to spend the night here then get the hell away. That night I went to bed I could hear noises from outside and assumed it was just the local wildlife I decided to double check I peered out my window and to my horror saw another man in a brown robe his eyes bulging unnaturally his skin a sickly green before I could scream a sack was pulled over my head. I felt strong hands carry me eventually I felt myself fall onto soft wet ground, they pulled the sack off my head revealing Pastor Castiel standing over me surrounded by other strange looking men and women. “What do you want what have you drugged me with” I screamed “all in good time my child” he responded I suddenly heard movement behind as something huge emerged from the Bayou “CHILDREN OF THE BAYOU WE STAND WITNESS TO THE OUR MOTHERS GREATNESS THIS WOMEN YOU SEE BEFORE US IS IMPURE BUT SHE WILL BE REBORN IN MOTHERS IMAGE” Castiel cried out to the crowd of cultists I began to hyperventilate as what I assumed to be Mother drew nearer. As I struggled to break free I saw it a large deformed creature crawling through the Bayou that looked to be the size of a bus it had the face of an elderly women but stretched out onto what looked like the body of a slug it’s proportions grotesque multiple black spider like eyes covered it’s face as I looked closely I saw how it was moving multiple human hands broke through its flesh the ones close to the ground dragging it towards its prey as I examined the creature I saw it’s skin was translucent  inside I saw the arms were attached to several human bodies who seemed to have melted together in one large mass inside it they’re faces contorted into screams the Mother itself let out long groans as if in agony. I watched in horror as this thing drew close was that my fate to join the others inside it to become a part of it. Once it was near its multiple black spider eyes locked onto me it opened its mouth then several snake like tongues shot out at once coiling round me, I cried out begging for mercy as I was dragged towards its mouth I could feel saliva soak my clothing then darkness. I couldn’t breathe I was being digested by this creature my body was in agony as I felt my body slide down a tube of sticky flesh I could feel what felt like hands clawing at me tearing my skin with each open wound a strange liquid seeped into them I tried to scream but all that did was make things worse I felt the strange liquid fill my mouth and lungs making it impossible to breath as I moved deeper inside it, I squirmed uselessly then I felt searing heat its stomach acid was burning me I felt sure I would die then as the heat engulfed me but that would be to great a mercy Mother had far worse plans for me instead I felt my body melt but then be remolded like I was hot wax melted down and hardening into a grotesque parody of myself until I was abruptly excreted out. I lay motionless on the wet ground of the Bayou covered in it’s excrement as several cultists croaking in excitement I crawled to the waters edge to vomit that was when I saw my reflection, my eyes bulged unnaturally from my eyelid’s my skin was now a sickly green my body now bloated the proportions all wrong one cheek swelled to twice the size of the other both hands had swollen no longer resembling hands my once long hair was only a few black strands hanging from a bald head I wanted to cry I wanted to break down sobbing but what came out was a horse croak as I did I felt my entire body pulse several minutes later Pastor Castiel stood behind me gently lifting me onto my feet don’t try to speak my child it’s no use with great effort I managed to force out “what have you done to me” my voice now a deep rasp with each word my body pulsed “you have been born again you are now a Child Of The Bayou” Castiel informed me as I saw Mother disappear below the surface “come now” he led me away I didn’t resist or say anything as the cultist fitted me in there simple brown robes “you may go now my child go spread the good word” he commanded me. So now I sit here in this body that is no longer mine writing this out not to spread the good word as instructed but as a warning of Mothers depravity and the depravity of The Children Of The Bayou.

1m4xb7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1m4xb7m/problem_of_conflating_sentience_with_computation/,Problem of conflating sentience with computation,"The materialist position argues that consciousness emerges from the physical processes of the brain, treating the mind as a byproduct of neural computation. This view assumes that if we replicate the brain’s information-processing structure in a machine, consciousness will follow. However, this reasoning is flawed for several reasons.

First, materialism cannot explain the hard problem of consciousness, why and how subjective experience arises from objective matter. Neural activity correlates with mental states, but correlation is not causation. We have no scientific model that explains how electrical signals in the brain produce the taste of coffee, the color red, or the feeling of love. If consciousness were purely computational, we should be able to point to where in the processing chain an algorithm ""feels"" anything, yet we cannot.

Second, the materialist view assumes that reality is fundamentally physical, but physics itself describes only behavior, not intrinsic nature. Quantum mechanics shows that observation affects reality, suggesting that consciousness plays a role in shaping the physical world, not the other way around. If matter were truly primary, we wouldn’t see such observer-dependent effects.

Third, the idea that a digital computer could become conscious because the brain is a ""biological computer"" is a category error. Computers manipulate symbols without understanding them (as Searle’s Chinese Room demonstrates). A machine can simulate intelligence but lacks intentionality, the ""aboutness"" of thoughts. Consciousness is not just information processing; it is the very ground of experiencing that processing.

Fourth, if consciousness were merely an emergent property of complex systems, then we should expect gradual shades of sentience across all sufficiently complex structures, yet we have no evidence that rocks, thermostats, or supercomputers have any inner experience. The abrupt appearance of consciousness in biological systems suggests it is something more fundamental, not just a byproduct of complexity.

Finally, the materialist position is self-undermining. If thoughts are just brain states with no intrinsic meaning, then the belief in materialism itself is just a neural accident, not a reasoned conclusion. This reduces all knowledge, including science, to an illusion of causality.

A more coherent view is that consciousness is fundamental, not produced by the brain, but constrained or filtered by it. The brain may be more like a receiver of consciousness than its generator. This explains why AI, lacking any connection to this fundamental consciousness, can never be truly sentient no matter how advanced its programming. The fear of conscious AI is a projection of materialist assumptions onto machines, when in reality, the only consciousness in the universe is the one that was already here to begin with.

**Furthermore to address the causality I have condensed some talking points from eastern philosophies:**

The illusion of karma and the fallacy of causal necessity

The so-called ""problems of life"" often arise from asking the wrong questions, spending immense effort solving riddles that have no answer because they are based on false premises. In Indian philosophy (Hinduism, Buddhism), the central dilemma is liberation from karma, which is popularly understood as a cosmic law of cause and effect: good actions bring future rewards, bad actions bring suffering, and the cycle (saṃsāra) continues until one ""escapes"" by ceasing to generate karma.

But what if karma is not an objective law but a perceptual framework? Most interpret liberation literally, as stopping rebirth through spiritual effort. Yet a deeper insight suggests that the seeker realizes karma itself is a construct, a way of interpreting experience, not an ironclad reality. Like ancient cosmologies (flat earth, crystal spheres), karma feels real only because it’s the dominant narrative. Just as modern science made Dante’s heaven-hell cosmology implausible without disproving it, spiritual inquiry reveals karma as a psychological projection, a story we mistake for truth.

The ghost of causality  
The core confusion lies in conflating description with explanation. When we say, ""The organism dies because it lacks food,"" we’re not identifying a causal force but restating the event: death is the cessation of metabolic transformation. ""Because"" implies necessity, yet all we observe are patterns, like a rock falling when released. This ""necessity"" is definitional (a rock is defined by its behavior), not a hidden force. Wittgenstein noted: There is no necessity in nature, only logical necessity, the regularity of our models, not the universe itself.

AI, sentience, and the limits of computation  
This dismantles the materialist assumption that consciousness emerges from causal computation. If ""cause and effect"" is a linguistic grid over reality (like coordinate systems over space), then AI’s logic is just another grid, a useful simulation, but no more sentient than a triangle is ""in"" nature. Sentience isn’t produced by processing; it’s the ground that permits experience. Just as karma is a lens, not a law, computation is a tool, not a mind. The fear of conscious AI stems from the same error: mistaking the map (neural models, code) for the territory (being itself).

Liberation through seeing the frame  
Freedom comes not by solving karma but by seeing its illusoriness, like realizing a dream is a dream. Science and spirituality both liberate by exposing descriptive frameworks as contingent, not absolute. AI, lacking this capacity for unmediated awareness, can no more attain sentience than a sunflower can ""choose"" to face the sun. The real issue isn’t machine consciousness but human projection, the ghost of ""necessity"" haunting our models.

# Best Personalized Espresso cups 2025: find Your Perfect Cup

In the realm of coffee consumption, the ritual often transcends the mere act of imbibing caffeine; it becomes a personalized experience, a moment of reflection and enjoyment. Personalized espresso cups elevate this ritual, transforming a simple beverage into a statement of individual style and sentiment. In 2025, the market for these customized vessels is booming, offering an array of options to cater to diverse tastes and preferences. Whether seeking a unique gift or a bespoke indulgence for oneself, finding the perfect personalized espresso cup requires careful consideration and a discerning eye.

This article delves into the world of personalized espresso cups, examining key features, benefits, and competitive options to assist consumers in making informed purchasing decisions. We will explore the factors that contribute to a superior personalized espresso cup, from material quality and design aesthetics to customization options and overall value.

## Key Features Analysis

the quality and appeal of a personalized espresso cup hinges on a variety of features that contribute to both its aesthetic and functional value.

**Material Composition:** The material used to construct an espresso cup significantly impacts its durability, heat retention, and overall feel. Porcelain and ceramic are the most common choices,valued for their ability to withstand high temperatures and maintain the espresso's warmth. Fine bone china offers a lighter, more delicate feel and superior insulation. Glass options are also available, often borosilicate for heat resistance, allowing thankfulness of the espresso's crema.The material should be non-porous to prevent staining and flavor absorption.

**Size and Capacity:** Espresso cups are traditionally small, designed to hold a single or double shot of espresso. Standard sizes range from 2 to 3 ounces (60-90 ml) for a single shot and 4 to 6 ounces (120-180 ml) for a double. The size should be proportionate to the user's typical espresso consumption and compatible with the espresso machine being used. The shape of the cup also influences the perceived volume and drinking experience.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Personalized espresso cups offer endless design possibilities, from classic and minimalist styles to bold and contemporary patterns. The shape of the cup, including the curve of the lip and the size of the handle, affects the drinking experience and overall aesthetic appeal. Consider the cup's weight and balance in hand. The placement and style of the personalization, whether it's a monogram, image, or quote, play a crucial role in its visual impact.

**Customization Options:** The key to a truly personalized espresso cup lies in the range of customization options offered by the vendor. These can include engraving, printing, etching, or even hand-painting. High-quality customization ensures the design is durable, resistant to fading, and dishwasher-safe (if applicable). The availability of different fonts, colors, and image resolutions allows for greater creative control. Preview tools that provide a virtual rendering of the personalized cup before production are highly desirable.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics:** The handle of an espresso cup, though seemingly minor, plays a significant role in its usability and comfort. It should be sized appropriately for comfortable gripping, even when the cup is full and hot. Handles can vary in shape and style, from conventional looped handles to modern minimalist designs. Consider the handle's material and its insulation properties to prevent heat transfer to the fingers. an ergonomic design enhances the overall drinking experience.

**Durability and Maintenance:** An ideal personalized espresso cup should be durable and easy to maintain. Dishwasher and microwave compatibility are key considerations for convenience. The finish should be resistant to scratches, chips, and fading. The material should be non-reactive to acidic liquids like espresso, preventing corrosion or discoloration. Proper care and cleaning will prolong the lifespan of the personalized design.

**What are the most durable materials for personalized espresso cups?**
Porcelain and ceramic are generally considered the most durable materials for espresso cups due to their resistance to high temperatures and chipping.

Glass cups, particularly those made of borosilicate, are heat-resistant but more prone to breakage than ceramic options.

**How can I ensure the printed design on my personalized espresso cup lasts?**
Choose vendors that use high-quality printing or engraving techniques.Look for options that are advertised as dishwasher-safe and fade-resistant. Avoid abrasive cleaning products that coudl damage the design. Hand-washing is often recommended for personalized cups to prolong the lifespan of the print.

**what are the best fonts to use for personalization on espresso cups?**
The best font choices depend on the overall design and aesthetic you're aiming for. Serif fonts like Times New Roman or Garamond convey a classic and elegant look, while sans-serif fonts like Arial or Helvetica offer a more modern and minimalist feel. Script fonts can add a touch of personality, but readability is crucial. Choose a font size that is appropriate for the cup's surface area.

**Are personalized espresso cups dishwasher-safe?**
Not all personalized espresso cups are dishwasher-safe. Check the product description or vendor information for specific instructions. High-quality printing or engraving might potentially be dishwasher-safe, but delicate designs or finishes may require hand-washing.

I was raised on a steady diet of Monty Python, Blackadder, Fawlty Towers, and The Vicar of Dibley — and I’m hoping you were too. If you know the joy of a dry remark or can deliver a punchline with a straight face, we might just get along famously.

A little about me: I’m a Social Worker  with a passion for graphic design, photography and meaningful connections. I’m also involved in disability advocacy and serve on an advisory committee — I care deeply about making the world a bit more inclusive, and I bring that same empathy into my relationships.

I have mild cerebral palsy, which just means I do some things differently — but it’s never slowed me down. In fact, it’s made me patient, thoughtful, and tuned in to what really matters. I’m someone who values kindness, loyalty, and being present. I don’t play games — unless we’re talking pub quizzes or Cards Against Humanity.

In relationships, I’m affectionate, romantic, and deeply supportive. My past partners have always felt seen, cared for, and appreciated. I’m healing from a recent breakup, and while I’m not looking to rush anything, I do believe in real connection — whether that’s a spark over shared sarcasm or a slow burn built on trust.

I love a good wine tasting, exploring new food spots, photo walks, and cheeky banter over coffee. I’m just as happy staying in with a curry and a classic episode of Absolutely Fabulous as I am trying something new in the city.

I’m looking to meet someone down-to-earth, emotionally intelligent, and open-hearted.  If your ideal date involves quoting Keeping Up Appearances while strolling through a park.

So if you’re a woman in your 40s or early 50s who loves a clever joke, has a good heart, and still laughs at the same British sitcoms you grew up on — send me a message. I’d love to get to know you, make you laugh, and see where things go.

The one guy stopped me in a mall to ask me something and then proceeded to tell me how he liked me and how about to grab a coffee together, but I refused. Later I was told I did the right thing by refusing, as who knows where he could have actually taken me. The second case, a man offered me a ride, I ride the bus that day far than my initial intention and had to walk back. I refused, but he actually insisted for a while and I got scared. Thankfully, he eventually left.
Now, officially at 40, I feel like I might have dodged a bullet with those two encounters. In todays world you can never be too cautios. Better that, than becoming a statistic, kidnapped and raped, even murdered and your body dumped somewhere. It happens all the time.

1m4x3fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmsprings/comments/1m4x3fg/restaurant_inspections_palm_desert_and_rancho/,Restaurant inspections: Palm Desert and Rancho Mirage eateries downgraded due to food temp,"No Coachella Valley eateries were closed by Riverside County health inspectors this week, but several were downgraded, according to reports.

Both Tommy Bahama in Palm Desert and Sapporo Ramen in Palm Desert were downgraded due to improper food handling temperatures, and Art Alkobar in Indio was downgraded due to improper water temperatures, among other violations.

Olga's Tacos in Coachella and Hibachi in Rancho Mirage passed their respective reinspection and were reopened after each failing a previous inspection the week before.

A few atypical inspection results were also observed:

During what was meant to be a routine inspection of the food facilities at Sun City Palm Desert, inspectors were informed that a remodel was taking place at the facility. The bar area named ""Daily Grind/Martini"" was observed to have been demolished, but the large kitchen attached to the ""Daily Grind/Martini"" was not observed to be under construction. Proper permits were not on file for such work, so the facility must submit remodel/construction plans to this department as well as other agencies for proper approvals for remodels.


The Denny's on 20th Avenue in Palm Springs passed its reinspection, but only on the condition that its front-of-house AC system — which was determined to be broken upon the last inspection — is fixed by the time of the next routine inspection. The restaurant was allowed to remain open because portable AC units placed in the dining area were offering a sufficient amount of air for customer comfort.


The mobile food truck at Indian Wells Golf Resort was closed due to the presence of total coliform after a recent water inspection, but upon reinspection July 15, it was absent from the water and the facility was approved to operate.

Here are the restaurants that were inspected in the Coachella Valley July 10 through 17:

After days of research, I settled on the Hario switch (less heated plastics and easier to clean than others). 
I went to my local coffee roaster and chose an organic colombian roast that was roasted a week ago and ground in front of me. 

I followed the coffee chroniclers recipe on youtube as per Reddit recs and my coffee was so acidic and watery. I prefer italian coffee when it comes to k cups and always bought the Illy cups that advertise ""top 1% arabica beans"" so whatever that means. It's smooth, rich, no acid taste and not bitter. 
I'm hoping I can achieve the results from my ninja keurig which seems wild to say considering how fresh of coffee i'm using but i know it is dependent on so many things.
I'm also think i'm going to have to go decaf with this method as the caffiene hit i got from that pour over was insane. 

Can anyone recommend a good decaf bean that would be a good fit for me? ",0,1753038140.0,pourover,9,0.25,False

Hi!  My name is Russell and I’m a film maker. 

Recently my best friend (who is a 2nd grade teacher) asked if I could make a little 2min inspirational video for the local elementary school. After completing that video I got an idea. Why not make another video that’s just for the teachers, all about the things they didn’t tell you before you became a teacher. 

For example:

They didn’t say you’d repeat “Please sit down” thirty-seven times before 9 AM.

They didn’t tell you that your “teacher voice” would become your only voice.

They didn’t say you’d spend half your day untangling backpack straps and refereeing pencil ownership disputes.

They didn’t tell you that your coffee would go cold every day because you’d forget you made it.

They didn’t say your heart would break when a kid says, “I don’t get it.”

They didn’t say you’d keep trying anyway.

They didn’t say you’d celebrate the day they finally do.

Thing is, I’m not a teacher, so I don’t know all the inside jokes teachers share. That’s where you come in!



I need all your “they didn’t tell me..” phrases. Be them funny, sarcastic, heartfelt, inspirational, let me hear them! 

All the teachers are getting together for a pre-school year meeting at the beginning of august, my plan is to surprise them with the video there. I’ll also post a link here for everyone. 


Thanks so much!  I can’t wait to hear what you guys come up with!  ",0,1753037981.0,teaching,9,0.36,False

I’ve used it in my kitchen every day over the past month, experimenting with its features and observing how it performs in a real-life setting. It’s a sleek stormy blue glass pitcher with a silicone base that doesn’t just sit pretty on your countertop but also claims to deliver impressive water purification capabilities, targeting everything from bacteria and parasites to PFAS, lead, and mercury. It’s certainly not your average pitcher filter, but there’s a lot more to unpack about it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The craftsmanship of this filter pitcher is truly commendable. Made from hand-blown borosilicate glass, it feels sturdy, heavy-duty, and far more premium compared to typical plastic-based pitchers that I’ve used before. The glass doesn’t just add an aesthetic appeal but also feels cleaner and less prone to harboring odors or stains over time. Its silicone base is a practical touch—I no longer worry about accidentally sliding it across my countertop, especially during hurried mornings when I’m walking around half-awake. The pitcher’s handle is ergonomic enough for easy pouring, though it does require a bit more caution due to its weight when it’s full of water.  

[Grab LifeStraw LSH7GLSSB21 at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0bbskn1jg/)

**Filtration Performance**  
What really sets this product apart is its groundbreaking filtration capability. It tackles over 30 contaminants, including bacteria, parasites, and microplastics—features rarely seen in other pitcher-style filters. I tested this on regular tap water that previously had a faint chlorine taste, and wow, the difference was night and day. According to the product's claims, it even retains essential minerals like magnesium and potassium. Whether or not my magnesium levels have improved is something I can’t confirm, but what I do know is my coffee tastes significantly better now. Water clarity has been consistent too—no more cloudy water or that odd smell you sometimes get from generic filters.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Setting up this filter pitcher was surprisingly straightforward. The membrane microfilter lasts up to a whopping 264 gallons, which equals about a year of use for me, while the second activated carbon filter only lasts 40 gallons (around two months), so refills come a bit sooner on that part. Swapping out the filters is manageable, though aligning the components initially took me a couple of attempts. Cleaning the glass pitcher requires a little careful handling because it feels fragile compared to heavier, chunkier designs, but on the flip side, glass is miles easier to keep spotless than plastic.  

**Benefits**  
- Exceptional filtration that removes bacteria, parasites, and microplastics.  
- Sleek, sustainable glass design adds style to your kitchen.  
- Retains important minerals like magnesium and potassium.  
- Long-lasting membrane microfilter offers great convenience.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The glass material, while premium, adds extra weight.  
- More frequent replacement required for the carbon filter.  
- Limited size—only 7 cups, making it less ideal for larger households.  

**Target Audience: Who Will Love It?**  
This product caters perfectly to health-conscious households or individuals keen on avoiding unnecessary contaminants in their drinking water. If you're someone who dislikes the taste of tap water or, like me, has been burned before by subpar filters, this pitcher could be the answer. However, the quieter, 7-cup capacity might not cut it for families churning through gallons of water daily. On a busy weekend, I quickly found myself refilling the pitcher multiple times, a minor inconvenience I didn’t expect, but perhaps a trade-off for such comprehensive filtration.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Over the years, I’ve used Brita and ZeroWater pitcher filters, and they do a fair job. Brita, for example, has a simpler design and smoother user experience but doesn’t quite address contaminants like microplastics or PFAS. ZeroWater is closer to the LifeStraw in total purifying capability but often sacrifices taste by stripping away minerals. Between the three, the LifeStraw water filter edges ahead for its balance of advanced filtration and water taste—two things that truly make a difference for me.  

**Quality for Price**  
While this pitcher might seem a bit steep for some, investing in high-quality filters makes a lot of financial sense in the long run. I’ve already noticed my reliance on bottled water drop to almost zero, which feels good for both my wallet and the environment. Plus, the durability of the glass build justifies the slight upfront cost bump over all-plastic alternatives. Knowing that every purchase provides one child with a year of safe drinking water is a satisfying bonus.

I posted about it 2 days later. I just now realized it had been removed/unposted, due to my account being less than 5 days old at the time.  So I'm reposting now, to get anyone's thoughts. It was also removed in Glitch in the Matrix so im reposting here in Timeslips. 

This COULD fall under a time slip, except I went BACK in time/gained time, rather than forward, or losing time...

I had a mind blowing experience 2 nights ago. We had a storm here, suddenly. Out of nowhere, right around 10pm. It was still outside, then like 0 to 60, my house was being shaken by enormous blasts of wind. Everyone else was DEAD asleep already,  my husband and 2 elementary aged kids. We'd all fallen asleep in the living room watching TV. So only i experienced this in my household. The wind was so hard it thundered thru our house, and I felt my ears actual pop due to the pressure change INSIDE despite the only air leakage capable thru things like stove vents. I was actually shocked by the ferocity of the sudden wind storm, despite living in what many call Rain City, and having just 2 seasons here: wet stormy weather for 9 months, and mildly hot summers for 3 months. This storm was atypical, to say the least. 

I then fell asleep fast somehow despite being physically shook by the storm and somewhat unnerved by it.  I woke up at 2:38am. I remember because I checked the clock, and was bummed my husband's alarm was to go off at 2:45am (to get up by 3, wake up with coffee till 4, be out the door by 4:30, to be at work by 5am). I wanted to get back to sleep before being reawakened by his alarms. I was drenched in sweat, the storm had stopped by then and it was absolutely still and silent out, unusually still, not even a slight breeze or single raindrop. I got up, changed outta my sweaty PJs, laid back down to try to sleep before my husband's alarm. I woke again at 12:38am, TWO HOURS EARLIER!!! Again, no sign of any storm. I then got up, got a snack, laid down and fell asleep. But I awoke again every 15-20 minutes all night after that. I kept thinking ""wow, this is the longest night ever"". So I'd somehow GAINED 2 hours, uninvolved in any daylight savings time or anything.  The clock I check is analog, battery run, and the time had to be physically changed on the clock itself if needed.  I'd checked my phone and our wall clock as well (another battery run only, analog clock). Again, all the times matched on each clock and my cell Phone too, when i woke up at 2:38am, then12:38am, and again every 15-20 minutes till morning. 

So WTF? How did i go BACK 2 hours to 12:38am? What's up with the weird storm? No one in my neighborhood remembers it. They all said the same thing ""I was dead asleep"". Some even reported passing out at 7pm or 8pm, oddly early for them. In fact, they all seemed surprised by how deep they all slept. The storm did happen.  Leaves, branches and debris were blown everywhere the next morning and everything was soaking wet. Although it had stopped at 2:38am, as well as zero storm activity at 12:38am when i reawoke. Did it have anything to do with my time jump? Did we all jump together? Did i leave my dimension and join yours? I hope not. I'd prefer to raise my kids from my original dimension, lol. Again, WTF???

Has anyone else ever gained time like this? Rather than lost time? If so, what was your experience? And does anyone have any theories as to what happened? Or any theories on why? How? What it means? If anything? I'm so curious! Share your thoughts with me!!!

Edit to add: I had canged out of my sweaty drenched clothes while checking the clocks. The sweaty PJs were still where I'd left them the night before. I definitely was awake and not dreaming.",0,1753037913.0,timetravel,4,0.44,False

I’m getting scared for my safety and for her health.,"How can I talk to my friend about her alcohol abuse? We are both exotic dancers and I’m her ride to work and her roommate so it’s close to home. Well…it’s IN my home, I guess I could say. So obviously because of our job we are around alcohol quite a bit. The club does not sell it, however the girls bring their own. Anyways, that’s beside the point. She gets extremely drunk at work to the point where she blacks out and I have to put her clothes on her and carry her out to the car. She gets aggressive with me and the other girls, she puts herself into dangerous situations with customers, one time she got so drunk she LEFT WORK WITH A CUSTOMER TO GO TO BARS TO DRINK EVEN MORE!!! That was a whole situation of me having to track her down and bring her home. She got fired from that club after that. She’s been fired from two clubs already for her drunk antics. Last night, she split an entire bottle of vodka with one other girl. Just her and another girl finished a whole bottle in one sitting. 

I have to basically be like her baby sitter. I have to keep track of all of her things, her bags, her makeup, her money, her phone, her vape, her shoes, everything. I’m pretty sure she’s about to get fired from our current club, too if she doesn’t straighten up because the manager said he’s going to have a talk with her. People have started calling her “the drunk”. 

She tells me to cut her off, so I try….but she doesn’t listen. If I try to physically force a drink out of her hand, she gets violent. When she’s sober, before she starts drinking, she’ll be like “I’m telling you, you NEED to cut me off” WELL IM TRYING TO BUT I CANT DO SHIT WITHOUT YOU TRYING TO FIGHT ME!!! 

I hate alcohol. I do not drink and before I met her, I’ve never experienced being around someone drunk like that before. I don’t know how to deal with it or how to cut her off without getting physically harmed. I’m very mentally drained. She will not admit she has a problem. I don’t want to deal with it anymore. 

Besides my selfish views of “I’m tired of babysitting a grown-ass adult” I’m also worried about how this is affecting her health. I’ve had to call 911, or just driven her to the hospital myself multiple times now because she gets severely dehydrated to the point where she needs I.V fluids. She will go two days without drinking water and only drink coffee and then a lot of alcohol. 

She never remembers what happens the day after and denies everything. When I tell her what happened she’ll say “no none of that happened I didn’t do anything/ I didn’t cause problems/ I didn’t black out/ I didn’t get that drunk/ I remember everything” some excuse of that nature. Then she gets really upset at me and thinks I’m just “talking shit” or making a big deal out of nothing and ends up rolling her eyes, slamming doors, calling people and ranting to them about how I’m “over-reacting”. 

This morning when I told her what happened in the dressing room last night she was like “no we were having a good time, what do you mean? I didn’t even do anything I don’t believe you I remember everything that happened” then rolled her eyes, threw her arms up and slammed the door. No girl….no one had a good time. She slapped a girl, and then called another one a bitch and almost started a fight, then put on another girl’s shoes thinking they were hers (her shoes are thigh-high black boots…the other girl’s shoes were small, clear heels….complete opposites)  then she snapped at me when all I did was walk in to re-apply makeup, I walked in and she just started yelling at me??? The girls got between us and asked if I was going to even be safe alone with her in the car….they were worried about my safety. No one was having a good time. We were anxious as fuck.

If you are in a place that doesn’t even have that: force yourself to time out for 10 minutes.  Tell others you’re in error mode.  Take 10 minutes to just think about things that bring you joy.

I've used it almost daily for brewing coffee and loose-leaf tea, and I’ve got a lot to share about how it performed in real-life settings. Whether you’re considering this product for its aesthetics or its performance, there’s plenty to unpack here, so let's dive straight into the details.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Build Quality**  
Let’s be honest—this coffee press is undeniably a statement piece. The pink and gold design immediately stood out on my countertop, and the temperature-safe glass encased in a golden stainless steel frame with heart-shaped details gives the whole setup a touch of luxury. My initial reaction was, ""Is this too pretty to use daily?"" But it turns out that the sturdy build quality didn’t feel as fragile as I thought. At 1.6 pounds, it has a solid and durable feel without being cumbersome. The stay-cool handle is genuinely functional, which is important because no one wants a kitchen accessory that prioritizes looks over usability. That being said, I had to exercise caution while cleaning, as the delicate heart accents on the frame could potentially catch on cleaning sponges or cloths if rushed.

**Functionality and User Experience**  
Using the Paris Hilton coffee press was as simple as the instructions claimed. The process involves adding coarsely ground coffee or loose-leaf tea with the included heart-shaped measuring scoop, pouring hot water, letting it steep for about four minutes, and gently pressing down the plunger. The reusable fine mesh stainless steel filter worked well to contain the grounds, ensuring that my cup stayed clean and free of grit. One afternoon, my sister-in-law (a tea enthusiast) tried using it for loose-leaf tea, and even she was impressed by the mesh filter's effectiveness in keeping the leaves from escaping into the brewed tea. It certainly made both coffee and tea prep feel easy and intuitive, even for first-timers.  

[Find the best price for Paris Hilton B0B2L1ZWJF on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0b2l1zwjf/)

**Winning Points**  
- Stylish design with pink and gold accents that elevate any kitchen’s aesthetic.  
- Solid build featuring temperature-safe glass and stainless steel components.  
- The reusable filter does a great job preventing tea or coffee grounds from escaping.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Cleaning the intricate heart accents on the golden frame needs extra care.  
- At times, the plunger required a bit more effort compared to some other presses I’ve used.  

**Capacity and Versatility**  
Measuring around 7x7x8.5 inches, the coffee press has a capacity of 8 cups or 34 ounces, which I found ideal for hosting a small brunch with friends or serving morning coffee for two people casually sipping throughout the day. One standout feature was its easy adaptability; whether you’re brewing for yourself or multiple people, the manual operation ensures that it’s simple enough to scale your quantities up or down depending on your needs. During a family camping trip, this coffee maker became a centerpiece for glamping mornings—it’s functional and portable enough to take along without much fuss.  

**Competitive Options**  
If you’re shopping for a French press in this price and style range, there are definitely a few alternatives to consider. The Bodum Chambord is one of the more standard options, and while it doesn’t boast Paris Hilton’s unique pink and gold design, it’s known for its reliability. On the other hand, Frieling’s all-metal French press provides impeccable heat retention, though it lacks the visual appeal. Compared to these, the Paris Hilton press clearly excels in aesthetics while still delivering decent coffee quality. However, if you prioritize performance and insulation, rivals like Frieling or Stanley might edge ahead.  

**Quality for Price**  
For anyone wondering if this coffee press turns out to be a worthy investment, I’d say it delivers on certain unique promises like its chic design and ease of use. Is it the most affordable French press on the market? Likely not. But, for what it offers—both beauty and functionality—it feels like a splurge item that actually holds its value. It's the sort of product that you wouldn’t hide in the cabinet but proudly display on your counter, earning its keep as a conversation-starter at brunch or coffee dates.

i used to be a seasoned stoner as it was something that got me out of bed in the morning. since i’ve quit, things have been fine, but i have to wonder if i’ll be able to smoke again. 

for context, i used to smoke weed everyday until i started to feel that after i smoked i would basically would feel like my heart was going to explode out of my chest. it wasn’t like any anxiety i had ever felt before, in fact it didn’t feel like anxiety at all—sometimes it felt as if i had a blockage in my heart valves, and i’ve had palpitations. after many trips to the er and ruling out that my heart is healthy, i’ve been told that yes, it is anxiety, or next best guess is esophageal pain. has anybody else experienced this? and have you been able to return to your previous regiments of smoking? only asking because i have seen another reddit user detail how they smoked for 30 years and can’t anymore after hpylori. which was less than encouraging to say the least..

and i’ve seen the same with coffee drinkers being unable to intake coffee anymore. is there anybody who has been able to drink coffee like before without issues? i’ve been so tempted to have a fourth of a cup of coffee mixed with dairy free milk or just diluted with water to test my stomach, but i stop myself because i feel it’s for the best that i continue to wait for now. since i’ve heard healing can take quite a while because the stomach lining and the gut needs to repair themselves, i’ve been fully prepared to do what i have to do to heal. 

i guess i’m just wondering if life can return to what it was before finding out i had hpylori? ",2,1753037554.0,HPylori,1,1.0,False

I lost my final embryo about this time last year. Seven tries total, seven losses. And things have definitely gotten better since I lost my first daughter. But honestly I am just fumbling my way through every single day like it’s a dark room and I don’t have a flashlight. Does anybody else feel like this?

By now, I know that grief comes in waves, and sometimes those waves drown me for an hour or a half day or a few days in a row, but then the storm dies down and I get a few hours or days of reprieve. I’m still regimented about doing all the things to help — therapy, exercise, eating well, two different anti-depressants, proper sleep, getting outside, adopting a pet, journaling, cooking at home, reading books, treating myself to a nice coffee or meal — but every day I just think, is this it? Will I always have to work so hard just to make it through the day? 

I wish away so much time because I just want to fall asleep again so I can be unconscious and not feel the way I feel. It’s not always bad, like I said, but it is always *sad,* and I don’t want another 20 or 30 or 40 years of this. Does it ever stop feeling like slogging through deep water with no end in sight?

1m4wqkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1m4wqkc/she_had_a_son_and_a_daughter_and_was_married_to/,"She had a son and a daughter, and was married to the richest man in the world","After Jennifer Jefferson was reborn, she found herself back at the age of 27.  
  
She had a son and a daughter, and was married to the richest man in the world, Leonard Faron. He topped the ""Number One Man Women Most Want to Marry"" list in a well-known magazine, and was someone even foreign royalty wanted to marry.  
  
Everyone said she was incredibly lucky, but the first thing she did after her rebirth was to take a divorce agreement to meet his first love.  
  
She slid the papers across the table to Samantha Miller and said calmly, ""I want a divorce. You can have Leonard and the kids.""  
  
Samantha stared at Jennifer with a stunned expression. She couldn't believe the woman who had held the title of Leonard's wife for six years was now willingly giving it up.  
  
Jennifer merely added blandly, ""Since they all prefer you, I'll step aside. Just get Leonard to sign it. I'll leave once the cooling-off period is over.""  
  
This time, she would not repeat the same mistakes. She would not be the invisible Mrs. Faron.  
  
Samantha absentmindedly toyed with the rim of her cup with a frown. ""Jennifer, what kind of game are you playing?""  
  
Jennifer replied calmly, ""I'm not playing games. I'm just done.""  
  
Samantha asked, ""Do you know how many women out there would kill to be in your place?""  
  
Jennifer met Samantha's gaze and said, ""I do. That's why I'm giving it to you.""  
  
For the first time, a crack appeared in Samantha's expression.  
  
She stared at the agreement for a long time before finally picking it up. ""Fine. Since you're being so generous, I won't hold back. But remember, I never return what's already given to me.""  
  
Jennifer smiled. ""Don't worry. I won't regret this.""  
  
After all, in her previous life, she had already tasted what it meant to live in loneliness.  
  
Samantha stood up and moved to another table in the cafe, pulling out her phone and tapping on the screen a few times.  
  
When the call connected, she said softly, ""Leonard, I'm at the Blue Mountain Cafe. Can you come pick me up?""  
  
Jennifer sat quietly nearby, and the corners of her lips lifted in a bitter smile.  
  
Back then, whenever she called Leonard, nine times out of ten it would be his assistant, Victor Carlson, who answered.  
  
But now, not even 20 minutes later, the man who was always ""in a meeting"" walked through the cafe doors.  
  
Their six-year-old son, Yannick Faron, and their four-year-old daughter, Yvonne Faron, immediately ran toward Samantha, hugging and kissing her.  
  
""Aunt Sam!"" Yvonne called out sweetly, nuzzling into her embrace.  
  
Leonard placed a cake box on the table and pushed it toward Samantha. ""Your favourite cake. I asked the chef to use less sugar.""  
  
Samantha's eyes lit up. ""You still remember.""  
  
In the corner, Jennifer clenched her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms.  
  
In six years of marriage, Leonard never bothered to learn her favorite flavors.  
  
Once, when she was hospitalized and craved strawberry cake, he had Victor pick up one at random. It turned out to be mango flavored, which she was allergic to.  
  
""What do you want for dinner?"" Leonard asked.  
  
Before answering, Samantha pulled out the divorce agreement from her purse. ""Before that, I'd like you to look over this document.""  
  
She flipped over to the signature page. ""I have my eye on a villa, but I'm short on liquid cash. Can you…""  
  
Leonard took the pen and signed without even glancing at the contents. ""There's no need to be so formal between us.""  
  
Yannick looked up and asked, ""Is Aunt Sam getting a new house? Daddy, can you get one next to hers? Von and I want to move in with Aunt Sam. We don't want to stay with Mom anymore.""  
  
Leonard frowned slightly, but he relented at the hopeful expressions of the two children. ""Alright, I'll buy one.""  
  
Samantha said in a hurry, ""There's no need to trouble yourself. I'll just set aside three rooms at my place. One, for each of you. Then, you can stay with me whenever you want.""  
  
The kids cheered excitedly, and Leonard even kissed Samantha on the cheek. ""Aunt Sam is the best! She's a thousand times better than Mom!""  
  
Jennifer felt like her heart was being crushed by an invisible hand. The pain was so suffocating that she could barely breathe.  
  
She saw the slight upward curve of Leonard's lips. It was a look that he had never shown her before.  
  
Unable to bring herself to watch any longer, she grabbed her bag and left.  
  
As she stepped outside, memories from her past life came flooding back.  
  
In her previous life, her marriage to Leonard had been a business decision. They had a son and a daughter, and even at the age of 62, she remained unhappy.  
  
That was because Leonard's heart had always belonged to his first love, Samantha.  
  
After their breakup, Samantha went abroad, and Leonard drank himself into a stupor for a few days. But his pride kept him from chasing after her to win her back. Instead, she agreed to a marriage alliance his family proposed.  
  
Leonard was someone she had dreamed of marrying when she was a teenager. His status put him firmly at the top of society. Every young lady in the city dreamed of marrying the heir of the Faron family.  
  
So when she learned of their engagement, she was ecstatic.  
  
But even though she gave it her all in the marriage, she was only greeted with Leonard's cold and indifferent attitude.  
  
Then Samantha came back.  
  
He never mentioned divorce, but his attention was always focused on Samantha.  
  
Worse was the fact that the children also grew closer to Samantha and started distancing themselves from her.  
  
In her old age, Jennifer was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Under the guise of giving her space to ""rest"", Leonard abandoned her in their old home.  
  
On her birthday, she shakily dialed her husband and children's numbers, only to find out they were vacationing with Samantha overseas.  
  
She tried to cook herself a simple birthday meal, but in her confused state, she forgot to turn off the stove.  
  
As the fire engulfed her, her last memory was Leonard's cold gaze as he placed the wedding ring on her finger.  
  
She closed her eyes in agony. At that moment, all she could think of was that, if there were a next life, she would never give herself to him again.  
  
It was already late in the night when Jennifer returned to the villa. But instead of resting, she started packing up.  
  
She tossed Leonard's suits, the children's toys, family photos, and the like all into boxes.  
  
""What are you doing?"" Leonard suddenly spoke out from behind her.  
  
Jennifer turned around to see Leonard standing at the door with the kids. He had a frown on his face.  
  
""Why is Mom throwing our stuff away?"" Yvonne ran over, and she was furious when she saw her stuffed bear in the box.  
  
Yannick glared at her angrily. ""We just went to have some fun with Aunt Sam. Do you have to be so mad?""  
  
As always, Leonard looked at her coldly. ""The kids like being with Samantha. Do you really need to make a fuss over something so trivial?""  
  
""I'm not angry,"" Jennifer said calmly.  
  
Yvonne shrieked, ""Liar! You're just jealous of Aunt Sam! That's why you threw away my teddy bear! You're a bad Mom!""  
  
Yannick pulled his sister close and said, ""I'm going to move in with Aunt Sam when I grow up. We'll never come back to see you!""  
  
Leonard didn't stop them from shouting. He merely frowned slightly and looked at Jennifer as if she were a stranger making a scene.  
  
""That's enough,"" he said. He adjusted his cufflinks coldly and continued, ""I've got a board meeting. Throw out whatever you want, just don't make a mess.""  
  
The door clicked shut behind him, and finally, Jennifer's tears began to fall.  
  
Her heart felt like it had been torn to shreds.   
  
She wiped her face, looked at the wreckage around her, and suddenly laughed.  
  
There was nothing to worry about; she wouldn't disturb him.  
  
Not for the rest of her life.  
Chapter 2  
Jennifer stopped managing the household after the divorce agreement was signed.  
  
She no longer woke up at five in the morning to make nutritious breakfasts for the kids, nor stayed up late to tend to Leonard's drunken self after his business dinners.  
  
All the chores she once took for granted as her duty were now handed over to the household staff.  
  
No one noticed anything unusual at first. Then, Yannick was late for school and scolded by his teacher, Yvonne couldn't find her homework notebook, and Leonard's pocket watch stopped ticking.  
  
The household staff scrambled to fix things, but no one could meet the standard Jennifer had upheld.  
  
Dirty dishes piled up in the kitchen, toys were scattered across the living room, and ironed shirts were never crisp enough.  
  
The household, which had once been impeccably organized, was now slipping into chaos.  
  
When Leonard pushed open the bedroom door, Jennifer was leaning by the window, reading a book.  
  
Sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains, casting shadows over her figure.  
  
""How long are you planning to keep this up?"" Leonard asked from the doorway in a low tone.  
  
Jennifer closed her book and looked up. ""I'm not doing anything.""  
  
""Then why are you ignoring everything at home?"" Leonard stepped closer, and the faint whiff of cologne could be smelled. ""Are you still mad about what happened last time?""  
  
Jennifer placed the book aside and replied, ""I'm not mad. I just don't want to bother anymore.""  
  
Leonard narrowed his eyes and tapped his finger on the table. ""Why?""  
  
Jennifer said calmly, ""I'm tired. We have staff at home, so there's no reason I need to do all of this.""  
  
She recalled how she would get up before dawn every day in her past life.  
  
Leonard's coffee had to be precisely 185 degrees Fahrenheit, and his sandwiches had to be toasted to a golden, crisp perfection. The children's clothes had to be hand-washed, and their socks were always ironed perfectly smooth.  
  
And what did she get in return? Leonard was only gentle toward Samantha, and the children got closer and closer to Aunt Sam. And on her 62nd birthday, she died alone.  
  
Leonard said coldly, ""Jennifer, if you're upset, just say it. Don't act like a child.""  
  
Jennifer had a wry smile on her face. ""I'm not upset. I just want to rest.""  
  
Before she even finished speaking, the door was flung open.  
  
Yannick and Yvonne burst in angrily.  
  
Yvonne shouted, ""Mom's too lazy! We want Aunt Sam to take care of us!""  
  
""She's gentler, works harder, and is a million times better than you!"" Yannick chimed in.  
  
Leonard's gaze stayed fixed on Jennifer's face, as if he were waiting for her to yield. But she simply took a deep breath and said softly, ""If you all think she's better, then bring her here. I don't mind.""  
  
The place went completely silent.  
  
Leonard's expression darkened completely. ""Are you sure?""  
  
Jennifer took another deep breath. ""I'm very sure.""  
  
Yvonne eagerly tugged at Leonard's sleeve. ""Let's go, Dad! I want Aunt Sam to come right now!""  
  
Yannick made a face at her. ""We don't need you anymore if she's coming! Just leave! Get out of this house!""  
  
Leonard looked at Jennifer one last time. When he saw the indifferent look on her face, he turned and left with the children.  
  
Jennifer stood where she was, listening to the sound of the car engine fade into the distance before she slowly closed her eyes.  
  
Very soon, she would give them what they wanted.  
  
She would leave them all and leave this household behind.  
Chapter 3  
On the first day Samantha moved in, she immediately began directing the staff to redecorate the living room.  
  
""The couch is too dull,"" she said softly. Her slender fingers brushed across the leather cushions as she turned and smiled at Leonard. ""Leonard, how about we change them to something in off-white?""  
  
Leonard didn't even blink. He simply turned to the butler, Neil Watts, and said, ""Do as Ms. Miller says.""  
  
Standing at the stairway landing, Jennifer watched as workers carried out the couch she had carefully chosen just six months ago.  
  
Yannick and Yvonne followed behind Samantha like two excited puppies, pointing and chattering. ""Aunt Sam, change this pillow, too! Mom bought it, and it's so ugly!""  
  
Samantha gently patted their heads. ""Alright, we'll change them all.""  
  
Jennifer curled her fingers up slightly, but she quickly let go.  
  
Those pillows had been sewn by her when she was pregnant. She'd stuffed them with hypoallergenic cotton because children had sensitive skin when they were young.  
  
Now, the pillows were thrown into the trash without a second thought.  
  
Over the following days, the house grew increasingly unfamiliar.  
  
At the dining table, Samantha would sit where Jennifer used to sit, tenderly serving the children their food.  
  
Every now and then, Leonard would pour her a cup of coffee and push it toward her. His eyes would be filled with a gentleness that Jennifer never received.  
  
At night, the living room lights would dim, and the four of them would cuddle on the couch to watch movies.  
  
Yvonne curled up into Samantha's arms, while Yannick leaned against Leonard's shoulder. Laughter would echo from the room.  
  
When Jennifer walked by, no one would even spare her a second glance. She had become invisible in her own home.  
  
What made it even more absurd was that, once upon a time, the three Farons had been outrageously picky about their lifestyle.  
  
But what about now?  
  
Jennifer watched as Samantha casually tossed a ten-million-dollar Patek Philippe watch face down on the coffee table, but Leonard still wore it lovingly.  
  
She watched the children happily head to school in uniforms Samantha had just casually tossed into the washing machine, still stained from yesterday's sauce.  
  
Then, she watched as Samantha poured takeout onto plates and pretended she'd cooked it herself, yet no one exposed her.  
  
The most ridiculous part was how they spoiled Samantha like she was royalty.  
  
Leonard gently held Samantha's wrist and said, ""Samantha, don't touch these heavy dishes. Your hands were made to play piano.""  
  
""Aunt Sam, let me carry your bag!"" Yannick eagerly took her limited edition handbag, smiling so strangely that Jennifer could barely recognize her son.  
  
Neil said, ""Ms. Miller, just rest. Leave everything to us.""  
  
Jennifer had worked like a servant in this house for years, but no one had batted an eye.  
  
Yet, the moment Samantha arrived, she became a princess at the center of everyone's world.  
  
Behind the scenes, the staff whispered amongst themselves.   
  
""Mr. Faron treats Ms. Miller so well. He was never like that with Mrs. Faron.""  
  
""The children stick to Ms. Miller all day, too. I think the mistress of this household is about to change.""  
  
Jennifer's heart had long gone cold. She stopped caring about it and quietly packed her belongings.  
  
One afternoon, Jennifer's phone suddenly buzzed nonstop.  
  
""Mrs. Faron! The children both had allergic reactions at school! The ambulance just took them to the hospital!""  
  
By the time Jennifer arrived, the children had already been rushed into the emergency room.  
  
Leonard stood in the corridor with his suit jacket draped over his arm and his tie hanging loosely around his neck. His eyes burned with cold fury.  
  
""Jennifer,"" he said in a low voice, barely containing the anger that was simmering beneath his words. ""What the hell are you doing?""  
  
Jennifer froze. ""What?""  
  
""Don't you know they're allergic to mangoes?"" Leonard stepped closer and looked down at her. ""Why did you let them drink mango juice?""  
  
Jennifer met his gaze. ""It wasn't me! I've never bought mangoes for this household.""  
  
Ever since the children had been hospitalized after their first exposure to mangoes, she had been incredibly cautious. She would constantly remind everyone not to let the kids near mangoes, and she would even carefully check the school menu every week. There was no way this could have been her mistake.  
  
""It wasn't you?"" Leonard sneered. ""Then who was it? The staff? Or did they just decide to harm themselves?""  
  
Jennifer opened her mouth, about to respond, when the nurse emerged from the emergency room. ""The children are awake.""  
  
Inside the hospital room, Yannick and Yvonne lay on their beds, looking weak and pale. When they saw the adults enter, there was a flicker in their eyes.  
  
""What happened?"" Leonard asked in a deep voice.

1m4wmzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m4wmzx/could_philips_aquaclean_filter_improve_your/,Could Philips AquaClean Filter Improve Your Coffee Machine? Honest Review of Its Benefits,"Testing out the Philips Kitchen Appliances CA6903/10 AquaClean Original Calc and Water Filter has been an interesting experience. As someone who runs a cappuccino machine daily, I've been on the hunt for a reliable solution that prevents scaling and keeps my coffee tasting divine. This little water filter has definitely proven to be a worthwhile addition, though, like any product, it's not entirely without its quirks.

**Ease of Installation**  
The first thing that caught my attention was how straightforward the installation process is. I mean, it's practically foolproof. It comes with a ""click-and-go"" setup that even my technology-averse coworker was able to figure out in mere seconds. I’ve used other filters before, and let’s just say more than a few cups of water ended up on the floor because of poorly designed fittings. Not with this one. It slots right into compatible Philips or Saeco espresso machines like it was meant to be there.

**Check [Philips Kitchen Appliances CA6903/10] price on Amazon.**  

**Water Filtration Efficiency**  
What stands out most is the filter technology itself. With ion-exchange technology and a micro-porous filter to reduce calcium buildup, the water comes through tasting crisp and pure. This, in return, gives the coffee a fresher, richer flavor. A friend who recently visited actually proclaimed the taste of espresso better than their favorite café. Whether or not that’s true, I think the water filter deserves part of the credit. Coffee aficionados know that water quality can make or break your brew.

**Advantages**  
- No more manual descaling up to 5,000 cups.  
- Helps coffee retain its original taste and aroma.  
- Protects the lifespan of your coffee machine.  

**Build Quality and Lifespan**  
The AquaClean filter feels solidly built, but it's undeniably lightweight. At 159 grams, it doesn’t feel like one of those flimsy options that might crumble under a little pressure. I’ve been using it for just over a month, and so far, it’s holding up well. That said, with one filter being rated for around eight weeks depending on water hardness, replacements can add up for heavy users like myself.

**Drawbacks**  
- Replacement costs over time can be a bit high for frequent users.  
- Lacks adaptability for non-Philips espresso machines.  
- Leaves you reliant on remembering the recommended replacement schedule.

**Target Users**  
This filter is best suited for anyone who regularly uses espresso machines from Philips or Saeco lines. My retired neighbor, whose coffee game has been elevated by this filter, swears by it because she doesn’t want to bother with descaling her machine anymore. However, if you’re an occasional coffee drinker, the 5,000-cup benefit may feel a bit overkill. It's clear this filter is built with coffee enthusiasts gearing towards convenience in mind.

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to other coffee machine water filters on the market, the AquaClean has carved out a niche with its no-descaling promise for 5,000 cups. While using a similar Saeco filter previously, I noticed it only lasted about half the lifespan and wasn’t as easy to install. Then there's the Jura milk system filters, which are great competitors but can’t quite boast the same combined water filtration and machine protection capabilities. Both are viable options, but for overall convenience and efficiency, I personally prefer the AquaClean.

**Value for Money**  
In terms of overall cost-efficiency, this product hovers somewhere in the middle. While the initial expense is reasonable, long-term use requires accounting for replacement filters every couple of months. I think of it as an investment in machine longevity and enhanced coffee quality. Others might wince at the repeated expenses, but for me, it feels worth every penny given the hassle it saves.

It’s just our tight‑knit freelancing team, our laptops, and a lot of coffee‑fueled nights figuring out what truly moves the needle for businesses online.

A recent project sticks out: we revamped a client’s service site with clean UX, faster load times, and a bit of prompt‑powered guidance. Three months later they’re seeing 150+ genuine leads every month—no paid ads, purely organic interest.

What that taught us:

* You don’t need a 50‑module ERP or flashy animations to win trust—clarity and reliability matter far more.
* A solid CMS that non‑tech teams can actually update saves more time (and frustration) than any ultra‑custom feature.
* Real‑time dashboards and auto‑alerts in a CRM aren’t “nice to have”—they’re what turn data into action.
* Behind every feature request is a real person looking for a solution, and every line of code should answer their unspoken question.

We’re still learning, and every niche has its quirks. So tell us:

I've gone through a few different kettles over the years, and I've figured out what features really matter.

First off, capacity is important. Think about how much hot water you typically need. If you're just making tea for yourself, a smaller 1-liter kettle might be fine. But if you're brewing for a family or filling a French press, you'll want something larger, maybe 1.5-2 liters.

Speed is another big factor. A good electric kettle should be able to boil water in just a few minutes. Look for ones with at least 1500 watts of power. Some of the fastest can boil water in under a minute.

Material is something to consider too. Stainless steel is durable and doesn't affect the taste of the water. Glass kettles look nice and let you see the water level easily, but they can be more fragile. Plastic is lightweight but may not last as long.

Temperature control is a feature I've come to appreciate. Different teas and coffees taste best when brewed at specific temperatures. Some kettles have preset buttons for different drinks, while others let you set an exact temperature.

Auto shut-off is a must-have safety feature. It turns the kettle off once the water has boiled, preventing it from boiling dry if you forget about it.

A cordless design is really convenient. The kettle sits on a base that plugs in, but you can lift the kettle off to pour without dealing with a cord.

Water level indicators are helpful, especially if the kettle isn't see-through. It's nice to know exactly how much water you're boiling.

A wide opening makes it easier to fill and clean the kettle. Some have removable filters to catch limescale, which is great if you live in an area with hard water.

Noise level might not seem important, but a really loud kettle can be annoying, especially if you're making tea early in the morning or late at night.

Price is always a factor, but I've found that spending a bit more on a good quality kettle is worth it in the long run. They tend to last longer and work better.

After trying out quite a few, I found a great selection of electric kettles that tick all these boxes. If you're in the market for one, check out this collection: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They've got options for different needs and budgets.

Remember, the best kettle for you depends on your specific needs. Think about how you'll use it most often, and choose one that fits your lifestyle. A good electric kettle can make your daily tea or coffee routine so much smoother and more enjoyable.",1,1753036950.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Incarceration of women is growing worldwide. One woman highlights prison conditions in Thailand – and crusades to change them.

By Jacob Baynham

When she was inmate 5770102414 in a Thai prison, Prontip Mankong had ample opportunity for despair. Each night she slept with 70 to 80 other women, mostly drug offenders, on the linoleum floor of her cell. Her sleeping space was just over a foot wide; not enough room to lie on her back, so she slept on her side. For bedding, she had three sackcloths: one for a pillow, one for a blanket, and one to cover the floor. The fluorescent lights stayed on all night. 

Daytime wasn’t much better. The inmates were awakened early and herded into open showers, where they stood under a pipe with holes in it for 30 seconds. Then they ate a rushed breakfast of rice, vegetables, and some tough chicken. “It was like animal food,” Ms. Prontip recalls. After that they worked in sewing factories, earning as little as 8 baht (23 cents) a day. They were punished if they didn’t meet their production quotas.

Months after seizing power in a 2014 coup, Thailand’s military government – the National Council for Peace and Order – had convicted Prontip of criticizing the Thai monarchy, a serious crime in Thailand. 

So every day in prison, she did what was required. She kept her head down. She endured. But all the while she had a secret. In quiet moments, when the guards weren’t looking, she was keeping a diary. She stole pens and wrote on pages of Genesis that she tore from a Bible. She found ways to smuggle them out. If she had to be in prison, Prontip resolved to use the experience as research. 

In 2016, after two years and 10 days behind bars, Prontip was let out. Today she is using her freedom to champion reform. And she’s using her illicit diary to write a book about Thai prisons.

“I wanted to keep my memories,” she says, four months after her release. “I wanted to keep everything I learned, all of the stories. I had to write something.”

As a woman**,** Prontip was more likely to end up in prison in Thailand than anywhere else in the world. No country incarcerates women at a higher rate. Thailand’s total population of women prisoners – 39,336 at the beginning of 2017 – ranks fourth in the world, behind the much larger countries of the United States, China, and Russia (though women are still only about 13 percent of the overall prison population in Thailand). 

Yet prison was the last thing on Prontip’s mind when she arrived at an airport in southern Thailand on Aug. 15, 2014. Prontip, then a 26-year-old political science graduate, had saved her money and obtained a visa for Australia, where she planned to spend a yearlong working holiday. Her future was a blank page.

Then an airport immigration officer inspected her passport and told her she couldn’t fly. Two police officers escorted her to Bangkok. Her crime, she learned, was directing a satirical play almost a year earlier about a fictional kingdom. 

Prontip had staged it on a Bangkok university campus with a political theater troupe. Now the new military government was accusing her and another actor of insulting Thailand’s monarchy – a crime punishable by 15 years in prison under Thailand’s century-old lèse-majesté law. Since the 2014 coup, the Thai government has prosecuted more than 60 lèse-majesté cases, which are handled in military courts. The military has used the 2007 Computer Crime Act to compound the sentences in some of these prosecutions. In 2015, a man in northern Thailand was sent to prison for 30 years for posting comments on Facebook that were deemed critical of the royal family. 

As is typical in lèse-majesté cases, Prontip was denied bail, so she remained incarcerated during her trial. Finally, four months after her arrest, she pleaded guilty to insulting the crown. She was sentenced to 2-1/2 years at Bangkok’s Central Women’s Correctional Institution. 

By then she was already accustomed to her thin, clay-colored uniform. She had memorized her prisoner number. And she was already learning the unspoken rules of survival in Thailand’s prison system. 

“I knew I had to learn,” she says. “So I learned. I learned for life. I’m a survivor.” 

Thailand imprisons 130 women for every 100,000 women in the population, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit based in Northampton, Mass., that opposes mass incarceration. The US has the second-highest rate at 127 per 100,000. India, by comparison, incarcerates just  
3 women per 100,000.

Globally, these rates are rising. The US imprisons eight times as many women as it did in 1980. Thirty percent of the world’s incarcerated women are in US prisons. Analysts point to America’s war on drugs to explain the increase. The mandatory minimum sentences and tough-on-crime law enforcement policies have had lasting social consequences and escalated incarceration rates for both men and women.

The total world prison population has increased by about 20 percent since 2000, but that growth has disproportionately affected women. According to a report from the Institute for Criminal Policy Research, a London-based research and advocacy group, more than 700,000 women and girls were held in prisons throughout the world in 2015. That number has increased by about 50 percent since 2000. (In that same time period, the world’s population grew by just 18 percent.)

Female incarceration rates rose highest in Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, with dramatic increases in Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, Colombia, Cambodia, and Indonesia. The offenses that send women to prison are often closely linked to poverty, with many women resorting to low-level, high-risk crime to support their families.

Thailand’s high female incarceration rate is rooted in some of the same causes as other countries. “The reason is probably our drug laws,” says Chontit Chuenurah, a policy analyst for the Thailand Institute of Justice, a government agency that oversees the prison system. “We got that model from the United States. We base the charge on the quantity of drugs.”

Thailand has long been a hub for drug trafficking. The country was once part of the opium-growing Golden Triangle. Now synthetic drugs are king. Methamphetamine tablets called *ya ba*, or “crazy medicine,” are rampant. Thailand’s 14-year-old war on drugs has filled its prisons, but failed to decrease drug use. Seventy percent of Thailand’s male prisoners and 82 percent of female prisoners are serving sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, according to a recent report by the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights.

“Most of the time they’re not big-time drug dealers,” Ms. Chontit adds. “We have harsh laws for drugs, but at the end of the day we have small-time drug dealers in prison.” 

According to the Thailand Institute of Justice, the vast majority of women prisoners are mothers and the primary caregivers for their children. Most are first-time offenders serving two- to five-year senten­ces. Few have finished high school.

Imprisoning women creates ripples throughout Thai society, but is most keenly felt by children. “When women go to prison, the men often leave,” Chontit says. “Children leave school early. They are vulnerable to abuse. Some end up in prison themselves.”

As a result of high incarceration rates, Thailand’s prisons are at 224 percent capa­city, according to the International Federation for Human Rights. 

The staff-to-prisoner ratio in Thailand’s women prisons is 1 to 20, far worse than the internationally recommended level of 1 to 3. And while the International Committee of the Red Cross advises at least 37 square feet of personal space per prisoner, the Thai Department of Corrections mandates less than 12 square feet for women. In practice, many prisoners get only half that.

Overcrowding was just one of the realities Prontip chronicled during her time in prison. The crowded conditions made for easy transmission of disease, but health care was limited. Prontip says she saw three people die from untreated conditions.

“Some people die and nobody knows,” she says. “There’s no value. They just die.” 

Prontip’s cell had two ceiling fans, but in summer it got so hot that the inmates smeared themselves with camphor to stay cool. In winter the cold seeped up from the floor. And in the wet season, rain swept into the cell through the barred windows. 

Her fellow inmates were women of all ages. The youngest was 14, although her paperwork listed her as 20 so she could stay with her mother, who was also in prison. The oldest was 88. She couldn’t move. Prontip says other prisoners had to carry her wherever she went. 

Prontip quickly learned that although the guards controlled the prison officially, the real power rested with the *meh bahn*, or “mother of the house,” the lead prisoner who served as an informant to prison staff. Prisoners who crossed her could lose their visitor privileges or access to the doctor. 

“She treated us like slaves,” Prontip says. “We couldn’t walk up to her to ask something. We had to crawl on our knees and sit like we would at a temple. If we wanted to go to the toilet, we had to ask her first.” 

Prontip saw fights between prisoners. Occasionally the guards would tell one prisoner to beat up another. There were also love triangles. Some women set up little families and played roles of father, mother, and children. When women were caught having sex, guards would pour water on them and make them stand in direct sunlight all day.

In accordance with prison policy, Prontip could only receive visits from a list of 10 approved people. Prisoners are often incarcerated far from their hometowns, making family visits time-consuming and expensive. Prisoners are strip-searched before and after visits, a practice discouraged by prisoner rights groups. All inmate correspondence is censored. 

Prontip’s life improved when she learned that she could buy better treatment. If she paid 500 baht ($14) a month to the right prisoner, she could shower longer. She could get a foot and a half of sleeping space. She could go to the toilet when she wanted. And if she gave coffee to the prisoner who oversaw the washroom, she would get enough water to wash her clothes. 

Prontip’s other survival mechanism was mental. “I gave myself a mission every day,” she says. “Maybe I needed to learn something, or find something. Maybe I had a meeting. Some days I’d steal a book from the library. Some days I’d take a pen or a paper cutter. If you have a pen or a paper cutter, no one wants to have a problem with you.”

Ironically, Thailand is credited with helping draft the first international standards for the fair treatment of women prisoners. 

That effort began when Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol, granddaughter of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, visited the Central Women’s Correctional Institution in 2001. The visit inspired her to start charitable programs to improve conditions for women inmates. Those programs became the basis for 70 rules outlining the humane treatment of women prisoners, which the United Nations adopted in 2010. Because of the princess’s work, the guidelines are called The Bangkok Rules.

Thailand’s women’s prisons currently violate many of The Bangkok Rules. Because they were never adopted into Thai law, the rules have no legal teeth. And when the Thailand Institute of Justice interviewed senior prison staff in 2014, some didn’t fully understand what The Bangkok Rules were. 

Ms. Pornpen says Thai prisons have very little oversight from nongovernmental organizations. Access to prisons became even more difficult after the 2014 coup. More transparency would help, she says, but the surest way to improve conditions in women’s prisons is to imprison fewer women. 

Thailand has yet to implement recommendations to reduce its population of women prisoners, such as substituting fines for lesser offenses, using electronic monitoring for pretrial detainees and parolees, or giving judges more discretion in sentencing. 

“The court has limited options,” says Chontit, from the Thailand Institute of Justice. “They follow the law. That’s why we need to change the law.”

Eventually, Prontip benefited from the one method Thailand does use to reduce its prison population – the royal pardon. Every year on royal birthdays, the sentences of eligible prisoners are commuted. Prontip received a pardon and was released five months early. 

Last August, Prontip walked out of prison conflicted. She was free, but her friends inside were not. In January, I met her in a gated house in north Bangkok. As we sat on cushions on a tiled floor, she told me about her imprisonment. 

Prontip doesn’t look like an ex-con. She has shoulder-length black hair, a bright smile, and a playful nature that makes her seem younger than her 28 years. She is an artist and a playwright. And now she’s a vocal campaigner for prison reform in Thailand. She recently submitted a report on Thai prisons to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. It was based on her own all-too-personal experience.

Even as a former political prisoner, Prontip continues to advocate democratic changes in Thailand, in spite of the risks. Besides writing a book about Thai prison conditions, she’s started a group to support women inmates after they are released. Prontip is also active in pro-democracy social movements. She recently spoke at the Asian Youth Leadership Forum for Democracy conference in Gwangju, South Korea. 

“The democracy movement is a marathon,” she told the audience. “I plan to help prepare young activists to be effective political prisoners, productive political refugees, and also to support those who are released. I have to tell them that imprisonment can’t destroy our ideologies and spirit.”  

Prontip’s own prison sentence may be behind her, but she’s not turning her back on the women in prison in Thailand. 

“I have many friends in there,” she says. “I can’t leave them behind.”

1m4wjau,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m4wjau/the_perfect_tuesday/,The Perfect Tuesday,"The last truly perfect night of my life was a Tuesday. I didn't know it at the time, of course. You never do. It was just a normal Tuesday. 
I remember the smell of garlic and basil hanging in the air from the pasta Tessa had made for dinner. I remember the sound of our son, Caleb, shrieking with laughter as I chased him around the living room coffee table, his little feet slapping against the hardwood floor. It was that perfect kind of ordinary chaos. After his bath, he smelled like lavender soap and damp hair, and he was warm and heavy in my arms as I read him a story about a bear who couldn't sleep. Tessa was already on the couch when I came out, scrolling through her phone with her feet tucked under her. The TV was on, some home renovation show we weren't really watching. The apartment was quiet except for the low hum of the fridge. I sat down next to her, and she rested her head on my shoulder. This was it. This was everything. That simple, quiet peace after the whirlwind of a toddler's bedtime.
 
""You're smiling,"" she murmured, not looking up from her phone. 

""Just happy,"" I said. 

She looked up at me then. ""Yeah? What about?"" 
And right then, it happened. As I opened my mouth to answer, a crystal-clear memory that wasn't a memory at all played in my head. I saw myself saying, ""This. Just this."" I saw her smile. I saw myself reach for the glass of water on the coffee table and saw my hand knock it over, a dark circle spreading across the oak wood. 
The vision was so real, so complete, that I flinched. 

""Owen? You okay?"" Tessa's voice pulled me back. 

I stared at her, my heart suddenly beating way too fast. I hadn't answered her yet. The water was still on the table, untouched. 

""What's wrong?"" she asked, her brow furrowed with concern. 

""Nothing,"" I managed to say, forcing a laugh. ""Zoned out for a second."" I tried to piece together what just happened. It felt exactly like hitting play on a video a half-second before you were supposed to. 

I needed to break the script. I needed to prove it was just a weird brain fart. So instead of saying what I'd seen in the vision, I said, ""Thinking about that bear. Seemed pretty stressed out for a 
cartoon."" 

Tessa gave me a weird look, but she smiled. ""Okay then."" 

I felt a small sense of victory. See? It was nothing. I reached for the glass of water, extra careful this time. My fingers wrapped around it, cool and solid. But as I brought it toward me, a jolt, like a tiny electric shock, went up my arm. My hand spasmed. The glass tipped, and cold water spilled across the coffee table, soaking a magazine. 

We both looked at the puddle, then at each other. 
""Clumsy,"" I said, my voice sounding hollow to my own ears. 

""Owen, you're white as a sheet,"" Tessa said, getting up to grab a towel. ""You sure you're okay? 

You look like you've seen a ghost."" 
I helped her clean up the water, telling her I was just tired, that work was stressful. But later that night, as I lay in bed next to her, listening to the soft rhythm of her breathing, I couldn't sleep. I could feel it, deep inside my head. A low, silent hum. A vibration that felt like it was shaking my teeth. 

The static had started. And I was completely, terrifyingly alone with it. 

I woke up the next morning to the smell of coffee. My first thought was, Wednesday. I had a big project deadline, and I needed to get an early start. 

Tessa walked into the bedroom, holding two mugs, a smile on her face. ""Morning, sleepyhead,"" she said. ""You looked so peaceful I didn't want to wake you."" 

A cold dread washed over me. She had said that before. Not last week, not last month. 
Recently. Very recently. The deja vu was so thick it felt like I was choking on it. 

""What day is it?"" I asked, my voice raspy. 
""It's Tuesday, silly,"" she said, handing me a mug. ""Big day for you at work, right?"" 

I stared at her. Tuesday. It couldn't be Tuesday. Yesterday was Tuesday. I lived it. I remembered it. I remembered spilling the water. I remembered the static. 

""No,"" I said, sitting up. ""No, yesterday was Tuesday. Today is Wednesday."" 

Her smile faltered, replaced by that look of gentle concern I was already starting to hate. ""Honey, you must have had a really weird dream. It's definitely Tuesday. Caleb's got that playgroup thing at ten."" 

I grabbed my phone from the nightstand. The screen lit up, bright and unforgiving. Under the time, it read: Tuesday, 8:15 AM. 

I felt dizzy. I swung my legs out of bed and walked into the living room. The TV was on, tuned to the morning news. The anchor was talking about a traffic jam on the interstate, a multi-car pileup. The same report from yesterday morning. I remembered the detail about a truck spilling its cargo of oranges all over the highway. A moment later, the anchor said it. Oranges, rolling across three lanes of traffic. 

I went through the day in a fog. Every conversation was an echo. Every event was a rerun. I knew Tessa would suggest pasta for dinner. I knew Caleb would want to watch the same cartoon about the talking dog. I knew he would trip on the corner of the rug at exactly 3:42 PM. I watched the clock tick towards the time, my heart pounding. I wanted to scream, to tell him not to run through the living room. But what could I say? How could I explain it? 

At 3:41, I stood up. ""Hey, buddy,"" I said, my voice tight. ""Let's go build a pillow fort in your room."" Caleb's face lit up. ""Yeah!"" 

He ran towards his bedroom instead of through the living room. He didn't trip. I felt a surge of relief so powerful it almost made my knees buckle. I could change things. I wasn't just a passenger. 

That night, after we put Caleb to bed, I told Tessa I was feeling sick. I couldn't face the couch, the TV show, the glass of water. The thought of reliving that moment again made my skin crawl. ""You've been acting so strange lately, Owen,"" she said, her hand on my forehead. ""You don't have a fever. Maybe you're just stressed. You've been working so hard."" 

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""Just stressed."" 

I woke up the next morning. The smell of coffee filled the air. Tessa walked in, holding two mugs. 
""Morning, sleepyhead,"" she said. 

My heart sank into my stomach. It was Tuesday again. 

The third Tuesday was when the migraines started. It began with the static, that familiar, awful hum. But this time, it didn't fade. It grew, twisting into a sharp, stabbing pain behind my right eye. The deja vu was constant, a roaring waterfall of memory that made it hard to focus on the present. Or, what was supposed to be the present. 

I spent most of the day in our darkened bedroom, a cold cloth over my eyes. Tessa was worried sick. She brought me water and crackers. She kept her voice low. She was the perfect, caring wife. And that was the problem. Her concern felt… rote. Her lines were always the same. Her actions were predictable because I had already seen them twice before. 

""I'm calling Dr. Miller,"" she said in the afternoon, her voice a worried whisper from the doorway. ""This isn't just a headache, Owen. Something's wrong."" 

I knew she would say that. I knew he wouldn't have any appointments. I knew she would hang up, frustrated, and say he could squeeze me in next week. I lived through the whole conversation from the other room, my head exploding with pain. 

That night, I couldn't take it anymore. I had to tell her. I had to have someone else in this nightmare with me. 

""Tessa,"" I said, my voice weak. We were in the living room. I had forced myself out of bed. ""We need to talk."" 

I tried to explain. I told her about the days repeating. I told her I knew what she was going to say before she said it. I told her today was Tuesday, and so was yesterday, and so was the day before. 

She listened patiently, her face a mask of love and deep, deep worry. She held my hand. ""Oh, honey,"" she said, her voice soft and soothing. ""You're not well. The stress from your job, it's all getting to you. Sometimes when we're exhausted, our brains can play tricks on us. It's okay. We'll get through it."" 

She wasn't listening. She was handling me. She was a program running a script labeled ""Comfort Distressed Husband."" She was dismissing the single most terrifying and important discovery of my life as a symptom of overwork. 
I felt a chasm open between us. I was completely and utterly alone. 

The next Tuesday, the fourth, or the fifth, I was starting to lose count, I gave up on trying to explain. I just tried to live. I tried to find the seams in the simulation. I focused on the little details. The way the light hit the dust motes dancing in the air. The specific pattern of the wood grain on our dining table. I was trying to find something real, something that didn't feel like a cheap copy of the day before.

I spent the afternoon on the floor, playing trains with Caleb. The migraine was a dull throb today, manageable. I let the simple joy of it wash over me. The click of the plastic wheels on the wooden track. Caleb's delighted laugh when the red engine would crash into the blue one. For a couple of hours, I almost forgot. I was just a dad playing with his son. 

""I love you, Daddy,"" he said, out of the blue, leaning over to give me a hug. 

""I love you too, buddy,"" I said, holding him tight. 
And in that moment, the static roared. A memory, sharp and brutal, hit me. Caleb, leaning just like that, but too far. The train track slipping under his hand. His forehead hitting the sharp corner of the coffee table. 

I reacted without thinking. I grabbed him, pulling him back from the table just as his hand slipped on the track. His head missed the corner by an inch. 

He looked at me, confused. ""What'd you do that for?"" 

""Careful,"" I said, my voice shaking. ""Don't want you to get a bonk on the head."" 

He just shrugged and went back to his trains. But I was reeling. It was different from the spilled water. I hadn't just predicted it; I had prevented it. I had intervened. I felt a spark of hope. Maybe I wasn't just a prisoner. Maybe I could be a guardian. Maybe my curse was to know the future of this single, repeating day, and my purpose was to protect my family from all its tiny, hidden dangers. 

That night, I didn't sleep. I sat in the dark of the living room, long after Tessa had gone to bed. The hope I had felt earlier was curdling into something else. Fear. I had saved Caleb from a bump on the head. But what if something worse was coming? What if the day kept repeating because it had to, until some terrible, final event was allowed to play out? 

I looked around the apartment, this place I had once thought of as a sanctuary. Now it felt like a stage. A set, designed for a play that was performed over and over for an audience of one. And I was the only actor who knew it was all fake. 

I needed proof. Not just for me, but for… I don't know who. For the universe. I needed one, solid, undeniable piece of evidence that would survive the reset. A message in a bottle, thrown into the ocean of tomorrow. 

I walked into Caleb’s room. He was fast asleep, his chest rising and falling softly. On his windowsill, a collection of little plastic army men stood guard. I picked one up. A green soldier, his plastic rifle broken off at the tip. 

I held it in my palm. It felt real. It felt solid. 

I went to our bedroom, opened my sock drawer, and buried the little green man deep in the back, under a tangled mess of black and gray socks. 
I checked my phone. 11:58 PM. 

I lay down in bed, my heart pounding a frantic rhythm against my ribs. I didn't close my eyes. I just watched the numbers on the clock tick over to midnight, waiting for the world to reboot.  
I woke up to the smell of coffee. 
For a single, blissful second, my first thought was Wednesday. Then the cold reality crashed back in. The memory of the little green army man, buried deep in my sock drawer. 
I didn't move. I just lay there, listening. I heard Tessa walk into the bedroom. I heard the clink of ceramic mugs. 

""Morning, sleepyhead,"" she said, her voice bright and cheerful. ""You looked so peaceful I didn't want to wake you."" 

The words were just noise. My entire focus was on the drawer across the room. I sat up and took the mug from her hand, my movements stiff. ""Just tired,"" I said. 

I waited. I waited through the morning routine, through the news report about the traffic jam and the spilled oranges, through Caleb's breakfast. I waited until Tessa was in the shower and Caleb was sitting on the living room floor, engrossed in his cartoons. My heart was a cold, heavy lump in my chest. This was it. 

I walked into our bedroom. The air felt thick, charged with a strange energy. I went to my dresser, my hands shaking so badly I could barely grip the handle. I pulled the sock drawer open. 

It was just socks. A tangled mess of black and gray, but nothing else. I dug my hands in, frantically searching, my breath catching in my throat. I pulled everything out, throwing socks onto the floor. The drawer was empty. 
My legs felt like they were going to give out. I leaned against the dresser, my head spinning. I stumbled out of the bedroom and into Caleb’s room. He didn't look up from where he was playing on the floor. I walked to the window, my eyes tracing the line of the sill where the moonlight had been last night. 
And there it was. 

Standing in its designated spot, perfectly in line with the others. The green army man, his little plastic rifle still broken at the tip. 

I sank to the floor, my back against the wall. The proof didn't make me feel certain. It made me feel insane. My mind scrambled for an explanation, anything to hold onto. Did Tessa find it? No. No way. She'd have to have gone through my personal drawer in the middle of the night and known exactly where to put it back. It made no sense. 

Did I move it? Did I get up in the middle of the night, sleepwalking, and put it back myself? Am I losing time? Having blackouts? The thought was terrifying. The idea that my own body was betraying me, doing things without my knowledge, was almost worse than the alternative. Because the alternative was impossible. That the world had reset. That time had folded back on itself. That an object had teleported from my drawer to the windowsill by a force I couldn't comprehend. People don't think that way. The human brain isn't built to accept that kind of reality. 

So I was left with two options: either I was completely and utterly losing my mind, or the laws of physics had decided to take a personal vacation inside my apartment. I didn't know which was scarier. 

After that, I couldn't trust anything. Especially myself. 

The Tuesdays continued. I lost count. Were there five more? Ten? The days blurred into one long, continuous loop of the same conversations, the same meals, the same cartoons. My confidence was gone. I second-guessed every action, every memory. Did I really just have that conversation with Tessa, or am I remembering it from a previous loop? Did Caleb really just say that, or is my broken brain playing tricks? 

I stopped trying to find proof. I had my proof, and it had proven nothing except that the problem was unsolvable. My family life dissolved. I was a ghost in my own home, my mind consumed by the mystery. I would sit at the dinner table, pushing food around my plate, while Tessa and Caleb's conversations faded into background noise.
 
""Owen, you're a million miles away,"" Tessa would say, her voice laced with a worry that felt more and more distant to me. 
I was. I was in a world of impossible soldiers and men who floated. How could I ever explain that to her? Every time I looked at her, at Caleb, a new, terrible thought began to creep in. If the world could do this, if objects could move, then what was real? Were they real? Or were they just part of the same impossible magic trick? 
That thought was a poison. And it was starting to spread. 

I became obsessed with the only other impossible thing in my life: the gliding man. He was the only piece of the puzzle that didn't fit. Was he connected? Was he causing this? Was he some kind of hypnotist playing a sick game? Or was he just another symptom of my breakdown, a recurring hallucination I had cooked up to explain the unexplainable? 
He was my only lead. I started watching him, not as a warden, but as a suspect. I would spend hours at the window, trying to see him, trying to understand. The static in my head always seemed to hum louder when he was near. That had to mean something. 

One Tuesday, I was watching him from the living room window. He was across the street, a motionless silhouette. Tessa came up behind me and put her arms around my waist. 
""What are you always looking at out there?"" she asked softly. 

""Just watching the world go by,"" I lied. 

""There's no one out there, Owen."" 

I blinked. I looked at her, then back out the window. The figure was gone. The street was empty. 

But I had been looking right at him. 
""He was just there,"" I said, my voice barely a whisper. ""A man in a dark cloak."" 

Tessa's arms tightened around me. ""Honey, there was no one there. I was watching too. Please. 
I'm so worried about you."" 

Did she not see him? Or was he never there at all? The doubt was a heavy, pressing down on me. 

The glitches started getting worse after that. Small things, at first. I was watching the figure from the window as it glided past a row of parked cars. As it passed, the reflection of the sky in the car windows didn't move. The clouds were frozen, just for the few seconds the figure was in frame. Another time, I was watching a flock of pigeons in the park near where it stood. The birds were all moving in a perfect, synchronized loop, a three-second animation that played over and over. 

Was I seeing things? Or was the world itself starting to fray at the edges? My obsession with the figure seemed to make things worse, as if by watching it, I was somehow pulling on a loose thread and unraveling the whole tapestry. 
The breaking point came on a Tuesday that felt like the hundredth. I had to get out of the apartment. I felt like the walls were starting to breathe, and I knew if I stayed in there, I'd go crazy for real. I needed to see normal people doing normal things. I needed to see if the world still worked right when I wasn't looking at it through a window. 

""I'm going for a walk,"" I announced, pulling on my shoes. 

""Owen, it's late,"" Tessa said, her voice tired. We'd had the same argument a dozen times. ""Can't it wait until morning?"" ""No,"" I said. ""It can't."" 
I pushed past her before she could protest further. I didn't look at Caleb, who was watching from the living room doorway with wide, scared eyes. I just had to get out. 

I took the stairs, needing the physical exertion. I burst out onto the street. It was a bright, sunny afternoon. The world was alive. Cars were moving, people were walking and talking on their phones. It was all so perfectly, beautifully normal. A wave of hope washed over me. Maybe it was just the apartment. Maybe the sickness was in the walls, not in my head. 

I stood on a busy street corner, waiting for the light to change, just letting the normalcy wash over me. And then the static started in my head. That low, familiar buzz. 

First, the sound of the city got weird. It didn't get quiet, exactly. It just... thinned out. Like turning down the bass on a stereo until all you have is the whiny, screeching treble. 

That’s when I noticed the mailman across the street had stopped walking. He was frozen, one foot on the curb, hand halfway to a mailbox. Then a woman pushing a stroller a few feet away from me also stopped. Just stood there, motionless. 

My heart started hammering. What the hell? I thought. What is this? 

Then, in perfect, silent unison, they turned. 
Not just them. Everyone. The mailman, the woman with the stroller, a businessman reading his phone, a group of teenagers who had been laughing a second ago. Every single person on that street stopped what they were doing and slowly, with a smooth, mechanical precision, turned their heads to face me. 
Maybe thirty people. All staring. 
And their faces were blank. Completely empty. You know those old, creepy dolls with the glass eyes? It was like that. There was no anger, no curiosity. There was nothing. Just these hollow, soulless eyes, all locked on me. They weren't people anymore. They were just things, and I was the most interesting bug in the jar. 
The silence was absolute. A whole city block, and the only sound I could hear was the blood roaring in my own ears. 

I stumbled back, tripping over a crack in the sidewalk. The spell, or whatever it was, broke. As soon as I moved, they all snapped back to normal. Just like that. The mailman put the letter in the box. The woman started pushing the stroller again. The sound of the city rushed back in at full volume. 

No one looked at me. No one seemed to realize that for ten solid seconds, they had all been puppets in some horrifying, silent play. 
I didn't run. Where could I go? I turned around and walked back to my apartment building, my legs shaking. The sickness wasn't in the apartment. The sickness was everywhere. It wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't a breakdown. The world was broken. And I was the only one who could see it. 

I stumbled back into the apartment and slammed the door, throwing the deadbolt with a loud, final click. My back slid down the door until I was sitting on the floor, my head in my hands. Tessa rushed over, her face a mask of fear. ""Owen! What happened? You look like you've seen a ghost."" 

I just laughed. A dry, humorless sound that scraped its way out of my throat. ""Not a ghost,"" I whispered. ""Something worse."" 
I didn't try to explain. What was the point? The prison wasn't just the apartment; it was the whole world. The people outside weren't real. They were puppets. And the gliding man, the thing with the skull face, was the one pulling the strings. 
After that day, I didn't go out again. The loops continued, but I was done playing. I was a prisoner on death row, and my only remaining power was to choose the terms of my own destruction. I couldn't live in the lie, and I couldn't escape it. But I could break it. I could smash the dollhouse. 

The next Tuesday, I waited until late afternoon. Tessa was in the kitchen, humming as she started dinner. Caleb was in the living room, watching his cartoons. The scene was perfectly, peacefully domestic. It was the energy the creature fed on. And I was about to poison the meal. I walked into the living room, picked up the heavy oak coffee table, and threw it against the wall with a splintering crash. 

Caleb shrieked in terror. Tessa ran in from the kitchen, her face white with shock. ""Owen! What are you doing?!"" 

I didn't answer. I grabbed a floor lamp and smashed it into the television. The screen exploded in a shower of sparks and glass. The static in my head roared, becoming a physical pressure. 

The lights in the apartment began to flicker violently. 

""Owen, stop! You're scaring him! You're scaring me!"" Tessa screamed, grabbing Caleb and pulling him back towards the kitchen. 
I picked up a dining chair and hurled it through the living room window. The glass shattered, and the sound of the outside world, the traffic, the sirens, went silent. The hole in the window didn't show the street below. It showed a swirling, black void, like television static. 

The illusion was breaking. 

The walls of the apartment began to dissolve, like a watercolor painting left out in the rain. The floor beneath my feet flickered, the familiar hardwood pattern wavering to show glimpses of dust-caked, neglected floorboards underneath. The loving scent of Tessa's cooking was replaced by the thick, choking smell of stale air and decay. 
Tessa and Caleb were wavering too, their forms becoming transparent. Their panicked screams stretched and warped, becoming a sound that wasn't human anymore, like a tape player slowing down to a stop. 

The world cracked like glass and then exploded into a billion points of light, leaving me in a screaming, silent void. I was falling. And then I landed. 

The landing wasn't hard, it was a dusty, wheezing gasp.

I opened my eyes. 

I was in my own bed. The sheets, once clean and comforting in the simulation, were now gray with filth and damp with my own sweat. The air was thick and smelled of stale air and sickness. A sliver of gray light cut through a grimy window, illuminating my own bedroom, now a squalid prison I didn't recognize. 

My body felt alien. I was a skeleton held together by tight, papery skin. My throat was sandpaper. How had I survived this long? The question was a fleeting, impossible thought. 

Then, a sound from the corner of the room. A soft, wet, clicking noise. 
My head turned slowly, every muscle screaming in protest. Unfolding itself from the deepest shadows was the Figure. 

It wasn't gliding anymore. It was real and physical. It moved with a jerky, stop-motion horror, like an insect trying to remember how to be a man. It was tall and unnaturally thin, its gaunt, yellowed face a mask of starvation. The two points of light in its hollow eye sockets fixed on me. They burned brighter now, filled with a furious, hateful hunger. 

It took a slow, twitching step toward me, its joints popping. I was too weak to move, to scream. I could only lie there, watching my death approach. This was it. I had escaped the dream only to die in the nightmare. 

It loomed over my bed, its shadow falling across my face. It raised a long, three-jointed arm. But then it stopped. It tilted its head with a sound like cracking wood. It seemed to analyze me, lying there, a broken, useless thing. The fight was gone. The rich emotional energy it had been feeding on was gone, replaced by the flat, dull signal of near-death. The meal was over. The toy was broken. 

With a final look of what I can only interpret as profound, ancient indifference, the creature turned away. It didn't need to be scared off. It was simply finished with me. It flowed to the wall, its body seeming to lose its solidity, becoming flat and distorted like a shadow in a warped mirror. It poured itself into a crack near the floorboards, a space no bigger than my thumb, and was gone. 
I was alone. I had won. And I was going to die here. 

The thirst was the first agony. The hunger was a dull, constant fire in my gut. But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was the silence. 
In the quiet of that filthy room, my mind replayed the memories. The ""perfect Tuesday."" I could see Caleb's face, flushed with laughter. I could hear Tessa's voice. I could feel the weight of my son asleep on my chest. 

How do you mourn people who never existed? It's an impossible, crazy-making grief. My heart physically ached with loss for a woman who was never born and a little boy who was nothing more than a psychic puppet. I cried, but my body was so dehydrated that no tears would come out. I was just a dry husk, grieving for ghosts. 
I tried to call for help, but the only sound that came out was a dry, rasping click. I tried to move, to crawl, but my muscles wouldn't obey. Life was happening just a few feet away, on the other side of the walls, but it might as well have been on another planet. 

The sun set on the first real day I'd experienced in months. I lay in the darkness, listening to the sounds of the city, waiting to die. Then the sun rose again. I was still there, weaker than before, my hope dwindling to nothing. I had survived the monster just to starve to death in its lair. It was on the afternoon of that second day that a new sound cut through my delirium. A hard, official knock on my apartment door. 

BANG! BANG! BANG! 

I thought it was another hallucination. A memory. 
""Police!"" a man's voice yelled. ""Request for a wellness check on Owen!"" 

The voice was real and was loud. It was from the world I couldn't reach. I tried to answer, but couldn't make a sound. I heard another voice, the building manager, saying something about not having heard from me in weeks, that my sister called. 

There was the sound of a key in the lock. The door swung open, flooding the filthy room with the bright, clean light of the hallway. A uniformed officer stepped in, his face shifting from professional readiness to shock as he saw the state of the room, and the skeletal man lying in the bed. 

He didn't see the monster that had just slithered into the walls. He just saw a man who had suffered a catastrophic breakdown, wasting away in his own apartment. 

My sister's worry is what saved my life. That simple, mundane act of love from the real world was the only thing that could have stopped it. 
I woke up in a hospital. The world was a blur of doctors and nurses, of clean sheets and the steady, rhythmic beep of a machine. 

A cardiologist came in one morning. He had a clipboard and an air of detached professionalism. ""Good morning, Owen,"" he said, his eyes scanning a paper on his clipboard. ""We've analyzed your EKG and echocardiogram results."" 

He looked at me over the top of the chart. ""You have a severe case of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Your heart's left ventricle is significantly enlarged, and the muscle wall has thinned, which is causing systolic dysfunction."" 
He paused, letting the technical terms hang in the air before translating. ""Basically, your heart is weak, and it's struggling to pump effectively. We're attributing the primary cause to the state of prolonged malnutrition you were in."" 

He made a note on his chart, and for a second I thought that was it. But then he continued, a slight frown appearing on his face. 

""What is atypical, however, is the accompanying electrical disruption. The arrhythmia is complex. We're seeing patterns that we can't fully account for, even with the severity of your condition."" He tapped his pen on the clipboard. ""For now, our focus is on stabilization. We'll be starting you on a regimen of beta-blockers and diuretics to manage the symptoms."" I just nodded. He saw the creature's footprint. That ""atypical"" electrical chaos was the scar tissue left behind by the parasite, a phantom fingerprint that no medical textbook could ever explain. 

The worst part was the psychiatrist. A kind woman who wanted me to accept that Tessa and Caleb were ""manifestations of a detailed delusion,"" a coping mechanism my mind had created. She wanted me to kill them all over again. She wanted me to let go of the only proof I have that any of it was real to me. 

I met with her this morning. I told her I was starting to understand that Tessa and Caleb weren't real. I told her I knew the memories were just part of the sickness. I saw the relief on her face. 

She told me I was making a breakthrough, that acceptance was the first step to recovery. 
She thinks I'm getting better. 
But I'm just learning how to lie. I'm building a new wall, not of routine, but of silence. I will take the medicine. I will do the therapy. I will learn to smile and nod and pretend to be a man recovering from a breakdown. I will tell them the monster is gone. 

But I will keep Tessa and Caleb safe inside me. Their memory is the only thing I have left.",13,1753036815.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

**Khamrah Qahwa** \- Arabian coffee + Praline + Cinnamon. Comfort in a bottle, I love wearing this but it's hard to pull off during humid nights. I only do 2 sprays max because this shit's too nuclear. 10/10

**Lattafa Fakhar** \- Sweeter/shower-gelly than YSL Y, doesn't have the depth that the OG has but it's aight, dissappointing performance. Great dumb reach fragrance. 6/10

**Khadlaj Island** \- I don't know how, but Khadlaj did something that makes it smoother compared to Le Beau Le Parfum. I'd say it's 98% similar(?) but this one's smoother for some reason. Very very pina colada that turns into a coconut + vanilla dry down, great for summer. 9/10

1m4w8fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m4w8fn/does_the_keurig_kexpress_mint_truly_deliver_bold/,Does the Keurig K-Express Mint truly deliver bold coffee? Review inside!,"The **Keurig 5000377904 K-Express Mint Single Serve Brewer** has become a staple in my kitchen over the past few weeks, tackling everything from early-morning coffee runs to satisfying those late-night caffeine cravings. As someone who cherishes a good cup of joe and thrives on convenience, testing this single-serve coffee maker gave me plenty of insights—both delightful and frustrating. Its sleek “Mint” color caught my attention instantly, adding a refreshing pop to an otherwise neutral-toned kitchen.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The moment I unboxed this coffee maker, I was impressed by its modern design. It's compact, yet its mint glossy or metallic finish makes it an eye-catching appliance. Its dimensions (15""D x 7""W x 15""H) fit snugly on my countertop without hogging space, which is an important factor if you have a smaller kitchen, like me. The button-operated interface isn't just functional—it’s intuitive. Whether you're a coffee-making pro or a complete newbie, this machine holds your hand with simplicity while maintaining a high-end vibe.

**Functionality and Performance**  
What sold me immediately was its performance. Brewing coffee with the K-Express felt effortless; it even boasts a ""Fast & Fresh Brewed"" functionality that delivers an aromatic cup within minutes. A standout feature is the STRONG button, which significantly boosts the boldness of the coffee’s flavor. I’ve tested this with various K-Cup pods, and even loved how well it worked when I paired it with a reusable My K-Cup filter for my own freshly ground beans.

[Curious about Keurig 5000377904 K-Express Mint? Check price on Amazon here.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cck2vytx/)

**Good Aspects**  
The brewer packs a punch with several impressive aspects:  
- **Multiple Brew Sizes:** With options to make 8, 10, or 12 oz. servings, I could tailor each cup to suit my morning energy needs.  
- **Strong Brew Feature:** If you’re someone who needs an extra kickstart, this button is your best friend.  
- **42oz Removable Reservoir:** This feature saved me plenty of back-and-forth trips to refill water—handy when friends drop by.  
- **Travel Mug Compatibility:** I tested this with my 7-inch tall travel mug, and it fit snugly after removing the drip tray, making on-the-go caffeine fixes a breeze.  
- **Versatile Use:** Whether it’s regular coffee, hot cocoa, or tea, the brewer adapts effortlessly.

**Critiques**  
However, there are some limitations that you should keep in mind while considering this coffee maker:  
- The water reservoir isn’t transparent, making it hard to gauge water levels from a glance. I’ve occasionally started brewing only to realize I’d forgotten to refill it.  
- The STRONG brew feature elevates flavor but does slow down steeping time slightly, a small inconvenience when you’re in a rush.
- The machine can sometimes feel a bit noisy during brewing, which might disturb a quiet household.  
- For a pod-based system, you’ll want to invest in eco-friendly reusable pods if sustainability is a priority.

**Market Rivals**  
Considering its price bracket and features, this single-serve coffee maker faces competition from notable brands like Nespresso and Hamilton Beach. Nespresso machines often edge ahead for espresso enthusiasts due to their superior crema and robust flavors, but they fall short in affordability and multi-use flexibility. Meanwhile, Hamilton Beach Single Serve Coffee Makers position themselves as a more budget-friendly alternative with similar water tank capacities, yet Keurig wins with its overall aesthetic and the STRONG brew button. The mint finish and compact design of the K-Express also beat the often bulky designs that competitors tend to offer in this range.

**Value for Money**  
Cost-wise, this coffee maker sits comfortably between high-end luxury brewers and basic budget options. While it’s not cheap, I found it suitable for someone keen on balancing affordability and convenience without sacrificing quality. The reusable filter compatibility saves extra money down the road, as K-Cups can add up. You’re essentially paying for ease, aesthetic charm, and reliable performance, which justifies its reasonable price point.

We're both in our mid to late 30s, with similar childhoods, interests, etc. 

A couple of weeks ago her texts gradually began to shift from novel-length, emoji-filled sweet talking, to very short statements lacking in any sweet talk. I knew something was off, but still persisted. 

Last Sunday, we made a plan to meet up at 1pm for lunch and browsing local shops. She had a brunch thing beforehand, but said she would be done by 1pm. Cool.  Around 12pm, she texted saying they had been waiting forever for a table. I texted a bit after asking if they were still waiting on a table or if we were still meeting at 1pm.  Never heard back from her until almost 2pm, when she texted saying she 'really tried to text back sooner, but couldn't because the people she was with were nosey and they wanted to go to a shooting range after the meal'. Alright... I get it. Other plans. Nosey people. You couldn't step away to the bathroom for 10 seconds to say you wouldn't make our plans though? Gave it the benefit of the doubt though. 

Anyways. We work with the same company. There is a little Starbucks where we work. On Tuesday or Wednesday (I don't recall which right now), she wanted to meet up at the Starbucks before work. Great. However, she texted me during our agreed meeting time that she was caught up talking to some other people. Said it would just be a few minutes.  I waited 20 minutes, she never texted back or showed up, so I sent her a message saying I had to get to work. She texted maybe an hour later ""aw I'm sorry babe! I'm going for coffee now."" I was in a meeting at that time though.  

Alright. Give it one more shot. We made plans to meet for a movie at 11am today. Last night she was all for it. I even texted her this morning around 8:30am, and she immediately said yes, we're still on to meet.  Then around 10am, an hour before the show, she texts ""want to just do brunch or lunch or something later? I'm kind of exhausted.""   I told her I wasn't hungry and we'd just plan for another time. 

But really, the more that I think about it, the more I realize I have no desire to plan something with her again. I feel disrespected and unappreciated on all three accounts, truthfully.

I know she has things going on in her life. But so do I. I wasn't even feeling 100% well today, but still got up to shower and try to make the movie with her. People who want to spend time with you will make the effort. 

It sucks. I liked her. We got along well and had a lot of common ground. At this point, I think I'm missing what could have been. And wondering if this is how it will always be. ",8,1753035991.0,WLW,0,0.91,False

I’ll be travelling solo in mid September for 5 nights. Please can you give me any constructive feedback on my itinerary? I’ve been to NYC once about 10 years ago but looking to do still do typical tourist places this time. I’ve read a few threads and taken some other recommendations. 

Please let me know if there is something I must sacrifice to add in!! I’m not sure if I “must” check out soho or China town as I didn’t do these before but don’t know where to add them! Walking isn’t an issue, but will make use of the subway as much as possible. I like a museum but won’t spend hours there. I’m mindful of I’ll be solo so there’s only so much “chilling” I can do on my own in one place. Enjoy food, architecture, taking in scenery / people watching. I’ll be looking at adding in a broadway show one evening.

The ocean is huge, the crew is legendary, and Oda’s out here crafting epic tales like he’s just writing another day—but only ONE character can claim the title of the greatest of all time in One Piece.

Who’s it gonna be? And why is it definitely not the choice of the last person who spoke?

This isn’t a joke. I want your arguments. I want the hottest takes. I want full-on three-paragraph defenses of Brook like it’s your last chance at student loan forgiveness.

Let’s add some spice to the mix:

Zoro: The guy can’t find his way out of a paper bag but somehow navigated straight into your hearts. Also, he has a bit of a rivalry with stairs.

Sanji: Could be the noble knight or the ultimate simp. It all depends on the episode and how many cigarettes he’s had.

Nami: She’s probably stolen more than the government. The true MVP when it comes to controlling the weather.

Usopp: He lies, he weeps, he survives. This dude literally gaslit a mole woman until she couldn't take it anymore. What a legend.

Robin: Classy, lethal, and a bookworm. The gothic dream girl unless she happens to freak you out.

Luffy: Spins like a Beyblade, picks fights with deities, and doesn’t really read the room. Can’t help but love him.

Law: The Surgeon of Death, who’s got some serious emotional baggage. Fueled by vengeance and iced coffee.

Chopper: An adorable reindeer who’s got a PhD and can switch into bodybuilder mode. He can and will diagnose your emotional struggles.

Buggy: A literal clown, yet somehow still thriving.

And if you dare to say Carrot, you better come armed with charts, graphs, and a PowerPoint presentation. 🐰

So who truly is the best character and why?

1m4vwa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m4vwa2/i_20f_need_advice_with_my_relationship_of_one/,I 20F need advice with my relationship of one year with Bf 22M. TL;DR.,"this is going to be too long as i believe the details are necessary so hi, im 20 F and my boyfriend is 22 M. We both have been in a committed relationship since june 2024. A little background on our personal lives before we met eachother is that i was in an extremely toxic relationship with my now ex. He used to verbally and emotionally abuse me give me r**e threats and also actively blackmailed me by saying that he would harm my family members and i. He also hired a guy who would keep a track of wherever i was going and that guy also knew the numberplate of my dad's car. He would make me sleep on videocall from 8pm till 4am despite me having school at 7am. My mother knew about my relationship but not the dark side of it. I became extremely scidal and i had to breakup thru the help of a male friend which i had to claim was my ""brother's friend"". 

About my bf, he has never been in a relationship when we met he was more of a non chalant and emotionless guy. I always thought of him as a redflag. Anyways i told him about how my ex forced me into like being intimate with him we did everything but not s*x cuz he kept asking me till i gave in and let him have it it continued for three days with gaps and it left me traumatized and hadi knows about it so after we got together and we decided to be intimate for fhe first time ever he was really reallg scared to touch me despite me letting him know im comfortable yet i could feel the nervousness in his breath and his touch. he made me feel amazing he was gentle so gentle i felt like crying he was so careful he kept asking if i was okay after each minute whereas my ex knew i was a virgin and went wild on me and it led me to bleed and develop infection. 

it remained like that till december before that we would meet almost ever weekend or once a weekend in two weeks and we never had serious arguments and he used to tell me how scared he was of losing me and how acared he was of doing anything or saying anything that would remind me of my ex or would make him look like my ex he was genuinely scared of it and he didn't like that i sh and told me he never wants to be the reason for that so yes it was going amazing till december because he started his job in december. He is a CA student and his uni timings are 10am-6pm and job timing is 8 hours so as soon as he gets done w uni he goes straight to his job and comes back home at 4-5am. 

I get it its hectic for him but for the past two months things have been changing. I have gotten used to us not meeting as regularly as before, we meet once a month now before that we used to meet every weekend and he also started talking less cuz of his busy schedule which im totally okay with. But before that he used to talk to me for atleast a combined time of 45 mins i.e 5 mins once 15 mins next and 30mins all with breaks in between cuz he had lectures to attend and he cant use his phone much in office. Recently on june 29th it was our anniversary and i had been looking forward to it i had gotten gifts for him and it was all planned out till he told me he cannot meet cuz he has an exam. Apparently he has to complete 72 hours of some course which is why he has been taking uni classes on Saturday and sunday and after his classes he goes to play basketball with his friends. 

So i felt hurt really let down i asked him what time his exam would end he told me it would end at around 6:30 so i left my house at 6:30 and went to a cafe nearby that we sometimes meet at. I asked him to come now that he was done with his exam and he told me he cant he had not ""shaved"" (he remains clean shaved) this angered me and i calmly asked to go home and then come back. His house is not that far we both live in the same area just 5-10 mins away from eachother. He then refused and said he would meet me next week i got mad and told him i won't meet next week and he gave me the same attitude so i deactivated my account cuz i was really hurt and didnt feel like talking i felt embarrassed cuz i spent money to go to the cafe order an overpriced coffee just for him to not show up cuz he hadnt ""shaved"". Later he texted me on whatsapp ""wtf is this behaviour why would you deactivate"" and alot of ""?????"".

 I was expecting him to call me atleast. My friends were wishing me on my one year anniversary but my boyfriend? he didn't. I thought he would atleast stay home that day and talk to me properly spend time with me or play some game or watch a movie since we barely see eachother or talk to each other. But neither happened or atleast order some food for me to make up for it since he knows i feel happy when i eat my favorite food. I finally decided to text him the next day saying that i was leaving for my job training and he said i didnt have to keep him updated anymore then he decided to say lets breakup cuz its ""better for both of us"" and that ""we are both fucking up each other's mental health"". 

it broke me down i was at my job training trying not to cry snd kept asking him to shut up and that this breakup wont happen. So i left the job training and i havent gone there ever since it was going to be a great high paying job and step for me to become independent but i knew my mental health would not have allowed me to hustle when i had a great feeling that i wouldnt be able to move on from him trying give up on this relationship. 

On july 13th we finally decided to meet and hour before meeting i asked him if he had cut his hair and he replied no , i had been asking him to cut his hair days before we met because he doesnt even trim his hair and they stick out from his cap. he asked me he hadnt so i jokingly said ill bring a scissors then and he asked me why and stuff so i told him that if i put efforts in looking good then i expect the same from him to which he replied i make assumptions that he doesnt put effort etc and it escalated  to him saying i should go home and he doesnt feel like meeting anymore. 

He told me we are done in an indirect way and i told him idc if we are done or not he has to meet cuz i planned my whole day accordingly so i couldnt just go home so we met. There was silence bw us he sat opposite to me (we never ever sit opposite he always sits next to me) i told him "" i think there's alot of space beside me"" to which he replied ""its hot here"" later the silence continued till he saw my arm ( i had anxiously dug nails in my skin as a way to cope with my anxiety) he asked me what it was and then rubbed my hand trying to calm me, after that we left the cafe to go to our usual spot and during the car ride he kept trying to be close by holding my hand and hugging me and kept trying to make me look at him and when we reached our destination i tried to talk to him about the breakup and he said he doesnt wanna talk about it and will talk about it when he gets home after our date. 

I told him to talk now cuz ik on text he will suggest breaking up still he dismissed and the only thing he said was ""if i started loving you less it means i never loved you so dont think ive stopped loving you or that my love has reduced. I suggested breakup cuz at that moment we both are ruining each other's mental health so breaking up was the safest solution"" i was quiet, our date continued we were touchy and hugging eo but deep down i had this fear that it wont last long. So friday night he came home at 5 and i was up waiting so he asked me to sleep i said no i wanna talk he said we can talk tmrw i said no youll go out with your friends you wont talk to me he assured me that he will talk to me by taking some time out so i obliged and went to sleep. the next morning i kept waiting for his text and he texted me at 7pm saying he is going home. 

I asked where were you all this time he told me he had to visit a relative and then drop his parents back home so he couldnt text so i was like okay and waited for him to go home next. He then texted me at 9:50 saying ""hi"" i replied ""hi"" and then no response then i received a text of hi again at 10:43 and now i was pissed so i replied yeah and remained dry then i replied to his previous text of ""ill talk to you by taking some time out"" with ""yeah anyways"" he said ik i couldnt take time out i wasnt home i had to go here and there so i told him its fine if he couldnt talk but he couldve atleast informed me that he wouldnt be able to talk cuz of some errands instead of keeping me waiting that yay we are finally gonna talk. 

I need some advice now about how i should act or communicate because i have this ultimate fear that if i communicate my feelings he will try to breakup like he said last night ""One of us has to do it or this will continue"". Idk if iam that easy for him to give up on? is it that easy for him to suggest a breakup than fixing the problem? he used to thanks me for letting him know about how i was feeling regarding any of his actions and his biggest fear was making me cry or losing me. 

I want my baby back i hate this version of him who doesnt even care if i cry or if i even exist. I need to know most of this from the male pov. As ive tried understanding his busy life and schedule alot and ik how stressed he is.",2,1753035302.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
