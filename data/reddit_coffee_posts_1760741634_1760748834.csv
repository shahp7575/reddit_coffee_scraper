So basically I am Australian, 30, transgender, and have a well paying, secure job here and have a standard of living that is maybe a bit rare for someone like me. (Usually other trans women I know just work in like bars or cafes or are djs or swers etc) however I find it generally not very interesting and I feel a little bit unfulfilled, and I think I would like to try being an English teacher / tutor or something similar. I'm learning Spanish rn (I'm somewhere between A2-B1 atm judging from the kind of topics I'm covering w my tutor, or at least my writing is(?)) and would like to be fluent, and I'm generally in love w the language and language in general, and would like to share the experience of teaching & learning together with more people.

However I am generally a bit worried about professional/legal discrimination, the police, being like assaulted or harassed, which obviously can happen anywhere (it's happened to me here in the past) but I live in I guess a pretty trendy lgbt area in my city, and not to be vain or whatever but I pass pretty well, people generally consider me to be attractive etc (pretty privilege) so I get treated kinda good rn but I am aware that maybe I live in a bit of a bubble, and would like people to be real with me about my chances of teaching English outside of this little bubble. I asked my tutor and she said cities like Santiago, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, etc would maybe be best if I did want to try be a teacher but she wasn't really sure, she's from Ecuador and hadn't really met anyone transgender before, I think. I'm seeing a Colombian girl and she's said similar things. 

In terms of like culture etc I'm pretty easy to please and a bit adaptable. I like movies and art and fashion, coffee and drinking wine and having sex. Italian food. The Spanish language. I am vegan rn but open to being vegetarian when abroad. 

Is it a realistic enough dream for someone like me to want to pursue do you think? Would I get treated okay? Is it hard to say? 
I guess I'm scared of being an unemployable outcast. My life is comfortable rn but boring. I want to see more of the world, my country is so one dimensional.

1o9i3mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1o9i3mu/ebay_standard_envelope_problems/,eBay Standard Envelope problems,"I've noticed that always when it's the end of the year or when seasonal employees work, eBay standard envelope starts to have problems because they aren't trained with this sort of thing.

For example, last year I sent an 1 order with ESE and it was sent back to me because they thought it wasn't a valid label. I just sent it back with a new label and it was scanned. Maybe they didn't get their coffee.

Right now, I had an order with ESE saying ""not scannable, return to sender"". Dude I check the scanning label and it was scanned to my state now when I see the tracking so somebody is lying at USPS or didn't know.

This is so unreliable when it does deliver, half the time they don't even actually scan when they do get delivered.

Out of 100+ orders i've had around 3 sent back to me for ""insuffient postage, USPS slip ups, etc"" , 50 non scanned even with proper postage and probably a few buyers just lie that it never arrived to them.

The funny thing is that ESE usually does scan the first time as long as the QR code is readable but half the time doesn't scan the delivery. So that's not very helpful if it does half the job, almost makes you want to go back to stamps.

1o9hxz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1o9hxz4/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

---

A Love Letter to the Overhyped Coffee Shops I Pretend to Despise

You saw the Instagram post. The one with the perfect, milky swirl of a latte art pheasant, perched beside a ceramic plate holding a single, gloriously twisted pastry. The caption was something inscrutable, like ‚ÄúMorning ritual üåø #Á¨¨‰∏âÂúüÊõúÊó•‚Äù (Third Saturday, for the uninitiated normies). You knew, with a thrilling mix of dread and desire, that you had to go.

So you found yourself there. In that coffee shop. The one tucked down a repurposed shotengai alleyway, its name a single, lower-case English word that means nothing and everything. You slide the heavy, untreated oak door open, and the symphony begins.

The Overture: The Judgmental Scan

A bell doesn't tinkle here. The door makes a sound best described as a ‚Äútactile thunk.‚Äù Every head in the place‚Äîa sea of oversized glasses, unkempt bangs, and carefully curated vintage workwear‚Äîlifts in a single, fluid motion. Their eyes don‚Äôt meet yours. No, that would be too human. They perform a swift, holistic assessment: your shoes, your tote bag (is it a genuine Seican, or a sad imitation?), the model of your smartphone.

You have been weighed. You have been measured. And you have been found‚Ä¶ temporarily tolerable enough to occupy the same 12 square meters of airspace.

The Ritual: Brunch as Performance Art

You order. The menu is a handwritten scroll, the font a defiantly illegible script. You point to the ‚ÄúAvocado & Fermented Radish on Artisan Sourdough.‚Äù The barista, a vision in a Japanese interpretation of 1950s American diner attire, nods slowly, as if receiving a profound and slightly disappointing confession.

Then comes the food. And with it, The Knot.

You know The Knot. It‚Äôs not a simple cinnamon roll or a pragmatic croissant. It‚Äôs a knot. A complex, multi-layered, flour-dusted enigma that requires a PhD in structural engineering and the patience of a Zen monk to consume. You pick up your knife and fork. The entire room is a silent stage, and you are the lead actor in a play called ‚ÄúDeconstructing My Pastry Without Getting Crumbs on My Raw Selvedge Denim.‚Äù

You take a bite. It‚Äôs good. Actually, it‚Äôs transcendent. The bitterness of the single-origin, hand-poured Ethiopia Yirgacheffe perfectly complements the subtle sweetness of the knot. The avocado is, somehow, the most avocado an avocado has ever been. And this is the moment of your crisis.

The Epiphany: We Are the Bloody Pompous Wankers

Sitting there, carefully dissecting your meal, trying to look thoughtfully detached while secretly wanting to moan with pleasure, you have a horrifying realization.

You are one of them.

The heads that were once knotted in concentration over their own pastries? Your head is now similarly knotted. The performative sigh of contentment you just let out? Pure, unadulterated theatre. You‚Äôre not here for the coffee; you‚Äôre here for the vibe, for the unspoken membership to a club that prides itself on not wanting members.

We are all bloody pompous wankers, tangled in a beautiful, delicious, and utterly ridiculous web of our own making. We scoff at the Starbucks down the street while paying ¬•1,200 for a cup of coffee that tastes of ‚Äúapricot undertones and a hint of existential dread.‚Äù

And you know what? I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

There‚Äôs a perverse, soul-crushing, and deeply satisfying joy in this entire charade. It‚Äôs the joy of finding a place that feels, for a fleeting moment, like a secret. It‚Äôs the aesthetic pleasure of a perfectly composed interior, the quiet hum of a Taylor Swift song being played on a vintage Thorens turntable (the ultimate hipster irony), the shared, unspoken understanding that we are all participating in the same beautiful, meaningless joke.

So go on. Bookmark that new place in Tomigaya. Queue for 40 minutes for the bagel place in Koenji. Spend fifteen minutes photograph your matcha affogato. Knot your head with the best of them.

Embrace your inner pompous wanker. The coffee is fantastic, and the company‚Äîin all its silent, judgy, glorious pretense‚Äîis even better.

Yours in caffeinated contradiction,

A Fellow Knot-Head

Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras‚Äînone of that was ever her. She‚Äôs the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She‚Äôs known him longer than the world has‚Äîbefore the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday‚Äîa regular Tuesday for him. She doesn‚Äôt expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn‚Äôt say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests,¬†*‚ÄúMaybe when you‚Äôre done at the studio‚Ä¶ we could just do something. Anything, really.‚Äù*¬†But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn‚Äôt cry‚Äînot at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly‚Äîa new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he‚Äôll even notice when she‚Äôs gone. Because she‚Äôs not angry‚Äîjust tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**  
I‚Äôm searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer‚Äîwhatever feels right. The key is that he‚Äôs lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he‚Äôs hurting the only person who‚Äôs never wanted anything from him but love.

1o9htsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o9htsv/old_bait/,Old Bait,"The box was full of tiny, shriveled, decaying bodies. Blank, lifeless eyes staring into space. Skin, split and dried, revealing a dark, gooey surface beneath. Some of them still had all their limbs, if they were the lucky ones. Should I have expected anything more from my old box of fishing bait?

If I wasn‚Äôt running so late, I would have had time to buy some proper lures. But if I hadn‚Äôt stayed for ‚Äújust one more cup of coffee‚Äù with my parents, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to my storage unit late, and maybe, if I just left on time to begin with, I wouldn‚Äôt be late for my best friend's bachelor party.

I hadn‚Äôt been back home in years, and for me, that home is a little town in the middle of nowhere, Northeast USA. It's one of those towns that time seems to have missed its march across the world. The air, the scenery, the buildings, they all reminded me of life here as a kid. Even looking at my tacklebox, covered in Ben 10 stickers I bought with money from mowing lawns. There was that scratch it got when it fell off the dock the night my friends and I bought a pack of Monsters and went fishing.

And there, on the lid, was one of those plastic, glow-in-the-dark stars everyone used to have on their ceilings. I laughed looking at it, remembering how I‚Äôd stolen from my friend Nick‚Äôs bedroom and hid it from my parents until I thought the coast was clear. Looking back, they may have let me off, knowing the kind of guy Nick turned out to be. It was stupid, but I stole it because it reminded me of the earrings that woman was wearing on that billboard.

That billboard. The memory crept into my mind, or better yet, heaved itself up from the depths of the past.

It sat on Route 161 on the way into town. ‚ÄúWHO KILLED ME?‚Äù was written across it, in bold yellow letters, followed by a name and a number still lost in the deep. But what I did remember was her face. Her photo must have been from the late 80‚Äôs, if I were to guess. She was young, mid-20s, around my age now. Her face was kind, framed in bleach blonde hair done up in a ponytail and laid over her shoulder. And hanging clearly from her ear was a gaudy plastic earring in the shape of a star, not unlike the one on my tacklebox.

I was too young to really grasp the idea of murder as a kid. I remember whenever we would pass that stretch of road, I would always look at the woodline, hoping to see her alive and well, just lost. I remember asking my poor parents if the poster was wrong. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what they said, but it wasn‚Äôt the answer I wanted to hear.

The memory of it cast a shadow as I loaded the kit into my truck. I could only assume whoever paid for that poster never found their answer. A few years later, someone covered her over with some new advertising. ‚ÄúWhat are YOU waiting for?‚Äù it said. Probably an ad for real estate or boat sales‚Ä¶

A ping from our group chat pulled me back to the present, back to why I was here, for my friend, and to celebrate. It was the man of the hour himself, asking where I was, saying I was one of the last to show. I texted back that I was on my way, before turning over the engine, and pulling out of the parking lot.

The sky was painted in one of those orange and purple sunsets, leaves swirled in the air behind my truck and I took off down the road. It was a backroads kind of evening, and just my luck, the backroads would take me where I needed to go. I turned off the main paved drive onto old Bog Road, which dipped down to the flatlands of the valley, and came out by where we‚Äôd be staying.

The further I drove, the more the darkness of twilight filled the valley like a rising, murky tide. I turned on my headlights, which beamed out into the growing night. The air cooled; the woods deepened. It was an offness. Like waking up as a kid and finding your nightlight off, or as an adult, falling asleep by a woodfire, and waking up in the dark. I rolled up my windows.

As the sun gave way to moonlight, an unease I had of night driving set in. I began looking out for deer, or anything else that might step out from the woodline. When I rounded a turn, the bright red flash of a silver BMW‚Äôs reflectors grabbed my focus. It was pulled over to the side of the road, lights still on, driver‚Äôs side door open. For the moment, I assumed someone stopped to take a leak, though, he‚Äôd have to be desperate to do that here.

Murky wetlands bordered both sides of the road, and the forest opened into a great bog, dotted with clusters of trees and debris, muddy, brown, and ripe in the decay of autumn. The water was flat as glass, reflecting the moon in near perfection, barely disturbed by some movement.

I tried to make out what it was. It didn‚Äôt dash like a fish, but it was too glossy to be any sort of log. I took my eyes from the road, just for a second.

A flash of color emerged into my headlights. I swerved, slamming my brakes and skidding down the road. I didn‚Äôt think I hit something, but I gripped the steering wheel white-knuckled, and turned on my hazards.

Behind me, about twenty feet back was a person. I could just make her out as the lights flashed.

I got out, stumbling over my words in apologies. But she just waved her arms dismissively, staggering in place.

Drunk, clearly. The BMW suddenly made sense, rich tourists loved getting on benders at the lake houses down here, them and druggies alike. I was equal parts pissed and sympathetic.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúLook, just- stay where you are, I don‚Äôt want you falling in. Is there someone I can call to pick you up?‚Äù

She began to stumble her way towards me, getting closer with each hazard blink.

‚ÄúI can give you a lift, you‚Äôre in no state to drive.‚Äù

She said nothing, but came closer. At this point, I leaned back into my car. Whoever this was, she was drunk at best, and at worst, had someone waiting in the woodline to jump me. I‚Äôd have to be late, the cops could deal with this, but I‚Äôd wait to make sure she didn‚Äôt fall in.

Looking back to her, she‚Äôd stopped. Stooped down where the water ran beneath the road in a culvert, fiddling with some rope that went off into the bog, tugging on it and wrapping it around her wrist, when in-between blinks, she was gone. Right after, I heard a splash, and the sound of limbs smacking against water.

‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I shouted, running down to where she fell in.

I could make her out in the moonlight as my eyes adjusted. The ripples and waves in the water rising like silver threads. One foot sinking into the muck, I reached down, ready to grab her, when I stopped. Something turned in my gut. Above the splashing, the forest, the bog, everything was silent. The hairs on the back of my neck stood like pins, and I froze.

When I stopped, she stopped. Total silence fell over the bog, and she floated still, face down.

Then, it started again, but with a single twist of her arm, which snapped backwards on the elbow. Her skin rippled, something squirming beneath, when her knees buckled back on themselves ‚Äì even her spine writhed like a worm beneath her skin. The water splashed in a great line, all the way out to the bog‚Äôs center, where I could just catch for a second, something dark, wrinkled like a great, bloated leech that heaved itself up from the deep.

My adrenaline spiked, going pale as a ghost, I ran back to my truck. Behind me I heard the water splash, something soaked flopped onto the dirt road, scrambling and kicking up dirt and rocks. I jumped in my truck, slamming the heavy steel door, less than a second before something crashed against the window.

In the fading warm glow of the cabin light, I made out her hand, sinewy and pale, sliding up towards the top of the glass. Her face emerged from the dark, blank glossy eyes that stared into space, skin dried and split, housing writhing white maggots in its damp pockets. And from the ear she was lucky enough to still have, hung an earring, cracked and sunfaded, but unmistakably, in the shape of a star.

I nearly punched a hole in the floor beneath the gas pedal, barreling down the road. As she was pulled away, I could hear scraping on glass, ending with the abrupt sound of dry \*SNAP\*.

I got to the cabin a few minutes later, feeling relief as that automatic floodlight filled my cabin with a warm, halogen glow. My heart was still racing. I gathered myself. I could‚Äôve called the cops, but I know this town, I know our police officer. Whatever was out there, if he went to investigate, he‚Äôd go alone‚Ä¶ No, I couldn‚Äôt risk that, risk whatever that was taking advantage of someone trying to help. And if I told my friends, same story. Nobody travels that road, not unless they‚Äôre coming here, and at this point, I was the last to arrive. I kept it to myself, just for now.

Swallowing down all of what happened, we made it a night to remember. Though all the while, I watched the windows. Every time that light tripped on, I‚Äôd step to the window, looking out into the dark.

Come morning, my friend and I shot out early for a trip into town to grab some doughnuts and coffee for the guys, and thankfully for me, some new fishing lures.

‚ÄúSorry about being late last night.‚Äù I said, looking out the window into the woodline as I drove.

‚ÄúSeriously man, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù He replied. ‚ÄúLeast you‚Äôre not Nick.‚Äù

‚ÄúNick? He was coming?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ Well, he wasn‚Äôt planning to. Not until he messaged me and said he had a new toy to show off, fancy silver BMW apparently. My bet was drug money. Never showed though, bailed last minute.‚Äù

I said nothing, but stopped where our road met the one that led into town. There, sunken into the woodline sat the remains of that billboard. Big chunks of the new ad had peeled away, showing what had been buried for years. Now a Frankenstein mix of old and new, the moss-covered billboard read: ‚ÄúWHAT. killed me?‚Äù

I heard my friend open up my tacklebox.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?! Good thing we‚Äôre getting you some new lures‚Äù he said, holding one up to inspect it. ‚ÄúUnless we‚Äôre going for the dumbest fish in the bog, you‚Äôre not going to catch anything using old bait.‚Äù",1,1760747387.0,creepcast,0,0.67,False

I (F27, Brazilian) have been single for a year after a 5-year relationship, still relearning how to date.

We had such nice dates, but eventually he said his last relationship ended because his ex wanted kids and he didn‚Äôt, so dating younger felt ‚Äúless pressure.‚Äù I told him I wasn‚Äôt rushing into a relationship.

I got anxious like why shut the door like this‚Ä¶ I messaged on Instagram asking if I did something wrong. He said he blocked me so he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt reach out again if he got emotional,‚Äù because I ‚Äúdeserve closure.‚Äù

I have a 1tb steam deck OLED (and a 1tb sd card) that I've been using for a few months now (best device ever). I have about 80gb worth of stuff in compdata. The goal is to swap it out for a 2tb but I don't know where all this space is going to and want to clean it out and organize it all before I continue.

I found online that I could use protontricks to identify the folders (if .exe ran at least once) however.. the other day, I was trying to figure out how SRM worked and somehow pressed a button in settings that deleted all of my non-steam games including non-steam game launchers. If I were to add back the .exe and run it again, would it give me a completely new folder in compdata or would it use the previous one? If it uses the previous one then that would be so easy for me.

Another question is.. is there a more effective way of finding specific .exe? I wanted to play Mabinogi on my deck, but for some reason the steam version of Mabinogi isn't linux friendly so I had to download the actual Nexon launcher online, download Mabinogi on that launcher, and add it via non-steam game for it to finally run. Well.. since pressing that button that deleted everything BUT my legit steam games (SRM), I can't find where I put that launcher. And since I can't..launch it and find the folder via protrontricks, I tried searching for the actual file ""nexon\_launcher.exe"" but the search function would just rev it's fan and stay on ""searching..."" it's been like this for about 4 hours now to no avail.

Another question is.. what is the difference between .local/share/Steam/steamapps/compdata and home/.steam/steam/steamapps/compdata? I read in another thread that .local is supposed to be nonsteam data however they are both the same size and folder count. If I delete one, would the other disappear?

And is there an effective way of.. keeping everything organized for future use? I found in one of the threads that you could specifically tag compdata folders to keep it organized but is that the best way? How do you guys keep your data and folders all organized?

It's just frustrating because I don't know what's eating all of my space. I thought compdata would be the culprit. My ""games"" folder for non-steam games on main system is 175GB, steam games on main system is 352GB. Where is the rest of the space? As I'm typing this, I'm also noticing that I have more common folders. One is italicized and it's in the common folder. If I press the italicized common folder, i'll see ANOTHER italicized common folder. It's like an endless repeat and I'm so confused by it. When I right click to see that common folder to see how much space it uses, it tells me 4.0 KiB, but if I right click on the actual game folders in all of these different common folders it tells me the actual game size. Is this normal? Regardless, the total size of the FIRST common folder is 352 GB.

I would really appreciate any help on this because I am all question marks over here. And if it's too congested, I can rewrite my questions as well.

1o9hign,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1o9hign/i_need_help/,I need help,"Hey everyone,

Quick disclaimer I suffer with really bad health anxiety. This usually means my symptoms to me may seem worse than what they are because I overthink them!!!

Recently in the last maybe 7 weeks I have been noticing a more frequent urge to urinate, I have suffered with really bad anxiety for years and I haven‚Äôt in that time been out much until recently I got a job and started getting my life together, due to this I had not really had a proper girlfriend (who I actually saw, just online flings) so I resorted to very frequent masturbation. Im a 20 YO nearly 21 YO male and must‚Äôve masturbated every day (rarely skipping at all) since I was about 14. I know this may sound excessive but every man needs his release and I struggle with the urge massively.

Now within the last 7-10 weeks I have been constantly noticing my urge to urinate, the urges are sometimes sudden but sometimes not, I can hold my wee for a long time (I don‚Äôt necessarily HAVE to go in that moment) it‚Äôs the amount of times I am going which worry me, even when I have been I still feel sometimes I need to go, this worsens when I am sat down opposed to being stood up, I do a sit down office job and must go to the toilet every hour or so there, same when I am home.

My routine is not great; I wake up at 1-2pm for context and usually sleep at 5-7am most days.I usually as a result masturbate quite late on a night (early hours of the morning typically between 3-4) and will usually pee 1-2 times after before I sleep. This is where I am getting worried- it does not necessarily wake me up, but when I wake up I instantly need the toilet (for reference I do drink a lot of fluids, absolutely no caffeine, very minimal alcohol) I usually drink fizzy drinks, decaffeinated coffee and water.

I do not experience any pain at all. No burning when urinating or ejaculating and most importantly 0 blood.

I have recently got a new bed too maybe within the last 4 months that may be impacting it but I am not sure.


Again everything is painless, my urine flow differs because sometimes I am busting so it flies out others its just a dribble, its just the frequency of the urine that I am perhaps worried about.

9/10 times I am usually sat down too and because of my anxiety, I have not really been active in the last few years, I am not necessarily overweight, but I could do with losing some weight and doing a bit more with myself however I am not sure if this is a factor.

Now as I mentioned I have health anxiety and would hate to go to the doctors about this and it makes me feel sick even bearing the thought of going so I seek advice here.


Do you reckon I need to take a break from masturbating and that may be a factor as to why this is all happening? Could my prostate perhaps be inflamed (because of frequent masturbation), could it be kidney related? I am so so unsure and scared.

Please help me reddit community.

I‚Äôm visiting your awesome city this weekend from New York with my girlfriend and another couple. We‚Äôre staying in Old Montreal from Friday to Sunday, and trying to make the most of our time here.

We realized the Canadiens are playing the Rangers on Saturday night, so we‚Äôre planning to catch the game ‚Äì but also looking for any and all tips from locals on things to do, places to eat/drink, and how to get around.

A few specific questions if anyone‚Äôs willing to help:

1. Bell Centre game ‚Äì tips for tickets + getting there?

We don‚Äôt have tickets yet ‚Äì is it better to buy now or wait closer to puck drop? And since we‚Äôre staying in Old Montreal, what‚Äôs the best way to get to the Bell Centre? Uber, metro, or even walking? Is parking a bad idea?

2. Pregame/postgame spots near the arena

Any favorite local bars or places to grab a bite near the Bell Centre before or after the game? Would love something with a good vibe that‚Äôs not too touristy.

3. Dinner reservation timing

We have a dinner reservation at 9:30 PM after the game ‚Äì is that enough time to make it, or should we try to push it later just in case?

4. Other recommendations?

We‚Äôre hoping to explore a bit while we‚Äôre here. Any must-see neighborhoods, coffee shops, bakeries, breweries, or local gems you‚Äôd recommend? Bonus points for anything near Old Montreal, but we‚Äôre open to venturing out.

Huge thanks in advance! Super excited to be visiting ‚Äì hoping to soak in a bit of the culture, eat well, and maybe experience a proper Montreal night out. Appreciate any suggestions you can share!

My project management tool went down for 6 hours. No warning, no access to my data, and I had a client deadline that day.

I couldn't even see which tasks were due. Everything was locked behind a login screen with a ""We're experiencing technical difficulties"" message.

This got me thinking about how dependent I've become on cloud services that can disappear at any moment. Not just outages‚Äîwhat about:

* Subscription price increases (looking at you, every SaaS ever)
* Features getting paywalled that used to be free
* Company gets acquired and shuts down the product
* They change their terms and now own your data
* Privacy concerns with sensitive client information
* Working in places with poor internet (airplanes, coffee shops, rural areas)

**The local-first approach:**

I'm shifting to software that stores data on my computer first, with optional cloud sync. Benefits I've noticed:

1. **It just works offline** \- No internet? No problem. Your tools keep running.
2. **Your data stays yours** \- Not sitting on someone else's server being analyzed or potentially breached.
3. **No surprise bills** \- Buy once or pay a fair price without constant increases.
4. **Performance** \- Local apps are often faster since they're not waiting for server responses.
5. **Privacy for client work** \- When you're handling sensitive client data, local storage is more secure.

**What I'm NOT saying:**

I'm not anti-cloud. Cloud backup is great. Syncing across devices is convenient. But the software shouldn't *require* the cloud to function. It should be cloud-optional, not cloud-dependent.

**The mental shift:**

We've been conditioned to think ""cloud = modern and good"" and ""desktop = outdated and bad."" But local-first doesn't mean going back to 2005. Modern local-first apps can sync, collaborate, and integrate‚Äîthey just don't hold your data hostage.

For freelancers and small business owners especially, ask yourself: Can you afford for your critical business tools to be down when a company's server has issues?

Anyone else rethinking their tool stack? What's your experience with cloud outages affecting your work?

It‚Äôs your smile.,"Not even kidding, after actually talking to a bunch of girls lately, I realized the first thing they notice isn‚Äôt your height, your shoes, or your jawline. It‚Äôs your teeth. The second you smile, they decide if you‚Äôre confident or not.

I used to be super self-conscious about mine. Years of coffee, Zyns, and zero whitening game. I grabbed a whitening kit off Amazon (pretty sure it was called Gnaw Labs?) and within a week I noticed a difference. Nothing crazy, just enough that I started smiling more without overthinking it.

Confidence isn‚Äôt all mindset. Sometimes it‚Äôs fixing the small stuff that makes you feel more like the guy you want to be.

Do you think people actually notice smiles that much, or am I just overanalyzing it?",0,1760746084.0,bodylanguage,7,0.29,False

He then called me into my office & i apologized for taking a long break, which I understand is my wrong. But then he said I didnt do patient care like bathing and changing my patients.

Hey guys, so I am a first year student in IITM, BS in electronics.

I had good marks in JEE, but chose BS 'cause wanted more freedom and wanted to work in the startup world, and as AI is progressing I was sure this won't backfire on me.

So I refer to myself as a generalist,  
I have worked in partnerships, to outreach to operations, to blog writing to podcasts, to scripting, etc etc.

WiIll soon be leaving these roles and will most probably join in a coffee brand ig, I love coffee, that's why.

One of those rare, perfectly cinematic places with old brick walls, clattering boards, and benches that creaked with every movement. She sat two seats away, sipping from a paper cup like it was a ritual.

I was on my way to a job interview in a city I didn‚Äôt want to live in. She was on her way back home from a weekend visiting a friend. We both hated waiting.

She noticed me first. Or maybe I noticed her noticing me. I said something about the pigeons being the real locals here. She laughed. I swear, I‚Äôd never heard someone laugh like they meant it that early in the morning.

We talked until our trains came, hers 30 minutes before mine. Before leaving, she handed me her cup.

Here, she said. ""It‚Äôs still warm. And this way, I‚Äôll have to remember this moment every time I forget what kindness feels like.""

Who says things like that?

I took the cup. I still have it. The paper‚Äôs worn, and the name the barista scribbled is almost gone. But it‚Äôs still hers. Still warm in a weird, memory-shaped way.

We didn‚Äôt exchange numbers. Didn‚Äôt follow each other. I don‚Äôt even know her last name.

But sometimes love isn‚Äôt a long story. Sometimes it‚Äôs a single scene unfinished, but unforgettable.

Not exactly how I pictured turning twenty-three.

A TV flickered in front of me, hooked up to an ancient VCR playing‚Ä¶ Bluey?

Didn't my little cousin used to watch it?¬†

A modern cartoon fighting to survive on a thirty year old TV was enough to bring me fully back to reality. I straightened in the chair, mentally checking myself over.¬†

All limbs intact, but bound.¬†

Something snapped inside me as hysteria set in. My breaths became sharp pants, then wheezes. Stars exploded across my vision, like TV static. I tried to scream, but my lips wouldn‚Äôt part. Duct tape. 

I forced myself to focus on breathing deep through my nose, on the flickering TV, on anything but my predicament.

Bluey. 

The TV was struggling, the image fuzzy, modern colors barely bleeding through the old grainy aspect ratio. Leaning forward, I tried to watch it, but the cartoon was on mute.¬†

Every so often the screen would go black, the TV giving out, before restarting.

But why Bluey?

Movement beside me, and I realized I wasn‚Äôt alone. A figure was strapped to a chair, eyes unblinking, watching the screen.

Like swimming against a riptide, recognition came slowly. Painfully.

Popped collar, tie, lanyard. Thick, bloodstained blonde curls fell over vacant, half-lidded eyes that fixed on the TV.

I thought he was dead, until his jaw ticked under his own gag; he was trying to speak.¬†

His head lolled like a drowsy toddler, flopping forward just as the screen flashed. 

Pale blue light illuminated a coin-sized hole drilled into his skull. I could see pink fluid leaking out of it, streaming down the back of his shirt. My stomach twisted.¬†

His name caught in my throat, bile choking me as footsteps sounded from behind.¬†

A figure loomed, and white swirled in the air.¬†

I blinked.¬†

Steam?

‚ÄúDo you want some coffee, *dude*?‚Äù The voice sliced through the silence. Dark blonde curls were yanked back. 

‚ÄúNo? But I know *just* how you like it! Two sugars, one cream, and a half pump of caramel! Didn't I get your order right, *buddy*?‚Äù

That nasally squawk was unmistakable.

The figure let the boy's head flop forward, and slowly poured the scalding drink over his face. I didn‚Äôt see the cup, but my gaze jerked up when I heard the horrifying hiss of steam. He didn't move.¬†

I screamed, my body jerking, heart in my throat. But my guy didn‚Äôt even blink, thick brown coffee grounds meeting blood, culminating and seeping down his temple. 

His body swayed slightly, head inclined, eyes never leaving the TV. 

Movement to my left sent shivers sliding down my spine. Another figure. This time my cry came out raw and wrong, tearing from my scorched throat.¬†

His restraints hung loose, barely keeping him in the chair. In the flickering light, the ruined shape of his skull glimmered into view, thick red sludge trailing down his neck. 

My body reacted before my brain had time to process, my chest tightening, my thoughts spinning out of control. 

Was that what had happened to me? Throwing myself forward, I felt it, a sharp, tugging sensation at the back of my skull. 

My stomach heaved, vomit searing my raw throat.¬†

My eyes darted between my companions. I *knew* them.¬†

I knew who they were, of course I fucking did.

So why couldn‚Äôt I say their names?¬†

Tears pricked my eyes, relief sliding down my cheeks. 

Why did their names sit like rot on my tongue, like alphabet soup, tangled, wrong and shapeless? Names that felt foreign, names that didn‚Äôt feel like names at all. 

Why were my thoughts weightless?¬†

Hollow?¬†

Numb?¬†

Like every memory, every splinter of them clinging on to me was being drained.¬†

I tried to speak, to let their names roll off my tongue, but they jammed in my throat.

The second figure‚Äôs head tilted, eyes fixed on the screen. His mouth wasn‚Äôt gagged, just stretched into a wide, childlike grin.¬†

Something glowed behind us.

Three pulsing green lights.¬†

A computer? I tried to twist around, but part of me didn‚Äôt want to know. 

Wires lay tangled at my feet, snaking across the floor. The faint hum of something crawled into the back of my skull. What was it?

‚ÄúSee, Violet?‚Äù A voice boomed through the silence as a figure stepped in front of the TV.

The two figures didn‚Äôt move, though they did make small noises of protest.¬†

I thought they were waking up. Hope ignited.¬†

Stupid hope.¬†

Naive fucking hope.¬†

But then I noticed the guy to my left craning his neck, trying to see the TV screen, and the realization hit me. 

The man was blocking Bluey. His face was mostly swallowed by shadow, but that smug grin cut through the darkness. 

He knelt before me, reaching out hesitantly at first, fingers brushing across my cheeks to wipe away my tears. Then he gestured toward the others, lips curling into a knowing smirk.¬†

‚ÄúI hate to say I told you so, but I did tell you those two weren‚Äôt interested.‚Äù

To prove it, he shuffled away from the TV, and the two men stopped jerking against the ropes that pinned them down, their sharp squawks bleeding into muffled moans. Their names. I had to know them.¬†

I knew splinters. Digging deep down, I tried to hold onto what was being torn away. I knew cooked meals, Mario Kart parties, and drinks clinking together.¬†

I knew warm, sheepish smiles, thick blonde and mouse-brown hair. I knew panic attacks in the back of a car, soft brown curls between my knees. 

I knew fast-food drive-thrus at 3am. Shameless sex overlooking city lights, laptop screens, bustling cafeterias. Fights. 

Laughter.

Crying. 

Screams. Parties. 

Birthday candles. 

Sex we wanted to label too fast.¬†

Sex we didn‚Äôt want to label at all.¬†

I knew their warmth, their heavy breaths against my lips. I knew their pain. Their panic. Their fear. Twin smiles dripping with irony and warmth. The three of us against the world with our stupid fucking game.

Sharp, agonizing pain erupted behind my eyes, my body jerking, my nerve endings burning, my wrists straining against the tape. Blood trickled from my nose, slicking my lips.¬† 

And then, momentary clarity: an office, a coffee machine, hands entangled with mine. They were warm, safe. Home.

But clarity tasted like blood.¬†

Clarity twisted my gut.¬†

Clarity was too bright, too empty, a cavernous hole growing smaller and smaller.¬†

‚ÄúViolet.‚Äù

His voice snapped me back to pale light flickering in gleaming eyes.¬†

His fingers traced the back of my skull. ‚ÄúPay attention.‚Äù

A screech tore from my throat when that warmth, that comfort, that feeling of home was ripped from me. He was taking them away. Laughter collapsed into echoes.¬†

Voices bled into noise. My head jerked back, leaving only an empty memory, two shadows, and a brittle, ice-cold chill running through me. 

The memories were being violently yanked away, piece by piece, leaving behind two nameless, faceless shells staring back. 

One helpless thought lingered, and I clung on, savoring it. I loved them. That was all I knew.¬†

I blinked rapidly, fighting the grueling drain pulling them away. It wasn‚Äôt until I swallowed my denial that reality hit. 

He was going to take all of them, physically carving their brains from their skulls and mentally cherry-picking them from my mind. 

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù he laughed, snapping my focus back to him. He gripped my chin, jerking my face toward his. Leaning close, his breath tickled my skin. I knew who he was. 

I knew his name. That was the worst part. I knew everything about this asshole.¬†

While they, the ones who mattered, the ones I fucking loved, the ones I couldn‚Äôt fucking remember, were bleeding away with every pulsing blink of that green light.¬†

Every painful jerk of the thing rooted inside my head, hollowing me out.¬†

‚ÄúWho would‚Äôve thought they‚Äôd be more interested in Bluey than you?‚Äù¬†

His smile widened and he leaned down, pressing a kiss to my lips. 

Even in the dull glow of the TV, I could see red blooming across his cheeks. 

He trembled, unsure where to place his right hand, while his left groped my breast. When he finally pulled back, his smile twisted with sick pleasure.¬†

Starving eyes raked me up and down, and another memory hit. Painful. Violent. 

Too empty to register, already being purged from my brain. ‚ÄúI guess you didn‚Äôt know them as well as you thought you did.‚Äù he sighed, took two steps back, and ripped the tape off my mouth with a single swipe.

Bathed in the cartoon‚Äôs light, shadows danced across his face; my kidnapper‚Äôs eyes darkened and his lips curved. 

He grabbed his own chair, set it in front of me, and sat. ‚ÄúYou get one question,‚Äù he said, enjoying how I flinched as he shifted his chair closer. His clinical precision and finality in his tone sent me into hysterics.¬†

I didn't realize I was wailing until he slapped me, cold, hard, stinging. I reeled back; the cry collapsed in my throat. 

He stroked my hair. ‚ÄúIt won't be long now, Violet. Almost there.‚Äù His fingers traced my lips. ‚ÄúOnce the process is complete, I will personally dismember you.‚Äù 

He gave a sheepish shrug when my whole body went still. The world tilted, wrong and distant, as if I'd fallen backward. I couldn't scream.¬†

Couldn't move.¬†

Couldn't breathe.¬†

At that moment I didn't know the date or the time.¬†

I was trapped in this room, in an oblivion where time didn't exist; and I was going to fucking die. His mouth opened, and words slid out. But they were white noise. Shapeless. 

‚ÄúI know! I don't want to cut you up either, but loose ends and all. I'm going to cut you up, liquefy you, and give you back to the earth.‚Äù He grinned.

‚ÄúWhich is fitting, given your name.‚Äù His smile twisted. ‚ÄúIt's weird.‚Äù He came close again, nose to nose with me, breath to breath. I pulled back, and he cupped my cheeks, forcing me to face him. 

‚ÄúViolets have always been my favorite plant.‚Äù The man pulled back, eyes glinting. ‚ÄúI never realized they were so fucking poisonous.‚Äù

Breathing was suddenly so hard. Was I breathing?¬†

My breaths were wrong, shuddery, barely breaths at all.¬†

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù It was all I could choke out, a helpless, pathetic sob dripping from my mouth. My memories told me I wasn‚Äôt like this. I wasn‚Äôt a fucking pushover. I didn‚Äôt give in this easily. One question, he said.

One answer.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing to them?‚Äù I chose my question carefully.

That seemed to strike a nerve.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù His expression twitched. ‚ÄúDo you know who they are?‚Äù He straightened, and I drank in the room for the first time. Cold and concrete, like a tomb. *My* tomb.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

But I wanted to.

I swallowed that bit down.

He shrugged. ‚ÄúI'm not killing them, if that's what you think,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI'm using them.‚Äù

‚ÄúUsing them?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He stepped in front of guy number one. Coffee. 

That was all he was to me: coffee, blood, and brains dripping down his temples. No identity. No recognition beyond a hollow stranger whose name was rotting on my tongue.¬†

But somewhere deep down, trying to reach him, his memory smelled of coffee.¬†

Rich roasted coffee beans and fresh cupcakes.¬†

I watched my kidnapper prod the man‚Äôs face. Nothing.¬†

No spark, no light behind his eyes. ‚ÄúIt probably looks a little scary from your point of view, Violet,‚Äù he said, voice calm. Patronizing.¬†

He sighed, loud and exaggerated.¬†

I tried again. ‚ÄúThose lights,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat are they?‚Äù

His head jerked, almost like he'd been waiting for that question.¬†

‚ÄúThey're *you*! Rather, they *will* be,‚Äù he corrected. ‚ÄúRight now, only two downloads are in progress.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù I whispered. This was madness.¬†

Insanity.

‚ÄúOfficially?‚Äù Twisting around, he shot me a grin. ‚ÄúI could give you a more precise explanation, but it‚Äôs way too advanced for a mind of *your* calibre. Let‚Äôs stick with a simple playground analogy.‚Äù 

He ran his fingers through Coffee‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the process of extracting organic consciousness from a living human source via brainwaves is a little too complicated for you to understand. Think of the brain as a road and neurons are the cars. It can‚Äôt function until traffic clears, and right now there‚Äôs a fifteen thousand car pile-up.‚Äù

He turned to me, adjusting his glasses on the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúTheir bodies are currently unresponsive; a typical trauma response to cranial penetration. 

""Right now, Violet, I‚Äôm extracting their neural patterns, mapping their synapses, every thought and every memory. Their cognitive architecture is being replicated, byte by byte, while they‚Ä¶‚Äù He snapped his fingers in front of their unblinking eyes. 

‚ÄúI guess you could say they‚Äôre napping.‚Äù

I swallowed bile. ‚ÄúThey're dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh Violet, don't be brainless.‚Äù

He wrenched Coffee‚Äôs head back as a sick demonstration. The man‚Äôs lips parted, a hollow groan escaping him. ‚Äú...uhhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù

He let go. ‚ÄúI told you,‚Äù my kidnapper said, and Coffee‚Äôs head fell limp, rolling onto his shoulder, drool pooling at the corner of his mouth. ‚ÄúThey never wanted to fuck you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't know them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah,‚Äù his tone darkened. ‚ÄúThey brainwashed you to stop liking me, Violet.‚Äù

My restraints were two strips of duct tape pinning my hands down. Keeping him talking would distract him. I started working on my left wrist. 

‚ÄúSo, what exactly is the plan here?‚Äù I asked, keeping my voice steady, twisting my wrist against the chafing tape. ‚ÄúYou do realize that‚Äôs pseudoscience, right? There‚Äôs no way to copy a living consciousness onto a hard drive,‚Äù I gritted out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs science fiction.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù he said, his back still turned. I timed his movements with my own breaths, waiting for him to fully turn away before pulling my other wrist free and leaping to my feet. 

I tore my ankles loose and bounded forward blindly. But something held me, something wrenched me *back*.¬†

No!¬†

My trembling fingers traced the back of my head, where a gaping hole had been carved into my skull. No. I pulled again, but whatever held me was merciless. 

Cruel. It had dug all the way inside me, hollowing me out. My fingertips grazed bone, raw and slick. No. No. No. I couldn‚Äôt die like this. I wouldn‚Äôt die like this.¬†

I wrenched forward. This was what had taken them away from me. Another tug sent a wave of electroshocks through me.¬†

I had to get it out.

A ragged scream ripped from my throat as I plunged my fingers into the hollow where my skull should‚Äôve been, clawing for the foreign thing buried inside. 

My knees buckled. White-hot pain cracked through me. 

The world spun, blinding and wrong, and unreal. I felt myself fall, felt my body hit the floor, felt my head crack against concrete. A face flashed. Just a face. Just a smile. Warm brown eyes. Freckles.

My mouth parted. Agony exploded, contorting my limbs. Memories flared, sharper now, as the cruel edge of the object cut deeper, slicing right through me.

Brighter. Closer.¬†

The deeper memories.¬†

The ones he hadn't found yet.

Late-night talks.¬†

Locked doors.¬†

Closed curtains.

Lips meeting mine.¬†

Laughter.¬†

Distant, but as my mind collapsed, it felt closer.¬†

Voices.¬†

*‚ÄúDo you trust me, Violet?‚Äù*

Water. Blue, sparkling water.¬†

Kicking legs. Splashing.

Faces that were less shadowy, their features beginning to bleed through‚Äî

‚ÄúViolet!‚Äù

His voice snapped me out of it.

I was lying in warm red, my eyes flickering, blood spilling from my mouth.

I wanted to go back.

Back to warm water beneath a blistering sun.¬†

Back to laughter that suddenly felt familiar.¬†

Back to names on my tongue, exploding, vivid, real.

‚ÄúViolet, what did you do?!‚Äù

I blinked. Reality was cold concrete. Waiting to die. Waiting for my brains to leak out of my ears. He towered over me, expression unreadable. Slowly, he knelt.

‚ÄúOh, Violet,‚Äù he whispered, his shaking hands slick with wet warmth. He gently patted my head. ‚ÄúLook what you‚Äôve done.‚Äù

His voice trembled somewhere deep in my mind as the world tilted. 

I felt him lift my head into his lap, his fingers stroking my hair. The pulsing green light drew closer, glowing brighter until it was all I could see.¬†

It expanded, shimmering, bleeding into vivid blues and greens.

Like staring at a BIOS screen.¬†

His fingers worked quickly, feeding something into my skull.

Sharp. Cruel.¬†

I couldn't move, my limbs were stuck. Paralyzed.¬†

My mouth opened, but no sound came out.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm going to fix you.‚Äù His voice collapsed into a wet, shuddering sob. 

‚ÄúI can make you permanent. So we can be together.‚Äù His lips found my ear as I fought for air, my lungs squeezing, my breaths thinning. ‚ÄúI can make it so you live forever, Violet. Isn‚Äôt that what you want?‚Äù

No.

Instead of clinging to reality, to the ice-cold, to the agony, I reached out, upward, until I was touching warmth.¬†

Warmth that glowed.¬†

Warmth that smelled like coffee.

Warmth that‚Äî

‚Ä¶

Being a game developer was never something I planned. It just kind of happened.

I was in college studying Game Design, Interactive Narratives, and Game Development.¬†¬†

I was offered a job at an indie game studio right after college, joining as a writer. On my first day, I expected to stroll in and immediately start writing masterpieces.

I wasn‚Äôt prepared for a room full of gawky, just-out-of-college guys with dark circles under their eyes and zero social skills. The office had a hierarchy, just like high school:¬†

Game devs in the furthest corner ignoring everyone, narrative writers huddled near the coffee machine, and script writers clustered around the table. 

My official job was narrative writing. The other writers were cliquey, already established friends in their early-thirties, with judgmental eyes and Harry Potter stickers plastered on their laptops. 

They lamented over BTS fanfiction and, I was pretty sure, definitely talked shit about me behind my back.

Then there was a middle-aged motherly type of woman, with rainbow pigtails who typed like a psychopath.¬†

Her idea of humor was tossing a cereal bar in my face and shooing me to my desk. Apparently, I wasn't the only newbie.¬†

Just when I thought things couldn‚Äôt get any more awkward, our team was dragged into a ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù that turned out to be an ice-breaker activity. 

We stood in a barely adequate circle and tossed a beanbag to each other while introducing ourselves.¬†

The thing about having colleagues is, nobody is there to socialize.¬†

I quickly realized this after learning everyone's names.¬†

Steffy, Annalise, and Nara were the cliquey thirty year olds on my team.

Tom and Ben were the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù devs, already with several mobile games.¬†

Greta. Fifty four with an adult daughter she mentioned only seventy-five times a day.¬†

Eli, a programmer. He smiled at me during the ice-breaker, but kept his head down.¬†

Finally, a dev who introduced himself by sheepishly plucking a ballpoint out of his pocket. 

He didn‚Äôt talk to anyone except Eli, and looked uncomfortable when I tried making small talk in the elevator.

So much for making friends.

I spent most of my time at my desk or the coffee machine. Eli came over sometimes to talk, but after catching him with his hand shoved down his pants under his desk, I kept my distance. 

The problem was, Eli didn‚Äôt seem to get the hint. He asked me out when we went for coffee, and I said, ‚ÄúI've actually got plans tonight.‚Äù

Eli nodded and smiled, and asked me the exact same thing the following morning, running into me as I climbed out of my car. 

I said no. Again. Steffy, one of the girls, noticed him cornering me in the empty office at lunch, and didn‚Äôt say a word.

Work became suffocating. Eli was there every morning, two inches from my face, asking me to dinner.¬†

When I finished my work at the end of the day, he waited until I started to log off.¬†

Then he would log off, too. ‚ÄúWow, what a coincidence, Violet!‚Äù he said, brushing past me on his way out. Behind us, Nara and Tom were huddled over a project. ‚ÄúI'll walk you to the parking lot!‚Äù¬†

Eli reached for me, his trembling hand trying to wrap around my wrist.¬†

Tom glanced up, noticed Eli‚Äôs grip, then smiled faintly, and looked away.¬†

Nobody fucking cared.

Or they did, they just didn‚Äôt want to care.

Eli started leaving me gifts on my desk: teddies, candy, candles.

When I moved desks, so did he, tripping over himself to carry his stuff to the one next to me. I started leaving early, and then so did he, pretending to be ill.

‚ÄúViolet,‚Äù he‚Äôd lean over me while I typed, boiling breath tickling the back of my neck. ‚ÄúDo you want to hang out tonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, my throat on fire. ‚ÄúI have‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow?‚Äù he said, leaning closer. ‚ÄúWhat about Saturday?‚Äù


‚ÄúI have plans.‚Äù

Eli didn‚Äôt budge when I tried to sidestep him. Instead, he leaned in, his voice dropping low. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been around long enough to notice my colleagues‚Äô quirks,‚Äù he murmured. 

‚ÄúTom bites his thumb when he‚Äôs nervous. Nara zones out whenever Greta talks. And Penn‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs basically an iPad baby if you leave him alone in a room.‚Äù Closer.¬† His breath brushed my ear. 

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help noticing, did you know you clench your fists when you‚Äôre lying?‚Äù

He lingered, as if enjoying the shiver down my spine, then turned and walked away.

After a while, I realized why Eli‚Äôs behavior was being ignored.

‚ÄúOh, Eli?‚Äù 

Nara nearly choked on her coffee when I mentioned his name. Nara was one of those girls who was like ‚ÄòFINE, I'll sit with you‚Äô when her clique was missing. She leaned across the table during lunch, her usual playful expression darkened. 

‚ÄúHis dad owns this place. Don‚Äôt ever fuck with Eli.‚Äù

Nara laughed, and I tried to swallow the coffee creeping back up my throat.

One year into my job, I was on the verge of quitting. Work had become torture. 

But it was my job. My money. My life. Eli made me feel small, like it was only the two of us in the room, and I was trapped. Paralyzed.

I stopped wearing dresses after he kept brushing past me, pressing against me.¬†

I stopped tying my hair up when he tugged my ponytail, like it was playful. By the time I was at my year marker, I was mentally exhausted. Always scared. I¬† couldn't¬† concentrate on my work. I clocked in, already suffocated by his dancing shadow.¬†

‚ÄúHey, Violet,‚Äù Eli said. He pulled out his ID card and clocked in with a swift swipe and a sugary grin. ‚ÄúYou look beautiful today.‚Äù

I kept my gaze ahead, ignoring him, and pushed through the doors into the studio, making a beeline for the coffee machine.¬†

Flowers were already arranged in front of my desk in perfect formation. Violets.¬†

I grabbed a cup, my hands trembling, added coffee, knocking milk everywhere. Shit.¬†

I reached for a cloth, my face burning, my heart in my throat, my stomach twisting. Tears ran down my cheeks, and I swiped them away. The thought was already choking my mind, sitting on my tongue:

I can't do this.¬†

I swiped at seeping milk, my throat tight. I can't do this anymore.

‚ÄúCan you hurry up?‚Äù

One of the devs loomed over my shoulder, hands shoved into his pockets. 

The kid who introduced himself with a ballpoint pen. 

Thick brown hair and freckles, his lanyard neatly tucked between his tie and button-down. 

The guy avoided everyone and sat in his own corner. In meetings, he looked like he was dozing off, head bowed and nodding, but clearly mentally somewhere else, probably Jupiter.

Whenever I glanced at him on workdays, he was bent over his computer, chin on his fist, fingers tapping furiously at his mouse, eyes glued to his computer. 

I thought he was working until one day, when I passed him on the way to the copy machine and he let out a guttural cry, slamming his head onto his desk.

He was playing Jump King.¬†

Presently, the guy was frowning at me like a kicked puppy. ‚ÄúMove.‚Äù The developer shooed me aside and set down a cup. 

The coffee maker hummed softly, and my chest ached. I could already sense Eli waiting to pounce, waiting for the perfect moment to run his hands down my back and claim he did it with everyone. 

I stepped back, bracing myself to return to my desk, to Eli, to pretend once again that I loved his gifts. So thoughtful. So sweet.¬†

*Wow, Eli, these are amazing, but I really can‚Äôt hang out.* The words dripped from my tongue like bile.

Maybe I'd fucking hang myself at lunch.¬†

I wasn‚Äôt expecting the dev to whirl around, handing me fresh coffee.

‚ÄúHere you go!‚Äù His smile was warm. ‚ÄúMocha. Your fave, right?‚Äù

I blinked, startled, nearly dropping it. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

He grinned, spun around, and poured himself a cup. ‚ÄúDo you trust me, Violet?‚Äù

Something surprising crept up my throat. Laughter. 

Somehow, I was smiling, and for once I wasn't masking or acting to play a role, to fit in, to satisfy ego. I was genuinely smiling. I folded my arms, playing it cool. 

I wasn't used to someone starting a conversation. Unless it was Eli, and I had to rethink every fucking word. ‚ÄúDo I trust a man who gave himself a concussion two days ago from playing a video game?‚Äù

His eyebrow quirked, confidence depleting. 

He blushed bright red, and I laughed harder. Laughing, I realized, made it so much easier to breathe. ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù He groaned, head tipping back. ‚ÄúYou saw that?‚Äù¬†

‚Äú*Everyone* saw that!‚Äù¬†

He stared down at his shoes. ‚ÄúNot my proudest moment.‚Äù His gaze flickered to me, lips curling into a smirk. ‚ÄúDo you know how to get rid of pests?‚Äù

Before I could answer, he gently took my arm and guided me toward my desk, close enough to feel intimate but not crossing any boundaries. 

The scent of his cologne teased my nose as he leaned in, lips curling into a playful smile. That‚Äôs when I saw it, a bluish bruise smack between his eyes. I had to bite my lip to suppress a childish snicker.

‚ÄúI had a great time last night, Violet,‚Äù he said, loud enough for Eli to hear. I knew his game immediately. 

‚ÄúSame time tonight?‚Äù He pulled back, winking like we were in a damn rom-com. 

I thought he was going to kiss me before his lips found my ear instead. The guy was laughing, his body electric against mine, trembling with giggles. ‚ÄúMy place.‚Äù

Play along, his eyes told me.¬†

So, I did.

‚ÄúSounds good,‚Äù I hesitated before pecking him on the cheek. ‚ÄúI'll see you tonight.‚Äù¬†

This guy definitely thought he was the main character. ‚ÄúYou betcha.‚Äù

And scene.

I didn‚Äôt even know his name. I only recognized a few of the devs, and I kept mixing them up. 

Somehow, I found myself a little starstruck. His cologne lingered in the air, phantom breath still tickling the back of my neck. 

He returned to his desk, shoulders shaking with laughter, and I sank into my seat. The violets had been quietly removed. Eli was gone, and suddenly my morning felt brighter.

I thought it was a one-off. The guy was probably just being sympathetic, and my mascara was definitely running down my face at the coffee machine.

But then he slid into the seat across from me at lunch, tray in hand. 

For a small indie company, the place was 
huge, with checkerboard windows, a swimming pool, and a cafeteria the size of a lecture hall. 

They really took care of their staff. 

I was already too aware of Eli watching me struggle to swallow my noodles when the dev joined me, immediately reaching over to snatch my cookie.

‚ÄúSo, about that date,‚Äù he said, taking a bite and spraying crumbs everywhere. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already booked us movie tickets.‚Äù The guy reached over to shake my hand. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Penn, by the way.‚Äù

I must have looked horrified, because he burst into giggles and then almost choked, slapping a hand over his mouth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kidding,‚Äù he said between laughs, shooting me a grin. I kicked him under the table.¬†

‚ÄúIdiot.‚Äù¬†

He feigned pain, then went back to demolishing his sandwich. The guy was a messy eater.

Penn rested his chin on his fist, warm brown eyes raking me up and down. ‚ÄúDo you always look like a deer caught in headlights, or is that just a today thing?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer, and he smirked, swiping mayo off his chin. ‚ÄúOh, shit. Right.‚Äù His eyes flicked toward Eli‚Äôs looming shadow behind us, his voice dropping into a dramatic hiss. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being stalked.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's driving me insane,‚Äù I whispered.¬†

‚ÄúWho, Eli?‚Äù Penn took another bite, chewing loudly. He finished the sandwich, drained his coffee. ‚ÄúOnce again. How do you get rid of pests?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBug spray?‚Äù I lost my appetite, pushing my tray away.

‚ÄúPissing them off,‚Äù Penn winked. ‚ÄúSo, from a completely fictional situationship that‚Äôs absolutely, one hundred percent platonic and totally not about fending off a freaky incel.‚Äù He waggled his eyebrows, every crease in his face alive with teasing warmth that sent my heart into my throat, my stomach fluttering. ‚ÄúWill you go out with me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚Äù

He grinned, leaning back, arms folded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a no.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill it get him off my back?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTrust me. If he knows you're in a relationship, he'll back off.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd how do you know that?‚Äù the words choked in my throat. ‚ÄúI'm the one who has to check my door every night to make sure he's not standing in my fucking kitchen.‚Äù 

It was intended as a joke, but my hands were shaking, my voice splintering into a sob.¬†

Penn‚Äôs expression darkened, and for a moment, he dropped the act.¬†

‚ÄúI had the displeasure of knowing him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEli is a psychopath. He's obsessed with me. This guy wrote stories about the two of us in high school being childhood friends. I told him to stop, but he didn‚Äôt. I tried being polite, and everyone ignored the shit he was doing. Some major fucking gaslighting.‚Äù¬†

He let out a choked laugh, his eyes somewhere else entirely. 

‚ÄúFor a while, I felt like I was losing my fucking mind. I felt trapped. He was always there, in my face, and every time I walked into that studio, it felt like a chain was wrapped around my neck.‚Äù¬†

Penn squeezed his eyes shut, exhaling out a breath. He was surprisingly vulnerable. Small, when I really looked at him. Always on guard.¬†

Always glancing over his shoulder. ‚ÄúThese stories weren‚Äôt just a crush,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey were an obsession, so I distanced myself. I shouted at him, called him a freak, and cut him loose before he could get closer.‚Äù Penn rested his head in his arms. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lonely, and that makes him dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre always on your own,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEli cast you out.‚Äù

He lifted his head, his smile lazy, strands of brown feathering his eyes. 

‚ÄúWas me eating alone and hiding in my corner that obvious? Eli‚Äôs dad runs our asses. After I told him to fuck off, I was given an ultimatum: I either sit in the bad corner or lose my job. Since I‚Äôm one of the better devs, the higher-ups decided to keep me around.‚Äù Penn shot me a look. ‚ÄúOn a leash, of course.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSo, you're me.‚Äù

He raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúBetter looking and devilishly handsome? Yep! Say hello to Eli‚Äôs first victim.‚Äù

I kicked him again.¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, grabbing my bag and jumping up. Penn followed.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù He repeated.¬†

I smiled, and my heart fluttered. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù¬†

The good news: Penn Cameron became my fake boyfriend.

The bad news: surprise, surprise, the two of us were paired with Eli for a new project. I braced myself for awkwardness. 

Surprisingly, the initial meeting went well. 
Eli spoke robotically but, to his credit, professionally, keeping his distance. We settled on a concept, and Eli disappeared to his computer to work on designs.

Penn and I played boyfriend and girlfriend convincingly enough. 

We held hands in public, stayed in close contact, his head always on my shoulder, and pretended to kiss when we thought nobody was watching. I found it far funnier than I probably should have.

Penn could not keep a straight face while pecking me on the cheek and whispering in my ear, and I was a terrible actress in general. We ended up acting like two middle schoolers.¬†

He would drag me into a closet, and we would ‚Äúhave sex‚Äù, just sitting there, shoulder to shoulder, cackling, scrolling through TikTok. Somehow, everyone bought it.¬†

Eli stopped waiting for me to finish work, because Penn never left my side.¬†

Away from Eli‚Äôs cold gaze, Penn and I hung out more freely, and he quickly became something more than a friend, definitely something more than a pretend boyfriend. 

His apartment was full of cats. This guy was a twenty-two-year-old cat lady.

At work, we came up with a concrete idea. Penn already had a name.¬†

***Neverwood***: a cozy visual novel set around a group of friends in the big city attending an arts school.

Work fell into a comfortable, predictable rhythm for a couple months.

On what was supposed to be a boring Monday, a newbie crashed into the studio.

Blonde bedhead, a wide grin, and a scarf wrapped around his neck despite the stifling June heat. 

His shirt was untucked, tie tangled around a popped collar, definitely an ex-frat boy. 

He looked maybe a year younger than us, and word quickly spread that he was a socialite, the son of a famous food chain family. So, of course he was immediately sidelined and nicknamed ‚Äúnepo baby.‚Äù

I could tell from his rolled eyes when Eli rushed over to greet him that this guy was going to be trouble. He waved and introduced himself.

‚ÄúSup. I‚Äôm Jude. Short for Jude.‚Äù

When silence met him, he grinned wider.

‚ÄúWhy so quiet?‚Äù Jude flopped into his designated seat, kicking his legs up on the desk. ‚ÄúAre you all fuckin‚Äô Mormon?‚Äù

Jude‚Äôs impression‚Ä¶ well, it was an impression.

He trudged over to our corner, where we were huddled around Eli‚Äôs computer. I was showing off the rough character designs I‚Äôd sketched overnight.

‚ÄúNice art!‚Äù Jude stood over us, teeth caught on a pen he was chewing. ‚ÄúVery *Life is Strange,*‚Äù he added, and then plopped down next to Penn. Without missing a beat, he pointed straight at Eli.

‚ÄúYou Eli?‚Äù¬†

Eli nodded. ‚ÄúUh. Yes.‚Äù¬†

Jude smirked. ‚ÄúUh yeeess,‚Äù he mocked Eli, who instantly looked on the verge of tears. Jude‚Äôs gaze shifted to me. 

‚ÄúI was sent here to work with you guys.‚Äù His eyes flicked to Penn, and his expression softened. He nodded to my computer screen. ‚ÄúSo, is this the project?‚Äù¬†

Penn and I explained the concept, showed Jude the designs, concept art, and my unfinished script. 

Eli sat silently, glaring down at his lap. During lunch, Jude joined us, slumping into the seat next to Penn. ‚ÄúSo, the selective mute,‚Äù he said, biting into his sandwich and gesturing toward Eli. ‚ÄúWhat's his deal?‚Äù

Penn choked on his coffee. ‚ÄúEverything. The dude is a freak.‚Äù¬†

Jude‚Äôs eyebrows pricked with intrigue. ‚ÄúOh?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust don't act friendly,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll get‚Ä¶ Clingy.‚Äù

My colleague took one look at Penn‚Äôs hollow eyes and downed his soda. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind.‚Äù

Jude quickly became more than just a colleague. Loud, flirtatious with everyone, and completely unfiltered, he had a brassiness that was impossible to ignore. 

His inability to read a room and his habit of blurting out whatever came to mind made him simultaneously insufferable and the best thing to happen to the studio. Jude called it ADHD.

¬†I called it being an asshole.¬†

Seven weeks in, we were closing in on our deadline, and Eli had done zero work. So we made him our coffee boy.

It was fair. I was driving myself insane writing the script, Penn was losing sleep redoing background animation, and Jude was programming. Eli was zero help. Instead, spending days working on his personal project.

We made a rule: whoever was late brought coffee.¬†

Eli was always late.¬†

Penn tried to get into Eli's computer to get something we needed (password: violets), but his files were all encrypted. The only one that wasn‚Äôt was on the desktop for anyone to see. A red herring, probably.

When we clicked it, the file was empty. But it did have a name.

‚ÄúProject Synapse.‚Äù Jude hovered over me, laughing. ‚ÄúWait. He's working on another game?‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks like it,‚Äù Penn said, glued to the screen.

Three folders:

BUILDING.

TEXTILES.

CHARACTERS.

I felt the breath leave my lungs when three names appeared.

VIOLET.

PENN.

JUDE.

‚ÄúWait, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù I prodded at the screen. ‚ÄúSomething about 2021.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo you, Love 2021,‚Äù Jude mocked in Eli‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúJeez, this guy is a fucking riot. Why use our names?‚Äù

The door flew open and Penn jumped out of Eli‚Äôs chair.

Jude didn‚Äôt seem to care. He plopped into the seat, spinning around.

‚ÄúLate again, Eli,‚Äù he said.

Penn laughed, and I couldn‚Äôt help but join in. Somehow I found myself perched on his lap with his arms wrapped around me. I wasn‚Äôt sure when the situationship had turned into a relationship.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have a Frappuccino!‚Äù Jude announced. ‚ÄúTwo pumps of espresso, no foam, and cream. Thank yaaaaa.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCoffee.‚Äù Jude grinned. ‚ÄúIt's your turn, bro.‚Äù¬†

Eli‚Äôs eyes were wild as he stumbled to his desk, shoving past me and Penn. ‚ÄúWere you on my computer?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, yeah, your password is VIOLETS,‚Äù Jude said, rolling his eyes. He stood, closing the distance between them. His grin was wide, a subtle warning not to fuck with him.¬† Jude‚Äôs voice dropped into a low murmur. ‚ÄúIf I wanted a fucking character based on me, I would have written it myself.‚Äù

With Jude now inches away, nose to nose with him, Eli froze. His eyes darted to me.¬†

I looked away.¬†

Eli was a freak. Obsessed. Someone had to hold him accountable, and Jude Carlisle was the only one who ever did. 

Jude‚Äôs smile twisted. ‚ÄúYour weird fanfic bullshit ends now. This is the real world, Eli.‚Äù He shoved him aside. ‚ÄúDelete me from that crap, or I‚Äôll have your ass arrested for stalking‚Äî‚Äù

The next few months were tedious. The game was going well, but Eli was acting more and more unhinged.

Eli was there again.

3am. The sound of rain on the window woke me. I sat up, bleary-eyed. 

The storm was comforting, already lulling me back to sleep. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚Äôs apartment was cold. He insisted it was because ‚Äúhe was prone to the heat,‚Äù but I preferred psychopath. Sleep bled into me once more, and I buried my head in pillows.

4am.

I woke to rain being blown through the window, dancing across my flushed cheeks. The air smelled damp. Wet. My eyes flew open. The third time this week. ‚Äú‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà.‚Äù I grumbled. ‚ÄúShut the fucking window.‚Äù

""Nope.""

I kicked him, and on my other side, ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà spluttered into silk sheets. ""Why not?""

""Because it's too hot,""¬† ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà mumbled.

""There's a storm!"" I hissed.

He only grunted, cuddling closer. I shoved him away.

Rolling out of bed, I shuffled to the window, slamming it shut. 

City lights blurred through raindrops; towering skyscrapers the perfect backdrop in a city that never slept. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚Äôs place dripped ‚Äúborn-with-a-silver-spoon‚Äù energy. 

My colleague‚Äôs bedroom was full of his accomplishments. Game concepts and character sketches littered the walls.

Pressing my face against the cold window pane, I stared out into the hollow night.

I was tracing a race between two raindrops with my finger when I saw him. Hiding under a hooded sweatshirt, head bowed, arms folded. Eli.¬†

He was ankle-deep, shivering, and yet still there.¬†

Still waiting. I scrambled back just as Eli turned, head tilted, his wide eyes finding mine. And in the glow of passing headlights, his lips broke out into a grin. ‚ÄúEli.‚Äù I managed to choke out, my stomach swimming.

I didn‚Äôt drive straight to the station. I went back to the hotel.

My sister opened the door before I could knock. Her face was pale, eyes sunken from another sleepless night.

‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI just needed to clear my head.‚Äù

She searched my face. ‚ÄúYou look like hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had worse shifts.‚Äù

She tried to smile, but it broke halfway through. ‚ÄúI keep thinking maybe she‚Äôll call‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLike this is all some mistake.‚Äù

I forced myself to meet her eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find her. I promise.‚Äù

She nodded, but I could tell she didn‚Äôt believe me. ‚ÄúI keep replaying that morning‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWhat I could‚Äôve done different.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll drive yourself crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one to talk.‚Äù

She was right.

I stayed until she finally laid down, exhaustion winning over fear once again. I watched her breathing even out before I slipped out again.

I parked two blocks away and sat in the car with the engine off. My phone sat in my lap like a live grenade. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to call anyone. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to do anything. But I couldn‚Äôt just wait for him to call.

If he said ‚Äúthe others‚Äù then there had to be others.

I drove to the precinct, let myself in through the side entrance, and pulled every missing person report I could find that matched my niece‚Äôs age bracket. No one was watching, the desk officer was half asleep.

I sat in the dark with the blue glow of the screen washing over me.

Names, faces, addresses. Most were runaways, custody disputes, tragic but explainable.

But a few‚Ä¶ felt wrong. Clean houses. Quiet neighborhoods. Parents who described the same eerie calm.

‚ÄúNothing seemed out of place.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt looked like she‚Äôd just gone to school.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe bed was made.‚Äù

The phrase kept repeating across different reports like background noise I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. Not enough to build a case. Just enough to itch under the skin.

One detective had even written, no signs of struggle, room unusually tidy.

Unusually tidy.

I leaned back in the chair. If I said anything, if I pointed this out, it would sound like pattern chasing. Like paranoia. But I knew what I was looking at.

He wasn‚Äôt picking victims. He was picking environments.

Perfect homes. Perfect kids.

He‚Äôd been doing this for a while, quietly, carefully. Long enough that the evidence looked like coincidence.

I copied what I could onto a flash drive and pocketed it. When I left the building, the night air hit cold and sharp. The streets were empty.

For a second I thought about going back to the hotel, but the thought of seeing my sister‚Äôs face again, of having to lie, it made my stomach twist.

So I sat in the car instead, the reports flickering in my head.

The dashboard clock read 2:43 a.m. when the phone buzzed. Blocked number.

I didn‚Äôt answer at first. I just watched it light up, once, twice, three times. On the fourth, I picked up.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre working late‚Äù Mark said.

My stomach went cold. ‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou drive like someone looking for a reason not to go home.‚Äù
He paused, almost amused. ‚ÄúDid you find them? The others?‚Äù

I said nothing.

‚ÄúI figured you might‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good officer. A practiced one. That‚Äôs what I like about you. You believe repetition makes things safe. You do something enough times, you start to think it‚Äôll protect you.‚Äù

My throat felt tight. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo teach‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúPerfection begins with practice.‚Äù

The line stayed quiet for a beat. I could hear faint movement on his end, something brushing against fabric, then the soft click of a switch.

‚ÄúYou practice every day‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRoutine. Coffee. Uniform. You think that makes you strong. But repetition is just another way of hiding fear. So tonight, we will practice something new.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not playing your game.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already are‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been playing since the day you met me. Tonight, go home. Don‚Äôt look for me. Don‚Äôt call anyone. Just keep practicing what you do best, pretending everything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

The call ended.

I sat there, staring at my reflection in the windshield. My pulse was still hammering in my ears.

Practice. The word crawled under my skin.

The phone buzzed again at 4:17 a.m. Blocked number.

I almost didn‚Äôt answer. Part of me hoped if I ignored it, it would stop. But it didn‚Äôt.

I picked up. ‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs voice came through soft, steady. ‚ÄúYou sound tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me where she is.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been asking all the wrong questions‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens when people don‚Äôt understand the lesson.‚Äù

I rubbed a hand over my face, trying to steady my breathing. ‚ÄúWhat lesson?‚Äù

He let the silence hang long enough for me to hear how calm he was.
‚ÄúPerfection takes practice‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúAnd what better place to practice than where she learned what perfect looked like?‚Äù

The words just hung there between us.

For a few seconds, I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt even understand.
She never cared about perfection, her room was always a wreck.
That was half the joke between us. I used to step over piles of clothes and tell her it looked like her closet exploded. She‚Äôd laugh and say it was creative.

But that night, when she went missing, her room had been spotless.
Too spotless.

My chest tightened.

He wasn‚Äôt talking about some memory. He was talking about now.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúMark‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs improving‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúYou should be proud. I think she finally understands what I‚Äôm trying to show her.‚Äù

The line clicked.

For a long time I just sat there, the phone still in my hand. The air inside the car felt heavier, like the oxygen had thinned.
I wanted to believe he was bluffing. That maybe he meant something else.
But the words kept replaying. Where she learned what perfect looked like.

Her room.

That perfect room.

He was there.

By the time I started the car, my hands were shaking so bad I nearly dropped the keys.

I was halfway to the house when the phone lit up. My sister.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶‚Äù

She cut me off before I could say anything. Her voice was frantic, high, trembling.
‚ÄúI just talked to her!‚Äù

I gripped the wheel tighter. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI talked to her. She called me. I swear to God she called me.‚Äù

My pulse slammed in my ears. ‚ÄúSlow down. Tell me what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was whispering‚Äù she said, her words tripping over each other. ‚ÄúI could barely hear her. I kept saying her name, and then‚Ä¶ then I heard him.‚Äù

My stomach turned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was him. The man who took her.‚Äù She was crying now, breath catching between every word. ‚ÄúHe told her to say something. Like it was a game.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWhat did she say?‚Äù

There was silence on the line except for her breathing. Then she whispered,
‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòMommy, he wants me to tell you‚Ä¶ perfection takes pain.‚Äô‚Äù

I slammed the brakes, the car jerking sideways on the empty road.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she said. And then she screamed. And then‚Äù her voice broke. ‚ÄúAnd the call just‚Ä¶ just ended.‚Äù

I pressed the phone tight to my ear, but there was nothing left. No sound.

‚ÄúStay in the room,‚Äù I said. My voice came out lower, steadier than I felt. ‚ÄúLock the door and don‚Äôt move. Do you understand me?‚Äù

She tried to speak, but I hung up before she could argue.

The road stretched out in front of me, black and endless.
My hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking, but I pressed down on the gas anyway.

Tires screeched as I pulled into the driveway.
I barely threw the car into park before I was out, gun in hand.

The front door was unlocked. I pushed it open and moved room to room. Slow, methodical, every corner cleared, every shadow checked.

The house was silent.

The only light came from the crack beneath my niece‚Äôs bedroom door. A faint, steady glow that painted a thin line across the hallway floor.

I raised my weapon and turned the handle slowly.

She was there.
Curled up on the floor beside her bed, shaking but unharmed. Her eyes found mine and she started to sob.

I holstered my gun and dropped to my knees. ‚ÄúHey, hey, it‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre safe now. I‚Äôve got you.‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt get the words out, just nods, gasps, and the sound of her breathing against my chest.

‚ÄúHe told me if I got up he would‚Äôve killed you!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay you don‚Äôt have to worry now!‚Äù

Silence filling the air as we embraced.

Then a noise broke the quiet.
Mechanical, familiar.

The printer.

It sat on the desk across the room, light blinking. A fresh sheet slid out, face down.

I stood up and walked over, my pulse hammering in my ears.

When I flipped the page over, my stomach turned to ice.

It was a photo of the hotel. My sister‚Äôs hotel room door.
Across it, in thick red letters:
PERFECTION TAKES PAIN.


I called the precinct on the way.
My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the phone steady.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI found my niece. She‚Äôs alive. I need units at the hotel we were staying at right now.‚Äù

They started asking questions I didn‚Äôt have answers for.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs there‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe went after my sister. Just get there. Please.‚Äù

My niece sat in the passenger seat beside me, small and silent.
Her hands clutched her stuffed rabbit like it was part of her. She hadn‚Äôt spoken since I found her.

The drive felt endless. Every red light looked the same color as the ink on that note.
Perfection takes pain.
Over and over until the words stopped sounding human.

When I turned into the parking lot, I saw the light from our room still on. 

I parked hard and got out, my niece right behind me.
The door was cracked open.

The smell hit before I even stepped inside.
Metal. Copper. Something heavy in the air.

I told my niece to stay close. She gripped the back of my jacket.

The bed was made.
The lamp was still on.
Everything was perfect.

I cleared the corners, the bathroom, the closet.
Nothing.

Then I saw it.

On the wall above the bed. Long, careful strokes of red.
Not splattered. Not rushed.
Written with precision.

Perfection takes pain.

My chest locked up.
I said her name once.
No answer.

My niece started crying behind me, soft and uneven.
I didn‚Äôt turn around.
I couldn‚Äôt.

There wasn‚Äôt blood everywhere.
Just enough to write.
Just enough to know she hadn‚Äôt left on her own.

I stood there for a long time, staring at that word.
The edges of each letter glistened in the light.

And that‚Äôs when I realized he wasn‚Äôt teaching her.
He was teaching me.

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says ‚Äúthrilling drama‚Äù like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who‚Äôs the real master chef.

I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, then yes, I‚Äôm basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less ‚Äúclubbing till 2am‚Äù and more ‚Äúbuilding a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.‚Äù Basically, I‚Äôm a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning, I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You‚Äôre in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use ‚Äúthere,‚Äù ‚Äútheir,‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúhey‚Äù (plot twist: you‚Äôre actually interesting). You‚Äôre the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. If you‚Äôre thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we‚Äôll get along just fine.

1o9gz4x,https://i.redd.it/2rpk4hu8gqvf1.png,"Made another concept! this time a Judge! Declan, the Overtime Justice","A former colleague of Arthur, they were one of the few people that thought they could all Arthur a friend. He tried day after day to help Arthur thinking he was just isolated and needed someone to help him... All went wrong the day Arthur showed up to work fireaxe in hand and murderous intent in mind. Declan tried to fight back, use his pistol and got one good shot it before being cleaved through the torso like butter and shot in the eye by his own gun. Now in this hell, he's taken up the offer to become a judge, filled with anger over how he's been treated, nows time to go in guns blazing...

  
Declan is a judge who passes off damage for mobility and range, always being able to keep up and pursue targets relentlessly

  
His passive is: Lightweight  
""Just try and catch me.""

Declan is far faster than most other killers and gains the ability to double jump and run on walls quickly, this allows him to navigate the map with extreme ease and catch up to survivors. But at the cost of stuns being 1.5x effective on him, so if a stun is usually 4 seconds, he's stunned for 6. and Counters DO work on his bullets

  
M1 ability is Fire  
""I""M GONNA TURN YOU INTO A FINE RED MIST!""

He doesn't have a normal m1, instead he begins to shoot his pistol, each bullet doing about 5 damage, but being hitscan. It has a firerate of two bullets per second and has infinite ammo, but every 12 shot needs ihm to reload for 3 seconds

  
His secondary ability is Slide  
""Hold still.""

Declan slide forward in a quick burst, he has Iframes for the entire attack and hitting a survivor with the slide stuns them and knocks them backward for 2 seconds, which combos perfectly with his m1

His 3rd ability is Dash Grab  
""COME HERE YOU BASTARD!""

Declan charges forward with his hand outstretched, this goes through counters. If he grabs a survivor he snatches their face and throws them flying, this deals 15 damage and ragdolls the survivor

His 4th ability is Coffee Break  
""Hoo... nice and hot.""  
Declan takes 3 seconds to drink a cup of coffee, and when it is done he has 5 seconds of unlimited ammo without having to reload and a 2x faster firerate

  
His 5th ability is radio call  
""Alright.... where are you all...""  
Declan takes out a radio from behind him and listens in on it, it reveals the survivors' locations and fills the air with a staticy radio song, which progressivley gets louder for survivors as Declan gets closer

his 6th abilty is grapple  
""Think fast!""

Declan outstretches his wrist, stands still and takes aim, and letting go shoots out a grappling hook that hooks him to surfaced and properls him towards them, if a grappling hook hits a survivor it drags them towards Declan

All in all, Declan is SPEED. he runs fast, shoots fast, and can close the gap fairly quickly, running around like an adhd goblin is when he is most effective. With his one weakness being that his gun is a weak source of damage, requiring decent aim to use effectively. While all the other Judges are like dark souls bosses, he is Doomguy while the Condemned are demons (Which is close enough)

  
For Skins, it'd likely be based on his inspirations and other related media

such as

A V1 Skin ""A MERE OBJECT.""

A Doomguy skin ""Launch the slayer.""

and a Pizza Guy skin ""Grant me my fate. Monster.""",1,1760744939.0,PENANCE_reddit,0,1.0,False

For my roommates, I'll call them Miguel, Raffy and Hector, all were also in their 20s and in college or working.

One morning, after waking up and taking a shower, I went to the kitchen to cook breakfast and there was Miguel (one of my housemates) leaning against the counter drinking a cup off coffee and this other man, who looked to be around late 40 or early 50, just sitting reading a newspaper and drinking a cup of coffee but I think it was from Dunkin. I had no idea who this man was but I assumed he was friends with Miguel or one of my other roommates so I didn't say anything.

It was normal at the time for us to bring friends over or people we were hooking up with.

Anyway, not long after, all of us were now in the kitchen, I was cooking and serving up pancakes, having our breakfast, TV playing in the background, etc. This whole time, this 40-ish/50-ish guy was just there reading a newspaper and none of us have said a word to him. Regardless, just to be polite, I also put a plate of pancakes in front of him and just asked him to put him in the sink when he was done. He nodded then went back to reading.

Anyway, after breakfast, Raffy then left for work, while Miguel and I left for class. Hector had the day off due to an arm injury so he just stuck around watching TV.

During the drive to the campus, I asked Miguel if he knew who that random man was. He said he just assumed he was friends with one of the other guys.

Later that evening, while we were all just relaxing in the living room, I asked if anybody knew who that guy was. None of us knew. Hector just said that after I, Miguel and Raffy left, the man continued sitting there, just drinking his coffee for a while longer, took his newspaper and walked out the door.

The man didn't even touch his pancakes so Hector just had it instead.

Literally, at no point, did any of us ask him who he was or if he knew any of us.

We never saw him again and to this day, it still kinda bugs me that I don't know who he was, why he was randomly in our house, how he got in and yeah.",3,1760744809.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

***PART SIX***:

Paco screeched to shut the door as went for his pistol. He shot three rounds towards *Her.* only one connected her shin but the bullet was enveloped like a wasp sinking into honey. Carson slammed the door shut. I was frozen. How could this be true? I was wrong all along, there are real monsters out here.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that? Reds fucking dead!‚Äù Carson yelled.

‚Äú*She* is the one responsible for the murder 16 years ago. I am sorry if this comes as a surprise, I thought you knew the risk coming here.‚Äù Paco replied.

‚ÄúWe thought it was just some sick murder‚Äù I replied, trying to remain calm. The three of us had our pistols out. Waiting.

‚ÄúNo, *She* torments the crow tribe. *The Red Woman*. It‚Äôs why I quit my job to move out here. Once I got involved, she never gave me peace. All I have been doing ever since is trying to do research on *Her*.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there anything we can do? I saw you shoot, can *She* be killed?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTo my knowledge, *She* cannot die. *She* was given power from dark forces. Story goes she belonged to a rival tribe, Crow fighters ambushed during winter. Killed everyone, including her unborn child. *She* was revived and has punished us ever since. There are rumors though, if we know her name *She* will leave us.‚Äù

Just as he said that something hit the roof of the cabin. *She* was crawling atop us.

‚ÄúDo you have any idea what *Her* name could be?‚Äù I asked.

Paco grabbed a book and started flipping through the pages before stating:

‚ÄúLisaxp√∫a‚Äì‚Äù

A shot rang. Carson shot Paco. Carson looked terrified.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do?!‚Äù I yelled.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt move on my own, I didn‚Äôt mean to. Help me!‚Äù Carson cried in horror.

I started towards Paco then ‚ÄúCRACK‚Äù, everything went dark.  
  
I woke up walking up to a house that looked all too familiar. My first homicide case. ‚ÄúNo, don't take me back here, I don‚Äôt want to see it again please!‚Äù I begged. I had no control over my movement. I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes. In 2017 I was 28 years old. I was with the man I was replacing, Josh Peck. Josh was retiring that summer and was training me on the job. We got called because neighbors on Burlington Street reported screaming and a gun shot. We were informed that the house belonged to an Everette Blanc, his wife Julie Blanc, and their 8 year old autistic son, Keenan. I never forgot their names. I never forget any of the names. I was back there, walking up with Josh. Pistols drawn, we walked in and there it was. The moment that changed my life. Everette shot Julie in the head and was wailing on his son Keenan with a box cutter. Over and over and over and over. ‚ÄúSTOP, STOP, STOP IT! WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME THIS AGAIN PLEASE GOD STOP THIS‚Äù I pleaded in my mind. So much noise within my psyche but all that was audible, was just the smushing wet noise of Keenan's collapsed face being punched in like mud on a wet rainy day. Over and over and over and over he kept smashing down on Keenan.¬†

‚ÄúThe boy wouldn‚Äôt stop screaming, he wouldn‚Äôt stop screaming. Screaming and screaming and screaming! That cunt right there wouldn‚Äôt let me get rid of him once we found out his condition. She brought this on herself.‚Äù Everett said while still calmly bringing the box cutter down on Keenan‚Äôs sunken face.

I was sick to my stomach. At the same time, Josh noticed Everett had his handgun on the coffee table next to him and Josh dived for it. It happened so fast, Josh grabbed Everett‚Äôs gun and shot him in the temple. In horror I looked at Josh. Josh then proceeded to wipe the gun of any prints and placed it in Everett‚Äôs hand. He looked at me and said:

‚ÄúWe tried to stop him, talk him down. He killed himself to escape justice.‚Äù

I was new to the job. It was the only job that the suspect was there committing the crime while I was present. I was shaking. Josh grabbed me and punched me in the face.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you gonna say boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe tried to talk him down, he pulled the trigger when we got here.‚Äù

¬†I really am a coward. My child will know his father as a coward. I never wanted kids after that. I was always so afraid. Afraid that I‚Äôd fuck the kid up or hurt them. Khalyn changed that in me, convinced me otherwise. She‚Äôs so good. I‚Äôm just afraid I‚Äôm no good, no good for her, for this job, or for my kid, for Keenan.¬†I live with a lie; I have been crooked from the start. God knows my crime and maybe this is his way of punishing me.

I never thought I was going to have to relive that. Then Josh‚Äôs face turned blank, letting me go. This wasn‚Äôt what happened next. Then without a moment's hesitation my body started walking to the back door. When I opened the door, I took a step and fell. I hit the snow hard. I was back to this never-ending nightmare. The infant wasn‚Äôt there this time. This time it was Keenan. His sunken face in my lap. His brains turned to mush mixed with the broken skull bones in a flesh soup. This poor boy. The culmination of my nightmares before *Her* was causing the blood to flow in the snow. I looked up and there the *Red Woman* stood still. The choir resumed its cursed melody. More voices than the last time. The three children with the infant, Carson, Kim, John, Red, Riggs, Captain Beck, Josh, Khalyn, Paco, Everett, Julie all joined the choir. Covered in blood they sang. They all danced to the melody of this witch. Spreading the blood on their clothes throughout the white powder on every spin.¬†

‚Äú*Listen, child of the plains and sky‚Äî*

*When the night turns red, don‚Äôt open your eye.*

*She walks the edge of the living and dead...*

*They call her The Red Woman ‚Äî*

*And her path is blood-red.*

*Oh, Red Woman, fire-born shade,*

*Haunter of silence, the forest afraid.*

*She dances through nightmares, she sings in your ear,*

*A shriek in the stillness, a hunger for fear.*

*They say she was mortal, a girl left to die,*

*Abandoned in snow with a scream to the sky.*

*Her heart turned to cinders, her soul split in two‚Äî*

*Now she walks with the wolves... and they howl when she‚Äôs through.*

*Crow child, run when her red eyes gleam,*

*She walks without sound, she slips through your dream.*

*If she calls from the dark of the cottonwood tree,*

*Your voice will be lost, and your bones will be free.*

*She whispers your name when the firelight's low,*

*Her fingers are smoke, her footsteps are snow.*

*Some say she flays you, some say she feeds‚Äî*

*But none who have seen her return from the reeds.*

*Oh, Red Woman, curse and flame,*

*A shadow etched deep in the Crow tribe‚Äôs name.*

*She roams through the blizzards, with blood on her breath,*

*Bringing silence and sorrow and beautiful death.*

*Hush now, child... don‚Äôt follow the cry.*

*When the stars go out, and the wind runs dry...*

*She waits in the cold, where the last light bled.*

*They call her the Red Woman...*

*And her path is blood-red.*‚Äù

‚ÄúNO NO NO, STOP IT PLEASE. ENOUGH SINGING! IM SORRY. PLEASE IM SORRY.‚Äù I screamed.

They did not stop. They just kept repeating. My wife walked out to me. Still singing. I turned around and the Red Woman was just walking slowly this time. I turned back to my wife and she arrived where I sat. Still singing.¬†

‚ÄúHoney what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I pleaded, hoping for an answer.

She stopped singing momentarily and said softly:

‚ÄúOur path doesn‚Äôt have to be blood red‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat? What does that mean, babe? Don‚Äôt leave me please!‚Äù I begged.

She did not look back. Khalyn turned back and grabbed the bloodied infant from one of the native children then walked away past the choir. Khalyn went into the blizzard out of sight. The choir still singing, still dancing.¬†

I was left there with Keenan‚Äôs corpse. I looked up and there *She* was. My first real look at *Her* but things were different. *She* wasn‚Äôt as tall or grotesque as I once saw. *She* was just a young girl, probably 20ish. Normal. The red blood stained snout, the long skinny limbs, the eyes, gone. *She* was covered in blood. A long slice down the buffalo skinned clothing around the stomach. *She* appeared pregnant. *She* looked down at Keenan then back at me. She offered her hand out. She wanted Keenan.

‚ÄúWhat do you want with him? What do you do with them? ANSWER ME!‚Äù I pleaded.

‚ÄúYou will never know.‚Äù She replied.

No malice, no hatred, just stated as a fact. She grabbed Keenan and turned around. She walked into the blizzard. The choir followed her, opposite of where Khalyn went. The woman's silhouette changed, and it looked like she was holding the hand of Keenan. *She* and the rest of the choir slowly danced into the blizzard out of sight.

When I was at college I used to work in libraries (but then my office at night). I used to work in coffee shops. 

  
Now I have a house which makes things a bit different - and this worked quite well for a few months. But then I found that I got bored of my desk or a bit of an aversion to it. I think this was related to a sequence of somewhat intractable problems.

  
Anyway - does anyone else notice that \*locations\* can get ""burned"" by work and do people have solutions for it. I think part of this is that I spent a lot my teenage years walking and running - so I might be sort of temperamentally built for movement.

  
Keen to know people's theories and if they have any approaches that work. I \*do\* want to mostly work at my desk for various reasons. I might try offloading certain tasks away from my desk. I might try getting some posters or something to add more interesting. Maybe changes of scene help. Maybe pulling certain specific activities (those that are less fun etc) away from my main desk would help. The thing is I don't really trust myself to have a ""general computer"" in two places and cleanly separate activities - so I think I want a bit of embedding the choice into the environment.",1,1760743984.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

LOGLINE

1980‚Äì81: While Holden obsesses over a pattern the BSU can‚Äôt yet name, Bill struggles to keep his family intact, and Wendy hits bureaucratic walls as a new administration reshapes priorities. In Wichita, a soft-spoken ADT technician rehearses control long before anyone connects the dots.

TEASER

INT. SUBURBAN BASEMENT ‚Äì WICHITA ‚Äì NIGHT (1980)
Dim. A single work lamp. Pegboard with neatly aligned tools.
A MAN in coveralls (DENNIS) threads a rope through a gloved hand. He breathes at a metronomic pace. On a nearby table: a binders‚Äô manual, a church bulletin, a stack of index cards labeled with women‚Äôs first names.

A washing machine clicks over. He looks up, calm. He slides the rope into a shoebox, places it beside three other identical boxes, and squares them perfectly.

ACT ONE

INT. FBI QUANTICO ‚Äì BSU OFFICE ‚Äì DAY
Phone rings. HOLDEN FORD stands over a wall map peppered with pins. BILL TENCH enters with two coffees.

BILL
You turned Kansas into a pincushion.

HOLDEN
Same offender, same fantasy. Break-in, bindings, phone lines cut, trophies removed. He‚Äôs cooling, but he isn‚Äôt done.

BILL
We don‚Äôt even have jurisdiction, Holden. Wichita PD‚Äôs running their own grids.

HOLDEN
They keep calling it random. It‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs rehearsing between acts.

WENDY CARR passes, catches the map.

WENDY
If you want buy-in from locals, start with language. ‚ÄúRehearsing‚Äù is theatre; ‚Äúescalation‚Äù is clinical.

HOLDEN
Call it what you want. He‚Äôll call again.

INT. FBI HALLWAY ‚Äì DAY
A DEPUTY DIRECTOR pins a memo to a corkboard: ‚ÄúPriorities ‚Äì Organized Crime & Narcotics.‚Äù Wendy clocks it.

INT. WICHITA PD ‚Äì DETECTIVES‚Äô BULLPEN ‚Äì DAY
Detective LARRY FINCH goes through a box of tips. His partner, SGT. EMILY TORRES, skims a stack.

TORRES
Phone creep. Same M.O. He called her at work first‚Äîasked for ‚ÄúJulie,‚Äù hung up.

FINCH
Our guy‚Äôs a phantom. Leaves us knots like he took a merit badge in it.

TORRES
Merit badge or ministry. Those notes sound like confessionals.

DENNIS, neat mustache, in uniform. A clipboard lists ‚ÄúLine Checks ‚Äì Residential.‚Äù His eyes flit to a cul-de-sac. He passes it, circles back, passes again. Noting blinds, routines.

I was young when I started this job, the youngest there in a big office related to the government. My boss was maybe 10 years older than me so coming up 30ish, and he was the ""cool guy"". Everyone loved him, he was pretty relaxed and a real whizz kid. He was the youngest of the leadership team and had established all these changes in the workplace that had left everyone pretty in awe of him. 

I was placed into his more specialised team right at the start and we developed a really strong relationship. It honestly felt like we just got each other and my work was really, really good. I was a top performer for months and he was always showering me with praise. 

A few months in I had a death in my family and I took a big hit, took a few days off work and my performance dropped for a week or two during which, my boss covered for me pretty hard and I was really greatful. He sort of took it upon himself to ""look after me"", buying me coffees and giving me time out, he would message me dozens of times a day on our work chat just checking in. 

We were friends on Facebook too and it eventually moved to messaging there, nothing harmful we just had a lot of hobbies in common. I was never at any point during this time flirty, in fact it never even crossed my mind until one day he told me he was getting a divorce and then things spiralled.

A week later we had a end of project team drinks night and it was fucking awful. He bought me drinks all night, I was an idiot and young and not really understanding what was going on. I got drunk and he was grabbing me and touching me all night, at one point he tried to pull me onto his lap in front of everyone and I pushed him off. One of my work friends even asked if I was okay. The worst part is I protected him because I thought he was going through a terrible time and I thought that's what I should do. I made excuses the next day when he apologised and I guess he realised he could get away with anything because it continued for a year. 

He would tell me he could get me into better positions, he could help me get ahead, I was so much better than my job. Then he would touch me and say horrible things, and even when I told him to stop (and I did so many times) he would devolve into how hard his life was, how we had such a strong bond. And he would make me look so weak in front of everyone else, he would buy me fucking flowers and parade them through the office to put on my desk, coffee every day, gifts. And all of my colleagues started resenting me because of it. I lost friends because they thought I was getting special treatment, which i was. 

He even told me he had already talked to HIS BOSS about our ""special relationship"" and she was fine with it.

My work performance suffered because he would message me ON THE WORK CHAT hundreds of times a day, genuinely hundreds. And I would beg him to stop sometimes but it would end in him talking about suicide. I'm so fucking embarrased this happened.
I quit my job over him, I got a better job in a different company. And before I left he told me I never would've got it without his help because he wrote to them without me asking and told them to hire me. I'm so fucking angry about it still. 

And then a year later I find out he got fired because when I left he did it to another girl and I could've stopped it if I wasnt so easily manipulated. I could've stopped that poor girl from experiencing it, I could've got him fired but I didn't.

And now I'm in another job and I'm so terrified of it happening again. I don't talk to my manager because he is a man of the same age and I'm scared it will happen again even though I know it won't and if it did I would recognise it this time.

I‚Äôve been interested in penpaling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in the many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I‚Äôd like to see if I can find that again.

I‚Äôm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn‚Äôt matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I‚Äôd like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you‚Äôre my state or half the world away, it‚Äôs you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let‚Äôs become familiar with each other to make sure we‚Äôre a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I‚Äôm designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it‚Äôs too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I‚Äôm an autodidact who‚Äôs been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I‚Äôve been young. I‚Äôm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I‚Äôm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

La Pavoni Vs Gaggia Classic [$700],"Hi, I'm down the rabbit hole. I've started with flair neo flex. It was quite decent machine but the workflow was terrible and there was too much parts. Meanwhile I've got DeLonghi Ecp 156 which I wanted to modify. I've installed dimmer mod but that felt nothing like on my flair where I use londinium style profile with 10s pre infusion. The mod itself didn't change much in cup and pre infusion without gauge was like walking through the fog. I felt like the shot was lacking the thickness, body while I have to admit that this machine could produce fair amount of crema (no pressurised btw). Then I pulled the trigger and bought second hand Cafelat robot and it was something new and different. The coffee from this machine definitely taste a bit better but the issue is still thinner body and usually I feel like I lose balance between acidity, bitterness and sweetness. These shots also feel a bit harsh in taste. I would prefer more delicate with great balance shots. I often can get these shots from speciality caf√© in my area but even with the same beans and recipe the shot isn't quite pleasant. I also bought cheap pid machine - hibrew h10b and tried to change pressure but the shot are also often quite harsh. What would be your advice for me in this case? Like real espresso snob, I'm thinking about buying next machine but I don't really know what should be my priority in the next machine. To this moment, I was thinking that maybe I'm lacking consistency in temperature or pressure, pressure profile is wrong but after all these machines I feel like every machine is different and it is hard to predict if the machine will be great based on technical data. Now my next bets would be La Pavoni since it seems to be quite similar to flair which I enjoyed for the most time or I would experiment with gaggia classic due to the fact that I can get cheap second hand and it is quite legend in espresso community. The third option would be spring lever such as used Elektra or Ponte vecchio but that feel a bit too much.

During my trip to Japan earlier this year, I fell in love with the art of perfume creation. I visited a place called My Only Fragrance where I created my very first scent and it completely hooked me. Since then, I‚Äôve been dreaming of opening a similar space in my home country, Poland.



There are a few studios here that offer perfume creation experiences, but they tend to be quite pricey and not very accessible for the average person. My goal is to build something simpler, more affordable, and open to everyone, a place where anyone can explore the world of perfumery in a fun and approachable way.



I‚Äôve been working with a few people in the industry, including one of the most experienced perfumers in my region who helped me put together a list of 70 raw materials that will form the foundation of our studio‚Äôs perfume creation experience. The idea is to offer a well-balanced palette, simple enough not to overwhelm beginners, but still rich and creative for enthusiasts.



Right now, we‚Äôre in the middle of setting up our first location (construction, interior design, etc.) while I‚Äôm refining the concept and our ‚Äúknow-how.‚Äù I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts on our planned materials list below.

We always made sweet declarations and didn't argue for three and a half months. One day, I went to the grocery store and on the way home, stopped at a dance club, stayed there for only 10 minutes, and then left. I told him, but he wasn't happy, saying I was disrespectful to the relationship. We fought and then made up. We agreed that I wouldn't go dancing without him anymore. But a few weeks later, he went for coffee with a friend. I told him how uncomfortable I was with the situation, and he said he meant no disrespect and we were friends. After that, we had a falling out and broke up. I tried to get back together with him, but he didn't want to. I talked about loving him and how happy we were together, but he said he'd made up his mind and there was no going back. I had anxiety attacks, panic attacks, and cried a lot, but he didn't change his mind. He said he gave himself to me and was happy with me. He cried when we broke up, that he wanted me as his wife, but because I'm insecure and we think differently, he prefers to break up. I cried, I begged, I begged, and it was no use.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Great San Juan Showdown: Independiente vs. San Mart√≠n de San Juan**  
*Where Math Meets Mayhem in Argentina‚Äôs Primera Divisi√≥n*

The 13th round of the Torneo Clausura 2025 has arrived, and with it, a clash that‚Äôs less ‚Äúepic rivalry‚Äù and more ‚Äútwo teams hoping for a miracle.‚Äù On October 19, **Independiente** (the ‚ÄúRojo‚Äù) faces **San Mart√≠n de San Juan** (the ‚ÄúCicl√≥n‚Äù) in a match that‚Äôs statistically predictable but narratively chaotic. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a referee‚Äôs red card and the humor of a player tripping over their own shoelaces.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers are in agreement: **Independiente is the slight favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **2.35** (implied probability: \~42.5%). San Mart√≠n de San Juan checks in at **3.4** (29.4%), while the draw sits at **2.75‚Äì2.9** (35.7‚Äì36.1%). For context, these odds are about as thrilling as a tie game of chess‚Äîclose, but not exactly a firework sale.

The spread? A half-goal line (-0.25 for Independiente, +0.25 for San Mart√≠n), suggesting this is a match where ‚Äúalmost winning‚Äù is a legitimate outcome. The total goals line is **1.5**, with over/under odds nearly even. In other words, expect a game where scoring feels harder than convincing a teenager to clean their room.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, History, and Why This Matters

Unfortunately, the provided news lacks juicy injury updates. No star players are sidelined by ‚Äúhamstring injuries caused by tripping over their own ambition‚Äù or ‚Äúmysterious cases of ‚ÄòTuesday‚Äô.‚Äù But here‚Äôs what we *do* know:

* **Independiente** is fighting for a top-eight finish in Zone A, with their ‚ÄúRojo‚Äù pride on the line. Their recent form? Let‚Äôs say they‚Äôre ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù like a coffee maker that sometimes forgets to brew.
* **San Mart√≠n de San Juan** is the team that *always* plays spoiler, like the friend who shows up to your party with a fanny pack and a passive-aggressive playlist. They‚Äôve got nothing to lose and everything to prove, which in football means they‚Äôll either shoc

I also take b complex daily (2mg) plus a magnesium & zinc supplement every night which I hadn't even realised has B6 in as it only states it on the rear label  3.6mg per pill, wtf!)

I only used to have them occasionally but lately Ive had 1/2 energy drinks just to get me through the day as I am so fatigued. These have 4mg each! I used to drink coffee but it tastes so bitter/ chalky that I can't have it any more (can b6 affect taste?) I also have a lot of ready made smoothies which I always keep in for the kids.

We had a lot going on for a long time now, one stressful thing to another and am constantly busy, I cant remember the last actual day off or even few hours I with nothing to do.

 A few weeks ago I hadnt slept well for a few nights running and was having delusions/ slight hallucinations all afternoon then the next few days I could barely move, pure anhedonia too. I saw my GP & was signed off work thinking I was just burnt out/ exhausted.

 I've had no energy at all & felt ill on & off with what I thought was a stomach bug, then today feel like I have high blood pressure but can't check it. I also have numbness/ tingling in my hands.

Sight changes I've noticed slightly for a while but they have ramped up massively. Felt overly cold in general even on warm sunny days and my legs get cold even under my blankets.

I can't believe how much makes sense, I know its not great to consume things, especially supplements without checking the rear label but my home situation means I barely get round to eating some days and I had no idea this was even a thing to be careful of as I've seen some packaging that boasts it has 3 x the daily allowance etc.

1o9g2d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1o9g2d6/hypomanic_relationship_crash_unexpected_visit/,Hypomanic relationship crash + unexpected visit feeling shaken,"Hey everyone,

Sorry for posting again. I just need to process something that really scared me.

TL;DR / background:
I was hypomanic recently and met a guy off Hinge. Within days, I had him drive two hours to meet me, we slept together, spent the weekend together, I introduced him to family, we talked about moving in, going overseas, even half-joked about marriage and a joint bank account. Wildly out of character for me.

When I started to crash, I told him clearly that I didn‚Äôt want to see him again and that I‚Äôd been unwell. I thought that was that.

But this morning, he showed up at my house unannounced‚Ä¶ two hours away ‚Ä¶ right as my sister was visiting. I was completely shocked and felt violated. I kept saying I didn‚Äôt want him there, but he just stayed while I literally trembled and looked around for help. My family didn‚Äôt really intervene, they even invited him for coffee. I‚Äôve met this man twice. I don‚Äôt even know his last name.

He brought gifts and a handwritten card saying things like ‚Äúread this when you‚Äôre sad,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely smitten with you,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here for you with big feelings.‚Äù
When my dad finally walked him out and told him to stop texting me, the guy said something like, ‚ÄúI can balance her highs and it wasn‚Äôt just an episode, the feelings were real. I can fix/save her.‚Äù

Now I just feel weirdly shaken, guilty, and unsure if I‚Äôm overreacting. My mum keeps saying it‚Äôs sweet and that I should be happy someone cares, but it doesn‚Äôt feel sweet, it feels scary and boundary-crossing.

I know I led him on when I was hypomanic and that makes me feel awful, but right now I just feel frozen and unsafe. Has anyone else had something like this happen after a hypomanic episode? How did you deal with the guilt and fear?",6,1760742407.0,bipolar2,1,1.0,False

1o9g0s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sortlist_Official/comments/1o9g0s2/geo_seo_the_secret_strategy_to_dominate_local/,Geo SEO: The Secret Strategy to Dominate Local Search in Multiple Locations,"If your business operates in more than one city, region, or country, regular local SEO is not enough.  
You need **Geo SEO**, the strategy that helps your website rank for *location-specific searches* across multiple areas.

It is how businesses like restaurants, agencies, and service providers get discovered by the right audience in the right place. Here‚Äôs how it works.  


# 1. What Geo SEO Actually Means

**Geo SEO (Geographical SEO)** focuses on optimizing your website for searches tied to a specific place or region.

Think of it like local SEO, but on a larger scale ‚Äî instead of ranking in one area, you are optimizing for several.

Examples:

* ‚Äúbest coffee shop in Chicago‚Äù
* ‚Äúmarketing agency in London‚Äù
* ‚Äúcar rental in Dubai‚Äù

With Geo SEO, you tailor your content, metadata, and structure so Google connects your business to each relevant location.



# 2. Why Geo SEO Matters

If your business serves multiple markets, generic SEO will limit your reach. Geo SEO helps you:

* Capture regional search traffic and rank in each area where your services are available.
* Boost visibility in Google Maps and local results.
* Build trust and relevance, since users prefer brands that speak directly to their local context.
* Increase conversions, because localized content drives higher engagement and intent.

It turns one website into a multi-location growth system.



# 3. The Key Elements of a Strong Geo SEO Strategy

Here‚Äôs what to focus on:

**a. Create dedicated location pages**  
Build unique, optimized pages for each city or region you target. Include location-specific keywords, content, and contact details.

**b. Use consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) data**  
Keep your business information identical across your website, Google Business Profile, and all directories.

**c. Optimize for Google Maps and local listings**  
Claim and optimize each branch‚Äôs Google Business Profile with photos, reviews, and accurate details.

**d. Add geo-targeted keywords**  
Include city or region names in your titles, meta descriptions, headers, and image alt text.

**e. Create local backlinks**  
Partner with local organizations, directories, or media outlets to earn trusted backlinks from each area.

**f. Use structured data (schema markup)**  
Help Google understand your multiple business locations with the LocalBusiness schema.



# 4. Common Geo SEO Mistakes

Avoid these pitfalls:

* Duplicating the same content across multiple city pages
* Forgetting to optimize Google Business Profiles for each location
* Using inconsistent contact information across directories
* Ignoring user experience and localized relevance

Search engines reward authentic and useful place-specific content, not repetition.



# 5. The Payoff

A strong Geo SEO strategy helps you dominate search results where it matters most ‚Äî in the markets you serve. It is a powerful way for multi-location businesses to scale both locally and globally.



**TL;DR:**  
Geo SEO helps your business rank in multiple regions by optimizing for local intent across each location. Create dedicated pages, maintain consistent business information, and build local backlinks and keywords to grow region by region.



**Your turn:**  
If your business operates in multiple areas, how are you managing local SEO at scale? Have you experimented with Geo SEO yet?",1,1760742287.0,Sortlist_Official,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve worked incredibly hard on this for the past few months and it would be great to get everyone‚Äôs thoughts and feedback. We hired an entire cast and crew and got a few of my friends to play extras in the background. Overall, it was a blast bringing this story to life!



We shot this entirely at Thumbody in Paramus, NJ over the summer. The owners there were incredibly collaborative through the whole process. If you‚Äôre ever in the area, you should definitely check them out! It‚Äôs literally a hidden gem considering they‚Äôre located in an office building.

Synopsis: After the death of his mother, Chris reconnects with his estranged father, Michael, who he hasn't seen in over a decade. Their meeting takes place at a coffee shop, where Chris hopes to get a quick signature to sell the family home. The conversation quickly reveals deeper emotional wounds and unresolved resentment between them. As the two navigate their complicated past, it becomes clear that Michael has an ulterior motive.

This is my busiest month for work so I thought I'd take a break and go get a coffee at a new coffee shop/cafe that opened near by.

So I drove over there and parked. As I was getting out of my car there were 2 girls who were parking beside me. I just glanced in their direction and walked inside. As I was waiting for my coffee they also came in. They talked to each other then one of them looked at me and said ""omg i saw you outside and thought you were andrew tate (i've been told many times that I look like him, similar look/build/height, just a better looking version of him I'd say lol). I was like 'OMG did Andrew Tate just give me the side eye?'"".

We just kind of laughed about a bit and then I got my coffee and sat down. They were still waiting for their coffee. While she was waiting she came up to me again and said ""Do you want me to take your dating profile picture?""

I had no idea what she was talking about but apparently I was sitting in a spot that is very instagramable so people will sit there and take pictures.

I didnt really say much to it as I was confused when she said, but I was also in my work mode/zone so was tuning most of the world out even in the first interaction.

She also had a really loud voice (where I felt like people were noticing) and came with this really high energy that I dont have even on my high energy days. So I honestly just froze up a bit because it really threw me off.

It is what it is. I'm not dwelling on the fact that I wasnt quick enough to create the back and forth banter.

I'm just curious if I should take it as a compliment or chalk it up to some highly extroverted woman making casual conversation.

I told my buddy about it and he said the first interaction may have been casual if that was where it ended, but the fact that she came up to me after to attempt a second one meant that she was into me and wanted me to engage.",1,1760741860.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
