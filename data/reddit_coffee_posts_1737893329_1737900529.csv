I am a pretty big Nintendo fan, and I would love to find someone who loves Pokémon as much as I do. Major points if you tell me who your favorite is in your message heh. I enjoy a variety of hobbies from gardening to baking to juggling. I adore animals and I have a very round cat. I am super into tattoos and piercings and have some of each. I have reeeeeally long hair.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1iaf8uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1iaf8uo/the_importance_of_rest_in_hustle_culture/,The Importance of Rest in Hustle Culture,"Ah, rest. The magical elixir we all seem to overlook until our brains start to feel like a foggy swamp and our to-do lists resemble scrolls from a medieval manuscript. I mean, who hasn’t felt that creeping exhaustion creeping up behind you like a cat stalking a laser pointer? We think we can outwit it, push through the fatigue, and drink one more cup of coffee while pretending we’re all fine. Spoiler alert: we’re often anything but fine.

Let’s get real for a second—without intentional rest, what do you have? A tired, stressed-out version of yourself that probably resembles a stressed-out raccoon trying to figure out how to open a trash can. Not the look you’re going for, right? When I talk about intentional rest, I’m not just referring to clocking out from work and binging some episodes of that super cool show everyone’s obsessed with (though, let’s be honest, that can certainly help). I’m talking about taking a beat in life to recharge your soul, recalibrate your thoughts, and come back to whatever you’re doing with renewed vigor.

Think about it this way: you wouldn’t drive your car until it’s completely out of gas, would you? Well, at least I hope not! You’d stop, refuel, and then—bam!—you’re back on the road, zipping along with newfound energy. It’s the same with our lives and productivity. Taking intentional breaks is like a pit stop for your mental and emotional engine. You can’t expect to maintain that long-term productivity and engagement unless you allow yourself the grace to stop, breathe, and fill up your tank.

There’s something beautiful about carving out time for ourselves, and I genuinely believe it’s a gift from God. As scripture reminds us, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). It seems like an obvious answer, but somehow it’s one we forget in our hustle and bustle. That invitation isn’t just about physical rest; it’s an encouragement for emotional and spiritual renewal, too. It’s about acknowledging that we’re human and that we need connection—sometimes with ourselves and sometimes with others.

So here’s my challenge for you: how can you create more space in your life for intentional rest? Maybe it’s stepping outside for a walk, throwing a mini dance party in your kitchen, or diving into a book that transports you somewhere completely different. Whatever it is, make it happen. It doesn’t have to be extravagant; it just needs to be intentional.

Remember, embracing rest isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s an acknowledgment of our shared humanity and the recognition that we’re better together. When we give ourselves permission to step back and recharge, we’re not just benefiting ourselves—we’re better equipped to serve our communities, support our loved ones, and feel more connected to our faith journeys.

So go ahead. Treat rest like the treasure it is. Take those moments to recharge, and you’ll find that you’re not just surviving, but thriving, and ready to tackle whatever life throws your way. Who knows? You might even find you have a bit more humor in your life, and let’s face it, we could all use a little more of that!",1,1737900069.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code: \

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Me specifically forgets to eat every now and then.
Breakfast never really been a thing as usually I wake up get ready and leave to work. I usually dont feel hungry till midday. I have a coffee in the morning

In November I stopped adding to it, with hope to start the compost process. By January, things were already decomposing nicely, but after heavy rain I had to drain the water and add browns to help dry the compost. Someone suggested I add coffee grounds to help kickstart the compost process, so I added that plus some bread that was becoming stale (no dairy). 

Does this mean that it will take longer for the compost to mature? Will it affect all of the bin? ",2,1737899890.0,composting,0,1.0,False

First, I want to say hello and I want to thank you for deciding to read onwards. To start, I'd like to informally introduce myself, I'm Cheems and I'm looking forward to build a meaningful and genuine connection with someone who desires the same and intends to make it work.   
  
To tell you something about my past, I have dated people before, but have not been in an official relationship yet... WAIT-- NOT because I fear commitment, but because the people I dated f\*\*\*ed up before we got there haha

  
Anyway, for some years, I abstained from dating because I got sick of spending my time and wasting it with the wrong people... but this year, I have decided that I'm ready to give it a shot again and open my heart to someone who really deserves it.... By this, I mean someone who is also ready, committed, and interested to form a wholehearted, genuine and worthwhile relationship. 

  
And as to the pacing of this potential relationship, I'd prefer na slow burn. If we start to get to know each other, let us establish our expectations first and be good friends. Once we build the trust, we can meet up and hang out, and if we're really for each other, we can exclusively date.  
  
If you're still that person, please continue.

the ones who  
sneak in front  
gives me   
new topics to write

everyone  
has a demon   
possess

either it  
becomes your   
master   
or you tame it  
or exorcise it   
by priests   
or doctors

self-exorcism   
is a must  
for those who   
can't afford   
the cure or   
procedure

better yet   
yielding the  
advice of   
more skillful  
and experienced  
fellow artists

the advice   
I found is   
all but the same;   
YOU MAKE ART

to survive   
you must create   
to live is to thrive

to face your demons   
you make art

your brush   
and pencil  
is your wand

or talk about him  
paint him   
until he's vanquished

no matter  
how strong   
you can defeat that   
self- sabotaging fiend

let the challenge   
be your friend

let the mountain you climb  
be your solace   
when you choose   
to create rather than destroy

you already defeat the enemy   
rather than complaining   
about the long line

write or compose   
God hates complainers   
and so do doers

concentrated action  
and strong wind   
whistles outside   
beyond my window

high quality actions   
only equal to art.

Once she planned a surprise party for his bday, I helped her out with some of planning, but my friend gadu edo penta pettadu, she got mad and didn’t come to party she worked her off. Ela chepukuntu pothe chalane unnayi incidents.

She had gone for a party yesterday, I and my friend went to pick her up. Pune traffic is quite frustrating-metro construction, narrow roads and some routes are diverted, this made my friend irritated. He was like why she had to go party today, when he was ill and roads were shit cramped. He even told he would scold her today. We reached and he called her, twice or thrice, we waited like 10 mins, she came out. As she approached, he started “why didn’t you lift phone, you would not know if we were dead coming to pick you” she told “she went to washroom and she was coming out” he continued ranting this and that chala thittadu, at one point if you didnt want come and want to go with someone else you can go 🤯🤯. Also, when she said that didnt go with anyone so he complaining about, he said “how would i know what you do after going office” 

She cried her heart out in the car entire way😔😔. He consoled her and said he all frustrated,  nothing more than that. He said like why she crying because of some words, they madr sacrifices, overcame situations, shouldn’t the importance to that rather to some words, she was still crying. 

Today when i woke up, she was cooking, cleaning and making breakfast for him, slightly roasting bread and coffee for my friend to consume on bed. She asked me what would like eating for breakfast. I saw my mom in her that instant. My friend on bed complaining that he got cold and fever due to her 😕🙁🙁 

TLDR: friend wife is a total angel, caring concerning and understanding. Friend says he loves her, might be showing love or whatever and convinces, but he doesnt treat her with respect, blames her for everything.

Does love gives that ownership to treat someone with no respect at all, why people have to lose their self respect to be with someone who denies giving respect but shows love? What madness is this",6,1737899055.0,bondha_diaries,6,1.0,False
1iaeuzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1iaeuzm/do_you_take_customer_complaints_to_heart/,Do you take customer complaints to heart?,"I work at a chain coffee shop where customers can submit surveys about their experience and the staff they engaged with. My store does very well with these surveys because we have many regulars and always go above and beyond for our customers. But occasionally we have times where we are not in the best mood or mindset and then get bad surveys.

I was working on Friday when a woman ordered a very expensive drink where my coworker confirmed a size with her. After I made it she said pretty coldly that she wanted a small. I told her that we accidentally got her down for a medium (like she asked for) but she can definitely have the larger size. I didn’t want her to feel skimped because she did pay for the bigger size. She said no she wants a small, so honoring that I took the drink and began making the small size. I will admit that I rolled my eyes the slightest bit. I was frustrated that I had to dump this perfectly fine drink and remake one that has a single flavor pump and a quarter of a shot difference. I gave her the small drink and she left. I only said one sentence to her and that was about the size. 

Later that day I got a very stern phone call from someone saying I was very mean and everyone at my store is rude and has an attitude every time her mom comes. So that means that this has happened before, but I know for a fact my coworkers always confirm sizes of drinks. I sincerely and personally apologized to her twice and asked if there was anything I could do for her. She declined all my efforts to make the situation right. The woman put in a survey saying that I and the rest of my team are only ever bitchy, nasty, and rude and she’s never coming here again. 

When things like this happen do you take it to heart? I am a firm believer that service workers do not need to be robots. It is unrealistic to expect us to always be happy and giddy. I try my best to shove any tiredness or bad moods down when I am working, but sometimes it slips. I also accepted my fault and I apologized to her because I know that I could have handled the situation differently. I am struggling to let this roll off my back and am curious to know what others think about situations like this. ",2,1737899024.0,barista,6,1.0,False

I’m a 34-year-old introvert from the Netherlands, looking to connect with someone from the EU who’s interested in meaningful conversations and shared quiet moments. Bonus points if you're also Dutch—makes spontaneous coffee dates a little easier—but I don’t mind traveling for the right person.

A bit about me:

Personality: I’m structured, reliable, and grounded. Think of me as the steady type—loyal, thoughtful, and a bit reserved until I feel comfortable.

Interests: I’m more of a ""walk in the park"" kind of guy than a ""scream at a concert"" one. Loud crowds and big events? Not really my thing. I’d rather enjoy a peaceful stroll or a quiet evening talking about life. I’m also a fan of fantasy worlds like The Witcher and Warhammer, so if you enjoy those too, we might already have something in common.

Values: Fairness and honesty are super important to me, both in life and relationships. I’m introspective and appreciate someone who enjoys deep, meaningful connections over small talk.


What I’m looking for:

A kind, grounded woman who values the little things in life—like quiet moments, thoughtful conversations, and just spending time together.

Ideally, someone from the Netherlands or nearby (makes those weekend meetups easier). But if you’re elsewhere in the EU, don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m happy to travel for the right person.

Patience and a sense of humor are always appreciated. Introverts like me take time to open up, but when I do, you’ll have a partner who’s all in.


Random bonus points if you:

Enjoy nature walks and exploring new places at a relaxed pace.

Share an interest in nerdy topics like fantasy, gaming, or tech.

Appreciate cats (my fluffy friend will definitely need to approve of you).

The cliff notes are there was a serious congenital problem they discovered late. We could have maybe continued to term and gone through surgeries and hoped, but my partner has a little girl, and her family had just been through exactly the same thing about 18 months ago with her nephew, unsuccessfully. If it was just our hearts and lives on the line I'd have wanted to take the chance I think. Tough choice anyway, to bring a child into the world knowing they're going to suffer from day 1... Anyway. I agree with the choice; it was the most moral thing we could have done to protect the most people from harm, and as my family and friends have found out, unless you want to get an alex ferguson hairdryer off me, it's best not to discuss it.

My partner has really withdrawn since we got the diagnosis. kind of before too, I think she was always worried it'd be like her nephew, and then with the diagnosis it was crushing for her. Now there's so much guilt. her guilt, my guilt, her guilt over my guilt. Showing each other our pain doesn't bring solidarity, just this cycle of regret. I don't know that we're going to get through this together.

And just personally, I really am just fucking *gutted*. Every which way. I have never felt this aggrieved. I'm kind of shocked at how bad it is, because I have experience in feeling like shit! tragic best friend's death; beloved dad; suicides; car crashes. I'm 38, my ""expected losses during the average human lifetime"" bingo card was already pretty full, and I thought the days of waking up and immediately crying for half an hour were behind me. I clearly didn't see the box marked ""feel guilty for not wanting to give a name you really like to your dead baby, then realise the name is ruined regardless."" 

I was really looking forward to being a dad. I was really looking forward to meeting my kid (who I failed before they were even born so I guess they dodged a bullet). I've lost an entire future. An entire potential rest of my life. And I'm really tired of grieving and days of waking up and pleading with myself to just go back to sleep so I don't have to cry for 30 minutes before I can get up and make coffee, and feeling joyless and dead.

I've always been more fascinated by numbers and enjoyed the projects the most where I was close to controlling/business planning. A CFO pathway seems very interesting to me. 

The problem is that I barely see that path walked from MBB in my region (i.e., you either have the PE/VC/Startup crowd or the corporate crowd which almost always exits to corp. strategy or some other functions like Ops). I also feel like that my MBB toolkit, while valuable, has way too little factual knowledge compared to i.e., a 4-5 YOE Big 4 transaction advisory/valuation profile. 

I think the smartest way would be to connect through linkedin with some senior finance leaders and ask them for a coffee chat/intro but maybe here are some people who landed a similar exit?

Their parents are usually passionate about their recovery too, supporting them every step, whilst loads of parents might not really care as much, not know how to support you, or even not know about your disorder.

I feel like my recovery would be way easier if I had these opportunities, you may say that you're not wealthy but for me as an example, I can barely afford necessities sometimes, I either wear the same clothes or my pj's everyday (except undies) because all my other clothes are from years ago, basically from my childhood or passed on from my sisters. I have to live off fear foods sometimes, I don't have my own food storage and I feel bad to ask my mum to buy something I'm fine with eating, because I know she will think that there's other food at home and I'm just being picky. 

I see these accounts avoiding eating bread more than 2 times a day for example, and it makes me feel like shit too, because sometimes all I could have for a meal is a simple sandwhich and then I'll feel bad for having another sandwich later in the day because people never show you that it's normal and their convinced it is such an evil thing to do. Recovery isn't aesthetic like those people make it seem, their just lucky on that specific part to be financially stable and have better support, recovery is chaotic and super challenging and all you can do is push through it.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

This is an ongoing series designed to teach people about crypto safety using stories.

These stories have been changed to protect the identity of the victim but are very much based in real world scenarios and describe an instance where a crypto asset owner got their wallet drained due to hostile actors.

Underneath is what the user could have done to avoid the hack.

The goal is to learn from other people's mistakes.

If you have any ideas for future stories, let me know in the comments.

Let's continue.

Victim: 24 year old man

Scenario:Johnny was very busy.  He was an intern over at R32Y, one of the premiere venture capital firms in the world.  He was near the end of his term and it looked like he would get an offer after he was done.  The grind had been crushing.  His slow weeks were 60 hours but 80 hours were more the norm, making edits to PowerPoint slide decks, balancing spreadsheets down to the penny, meetings, screaming, the repeated nervous breakdowns, and pressure.  So much pressure.  He slept maybe 3 hours a night and he was beginning to start feeling chest pains but he was so close.  Just a few more weeks and he could get an analyst job with the firm, put in his 2 years and be set for life. 

Considering he was the subject matter professional for crypto on his team, he was even thinking of starting his own consultancy firm to help companies understand and utilize crypto in a safe manner.

He saw a notification on his phone for his CryptoFort account.  There was an unusual transaction and they needed him to verify it. 

Without thinking he logged into his account via his phone, and denied the transaction.

Soon afterwards he got a call from the Partner in charge of emerging technologies who wanted him to come in and answer some questions about crypto.  This was huge.  If Johnny was able to impress the Partner that would fast track his career in a way that can’t be overstated.

He grabbed more coffee and rushed over to a room filled with high ranking firm members.  In the room were Partners, Executive Directors, Directors, and so forth. The people assembled were a significant portion of the upper management of the firm.  The net worth of the room was easily $100m and up, maybe much more.  Johnny thought he could be one of those Partner before 30 with only minor permanent damage to his health.

Johnny started by answering the basic questions.  What’s crypto, what’s the block chain, what smart contracts are, that sort of thing.  The head of markets said he wanted to see what it looked like to purchase crypto and Johnny agreed and shared his screen to walk them through buying some $PDQ.

This was the worst way to find out that his wallet was drained of $500k, his entire net worth gone.  His career was ruined.  Everything was ruined.  He clutched his chest, the strain was too much.  He fell to the ground as a single tear fell and everything went to black.

""Johnny's life passed him by  
Like a warm summer day  
If you listen to the wind  
You can still hear him play""

""Shooting Star"" by ""Bad Company""

How to avoid: 

Crypto is a demanding space and it requires a great capacity for stress.  Because of this there are certain things that crypto isn’t compatible with.   Any life situation or job that has incredible amount of pressure such as being a consultant or investment banker or going through a rough breakup.

If you are reading this and you are one of those type of people(and if you are you there will be no doubt), either you are making enough money that you are being greedy or you have much more important things to deal with than crypto.  If you are already into crypto, consider shifting into investments that don’t need to be actively monitored or if you looking into crypto, consider waiting until you are in a better emotional position.

If Johnny was calm and at peace, when the message from “CoinFort” arrived he would have reviewed it and seen it was a scam e-mail meant to get someone to give up their login information.  This is one of the most common forms of scams as it is easy to do.  The scammer sends an e-mail saying you need to do something with your account.  You go to a website or application, enter in your information(or link your wallet) and everything is withdrawn in seconds.

The way to avoid this is simple.  If you see a notification about an application go directly to that application.  So if you get an e-mail about “CoinFort”, delete the e-mail and go straight into CF to see what’s going on.  99% of the time the answer is nothing.

Meanwhile, I’m lucky if I’m coherent before my second cup of coffee.

I want to be one of those people. Like, how do you rewire your brain to actually enjoy mornings? I’ve tried setting my alarm earlier, but I end up hitting snooze until it’s basically pointless. I’ve thought about going to bed earlier, but my brain is like, “Nah, let’s scroll for an hour instead.”

For those of you who made the switch, what actually worked? Any tips to trick myself into getting up early AND being productive without turning into a grumpy zombie? Would love to hear your thoughts (and success stories, because I need some inspiration).

1. They often travel to places like Europe/the US/Dubai, whereas I have traveled the most to Taiwan/China, I much prefer to go to JB for a day trip than to take a plane nowadays
2. They often go to gym and fitness classes, the only time I did pilates was during my time in physiotherapy, I do go for this quite often and the physio has taken photos of me working out and I post them in the dating app.
3. They like dogs, but I personally don't like dogs and prefer cats. But I foresee I won't get any pets at home.
4. They often like to chill at Starbucks and Coffee Bean, I do eat at restaurants at times like Hotpot but I still prefer going to JB and eating, otherwise in Singapore mostly eat McDonald's, and local cuisine such as Bak Kut Teh.
5. In real life I tend to speak Mandarin a lot more even at the workplace, I won't consider myself eloquent in real life.
6. I don't care about what I wear, the most important thing is comfort first, appearance second.
7. I am nonreligious, 20% here of Singaporean is non religious, Christianity is out of the equation.
8. I mostly don't cook, I prefer eating out although I prefer breakfast sometimes.
9. My eyelid is a bit droopy, such that people think I am sleepy when I am not, I am against cosmetic surgery as I have a bit of dry eye and the doctor says I am not a suitable candidate.
10. I prefer watching political drama in Taiwan than anything else, maybe they prefer watching a play or a book or a movie?

I don't expect a 100% match as it is not so realistic, but this is what I mostly saw in the dating app Hinge.

I got the impression that women are quick to judge a book by its cover, as long as I reveal a few flaws, they will run. Also, they are in the best version of themselves, they might expect me to be better than them.

I have an hour commute for my new job so I’m tacking on an extra 12 hours to my week. I’m exhausted when I come home. And then he always leaves all his shit in the dish rack for me to put away. He doesnt take out trash. He doesnt do small cleaning of surfaces. Fine. But clear the dish rack. We’ve talked about this extensively. I’ve brought it up politely many times. Just hey man, can you please stay on top of your stuff, or hey if youre cleaning dishes put stuff away, cause I’m always having to put yours away and its not fair when if you dont want to touch my dishes. (He was stacking dishes haphazardly just to avoid putting anything dry away). I brought up how if he doesnt want to touch my dishes, maybe we should get separate dish racks. 

We stopped speaking a while ago cause he lied to me about cleaning shit water off the walls and floors. (There was visibly none of the huge paper towel wad he used in the garbages) and HE confronted ME about it and I asked why he lied and he went off gaslighting me and asking why I’m mad when we talked about it, how I have had people do so much worse so how could I say something, and how dare I accuse someone who works for a politician of LYING. 


Since then he told me hes moving out (wont communicate when though!), and he wont talk or look at me, and isolates himself and is barely home. Cool, whatever; I told him he isnt kicked out and this is his home too, I’ve given him food and he even reciprocated, like… hes self imposing the awkwardness. I dont really care, but its at a point where his self imposed isolation means hes neglecting his dishes entirely. I’ve brought this up already. Now all weekend the dish rack has been filled up his take out containers and my coffee pot. I use this coffee pot every weekday cause it auto brews. I consider it very rude hes left it there for me to put away for him. He even took one of his dishes out of the dish rack and didnt bother putting anything else away. Its Sunday now, its been there since Friday. 


How petty is it if I tell him he needs to stop using my stuff (dishrack and coffee maker) if he cant be fucked to just put things away. That I’ve brought this up too many times to keep asking nicely - I’ve even said to him look I’m not even asking you not to touch or use my stuff I’m just asking you to put it away. Idk. I feel like a huge monster with the way he acts around me but it feels SO fucking degrading after a 62 hour week to come home and be putting away his dishes because hes uncomfortable that I’ve essentially asked him to clean up after himself.

Advice PLEASE!!,"I (F18) and my boyfriend (M18) have been in a relationship for just over a year, but have been dating for around 2. We took the whole dating/getting into a relationship thing slow because of outside circumstances like friends, age, busy schedules, etc. Now that we have officially been together for a year though we are struggling to take things slow. We love each other, I (F18) am so blessed to have such an amazing man to be my rock. We’d love to be married and move in together. We want to move in together, but also both agreed we would not move in together until marriage (for a list of reasons from finances, worry about accidental pregnancies, and more). We know we are super young and I know people change so much between the ages of 18-25yo so it could be so risky getting married now, but we have have traveled together multiple times and we just absolutely love and adore to the little things together (drinking morning coffee, brushing our teeth together, watching a movie as we fall asleep, etc.) we like being slow together living our day-to-day life together which we cannot always do while living at home with our parents. He makes decent money (blue collar). But we are by no means rich we would be able to live comfortable with an affordable roof over our heads, and the necessities with maybe a little fun money every once in a while. I am currently on the job hunt but it’s been hard as a full time student. 

We’ve talked about some options from wedding details (elopement or small wedding, locations, dates, etc.) and living situations (RV/trailer living, apartment, buying a home) but each time it brings up worry amongst both of us and we argue a bit because neither of us want to “fail” or hurt our relationship or end up in major financial trouble. 

Our family is cause for this concern. My parents want us to be married before moving in, but my parents both consider us beyond young to get married. They made a comment that my cousin who is got engaged at 25 planned to be married in 2 years is “young” and “just about at the youngest possible age to consider marriage”. 
While his parents have mixed views his father states we should move in together if we please but to not get married. While his mother says to wait at least two years or ideally until we are 25 to get married. 
It’s not that our parents don’t like our relationship because my family loves my boyfriend, and I think it’s safe to say his family loves me. 

It’s just life experiences & their our personal “conservative” opinions. But we are scared they genuinely won’t even support us enough to show up to the wedding. 

And in all honesty the topic of marriage & moving in has caused more argument in the past month than we’ve had in the 4 years we’ve known each other (2 years dating). 

I understand there’s no rush. But I would truly appreciate some insight and obviously I cannot go to family about this as they are the issue. And our friends are just as young & dumb as us and tell us to dive in to the deep head first soo I would love some genuine advice. Thank you!! ",0,1737896513.0,Marriage,3,0.5,False

After around three weeks of buying a new Profitec Go the boiler was already starting to rattle while heating despite using a ECM/Brita water filter from the beginning.

Yesterday after descaling the machine, I found suspended particles in the flushing water. I was using Puly Descaler. Using bottled water now but the particles are still there.

The picture shows just water in a black cup. Doesn't matter if it's from the group head or the steamer.

The particles are very small and shiny. You can't grab them.

Anybody knows what it is and where it comes from?

I haven't paid close attention to the water before descaling so i can't really tell if it was there beforehand.

Thankful for any help :)

he also would beat me so badly to where I could barely sit because it would hurt. this went on from age 5 to 17.

When I was 8 my cousins dad came over no other adults were around. he made us kids do things to each other for hours then left. we never told anyone.

My mom never believed me nor did my grandma or any one else in the family. I was always called a liar, trash, stupid, and many other words. growing up I barely learned how to read and could barely spell. everyone made fun of me growing up. 

I never went to school, was always kept home to work in the yard or to handmow 10 acres of land or work in the field we had.
When I was 17, my step dad killed my 80 year old grandma who had severe asthma, he sprayed a full can of bug spray in the kitchen causing her to have a severe asthma attack and died that night. he did it on purpose for the will.

when I was 18 I walked in on my step dad and my moms uncle together in her bed. I told her that night infront of everyone, he threw hot coffee in my face and then my mom kicked me out of the house.

My mom was always trying to end her life, I grew up spending weeks in and out of the hospital by her bedside from overdoses. 

Was homeless from age 18 to 35. no one would hire me.
Lost my mom when I was 25, my biological dad when I was 23, only knew him for a few months. 

Didn't learn to read or write until I was 18/19 and homeless. That is also when I learned I had dyslexia and minor brain damage from years of beatings from my step dad.

Fast forward to today after 30 years of abuse from my family. my aunts, my cousins and being outcasted by them for over 10 years. I am turning 44 monday and I can't keep living like this.

I was diagnosed with Cptsd, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe social anxiety and suicidal ideation. I have no friends and go months with no one to talk to, i have no one to game with and I have no support from anyone. I owe 3 years of payments on 3 different credit cards and I am -180 in the bank and living on ssi. I can't keep going like this...

I have never had a girlfriend, women don't want me, I have never had a vehicle and I desperately need a minivan to help me get around to places. I had a crown break off and can't get to a dentist because of no dental insurance. I was never taught dental hygiene growing up and now I need all of my teeth pulled and dentures but cannot afford it.

I live in a very small town in texas that is 30 miles away from anything and have to doordash everything which costs so much.

 * Gaggia Classic Pro:
   * Pros:
     * Legendary machine, highly customizable, great for learning and experimenting, relatively affordable.
     * Durable and repairable.
     * Strong community and tons of resources available online.
   * Cons:
     * Requires more manual effort (grinding, tamping, etc.).
     * Steaming milk can be challenging to master.
 * Siemens EQ900:
   * Pros:
     * Fully automatic, one-touch espresso and milk drinks.
     * Consistent results with minimal effort.
     * Built-in grinder.
     * Sleek and modern design.
   * Cons:
     * More expensive.
     * Less customizable.
     * Potential for more expensive repairs.
     * May not be as repairable as the Gaggia.
My needs:
 * I want to make high-quality espresso and milk-based drinks at home.
 * I'm willing to learn and experiment, but I also value convenience.
 * Budget is a consideration, but I'm willing to invest in a good machine.

1iad83w,https://www.reddit.com/r/limbuscompany/comments/1iad83w/theory_regarding_the_coming_cantos_and_dantes/,Theory regarding the coming cantos and Dante's ability,"Basically what the title says. After spending way too much time attempting to piece together several bits of lore spread across all of the brainchildren of Project Moon, I think I've put together a decent-ish theory about whats to come.

Note: I am not going to be theorizing what is going to be happening in each of the coming cantos, this post is strictly on relating the sinners to the Sephirah due to the Sapling of Light, otherwise known as Durante, abilities that have been manifesting in our dear manager as of late.

Also note that this post contains some spoilers for Lobotomy Corporation.

So, to lay some ground work. What do we know about Durante so far- Well they are the powers of Dante after he's resonated with the golden boughs. The first one we as managers have unlocked was that of Pigritia, sloth, And we unlocked that in Canto 6, Heathcliff's chapter.

Now Pigritia, as we know, uses the icon for the Floor of Religion of Library of Ruina, otherwise known as Hokma's floor.

Now after thinking over it for some time, I was reminded of something from Lobotomy Corporation-

Hokma is one of the many Sephirah featured within the games of Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina, however I will mainly be focusing on the foremost. Now Sephirah are the department leads for the various floors within the facility of Lobotomy Corp, and they serve as the ""boss"" fights so to say during certain portions of the game called Meltdowns.

When a Sephirah's meltdown is completed, the seed of light is germinated, and you are awarded with a certain quote that is used later in the game for Lobotomy Corp's manager to stand up and persevere against his inner demons.

Those quotes are what I'm going to be focusing on for now.

Hokma's quote was: ""The Eye Embracing the Past; Building the Future""  
Which when put into context with Heathcliff's canto, I think it fits quite nicely. He embraced his past (Catherine) and is now building a future for himself with Limbus Company.

Next, for the reason I put Canto 7 spoiler tag on this.

In Canto 7, we unlock Superbia, which utilizes the Floor of Philosophy from LOR, also known as Binah's floor.

Now Binah also had a quote when you completed her meltdown, which was as follows  
""The Eye Facing the Fear; Breaking the Cycle""  
I don't think I need to explain why this fits Don Quixote immensely. 

With those two in mind, I started to think about the remaining cantos, the rest of the Sephirah, and what it could mean going forward. So below you can see the brunt of my theorizing.

Canto 8, Hong Lu's chapter. Now, going off the order of Sephirah, Hong Lu fits nicely with the wonderful coffee drinker Chesed. 

In Lobco, Chesed's meltdown quote was: ""Those who are Faithful and Trustworthy"",   
Which I think fits Hong Lu quite well, out of all the sinners who is more honest than good ole Hong Lu, ever since the beginning he's never kept anything secret, being quite open about his family's... tendencies. 

Now, assuming that the rest of the cantos will continue to yield Durante abilities, I think in Hong Lu's canto we will unlock Avasitia (Gloom).

After Hong Lu's canto, we have Canto 9, Ryoshu. Continuing in the order, we'd have her line with Gebura, Kali, the Red Mist, now, this is just a given at this point. Those two are made for each other.  
Gebura's Sephirah quote was: ""The Courage to Protect""  
Now you might scratch your head and asked ""Why would Ryoshu's canto line up with Courage to Protect?""  
And to that I say, she's a mother, just think about it.

Also she's definitely Ira (Wrath).

Continuing-

Canto 10, Meursault. If my theory in order is correct, Meursault would line up with Tiphereth, who's quote was: ""The Expectation for the Meaning of Existence"", now, I haven't read his book, but going off the vague knowledge I have of his character, this quote lining up with Mr Salt tickles my brain in a way that I like.

I couldn't really decide what sin I thought he and Tiph fit, I'm thinking maybe Invidia? (Envy) Unsure.

Canto 11, Outis. Outis, my favorite sinner, lines up with the amazing uncle Sephirah Netzach, who might I say we did get as an announcer in the recent Walpurgis along with Outis' best ego, so they have established an appearance together already. Anyway, Net boy's quote was: ""The Fearlessness to keep on Living"", now, I won't get into recapping the Odyssey, but knowing Odysseus's long journey to get home, just kind of fits.  
  
I'm thinking Gula (Gluttony) for Outis, not 100% though.  
  
Lastly, Canto 12, Faust, which lines up with everyone's favorite and adorable Hod. Hod's quote was: ""The Hope to be a Better Person"", and before you say it, yes, it doesn't immediately ring like a Faust thing, however, here's where I brandish my (skimmed) knowledge of the book. In certain versions of The Faust, the titular character, after spending much of the book being drunk on their powerful knowledge, realizes that it was wrong and changes to be a better person, which ultimately does save their soul from the devil Mephistopheles. So Yeah, I think it fits.  
  
Also Luxuria (Lust), because I'm out of options. 

Now, we approach my most copium of theories. We, dear managers, have two more Sephirahs left. You might ask, but we're out of Sinners Mr Mixtape, whatever do you mean, and to that I say WRONG.

Canto 13, Dante. Yes, Dante, our beloved manager self. Continuing along the track, Dante lines up with Yesod, who's quote was: ""The Rationality to Maintain Discretion"", and that dear reader, sums up Dante's journey thus far, from a bumbling leader in over his head, to a bonefied manager, learning to be the best manager for the sinners he can be.

But wait, I said there was two more sephirah right? Who could possibly be the last one.

Canto 14, Vergilius. Yeah I'm going there. I think the big ending to the Inferno saga is going to be Vergilius' canto, and do you wanna know who he lines up with? Malkuth, and her quote: ""The Will to Stand up Straight"", and if that doesn't sound like the peakest way to describe Vergilius's journey and ending.

Thats it for my theory. I know this all hinges on the idea that we're even unlocking more Durantes in each of the coming cantos, but oh well I'm writing this at 6 am and had to finish it. I know it's kind of shit in formatting but I don't use reddit all that much so I apologize, but anyway, hope ya enjoyed reading my 'tism scramblings.",9,1737894231.0,limbuscompany,1,0.85,False

Met all sort of strange folks , also the conversation was pretty dead. My question to you all is how do you even decide that you have found the right person in the process.


I thought for the AM route on paper my profile was ideal and nice. Im 6ft tall , look conventionally attractive and earn close to 50 Lpa. But i feel that number of people in urban settings like me willing to do an arranged marriage have drastically reduced since parents and their kids have different expectations wrt marriage and an ideal partner altogether.

All the girls i talked to or met i was able to see them on dating apps too, im pretty sure to conversations there might not have been so super formal. But this highlights how matrimony platforms are not working out yet most people in my circle are paying for premium subscriptions both guys and girls. I have not had issues with getting matches on a dating app top but that is pretty exhausting for me and for someone looking for something as serious as marriage it doesn't works either cause there is always a problem of plenty for people having so many options.

Coming to the type of people i met via AM setup.


One girl came with an ipad and was marking some checklists, apparently she wanted to compare 6-7 guys she was meeting over a weekend lol.

Then there are the usual kundali nonsense.

Weirdest was that once met a prospect for coffee and her bf was there too in another table she asked me to reject her as her parents are behind her back to get married and she already has a guy (pointing to him) and they both need couple of years more.",12,1737894079.0,Arrangedmarriage,5,0.93,False

1iad4xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1iad4xg/roommate_wanted_fm/,Roommate wanted (F/m),"Tim adjusted his glasses as he sat back at his desk, reviewing the online ad he had just posted.

**“Roommate wanted,”** it read.  
Tim preferred to live alone, but the silence in his big house had started to feel oppressive lately. Besides, a little extra money never hurt. He had even specified in the ad:  
**“Preferably male.”**

He hoped for someone quiet, maybe a fellow nerd who would enjoy a Marvel marathon or a good board game every now and then. He smiled at the thought.

A few days later, the doorbell rang. Tim wasn’t expecting anyone, so he walked to the door curiously.

When he opened it, he was greeted by a young woman—no, *a whirlwind of energy.* She was in her early twenties, with long dark hair tied into a high ponytail and designer sunglasses perched on her head. She wore a leather jacket, ripped jeans, and boots that looked like they cost more than Tim’s monthly groceries.

“Hi,” Tim started awkwardly.

But before he could say anything else, she swept past him into the house, her heels clicking on the hardwood floor.

**“Wow. This is... cozy,”** she said, her tone making it clear she meant the opposite. She walked into the living room and began inspecting everything: running her fingers along the bookshelves, lifting his Marvel action figures, and peering out the windows.

**“Um, excuse me, who are you?”** Tim asked, hurrying after her. **“And—what are you doing here?”**

She didn’t answer. Instead, she turned around and fixed her sharp eyes on him.

**“This is your lucky day,”** she declared, as if she were doing him a massive favor. **“I’ve decided to move in.”**

Tim blinked. **“What? No, wait—you can’t just decide that! I specifically said I was looking for a man as a roommate.”**

She raised an eyebrow, crossed her arms, and took a step closer to him. **“Are you seriously trying to ruin your lucky day?”** Her voice was low and icy now, cutting through his protests. **“I’m moving in. Period.”**

Tim stammered. **“But—but I—”**

She raised a hand to silence him. **“Where’s the kitchen?”**

Before Tim could point her in the right direction, she found it herself. She pulled out one of the chairs and sat down, like she already owned the place.

**“Alright, let’s do this. Contract. Let me see it,”** she said, snapping her fingers impatiently.

Tim, still stunned, went to his desk and grabbed the printed agreement. He carried it over to her, trying to regain some control of the situation. **“Look, I really think we should discuss—”**

She reached into her pocket, pulled out a cigarette, and lit it. She leaned back in the chair, exhaling smoke casually as Tim stared in horror.

**“Whoa, whoa! No smoking in the house!”** he exclaimed.

She smirked, taking another drag before saying, **“I live here now, Timmy. I’ll smoke wherever I want.”**

**“It’s Tim,”** he corrected weakly.

**“Timmy suits you better,”** she said with a condescending smile. **“Now, be a dear and get me an ashtray.”**

Tim hesitated but decided it was better to comply. He rummaged through the kitchen cabinets, but he didn’t have an ashtray. By the time he returned with an empty mug, she had already flicked her ash into his glass of cola on the table.

He froze, staring at the ruined drink.

She glanced up at him and laughed, blowing a puff of smoke in his direction. **“Relax, Timmy. You’ll learn to loosen up.”**

Tim clenched his jaw and set the mug down, trying to stay calm. He held out the contract. **“If you’re serious about moving in, then we need to go over the terms—”**

Before he could finish, she pressed the glowing tip of her cigarette into the contract, leaving a burnt hole in the paper.

She smiled sweetly. **“Timmy, I’ve decided: the first six months, I’m living here on a trial basis. Rent-free. I need to make sure I’m comfortable.”**

Tim’s jaw dropped. **“Rent-free? That’s not how this works!”**

She stood up, brushing past him. **“Oh, it is now. And speaking of comfort, we’re going to get my suitcases. You have a car, right?”**

Tim opened his mouth to protest, but the look she gave him made him think twice.

**“Well?”** she demanded.

Tim sighed, defeated. **“Fine. But it’s Tim. Not Timmy.”**

She smirked, grabbing her sunglasses from the table. **“We’ll see about that, Timmy.”**

  
Tim jingled his car keys nervously as they stepped into the garage. The space was tidy, with neatly arranged tools and shelves lining the walls. But the centerpiece was unmistakably the gleaming pride of the room: Tim’s car. A sleek, black sports sedan that he had saved up for years to buy.

Nuria stopped in her tracks, her eyes lighting up like a kid on Christmas morning. **“Oh. My. God.** ***This*** **is your car?”**

Tim smiled sheepishly. **“Yeah, it’s my baby. I try to take good care of it.”**

Nuria walked around the car, running her fingers along the smooth surface. **“Hmm, it’s not bad, Timmy. Not bad at all.”** She turned to him with a mischievous grin. **“Hand me the keys.”**

Tim’s grip tightened around the keys. **“Uh... no offense, but I don’t really let anyone else drive it.”**

Nuria stepped closer, holding out her hand. **“Keys. Now.”**

Tim hesitated. **“Look, I just don’t think—”**

Before he could finish, Nuria reached out and plucked the keys from his hand with practiced ease. She gave him a pointed look, shaking her head.

**“Timmy, let’s get one thing straight. I’m living in your house for six months. On trial. If you keep being this difficult, it’s going to feel like** ***very*** **long six months—for** ***you.*****”** Her tone was light, but her smile had an edge to it.

Tim opened his mouth to argue, but nothing came out. He sighed instead. **“Fine. Just... please be careful.”**

Nuria didn’t answer. She was already sliding into the driver’s seat. Tim barely had time to get in on the passenger side before she turned the ignition. The engine roared to life, and her eyes gleamed with excitement.

**“Buckle up, Timmy,”** she said, smirking.

Tim fumbled with his seatbelt, but before he could click it in place, Nuria slammed her foot on the gas pedal. The car surged forward, pressing him back against the seat.

**“Whoa, whoa! Nuria, slow down!”** he exclaimed, gripping the door handle for dear life.

Nuria just laughed, her hands steady on the wheel. **“Relax, Timmy. I’ve got this.”**

**“I’m serious! This is a residential area!”** Tim protested as they sped past rows of neat suburban houses.

She glanced over at him, completely unfazed. **“You worry too much. And don’t worry about speed cameras. Those tickets aren’t** ***my*** **problem.”**

**“They’re** ***mine*****! That’s exactly why—”**

Before he could finish, Nuria cranked up the car’s stereo. The bass thudded loudly as she turned onto a main road, accelerating even more. Tim closed his eyes and muttered a silent prayer.

After what felt like an eternity to Tim, they finally pulled into the driveway of a large, elegant house. The sprawling lawn was perfectly manicured, and an ornate fountain stood in the center of the garden path.

Nuria parked the car, turned off the engine, and stepped out. Tim followed, his legs a little shaky.

The front door opened, and a woman stepped out. She was in her late forties, with striking features and an air of effortless elegance. She was wearing gardening gloves and holding a small spade, clearly about to start working on the flower beds.

**“Hi, Mom,”** Nuria called out casually. **“I brought my new roommate.”**

Tim started to introduce himself, but Nuria cut him off. **“This is Timmy,”** she said with a sly grin. **“My housemate.”**

Tim winced. **“It’s actually Tim—”**

**“Timmy,”** Nuria said again firmly, her voice leaving no room for argument.

Nuria’s mother, Eva, smiled politely. **“It’s nice to meet you, Timmy,”** she said, clearly unaware of the tension.

Tim forced a smile. **“Nice to meet you too, ma’am.”**

Eva held up her spade. **“I was just about to start weeding the garden. But I can come inside for a bit—”**

Nuria cut her off. **“Mom, you’re not doing that.”**

Eva frowned. **“What do you mean?”**

Nuria sighed dramatically. **“Manual labor isn’t for women. Timmy can do it.”** She turned to Tim, her expression sharp. **“Right, Timmy?”**

Tim blinked. **“Uh, well, I mean, I could** ***help*** **if you’d like—”**

Nuria raised a hand, cutting him off. **“He means he’ll handle it, Mom. Don’t worry about a thing.”**

Eva hesitated. **“Are you sure? I don’t want to impose—”**

**“No imposition at all,”** Nuria said breezily. **“Timmy loves to help.”** She clapped him on the shoulder and gave him a pointed look. **“Don’t you, Timmy?”**

Tim opened his mouth to respond, but the look Nuria gave him silenced any objection.

**“Yeah,”** he said weakly. **“Of course.”**

Eva smiled warmly. **“Well, in that case, thank you. I’ll show you what needs to be done.”**

As Eva led him to the garden, Tim glanced back toward the house. Through the window, he could see Nuria and Eva sitting at the kitchen table, chatting and laughing over cups of coffee.

Tim sighed and turned back to the flower beds. He had a feeling these six months were going to be even longer than he’d imagined.",3,1737893953.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

I developed feelings and met up for coffee a week after. It was only after this my suspicions regarding her having someone began to grow. Until I found out that yes, she has someone. And I say I had to find out because she's NEVER mentioned having a guy even though we've hung out and have talked for 6+ months. She legit AVOIDS mentioning him. Isn't that odd?

So again, over the next several months we talked a lot, and finally began to hang out a bit in November. We saw a movie at a dine-in theater, went to a park, had coffee 2 times and now just saw her at an event. Thankfully I mentally prepared myself that her fiance might be there. (Long distance, he visits ever so often) And I was right. 

And I was soooo uncomfortable. I didnt know how to approach her. Cause I don't know if he knows about me. And I dont know if she wanted me to meet him. So I stood my ground on one side of the event, and she walked across on her own to greet me and hug me. We talked a bit, took a photo with someone else and then we departed. I didnt want to make her or him feel any more odd about me. But idk, did I make things look worse by avoiding her in a way? Cause I greeted everyone else's partner except hers. She could've brought him over to greet me but he stood back alone. 

Yes, I know. I'm trying my hardest to detach and focus on being good friends, cause we do make good friends. I want to be more and I've tried to be more but maybe she's just been nice to me and wants to keep her private life private, right?

Edit: I also wanted to add i gave her birthday and Christmas gifts over the holidays and well, they were pretty great gifts. Not too much, but very meaningful things. She does like me for sure as a friend, we have plans to work together again and has even agreed she's down to hang out with me on more exclusive date-like outings. But her not telling me about her fiance just throws me off so much",3,1737893642.0,dating,8,0.8,False
