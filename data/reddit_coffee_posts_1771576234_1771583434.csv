1r9rp2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r9rp2x/somethings_moving_in_the_vent_at_my_workplace/,Something’s moving in the vent at my workplace,"You know, I’m not really a superstitious person, I believe most things in our world have a logical explanation, though this time, I’m not really sure I want to know it.

I’ve been workin in a server room as a technician for a few months now, and things have gotten unsettling recently, to the point that I don’t really feel safe walking around that endless labyrinth of neon lights and black plastic.

It was cool when I first got here, but now it feels like I’m on the set of Alien

Three days after I started working there, as I was replacing some components I heard something bumping in the vents. At first I thought it was a rat, bad news for a place that needs to be squeaky clean, so I reported the issue to my superior who said he would bring it to the higher ups.

Of course, the suits, in their overwhelming presumption, undermined the situation, so we had to deal with this constant thumping over our heads, there seemed to be only one though so nobody got particularly worried about it, and over time we kind of got used to it.

A senior coworker even named the thing “Gerald” So every time we heard a quick rattling over our heads, as a joke we all started greeting the little guy.

It was funny for a while, until we started suspecting that “Gerald” was no rat.

When we came into work one day, we noticed some big scratch marks that tore the vents slightly open, as if somebody cut the metal with a knife.

Rats chew on stuff, but their teeth aren’t fucking Katanas.

Once again we reported our findings to our superiors, this time however, they decided to call a rat catcher.

How can a rat do THAT to a metal ventilation shaft?! it’s as if their brains just processed what we said in our previous complaint, while ignoring the current one.

Later that day, I saw the poor bastards that had to wrestle whatever the hell Gerald was coming into the server room, we told them what we knew and showed them a couple of pictures of the damage to the shaft.

They didn’t even flinched when they saw the cuts, they just looked at each other and shrugged it off.

I wasn’t sure if they had seen worse or if they were just too dense to understand that’s not something a rat can do.

So we waited upstairs near a coffee machine, while talking with some other employees about the situation.

To my surprise, everyone has been reporting the skittering months before I even started working here.

Though since the server room is the only area of the building with exposed ventilation, it’s the only place where some serious damage was visible.

Something didn’t add up, I know the suits are greedy bastards, but if this is happening all throughout the building, wouldn’t they be worried too?

Two hours passed, and the rat catchers were nowhere to be found, then I heard a rattling just above our head.

“Those idiots down stairs let Gerald get away!” I thought to myself, so I decided to go downstairs to see what those goobers were doing.

I bet they were the cheapest the suits could find, greedy fucks…

When I got into the server room though, there was nobody there.

I stood there for a moment in shock, waiting for a footstep or a light cough, but nothing, just the constant buzzing of the server room.

The lights had seemingly gone out, only the bluish glow of the server’s lights illuminated the room.

For a moment I thought those idiots just left, but when I went deeper into the room, I saw some of their equipment just laying there, abandoned in the many rows of servers.

There was no sign of a struggle, nor a cartoony splash of blood on the floors or walls.

Then I heard it again, the skittering.

He was back

He started moving around the vents, this time at a much lower paste.

I couldn’t understand where he was, the sound of him crawling echoed through the vents like a war drum

Then I heard a loud thud, coming from a few rows on my left as if a heavy weight fell on the floor.

A low guttural chattering filled the room.

I didn’t move, I stood still frozen in fear, my lips shut, my fists clenched

The chattering then stopped

The door wasn’t too far from me, if I stayed calm and rushed as fast as I could, I would’ve made it

But right when I was slowly positioning myself towards the door, the chattering began, this time louder and more high pitched, accompanied by the wet sound of countless limbs slamming against the floor

He knew where I was, he was coming for me.

Without hesitation I rushed towards the door, even when I could feel his putrid rotten breath on the back of my neck.

I slammed the door shut as Gerald pushed harder and harder with his body.

Then, without reason he gave up.

He once again emitted that low alien sound with whatever mouth it may had, and crawled back deeper into the server room.

I ran back upstairs bursting in tears, terrifyied that the beast could’ve been right above my head.

A large group of employees grouped around me as I came back, pale as a corpse, with my heart in my throat, sobbing like a grieving widow.

I told what happened to me and what probably happened to the crew.

Begrudgingly they all seemed to believe me, and one of my team proposed to go straight to the guys up top to ask them directly and lots of people agreed

A small platoon gathered up to represent all of us in front of the secretaries desk waiting to meet the board of directors, but she wouldn’t budge, insisting they were on a very important meeting.

It didn’t matter, a guy from accounting stormed in like a bullet train, and then he stopped.

“A very important meeting uh?!” He shouted, showing us the inside of the meeting room.

It was empty, not just devoid of people but of furniture too, the room was just a dud.

We urged the secretary to tell us what was going on, but she seemed clueless, she never even saw the suits she was just meant to keep people out and report complaints via email.

We heard rattling above us once again

We decided to leave, immediately.

The whole building has gone on strike now, but the board isn’t responding.

Legally I can’t say their name because of some defamation bullshit, but as they are a global corporation I feel obligated to say this to you.

Individually they look harmless, but together they wipe out the balance. 

For people who manage to have money left at month end, what are you doing differently? 

Is it strict budgeting, using cash instead of UPI, setting daily limits, or just higher income? Curious to know the practical habits that actually work in real life.",1,1771582731.0,EntriFinacademy,0,1.0,False

I'm an OFW going home to the Philippines this coming summer. As a big foodie, I would like to ask for your restaurant/cafe recommendations in Metro Manila that you think are worth trying. It's only been 2 years since I last came home but I feel like there are a lot of new places to try. 



**I'm looking for:**

* Any restaurant worth trying (Not looking for anything in particular, it can be a *karinderya* or fine dining as long as you think it is worth it)
* Any cafe recommendations with good iced coffee and match

**Some other notes:**

* I'm not picky with cuisines, I love trying anything. 
* I usually get Japanese and Chinese food when going out.
* For Filipino food, I love sisig, pares and dinakdakan. For other common Filipino dishes, I don't usually go out to get them because we would have it homecooked.
* I live in Mandaluyong/Makati area. Taking recommendations in Pampanga too since I have family there.

  
**Here are some of my fave restaurants in the Philippines for reference:**

* Pilya's Kitchen
* Mila's Tokwa't Baboy (Pampanga)
* Pares retiro
* Manmaru
* Yakiniku Like

1r9rmuz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9rmuz,Dublin Airport posting volumes 7 + 8: Longest direct bus route from Dublin Airport and the oddity of gates 336/377,"Dublin Airport is served by 14 different bus operators excluding hotel shuttle services and car park shuttles which means your spoilt for choice when travelling to/from the airport (unlike Cork Airport which has a whopping 5 bus routes serving it from just two operators) but today I wanted to talk about Dublin Airports longest direct bus routes and there's many possible contenders so let's go through them shall we? although I should preface that before we start that some of these routes start from outside Dublin Airport so I will only be counting times from their departure from Dublin Airport rather than their departure from Dublin City or Elsewhere. to start off this list we got Expressway with their route 30 from Dublin to Donegal serving places like Dublin Airport, Cavan, Enniskillen, Ballyshannon and Donegal. this route takes about 3 hours and 45 minutes although Bus Eireann says 4 hours which makes this route a strong contender. next we got Aircoach with their 705x and Translink with their X3/X4 with all three of these routes going from Dublin City to Derry. first up we got the 705x by Aircoach which is the route that runs via Belfast city and Belfast International enroute to Derry (some terminate early at Belfast Grand Central but most run to Derry) with this route taking 4 hours and 15 minutes in total. next we got the X3 and X4 from Translink with the X3 running via Monaghan and the X4 running via Dungannon both on their way to Derry from Dublin City. the X3 takes about 3 hours and 20 minutes with the X4 taking the exact same amount of time so if your ever wondering on if you should take the X3 or X4 then you neednt worry as its purely preference based. another contender is Flightlinks route 722 from Dublin Airport to Killarney taking exactly 4 hours. but! all of these routes pale in comparison to Dublin Airports longest bus route which goes to John McGinley travels route 932 which goes all the way from Dublin through Dublin Airport then up North through towns like Ardee, Omagh, Lifford and then through Letterkenny where it goes on even further to Crolly and Annagry, this route takes a total of 4 hours and 45 minutes and can sometimes even take up to 5 hours in total! I have used this route once and I quite enjoyed it I must say despite its long length (although I sat on a 12 hour long Eurolines bus so 5 hours is nothing but that's a story for another time). anyways now we know that the longest route from Dublin Airport is the 932 to Annagry. 

Now lets go airside again for Dublin Airports oddest set of gates with Gates 336 and 337, most people don’t even know of these two gates which are used exclusively for Aer Lingus regional flights (sometimes very rarely other regional airlines use them but I rarely see it). going down the staircase or lift brings you to this room with some toilets (useful if all the other toilets are overcrowded since almost nobody ever goes here), the two gates, plenty of seating and a self serve coffee kiosk. as you can see only 7 flights are using these two gates today but something I found weird was despite the flight to Edinburgh boarding there was nobody there like not a single soul to found, its like this flight has zero passengers but they still have to operate the flight. anyways I hope I sparked your curiousity with this one and I recommend giving this part of Dublin Airport a try if your looking for some peace and Serenity, you can find it by going under the the esclators taking you down towards the gates and then going down the narrow corridors beside the esclators rather than going forward.",4,1771582541.0,ireland,5,0.83,False

1️⃣ Spine Shift (Static → Dynamic)
The first half applies the architecture metaphor to objects (living room, coffee table, career).
This is more static, decorative and controlled.
When the daughter is introduced, the metaphor becomes dynamic.
It expands into psychology, control, and morality.

Effect: The escalation increases intensity and gradually reveals the darker consequences of the narrator’s worldview.

2️⃣ Structural Mimicry (Form Mirrors Theme)
The paragraphs are short and stacked like bricks.

Effect: The structure visually reinforces the narrator’s obsession with rigidity and construction. Arguing with him feels like talking to a brick wall.

3️⃣ Hyperbolic Categorization
“Algebraic lion of sheer accuracy”

Effect: Combines math and predatory imagery to exaggerate competence into dominance. Creates absurd intensity while revealing obsession with control.

4️⃣ Assertive Worldview
Statements like:
“Emotion is weather.”
“Variables must be controlled.”
“Cold preserves.”
There is no doubt or hesitation.

Effect: The narrator sounds rational and confident, but the reader sees the emotional damage. This gap creates irony and unease.

1r9rkae,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1r9rkae/washington/,Washington,"To B:

In another life we’re together in Washington in a house that’s too small. The trees are so thick you can’t see the road from the front window. The wood stove never quite heats up the whole room, and it never stops raining. Books line the walls, there’s one picture of your dad on the mantle next to a pile of junk mail that never seems to leave. 

We sit across from each other on the couch, touching legs, the cats between us like always. Some show is on the TV you picked up secondhand because a new one would mean we can’t pay the mortgage that month. The speakers don’t sound quite right but I never pay attention to what’s on the screen anyways. 

We’re regulars at the diner across town because you love the knickknacks and i don’t hate the burnt coffee. The mechanic 3 houses down is the closest thing I have to a friend. One day I poked my head in his shop and now, 10 years later, we still share a few beers every Friday night. 

You reach to pull the blanket up further around your arms, pulling it off of me in the process. I know when I’m needed. I grab my flanel, the one your Mom gave me our second year together, walk out the back door and grab the axe. It’s only drizzling tonight, thank goodness. Before I reach the pile of wood I stop to look at my breath in the cold. 

In that moment, I think about the life I could have had if I left you. The career that was waiting for me. The friends I left behind. The chance to stay close to my parents. The other women that would have come after you. The thought lingers for a few more seconds than I want it to. 

My shoulder aches the older I get. I know the weather can’t be helping. I wish we managed to have kids but by the time I convinced you to let us try it was too late. Deep down I always knew it wasn’t what you wanted. You kept your own last name even after the marriage. 

As I gather up the firewood, I remind myself that I’m happy. That any life with you in it is the one I would want. That no amount of money or friends or hobbies could replace that special thing you and I have. That thing that, if you’re lucky, you really only find once in life.

But we’re not in Washington. And it’s been years since I’ve seen your smile. 

In another life I’m still happy with you. In another life, I let go of my dreams. In another life, I buried all my feelings of doubt and you ended up being enough. In another life we grow old along side each other. 

I’m happy now. I really hope you are too. I check in on you every once in a while through the screen, I know all your usernames by heart. I’m glad we never blocked each other. I watched the hatred for me leaving slowly disappear from your posts, I hope that means I’m on your mind less these days.  I have a new girlfriend, I love her and I think she may be the one. I heard you have a new boyfriend too, I hope he treats you well and cares for you. 

I still have all your letters. I still have our pictures saved on a hard dive I hide in my room. I still have the note you left on the table the day you moved out, I read it every so often. Sometimes, seeing you call me “my stinky” still gets a few tears out of me.  

This is my way of closing the chapter on us. I know we never got closure and I know it’s my fault for that. I didn’t know how to tell you I was choosing a different life. I saw the path you and I were on and I chose to change it. I know it hurt you more than anything else in life ever had up until then, and for that I am truly sorry. 

For me there will always be Washington. Not because we ever moved there, but because that’s the best way I can remember you and the life we almost had. The way things would have been if I had stayed. 

I hope love finds you again. You are a wonderful woman despite your many flaws and I am forever grateful that you loved me and all of my own. 

Yours, 

Stinky

A medium close-up, straight-on selfie shot features a young Thai woman with smooth, jet-black shoulder-length hair and light summer makeup, wearing a sleeveless top with soft, lightweight white fabric. She is positioned against a softly blurred background that suggests a modern indoor setting with hints of natural light streaming through a window, likely casting soft, diffused shadows on her face. Light reflections on the glass and faint digital interface elements, such as a floating heart icon and the word ""LIVE"" in capital letters, indicate that this is a livestream, likely occurring on the TikTok app, given a translucent watermark logo in the upper right. The color palette is warm and natural, with subtle olive greens and soft peach flesh tones. The image is captured on a smartphone front-facing camera, featuring high digital sharpness and moderate depth of field, with intermittent compression artifacts causing slight softening around hair edges and facial lines. The overall aesthetic is casual, intimate, and contemporary, suggesting a summery, candid atmosphere ideal for social content, accompanied by a welcoming and relaxed mood.

*Hi there, welcome! A little bit about me.*

Since moving away from Sydney and being a renter, I haven't had the luxury of filling up empty shelves with books collected from all over the world. I have however, fallen back in love with my trusty Kindle and libraries. My local library is Logan North and I was stoked to find a couple of books on display this week that sounded incredibly interesting! I mostly lean towards true crime, thrillers and Australian feminist writing, and reading at the beach is one of my favourite things to do in my downtime. Give me a coffee and I'm all set! 

Last year, I made more of an effort to spend less time on my devices and more time stuck in a novel. I found myself expanding my horizons, learning new things and relaxing without having to spend very much.

1r9redq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9redq,India needs more citizens to dominate the server in WarEra. We are building a Superpower and need YOU.,"Heyo everyone, we are trying to get the Indian community in [WarEra.io](http://WarEra.io), a geopolitical strategy MMO where players run countries, economies, and armies. ​Rn, the server is evolving fast. Other countries are forming massive alliances, establishing distinct economies, and taking territory. India has massive potential in-game due to our numbers, but we need more active citizens to actually become a global superpower.

This is NOT a promotion of the game, it's not Pay-to-Win. As you all can see in the image, we are not even top 10 in terms of active population many small/low population countries have more players than us.

WarEra is a browser-based (and mobile app) geopolitical simulator (maybe RTS too). It’s not a graphics-heavy shooter, it’s about Strategy, Politics, and Economy. It's a simplified, community driven and played in real-time with hundreds of other people.

​Real Politics: We have our own elections. You can run for President, become a minister of Defense, or manage the country's tax rates or even pass laws as a member of Parliament. ​War & Territory: We defend our real-world borders and can expand into neighboring regions. (Yes, we can conquer. Yes, it is satisfying. Yes, we've made Akhand Bharat.) ​Economy: Build factories, trade resources on the global market, and supply our soldiers with weapons and food, tip or make news articles and manipulate market with fake news. ​NO Pay-to-Win: This is the best part. You cannot buy your way to victory. Strategy and activity win wars, not UPI. Only IAPs are profile decorations.

And the best part, it can take 10 minutes a day. You log in, train, work at a factory, vote, maybe fight in a battle if one is active, and you're done. It’s the perfect ""coffee break"" game. But if you want intense debates, join the politics and fight all you want by words.

​We need people who want to: ​Soldiers: Just log in and click ""Fight"" to defend our borders. ​Economists: Players who enjoy market trading and supplying the army. ​Politicians: People who want to organize the community, create laws, and handle diplomacy with other countries. ​ How to join: ​Go to [www.warera.io](http://www.warera.io/) (You can also google search) ​Select India as your citizenship. ​Important: Join the Discord (link inside the game). That is where the real planning, alliance talks, and strategies happen.

​Let’s show the server the strength of the Indian community. See you in the game! 🇮🇳

Prep week: -3.4

So as you can see, I've already lost a tiny bit. But for whatever reason, today feels like I am standing at ground zero for something monumental. I hope it is true. I'm not sure if this is true for anyone else, but I personally felt the need to prepare for this journey. Here are some of the things that I have done that have helped me feel ready to undertake this task. 

* I downloaded a tracking app - I hate tracking my food under the best of circumstances, but it has helped me discover a lot about my eating habits and be mindful of where I'm at for the day. I have found (as mentioned in my last post) that I'm not so much an over-eater as a bad eater. I rarely, if ever, consume enough protein. I eat way too much pasta. And I normally skip both breakfast and lunch and live off of my overcreamered coffee until late in the day and then dive into dinner like a starving person. Then once I have broken my fast, out come the late-night snacks.
* Cut soda, even sugar-free - I don't really miss it. And I'm a lot less bloated and gassy without it. No more drinking my calories for the win.
* Reduced coffee - for similar reasons as above. I don't need to be drinking my calories and I wanted to reduce any chance of caffeine-related side effects.
* Downloaded a weight app - a simple tracker, separate from my food tracker app, though there is one on there too. This one allows me to not only create an overall profile for myself but set mini goals that don't feel as overwhelming as losing 220lbs does.
* Grocery shopped - Now that I am more aware of my eating habits in addition to researching side effects, I have purchased small things to eat throughout the day to make sure that I am hitting a calorie minimum and meeting my protein and fiber goals. For example - greek yogurt, apples and peanut butter, tuna and crackers, avocados, crack an eggs (microwaveable just add an egg scramble bowl), Liquid IV, as well as a decent protein powder to drink in the mornings with my meds. It has amazed me how much I have programmed my mind over the years to think diet. To tell myself I can't have this (keto) or I can't have that. Part of this journey for me is about long-term eating and changing my relationship with food.

I feel ready, in that first day of the rest of my life kind of way. My first goal is to get under 350. I'll update again next week with how I'm doing on the meds and my stats. To all of you on your own journeys, I wish you all monumental success.",1,1771581364.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False

I wanted to create a space where inspiration isn’t fleeting. In a world moving faster every day, filled with noise and constant scrolling, I wanted something that makes you slow down. Spark Archive is 230 pages of carefully curated photography, design, and artwork — somewhere between a coffee table book and an art magazine. It’s a collector’s piece that celebrates creativity, beauty, and the quiet power of ideas.

Each issue features 16 deeply individual articles with emerging talents and established creatives from all over the world. The goal isn’t just to show art — it’s to create a place where anyone can find a spark of inspiration, no matter who they are or where they come from.

We’re currently **78% funded on Kickstarter**, and we’re so close to printing the first issue. Holding the prototype in my hands was surreal — I could finally see months of work come alive. Now, it just needs a little push to reach the finish line.

If you love discovering new ideas, slowing down, or simply being inspired by beautiful visuals, check it out here: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spark-magazine/spark-magazine](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spark-magazine/spark-magazine)

Even if you don’t back it, I’d love for people to see it, share it, or just experience the stories inside. Thanks for taking the time to read this — I hope it sparks something for you.

Easily manufactured light armour that stops up to 50% of light penetration rounds from entering the vehicle cabin.

Easily manufactured spring suspension that will cause complete inversion of the vehicle when encountering craters, bushes, small rocks, corpses or Super Samples far less than one would reasonably expect.

Easily repurposed engine taken from the Bastion Tank Destroyer, which has been under utilised in the last campaign, making the Rumble alarmingly responsive and unpredictably agile.

Drops from the Pelican with a full set of supplies mounted on the back and an Entrenching Shovel for each Diver stowed under the sturdy seats made from repurposed Helldiver capes.

Most impressively the Rumble can enter not one but TWO auxiliary modes - Firstly, it can deploy as a small but perfectly functioning camp kitchen, allowing Divers to enjoy a brief but refreshing mug of Synth-Caf, the Federations favourite immitation coffee.

Secondly, engaging the OVERDRIVE function will propel the Rumble and their courageous driver at the enemies of Democracy with all the speed and explosive force the remainder of the fuel reserves can supply.

So don't be disheartened by our slow, gruelling Death March across the frozen wastes of Cyberstan. Call down the Rumble, take a big gulp of that Synth-Caf and get ready to deliver barely controllable, screaming Liberty to the enemy! 🫡",17,1771581027.0,LowSodiumHellDivers,2,1.0,False

Long story.","I wrote the following on several breakup / alcohol related subreddits, but I spoke to a psychologist in the meantime and while describing her behavior he said it sounds like BPD.

What I didn't write there is something I think is relevant to her having BPD. The very first date, she basically demanded to have sex with her. We went for drinks, after which I asked what she wants to do now. She said ""take me home"" as in the night is over. I was driving her home when she became upset ""what are you doing? you're really driving me home!?"" I said ""that's what you said, what?"" she said ""I want you to be a man and take what you want"". It ended with us in the parking lot in front of her apartment where her ex lives and she said ""do what you have to quickly"" and took her pants off. If it wasn't for the fact that I just bought a new car and though ""wow, the car is already paying off"", I would have been more suspicious. She grabbed her box of condoms and smirkingly said ""look, one is missing, ask yourself..."".

Later she told me I was her 4th that month but that prior to that she was in a 10 year relationship where she didn't cheat, except the very first year, and only by kissing others. Said she needed to get back into the game after a long relationship. She also hesitated to see me saying I am too nice, too normal for her and that she has to work on herself a lot.

If you would indulge me, please read this wild ride of a story and see if it makes sense:

We were together for 10 months. During that time I kept noticing she gets blackout drunk when she drinks. Not to the point of passing out, but to the point of completely having altered personality and no memory of anything the next day. At first I chucked it off to her having recently started drinking again after 10 years of abstinence, because 10 years prior shit hit the fan with her drinking habits (late teens, early 20s). She thought she can drink safely and moderately now. So after 10 years of sobriety, I figured she doesn't know her limit. Plus it was summer, so I chucked it off to summer vibe.

But over time a pattern was noticeable. She would change moods in a heartbeat. She would go from angry to horny and back. It was impossible to keep up. She would become mean and insult me. For example, if she became horny but all I could see was a drunk woman and didn't feel like having sex, she would get mad, leave the house, throw some tantrums, threaten that there are guys who will if I wont, etc. She would also pick fights out of nowhere.

I started telling her when sober ""I don't like it when you drink, you become someone else, I would prefer if you didn't drink like you didn't for 10 years"". She would agree that its a waste of whole day being hungover and would apologize for being mean, but claimed she has no recollection of that. These kinds of fights were becoming often.

I can't even remember all those kinds of events. It became something predictable to me. I became almost immune to those fights, I was just going through the motions ""ok now she's leaving...ok now she's back...now she's yelling, now she's insulting my friends, now she's dancing and asking me to have sex...."". I started to lose patience so I would sometimes try to nip that in the bud by being rude myself. Other times I would just read a book while she's having a meltdown.

One major event happened on a friend's birthday party (same friend from before). In a group of 10 people, where she only knows 2, she was the only one to get drunk. She got so drunk, her head was just hanging above the plate on the table and she couldn't talk. When we left I scolded her saying ""you embarrassed yourself and me. This is the first impression you are leaving for those people"" etc. We got into a huge fight with her classic exiting and entering the house, insulting, etc. I just tried to go to bed but she was relentless. At one point I yelled ""get in or get out, just leave me alone"" and she started hugging me and crying saying ""I won't leave you alone"".

The next day and over the course of some time I kept telling her I've had enough. I do not have it in me to live another one of those scenes. If she has another drink, I am gone.

She said ""you cannot expect me never to have another drink, not even for cheers at some events."" and said I am pressuring her. Said it would be better to just leave her next time she does it than to announce it like this. Said that she can drink moderately and she will never repeat those kinds of scenes again. I said I don't believe she can drink moderately and I won't risk it. If she has another drop, I'm gone.

About a month later we went to another couple because they are inviting us to their wedding and she never met them before. They offered some drinks, she chose wine. I watched her drink 4 glasses by the time I had one glass of beer. I started pointing it out to her that she needs to slow down and mind her drinking. She did not like that. She ended up getting drunk there.

On the way home I started saying ""you did it again. what did I say will happen if you do it again? do you want to break up? do you just want to push me to do it?""

She just started dancing drunkenly in the car, insulting my friends, telling me to shut up, etc. When she got mean, and knowing what's in store for me for the rest of the evening, the words ""that's it. we're done, you will take your stuff and go home tonight"" just came out of me.

She started slamming the doors, throwing stuff around the house, started saying some guy will pick her up. When I said ""I am taking you home right now"" she said ""I will leave when I feel like it"".

At that moment I just saw my entire evening in a glimpse and decided I will not live out another one of those endless traumatic scenes. I took my phone out and dialed 911. Told them ""I have a weird situation. My ex refuses to leave my house"". When she heard I'm serious, she started hitting me and kicking me. I told the cops ""as we speak, she is hitting me, hurry up"". After I hung up, she continued to kick me. I forcibly took her out of the house and locked the doors.

Then she started slamming on the doors with her hands and feet and endlessly ringing the doorbell. She did not say a word, she was a zombie. She was just kicking the doors for like 10 minutes. At that point I knew there's no going back. The whole neighborhood is witnessing this. I started recording it for police and to share it with some people to keep me in check. There is no more ignoring this. We are not going to forget about this in the morning like always. This time there will be consequences.

Then she left and stopped the first car that drove by. It was accidentally a guy I know, but she doesn't. She asked him to drive her home. During the trip she even accused him of ""wanting to fuck her"" which I'm afraid was more of an invitation than anything. Like I said, she gets extremely horny drunk and from the stories she told me about that 10+ years earlier, many people were happy about her drinking.

Then she came back to my house and started endlessly ringing the doorbell again. Then the cops showed up and handcuffed her and took her to the station where she spent the night. I did not intend on her spending the night in jail. I thought cops will come and she will fear the authority and leave, but because they have it on recording that she hit me, it had to be jail.

The next day she called me and cried and apologized and all that. I told her it's the end, I cannot save her. I took all her stuff back to her apartment so there is nothing for her to come back for.

We met a few days later out of my weakness. She said she is done with alcohol for life, that this was a wakeup call she needed, that she will change her ways, that she is ready for a life in line with her age, that she wants to be clean, focused, have a family, etc. I said I don't think she'll change. She tried once 10 years ago and again slipped. Next stressful moment will reset her habits again, I cannot risk it. We both cried and I told her she needs to give up on me.

And after all this, I am still second guessing myself, wondering if I can give her another chance, maybe she will get her act together after this.

Even without alcohol she was picking stupid fights, kept the house a mess, showed no real capability for responsibility, etc. We fought daily. All my friends hate her now and do not want me to entertain the idea of getting back to her for one second. I have a hard time dealing with her promiscuous past, mostly alcohol driven.

But on the other hand, when things were great she was a sweetheart. I never doubted her love for me, that she is dedicated to me, that she prioritizes me. I felt loved and I loved her. She's extremely funny and we could talk about anything. I loved just going for coffee with her. The fights she would pick could also be quickly resolved.

I wonder if I didn't have the right approach, didn't support her in the way she needed. I miss her.",1,1771580921.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

I (F23) have this high school batchmate (M23–24). We were never close, but we knew each other back then. We danced at our Grade 10 prom, and although he wasn’t my crush, I found him attractive because he always looked neat and mabango.

After that, we barely interacted—just occasional social media likes.

Fast forward to college: I transferred schools for my 3rd–4th year, and it turns out he’s enrolled there too. We’d randomly pass each other in the hallway—just eyebrow raises as a silent hi. During graduation practice, he held the door open for me at a coffee shop (just courtesy, I think). Nothing flirty, just small, harmless moments.

This year, I posted my freediving videos on my story. He messaged me asking about the details (he’s into traveling, so I’m not assuming anything). Then in February, we randomly bumped into each other at a stoplight near a printing shop. We did the usual “uy ikaw pala,” small talk, and then went our separate ways.

For context, I have a boyfriend of 5 years. I’m not kilig or anything. I just find it weird and kind of cute how our encounters feel like they’re happening one after another lately.

1r9quhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r9quhk/my_town_is_haunted_by_a_witch_if_she_knocks_on/,"My town is haunted by a witch. If she knocks on your door, you must let her in.","I live in an old New England town. Legend has it that for 300 years, it has been haunted by Zuriel the Witch. 

We learn about Zuriel on school grounds.

Older kids teach the younger, voices low and eyes glimmering: she will knock on your door in the form of a traveller asking for a glass of water. You will know it’s her because despite claiming that she is terribly thirsty, she will not touch the water you offer her. 

There are five rules you must follow when Zuriel knocks on your door. 

1. *You must let her in.*
2. *You must be friendly at all times.*
3. *You must not show that you are afraid of her.*
4. *You must not let her out of your sight.*
5. *You must not let her past the first room of your house.* 

When someone dies in a domestic accident, whispers circulate that they received a visit from Zuriel and didn’t follow the rules. Some claim to have met her and survived, but because she changes appearance every time, accounts are impossible to verify.

Many grownups would deny believing in Zuriel, but when entering a house in our town, one will usually find a glass and bottle of water kept by the front door - just in case a stranger stops by.

I am a skeptic. Or rather, I used to be until recently. 

Sure, Zuriel scared me as a child. When I heard someone knocking at my parents’ door, I would run to my room and lock myself in. Zuriel never came.

As I got older, I did my research on her.

It turns out that a woman by the name of Zuriel really lived in our town: according to historical records, she was a “maiden of most ill-favoured countenance” who lived alone at the edge of the woods. Long suspected of being “troubled by an unclean spirit”, she was much disliked by the townsfolk. They complained that she “continually intruded upon their property”. 

In 1734, after Zuriel had not been seen for weeks, a pious old woman went to check on her: she found Zuriel’s decomposing body lying in her shed - her throat cut almost to the bone. Although some young men had been heard declaring they would “rid the town of the foul witch”, they were never prosecuted.

This haunting nonsense was the result of a sad page of History, I concluded. 

After I married and moved into a new house with my husband, he insisted on keeping a glass and a bottle of water by the front door. I did not want to, but I figured it wasn’t a matter worth fighting over.

Last Friday, at around 3pm, I had just put my son down for a nap when I heard knocking at the door. I absentmindedly opened the door to a woman of about forty whom I had never seen before. She was in hiking clothes. Not surprising - the area is known for its nature trails. 

“Hi, can I help you?”

“Hi, I’m so sorry to bother you - “

A stylish bob encircled her pleasant face. Even with sweat pearling on her forehead, she looked polished. I thought she must have come from a big city. 

“ - may I ask you for a glass of water? My bottle is empty and I am so very thirsty.”

She smiled at me apologetically.

A hiker asking for a glass of water. That’s it.

*You must let her in.*

“Of course. Please, come in.”

“Oh, that’s so kind of you. Are you sure I am not bothering you?”

“No bother at all.”

She bashfully walked through the door I held open for her.

A split-second thought crossed my mind: slam the door in her face!

I didn’t, of course. In the blink of an eye, the hiker was inside my house. 

She hovered by the entrance politely.

I turned towards the kitchen, then remembered the glass and water bottle sitting right next to me. 

*You must not let her out of your sight.*

Well, why not.

As I poured the water, she glided from the entrance to the couch and sat down. I did not like that. She must have noticed, because a flicker of guilt tightened her features.

*You must be friendly at all times.*

I responded with a bright smile, handing her the glass. That’s when I noticed that she had no backpack. No pouch. Not even a water bottle. 

I took a deep breath to push down the panic that had started swelling up. I sat in front of her.

“You’ve been hiking?”, I chirped. 

“I just did the mountain loop,” she replied enthusiastically, “It was so pretty!”

Without drinking any of it, she set the glass on her lap.

“It’s one of my favorites,” I responded.

Her fingers gripped the glass. She didn’t drink it. 

“And it’s such a nice day today”, I continued. 

“It was lovely. Almost too hot.”

Her face beamed with sweat. A drop rolled from her forehead to her chin. It fell into her lap. She still did not drink. 

My eyes snapped up to her: she was staring at me staring at her. 

*You must be friendly at all times.*

I laughed a horrendous laugh: “Yeah, I love it when it’s hot.”

She laughed along. Inside me, the adult woman disappeared, and I became that little girl who wanted to lock herself in her room again.

“Have you been in the area before?” I asked, forcing my voice to sound even.

“It’s my first time visiting,” she responded cheerfully. “Have you been living here long?”

“I was born here,” I said. Then, fearing I was lacking in amiability, I exclaimed, ”Wouldn’t want to live anywhere else!”

“Of course. Such a lovely place. And everyone seems so nice.”

Her gaze shifted to a framed photo of me, my husband and my son.

“What a cutie…” she whispered, narrowing her eyes. 

Revulsion twisted my stomach. Smash the frame in her face!, I thought. I didn’t, of course. I sat perfectly still and pushed out a timid “Thank you.”

She turned to me with a proud smile: “You know, I have a son the same age. He’s with his dad now. Unfortunately we’re divorced, but we maintain a good friendship. That’s so important for a child.”

“Oh! Yeah, so important…” I stammered, taken aback.

She stood up, leaving the glass on the coffee table. “Well, so sorry for bothering you. I’ll be on my way before it gets dark.”

A wave of relief rushed through me. “Of course, no bother at all.”

She trotted to the front door. I had to stifle a laugh: awoken from a bad dream, I was back in the land of the living. “Hope you enjoy the rest of your trip!”

Her hand pushed down the door handle, then let it back up. “One last thing,” she said, “may I use your restroom?”

Cold dread enveloped me before her words even reached my brain.

*You must not let her past the first room of your house.* 

“I’m sorry but- the restroom is out of order.”

“Is that so?” she asked, as she breezed right back to the seat in front of me. “Why?”

My pulse went wild.

“It’s clogged. We’ve had an awkward accident earlier.” I cackled.

She winked. “Whoops! I can have a look if you’d like. I’m pretty savvy with small repairs.”

“Oh no, you don’t have to. There’s a public restroom right across the street, in the park.”

I pointed at the window. My hand trembled: it was already dark outside. That was impossible. Sunset was supposed to be hours away, and she hadn’t been in my house for more than a few minutes. 

“I would love to repay your hospitality,” she insisted, eyes wide and eager.

“My husband is about to come home from work. He will do it. You know men - “ I leaned towards her, displaying the most conniving smile I could muster “They like to feel useful.“

She played along. “I get it. Since my husband left, I've had to learn to do it all by myself.”

“I admire your independence.” 

“Thank you for saying that. It means a lot.”

She seemed genuinely flattered. I was not doing too bad, I thought. 

A piercing cry arose from upstairs.

“Mooommyyyyy!!”

My son had woken up. He is an anxious baby - at two years old, he has only just started to sleep on his own. Whenever he wakes up and doesn’t find us, he goes into a panic. 

I almost shot from my seat, but managed to reel myself back in.

“Don’t you want to go to him?”, she asked me gently.

*You must not let her out of your sight.*

“That’s okay. He needs to get used to it.”

“Moooooommyyyyy!!!!”

He had a way of sounding like something absolutely terrible was happening. Which it was.

“MOOOOOMMMYYYYY-”

His voice broke. But he kept on screaming. What if he was actually hurt? 

She sat perfectly still, grinning at me. 

“Are you sure he’s okay?” Her question sounded somewhat like a threat. 

*You must not let her out of your sight.*

I nodded vigorously: “We’re training him to sleep on his own.” 

Listening to the pleas of my hurting baby was near-unbearable. I reminded myself of all the people - all the children - who had died in tragic circumstances: he broke his neck tripping down the stairs … she choked on her food… the little one drank from a bottle of bleach … “They were visited by Zuriel,” the rumors always said, “And they didn’t follow the rules.”

“I’ve never seen a mother like you,” she said.

I ignored the provocation. “How about your little one?” I had to raise my voice over my son’s cries. “Does he sleep on his own?” 

She lit up at the mention of her child. “He sleeps like an angel. My daughter, on the other hand, is like yours. She wanted to be held all the time.”

“You have a daughter, too?”

“Yes, I do,” she snapped, as if I was doubting her.

My son abruptly went silent. That alarmed me even more: why did he stop? I furiously wanted to go check on him.

“See?” I said instead, “He calmed down.”

“You’re a very interesting woman,” she responded, and shuffled forward. Her knees almost touched mine. “I’m really enjoying getting to know you.”

I did not budge, swallowing my disgust. “Me too. It’s nice to see a new face around here. Maybe… “ I jumped into the abyss. “... maybe we could be friends.”

Her eyebrows shot up, her eyes widened, her lips parted.

“I would love that,”she breathed. A rush of emotion flushed her cheeks. A web of red veins flared beneath her skin, then began to swell, morphing into elongated red warts.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“What- what do you - what did you think of the hike?”, I spluttered, desperate to fill the silence.

“It was amazingly lovely,” she trilled, while one of her eyes turned gray. “What else do you suggest I do in the area?”

I held on to that question like a life raft. “If you love nature, I would recommend the national wildlife refuge and paddleboarding on the river -” 

Her hair vanished one by one, leaving only a few dishevelled clumps on a bald head.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“ - a walk downtown is great for shopping. Aunt Rita’s Kitchen serves the best clam chowder in town - “

Her teeth blackened. Strands of yellow saliva stretched between the upper and lower arcade. 

I waged war against every one of my muscles to not look away.

“- for culture lovers, the local museum has great artifacts - “

One side of her face went moldy. A worm wriggled out of her ear and slid inside her eyesocket.

I smiled hard.

“ - and let’s not forget the Civil War battleground - “

A slit appeared on her throat, from side to side. Dark blood came pouring out, inundating her clothes, my couch, my carpet. Her head fell backwards - the wound was spread apart like two halves of a steak, exposing her sliced-off windpipe. Only a thin layer of skin kept the head from rolling away. Yet, from an absurd angle, her one eye was still set on me.

My smile did not falter.

“ - you can always catch a performance at the Arts Center - “

The lights flickered. 

“ - my personal favorites are the dance shows - “

All the lights went out with a pop, except the overhead light. It flickered desperately.

The thought of being alone in the dark with her was so terrifying my heart nearly stopped. 

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

I thought about my son sleeping peacefully in his crib. The sun rising on the ocean. A fluffy kitten drinking from a bowl of milk.

“ - for drinks there’s a little bar by the river - “

The lights went out.

I opened my mouth to scream. 

In the blink of an eye, the lights came back on. 

I sucked in the scream before it could ring out.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

She looked like a preppy forty-year-old lady hiker again. No sign of a neck wound. Her clothes were clean, so were my couch and carpet. Outside, the day was bright again. 

I allowed myself a breath of relief. Maybe this was it. I passed the test. She would be gone now.

“Thank you for that,” she said softly. “Since there’s so much to do around here, maybe I should stay a few more days.”

My throat tightened. “What a great idea.”

“Hmmm…” She looked around the room, pensively. “Do you have a guest room? I would love to stay if you’ll have me.”

Despair hooked its fingers into my insides. 

“We don’t have a guest room unfortunately. I would have loved to have you stay with us.”

“That’s a shame. What if I slept on the couch?”

“I would not want you to be uncomfortable.”

“I don’t need much. This looks perfectly comfortable.”

“My son is a rambunctious kid - .”

“So? Didn’t I tell you I am a mom too?”

“Yes -”

“You don’t believe me?”

“Yes, of course -”

I was losing ground, and I felt my energy leaving me. 

“It almost sounds like you’re making up excuses not to have me. Didn’t you say you wanted to be friends?”

“Yes, of course -”

“Mommy…”

I had not heard him come in. My son was standing in the doorframe. He clutched his teddy bear, chubby cheeks streaked with dried up tears. 

She looked just as startled as I was.

“He must have climbed out of his toddler bed,” I said, forcing cheerfulness. I held out my arms to him. “Honey, come here!” 

Instead, he directed his unsteady little feet towards her.

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“Hello, little man!” she exclaimed, baring her teeth at him.

I was now trembling from head to toe. 

She stretched out her hand and wiggled her long-nailed fingers.

My son wobbled closer to her.

I wanted to scream, yank him away from her, run - but because I didn’t know what the right thing to do was, I sat still - paralyzed. 

*You must not show that you are afraid of her.*

“Would you like me to stay here with you?” she said in a cringe-worthy baby voice. 

“No! No! Say no!” I yelled inside my head. 

My son gave her a toothless smile. That smile of pure delight only little children are capable of. She widened her grin. Pushed her demonic hand further towards him.

The room around me started shaking. Every nerve in my body twisted. 

My son put his teddy bear in her outstretched hand - like a friendship offering. 

Time stopped. 

Her mouth trembled, smile morphing into a sorrowful grimace. 

She gripped the teddy bear and brought it to her heart… Finally, she let out a long, painful breath.

“I am sure your child wants his mommy to himself,” she finally murmured. “I’ll be on my way.”

She slowly rose and set the teddy bear on the couch.

“It was great to have-”

“Thank you for your kindness.” 

She ever so lightly stroked my hand with her fingers. And then, just as swiftly as she came, she was gone.

It’s been seven days since she visited. I’ve been watching my husband and son like a hawk, expecting them to trip, fall, get burned or some other terrible thing. No one got hurt. 

Life is beginning to feel normal again.

Some people inspire disgust instantly—before they’ve even spoken a word. You see them for the first time, and something inside you curdles. An irrational hatred rises, hot and immediate.

She appeared in our office without warning. In the middle of the workday, our director stepped out of his office and introduced a thin, gray-haired woman of about sixty as his new deputy. I glanced up from my monitor, looked at her once—and knew nothing good would come of it.

There was something about her—her oversized nose, horse-like teeth, dull, lifeless eyes—that triggered a visceral revulsion. Instinctive. Animal.

It didn’t take long to confirm that her personality matched her appearance. From the very first days, she showed her true colors and quickly made the entire office despise her. Not only was she incompetent, she barely knew how to use a computer or basic office equipment. But since the work still had to get done, she simply pushed her responsibilities onto the rest of us.

All day long, Margaret drifted through the office pretending to be busy—handing out pointless assignments or hovering over anyone she thought “wasn’t doing enough.”

Predictably, no one liked that. Arguments became routine. Some employees shouted at her openly. Others stormed into the director’s office, and the yelling behind closed doors made the whole floor tremble. None of it mattered. The director would come out shrugging, and nothing ever changed.

Coffee breaks and lunches turned into a hate club dedicated to Margaret Wilson. We dissected everything: her absurd orders, her appearance, her shrill voice, her stiff haircut, the suffocating cloud of perfume she left behind. With the number of curses thrown her way, she should have dropped dead long ago—if words carried any weight.

I didn’t participate.

What’s the point? If you’re not going to act, your words are empty. And if you are going to act—it’s better to stay silent.

I never argued with her either. Whatever she said, whatever she demanded—I smiled and complied. Inside, rage shook me like a fever. On the outside, I was the model employee.

I waited.

I didn’t have a plan. But I felt certain that sooner or later, an opportunity would present itself.

And it did.

On Fridays, the office emptied quickly. The workday wasn’t officially shorter, but people slipped out early anyway. The director left first. Accounting followed. By six o’clock, no one remained except Margaret, who made a point of leaving precisely at six.

That Friday, I stayed later than usual. A project was due Monday, and I wanted to finish part of it before going home.

Our office occupies the third floor of a new business center that’s still mostly vacant. A few other companies rent space, but some are still moving in, others close early. That evening, besides Margaret and me, the building was empty—except for the security guard downstairs.

At six sharp, she shut down her computer, grabbed her purse, gave me a curt nod, and walked toward the elevator.

That was when the lights went out.

The building fell into darkness.

I stood up and stepped into the hallway. I had no plan. I moved on instinct alone.

I knew she wouldn’t wait for the power to return. She wouldn’t risk the elevator. She’d take the stairs.

So I followed—quietly. Like a predator trailing prey.

I caught up with her at the stairwell. She had just stepped onto the first stair when she heard my footsteps and began to turn.

That’s when I pushed her.

Hard. Precise.

She didn’t scream. Not even a gasp. Only the heavy thuds of her body striking the steps echoed through the darkness, like a sack of potatoes tumbling down.

In that moment, I felt no regret. No guilt. Not even fear of being caught. What boiled inside me was something else entirely—a raw, almost sweet exhilaration. A euphoric surge so intense my ears rang and my vision blurred.

It took several minutes before I could breathe normally again.

Finally, I descended the stairs, lighting my way with my phone.

One glance was enough. She hadn’t survived. From a distance, her body looked like a broken doll, limbs twisted at unnatural angles. Still, I had to be sure. Carefully—making certain to leave no traces—I checked for a pulse.

Nothing.

I returned to the office, sat at my desk, and scrolled through my phone while waiting for the power to come back.

It did ten minutes later.

Fifteen minutes after that, a scream rose from downstairs. The cameras had reactivated. The guard had seen the body.

I hurried down wearing a suitably shocked expression. We examined the corpse together and waited for the ambulance.

It arrived quickly. The police followed.

They examined the scene for hours, collected security footage—though there was nothing useful recorded during the blackout—and questioned us both. Before long, it became clear they were leaning toward an accident.

I got home after midnight.

Despite the exhaustion, I felt wonderful. I’d gotten away with it again.

Just like when I was twelve.

They found my classmate’s body behind the garages in our neighborhood. He’d been smoking late at night when someone crept up and crushed his skull with a piece of rebar. My mother cried for days. She had sent me out to the grocery store that evening.

“What if it had been you?” she kept saying.

I could barely hold back my laughter.

She never knew that the “mysterious killer” had been me.

Then, as now, no one suspected a thing.

A month passed.

They called me in for questioning a few more times, but it was procedural. Officially, the case was ruled an accident and closed.

The office atmosphere improved noticeably after her death. Work became easier. But to my surprise, my coworkers reacted differently than I expected. I hadn’t anticipated open celebration—but listening to those same people who had mocked her behind her back now call her “a good person” and say she “cared deeply about the company” made me sick.

No one suspected me. Everyone knew I’d never argued with her. There were no sideways glances. No whispers behind my back.

And I certainly wasn’t going to correct them.

But after solving one problem at work, I unexpectedly gained another—this time in the form of my new neighbor.

A woman recently moved into the apartment across the hall.

Loud. Argumentative.

I hated her at first sight.

Some people inspire disgust immediately—simply by existing. You see them for the first time, they haven’t even spoken yet, and already you despise them… without knowing why.",4,1771579646.0,libraryofshadows,2,1.0,False

As a DM for our weekly online game, I always have a ton of tabs open. Especially to look up conditions and spells and things, so I decided to have a crack at making a browser extension that could live on top of any open tab (for example, we use AboveVTT as our online VTT, and this works on top of that...), and with the press of a shortcut (**Shift + Ctrl + Space** is the default shortcut, but it can be changed in the settings tab...) an overlay slides out from the left side. And it evolved into the DM Companion, and I'm quite happy with how it came out! I published it to the Chrome Extension store, and it's free if you guys wanna try it out.

Here's what it does so far (I'm open for suggestions, feedback or feature requests!):

1. Keep track of basic player stats (class, level, attribute scores, passive perception, AC, max HP etc)
2. Combat stuff - quickly lookup things like conditions, actions you can take, weapon masteries, etc
3. Spells - look up spells and filter by class and/or level - all spells from the SRD
4. Items and Gear - look up all weapons, armor, adventuring gear descriptions, prices, weights
5. Skills - quickly look up skills and the tools & kits info
6. Random Name Generator - select species and gender and it gives you 10 random names, which you can save to a list, or easily copy to the clipboard
7. Basic note taking - take some notes right in the tool.

All the info comes from the SRD, and thankfully there's an amazing guy (Seth Henderson) who turned the whole SRD 5.2 from the PDF into a markdown version so grabbing the data from that made it much easier!

It lives totally offline on your pc, I don't capture any of your data. You can export the data and import it into another computer if you want.

I did put a ""buy me a coffee"" link for tips, but again the tool functions 100% for free.

I always need to look up grappling rules haha, and the weapon masteries... What are you guys always looking up, and if it's not in the tool I'll make a note to add them for the next version :)

Anw, one day i went to the arcades in 1992 and noticed it was packed, mostly with much older kids and men, they were all around 1 arcade machine, i took me a miracle just to get near it and saw it, it was a fighting game with real people in it, like a better version of PIT FIGHTERS and i noticed the blood, the amazing blood in it, it was so gory and i was laughing until i saw what a player with subzero did to another guy when something called ''FINISH HIM'' came up on the screen and i was like jaw dropped.

Went back home and told my brother and cousins, and we went back, we want to see more, and even play it, but of course, no dice, took us a long time, several weeks honestly to get a turn on it.

I think the time i laughed the most was the first time i played, we both picked sub-zero so that the winner can do that awesome fatality, stupid us thought all we needed to do a fatality with subzero is to simply uppercut the other guy when ''finish him'' came up...boy were we wrong.

I was so happy the next year, end of 1993, that the game came home, i had an snes and my cousins were genesis, i was 13 so i went in and bought the snes and genesis version because i was deemed old enough to buy them (arcades were also for 12 and up, but we would sneak in regulary).

So many wonderful stories about the home ports, but best of them was that i was the only one who heard of D U L L A R D code, and i didn't tell anyone about it, so i had leverage when we played the genesis version, thinking about it, i feel bad that my cousins would play the censored version all the time and had to wait for me to come visit to activate the blood code.

I remember one sunday morning, my uncle came to visit us, he usually brings brekfast, they grown ups sit in the kitchen and eat, talk, coffee, smoke, while me and my brother would sit in the living room, eating and watching cartoons and i heard my uncle saying to my dad ''Your son got my kids this horrible video game, it is so violent and disgusting, yesterday i walked in on my boy and saw him playing a game where he ripped off the head of the oppenent with his bare hands and held it up high with his spinal cord dangling and blood everywhere, your kid got them this god forsaken game''.

i must say, that day didn't go too well.

My snes version on the other hand, while looking amazing, the lack of blood was a bummer, but i have to admit, the fatalities of raiden and subzero were cool even when censored and no one can deny, the snes graphics were so much better than the genesis and we used to say if only the genesis version looked and sounded as good as the snes and they kept the blood and the faster paced action, it would be amazing.

Now, i have to end this and i will see you next week with my story about the sequel.",12,1771579208.0,retrogaming,0,1.0,False

Honestly, after creating multiple products and seeing nothing happen, I was almost hopeless.

You build something. You price it. You publish it. And then… silence.

I started thinking maybe digital products are not for me.

Then I created two simple things:

* A [**Blog Sponsorship Bundle**](https://inuetc.gumroad.com/l/BlogSponsorshipBundle)
* A [**Reverse Engineering Guide**](https://inuetc.gumroad.com/l/buildandsell)

Nothing fancy. Just simple, actionable, useful.

And then one day… I made a sale on Gumroad.

It was just $7.

But I was so happy I screamed and told my cousin immediately.

**The biggest shift wasn’t the money. It was the belief that this could work.**

It was proof that someone, somewhere, saw value in something I created and decided to pay for it.

Recently, I made a $9 sale on another guide. Then another one for $19 because someone used a $10 off coupon on the [Blog Sponsorship Bundle.](https://inuetc.gumroad.com/l/BlogSponsorshipBundle)

Small numbers?

Yes.

But a huge confidence boost.

Recently, I launched [**Inuidea Hunt**](https://inuidea.com/hunt/), my directory website.

When I shared it on social media, a guy told me he wanted to build something similar. I said, “If you want, I can give you the template with more customization features in the admin area.”

He said yes.

So I packaged it properly and launched [**Directory Hunt Script**](https://inuetc.gumroad.com/l/DirectoryHunt) for $99.

I’m not earning a lot yet from selling digital products.

But now I know something important:

This can become a **real income source** if I take it seriously.

And here’s the part you won’t believe.

Most of my customers come from **Medium**.

Not Instagram. Not LinkedIn. Not Threads.

Medium.

People read my articles. They understand how I think. They trust me. And then they buy.

I even get [freelancing clients](https://inuetc.medium.com/write-on-medium-and-get-clients-in-your-inbox-c90b0838bad3?sk=d27044dff9f1244e8cbe2e4f3bff12f9) from Medium.

So if you sell digital products like me, write on Medium.

Other platforms might give you attention. Medium gives you buyers.

**To everyone who bought my products and services. Thank you.** It really means a lot.

That felt different.

Someone who didn’t follow my journey. Didn’t know me personally. Just saw the offer and booked a call.

I’ve helped hundreds of people for free too. I regularly join free Google Meet calls when someone needs help. No payment. Just sharing what I know.

Sometimes they come back later as paid clients.

Should I be worried about getting a fine?

Some of the towns I might taking a stop at is: Сунгурларе, Cливeн, Гурково, Габрово, Дряново, Велико Търново, Елена, Върбица and Аспарухово. Are these OK places to be, or is there anything I should I know about them (dangerous, boring, etc.)? If you have any other suggestions for places that I should visit I would really like to know. 

If any of you live nearby I would love to visit and have a coffee or something. I will attach a screenshot of my route and a link if you like to look closer. Any help is really appreciated.

# The Problem With Most Directories

Like most founders, I’ve submitted my products to countless directories.

And honestly?  
Most of them feel the same.

You submit.  
You wait.  
You get listed.

Then… nothing.

Worse, many directories:

* add **nofollow** links
* remove listings after some time
* ask for monthly payments
* auto-publish everything (which kills SEO value)

So even if you get listed, the long-term benefit disappears.

As someone who actually cares about SEO, that never felt right.

# Why I Built Inuidea Hunt

I wanted something different.

A directory where:

* listings don’t disappear
* links actually pass value
* quality is protected
* founders don’t have to pay just to exist

So I built **Inuidea Hunt**.

Just a clean, curated place to give good products a permanent home.

If your product gets approved on Inuidea Hunt, you get:

* A **permanent listing**
* A **do-follow backlink f**rom a **DA 40 domain**
* Inside a **manually curated directory**

And yes — **submitting is completely free**.

# Why This Free Backlink Actually Matters

Backlinks still matter.

A do-follow link from a **curated directory**, surrounded by **relevant products**, on an **established domain** is very different from spammy link farms or mass directories with zero moderation.

Google still rewards quality signals.

That’s exactly what **Inuidea Hunt** is designed to protect.

# Optional Upgrades

Yes, there are optional upgrades:

* featured listings
* sponsored posts
* extra visibility

But if you don’t want to invest right now, the **free do-follow backlink alone is already a solid deal**.

# Who This Is For

Inuidea Hunt is for founders who:

* care about long-term SEO
* want backlinks that don’t disappear
* are building something genuinely useful
* prefer evergreen visibility over launch-day spikes

If that sounds like you, you’ll get why this exists.

If you’re building a SaaS, tool, newsletter, or digital product and want a **free, permanent do-follow backlink**, you know where to go.

I'm currently using a Sage(Breville) Barista Express, like many people, as an entry to making decent coffee at home. I've had it for about 3.5 years now and while the machine itself still performs adequately, I'm noticing I can rely on the built-in grinder less and less. It clumps a lot and is fairly inconsistent in grinding amounts aswell.

So it looks like it's about time to upgrade my grinder :)  
But boy, are there many options.   
As I'm not that versed in machines, I just want to dial it and then ""set and forget""  
And consistently get the dose right.

I've narrowed down a few options:

Mahlkönig X54 - €349  
Baratza Encore ESP Pro - €279  
Eureka Mignon Specialita - €399 *(But not GF Aesthetics approved..)*

I couldn't find any other decent looking ones.  
I'd be really happy if you all could guide me in the right direction:  
\-Are there better options out there, within my budget?  
\-Is there any one of these noticably better than the other?

Everything is technically there  sofa, coffee table, TV, bookshelves, and an armchair near the window  but the room feels like it hasn't decided what it is yet. I think the armchair might be the problem. It's a nice rust-colored fabric chair that I placed facing the window for a reading nook vibe, but nobody ever actually sits that way. We always twist toward the room. I tried angling it toward the sofa last weekend and it helped a little, but then it blocked the main walkway and my partner's silent frustration said everything. Now it's just back in the corner, vibing alone.

I also wonder if my rug is too small  it's a gray flatweave where the sofa legs are on it but the chair is completely off it, and I think that might be making the room feel like two areas that don't quite belong to each other. So now I don't know if this is a furniture problem, a rug problem, or just a room that needs one solid anchor piece to make everything else make sense.

When I was younger, one of my absolute favorite spoons was a long handled spoon(I'm thinking a dessert spoon, but I don't know), that had a thicker handle with a tapering to a rounded point end at the handle.  It was, if I remember correctly, a slightly more rounded bowl to the spoon portion.  Not a full circle, but not the more oblong oval sort of shape.  Kind of the in the middle, if that makes sense.  And I remember there was a crossing/hash mark on the handle, around mid to close to the bowl, in terms of decoration.  

Shape wise, body wise, is similar to this:  
[Unique Bargains Tea Coffee Dessert Stir Long Handle Spoon 16cm Length Silver Tone 5 PCS : Target](https://www.target.com/p/unique-bargains-tea-coffee-dessert-stir-long-handle-spoon-16cm-length-silver-tone-5-pcs--no-aasa/-/A-89270057)

It was more pointed, and I think it might have had a slight curve to a side with it. The bowl didn't have the angle to it that picture shows, but it was more inline with the handle.   

I know it was a vintage piece, from atleast the 1980's at the earliest.  I also know, atleast in terms of the cutlery we had at home, it was the only one of it's type so it was something that was either a leftover from a set or easily purchased on it's own.  In terms of metal, I want to say something hearty, as it had lasted that long without a speck of rust on it during the 20 or so years that I used it when I was younger.

Sadly, I lost it when my parents lost their house, and all of their belongings kind of ended up scattered.  Specifically, I used to love using it to eat jambalaya, as I could eat the rice part of it with the spoon, and stab the sausage and meat with the rounded pointy end.  
  
Again, I understand that this is the most ridiculous of searches, but... if anyone has any idea about what I could be looking for, I would love to see it.  Thank you in advance for any help you might give! ",1,1771578505.0,silverware,0,1.0,False

At first, I was in denial, but as I started to piece together the evidence, I realized that it was true. I felt devastated, hurt, and confused. I couldn't understand how he could do this to me and our family. After much thought and consideration, I decided to confront him about his affair. I was nervous and, but I knew that I had to do it for my own peace of mind. I arranged to meet him at a coffee shop, and I told him that I knew about his affair. He was shocked and tried to deny it, but I had the evidence to prove it. I told him that I was hurt and disappointed, but I also wanted to understand why he did it. He confessed that he felt neglected and unappreciated in our marriage, and that he found comfort and attention in his affair. I listened to him and tried to understand his perspective, but I also made it clear that his actions were not acceptable. I told him that I was willing to work on our marriage and fix the issues that led to his affair, but only if he was willing to end the affair and commit to our relationship. He agreed, and we started to go to couples therapy to work on our issues. It's been a long and difficult journey, but I'm proud of myself for confronting my husband and having an honest conversation with him. I'm still hurt and disappointed, but I'm also hopeful that we can rebuild our marriage and move forward together. Thanks for reading my story, and I'm open to any advice or support you may have.

If you feel that you can fit in naturally, DM me to join. Will have a quick intro about you and hopefully that goes forward.

**P:S: The meet-up/sesh will be paid but nominally (₹300/person) so that only genuinely interested people join and also pooled money can be used for food and beverages.**",0,1771576913.0,BangaloreMeetups,15,0.22,False

Hey everyone!

Can’t sleep so I’m typing this up.

Just to let you all know. I’m dealing with a break-up, it’s a poly thing so even though it was mutual and stuff it still kinda…. Sucks?

Idk it feels like I have less and less friends nowadays. My little group of friends I had turned out to be toxic. I moved for work and kind of have to come to that not so great conclusion of “oh wow… I don’t really have friends do I?”

I have autism and I’m still working on getting my adhd diagnosis. I’m a big advocate for mental health, in my own ways.

I’m not 100% sure if I want local friends or online friends. Local buddies would be nice but like… idk. I like botanical gardens, thrifting, watching the bbc version of pride and prejudice and the 2005 movie, reading gothic stuff, doodling, going to get coffee.

I love roleplaying and writing. I used to write KH fanfiction when I was young lol. Back when the SoKai and the SoRiku shipping wars were at their peak lol.

Idk, I’d like to think imma down to earth person.

I just want friends who draw, write, like monster men (bonus points for Sukuna and Garrus Vakarian), and play FFXIV.",0,1771576910.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I am looking at a recipe for GF coffee cake (https://meaningfuleats.com/gluten-free-coffee-cake-with-sour-cream/) and it calls for 1 1/2 cups 1:1 GF flour. Problem is, I only have about 1 cup! But I do also have enough almond flour to make up the difference. Would this be doable? Are there any considerations with bake times, would i need to add more xantham gum, or anything else i need to keep in mind for it to work? Or do I just go ahead and buy another bag of 1:1?

My partner and I are visiting Portland for the first time April.  We’re flying in from LA and planning to rent a car for a few day trips (Gorge + possibly the coast).
We’d love advice on:
• Best neighborhoods to stay for first-timers
• Areas that are best avoided (especially at night)
• Whether it’s better to stay downtown vs east side
• Parking tips if we have a rental car
• Must-try coffee spots or restaurants
• Any April weather tips we should prepare for
We like a mix of walkable areas, good food, and a cozy vibe. Not huge partiers — more into exploring, coffee, and scenic views.
Anything you wish first-time visitors knew?

I’m 23, and I’m a bit of a rojak mix (born in MY, staying in SG, with some TW blood from my grandma). I dropped out of school a couple of years ago to raise my little one, and now I’m back in the grind working as an office admin.

Between the 9-to-6 office life and being a single mom, I realized I’ve completely lost touch with how to make ""adult"" friends. Most people my age are still in Uni or out partying, but I’m usually just home with Netflix or listening to Mandopop once the baby is asleep.

I feel like I’m at a weird crossroads where I’m too ""young"" for the mummy groups but too ""busy"" for the usual social scenes. Does anyone else feel like they’re just ""floating"" in SG?

Also, if anyone has recommendations for good quiet spots for coffee or even just some new music/movie recs to keep me company, I’d love to hear them. My DMs are open if anyone wants to share their ""surviving SG"" tips with a confused admin girl HAHA",5,1771576662.0,ChillSG,19,0.65,False
1r9q0un,https://v.redd.it/e01lfvcq2mkg1,DJS Key – A Virtual Android Keyboard Perfect for Drawing ASCII Art,"I’ve been working for several months on the Android keyboard of my dreams. A keyboard that does what others don’t, focused on productivity, fun, freedom of use, and privacy.

It includes full PC-style keys, multiple layouts, floating mode, and it doesn’t send any data to any server. It also supports addons!

The keyboard itself is completely free, but premium addons are paid (about the price of a coffee ☕).

I’m currently building several addons. Right now I’m working on a Unicode Fonts addon. I’ve already released **DrawKey**, an addon that lets you draw ASCII art in a simple and intuitive way. I tried to arrange the symbols intelligently to make the drawing experience smooth and fast.

I’m sharing a short video below, along with the website and the app link — I’d really appreciate your feedback!

1r9q06k,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeSaaS/comments/1r9q06k/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_of_negative_app_reviews/,I Went Down a Rabbit Hole of Negative App Reviews. Some Patterns Are Hard to Ignore.,"Lately I’ve been entertaining myself in a very questionable way.

Reading negative reviews, Not even kidding, it’s more educational than half the startup advice floating around. When users get annoyed enough, they explain exactly what’s broken with absolutely no filter. It’s basically raw product feedback without the corporate sugar coating.

Some repetitive comments that caught my eye were:

**Weather apps are weirdly dramatic for tools that check the Sky**.

you look outside. Perfect sunshine You check the app. Storm incoming.

Every weather app behaves like it has a flair for suspense. AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, doesn’t matter. Reviews are full of people saying the same thing, How are you this confident and this wrong? Honestly, an app that just admits uncertainty would already feel more trustworthy. Nobody expects psychic powers. Just don’t hallucinate rain.

**Calendar apps love turning simple planning into admin Work**

All you wanted was to note a meeting. Suddenly you’re managing colors, views, settings, reminders, layouts. Google Calendar wins because it’s glued into everything, but using it isn’t exactly a joyful experience. There’s a lot of silent friction in scheduling that nobody talks about. Users don’t want to “manage” time. They just want clarity.

**To do list apps that drives us crazy**

Task apps have a habit of feature spirals. You install it to remember groceries. Next thing you know you’re dealing like that one girl with color coded notes. By the time everything is perfectly organized, you’re too tired to actually do the tasks.

There's a reason minimal tools like Todoist keep their user base. Fast entry, low ceremony, done. Complexity is rarely the selling point users think they want.

**Expense trackers that eat us alive**

Manual expense logging always sounds responsible. It also always collapses. Nobody consistently records every coffee purchase like a disciplined finance monk. Apps like Walnut got popular by scraping SMS data because they stopped pretending users would behave perfectly.

Good financial tools assume laziness and work with it, not against it.

**Builder tools underestimate how annoying design decisions are**

This one’s funny. Creator tools love advertising freedom. Total control. Infinite customization. In reality, that often means endless tiny decisions. Padding, alignment, spacing, fonts, layouts. It’s mentally draining. A lot of builders would happily trade freedom for sane defaults and structure.

That’s why tools like PrettiFlow([https://prettiflow.tech](https://prettiflow.tech/)) are interesting. They lean into components and guardrails so you’re not stuck micromanaging visuals for hours. You build faster, things look decent by default, life moves on. Most people building products care about momentum, not pixel perfection.

Final verdict to all the startup fellas out there, start solving existing problems rather than trying to search for new problems to solve!!.",1,1771576549.0,NoCodeSaaS,0,1.0,False

I have a few friends that I've had since i was a kid but I really feel like we are growing apart in our values, morals, hobbies, etc.

I have some friends but they are overall a negative impact in my life. It sucks to say that cuz I have known them since i was a kid but I need positivity and people that have more in common with me. something strictly platonic. if it gets any more than platonic im ok with that too but i mainly want a friend or 2. A new person or friend group.

Thing is, I am mostly a homebody. I have been a gamer my whole life (just build my first PC in May so thats been fun...except none if my friend play sooo that sucks.. huge plus if you game) and I like to cook and get food or coffee/boba. Maybe go for walks or even a hike idk. Ive been trying to work on my health with food (its been going alright) and working out (its been going ok but could be better). going for a drive somewhere and chill. idk just throwin stuff out there.

I used to smoke weed but I quit this past new years and its been good. I dont care if you smoke though, no problem. I dont drink very much maybe like 2 or 3 times a year at a family gathering. I enjoy watching youtube, some shows or anime. I am bi if that matters.

I need a change of pace... change of scenery... someone to vent to if needed. I need more positive vibes. idk just giving this a shot. lmk. thanks byeee.",7,1771576427.0,SanJose,8,0.9,False
