A couple weeks after we had that conversation, I invited her to my cottage with my family, which happens to be this weekend. Now that I‚Äôm back feeling in a not so good place about our relationship, I‚Äôm not sure when I want to have another conversation.. We‚Äôre driving up with my dad on Friday, and coming back just the two of us on Monday. I could offer to have the conversation over lunch tomorrow, or save it for when we return next week sometime. I don‚Äôt think this weekend will be hard if I don‚Äôt have it. I‚Äôm sure these adverse feelings and anxiety will go down once we‚Äôre actually together, but being apart is hard. My anxiety is through the roof and I‚Äôve been trying to sleep for hours before typing this, which is very abnormal for me.

1ksjpve,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1ksjpve/your_average_cs_tryhard/,Your average CS tryhard,"Hello! I am Brad Best, and if you are reading this, my career is a complete failure. Right now I'm working as a barista in Starbucks because I couldn't find a job to save my ass despite having a 4.0 GPA and sending 100 applications a day. I am doing everything right! Why wouldn't life give me success at all!

# Freshman Year: The Start

It all started when I applied to Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Berkeley, UT Austin, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Cornell, and literally every single T20 under the sun, because we all know if you don't get a T20 you're a failure for life. And you wanna know what I got? ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå as unexpected. Even worse, my best friends all got into Stanford and MIT and Harvard and I failed to get into a good college. üò≠üò≠  

  
Whatever. I hate my high school friends! They're wrong! Those universities are wrong! I am the rightest person in the world!  So of course I enrolled in the Podunk State University, knowing I need to work 10x as hard to break into FAANG or Wall Street Quant or $500M VC funding in Silicon Valley and Palo Alto and San Francisco. I need to do that or I'll be a failure. And of course I call everyone else in Podunk State a failure! 

The first thing I need to do is get into CS. Now this weird thing is Podunk State has this thing called E2M or Entry to Major, where engineering freshmen compete with their college GPA to get into computer science. I joined absolutely zero clubs freshman year because they're just trying to distract me from the real goal: MONEYYYY!!! I need MONEY! THAT'S WHY I AM IN CS. So I grinded my ass off, choosing to compete against my peers in GPA. This means cheating test banks and all of that stuff, since our school has an honor code: ""A Podunkian does not get caught by the Honor System.""

After grinding enough, I got a 4.0 GPA and got into CS.

# Sophomore Year: The Continuation

So YEAHHH, I AM IN COMPUTER SCIENCE!!! I lost all my friends but who cares? Friends don't get me money or an internship! All my friends failed to get into Computer Science so I just ignore them and cut them off! Because we know I'm gonna be the boss! 

First thing was joining orgs. Except many of them just reject me: nah they don't like me but I am better than them! I joined a professional org called PCSC or the Podunk Computer Science Club. Of course none of us take showers at all but who cares, I just wanna code to get than seven figures FAANG or QUANT job! Or maybe start a tech startup to become the next ELON MUSK! I dropped PCSC the moment I was not elected president. I need a good resume booster.

I tried to do research with a professor. So I walked into a meeting and asked to do research. The professor know me well and declined. WHY??? IT'S THE PROFESSOR'S FAULT! HE'S TOO STUPID! Why would he reject me if I had been in his class for 1 year already???? Ok, but I begged, and I asked to get a research internship but he said how he need to check funding requirements with NSF and all of that BS. Eventually, he told me if I continue asking he would lower my grade. And I need to get a 4.0 GPA.

So I finished Sophomore Year with no organizations and no friends and no internship.

# Junior Year: The Meltdown

It's Junior Year and I'm looking at my high school friends linkedin and they're getting internships already? Really? I just cannot get anything and I have a 4.0 GPA? Come on! THIS IS UNFAIR. Someone suggested I enroll in a sales program to boost my people skills: really NO WAY AM I STOOPING DOWN TO LEARN COMMUNICATION. I cut him off right away.

I am super jealous of my peers who are actually succeeding in life, like I am falling behind. I cannot be unemployed. So I decided to lock in.

I created a startup and many projects, such as building an AI app that tracks student analytics and all of these cool features. Nobody uses it? This is unfair, mine is the most technically elegant product! I made another app that replaces ""Podunk Network"" with ""Stupid Network"" since it is true!

I join organizations if and only if they have alumni in FAANG or startups. I went to career fairs to talk to recruiters, but recruiters keep on telling me EW, you smell bad. Why should my hygiene tell me I cannot get a job if I can code for them!

I sent out 200 internship application and got one interview. At the interview I asked questions like ""I am the best person here"" and then they just showed me out the door. Like WHY? I can help the CEO make money by coding for them!

# Senior Year: The Explosion

My school's network is so useless? Like nobody in Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google? Really? And no VC funding for my idea that's suppose to rake in $100 million dollars! Come on! This is hot garbage! I hate the Podunk Network! It's filled with dumbasses who couldn't string together three words! My professor is wrong for rejecting me, and so are the recruiters. All my friends got in just because they were likeable, not because of merit!

I submitted 524 applications, customizing every resume for the job. Luckily, I got a hefty 15 interviews, and zero offers. Really? Why am I keep on failing these interviews? If each interview has a 90% chance of converting surely the chance of failing all of those is one in a quadrillion! This must be rigged! Looking at the backup plans be like:

`Sorry, but we do not think you are a good fit for our company.`

WTF is FIT? I am so jacked up like an alpha male and I can code for your company so many things like ChatGPT on steroids. I started scrolling on LinkedIn of my old friends who hate me, as I tried to connect but they all refused, probably because they're plotting against me:

* Incoming SWE at Google
* Interning at Renaissance Technologies
* Building a B2B company in AI development
* Being an AI policy advisor for Donald Trump
* Created a crypto hedge fund that raised one billion dollars

I still got no calls. I blame everyone! I blamed all the universities that rejected me! I blame my friends for not helping me! I blame my university for being so useless! I blame Earth for hurting me! I blame the person reading this post! I blame everyone at my universities having a social life while I grind Leeetcode! I blame my professors for not getting me that internship! I blame everyone that is not named ""Brad Best"" for not being Brad Best. 

# Now?

My career is in shambles. And it is because of you who stole my spot at Harvard or Yale or Princeton! It is because of all the engineers! Like come on! 

If I will give advice to yall, **if you don't go to a top 20, you will be a failure like me serving coffee at Starbucks**. Listen to me, I am always right because I can solve Leetcode hards in 5 minutes! There goes my dream of being a billionaire startup FAANG founder in Silicon Valley. üò≠üò≠üò≠



*Note from OP: If this sounds like you, know the advice is actually bad advice that will likely backfire. High Schoolers tend to optimize for being successful in life when they optimize for college, but success is built on true, genuine relationships. I realized a lot of people go to college for networking and prestige signaling, but they come in with an extractor mindset. This works in the short-term but you will quickly lose trust, reputation, and eventually people willing to help you.*

1ksjor6,https://i.redd.it/at0quz95z92f1.gif,"Whiterose Is Probably The Best WLW Ship In This Show (Or Best Ship In General, Fight Me)","Hi guys, Mediocre-Cycle here. It's time I mediocre on the cycle.

The second most popular ship in RWBY, this is Whiterose! I want to show genuine appreciation for Whiterose because it is literally a *perfect* ship. Okay, it's not *perfect,* but it's a great friendship and dynamic and there should be more scenes of it, goddammit. Starting off with the conception, then going to the execution, giving off why this ship works and why it doesn't, and concluding it. Let's get started, shall we?

# WHITEROSE - THE CONCEPT IS GAS

Do I need to explain why this ship is great conceptually?

Ruby and Weiss are the easiest character archetypes for a ship. The girl of sunshine and the girl of cold ice. The forever flowing freedom of the wind and the cold darkness of the ice. The sweet and loving and the bratty and cold. Most of their interactions and bond even in the show is fun because Ruby brings all of the energy and Weiss either detests it or follows along begrudgingly. Basically, **opposites attract.**

They're both **direct parallels** to each other in terms of design. Ruby's silver eyes mixes with Weiss' white color scheme, Weiss' red pops and ties into Ruby's red, and they both are the original two introduced for RWBY. They have a lot of smaller connections (like short hair Ruby vs long ponytail Weiss), but those are the main two that work. 

Back to their personalities though, I think something to tie in with their personalities is just how much they foil and constract each other. Both come from a long line of huntsman, while Ruby represents more of freedom and the wind while Weiss (originally) is more of an ice queen and a thawed girl. Weiss is more of a stickler to the rules and is more affirmative and set on her goals, while Ruby is carefree and allows herself to express more fun and love. I kinda touched onto this on the first paragraph. Both have a big sibling that's a huntress (eventually for Yang) and have contrasting family interactions (Ruby loves all of her family no matter what, and Weiss has a disregard for most of her family barring Winter). 

There's probably more to go through, but these are the main three that show a good contrast and connection in terms of a conceptual line. Now, the execution!!!

# WHITEROSE - EXECUTION

V1 and V3 did so much for Whiterose, man.

They start off as simple as a defrosting ice queen trope does; when they meet up for the first time, she tumbles into everything and makes a mess, which Weiss scolds her for. When they properly reintroduce, Ruby and Weiss do hit it off... Interestingly. Ruby does a lot of antics and Weiss is annoyed, and it's genuinely fun banter. Then, when Weiss is annoyed with Ruby being the leader and she snaps and goes to Port about it, she softens up and becomes generally nicer to Ruby after giving her coffee. They had an actual development with their relationship that I found to be sweet (though I do wish Weiss' progression with her relationship with Ruby slowed down a little or had more scenes in volume 1, will get to it later). 

In Volume 3 (V2 didn't show much besides them hugging and crying together, ig Ruby also mourns over Weiss' corpse in the food fight), Ruby and Weiss during the fall have some touching moments, like when Weiss holds Ruby's hands when the former knows that Ruby's alright, and when Ruby tries to find them, Weiss comes along to help, and even when they separate, Weiss tells Ruby that she *can* do this, and it's neat seeing them together like this. 

In Volume 4-6, I think it's arguably more implied here, even if the scenes are short. To give simplified parts...

- Nora talks about the SDC and Ruby visibly becomes saddened over Weiss. The transition shows Weiss looking out the window, and it is pretty obvious that they're thinking about each other

- Ruby playfully hugs and shakes around Weiss in volume... 5, I think, and Weiss is annoyed at this

- Ruby chases after Weiss happily in the opening for volume 6 while on the train 

- Ruby and Weiss during V6E1, Weiss protects Ruby from a Manticore attack and Ruby catches onto Weiss to save her from falling off the train, both of them holding hands before they burst into a mixture of red AND white

- during V6E5, Ruby meets up with Weiss as she's in a blanket and Ruby expresses that she could have food if she's going to get cheered up, despite Weiss being disappointed and clearly wanting something else. It's a nice comparison between what we get from Bumblebee in this episode, where Yang struggles to be alone with Blake and Ruby expresses concerns over Qrow's alcoholism and Weiss emphasizes and relates due to her issues with Willow's drinking problems

And some more. These are the mains ones that I got. A lot of personal stuff in V7-V9 isn't really here (something I will comment on later), buuuuuuut volume 9 helps bring this back as Weiss is the only person to point out that Ruby didn't communicate her issues, pointing out that their attempts to help her out only burdened Ruby with more struggle. The fact that Weiss catches onto this is really sweet and makes a lot of sense for her character. 

So, pretty padded out stuff! They don't get a lot of substance, but that should be another talking point I'll say soon. In fact...

# WHITEROSE - WHY IT WORKS AND WHY IT DOESN'T

Here's the rundown. I will give three reasons as to why Whiterose could work as a ship, and three reasons as to why not. They'll be short, quick, and should've been foreshadowed from what I already answered beforehand. 

**Why It Works**

1 - **Conceptually good.** Opposites attract and defrosting ice queen are perfect tropes that they did pretty well, and their relationship felt pretty sweet afterwards. With their matching color scheme and how they were introduced, it works pretty great!

2 - **It easily has the most execution of a ship in the show.** Maybe barring Lancaster, Whiterose has easily the most interactions and personal moments in the series for a ship overall, only possibly thwarted by Bumblebee in V7-V9, and even then they'd be really close. Impressive for a ship that's not even canonical. 

3 - **It has amazing chemistry.** Probably barring Nuts N' Dolts, Weiss is the girl Ruby bounces off of the most. Their interactions are cute, and they have genuine things to bond over (like Qrow and Willow's alcoholic issues and their combat dress love and their obsession with dogs). Honestly, they have more of a realistic depiction of a genuine relationship than Bumbleby does. It genuinely feels like they could have a relationship, especially when they become closer.

**Why It Doesn't Work**

1 - **Substance.** As I said before, Whiterose has an issue with genuine substance and having personal interactions even despite their plentiful amount. V2 and V3 don't even have all that much, despite being the building blocks for this relationship. Also, Weiss gets shipped with Neptune in these two volumes, so **NEEEEPTTUUUUUNNNEEEE** ruined it.

2 - **Too late.** If they were to make the ship canonical now, it'd be WAYYY too late and would be incredibly surprising. I think it could blend well, but even then it would be a jarring shift and something surprisingly odd.

3 - **Lack of genuine romance.** As much as I could love this ship, the ship tease even for it isn't something that has shined. Most of what I said can be said for a platonic and BFF relationship. Supplementary material have shown *far, far more* than the canon proper. 

# CONCLUSION

...Okay. This post isn't meant really for informing people, but mostly for a hint of entertainment and a touch of persuasion. Whiterose is my favorite ship *to date,* and it has a lot of reasons why. Tons of people love this ship, and there have been [blogs showing how good it is.](https://www.tumblr.com/yurireview/183037819977/whiterose-masterpost) Even without the romantic aspect, it's easily the best platonic/romantic pairing in the show. 

However, this *can* be used to inform based off of what it had in the show proper. Even in the tightest and best relationship in this show, there's still a surprisingly lack of substance for such a tight pairing, especially in V7-V8. But mostly, this is mainly a Whiterose appreciation post. The title is mainly an exaggeration (despite me believing it personally but blehhh), but it's just a fun ship that I personally dig! That should be all, now. I'm eepy. Bye bye :).",0,1747894300.0,RWBYcritics,0,0.5,False

1ksjn3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ksjn3o/i_25f_am_having_serious_doubts_about_my/,I (25F) am having serious doubts about my relationship with my fiance (25M) please help,"This will be long I'm sorry, I just really need some unbiased opinions and advice because my relationship feels very changed since we got engaged. 

We got engaged in mid 2024 after almost 5 years together. We haven't lived together (I come from a traditional European family and we wait until marriage or engagement at least while he is anglo-celtic) but had a happy relationship throughout. We love each other, we've had holidays/travels and we have both worked towards our future, better jobs, and have recently bought an apartment together which we are renovating (bought Nov 2024). Important to note that I put 75% of the deposit for this down and he brought 25%. We're both in well paying professions and the home ownership is 50/50 (I know I'm stupid and should have done it per the amount we put in, blame blind trust).

The issues began after our engagement - I felt his parents change towards me, particularly his mother and there was a bit more distance. My biggest issue was the fact that despite his parents being invited over to my parents home for coffee or just stopping by, they have never once extended an invite to us. My parents have never stepped foot in their house, even 10 months after the engagement. My mother made attempts to get to know his mother, particularly during the engagement party planning but this was not reciprocated. My future MIL also has held a long grudge about the fact that I requested to change the engagement lunch venue simply because it did not fit 25 people. My mother found a suitable alternative for the same price, at a better location, better service and food so I thought it would be the end of it after I apologised and explained the reasoning. My MIL also gave my mother an insulting letter through her son (my fiance) counting the costs of the lunch down to the last cent. I won't go into that here but my mother was extremely insulted and unhappy.

I feel there has also been some resentment on their end because we bought an apartment closer to my parents - this was a strategic decision as it's a better area and closer to our CBD. The distance between the apartment to his parents is a 35 min drive while it's about 10 min to my parents. Nothing like moving cities. His mother hasn't stepped foot in our apartment once to see what we bought. There's been a lot of tension between my fiance and I due to his family not making any attempt to invite us - it's a disrespect in our culture and I've spoken to my fiance countless times about it. He never did anything really to help fix it. In fact, I think he's been the reason for this huge divide as he's specifically kept our families seperate. This is a big no no in my culture - how do you expect to have children if their grandparents won't say a word to each other and behave this way? 

His father is a tiler and has been helping renovate our apartment and my fiance specifically wanted my father to not be involved in any of the process (my father is an engineer by background and has renovated his own house) so I felt controlled and like I couldn't go to my own father for his opinions on things because it made my fiance feel like I go to my dad first. I'll also add that my future FIL made it very clear with his words he was not doing the renovations because he wanted to, rather out of a feeling of obligation by his son - he made many comments about me making things more difficult because I asked questions about how fall is created in a shower, about the tapware that I picked and the tiles being harder to cut because they're porcelain (all tile shops recommend porcelain over ceramic because of durability). Things just designed to make me feel like shit. My fiance has never stood up for me when these things happen. I feel like he's still a child, hasn't grown up and matured enough into a man that can stand up for his future wife. His father has thrown divorce comments to our face and even my parents as in ""Ah don't worry if it doesn't work out, you can always get divorced"". What an awful mindset.

This entire thing is ripping us apart and has me doubting a lot. He's changed since the engagement too. He has brought up the fact that I sometimes buy a $4 punnet of tomatoes at the grocery store for my work lunches. Or stopping at the chemist for mascara. Worse, he brought up that I buy groceries for my family to cook at home and he gets no benefit?? How dare he? I brought 75% into that apartment, I have never paid a cent of rent to my parents, he still lives with his parents, and he dares to question how I spend this little bit of money? He's always been tight with money but this threw me off big time. I can cook for my family whenever I damn well please, after everything they've done for me. He's asked me to sell my crypto I have saved for emergencies and something I accumulated many years before him. I don't want to do this - I've brought enough money in and this is for me only. Where did he find the audacity to ask me this after contributing so little to the purchase?

Another major point is he omits things on purpose. He didn't tell me when works were being done in the apartment and the reason this is a big problem is because my father and I specifically told him to cancel those works because they were not compliant with national standards. He went ahead and purposely kept it hidden. He's kept it hidden when he's gone out with friends before too ""to avoid an argument"" despite the fact I don't keep him from going out with his friends. He likes to manipulate his words and outright denies saying things when I put him on the spot. Maybe he's always been this way and I was stupid blind but I'm sure as hell noticing this now. Before you advise to talk to each other, we already have and he can never give me a straight answer for things. Always finds ways to take the longest roundabout, he's not concise or assertive.

So, I just need some help please. My parents are not liking what they're seeing either - they also saw him speaking to me with a very angry tone because of something renovation related. My father didn't take to this kindly, for my fiance to raise his voice at me right in front of his own FIL. What would you do in my situation? Can this be worked on, or are these issues too large and will only get worse?

TLDR: My fiance's behaviour has changed since the engagement with problems around being controlling with money, lying by omission and twisting his words when it suits him, keeping our families divided and not standing up for me the way I believe a man should.

1ksjmp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1ksjmp4/how_to_interact_with_a_bipolar_woman_as_an/,How to interact with a bipolar woman as an autistic man?,"I have been interested in a female acquaintance for a few years. We are both successful professionals. She is smart, beautiful, kind, brave, and more fascinating as time goes on. Animals come up to her like Snow White. She‚Äôs like a magnet- men flirt with her constantly, she charms everyone, I hear people talk about how cool she is all the time when she is not around. She speaks her mind to everyone, and somehow everyone loves her for it (unlike me, for some reason). Very emotive. She is caring and is also aware of and specifically inclusive towards autistic people. With every person, she asks directly what they want or why they do things, and tells the truth, but again people seem to love her for it. Everyone says she is weird but it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. She also clearly does not care what people think and gets openly irritated with people, and they still like her. Though a few people have said they get a vibe that she shouldn‚Äôt be messed with. She is unlike anyone I‚Äôve ever met.

I‚Äôve always felt a connection to her but I never can predict how she will react with me. I have a really hard time scripting out conversations because she doesn‚Äôt get hints, sometimes she goes off on tangents, sometimes she acts strangely. I noticed that she will often tell people why she is acting a certain way and how she is feeling, but that those two things are the opposite. For example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being extra friendly because actually I‚Äôm in a bad mood and don‚Äôt want people to take it personally, so please leave me alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not drinking coffee right now so my brain hasn‚Äôt woken up, but I have a ton of energy. I can‚Äôt talk about complex things right now.‚Äù She is confident but gets very nervous. She seems to flirt but is shocked when people think she is coming onto them.

She also can be very intense in a way that overwhelms me. She is not patient with emotional matters- her emotions are fast and big and she has no problem expressing and talking about how she feels. I need time. She often pushes me for answers. She will say she wants something but change her mind. She will make plans and be excited then be quiet and shy day of. She gets very anxious to the point of shutting herself away for days, but is very social. She will say she likes me, then not pay much attention to me when I‚Äôm around.

I started to get suspicious of her. Then I overheard her tell a friend she has bipolar. She is on medication and goes to therapy and has a workbook that helps her work through her feelings. That explained a lot. I started to do research on bipolar. But there is not too much known about it and it‚Äôs all confusing and contradictory. It sounds scary for everyone involved and painful for the person. It is technically neurodivergence. It seems to be divergence of emotional experience rather than social function. Larger spectrum of emotions than normal humans. How can anyone explain what that is like if we don‚Äôt have words for it? It‚Äôs like explaining a color that is naked to the human eye. Episodes change a person‚Äôs personality and they can‚Äôt control it, even if they know it‚Äôs happening. I am at a loss for how to understand her now. And I am a little afraid of her and afraid for her.

1ksjmj8,https://i.redd.it/2xatvjfcy92f1.jpeg,What to do with bug infested wood,"I'm still very new to woodworking. A few months ago I bought some ash slabs from a guy on the French Craigslist. The dude said ut was an ash tree on his property that he had milled about 40 years ago. 

I didn't think to inspect the lumber first and brought it into my house. After examination, some of the boards had spalting, discoloration and a bit of punky wood, some had some curly grain and one was dark like olive ash. All of them had bug holes (one a lot more than the others), but I figured it must have been from a while back. 

A few days ago, my mom gave me some plum logs from my grandmother's tree to make things with. I sealed the end grain, debarked and split them, only to find bug holes inside the logs. After a quick Google search, I put the plum wood outside and poured some turpentine into the holes. Thirty seconds later, the little buggers come out. I'm guessing they're common furniture beetles. 

That gave me the idea to try the same thing with the ash slabs. I poured some turpentine onto the one with the most holes and, what do you know? They were inhabited. 

I'm bummed, the boards cost me 80 bucks, they're beautiful. It's a bit discouraging. I don't have a kiln, and my oven or freezer aren't that big. I'm thinking of buying some borax based insecticide, but I don't know how effective that would be. 

Other than that, maybe I can cut them into chunks small enough to fit into my oven. Maybe make some stickers for wood drying/storage. Or just scrap the lumber altogether and move on, right now I only have a few tools and a finished coffee table in contact but I definitely don't want to contaminate any future lumber I will be working on. 

I don't know if it's even worth the headache. What would you do? ",1,1747894039.0,woodworking,1,1.0,False

I have a Bambino Plus with a Smart Grinder Pro. I use a WDT as well.

I normally drink cafe latte, locally roasted med/dark beans and have been super-focussed on 18 grams in, 36 grams out (using scales under my cup) in about 25 seconds first to last drop. I do this by holding down the 2-cup button for a second on my Bambino to start a manual shot, and press it again when my scales show 34 grams, it settles at \~36. I'm loving the results, especially since I've started nailing my milk steaming (i've even learned to glare at people in the cafe who ask for their cappucino/latte/flat white ""extra hot"").

Yesterday I held down the button to start the manual shot and got distracted with something else in the kitchen. By the time I turned back I had 40 grams in my cup with about 30 seconds on the timer, and after hitting the button to kill the shot I ended up with 45 grams in about 33 seconds. 

I was five minutes from my first meeting of the day so I figured bugger it, I can always hit it with some sugar if it's too bitter (I never add sugar to my coffee). So I steamed my milk, made the latte and headed toward my desk. The result was without doubt the tastiest cafe latte I've made to date. Deliciously strong, cacao and caramel with bold bitterness on every sip. Did the same thing meaningfully again this morning and hot damn I'm impressed.

So a message to my fellow newbies, once you're dialled in and reckon you've got your technique and routine down pat don't be afraid to fk with some variables to try the results. So glad I did! 1:2.5 for me with these beans from now on.",0,1747893883.0,espresso,0,0.13,False

I've been denied because I don't have one. Is there a way to get one? Im so much more experienced in what they are asking for I just lack a clearance. 

How do I break into this secret job market that's clearly in demand for people. I do have aerospace/defense background of 7 years as well but never had to have a clearance. We were ITAR compliant that was about it for security. We did have a skiff with taclanes but only one person was able to get into the room from my team when there was a problem. I've applied to L3 Harris and Honeywell with similar results. 

I did do work with fiber cross connects with our company and NASA in Huntsville redstone arsenal. But no clearance was needed just some paperwork at the guard gate.

I've worked with people at Vandenberg AFB getting things setup. They are so poorly under staffed and skilled. Someone of my caliber would elevate their whole group.

Am I just out of luck? Or just keep trying and maybe they will get desperate they will apply for a clearance for me? I have a friend who works for the secrety of the state in cyber security. We went to the same high school. He was no one,  but now he is a big wig with a TS/SCI. How does one go from that to there?

It was definitely our first ""proper"" relationship and it had a lot of difficulties. He was very difficult to be with and I don't mean that with any disrespect but that meant the break up was very rough too. The main reason I stayed with him for so long was because of his mother. I have a very difficult relationship with my mother and I spent a lot of time with my ex's family and we got along really well. His mom was very supportive of me and has helped me through some of my hardest times and was always a shoulder to lean on. She knew how difficult her son could be too, and often helped me try to approach it and made sure I never felt uncomfortable at her house. We both has similar issues in our upbringing so we genuinely had such a connection. She saw herself in me and I see myself in her, and we both called her my 2nd mother. His mother and I have spoken a few times since the break up and she always reminds me that she's there for me and has offered to take me out for coffee. 

It sounds harsh but I don't really care to factor my ex's feelings into this, I was broken after the break up and I feel like to this day I'm still grieving that relationship me and his mother had. My main issue is that I've been in a new relationship with my current boyfriend for the past year and a half and I obviously want to be considerate of his feelings with all this. I know it would be weird for him if I see my ex's mum and he has said it's weird that she messages me a couple times a year. I'm just finding it really difficult even 2 years later, I genuinely think about her all the time and it's horrible grieving someone that only lives half an hour away. She messaged me a couple days ago so I guess that brought up a lot of old feelings, I've been crying about this for the past 2 hours, but I know I've felt like this since the breakup. I've had a rough couple of years that I know her support could have helped with but I was always too scared to reach out myself in case it was weird for her with me being her sons ex, or weird for my boyfriend, or that i'll get a huge paragraph from my ex having a go at me for talking to his mother, but she always tells me to reach out so I don't really know how inappropriate it would be. Honestly, this is nothing to do with my ex at all, I never want to see him again, all he caused was pain and trust issues. I just really miss his mum.

## Key Features Analysis

The Keurig water dispenser market continuously evolves, with manufacturers introducing new features and technologies to enhance convenience and performance. Expect advancements in filtration, temperature control, and smart integration.

**Advanced Filtration System**

The core function of any water dispenser is its ability to deliver clean,filtered water. Top-of-the-line Keurig water dispensers in 2025 will likely feature multi-stage filtration systems incorporating activated carbon filters, sediment pre-filters, and potentially even UV sterilization. These systems remove a wide range of contaminants, including chlorine, lead, bacteria, and microplastics, ensuring that the dispensed water is not only pure but also tastes great. The filter life indicator will become even more sophisticated, accurately tracking water usage and prompting timely filter replacements.

**Precise Temperature Control**

Keurig is renowned for its temperature control capabilities in coffee brewing, and this expertise extends to their water dispensers. Expect models with precise temperature settings for both hot and cold water. These settings will allow you to choose the ideal temperature for various beverages,such as teas,coffees,and even specific culinary applications. Advanced models will also offer programmable temperature presets, allowing you to quickly dispense water at your preferred temperature with a single touch.

**Instant Hot Water Technology**

Instant hot water is a key selling point for Keurig water dispensers. Next-generation models will leverage improved heating elements and insulation technologies to deliver hot water even faster and more efficiently.The response time will be nearly instantaneous, eliminating the need to wait for water to heat up. Furthermore, expect intelligent energy management systems to minimize standby power consumption without sacrificing performance.

**User-Amiable Interface**

An intuitive user interface is crucial for ease of use. The best Keurig water dispensers in 2025 will feature touch-screen displays with clear icons and straightforward navigation. The interface will provide real-time information about water temperature,filter status,and dispensing volume. Some models may even incorporate voice control or smartphone integration, allowing you to remotely monitor and control the dispenser.

**Smart Dispensing Features**

Advanced models will likely include smart dispensing features, such as pre-programmed dispensing volumes and hands-free operation. Pre-programmed volumes will allow you to dispense specific amounts of water with a single button press, perfect for filling cups, bottles, or pots. Hands-free operation, enabled by proximity sensors, will dispense water automatically when a container is placed near the nozzle, enhancing hygiene and convenience.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**

Maintaining a water dispenser requires regular cleaning to prevent the buildup of scale and bacteria. Many Keurig water dispensers in 2025 will feature automatic self-cleaning cycles that sanitize the water tank and dispensing system at pre-set intervals. This feature simplifies maintainance and ensures that the dispensed water remains consistently clean and safe.

## Core Benefits

Keurig water dispensers offer numerous advantages that make them a valuable addition to any home or office, improving convenience, health, and overall lifestyle.

**Improved Hydration:** Having readily available filtered hot and cold water encourages increased water consumption throughout the day. Families and work teams benefit as it‚Äôs easier to access healthy hydration options. This leads to improved overall wellness and productivity.

**Enhanced Beverage Preparation:** The precise temperature control allows users to brew the perfect cup of tea or coffee, enhancing the flavor and aroma. Different teas require different temperatures to release their optimal taste ‚Äì from delicate green teas to robust black teas. With just a touch,water is always at the right temperature.

**Simplified Cooking:** Hot water on demand simplifies cooking tasks, such as blanching vegetables, making soups, or rehydrating dried foods. Rather of waiting for water to boil on the stovetop, hot filtered water is available immediately. This saves not only time, but the energy needed to heat water in a kettle or using a microwave oven.

**Cost Savings:** By eliminating the need for bottled water, Keurig water dispensers provide long-term cost savings.Over time, the cost of using a water dispenser is offset by the savings realized from reducing/eliminating bottled water purchases. This makes it an environmentally friendly and economically smart choice.

**Space Efficiency:** Compared to bulky water coolers,Keurig water dispensers are compact and space-efficient,fitting seamlessly into kitchens and office breakrooms.The slim design complements modern interiors without monopolizing countertops, adding convenience without sacrificing aesthetics.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions is important in helping customers make informed purchase decisions.

**How often do I need to change the filter?**
filter replacement frequency depends on water usage and water quality. Generally, filters need to be replaced every 3-6 months. Many units feature a filter indicator light as well that notifies the user when a new filter needs to be installed.

**Can I use tap water or do I need to use filtered water to fill the reservoir?**
You can use tap water,but it's recommended that you use tap water that is clear and free of excess sediment.The internal filtration system is designed to purify tap water, but heavily contaminated water might shorten the filter life and affect the water quality. Using filtered tap water, especially if you know your local water has issues, will only improve the taste and longevity of the machine.

**Are Keurig water dispensers energy-efficient?**
Keurig water dispensers are designed with energy efficiency in mind. Advanced models have standby modes that significantly reduce power consumption when not in use. Look for models with an Energy Star rating for optimal energy savings but generally, Keurig water dispensers are considered less energy consumptive than constant-heat water heaters or traditional coolers.

**What are the dimensions and weight of a typical Keurig water dispenser?**
The dimensions can vary depending on the model, but most Keurig water dispensers are designed to be compact. Typically, they range from 12-15 inches in height, 10-12 inches in width, and 14-16 inches in depth. The weight usually falls between 10-15 pounds when empty, but can weigh significantly more when the reservoir is filled. Be sure to check the product specifications for the exact dimensions and weight before purchasing.

1ksjis7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1ksjis7/my_guide_to_getting_a_518_from_about_3_months_of/,My guide to getting a 518 from about 3 months of full time studying,"* About This Guide
   * As I write this guide, I realize that there are some caveats I‚Äôd like to highlight for the reader. The most prominent one being that I took the MCAT in the summer after my second-year of university in neuroscience. This gave me a significant background in biology, psychology, and biochem/ chemistry. Therefore these sections did not require as much time for me as someone from a different academic background.¬†
   * Secondly, I was fortunate enough to be able to dedicate three months to this exam while only working part-time. In the end the MCAT is a marathon that simply requires consistent effort over time. Having the time to dedicate to exam prep is half the task.
   * Lastly, This guide is based on my experience and that of a handful of my peers. Therefore our experience is not necessarily representative of the majority of folks. That said, I have tried my best to create this guide with best practices and routines that helped us all score in the top 5th percentile (518 - 523)
   * This reddit page has been such a blessing! Thank you for answering all my questions and giving me a sense of community.



* Timeline
   * I spent three months full-time studying for the MCAT. I took a 2-week break after the end of the final exam season at the end of my sophomore (second) year (highly recommend this if you are doing exams before diving into the MCAT). My full-time prep started in mid-May and I took the MCAT in mid-August.
   * I spent the first half reviewing content and the second half doing practice questions and using an error-based review system.¬†
   * I bought the AAMC practice package a month before I took the exam. This was likely too late and If I could go back, I would buy the AAMC package at least 1.5 months before the exam to ensure that I had completed and reviewed all practice questions well before exam day.¬†



* ***Resources Used***
   * AAMC materials ($) (reserve for last month / 1.5 months)
      * Comes with 5 full-lengths and many practice question banks
      * Absolutely necessary purchase for a high score
   * Kaplan MCAT prep books ($)
      * Help with content review and referencing¬†
      * In-depth explanations of most concepts
      * Comes with a full-length and practice questions per unit
   * U uaorlld ($)
      * CARS passages (10 - 30% harder than AAMC)
      * P/S much more practice than AAMC
      * C/P + B/B about the same as AAMC
   * Anki: *ANKING****,*** Jack Sparrow, *Mr. Pankow (good for P/S)*
      * *YT: ANKING >>*¬†
      * Anki can help quickly memorize concepts and repeatedly reinforce them over a long period of time
      * The Jack Sparrow deck was likely too detailed
      * I used the anking deck for hard-to-memorize B/B + C/P facts and equations.
   * Jack Westin
      * JW CARS passages are extremely unpredictable in difficulty
      * Very good explanations for challenging topics (B/B & C/P)
      * If you‚Äôre struggling with a question, it‚Äôs likely that many people before you have as well. JW has answered most MCAT questions with detailed explanations.
   * R/MCAT (reddit) (take everything with a pinch of salt, can be helpful/ toxic depending on how you use it)
   * AAMC MCAT diagnostic (great tool to see where you are before you begin)
   * Third party full length exams
      * Most are notoriously harsh in grading
      * I saw a 10+ point difference a week apart between princeton review & AAMC
      * Highly recommend you take the BLUEPRINT free full length



* Individual section tips:

* Chem/ Phys: C/P
   * Highly application based: Practice is the name of the game in this section
   * Lately O-Chem seems to be more heavily tested than the expected numbers in the Kaplan books
   * Physics is contrarily underrepresented
   * Timing can be hard for some people in the section
   * U World followed by AAMC practice questions is likely best practice.¬†
      * Make sure to leave yourself enough time to complete all AAMC questions.
   * Use the Kaplan summary sheets to review high yield equations/ trends day before the exam
   * You may also use Anki to reinforce memory of equations
   * The Math involved is fairly simple with most calculations doable on scrap paper or mental math
   * Highest Yield: questions that pertain to the units of equations. Not regurgitation but application of many inter-linked concepts. For instance how Work (W) relates to Force (F) over Distance (D) but can also be calculated in terms of Power and Time¬†



* CARS
   * CARS is a beast. Tackle it early and practice questions regularly
   * I spent the first hour of each day going through¬† 3 - 4 passages in the morning when my mind was ready to do cognitively-taxing work.
   * I completed the entire U world CARS question bank and then did the AAMC practice questions, followed by AAMC Volume 2 of the bank and then AAMC Volume 1
   * Volume 2 and practice questions are likely the most representative of difficulty
   * Volume 1 (caveat: challenging and outdated)
      * Not as representative of what you can expect to see on the actual MCAT.
   * Note: go over the videos on the AAMC site at the beginning of the CARS practice bank. Very helpful in figuring out the thought process necessary for this section.

* With CARS, attempt to eliminate your personal biases / pre-conceived notions about the passage topic. Your aim is to best understand what the author‚Äôs perspective is on the given topic. What tone do they choose? What‚Äôs the big picture point of the whole passage? What is the point of a give paragraph or a given sentence?
* Highlight:Use this tool to your advantage by highlighting key names, dates, and terms used. This will make referencing the passage easier when answering questions.



* Biol/Biochem: B/B
   * Memorization + Practice questions required
   * U world + AAMC
   * Rewrite important pathways/ terms that you are struggling with
   * Use Anki to reinforce terms & content
   * More application based than most university biology courses
   * Heavy emphasis on scientific thinking and data interpretation

   * I followed the advice in the med school insiders blog below and front-loaded most of the content in the last week before the exam.¬†
   * I did however read through the 86 page doc at the beginning of the summer and completed all U world P/S material a month before the exam¬†
   * I continued to update my error correction notebook. This served as an amazing resource the day before the exam.¬†

* ***Study tips***
   * How to review practice questions
      * Create 3 **error correction notebooks** each for C/P, B/B, & P/S
      * In each notebook write down questions you got wrong along with an explanation for the right answer and what led you to pick the incorrect option.
      * Reviewing your practice questions is perhaps just as important if not more than doing the practice questions.
      * Review all questions you attempt. The one you got wrong take priority but also spend time reviewing what you got right. Sometimes we can make good guesses but that dosen‚Äôt necessarily mean that our understanding of the underlying concepts is strong.
   * CARS
      * Between passages take a brain break (30s max)¬†
      * Eliminate the obvious incorrect choices using strikethrough tool
      * narrow down to 50:50
      * CARS is the most time intensive section on the MCAT
   * Error correction: read ALL explanations
   * Convince yourself into being interested in the passage
      * View this as an opportunity to briefly dive into a niche¬†
   * Let go of your presuppositions and try to parse out the author‚Äôs intent in the text





* ***Mindset tips: prep + Day of the exam***
   * Your primary responsibility on the day leading up to the exam is to be well rested.
   * The day before the exam I actively read through most of my error-correction notebooks for C/P, B/B, & P/S. Having my weak areas in my working memory definitely helped with P/S.
   * Use regular Nutrition, Sleep, & Exercise to maximize cognitive capacity
      * There is no right answer here but stay consistent in the weeks leading up to the exam
      * Treat every practice exam like the real deal and eat, drink, wake up at the same time as you would do on the day of the exam.¬†
      * Try to eat similar foods that you can take inside the exam hall
      * My routine every Saturday in the last month looked something like this:
      * 6 AM - 7:30 AM: Wake up + quick jog to get the blood flowing + Breakfast (high protein, carb + Coffee)¬† (low fat, sugar, and fiber)
      * 7: 30 AM: commute to library
      * 8:00 AM: start the exam
      * After the exam rest and recover
      * Review the entire exam on Sunday

1ksjigf,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ksjigf/how_to_interact_with_a_bipolar_woman_as_an/,How to interact with a bipolar woman as an autistic man?,"I have been interested in a female acquaintance for a few years. She is smart, beautiful, kind, brave, and more fascinating as time goes on. Animals come up to her like Snow White. She‚Äôs like a magnet- men flirt with her constantly, she charms everyone, I hear people talk about how cool she is all the time when she is not around. She speaks her mind to everyone, and somehow everyone loves her for it (unlike me, for some reason). Very emotive. She is caring and is also aware of and specifically inclusive towards autistic people. With every person, she asks directly what they want or why they do things, and tells the truth, but again people seem to love her for it. Everyone says she is weird but it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter. She also clearly does not care what people think and gets openly irritated with people, and they still like her. Though a few people have said they get a vibe that she shouldn‚Äôt be messed with.

I‚Äôve always felt a connection to her but I never can predict how she will react with me. I feel like I always get it wrong. Sometimes it‚Äôs interesting but it‚Äôs getting frustrating. I have a really hard time scripting out conversations because she doesn‚Äôt get hints, sometimes she goes off on tangents, sometimes she acts strangely. I noticed that she will often tell people why she is acting a certain way and how she is feeling, but that those two things are the opposite. For example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being extra friendly because actually I‚Äôm in a bad mood and don‚Äôt want people to take it personally, so please leave me alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not drinking coffee right now so my brain hasn‚Äôt woken up, but I have a ton of energy. I can‚Äôt talk about complex things right now.‚Äù She is confident but gets very nervous. She seems to flirt but is shocked when people think she is coming onto them. She stomps around and acts surprised people think she‚Äôs angry.

She also can be very intense in a way that overwhelms me. She is not patient with emotional matters- her emotions are fast and big and she has no problem expressing and talking about how she feels. She often pushes me for answers because she cannot let something go until it‚Äôs openly and bluntly stated. She will say she wants something but change her mind. She will make plans and be excited then be quiet and shy day of. She will say she likes me, then not pay much attention to me when I‚Äôm around.

I started to get suspicious of her. Then I overheard her tell a friend she has bipolar. She is on medication and goes to therapy and has a workbook that helps her work through her feelings. That explained a lot. I started to do research on bipolar. But there is not too much known about it and it‚Äôs all confusing and contradictory. It sounds scary for everyone involved and painful for the person. It is technically neurodivergence. It seems to be neurodivergence of emotion rather than social function. Larger spectrum of emotions than normal humans. How can anyone explain what that is like if we don‚Äôt have words for it? It‚Äôs like explaining a color that is naked to the human eye. I am at a loss for how to understand her now. And I am a little afraid of her and afraid for her.

Maybe she understands what it is like to have a brain that is different and feel alone. But maybe I am the worst person for her to be around. I can‚Äôt even understand neurotypicals‚Äô emotions.

Does anyone have any advice on how I should act or approach our relationship- as friends or otherwise? Does anyone have experience with bipolar friends or family?",1,1747893596.0,autism,1,1.0,False

Dante gave her a gentle squeeze, a steadying presence amid the swirl of her pain. ‚ÄúHonestly,‚Äù he said, voice low and full of reluctant truth, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not much to go on.

He squeezed her shoulder again. Gentle. Unflinching. Warm. It should‚Äôve burned, it should've made her flinch. In truth, it did just not physically, but in the way that unexpected goodness always did when it was pointed inward instead of out. It was the kind of contact designed to soothe. The kind meant to heal. She listened as he spoke. Carefully. Not to his words, but to the shape they made in his soul. He believed. Every word. And not just believed in a higher power; he wanted to protect her from the shame of a truthless world.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs random,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo pattern.‚Äù
 Of course he thought that. That‚Äôs how the world broke people like him; not with monsters, but with meaninglessness. She let the pause stretch. Then drew in a shaky breath, half broken. She stared forward, the words hurt just to think, like they were fighting their way out from under trauma‚Äôs chokehold. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think there was a name,‚Äù she whispered, letting her voice falter. She didn‚Äôt look at him. That would feel performative. Instead, she closed her eyes, brows knitting in that perfect balance of fear and traumatic memory. ‚ÄúSomething fell out of his wallet when he grabbed me. A card or maybe his ID, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù A breathless shrug. ‚ÄúI....I didn‚Äôt read it, not really. I just saw the letters.‚Äù Then the pause. ‚ÄúD‚Ä¶ R‚Ä¶ O‚Ä¶ U‚Ä¶I think there was an ‚ÄòI‚Äô?

He called the police. Not just threatened it not just mentioned it but actually called. And? He meant it. Aspen felt the stir of panic, where every human kept their instincts, low in the spine, where emotions writhed and rattled against their leash. The idea of uniforms arriving, of questions being asked, of reports being filed with real names and blood under her fingernails. She had counted on the priest‚Äôs empathy. But not his functionality. Most men like him wanted to hold broken things, not hand them over to process. But Dante Reyes? He wanted justice. And justice could be messy. His phone clicked shut and he turned to her, eyes full of soft resolve, the kind that couldn't be manipulated with sob stories or fragility alone. He was already preparing to retrace her steps. Already visualizing a roadside, a wallet, a predator hiding in the dark. She couldn‚Äôt stop him, not when he was still so warm, so open. She brought her hands to her face, rubbed the grit beneath her eyes like tears. When she looked up, her expression was cracked open, raw but trying to be brave. The survivor trying to help. Give him what he wants. Feed the need to save even as it put her in danger of the predator getting a chance to act. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ it was right past that billboard with the faded soda ad? Maybe a mile down. There‚Äôs that little gravel pull-off; he forced the car over there.‚Äù Her voice caught. She twisted her fingers together, curling in slightly like the memory was pressing down on her ribs. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even mean to grab the wallet it just hit the floor when he shoved me. I didn‚Äôt think. I just ran.‚Äù She sniffed, once. Not too much. No theatrics now just trembling honesty, smeared with fatigue. She saw the way he responded to that. The way he listened. Not just heard. Listened. @Dante Reyes

Dante nodded in quiet understanding just as Luis returned, his arms full with towels and a modest stack of donated clothes. ‚ÄúLuis,‚Äù Dante said, turning toward him, ‚Äúgo wake up Father Jack. Tell him not to bother getting dressed‚Äîhis pajamas are fine. He should be able to go back to sleep in a few minutes, but I need him out here now.‚Äù Under normal circumstances, Dante wouldn‚Äôt have disturbed Jack‚Äôs rest. But tonight wasn‚Äôt normal. That thing had known his name. It had spoken with intent. And that meant it could come back. Maybe not for him‚Äîbut for the boys. He had to be sure they weren‚Äôt left defenseless, not even for a moment. The demon feared the Word of God. And Jack‚Äîfaithful, unshakable Jack‚Äîcould speak it even half-asleep, with the conviction of a man born to preach it. That was enough. Dante gave Aspen‚Äôs shoulder another gentle squeeze, grounding her in the moment. ‚ÄúYou can trust Jack,‚Äù he said, his voice low and steady. ‚ÄúMet him when he was still in high school during an outreach. He‚Äôs a good man. You‚Äôll be in safe hands.‚Äù Without another word, Dante turned. The old keys were already clutched in his hand, jingling softly as he made his way to the parking lot. The church doors whispered shut behind him. He slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, grabbed the high-powered flashlight from the passenger side, and started the engine. The tires kissed the road, and he was gone‚Äîracing through the quiet streets toward the highway sign @Staff

The church doors whispered shut behind them. She didn‚Äôt wait. The moment Dante was on his feet, Aspen stood. She forced herself to stumble with him as he rushed her elbow grazing the pew, a faint hiss of pain. But she didn‚Äôt give either of them time. She was already moving at his side, the panic in her eyes did the work. Dante saw her fragile. Barefoot. Arms wrapped around herself like the air had turned sharp. She moved with him, chest heaving slightly, one hand pressed flat to her stomach like she was physically trying to hold herself together. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she said, barely louder than the engine‚Äôs idle. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me here. Not tonight. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice cracked, and she bit down on the rest. ‚ÄúI know, I know, I should stay, and I‚Äôm probably in shock, and you want to do what‚Äôs right. I get it. But I can‚Äôt be alone again. Not in another room with new faces. Not with a stranger. Not after‚Ä¶‚Äù She let the sentence hang like a snapped noose. Her hands trembled. Not for effect. Not because she was scared of Jack, or Luis, or even being alone. But due some ephemeral otherness to the trauma she'd experienced and Dante was attempting to inflict on her again. And that was worse. ‚ÄúPlease, Father. Just‚Ä¶ let me sit in the back. I won‚Äôt talk. I won‚Äôt get in the way. I just‚Ä¶ I need to know you‚Äôre there. That someone‚Äôs driving away from where it happened, not toward it. I need that.‚Äù She blinked up at him. Eyes glassy. Breath hitching. It was a hard ask, she knew. And she also knew exactly it was the only right choice. Because he couldn‚Äôt say no. Not without breaking something in himself. And juts like that his tires kissed the road, and they were gone from the hallowed grounds of St Alphonsus, racing through the quiet streets toward the highway sign. @Dante Reyes

Dante gripped the wheel tighter as the car carved through the dark streets of Gulfport, headlights slicing through the silence. The engine hummed beneath them, steady like a heartbeat. He didn‚Äôt look at her right away. Instead, his eyes stayed on the road ahead, like the words needed to form in the dark before they could be spoken. ‚ÄúYou know Psalm 23?‚Äù he asked softly. ‚ÄúIt saved me once.‚Äù His voice had weight. Not dramatic‚Äîbut worn. Lived-in. Real. ‚ÄúI still remember it like it was hours ago. That night‚Ä¶‚Äù He let out a slow breath through his nose. ‚ÄúThe world felt smothered in darkness. Not just night, but something thicker. Heavier. And I was alone‚Äîso alone, my footsteps echoed like gunshots. Every shadow moved. Every sound was a whisper of something watching. I thought if I stopped moving, even once, I‚Äôd break.‚Äù He paused at a red light. The city was asleep. Only the hum of the streetlights and the occasional dog bark in the distance marked that the world still turned. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt stop,‚Äù he continued, voice low and sure. ‚ÄúI walked forward, even when everything inside me begged me to run. I prayed. I prayed Psalm 23 with every piece of my soul. And do you know what happened?‚Äù Now he looked at her, just briefly‚Äîlong enough for her to see the memory still lived behind his eyes. ‚ÄúThe darkness cracked. The fear peeled away. Whatever was out there‚Äîit fled. Because God was there. In the silence. In the fear. In me.‚Äù He turned back to the road, gears shifting smoothly as they picked up speed again. ‚ÄúCourage isn‚Äôt never being afraid, mija. Courage is walking forward anyway. And you did that. You survived hell and still found your way to holy ground. That‚Äôs strength. That‚Äôs real strength. And don‚Äôt let anyone‚Äîincluding yourself‚Äîtell you otherwise.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt expect a reply. He just let the words settle in the air like incense, holy and lingering.

She stayed quiet after he finished, like the words had wrapped around her spine and held her upright. Her breath was softer now. No more gasps, just the slow kind of inhale people took when they were trying not to cry or maybe trying not to feel too much at all. The silence between them wasn‚Äôt awkward. It was reverent. Like a hymn after the benediction, carried on the engine‚Äôs hum and the quiet rhythm of the tires meeting asphalt. He didn‚Äôt look at her again. He didn‚Äôt need to. That was the thing about good men. You only had to show them the wound. The rest, they did themselves. She leaned her head against the window, bare shoulder trembling faintly in the reflection, and let her eyes fall shut. A perfect silhouette of survival. Of grace barely held together. Of the girl too fragile to break again. And still, she waited. Not long. Just enough. The city thinned around them, streetlights falling away like dying candles. Beyond them stretched the road, empty, long, edged by pine trees and the whisper of swamp-dark water. The last red light was a distant memory now. That‚Äôs when she moved. Slow. Purposeful. A shift in the dark like a cat rising from a crouch. She leaned forward between the seats, voice warm and low, breath ghosting the edge of his ear like a benediction or a kiss. ‚ÄúBut courage,‚Äù she murmured, ‚Äúcan make a man careless.‚Äù She let the words hang. Just long enough to stiffen the air between them. ‚ÄúAnd you were so busy saving me,‚Äù Aspen whispered, ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt stop to wonder why someone like me would be barefoot‚Ä¶ running from a church.‚Äù
Her hand touched his shoulder. Not tender. Anchored. Possessive. ‚ÄúYou felt it back there, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asked softly. ‚ÄúSomething in me. Something old. And beautiful. And broken. You thought it was pain. You thought it was faith. But really‚Ä¶ it was hunger.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt bare her fangs yet. She didn‚Äôt need to. She simply sat back in her seat like nothing had changed. But something had. The space between them crackled with that unnatural stillness, the pause before the pounce. ‚ÄúTell me, Father‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, the word Father curling off her tongue like a joke only she understood, ‚ÄúDid your Psalm say anything about the valley‚Äôs teeth?‚Äù Her reflection in the window smiled. A little too wide. And behind them, the lights of Gulfport disappeared in the rearview mirror, along with any road back to salvation. The moment her voice broke the veil, Dante‚Äôs fingers tightened on the wheel. She felt it, the shudder running down his spine. A man of God, still tethered to hope even as the darkness wrapped its arms around him. He eased the car to the side of the road, gravel crunching beneath the tires. The engine idled low, like a held breath. Then silence. He turned to look at her. His face wasn‚Äôt afraid. Not yet. There was sorrow there. Confusion. That desperate human need to believe someone could still be saved. Even now, he was looking for the broken girl. And in that moment, she smiled. The kind of smile that didn‚Äôt belong on anything human. Aspen slid her legs out of the seat, bare feet settling on the floorboard. She straightened slowly, hands resting in her lap. No violence. Not yet. Only inevitability. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have looked back,‚Äù she said. And then the change came. Her skin split like wet parchment. Muscle writhed. Bone twisted. Her body unfolded, not grew, but reclaimed something older, primal, obscene. Flesh peeled back in ribbons of gristle and hunger. Her eyes remained‚Äîsharp, mocking, present, as a monstrous visage emerged: spiked limbs, exposed ribs
like fingers grasping inward, a grin that stretched far past anatomy. Vicissitude wasn‚Äôt just transformation. It was violation. Dante stumbled back, one hand flying instinctively to the crucifix around his neck. He opened his mouth, maybe to scream, maybe to pray. But she spoke over him, her voice now a guttural, resonant echo that shook the windshield. ‚ÄúPray that you perish, Father.‚Äù Her wings of stretched flesh rose behind her like a cathedral burning in reverse. ‚ÄúFor what comes next‚Ä¶‚Äù Her head cocked slowly, reverently. ‚Äú‚Ä¶is worse than the hell you‚Äôve been taught to fear.‚Äù And then she moved. Fast. Not like a predator, but like a god grown tired of patience.

As she attacked, Dante didn‚Äôt flinch. He didn‚Äôt have time to. He didn‚Äôt transform‚Äînot like she had. But something in him shifted, all the same. The years spent in seminary, the quiet prayers and rituals, fell away like old robes. What rose in their place wasn‚Äôt Father Dante. It was the boy who‚Äôd grown up fighting on cracked sidewalks. The soldier forged in back-alley brawls and hard lessons. The man who knew how to survive. The keys around his neck burned‚Äînot from heat, but from faith. Unshakable. Untouched by her terror. His hands clenched into fists, not out of fear, but instinct. He didn‚Äôt hesitate. Didn‚Äôt even think. He moved with the kind of muscle memory that didn‚Äôt ask permission. He fought. And even as he swung, even as her monstrous form loomed, he shouted‚Äînot in fear, but with the voice of the pulpit, the street, and the battlefield all at once. ‚ÄúJohn 3:16!‚Äù he roared. ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life!‚Äù His voice was thunder. Not a plea, but a declaration. ‚ÄúThat includes monsters like you And monsters like me.‚Äù He locked eyes with what was left of her. The girl. The thing. Whatever she was now. ‚ÄúRepent, my daughter,‚Äù he growled, breath ragged. ‚ÄúI beg you‚Äîlet the love of God in.‚Äù The crucifix caught the moonlight. ‚ÄúOr be damned.‚Äù

And damned as damned can be ... incensed with a fury instead of the natural and all too relevant fear Dante surged forward into the maw of madness that was the savage unreal horrid form the girl had taken.
She did not lunge. She descended. Her form no longer the bruised girl in rags had become a cathedral of flesh, sculpted by madness and something far older than cruelty. Skin sloughed from her bones like paper soaked in bile, reshaping itself into blades and horrors not meant for eyes to behold. Her ribs cracked open like wings, teeth spiraling inward, every step a wet symphony of tearing muscle and creaking cartilage. And still Dante did not run. He should have. God help him, he should have. But his hands clenched around the crucifix. His breath was ragged, his body already bleeding, but he did not flee. Because someone had to stand. He struck first. A brawler‚Äôs blow, wild but grounded in years of bruised knuckles and midnight street fights. His fist collided with her midsection, landing with a sickening crunch. Bone cracked. Black ichor spilled. And she smiled. It did not stop her. It delighted her. She answered with a strike of her own spikes driven straight through his abdomen, two of them, like fangs birthed from her wrists. They slid into his belly slowly, not from hesitation but control. Like she was feeling his heat on the way in. Dante gasped. It wasn‚Äôt a scream. It was prayer strangled by pain. He tried to speak, to quote scripture but blood filled his mouth before the words could come. He dropped to one knee. ""Get up. Get up, you son of God. Get up before she kills again.""He heard over and over in his own head in his own voice. And so... He did. God help him, he stood again.

Aspen circled him, her inhuman legs slicing through gravel like blades. Her voice now came from everywhere from her mouth, from the seams in her chest, from the glistening wet orifice curled behind her jaw like a second tongue. ‚ÄúDo you feel holy now?‚Äù she whispered. And she struck again. Her claws tore through his thigh, the femoral artery bursting like a pipe under pressure. Hot blood sprayed across her neck, and she laughed not a shriek, but a low, gurgling thing, erotic in its cruelty. Dante fell a second time. He didn‚Äôt cry out. But his hands shook, one clawing through dirt, the other gripping the crucifix as if it could somehow root him to life. The pain was not sharp anymore. It was everywhere. Like a second skin made of fire. His body was slipping away. Fast. Too fast. But still, he rose again. Because he believed if he didn‚Äôt, she would go back. Back to the boys. Back to the church. Back to the innocent. And no one else would be there to stop her. The third blow ended him. It came not with fury, but with precision a single, elegant motion. Her arm snaked around his chest, talons plunging between his ribs. One pierced his lung. Another his spine. His legs failed instantly. He remained standing only because she held him there, like a puppet. He coughed. Blood and saliva spilled down his chin. He turned his head not to her, but to the sky, to the stars. There were none. Just black. Just silence. Just the slow understanding of the ultimate abandonment. He thought of Luis. He thought of Ricky. He thought of the chapel walls and the prayers still hanging in the rafters, unanswered. No angels came. No wrath split the skies. No hand reached down to stop this. The crucifix slipped from his hand, landing in the dirt with a dull, soft thud.
She released him, and he fell not like a man, but like a tower felled from within. He hit the earth hard. Hard enough to bounce once. He gasped, not for breath there was none left but because the body clings to life long after the soul gives up. He stared at the sky, choking. His fingers curled around gravel and blood-soaked leaves. The last thing he heard wasn‚Äôt her voice. It was his own, inside his head, quiet now. Tired. You stood. But it wasn‚Äôt enough. His vision dimmed. The Lady of Guadalupe, silent. The sanctuary, undefended. His flock, unguarded. And then, painlessly‚Ä¶ He was no longer there. The roadside was quiet. Aspen knelt beside his body, her monstrous form slowly receding. Skin knitting. Bones folding inward. Her eyes still human, stared down at him. Not with pity. With curiosity that was becoming rage. ‚ÄúYou really thought ...‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶ beautiful.‚Äù She rose. And left him in the dirt. No cross. No burial. No final rite. Just blood cooling on the gravel. And a broken body where faith stood too long.

 ... Saturday September 30 Death
The earth was a suffocating shroud, its weight pressing down with the finality of a tombstone. Damp soil invaded every crevice, a cold, unyielding embrace that mocked the warmth of life. Each breath was a struggle, a desperate gasp against the oppressive silence of the grave. The scent of decay and dampness filled the nostrils, a pungent reminder of mortality. Limbs, once agile and strong, now felt like leaden weights, bound by the cloying grip of the earth. The darkness was absolute, a void that swallowed all sense of time and self. Above, Saint Alphonsus stood as a sentinel of bygone eras, its Gothic spires piercing the sky like skeletal fingers reaching for salvation. Constructed in 1874, the church bore the weight of history, its walls steeped in tales of devotion and despair. The red brick fa√ßade, weathered by time, exuded a somber dignity, while the stained-glass windows cast fragmented hues upon the worn pews within. Inside, the air was thick with incense and whispered prayers, the silence broken only by the creaking of ancient wood and the distant tolling of bells. The altar, adorned with flickering candles, stood as a beacon amidst the shadows, its presence both comforting and foreboding. As Dante clawed his way from the grave, the world above remained oblivious to his resurrection. The church, with its solemn grandeur, bore silent witness to the blasphemy unfolding beneath its sacred grounds. The once-hallowed halls now echoed with the unspoken horrors of the past, each stone a testament to the sins buried within. The very air seemed to recoil, heavy with the weight of secrets too dark to be spoken aloud. In this place where the divine met the profane, Dante's return was not a miracle, but a curse a chilling reminder that some souls are never truly at rest. @Dante Reyes

Dante brushed the dirt off himself, grime clinging to his skin like the memory of the grave. Every step was a test of will, pain burning through his limbs as he limped toward home. ""That bitch is going to pay,"" he muttered, voice low and raw. Bloodied, starving, and half-dead, he finally reached the front door of his house. With effort, he shoved it open and stumbled inside. The silence greeted him like an old friend. He didn‚Äôt stop to think‚Äîhe needed a shower, and more than that, he needed to eat. Desperation gnawed at his insides. He was starving. @Staff

 The dirt clung to him like memory. Not like soil, feeling like an amniotic caul by way of bearing witness. It filled his ears until all sound was muffled, a wet pressure behind the drums. It jammed into his nostrils, thick and gritty, as though it were trying to root itself inside him, to finish what last night had started. Red red cake like granules packed into his eyelids, scraping against his corneas every time he blinked. His mouth tasted of iron and rot, soil matted with the wasted fluids of his life; not fresh, but stale, like it had waited for days to dry inside him. His nails were a black that was indescribably red like all things Mississippian soil. He was filthy with it, it was wedged deep, torn from his clawing escape. And beneath that dirt were wounds that no longer bled, only wept open aired pain. Every motion sent small avalanches of grime falling from his skin, from his hair, from the folds of his clothing. Yet somehow, more remained, woven into him, as if the grave had stitched itself into his flesh before letting him go. He couldn‚Äôt hear properly. He couldn‚Äôt smell anything but the decay. He'd stumbled forward like a drunken saint, fingers trailing the hallway walls of his home, the once-sacred space now unfamiliar; too quiet, too clean. Like it hadn‚Äôt expected him to return. And maybe it hadn‚Äôt. Because if being honest even he didn‚Äôt know what had returned.
st ‚Äî 5/13/25, 8:51 PM
The shower hissed to life, too hot. The water blasted dirt loose in chunks, revealing pale, bruised flesh beneath. He stepped under it still half-dressed, and the water turned black as it circled the drain, like oil washing off a rusted machine. He did not cry. He held his anger deep and to core of him. If he were honest he would admit that anger was replacing the religion in him. Rage his holy hymn. Violation of his sense of self revealing the truth of his being. Religion was easy as it was his way to continue fighting. Holding it in absence of a target proved how waning it always had been. And so he shivered. Not from cold, which he was, but from the memory of what happened. From the realization that whatever pain came next, he had already known the worst. Or so he thought. He didn‚Äôt hear the door open. Didn‚Äôt see the movement behind the curtain. Was blind to everything save his vision of anger as filthy as the soil trailing from him. Only when arms wrapped around him from behind strong, slender, uninvited did he react, his unbeating heart jerking into overdrive. ‚ÄúShhh‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe voice was honey over broken glass. Aspen. Not the monster. Not the beast. The girl. Or the thing that wore her shape. She pressed herself against him, the space between their bodies too close, the heat of the water amplifying every contact point: her chest against his spine, her hands against his ribs, her cheek brushing his shoulder. The stall was too small for one. With two? It became a cell. Dante temporarily frozen, from a sudden surge of want that did not belong to him. Her presence, soaked in the false comfort of closeness, was not sexual but consumptive. Her arms weren‚Äôt caressing. They were holding. Claiming. As if wrapping around something already hers. And the worst part? His soul, his self he wanted to lean back into her. he as horrible as it felt to know understood she would keep him... safe. And somewhere his voice whispered as hymn he heard... This is safety. This is origin

Dante moved to elbow her in the face‚Äîbut instead, for a brief, unthinking second, he leaned against her. The closeness snapped him back, and realization flooded him. He recoiled with a growl, thick with anger and disgust. Without a word, he turned off the water, grabbed a towel, and threw it in her direction without even looking. He dressed quickly‚Äîblack slacks, a long-sleeved shirt, and his Roman collar. The priest was back. Limping heavily, he made his way to the kitchen. ‚ÄúGet dressed,‚Äù he muttered over his shoulder. ‚ÄúAfter I get some food and coffee in me, we can finish our little fight to the death.‚Äù He slammed the bathroom door behind him. In the kitchen, Dante started the coffee pot and began making breakfast tacos. The motions were second nature‚Äîcrack the eggs, warm the tortillas, add the sausage. When it was ready, he set two plates at the table and poured two cups of coffee. Sitting down with a quiet grunt, he doused his taco in hot sauce and took a bite, chewing slowly as if the act alone could ground him. The silence stretched, thick with tension. But for now, he had to eat. @Staff

Dante squeezed the phone until it crumpled like foil in his hand, the plastic casing cracking with a sharp snap.

""Shut up."" Aspen said with a sigh. His voice thundered with rage pure, uncut, righteous. The kind that echoed through pulpits and cracked through centuries of stained glass. The phone shattered. The table split beneath his fist. And Aspen? She didn‚Äôt flinch. No. She blinked once. Slowly. Like she were watching a storm break against a cliff beautiful in its futility. Then she leaned forward across the ruined table, elbows on the jagged edge as if it were a caf√© counter, her chin resting on laced fingers. She looked at him with something like affection‚Ä¶ and a whole lot like disappointment. ‚ÄúDante,‚Äù she said softly. Not mockingly no, worse. Intimately. Like she‚Äôd said it a hundred times already. Like it belonged to her. ‚ÄúYou really are exhausting.‚Äù She stood then. Slowly. Her movements languid, almost feline. One step. Then another. Her bare feet silent on the cold tile. No theatrics. No fangs. Just presence. Dense and suffocating. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still clinging to all the wrong things,‚Äù she murmured, circling behind him. ‚ÄúYou think this world is divided into monsters and saints. You think what happened in that grave, in that car, in me... is evil.‚Äù Her fingers brushed the back of his collar. ‚ÄúBut Dante‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered, lips close now, her breath cool against the base of his neck. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs evil‚Ä¶ is pretending you‚Äôre not already like us.‚Äù She paused then pressed her cheek against his, tenderly, revoltingly close. The contact wasn‚Äôt sexual. It was claiming. Like a predator scent-marking a kill. ‚ÄúYou died,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThe moment you stood still. When you walked into that forest. When you bled out with Scripture on your lips. That was beautiful, you know. I would‚Äôve wept if I could.‚Äù Her hand splayed flat across his chest over his unbeating heart. ‚ÄúI had plans for you,‚Äù Aspen sighed. ‚ÄúReal ones. I thought maybe I could‚Ä¶ play with you a while. Teach you. Let you burn all the way down before building you back into something useful.‚Äù She leaned closer. The words now a whispe

Like velvet soaked in oil. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a priest anymore. You‚Äôre not even a man. You‚Äôre a corpse with conviction. And conviction...‚Äù she exhaled, amused, ‚Äúis such a fragile thing when you‚Äôre starving.‚Äù She drew back just a little, so he could see her expression when she finally said it. ‚ÄúYou want me, Dante. You hate it. You‚Äôd die again to deny it. But part of you knows I‚Äôm the only one who can make this make sense.‚Äù The bond thrummed. Not control. Not yet. But gravity. Emotional gravity. Like a weight around the soul that bent thoughts toward her like iron to a lodestone. She stepped around, stood before him. Then she smiled. ‚ÄúNow‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt you sit down‚Ä¶ and ask your new mommy lord and savior what comes next?‚Äù @Dante Reyes

 Aspen felt his hatred before he said a word like the heat rising off a scorched altar. That righteous fury. That pious defiance. That ridiculous, impossible refusal to break. And she was done with it. He glared at her like a man invoking saints while already nailed to the cross. So noble. So loud. So fundamentally stupid. Aspen didn't smile. She didn't taunt. Her voice didn‚Äôt rise. Instead, her anger grew cold the kind of cold that drowns people, not burns them. She pulled back just enough to look him fully in the face, her gaze devoid of pleasure now. No cooing, no flirtation. Just contempt. ‚Äú‚ÄòI have only one Master,‚Äô‚Äù she repeated quietly, as though tasting something bitter on her tongue. ‚ÄúIs that what you think this is?‚Äù She rose from his lap slowly, the command still binding him like barbed wire in his blood. Her fingers dragged down his chest not lovingly, but deliberately, tracing the lines of a broken relic. Her nails scraped over his collar. ‚ÄúYou think this is some holy trial? A test of faith? That your pain means anything?‚Äù She laughed. Not the seductive lilt she‚Äôd worn before, but something sharper. Harsher. The sound of glass breaking behind confession walls. ‚ÄúYou still think you matter.‚Äù
Her face twisted not with rage, but with disgusted disappointment. ‚ÄúI made you, Dante. I chose you. I poured eternity into your dying throat, and what did you do with it?‚Äù She leaned in, voice low and hissing. ‚ÄúYou sulked. You quoted scripture. You threatened me with Hell as if I hadn‚Äôt crawled out of worse things.‚Äù She pulled back sharply. ‚ÄúYou know what I hoped? That you‚Äôd crack. That you‚Äôd howl. That the thing you really are would snap its leash and show me something true. But instead‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúYou prayed.‚Äù She circled him now, like a vulture that‚Äôd grown bored with the kill. Her hands never touched him again‚Äîbut her presence was suffocating. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a man. You‚Äôre not a priest. You‚Äôre not even a monster. You‚Äôre a coward dressed in the skin of something righteous. So obsessed with purity, and while its obvious you‚Äôll die rather than become. I will offer you a choice. One singular choice to prove I either wasted my time or there is a reason for us to continue playing this game...‚Äù She stopped behind him. ‚ÄúYou may speak and answer honestly.

You know the one‚Äîwhere you've tried everything from drugstore finds to department store splurges, only to end up with a bathroom cabinet graveyard of half-used jars? If you're dealing with combination to dry skin, that search gets even trickier. Too heavy, and your T-zone turns into an oil slick by noon. Too light, and those dry patches start flaking before you've even finished your morning coffee. Well, my skincare-obsessed friend, I think I've found something worth chatting about: TATCHA The Silk Cream.

# What Makes TATCHA The Silk Cream Stand Out?

Have you ever used a product that made you audibly say ""wow"" the first time you tried it? That was me with The Silk Cream. But before I get carried away with my enthusiasm (and trust me, I could go on for hours), let's talk about what TATCHA actually is.

TATCHA was inspired by Japanese beauty rituals‚Äîspecifically, the skincare routines of geishas who are known for their flawless complexions despite wearing heavy makeup daily. The brand focuses on clean formulations based on traditional Japanese ingredients, and they've developed quite the cult following. And for good reason, IMO!

What makes The Silk Cream special is its unique texture. Despite being rich enough for dry skin, it has this incredible weightless feel that seems to defy logic. It's like the cashmere sweater of moisturizers‚Äîluxuriously soft and comfortable, but you barely notice you're wearing it.

The cream comes in a gorgeous purple jar (TATCHA's signature packaging is seriously display-worthy) and has a subtle, pleasant scent that isn't overpowering. At $120 for 1.7 oz, it's definitely an investment, but we'll get into whether it's worth the splurge later.

# The Science Behind The Silk Cream

# Key Ingredients

Let's break down what's actually in this fancy jar:

* **Hadasei-3‚Ñ¢ Complex** \- TATCHA's signature fermented blend of rice, algae, and green tea that's packed with antioxidants
* **Silk Extract** \- Helps retain moisture while creating a protective barrier
* **Squalane** \- A lightweight moisturizer that mimics skin's natural oils
* **Japanese White Peony** \- Helps control excess oil production
* **Akoya Pearl Extract** \- Contains amino acids that firm and brighten

# How It Works

The genius of this formulation is how it balances moisture and oil control. The silk extract creates something called a ""liquid silk network"" that holds moisture on the skin's surface without feeling heavy or greasy. Meanwhile, the Japanese White Peony helps regulate sebum production, which is particularly helpful for combination skin types who need hydration without adding oil.

What truly sets it apart is how the formula adapts to your skin's needs. On oilier areas, it provides hydration without adding shine, while on drier patches, it delivers deeper moisture. It's like having two moisturizers in one, which explains how it can work for both combination and dry skin types.

# My Personal Experience With The Silk Cream

When I first scooped out The Silk Cream, I was surprised by its texture‚Äîit looks rich in the jar but feels incredibly lightweight when applied. It glides onto skin like, well, silk (I know, so on-the-nose, but it's accurate!).

The first week was promising, but I've been burned before by products that start great and then cause breakouts. But two months in, and my skin has never looked better. My typically dry cheeks stay hydrated throughout the day, and my oily T-zone remains surprisingly balanced.

Ready to give it a try yourself? Check out [**The Silk Cream here**](https://amzn.to/43sZ796).

What really impressed me was how it worked under makeup. Many rich moisturizers cause foundation to slide off by midday, but The Silk Cream creates this perfect canvas that helps makeup stay put. I've literally had colleagues ask if I've ""done something different"" with my skin. (Yes, I finally found a moisturizer that actually works, Karen!)

# Who Should Use The Silk Cream?

This cream is ideal for:

* Combination skin types struggling with both oily and dry areas
* Dry skin that needs serious moisture without heaviness
* Mature skin seeking firming benefits alongside hydration
* Anyone dealing with seasonal dryness
* People who wear makeup and need a good base

Who might want to skip it:

* Very oily skin types (though TATCHA's Water Cream would be perfect for you)
* Those with sensitive skin that reacts to fragrance
* Budget-conscious skincare shoppers (it's definitely a luxury product)

**If your skin drinks up moisturizers like water in a desert**, this might be your holy grail. It provides lasting hydration that actually stays put instead of disappearing an hour after application.

# How To Use The Silk Cream For Best Results

The application makes a difference with premium products like this. Here's how to get your money's worth:

1. Apply to clean, toned skin (I like to use it after a hydrating essence)
2. Use the included spatula to scoop a pearl-sized amount
3. Warm the product between your fingertips for a few seconds
4. Press and gently massage into the skin, starting from the center of the face outward
5. Allow 1-2 minutes to fully absorb before applying sunscreen or makeup

# Pro Tips

A little goes a surprisingly long way with this cream. I made the rookie mistake of using too much at first‚Äîtrust me, a small amount provides plenty of hydration, and using more won't give you better results. In fact, using too much might make it feel heavier than it needs to be.

Ever noticed how your skin's needs change with the seasons? During winter months, I layer The Silk Cream over a hydrating serum for extra moisture. In summer, I sometimes skip the serum and just use the cream alone on slightly damp skin.

# How It Compares to Other Premium Moisturizers

Let's be real‚Äî$120 is serious money for a face cream. So how does it stack up against other luxury options?

**TATCHA The Silk Cream vs. La Mer Cr√®me de la Mer:** La Mer is nearly twice the price and feels much heavier on the skin. While both deliver serious hydration, The Silk Cream's weightless texture makes it more versatile and better for combination skin types. La Mer can sometimes feel like it's sitting on top of your skin, while The Silk Cream actually sinks in.

**TATCHA The Silk Cream vs. Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream:** Closer in price point, Drunk Elephant's offering focuses more on protein peptides for firming. It's slightly lighter than The Silk Cream but doesn't provide quite the same level of moisture for truly dry areas. Both are excellent, but The Silk Cream edges ahead for combo-to-dry skin types.

**TATCHA The Silk Cream vs. Sunday Riley C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream:** Sunday Riley focuses on brightening benefits alongside hydration. If your main concern is dullness, C.E.O. might be your pick. For pure hydration and balance, TATCHA wins. Also worth noting that some find Sunday Riley's citrus scent a bit strong, while TATCHA's is much more subtle.

# The Verdict: Is TATCHA The Silk Cream Worth It?

Look, I'm not going to pretend $120 for a moisturizer isn't expensive‚Äîit absolutely is. But if you're already spending money on multiple products trying to address both the dry and oily areas of your face, consolidating to one effective product might actually save you cash in the long run. :)

What you're really paying for is:

* A perfectly balanced formula that works for tricky combination-to-dry skin
* Long-lasting hydration that doesn't require constant reapplication
* Skincare that creates an ideal base for makeup
* Added benefits like firming and brightening

**The bottom line?** If your skin struggles with being both oily and dry and you've tried everything from ultra-lightweight gels (not enough moisture) to rich creams (too greasy), The Silk Cream might be the Goldilocks solution you've been searching for.

After three months of use, I'm officially a convert. My bathroom cabinet has been Marie Kondo'd of all the other ""almost right"" moisturizers, and this purple jar has earned its place front and center. My skin is more balanced, plump, and healthy-looking than it has been in years.

Have you tried anything from TATCHA before? The Silk Cream might be their crown jewel, but their entire line is pretty impressive. If you've been on the fence about splurging on this moisturizer, take this as your sign to treat yourself‚Äîyour skin will thank you, even if your wallet initially protests. And TBH, good skin is priceless. After all, it's the one outfit you never take off!",1,1747893227.0,TheBeautyCircle,0,1.0,False
1ksjemr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksjemr,Stock image generation for creatives ‚Äì Full Workflow,"# Stock image generation for Creatives - Workflow

# Overview

This n8n workflow system is composed of three integrated workflows:

1. Text Prompt Generator ‚Äì Generates high-quality, photorealistic prompts based on topics.
2. Adobe Stock for Creatives ‚Äì Uses those prompts to create images, analyze metadata, and upload final assets to Google Drive and Sheets.
3. Error Logger‚ÄîNotifies you via Telegram and logs any processing errors to a dedicated Google Sheet for monitoring and debugging.

Combined, they provide a powerful automation pipeline for AI-driven stock content generation.

# Key Technologies Used

* n8n for workflow automation
* Google Sheets for prompt, metadata, and error tracking
* Google Drive for asset storage
* OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) for prompt and metadata generation
* PIAPI for image generation
* Telegram for user notifications



# Workflow A: Text Prompt Generator

This is the initial workflow that runs daily at 4 AM to create fresh image prompts based on ideas.

# 1. Trigger

* Schedule Trigger: Executes every day at 4 AM.

# 2. Fetch Topic

* Google Sheets1: Retrieves the first topic marked as Created = NO from the ""Ideas"" sheet.

# 3. Prepare Prompt Generation

* Set Topic: Passes the topic as a variable for prompt generation.
* Create Loop Indexes: Creates an array of 50 to simulate multiple batch jobs (used for merging with prompts).

# 4. Generate Prompts

* Prompt Generator: Uses GPT-4o-mini with the instruction: Generate 20 unique, highly realistic, photorealistic image prompts based on the topic. Each prompt should describe a specific visual scene with concrete details like environment, lighting, perspective, colors, and objects. Return as a plain list. (Results per Run 1000 Prompts)

# 5. Post-process Prompts

* Split Prompts: Breaks the response into individual prompts.
* Merge Batches: Merges the prompts with loop index items.

# 6. Store Prompts

* Google Sheets2: Appends each prompt to the ""Generated Pmts"" sheet with Images created = NO.



# Workflow B: Adobe Stock for Creatives

This is the main execution workflow triggered every 3 minutes to process prompts and generate stock images.

# 1. Trigger & Initialization

* Schedule Trigger: Runs every 3 minutes.
* Set Date Info: Converts to your timezone and creates date strings.
* Filter Data Date: Prepares formatted values for naming folders/sheets.

# 2. Fetch Prompt

* Google Sheets: Gets one prompt where Images created = NO.
* Select Prompt: Extracts the prompt text and row number.

# 3. File Infrastructure

* Check/Create Google Sheet: Verifies if the day's sheet exists; if not, duplicates a blueprint.
* Check/Create Drive Folder: Verifies/creates the folder to store generated images.

# 4. Image Generation

* Edit Fields: Sets prompt and negative prompt text.
* Generate Image: Sends request to PIAPI to generate 4 images.
* Wait 20 Seconds: Delays to allow PIAPI to process.
* Get Images: Polls PIAPI for image URLs.

# 5. Image Handling

* Check Response: If no images returned, loops back to wait.
* Split Out: Separates image URLs.
* Download Images: Downloads each image.

# 6. Image Processing

* Comp Images: Shrinks images for metadata generation.
* Resize Image X2: Upscales for high-res upload.

# 7. Metadata Generation

* Analyze Images: Sends image to GPT-4o-mini to generate:
   * filename, title, category, 25 keywords
* Split Out Data: Separates results per image.
* Parse OpenAI Response: Converts JSON to n8n-readable format.

# 8. Format & Merge

* Numbering: Adds sequence to each image.
* Merge: Combines binary and metadata.
* Sanitize Filenames: Converts titles to clean, lowercase, underscore-based file names.

# 9. Upload & Log

* Upload Images: Saves to Google Drive folder.
* Google Sheets3: Writes metadata to the new sheet.
* Google Sheets4: Marks original prompt as Images created = YES.
* Telegram: Sends message confirming upload.



# Workflow C: Error Logger

This optional workflow is triggered when an error occurs in the image generation or metadata processing workflow.

# 1. Trigger

* Can be connected to the Error Trigger node from any primary workflow.

# 2. Capture Error Context

* Captures key error details:
   * Workflow name
   * Node name
   * Error message
   * Timestamp
   * Any relevant input data

# 3. Log to Google Sheets

* Appends a new row to a dedicated ""Error Log"" sheet with the captured details.

# 4. Telegram Notification

* Sends error alerts to Telegram.

# Highlights

* üîÅ Automated cycle: From topic ‚Üí prompts ‚Üí images ‚Üí metadata ‚Üí final assets
* üé® Detailed prompts: Ensures photorealism and creative diversity
* ü§ñ AI metadata: Optimized for Adobe Stock standards
* üìÅ Smart file handling: Unique folders and sheets per day
* üì¨ Real-time updates: Telegram notifications for visibility
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Robust error logging: Track failures with full context and notifies you to telegram

# Ideal Use Cases

* Stock photo creators
* Agencies generating niche content daily
* AI art businesses scaling uploads
* Print-on-demand sellers looking to automate content creation

# Final Thoughts

This three-part n8n system turns daily ideas into publishable, metadata-rich images with full automation and error transparency. It‚Äôs modular, scalable, and ideal for creatives and content businesses looking to streamline their workflow.

A recent situation that caught my attention was when I was in a cafe. I ordered a latte and a snack, put the snack at a bar seat at the window, and went over to wait for my latte. A girl was sitting at a different bar table, moved her stuff over to where I set my snack down, and then when I went back to sit down with my coffee she literally got up and went back to her original place. No one sat at the open two seats beside me for the duration of my time there, even when the place got full and those were the only two seats. This happens frequently in cafes, no one will sit next to me.

Every time I am on the bus, people will take every other seat except the one next to me. Even when it is full! People will stand right next to the open seat beside me and not take it. Especially if it is a girl, they will refuse to sit down.

18m, previously a GAS student. Likes to draw (but I'm not really that good, also coloring makes me regurgitate what I ate last night), likes to read books (mostly sci fi and fantasy, but sometimes if I feel really bored I read history). 

My YouTube history is filled with video game tournament matches/tutorials, literary overviews, crime/major disaster documentaries, and Markiplier. 

Speaking of video games, I mostly play turn based games like pokemon (mostly fangames though, in my opinion the newer games are wayyyy too expensive for their own right), limbus company and epic7, tower defense games like arknights, and some rhythm games like fnf, osu, lanota, arcaea (though I am EXTREMELY washed now for physical reasons). 

The more niche stuff: 

Doesn't talk much irl (unless we're close)
I HATE coffee
Often skeptical, but not judgemental
Cat person 
Doesn't really ask for much, sometimes doesn't even ask for anything
Mild astigmatism 
Has a daily routine, but doesn't go to the gym (I went like once or twice and never again because I got embarrassed of asking how to use the machines)
Favorite color is blue
Will eat anything with blueberries in it
Favorite cake flavor is red velvet (specifically that one from the greenbelt library, above the greenbelt chapel... but it's gone now so I may never taste heaven ever again) (red ribbon's version is a federal offense and someone should sue for how dogshit and expensive it is)

I've always thought I had a curious mind, but lately, it's more than that. It's like there's this pull towards something profound... maybe it's a genuine connection? Or maybe just understanding myself better? Idk, it's a wild ride with these thoughts sometimes.

The people around me are amazing, don't get me wrong, but I feel like I'm missing this spark of adventure or depth in my day-to-day. It's not about chasing thrills; it's more about finding moments that make me feel alive.

1ksj70t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1ksj70t/are_antique_chairs_comfortable/,Are antique chairs comfortable?,"Megan had always loved browsing through antique shops on weekends. She wasn‚Äôt a collector, but there was something comforting about the worn wood, the craftsmanship, and the quiet stories that old furniture seemed to whisper. One Saturday, while helping her friend furnish a new apartment, she stumbled on a small, cozy-looking shop tucked between a caf√© and a florist.

Inside, the air smelled of aged paper and varnish. Among the many curiosities, her eyes were drawn to a pair of antique armchairs with carved wooden frames and faded floral upholstery. They looked elegant‚Äîstraight out of a Jane Austen movie‚Äîbut also like they might crumble under pressure. Her friend joked, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre beautiful, but I doubt they‚Äôre actually comfortable.‚Äù

That comment sparked Megan‚Äôs curiosity. She asked the shop owner, an older man named Richard, if she could sit in one. He nodded with a grin and said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve lasted over a hundred years; I think they can handle one more test.‚Äù

Megan eased herself into the chair. It felt surprisingly firm. Not plush or pillowy like modern recliners, but it had a supportive kind of comfort‚Äîlike it was built with a better understanding of posture. The back was high, encouraging her to sit up straight, and the seat was deep enough to cross her legs comfortably. She sat in it for nearly ten minutes while chatting with Richard about its origin (Victorian, apparently), and to her surprise, she didn‚Äôt want to get up.

Intrigued, she decided to dig deeper. Over the next few weeks, she visited a few more antique stores and tested various chairs‚Äîsome from the 1800s, others mid-century. She even joined a furniture restoration forum where people often shared their own experiences with older pieces. A clear pattern emerged: comfort varied, but when antique chairs were well-maintained and not just decorative, many were surprisingly ergonomic. It turned out, a lot of them were designed for long periods of sitting‚Äîwriting letters, hosting guests, or reading.

Megan did discover some downsides. A few chairs were indeed stiff or creaky. One Victorian dining chair nearly pinched her when she sat on it. Another had been reupholstered in scratchy fabric that didn‚Äôt feel great on bare legs. And there were definitely no reclining features or memory foam seats.

But the well-built ones‚Äîespecially those with original craftsmanship still intact‚Äîoffered a very different kind of comfort. Less about sinking in, more about feeling supported.

In the end, Megan bought that first floral-upholstered chair. She had it gently re-cushioned by a local artisan, keeping its vintage charm. It sat in the corner of her living room, next to a window, where she drank her morning coffee and read in the afternoons. When friends came over and hesitated before sitting, she‚Äôd just smile and say, ‚ÄúTry it. You‚Äôd be surprised.‚Äù

So, are antique chairs comfortable? Megan would say: not always, but the good ones definitely are‚Äîjust in their own unique, timeless way.",1,1747892325.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

I think its gonna be a very long vent. It's been a lot. I'll try my best to keep everything in order and coherent. Excuse my english and apostrophies etc in advance, it is kind of my 3rd language. (also my first post please dont judge and give me some advice on how to write etc, ill appreciate that and try to improve in the future)

Lets start off when I was a line cook, went to cooking school at 18 after high school. Did that til about 23-24, eventually got to a point where i had to decide whether i had to become a ""chef"" or stay a line cook. Personally, i always loved being a ""tool"", like a line cook. just say ""yes chef"" and go with the flow. had my own share of getting yelled at, sauces thrown at me, abused mentally and physically (tough industry).

When i was met with the decision of whether i gotta stop being a tool and become an actual mentor/chef/teacher (for career reasons and salary, but also, abuse isnt that fun), my leg was hurting quite a bit (some veins looking like they were gonna burst, still a persistant thing to this day) i decided i wanted to do something else and went in school for 3d game dev (just a general 1 year college program for becoming a.... game generalist in a sense)

While i was at that, i had one class, with a teacher who taught me about ""cinema"" rather than ""game"" which was a genuine class (ray tracing aka movies in a sense vs games which is real time) and i fell in love with it. After school, i got a job through my teacher in that domain and worked there for 3 and a half years. Games were a bit ""simple"" to me and exploring the detailing you could do in movies (no constraint as to lets say, the performance and time it takes to create something) really captivated me and i went on to do some really fun stuff and im still very happy about the results.

Then came the hollywood strike of the scenarists. my company went from 50-60 employees to about 20 in 4 months, and in another 2 months i would be fired, being the oldest/senior at that studio (having trained people who havent been fired). It really hurt but i had to move on i guess. (i still havent due to overtime i put into that job, the stress of it and also being a mentor to about 5-10 people in a tight little team) currently i believe the company has about 10 employees left, give or take 2 (been 1 year since i got fired)

I went on employment insurance (canada pays u if u lose ur job kinda thing) for about 6 months and in the middle of it started working at a lil restaurant, under the table, to make some cash on top of what the gov was giving me.

the cash helped me sustain myself here and there (smoker and drinker here. trying to slow down both) while the gov checks almost always went to pay my debt (there was some school debt and also maxing my credit cards after some vacation trips with my ex/moving in on my own after breaking up with said ex and having to buy furniture on top of paying crazy rent prices after covid...)

im still in debt but i applied to uni to go and study programming, taking a class or two, here and there in the AI stuff (seems to be where the world is going and what is causing people to lose jobs in these exact industries) i could go on forever about the destruction the AI stuff is causing to so many people.

so right now, up until i work in uni, im working in this below minimum wage shitty place where most of the people havent finished 8th grade. 2 of the people i work with cant read analog clocks, cant do simple math like 35.76 + 3.00 without a calculator and i havent had a single meaningful conversation since ive been here (been like 3 months)

the whole reason for this rant is my gf got me a blank black hoodie, sawed a little futurama spaceship into it and it was my very favourite, i have been very careful with it, but some dumbass spilled chlorine all over a working station i leaned against and now its all burnt (black hoodie). i think its the fact that that person cant read clocks, calls people who smoke weed and/or do any harder drug than coffee ""crack head"" is the one to ruin this special hoodie of mine, pisses me off so fucking much.

being in this place right now sucks for me really bad. mentally most of all but ive also picked up a bit of drinking and have been drinking quite some more, i guess to drown it out? which im trying to fix. i finally have an interview soon for a QA position which aligns with my future studies so thats great. but i have been applaying in my domain and since the strike i couldnt get anything, maybe its me, but to be honest, at least i can tell what fucking time it is when looking at a 4 foot giant clock in the restaurant.",1,1747892170.0,self,0,1.0,False

While loading up my car after checking out, a friendly looking woman about my age approached me. She complimented my hair and was asking a lot of questions about it. I get a lot of comments about my hair because it‚Äôs fairly unique and I dye it myself, so this wasn‚Äôt necessarily odd. Most people walk away afterwards and that is that. This woman, Krystal, continued to have conversation with me. I made sure I informed her I was autistic pretty quickly. I know I can come across strange or odd and make people uncomfortable if they don‚Äôt know I am autistic.   

We continue talking for a good amount of time, the sun was almost completely down. We talked about bugs, pepper spray, alt-fashion, hair, and she asked me ‚Äòwhat I do‚Äô. I told her I am disabled and only able to work part time from home because of the severity of my health conditions. She mentioned she had a ‚Äòsmall business‚Äô that was doing really well and looking to expand soon, she said she just did marketing for a few businesses. I have a lot of experience in small business marketing and we talked about it a bit, but work-related talk was a very small part of our overall conversation.   

She eventually said she‚Äôd let me go, and I told her genuinely that I really appreciated her stopping and talking with me. We exchanged numbers and I told her that it was really difficult to make friends as adults and it meant so much that she reached out to me. I told her I‚Äôd watch a movie she recommended as one of her ‚Äòfavorites‚Äô and she said we could have coffee soon. It really made me happy, I was so starved for human connection.   

She reached out the next day to schedule a ‚Äòcoffee date‚Äô with me a couple days away, which I agreed to. I made sure to watch the movie she recommended and showed up, excited to have a friend and chat about the weird topics we both seemed to like. She hugged me when she saw me and we sat down. She took out her phone and it had a timer for 30min on it. She started going into a whole presentation about her ‚Äòsmall business‚Äô and bombarding me with questions and asking me to commit to things. I played along because I honestly didn‚Äôt know what else to do, but I tried to figure out if she was in some sort of cult. She would never say the name of the ‚Äòsmall business‚Äô she worked for but I later found out it was Amway.   

Now, this is where I might have gone overboard and been TA. I got extremely triggered leaving that ‚Äòmeeting‚Äô with her, I have had the worst year of my life and been really taken advantage of by the people that should have loved me the most. These are our text messages after her presentation, so you can judge and tell me if I am TA.   


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   


**Krystal:** Hey! I don't remember if I mentioned this yesterday, but you'll need to read all of the articles before the webinar tomorrow.   


**Krystal:** Hey! Here is the webinar for you and Bryan! I'll call you around 5:30 pm.   


**Krystal:** Were you able to read all of the articles that I sent you?   


**Me:**   
I have been reflecting on our first encounter and our coffee shop meeting and would like to share my thoughts with you.   

When you first approached me, I was so excited that a stranger showed interest and kindness towards me. I informed you almost immediately that I am autistic and disabled. When you continued to seemingly want to connect, it was a nice surprise. I have no friends, my family is far away, and I am isolated because of my disabilities and autism. You love to use the phrase ""everything happens for a reason"" and I used to believe that fully, too. I have lost a lot of faith in that sentiment over the last year of my life, but still was holding on to a small amount of hope and openness that something good might find me.   

I have been in a very dark and lonely place recently, my mental and physical health have been in shambles. When you had that conversation with me, I really thought that the universe was sending me a life raft, an outstretched hand.   

Do you realize that was the first time I had left my house in over a week? That you were the only person I had spoken with in that same amount of time?   
Even if that was the only conversation we had, it would have been enough to keep my hope and openness going for a while longer. I even watched ""Turbo"" because you said it was one of your favorite movies, even though snails are really difficult for me to watch. I was excited to talk about it with you when you invited me to meet you for coffee a few days later.   

Going out to meet new people, in new places, is something I almost never do. It has only happened a few times in my life. I really took a risk and a gamble with you because I wanted a friend. I thought that you might talk about your 'small business' a bit and we could talk more about bugs and alt-fashion. Instead, you ordered nothing, set a timer for 30min, and went into the most basic and boring pitch I have ever heard.   

I was raised in a cult, I studied cult behaviors and the B.I.T.E. Model when receiving my Psychology and Communications degrees. I watched you carefully and played along, wondering how cruel you could possibly be.   

You dropped the facade of friendship extremely quickly and became cold, calculated, and a predator. You saw me and you only saw potential future money. Deluding yourself in your mind that you weren't actually victimizing the disabled, autistic woman in front of you.   

You know the statistics, and if you don't, you are a gullible fool. I guess that would make two of us.   

I know all the justifications you have been filled with, scripts you have memorized, buzzwords you have handy to throw around.   

""You don't pay a thing for a whole year!""   

""We are taking the risk by investing in you, not the other way around.""   

It is seen in every MLM, cult, and predatory organization in the world. It is so very predictable and boring. I made sure to put in some genuine probes during our 'meeting' to gauge just how heartless and predatory you really are. I told you that I only aligned myself with things that were ethical, moral, and transparent. You agreed with me eagerly that you believe the same.   

Was our first encounter any of those things?   

Was our second?   

Are you truly ok, in your core, with seeing a disabled, autistic woman in need of human connection and using that for your financial gain no matter the consequences?   

I saw how you chose each of your words carefully. How you used the little amounts of information I gave you for the facade of seeming interested in who I was to manipulate me. How you were never transparent or clear about a single aspect of your 'small business'.   

You should have kept your soul intact and stayed in the family tamale business, if that was even a true story at all.   

That is a life that has worth and meaning, work that you could actually be proud of. What you're doing is disgusting and you're giving away bits and pieces of your humanity and soul each time you approach a stranger in public and use the need of human connection as a way for you to be greedy and gaudy with a material life.   

After our meeting, I cried the entire night. You broke the last piece of hope in me. Now, I can't even trust that a person who approaches me with a smile and a compliment is anything but a shark. That I have to harden myself to everyone now because I have learned I am not someone worthy of a friend. You have damaged me permanently and my outlook on humanity. I already felt like an outcast as an autistic person and now I know that I am only seen as a gullible potential fool to people like you.   

I hope it was worth it for whatever next clothing or jewelry item you purchase.   

Also, Turbo was really bad.

That early energy is powerful. But staying stuck there? That‚Äôs how good ideas stall out before they become real.

If you‚Äôve got something worth pursuing, it deserves more than a sketch and a wish. It needs structure, protection, and a few real steps forward. That doesn‚Äôt mean building a 40-page business plan. It means making intentional moves‚Äîstarting with forming an LLC.

This isn‚Äôt about looking impressive. It‚Äôs about treating your idea like it matters. Because it does.

[starting a small business](https://preview.redd.it/godqvvu0r92f1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bbceed593368adefd403af69c5fe82ff29b394c)

# The Problem with Staying Casual

Everyone starts somewhere. But staying too casual for too long creates problems.

Let‚Äôs say you start selling handmade candles. Orders trickle in. You‚Äôre storing wax in your kitchen and shipping from your garage. You think, *This is working‚Äîno need to change anything yet.*

Then someone says your packaging caused an allergic reaction. Or a customer cancels a large order, and you‚Äôre stuck with $500 in unsold inventory. Or you try to open a business bank account and the bank says, *Come back when you‚Äôre official.*

Starting small isn‚Äôt the problem. Staying unstructured is.

If you don‚Äôt treat your business seriously, others won‚Äôt either.

# LLC: The First Step Toward Taking Your Business Seriously

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) gives your business its own [legal identity](https://www.usa.gov/start-business). That‚Äôs not just legal lingo‚Äîit has real impact.

When you operate as a sole proprietor (no LLC, no legal structure), *you* are the business. That means your personal stuff‚Äîyour savings, your car, even your house‚Äîis on the line if something goes wrong.

Forming an LLC puts a layer of protection between you and your business. Think of it as drawing a solid line between your personal life and your business risks.

Here‚Äôs what you get with an LLC:

* **Liability protection**: Your personal assets are shielded from most business-related lawsuits and debts.
* **Credibility**: You look more established and trustworthy to clients, vendors, and banks.
* **Simplicity**: You get legal protection without the red tape of forming a corporation.
* **Tax flexibility**: You can stick with default pass-through taxation or elect S Corp status later to save on self-employment taxes (when appropriate).

It‚Äôs a small move that sets the tone for everything else you build.

# ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Wait Until It‚Äôs Bigger‚Äù is a Risky Strategy

You don‚Äôt need a big customer list or full-time hours to justify an LLC. In fact, the earlier you form one, the better.

Waiting means:

* You‚Äôre operating without a safety net.
* You can‚Äôt open a business bank account tied to your company name.
* You might be signing contracts or collecting payments without legal protection.

Think of it like locking your front door. You don‚Äôt wait until someone breaks in to buy a lock.

# How to Form an LLC Without Getting Overwhelmed

Forming an LLC sounds intimidating to some, but it‚Äôs a straightforward process in most states. You don‚Äôt need a lawyer. You don‚Äôt need to read law books. You just need to follow a few steps.

**1. Choose a name.**  
Make sure it‚Äôs unique in your state. Most Secretary of State websites have a name search tool.

**2. Pick a registered agent.**  
This is the person (or service) that will receive legal documents for your business. You can be your own agent, or hire one for a small annual fee.

**3. File Articles of Organization.**  
This is the official paperwork that creates your LLC. You can usually do this online. State filing fees range from $50 to $200.

**4. Create an Operating Agreement.**  
Even if you‚Äôre a [solo business owner](https://smallbizsprint.com/business-niches/business.aspx?business=digital-nomad-consultant), this document outlines how your business is run. It can help prevent misunderstandings down the line.

**5. Get an EIN from the IRS.**  
This is like a Social Security number for your business. You‚Äôll need it to open a business bank account or hire employees. It‚Äôs free and takes 10 minutes online.

That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre official. And just like that, your back-of-the-napkin idea starts to look like something real.

# What Else Makes You Look Ready for Business

An LLC is foundational. But here are a few more simple ways to treat your idea like a business‚Äînot a side project.

**1. Get a domain name and professional email.**  
[YourBusiness@gmail.com]() might work at first, but it doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence. Buy a domain, set up an email like [info@YourBusiness.com](), and watch how differently people respond to you.

**2. Set up a business bank account.**  
Once you have your LLC and EIN, you can open a dedicated account. This keeps your finances clean and protects your liability status. Don‚Äôt mix personal and business money.

**3. Create a basic online presence.**  
You don‚Äôt need a full-blown website from day one, but a simple homepage, an About section, and a contact form go a long way. Use a clean template, list your services clearly, and make it easy to reach you.

**4. Start using contracts and invoices.**  
Even for small jobs. Use tools like Wave, HoneyBook, or Bonsai to send polished invoices and keep records. Contracts don‚Äôt have to be fancy‚Äîjust clear about the scope, payment terms, and timelines.

**5. Set office hours or communication boundaries.**  
Even if you work odd hours, [setting expectations](https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/strategy/free-resources-for-small-businesses) helps people treat you like a business, not a buddy doing favors.

# From Scrappy Idea to Structured Business

Imagine two people start the same business idea at the same time. One keeps it casual‚ÄîVenmo payments, no website, personal email. The other forms an LLC, sets up systems, and presents themselves professionally.

Who‚Äôs more likely to get hired? Trusted? Recommended?

[Structure breeds confidence](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/small-business-programs/small-and-disadvantaged-business-utilization/small-business-resources). Not just in your clients, but in yourself. The minute you treat your business like it matters, other people start doing the same.

You don‚Äôt need to fake being a ‚Äúbig‚Äù business. But you do need to show up like one that‚Äôs built to last.

# A Real Example: The Jump from Casual to Committed

Emily started tutoring kids after school. She kept things simple‚Äîtexting parents, accepting payments in cash or PayPal. But when a parent asked for an invoice for tax records, she panicked. She didn‚Äôt have one. When another parent asked if she was insured, she had to say no.

She realized her business was growing faster than she was.

Emily took a weekend, formed an LLC, opened a business account, and bought basic liability insurance. She created a website with a contact form and calendar link. She didn‚Äôt raise prices or change her methods‚Äîbut parents began treating her differently.

More referrals. Less flakiness. Higher trust. Same service, but with structure.

# Don‚Äôt Wait for ‚ÄúPermission‚Äù to Take the Next Step

There‚Äôs no business fairy who tells you it‚Äôs time to take things seriously. You decide that.

The steps aren‚Äôt complicated. But they do require intention. Filing for an LLC, setting up accounts, and presenting yourself professionally sends a clear message‚Äîto your clients, your partners, and yourself.

Are you also tired of crowded gyms, waiting times on equipment, or the constant back and forth between work and the gym? I feel you! As someone constantly shuttling between office, home, and occasional travels, finding a flexible workout solution was my holy grail. And then - BOOM! - I discovered the HOTWAVE Portable Workout Equipment. This compact wonder bag with 20 gym accessories has literally revolutionized my fitness routine!

Today, I'm taking you on a tour through this amazing set that allows me to work out pretty much anywhere. No joke, I've used it in hotel rooms, parks, and even during a conference call break (camera off, obviously!).

# What Exactly is HOTWAVE Portable Workout Equipment?

So what's this magical fitness solution I'm raving about? The HOTWAVE is essentially a comprehensive home gym that fits in a bag. Yep, you heard that right ‚Äì a COMPLETE gym setup that you can carry around! It's for anyone who's ever thought, ""I wish I could just work out right now, right here"" ‚Äì which, let's be honest, is all of us at some point.

The system centers around resistance bands of varying strengths, but calling it ""just resistance bands"" would be like calling a Ferrari ""just a car."" This kit comes with 20 different accessories that transform these bands into a versatile workout station that can target literally every muscle group in your body.

**Key components include:**

* Multiple resistance bands with different strength levels (like having a full rack of dumbbells in your pocket!)
* Various handles and attachments that'll make you forget you're not using traditional gym equipment
* Door anchors that transform any boring old doorway into your personal cable machine
* Ankle straps that'll make your legs scream (in a good way, promise!)
* A carrying bag so sleek you might want to show it off at the office

# Why Portable Equipment is a Game-Changer

Remember when we all thought home fitness was just about dusty dumbbells in the corner or that exercise bike that eventually becomes a clothes hanger? :) Those days are gone, my friend! Portable equipment has flipped the fitness world on its head, and here's why that matters.

First off, **consistency is king** in fitness. The biggest hurdle most of us face isn't knowing what to do ‚Äì it's actually doing it regularly. When your gym is wherever you are, that excuse of ""I can't make it to the gym today"" completely vanishes. Poof! Gone like my motivation on donut day.

Second, have you ever calculated how much time you spend traveling to and from the gym? For me, it was around 40 minutes round trip, plus changing time, plus the obligatory ""hey, how's it going"" conversations with the regulars. That's almost an hour that could be spent on actual exercise or, you know, literally anything else more enjoyable!

And can we talk money for a sec? The average gym membership runs between $40-$50 monthly. Over a year, that's $500+ compared to a one-time investment in something like the HOTWAVE system. The math isn't complicated, folks ‚Äì unless you're like me and still count on your fingers sometimes.

You can grab your own portable gym system right here.

# Resistance Training: The Science Behind the Bands

Now, I know what some of you might be thinking: ""Can I really get a good workout with just bands?"" Spoiler alert: ABSOLUTELY.

Resistance bands work on a principle called variable resistance. Unlike weights that rely solely on gravity, bands increase resistance as they stretch. This means your muscles are engaged throughout the ENTIRE movement ‚Äì no resting at the top or bottom of reps. Science has actually shown this continuous tension is fantastic for muscle development. Translation? Your muscles have to work harder, and they don't get to slack off like that one coworker who mysteriously disappears every time there's heavy lifting to do.

**Fun fact:** NASA uses resistance bands as part of their astronaut training program. If it's good enough for space, it's probably good enough for your living room! I mean, unless your fitness goals are literally out of this world...

Research published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that elastic resistance training produces similar strength gains to traditional weight training. The key difference? You're not risking dropping a heavy barbell on your foot when you're home alone. Been there, nearly done that ‚Äì not fun! My toes still have PTSD from my early weightlifting days.

Want to experience space-worthy resistance training?

# Deep Dive: The 20 Accessories Explained

Let's break down what you actually get with this bad boy. The HOTWAVE system includes 20 different accessories, each with a specific purpose. It's like having 20 different gym machines in one convenient package. Marie Kondo would be so proud of this space efficiency!

# The Resistance Bands Collection

The heart of the system is its various resistance bands:

* **Light bands (10-20lbs)** ‚Äì Perfect for beginners or rehabilitation exercises. These are your ""I'm just getting started but watch out world"" bands.
* **Medium bands (20-40lbs)** ‚Äì Great for toning and moderate resistance work. The ""I know what I'm doing but I'm not showing off"" range.
* **Heavy bands (40-60lbs)** ‚Äì For serious strength building. These scream ""I eat protein bars for breakfast.""
* **Extra heavy bands (60-80lbs)** ‚Äì For the beasts among us. If you're using these for warm-ups, we probably can't be friends because you intimidate me.

What I love is that you can combine these for progressive overload ‚Äì a fancy way of saying ""making exercises harder as you get stronger."" Ever tried doing a chest press with 100+ lbs of band resistance? Your pecs will definitely know about it tomorrow, and possibly the day after, and maybe even the day after that!

# Attachment Arsenal

The genius of the HOTWAVE system is in its attachments:

* **Cushioned handles** ‚Äì These make exercises comfortable even when you're pulling heavy resistance. Your callus-free hands will thank you!
* **Door anchor** ‚Äì Transforms any doorway into a pulley station. This little piece of magic makes me feel like MacGyver every time I set up.
* **Ankle straps** ‚Äì For all those leg exercises that make you hate leg day slightly less. They're like tiny hugs for your ankles... that cause massive muscle burn.
* **Bar attachments** ‚Äì Simulate barbell movements without the actual barbell. All the benefits of looking cool lifting a bar without that awkward ""where do I store this thing?"" problem afterward.

IMO, the door anchor is the MVP here. It lets you do exercises like lat pulldowns and tricep pushdowns that usually require massive gym equipment. The first time I used it, I kept looking around waiting for someone to come tell me this was too simple to actually work. But work it did!

If you want to transform any doorway into your personal gym, get your HOTWAVE system here.

# Bonus Features That Surprised Me

When I first got my HOTWAVE system, there were a few things I wasn't expecting:

* A detailed exercise guide showing exactly how to perform dozens of exercises (because let's face it, we all need pictures)
* A mobile app that pairs with the equipment (technology, am I right? What's next, smart water bottles? Oh wait, those exist...)
* The quality of the carrying case ‚Äì it's actually sturdy, not the cheap afterthought I expected that falls apart faster than my New Year's resolutions

# Real Talk: My Experience Using HOTWAVE

Alright, time for some real talk. I've been using this system for about 8 months now, and there are definitely things I love and a few things I'd change.

**The awesome stuff:**

Working out has never been more convenient. I've done full-body workouts in hotel rooms half the size of my bathroom. When traveling for work took me away from my regular gym for two weeks, I didn't miss a single workout thanks to this kit. My colleagues thought I was crazy for packing workout equipment until they saw me bouncing into morning meetings with energy while they were still mainlining coffee.

The progressive resistance system actually works. I started with the lighter bands and have graduated to combining the heavy ones for certain exercises. My strength has legitimately improved ‚Äì not just maintained. My partner noticed the difference before I did, which was both flattering and slightly annoying because I love being the first to spot progress.

Setup and takedown take literally minutes. From packed bag to full workout setup in under 3 minutes? That's faster than finding parking at my old gym! Or faster than I can decide what to watch on Netflix before a workout (the eternal struggle is real).

**The not-so-awesome stuff:**

The bands do deteriorate over time with heavy use. After about six months of 3-4 workouts weekly, I noticed my heaviest band starting to show signs of wear. Nothing catastrophic, but something to keep an eye on. Kind of like how your favorite jeans eventually start to wear at the knees.

Some exercises just feel weird with bands compared to free weights. Squats, in particular, took some getting used to. The resistance pattern is just different. It's like switching from coffee to tea ‚Äì you know they're both caffeinated beverages, but the experience isn't the same.

If you're someone who needs the motivation of a gym environment, this might not completely replace that experience for you. No one's going to be around to spot you or silently judge your form (though maybe that's actually a plus?).

# Creative Ways to Use Your HOTWAVE System

One thing that keeps me engaged with my HOTWAVE system is finding new ways to use it. Let me share some of my favorite ""hacks"" that'll make you feel like a fitness MacGyver:

# Outdoor Workouts 2.0

Forget simple park workouts. I've anchored my bands around tree trunks for a nature-based gym experience. There's something oddly satisfying about doing cable flyes with a giant oak as your anchor point! Pro tip: make sure it's an actual tree and not just a really tall person standing very still. Awkward conversations may ensue.

# Partner Workouts

My girlfriend and I often do resistance workouts together using the system. One person can be the ""anchor"" while the other works out. It's become a weird bonding activity for us ‚Äì nothing says romance like counting each other's reps, right? :/ Still waiting for this to be featured in a romantic comedy, but until then, we'll keep sweating together and pretending it's cute.

# Hybrid Workouts

I've combined the HOTWAVE with other minimal equipment for some killer sessions. For example, using the bands with a basic pullup bar exponentially increases the exercise variations available to you. It's like when you discover you can put peanut butter AND jelly on a sandwich ‚Äì mind blown with the possibilities!

# Who Should (and Shouldn't) Get This System?

Let's be real ‚Äì no fitness equipment is perfect for everyone. So who would benefit most from the HOTWAVE system?

**Perfect for:**

* Busy professionals who can't always make it to the gym (you know, the ""my calendar looks like a game of Tetris"" crowd)
* Frequent travelers who don't want to miss workouts (because hotel gyms with their one treadmill and half a dumbbell don't cut it)
* People living in small spaces without room for traditional equipment (apartment dwellers, I see you and your closet-sized living rooms)
* Fitness enthusiasts looking to supplement their regular routine (variety is the spice of life, right?)
* Beginners intimidated by traditional gym environments (no more feeling like everyone's watching you figure out how to use the leg press!)

**Maybe not ideal for:**

* Competitive powerlifters needing very heavy resistance (sorry, folks who deadlift small cars for fun)
* People who rely on gym social atmosphere for motivation (if you go to the gym primarily to socialize, I respect that, but we're different species)
* Those who strongly prefer the feel of traditional weights (some people just need cold iron in their hands, and that's valid)

# How to Maximize Your HOTWAVE Workout Results

If you decide to grab this system (which, honestly, I think you should), here are my top tips for getting the most from it:

1. **Follow a proper program** ‚Äì Don't just randomly do exercises like a toddler with fitness equipment. Follow a structured program like you would at a gym. Your results will thank you.
2. **Embrace slow and controlled movements** ‚Äì With bands, it's all about time under tension. Slow down your reps for maximum benefit. Think sloth, not cheetah (probably the only time being compared to a sloth is a compliment).
3. **Combine bands for progression** ‚Äì As you get stronger, don't just do more reps ‚Äì increase resistance by combining bands. It's like leveling up in a video game, but with more sweat.
4. **Use anchors creatively** ‚Äì Experiment with different anchor points to hit muscles from various angles. Your body adapts quickly, so keep it guessing! It's like playing hide and seek with your muscles.
5. **Maintain your equipment** ‚Äì Check your bands regularly for wear and tear to avoid any mid-workout surprises. Nobody wants a band snapping mid-rep. Trust me, it's not the kind of excitement you're looking for.

Ever wondered why so many fitness professionals are now incorporating band work into their routines? It's because the science backs it up ‚Äì variable resistance training works! And fitness pros are usually pretty picky about what they'll endorse, unlike me who will enthusiastically recommend any restaurant that gives free bread.

# Comparing HOTWAVE to Other Portable Fitness Solutions

I've tried several portable workout solutions over the years ‚Äì from simple resistance bands to collapsible kettlebells that were about as stable as my first apartment's WiFi. How does HOTWAVE stack up?

Compared to basic resistance band sets, HOTWAVE offers significantly more accessories and attachment options. Those door anchors and multiple connection possibilities make a world of difference. It's like comparing a Swiss Army knife to a regular knife ‚Äì both cut things, but one has WAY more options.

Against travel-friendly adjustable dumbbells, HOTWAVE wins on portability and versatility but loses some of the traditional weight training feel that some people prefer. Dumbbells are like that reliable friend who's always the same; bands are like that creative friend who keeps things interesting.

The TRX suspension system is probably its closest competitor, but HOTWAVE offers more versatility in resistance levels and types of exercises possible. TRX is awesome, don't get me wrong, but it's kind of a one-trick pony compared to the HOTWAVE circus.

For the price point and complete package, HOTWAVE delivers exceptional value compared to most systems I've tried. And I've tried enough fitness equipment to open a small, very eclectic gym.

# The Bottom Line: Is It Worth Your Money?

After eight months of consistent use, would I recommend the HOTWAVE Portable Workout Equipment with 20 Gym Accessories? Absolutely, 100%, bet-my-protein-shaker on it yes.

Is it perfect? No. Will it completely replace a fully-equipped gym for serious lifters? Probably not. But for maintaining and even building fitness while having maximum flexibility in where and when you work out, it's pretty hard to beat. It's like the difference between having a personal chef (gym) versus knowing how to cook amazing meals yourself (HOTWAVE) ‚Äì both get you fed, but one gives you independence.

The initial investment might seem higher than a single month of a gym membership, but think long-term ‚Äì this system pays for itself within a few months and continues delivering value long after. It's like buying versus renting, if renting also required you to drive somewhere, wait for equipment, and smell other people's interesting fragrance choices.

What really sells me on this product is the freedom it provides. Fitness should enhance your life, not complicate it with rigid schedules and locations. The HOTWAVE system understands this philosophy perfectly.

[Check out the HOTWAVE Portable Workout System here and experience fitness freedom for yourself.](https://www.amazon.com/HOTWAVE-Foldable-Strength-Stability-Equipment/dp/B0CJ558NT4?pd_rd_i=B0CJ558NT4&pd_rd_w=a7NcS&content-id=amzn1.sym.179b0a9f-c7da-43b2-999c-9ae4175e9a43&pf_rd_p=179b0a9f-c7da-43b2-999c-9ae4175e9a43&pf_rd_r=FY9ZMRTGN4EJJCFV2V27&pd_rd_wg=FQrS6&pd_rd_r=b7cf5bc8-581b-44ce-b7c4-9e94518f5c5d&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=fitness0582-20&linkId=0520f6eee9fe757dab52a27e4944833f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

# Final Thoughts: Fitness Freedom Awaits

At the end of the day, the best fitness equipment is the one you'll actually use consistently. For me, the convenience factor of the HOTWAVE system has translated directly into more consistent workouts and better results. It's like how the best camera is the one you have with you ‚Äì the best workout is the one you actually do.

If you're someone who values flexibility, efficiency, and results in your fitness journey, I genuinely believe this system deserves a spot in your arsenal. Your future self will thank you ‚Äì probably while admiring their improved physique in the mirror.

Remember when we used to think effective workouts required a room full of expensive, bulky equipment? Those days are officially over, like dial-up internet and flip phones. With innovations like the HOTWAVE system, effective fitness is available anywhere, anytime ‚Äì no excuses!

Ready to transform your approach to fitness? Give the HOTWAVE Portable Workout Equipment system a try. Your future self (with those improved muscles) will thank you!

Just finished Step 2 and wanted to share a few thoughts while it‚Äôs still fresh.

Overall, the exam felt fair. A few questions felt a bit off, but nothing completely unexpected. The content was in line with the NBMEs (13, 14, 15 and the new Free 120). I think if you‚Äôre comfortable with those, you‚Äôll feel prepared.

The question stems were mixed. But definitely more on the longer side. Got more than a handful of the HPI questions. It got mentally draining especially towards the end, it was harder to stay focused. Patience and stamina are just as important as knowing the content.

There was a good amount of QI, ethics, and palliative care. Divine Intervention helped a lot here. I reviewed the Divine PDF the day before the exam and also listened to a number of his episodes throughout my prep. His breakdown of the Free 120 was also really helpful‚Äîespecially his test-taking strategies. I scored 80% on that 2 days out.

These are the episodes I referred to:

37, 41, 97, 100, 111, 112, 123, 137, 143, 181, 182, 183, 197, 206, 212, 213, 214, 217, 228, 230, 234, 239, 268, 275, 276, 277, 325

I also went thru the Amboss HY 200. Unpopular opinion but definitely try squeezing emergency medicine and family medicine CMS forms. If not, definitely do the divine podcasts for them. (I have added the ep numbers above)

On test day, I tried to keep things simple. I brought a sandwich, a couple protein bars, some coffee, and a Celsius. Took short breaks between every block, had only 4 mins break time left in the end. But I definitely recommend to utilize the complete time. It‚Äôs a beast of an exam, you need to recharge.

It was a long day, hoping for the best outcome. 


I‚Äôll post a full breakdown soon with my score, NBME results, timeline, and everything I used for prep. In the meantime, if anyone has questions about anything, feel free to reach out.

Hope this helps someone.

He‚Äôs really handsome and I laughed really hard tonight. In a battle of wits, I‚Äôve met a match for sure. I do notice I have the final comeback and we both end up buckled over laughing.

I laugh to myself about something I thought of earlier today too- those zodiac signs. I‚Äôm Water, my children Fire, and Air. I figured we would in dream fairytale land find an Earth sign to complete us- but this Scorpio definitely has my attention.

But I wore the dress- I showed it to him- because it was never for me, but I did. That‚Äôs bad luck right?

We talked about it weeks after- and he thought the same thing- and said that he had a feeling that this wouldn‚Äôt be the dress or it would be an altered version.

Who knew coffee doesn‚Äôt normally taste like dirt and salad can make you feel full? 

I mean I didn‚Äôt- I‚Äôd never tried it those ways. 

Okay- my words are a mess today, but thanks for giving me epiphanies until 2 am and then panic attacks until 3 pm

What I‚Äôm trying to say is,

I‚Äôm tired
I want cuddles
And a snack
Some chocolate
And someone to stroke the outside of my ear and tell me it‚Äôs gonna be okay.

If you could remove that little issue we discussed earlier from my skull I would appreciate that too- but I‚Äôve asked for so many years now, and they‚Äôre still there, so does that mean they aren‚Äôt an issue?

Oh, and by the way,

I‚Äôll talk to you tomorrow to tell you about the bird- I emotionally can‚Äôt deal with myself right now, so getting into that is gonna get me to work late in a few hours. 

Next track.

Thanks for giving me the space to write this out.

Love, 

The girl who‚Äôs gonna pour some sugar on herself and hope for the best (but in the name of love, of course)

Author: Word Jelly M


The reek of stale synth-ale and desperation clung to the Zigzag Alley like a cheap space-cologne. Piper Lane, her crimson jacket a defiant splash of color in the gloom, felt the familiar prickle of eyes on her back. Tonight‚Äôs score had gone south faster than a greased grav-sled. The ""merchandise"" ‚Äì a crate of giggling, multi-limbed Grobnars ‚Äì had developed an unexpected fondness for chewing through their restraints. Now, Boris ""The Brute"" Brodsky and his two goons, built like chrome-plated garbage disposals, were hot on her heels.

""Lane! You ain't gettin' away with our Grobnars!"" Boris‚Äôs voice, a gravelly rumble, echoed off the corrugated metal walls.

Piper risked a glance over her shoulder. They were gaining. Her pulse hammered against her ribs. Her trusty, if slightly temperamental, laser pistol felt light in her grip. This wasn't about the Grobnars anymore; it was about the principle. Nobody ripped off Piper Lane.

With a burst of speed honed by years of outrunning both law and lowlifes, she ducked into a dimly lit doorway, the air thick with the aroma of questionable space-noodles. A startled vendor yelped as she vaulted over his steaming cart, sending tendrils of purple broth skyward.

""Sorry, pops! Gotta fly!"" she yelled, already weaving through the maze of makeshift stalls and shady characters. Her piloting instincts kicked in, treating the alleyway like an asteroid field. A quick slide under a hovering cargo drone, a sharp turn around a stack of wobbly power cells ‚Äì she was a phantom in the chaos.

But Boris was persistent, his heavy boots thudding relentlessly. Cornered at a dead end ‚Äì a shimmering energy field humming ominously ‚Äì Piper knew she had to improvise. Spotting a discarded anti-grav skateboard leaning against a wall, a wicked grin spread across her face. With a running leap, she snatched it, the magnetic wheels whirring to life just as Boris and his goons lumbered into view.

""Catch me if you can, metalheads!"" she taunted, soaring over the energy field with inches to spare, leaving Boris sputtering in her wake. The thrill of the escape, however brief, couldn't fully mask the gnawing anxiety. Her brother, Jax, was still rotting in the Cinder Moon penal colony, his only crime being born with her questionable genes. Credits were the only key, and her recent‚Ä¶ entrepreneurial endeavors‚Ä¶ hadn't exactly been filling the coffers.

Later, nursing a lukewarm synth-coffee in a dimly lit space-bar frequented by more rust than patrons, Piper overheard snippets of conversation that made her ears perk up. ""...the Nova Run... biggest purse in the galaxy..."" ""...insane obstacles... only the craziest pilots...""

The Nova Run. Every five years, a legendary, unsanctioned race that carved a brutal path through the galaxy‚Äôs most treacherous locales. Wormholes that shifted without warning, asteroid fields denser than a politician‚Äôs lies, active war zones where stray laser fire was considered a hazard of the track. The prize money? Enough to buy a small moon, let alone Jax‚Äôs freedom.

A dangerous idea, reckless even by her standards, began to bloom in Piper‚Äôs mind. She was banned from the Pilots‚Äô Guild, her name mud after that‚Ä¶ incident involving a shipment of sentient space-ferrets and a very confused customs official. But the galaxy had a short memory, especially when there were enough zeros in a prize fund. A fabricated identity, a fast ship, and a whole lot of daring ‚Äì it just might work.

Her first stop: Tanner Knox. Her ex. A former Galactic Enforcer with a permanent five o‚Äôclock shadow and a disposition as sunny as a neutron star. He‚Äôd traded in chasing criminals for the slightly less stressful life of a security consultant on the dusty, forgotten planet of Kepler-186f. Finding him wasn't hard; he was usually at the ""Rusty Sprocket,"" the only bar on the planet that served something resembling actual whiskey.

Tanner was exactly as she remembered: slumped over a chipped synth-wood table, nursing a drink that looked suspiciously like motor oil, his gaze fixed on a flickering holographic chess game he was clearly losing.

""Well, well, well,"" he grunted, not even bothering to look up. ""If it isn't Piper Lane. Last I heard, you were charming space slugs out on the Glargon Belt.""

""Very funny, Knox,"" Piper said, sliding into the opposite seat. The air crackled with the unresolved tension that always seemed to linger between them. ""I need your help.""

Tanner finally looked up, his steel-grey eyes narrowed with suspicion. ""Your help? Piper, the last time you needed my help, I ended up explaining to my superior officer why a shipment of 'exotic singing space-plants' had taken root in the evidence locker.""

""This is different,"" Piper insisted, leaning forward. ""This is about Jax.""

Tanner‚Äôs expression softened, a flicker of the man she once knew breaking through the cynicism. He knew about Jax. He‚Äôd even tried to help, within the rigid confines of the law, before Piper‚Äôs‚Ä¶ extracurricular activities‚Ä¶ had complicated things.

She laid out her plan ‚Äì the Nova Run, the forged identity, the astronomical prize money. Tanner listened, his initial skepticism slowly giving way to a grudging interest, mixed with a healthy dose of disbelief.

""Piper, that race is suicide with extra steps,"" he said, taking a long swig of his drink. ""And you're banned from flying anything faster than a planetary –ø–æ—á—Ç–∞–ª—å–æ–Ω.""

""Details, details,"" Piper waved a dismissive hand. ""I need someone who knows their way around a ship, someone who can keep my impulsive tendencies in check, and someone who‚Ä¶ well, who I trust, deep down, even if you are a grumpy old space-cop.""

A ghost of a smile touched Tanner‚Äôs lips. ""Grumpy former space-cop. And trust is a strong word coming from you, Lane."" But beneath the sarcasm, Piper saw a spark. The dull routine of his current life had clearly lost its luster. The lure of danger, the thrill of the impossible ‚Äì it was in his eyes.

""Think about it, Tanner,"" she pressed. ""Enough credits to get Jax out, a chance to stick it to the Pilots‚Äô Guild, and‚Ä¶ well, maybe a little bit of the old adrenaline rush?""

He sighed, running a hand over his stubbled chin. ""Adrenaline rush. That's putting it mildly. Alright, Lane. I'm in. But if we end up stranded in a black hole full of rabid space-squirrels, I'm blaming you.""

With Tanner reluctantly on board, their next destination was Neonexus, a sprawling, neon-drenched metropolis built on a colossal asteroid. It was a haven for tech-heads, smugglers, and anyone looking to soup up a starship beyond recognition. This was where they‚Äôd find Skye Monroe.

Skye was a legend in the underground engineering circles ‚Äì a prodigy with an uncanny ability to coax impossible performance out of even the most dilapidated machinery. Finding her workshop was an adventure in itself, located in the labyrinthine underbelly of Neonexus, amidst a cacophony of buzzing energy conduits and the metallic tang of welding fumes.

Skye, hunched over a complex array of glowing wires and humming processors, didn't even look up when they entered. Her wild, purple-streaked hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail, and her fingers danced across a holographic interface with astonishing speed.

""Can I help you‚Ä¶ or are you here to admire my collection of vintage circuit boards?"" she asked, her voice sharp and laced with a dry wit.

Piper cut to the chase, outlining their Nova Run plan and the need for a miracle-working engineer. Skye finally looked up, her intense green eyes scrutinizing them.

""The Nova Run? You're insane,"" she stated flatly, then a slow grin spread across her face. ""Tell me more.""

The challenge, the sheer audacity of the plan, clearly appealed to her. The promise of access to cutting-edge, often illegal, technology to modify their ship sealed the deal.

It was amidst the chaotic energy of Skye's workshop, while Piper was attempting to explain the finer points of ""not blowing us all to smithereens,"" that Blip made his entrance. He wasn't exactly grand. More like‚Ä¶ he just sort of was.

Attached to Piper‚Äôs shoulder, looking for all the galaxy like a metallic, slightly dented toaster with blinking antennae and tiny, surprisingly expressive eyes, was Blip.

""The only limits are the ones you place on yourself!"" Blip chirped, his voice a surprisingly deep baritone that didn't quite fit his diminutive size.

Piper flinched. ""Oh, for the love of‚Ä¶ guys, meet Blip.""

Tanner stared, his jaw slightly agape. ""That‚Ä¶ that's a toaster.""

""He prefers 'symbiotic life-form with advanced cognitive functions,'"" Blip corrected, his antennae twitching indignantly. ""And I am not a toaster! I am a‚Ä¶ a personal growth facilitator!""

Skye, however, was already circling Blip with a fascinated gleam in her eye. ""What in the nebula is that thing?""

""He‚Ä¶ sort of attached himself to me during a smuggling run on Xylos,"" Piper explained, trying to sound nonchalant about the talking parasite clinging to her jacket. ""Claims he's my coach. Mostly spouts motivational nonsense.""

""Nonsense?"" Blip sputtered. ""These are the timeless wisdoms that propel champions to victory! 'Every setback is a setup for a comeback!'""

Throughout the initial modifications to their ship ‚Äì a battered but surprisingly resilient freighter Piper had acquired through less-than-legal means and christened the ""Stardust Drifter"" ‚Äì Blip‚Äôs unsolicited advice became a constant source of amusement and mild irritation.

""Skye, are you sure about rerouting the plasma conduits like that?"" Tanner would ask, wrench in hand.

""Relax, Knox,"" Skye would retort, sparks flying from her welding torch. ""I know what I'm doing.""

""Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will!"" Blip would interject from Piper‚Äôs shoulder.

The Stardust Drifter slowly transformed under Skye‚Äôs expert touch. Engines were stripped down and rebuilt with experimental components, shields were reinforced with scavenged military-grade plating, and a ludicrously oversized booster engine was jury-rigged to the rear. It was a patchwork masterpiece, held together by ingenuity, stubbornness, and a whole lot of duct tape.

Finally, the day arrived for registration. The spaceport of Port Obscura buzzed with a chaotic mix of heavily modified racers, their eccentric crews, and shady bookmakers. Piper, her forged ID ‚Äì ""Penny Larkspur, independent transport specialist"" ‚Äì feeling flimsy in her sweaty palm, stood in line. Blip, perched precariously on her shoulder, offered his usual unwavering support.

""Believe in your authentic self‚Ä¶ even if it's a little bit fabricated!"" he whispered as a stern-looking race official with cybernetic eyes scanned her credentials. The official‚Äôs gaze lingered on her face for a moment too long, making Piper‚Äôs heart pound. But after a tense silence, he grunted and stamped her entry form.

As Piper breathed a sigh of relief, a figure detached itself from the bustling crowd. Tall and cloaked, their face obscured by shadow, they watched her with an unnerving stillness. As Piper turned, a sliver of light caught a distinctive scar on their hand ‚Äì a scar she knew all too well. A cold smirk spread across the figure's hidden face. They knew it was her. They knew it was Piper Lane.

1ksihne,https://i.redd.it/sp33sowbl92f1.png,The Haphazard Wood Pile Encounter,"Hey guys,
After Gurglegut and the Gray Butcher encounters turned out to be a little lackluster, even with a few changes done by me, I decided to focus on the Haphazad Wood Pile Encounter and make it scenic, hectic, and interactive. I think I did a good job, overall, so here are a few things I added/changed. 

1. Obviously, put some effort into creating an interactive maze of stacked lumber (Jenga pieces work perfectly!), and few falled trees, and of course, the haphazard Pile. It's larger and more vertical here. The vertical and horizontal surfaces were a fun and challenging addition since I have characters with different mobilities - a monk (via Qi Rush), a tripkee investigator, and a hungerseed orc who could become large. Our Oracle used her Inside Ropes to provide a gross way to climb up the SAW-like contraption (made of coffee stirrers,  toothpicks, chopsticks, and wooden dowels and skewers). It even had an arm (able to move up and down thanks to some magnets) with a cage.
2. I ran the encounter as a Complex Hazard requiring 3 successes. Our Kitsune Rogue was the only one with the skillset to fix it - he had all three skills trained!
3. There were other challenges happening since the other players needed some things to do. In addition to the complex hazard, I ran two Jinkins gremlins with Animated Kites. This allowed the Jinkins to be a thorn in the side and attack from odd angles - one was on top of the wood pile, another was one the ground. I mostly used the kites to try and decapitate people with the string 2-action: they were attatched to the Jinkin miniatures via thin wire. One kite had a basket with two vipers on it which a Jinkin shot above the players. The vipers were great and dodging players, slithering away and even climbing up the Inside Ropes to follow the rogue. I also had a trapped Doctor ""Dami"" inside a hanging cage. He was actually wrapped in silk inside a hollow in one of the trees: his ""double"" was an Animated Bamboo Figure wearing the Doctor's clothes. Our Monk Crit Failed a Perception check, and tried to break the bamboo cage, only to be Grabbed by the figure, triggering a spring loaded catapult which sent the monk flying to the opposite end of the map (taking 24 Bludgeoning damage! Ouch!). I had the Bamboo figure die in the crash. 
4. There were also some standard Bear traps which they never encountered or triggered.

I've had prior fast food barista experience (Starbucks and Einstein Bros Bagels, lol) so I have been offered to come along with this project in the future.

I am coming here to ask if anyone works at any of the few USA locations, and how do you like it? As well as anyone in the UK locations? How are the systems, how's the learning curve, etc. I've heard they're a top chain in the UK, however doing some research on this sub, i've seen more negatives than positives. I am also wondering how big and profitable this chain will be in the USA? There's lots of competition in my area with Starbies, 7Brew is coming, DBros, Ziggis, and other fast coffee chains I'm sure I'm forgetting. I like my current job as a QSR manager, however, the future of the brand is uncertain and I am much more interested in coffee and making drinks as opposed to making food.

As a teenager I began restoring it, put all my free time, energy, and money into it. Every bolt, every bit of polish, every little upgrade meant everything to me then. I remember my 19th birthday when me and my dad went for a trip to buy the GS bonnet and grill. It was a day to remember once it was all bolted up. The time I found bumpers with over riders at a local wreckers. I did a fricking rain dance when I came from work one day, and a pair of chrome bonnet scoops dad picked up that day were gleaming at me from the lounge room coffee table.

# Illuminate Your Smile: Explore the Art of Teeth Whitening Treatment in Nassau County at Philip M. Tornatore, DDS

**Introduction to Teeth Whitening**

Teeth whitening is more than just a cosmetic upgrade‚Äîit‚Äôs a transformation. At its core, teeth whitening is a simple, non-invasive dental treatment that lightens the color of your natural teeth and removes stains or discoloration. It‚Äôs one of the most popular and accessible cosmetic dental procedures today, and for good reason: nothing boosts confidence quite like a brilliant white smile.

Whether it‚Äôs years of coffee, tea, red wine, or even medications, our teeth inevitably become discolored over time. Whitening treatments use specialized bleaching agents, typically hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, to break down stains and brighten your teeth several shades whiter. But the method and expertise behind that process make all the difference‚Äîand that‚Äôs where Philip M. Tornatore, DDS, comes in.

With personalized treatment plans and scientifically-backed techniques, Dr. Phil DDS doesn‚Äôt just whiten teeth‚Äîhe enhances smiles in a way that‚Äôs safe, effective, and customized just for you.

**Why It's More Popular Than Ever**

In today‚Äôs image-conscious world, first impressions matter. Whether you're heading to a job interview, preparing for a wedding, or just want to feel more confident day-to-day, a bright smile can make a world of difference. Social media has also played a huge role in the growing popularity of teeth whitening, with picture-perfect smiles now just a swipe away.

People are more aware than ever of how their smiles impact their appearance and self-esteem. And thanks to advances in dental technology, whitening has become more affordable, more effective, and more accessible than ever before. It‚Äôs no longer a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a smart investment in your personal and professional image.

**Meet Dr. Philip M. Tornatore: The Smile Specialist of Nassau County**

Dr. Philip M. Tornatore is more than just a dentist‚Äîhe‚Äôs a staple of Nassau County's dental community. With decades of experience in general and cosmetic dentistry, his practice has become a trusted destination for patients seeking top-tier dental care with a personal touch.

He stays up to date with the latest advancements in cosmetic dentistry, regularly attending professional development courses and integrating modern technology into his practice. From whitening to full smile makeovers, his goal is always the same: help each patient achieve a radiant, healthy smile that reflects their true personality.

What sets Dr. Phil DDS apart is not just his clinical skill but his deep commitment to patient satisfaction. He takes the time to understand each patient's goals, concerns, and lifestyle before recommending any treatment. That‚Äôs why his whitening treatments are as unique as the smiles they improve.

**Patient-Centered Care with a Personal Touch**

Walking into Dr. Phil DDS‚Äôs clinic feels more like visiting a friend than a typical dentist‚Äôs office. The warm staff, soothing environment, and one-on-one attention help create a calm and welcoming experience from the moment you arrive.

Patients rave about how comfortable and informed they feel throughout their whitening journey. Dr. Phil DDS and his team ensure that every question is answered, every procedure is explained, and every result exceeds expectations. It‚Äôs this attention to detail and compassion that keeps patients coming back‚Äîand recommending the practice to friends and family across Nassau County.

**The Science Behind Teeth Discoloration**

**Common Causes of Stained Teeth**

You brush, you floss, you do everything right‚Äîso why aren‚Äôt your teeth white? The truth is, staining is a natural process, and several everyday factors contribute to it:

* **Food and Drinks:**¬†Coffee, tea, wine, berries, and even tomato sauces are notorious for leaving behind pigments.
* **Tobacco Use:**¬†Smoking or chewing tobacco introduces tar and nicotine into your mouth, both of which stain teeth.
* **Poor Oral Hygiene:**¬†Skipping regular cleanings or brushing improperly allows plaque and stain-causing substances to build up.
* **Medications:**¬†Certain antibiotics like tetracycline can cause discoloration, especially when taken during childhood.

Even if you avoid most of these, time itself plays a role in darkening your smile.

**How Aging and Lifestyle Affect Your Smile**

As we age, the outer layer of our enamel wears away, revealing the yellowish dentin underneath. This is why teeth tend to look darker with time, even if you‚Äôve never smoked or sipped red wine. Genetics also play a part‚Äîsome people naturally have more porous enamel that stains more easily.

Lifestyle habits like diet, stress (which affects oral hygiene), and hydration levels can also impact the color of your teeth. Understanding these factors is the first step in choosing the right whitening approach‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what¬†**Dr. Phil DDS‚Äôs**¬†expert consultations are designed to do.

**Teeth Whitening Options Offered at Philip M. Tornatore‚Äôs Clinic**

**In-Office Professional Whitening**

When you‚Äôre looking for immediate, dramatic results, nothing beats professional in-office whitening. At¬†**Dr. Phil DDS**‚Äôs clinic, this treatment uses a high-concentration whitening gel activated by a special light or laser to accelerate the bleaching process. The procedure takes about an hour and can lighten your teeth by several shades in just one visit.

Unlike store-bought kits, the professional version ensures even coverage and minimal sensitivity. Plus, because it‚Äôs supervised by a trained dentist, the treatment is completely safe and tailored to your specific dental history.

For those preparing for a special event or just wanting that instant wow-factor, in-office whitening is the gold standard.

**At-Home Whitening Kits: Custom Solutions**

Prefer the comfort of whitening your teeth at home?¬†**Dr. Phil DDS**¬†offers custom at-home kits that combine convenience with professional-grade results. These kits include personalized trays made from impressions of your teeth, ensuring a perfect fit and optimal contact with the whitening gel.

The gel used in these take-home kits is stronger and safer than what you‚Äôll find in over-the-counter options. Most patients see noticeable results within one to two weeks of consistent use, and because the process is gradual, there‚Äôs a reduced risk of sensitivity.

It‚Äôs a great option for patients with busy schedules or those who want to maintain the results of their in-office treatment.

**Whitening Toothpastes vs. Professional Treatments**

Let‚Äôs clear up a common myth: whitening toothpaste can‚Äôt replace professional treatments. These products typically contain mild abrasives or low concentrations of peroxide that can remove surface stains but do little for deeper discoloration.

**Dr. Phil DDS**¬†may recommend specific whitening toothpaste to help maintain your results post-treatment, but they‚Äôre not a substitute for the real thing. Think of them as supportive tools in your long-term whitening strategy, not the main event.

**Step-by-Step: What to Expect from a Whitening Appointment**

**Initial Consultation and Shade Assessment**

The teeth whitening journey at¬†[**Dr. Philip M. Tornatore‚Äô**](https://www.drphildds.com/a-guide-to-the-best-teeth-whitening-treatment-in-nassau-county/)s clinic begins with a comprehensive consultation. This initial step is vital in determining the right whitening solution for you. During this visit, Dr. Phil DDS takes the time to evaluate your oral health, review your dental history, and assess your current tooth shade using a precise shade guide.

This shade assessment helps set realistic expectations for your results. It also serves as a ‚Äúbefore‚Äù reference so you can truly see the transformation post-treatment. Dr. Phil DDS will discuss your whitening goals, whether you're looking to make a subtle improvement or achieve a dramatically whiter smile.

Patients love this step because it's interactive and informative. You're not just handed a treatment‚Äîyou‚Äôre educated about how the process works, what results you can expect, and how long they‚Äôll last.

**Prepping the Teeth for Whitening**

Before the whitening gel is applied, your teeth are thoroughly cleaned to remove any plaque or debris. This ensures the gel can penetrate evenly and work more effectively. Dr. Phil DDS‚Äôs team also takes precautions to protect your gums, lips, and surrounding tissues using a special barrier gel and retraction tools.

If you‚Äôre undergoing in-office whitening, you‚Äôll be comfortably reclined while the dental team prepares your mouth for treatment. Your comfort is a priority‚Äîexpect a pain-free and stress-free experience from start to finish.

For those opting for custom at-home trays, this is also when impressions are taken of your teeth. These molds are then used to create trays that fit your mouth perfectly, giving you a professional-level result from the comfort of your home.

**The Whitening Procedure Itself**

Once your mouth is prepped, the magic begins. Dr. Phil DDS applies a professional-grade whitening gel to the surfaces of your teeth. For in-office treatments, this gel is typically activated with a specialized LED light, which accelerates the bleaching process and enhances results.

The whitening session is typically broken into multiple 15- to 20-minute intervals, depending on your sensitivity and desired results. Between intervals, the gel may be reapplied to maintain its strength. Most patients report only mild warmth or tingling sensations‚Äîno pain, no discomfort.

After the final round, your mouth is rinsed, and Dr. Phil DDS will compare your current shade to the one we started with. You‚Äôll be amazed at how much brighter and cleaner your smile looks‚Äîand you‚Äôll feel the difference in your confidence immediately.

**Is Teeth Whitening Safe? Separating Myths from Facts**

**Understanding Sensitivity and Side Effects**

Teeth whitening is a safe and effective procedure when performed by a licensed dental professional. At Dr. Phil DDS‚Äôs clinic, patient safety is the top priority. All products used are approved by the American Dental Association (ADA), and treatments are carefully customized to minimize risk.

That said, some people do experience temporary sensitivity, especially during the first few hours after treatment. This is completely normal and usually fades within 24 to 48 hours. Dr. Phil DDS provides a sensitivity-reducing gel or toothpaste when necessary and offers guidance on how to avoid triggering discomfort post-treatment.

Other minor side effects may include slight gum irritation or a tingling feeling on the teeth‚Äîagain, these are short-lived and manageable. Rest assured, the whitening process at this clinic is conducted under careful supervision, using only the safest, most effective methods.

**Who Should Avoid Whitening Treatments?**

While most people are good candidates for teeth whitening, it‚Äôs not recommended for everyone. Here are a few instances where Dr. Phil DDS may suggest an alternative:

* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women**: While not proven harmful, whitening is typically postponed as a precaution.
* **Patients with gum disease or cavities**: These should be treated first to prevent sensitivity or further damage.
* **People with dental restorations**: Crowns, veneers, and fillings won‚Äôt whiten like natural teeth, so Dr. Phil DDS may recommend other cosmetic options.

A consultation with Dr. Phil DDS ensures that your dental health is prioritized before any whitening treatment begins. You‚Äôll receive honest advice tailored to your specific situation.

**How Long Do Whitening Results Last?**

**Factors That Influence Longevity**

The longevity of your whitening results depends on several factors, including your diet, oral hygiene habits, and the original level of staining. On average, professional whitening results can last anywhere from six months to two years, especially when paired with good maintenance practices.

If you're someone who frequently enjoys coffee, red wine, or tobacco, your teeth may start to discolor more quickly. That‚Äôs why Dr. Phil DDS provides custom follow-up plans to help you prolong your results. These can include touch-up treatments, routine cleanings, and lifestyle recommendations that keep your smile bright.

Genetics also play a role. Some people naturally have enamel that holds onto whiteness longer, while others may experience faster relapse. Either way, Dr. Phil DDS tailors your aftercare plan based on your individual needs.

**How to Maintain a Whiter Smile**

Want to get the most out of your teeth whitening treatment? Here are Dr. Phil DDS‚Äôs top recommendations:

* **Avoid stain-causing foods and drinks**: Especially in the first 48 hours post-treatment.
* **Use a straw**: When drinking coffee or soda, a straw can limit contact with your teeth.
* **Brush and floss regularly**: Twice a day brushing and daily flossing go a long way.
* **Rinse after meals**: Water helps flush away pigment-rich particles.
* **Touch-up treatments**: Schedule occasional in-office or at-home touch-ups every 6 to 12 months.

With the right maintenance and guidance, your newly whitened smile will continue to shine for years.

**Comparing Teeth Whitening Methods: In-Office vs. Over-the-Counter**

**Pros and Cons of Each Method**

When it comes to teeth whitening, you‚Äôve got options‚Äîbut not all options deliver the same results. Let‚Äôs compare in-office whitening by Dr. Philip M. Tornatore with common over-the-counter methods.

**In-Office Whitening (Professional Treatment):**  
**Pros:**

* Fast results (noticeable in just one session)
* Supervised by a dental professional
* Customized to your dental condition
* Longer-lasting effects
* Reduced risk of gum irritation or tooth sensitivity

**Cons:**

* Higher initial cost (but more effective overall)
* Requires an appointment

**Over-the-Counter Whitening (Strips, Trays, Gels):**  
**Pros:**

* Readily available at pharmacies
* Budget-friendly upfront
* Convenient for at-home use

**Cons:**

* Lower concentration of active ingredients
* Inconsistent results
* Increased risk of sensitivity and gum irritation
* May take weeks to see minor improvements

While over-the-counter options may seem appealing due to their accessibility, they often lack the potency and safety measures of professional treatments. With Dr. Phil DDS, you receive tailored care that ensures both stunning and safe results.

**Why Professional Treatment Yields Better Results**

Professional whitening treatments are backed by science and experience.¬†**Philip M. Tornatore, DDS**¬†uses ADA-approved products with a higher concentration of bleaching agents, which means faster and more reliable whitening. You also benefit from precision application and protection for your gums and enamel‚Äîsomething store-bought kits can‚Äôt offer.

Plus, there‚Äôs the added peace of mind in knowing that if any issues arise‚Äîlike sensitivity or uneven results‚Äîyou‚Äôre in the care of an expert who can address them immediately. Professional treatment is an investment not just in appearance, but in quality, comfort, and dental health.

**Ideal Candidates for Teeth Whitening at Philip M. Tornatore**

**Who Benefits the Most?**

Teeth whitening is ideal for anyone looking to boost their confidence and brighten their smile. Whether you're preparing for a special event or simply want to look your best, you‚Äôre likely a great candidate if:

* Your teeth are healthy with no untreated cavities or gum disease
* You have surface-level or age-related staining
* You have realistic expectations and want to enhance your natural smile
* You are committed to maintaining your results with good oral hygiene

Many of Dr. Phil‚Äôs patients report feeling more youthful and self-assured after whitening‚Äîand the treatment is quick enough to fit into any schedule.

**Conditions That Might Require Alternative Treatments**

However, whitening isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all solution. Some conditions may affect how well your teeth respond:

* **Intrinsic stains**¬†(from medications like tetracycline) are more resistant to whitening.
* **Fluorosis**¬†(white or brown spots caused by fluoride exposure) might not respond evenly.
* **Dental restorations**¬†(crowns, veneers, fillings) don‚Äôt change color and may need replacement to match your new tooth shade.

During your consultation, Dr. Phil DDS evaluates these factors and may recommend alternative cosmetic options like veneers or bonding for optimal results.

**Real Patient Experiences at Dr. Philip M. Tornatore, DDS‚Äôs Clinic**

**Before and After Success Stories**

There‚Äôs nothing more inspiring than seeing the real-life impact of a brightened smile. Dr. Phil DDS‚Äôs patients frequently share how their whitening experience exceeded their expectations‚Äînot only in appearance but in how it made them feel.

One Nassau County resident, Sarah M., says:  
*‚ÄúI never realized how dull my smile had become until I saw the ‚Äòafter‚Äô photos. I felt like I had turned back the clock 10 years. Dr.Phil DDS‚Äôs team was incredible throughout the process.‚Äù*

Another patient, James T., explains:  
*‚ÄúI had a job interview and wanted to look my best. The whitening treatment gave me a huge confidence boost‚Äîand yes, I got the job!‚Äù*

These stories are a testament to the clinic‚Äôs commitment to quality and personalized care. Each whitening journey is unique, and Dr. Phil DDS ensures it ends with a smile that‚Äôs not just whiter‚Äîbut genuinely happier.

While the exact cost can vary depending on your chosen method and treatment plan, the clinic ensures full transparency from the beginning‚Äîno hidden fees, no surprise charges.

With so many flexible options, there‚Äôs no reason to put off the smile you‚Äôve always wanted.

**Post-Whitening Care: Tips for Long-Lasting Results**

**Foods to Avoid After Whitening**

The 48 hours following your teeth whitening treatment are critical. Your enamel is more porous during this period, making your teeth more susceptible to staining. Dr. Phil DDS always advises patients to follow the ‚Äúwhite diet‚Äù immediately after treatment. That means sticking to foods and drinks that are colorless or light in shade.

**Avoid the following:**

* Coffee and tea
* Red wine and dark sodas
* Tomato-based sauces
* Berries and beets
* Soy sauce and balsamic vinegar

These can quickly undo your results and leave you feeling disappointed. If you must indulge, use a straw and rinse your mouth with water afterward to limit the staining effects.

**Recommended Oral Hygiene Practices**

To maintain that glowing smile, good oral hygiene is a must. Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a whitening toothpaste (as recommended by Dr. Phil DDS), and floss daily to remove stain-causing plaque and debris from between teeth. Consider using an electric toothbrush for a more thorough clean.

You should also schedule regular dental cleanings every six months, which will not only preserve your whitening results but also ensure your overall oral health is in check.

Dr. Phil DDS may also recommend occasional whitening touch-ups, especially if you‚Äôre a frequent coffee or wine drinker. These touch-ups are quick, easy, and help keep your smile looking fresh all year long.

**Scheduling Your Teeth Whitening Consultation**

**How to Book Your Appointment**

I am from law background and don't know anything about Finance as a field.

1) My question is that when a person gets nothing out of doing a favour why will they do a favour from women who they don't have ulterior motives for (my girlfriend accepted that they will have a ulterior motives but says that there is no other way to get reference and get higher positions in other companies) 

2) If they have ulterior motives like getting sexual favours how will those motives die and they won't want to have those favours after they do the favour due to the motive and ensure that the girl works in the same company or the same office or in the same team with them. Will they not want to get those favours anymore and if they will do how will the women be safe.

3) I suppose it won't end with one coffee or lunch and they (the senior male) would want to go on lunches dinners and ask for the same as a token of thanks after doing the favour on the woman. So, is it invalid for me to have concerns with my wife going on lunches and dinners with a person like that.

4) Is there any solution for this problem as she told me that there is no other way to get promotions or references for other jobs as due to patriarchy and men sitting on the senior positions, they won't want to let women be on such positions instead of man and even if the women is deserving and competent, it doesn't matter as she will not be able to get what she deserves due to how the industry is and she has to do it for her future? I don't want her to compromise in her career man, she is great, very deserving.

As I said- she is still a student, she is also looking for advice and suggestions. She is bright and a deserving student.

I am a 19F and I think I may have some type of mitochondrial disease. Since I was 10, I had frequent migraines, which resulted in cyclic vomiting cycle.

I also faint very frequently, especially going from sitting to standing and in hot showers. The doctor's think I have vasovagal syncope, but the tilt-test did not indicate that.

I have a longish story that happened just 3 hours ago.

To start I (33F) and my husband T(32M) have been married 5 years and have a blended family with 7 kiddos. This story only involves my 4 daughters S (13), K(11), A(7) and H(3).
It all started when I was visiting and talking with T's 15 yr old sister C. C had mentioned she was trying to earn money over the summer doing odd jobs and she was telling me different jobs she could do I offered / asked if she wanted to watch my girls today for an hour while I went to the tattoo shop to get my tattoo touched up. She agreed, so we planned on when she would come over etc. At 5 pm C comes over where are then walk her through the kids' routine let her know that I had already fed the children got them in their pajamas, what shows their allowed to watch and ones they are allowed to watch, their bed times etc. everything goes smoothly and make sure they're all settled in and good to go then I leave for my appointment. My tattoo shop is about 30 minutes from my house so I drive there I get there I text C and S to check in and see how everyone's doing they said everyone's good it's all good. Then about 10 minutes after that I get a gut feeling that I need to look at my security cameras. I open up my security cameras swipe down to the living room camera and I see Gertrude (30) T's other sister. (He has 3) And I then check my phone to see if I missed a text or call from her where she's letting me know that she is swinging by I have no messages from her, I then message my daughter S. I ask her hey what is Gertrude doing there my daughter then responds I don't know, I then text his other sister Alli (28). I said "" Gretrude is at my house right now."" To which Alli responded with wtf?!
I then call my daughter S, when she answers I ask her "" hey why haven't you texted me back why is she there did she say anything.?"" My daughter responds with ""I don't know she just showed up."" While I'm talking to my daughter I hear Gertrude in the background yelling at S ""who's that?""-"" why did you call your mom?""-""why did you call your mom?"" All the while chasing my daughter through our house. My daughter tells her "" I didn't my mom called me."" I then tell S go to your room let me call C and see what's going on. Hang up with my daughter and then immediately call C she picks up on the second ring and ""I'm like hey what's going on?"" and then she tells me "" she just walked in I don't know why she's here she is just yelling at me about babysitting."" I tell her she shouldn't be there and then ask C to take the phone to Gertrude. C brings the phone to Gertrude and says ""it's Jess"" Gertrude answers the phone in a puppy chirpy little tone "" Hey"" I say "" what's up?"" Gertrude:"" what do you mean?"" Me :"" why are you at my house when I'm not there, you need to leave"" Gertrude :"" I'm their aunt I thought it was okay."" Me "" But you didn't ask to come over and I'm not home please leave "" Gertrude"" Fine!"" Then hangs up on me slamming C's iPhone 16 on the coffee table and storms out and slams my front door. ( I reviewed cameras and my kids told me what happened.) Not 3 minutes later I get a phone call from MiL. I picked it up already knowing what was going to happen or so I thought. I answer the phone with a hello MiL starts by screaming at me "" how could you do that to Gertrude?"" Me: "" I just asked her to leave my home "" MiL :"" she's family why would you do that ."" She then proceeded to scream profanities at me to which I hang up on her. She calls back I answer and say "" nope your not going to call me and scream at me, nope not happening."" I hang up, she calls back, I answer and immediately hang up, she calls again I reject the call. Then my phone pings MiL texts ""C won't be watching the kids for you. I can not believe you would do Gertrude like that.""- Me: ""I can't believe that you're mad that she went to my house without asking and then I said she needed to ask first."" MiL:"" You have 30 minutes to be home. You don't treat family like that!""- Me:"" She didn't ask to come over "" MiL: ""It shouldn't matter! Don't worry none of is well come anymore!!."" Me:"" Dude "" MiL :""Your time is running out to get home "" Me:"" All I said was ask first."" MiL :"" This is my daughter you hurt and treated like she's not family.""-"" You told her to leave because she didn't ask."" Me:"" I didn't treat her like non-family, I just asked her  to not show up uninvited especially when I'm not home "" MiL :"" did you or did you not ask her to leave because she didn't ask 1st?"" Me :"" well yes, family or not it's the polite thing to do.""-"" I didn't do anything wrong by asking her to leave my home."" MiL :"" WTF ever! This is not how you treat family . Like I said get  home or Im going to wait with the girls "" Me:"" No.""-"" I am going home but you don't get to demand things of me.""-""It's common knowledge that T and I both don't like people just coming over and letting themselves into our home."" MiL:""Don't worry we won't ever come over again!!!"" Me:"" Gertrude never does come over she only did cause C was babysitting and she just walked in not even asking or telling me hey I'm at your house."" MiL ""Don't bother texting me back I'm done with this conversation and you "" Me "" Bye.""
It was during this that I called Alli and asked her to go to my house and be with my kids and keep MiL from entering my home. Alli got there just before T and I did (T was at work ) and C had to go home. I called T on his drive home and filled him in and he agreed with me and said basically the same thing I did. I get home and Alli is there and had C with her, C tells me about all the trash talk MiL and T's grandmother and spouting about me, she even records it and shows me, T and Alli. MiL is livid and talking about how horrible I am and I shouldn't have had so many kids etc. Gertrude had spung the whole thing and was making up all kinds of lies. I break down in tears because of the horrible things and how this all turned out, I find out from Alli that she too talked to her mother and her mother is super pissed at her, and says Alli is only siding with me because of her crush on me? News to me and Alli is married to a man so um yeah. So now T, me and Alli are evil and horrid and I'm banned from seeing C. After Alli and C leave I go over my camera footage and see Gertrude let herself in and punch my dog in the face! Yeah she fucking punched my husky in the face, she then starts grilling my kids about where their parents are and snooping through my house taking pictures of my house etc. I save all the recording and show T. He says "" we just will cut ties with them "" so I go on all social media to block MiL when I see she made a post about "" Family my ass"" I then block her, her mother and all family on that side except Alli and C. I am sorry it was so long but am I the Ahole?",17,1747888152.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,9,0.85,False

I‚Äôm just overthinking about what happened a while ago. I got a call and I was able to say my opening spiel but I accidentally fell asleep for 20-30 seconds and the customer was wondering if the line dropped but then I responded again acting like I had to do something, I continued to assist but the customer became irate. Luckily enough, the concern was something out of my scope and is required to be transferred to a different department. I‚Äôm wondering now if the customer would file a complaint or if that call will get audited.

Honestly, nakatulog ako kasi sobrang pagod ako lagi tuwing may pasok. I only get 3-4 hours of sleep and heavily relying on coffee and energy drinks.

1 hour para gumayak such as makaligo, kumain, etc. Papunta and pauwi is a total of 4 hours of travel. 10 hours shift (including mandatory 1 hour preshift). Hindi naman ako pwede matulog agad paguwi kasi I live with my grandparents kaya ako na din nagaasikaso sa ibang household chores. Included na din jan ang short time to use my phone to relax in bed.

I‚Äôve gone a week eating only plain grilled chicken and fruit, but without fail, everyday, I wake up in intense pain. 

My symptoms are worst in the morning, I‚Äôm almost always woken up by my bowels screaming at me as early as 5am. But after I use the restroom, it continues, for hours. No going back to sleep. It‚Äôs just bubbly guts, cramping, discomfort, gas, and bloating. I feel like I have a ton of gas built up in my chest but stuff like gas x doesn‚Äôt help at all. 

I‚Äôve been given numerous medications all of which help the pain subside for a few hours, but I‚Äôve been dealing with this for almost 3 years now. And I will try and do just about anything to get this to fixed. 

I currently have to drive around for work almost everyday and I don‚Äôt get to eat consistent meals and half the time my body won‚Äôt let me eat.

1kshyt1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kshyt1,Can anyone tell me what these rings are on the roof of my mouth?,"So a bit iflver 4 weeks ago the inside of my mouth became itchy. A couple of days after the itch started I looked in the mirror and noticed a few red dots on the roof of my mouth. This progressed to more red spots on the roof and on the back of my throat and my uvula. 

My tongue began to sting as though I had ulcers or small cuts on it. It would especially sting when I drank hot coffee. I haven't seen any ulcers pop up on my tongue however. I have though had small sores pop up on either side of my mouth which can be seen by the red arrows in the picture. My tongue only stung for the first week of so and doesn't any more. 

I have been back and forth from my GP getting swabs and blood tests but everything has been negative so far. They have said something about lesions on my throat. 

These white circles haveappeared in the past 2 days. There were random lines and circles before but they appear worse and a lot more now. It could be from me rubbing my tongue on my itchy spots but it's not something I do constantly just every now and again. 

Other symptoms have been a sore throat like tonsillitis sore for a couple of random days on maybe week 2 or 3. Feeling super tired and lethargic for a week on perhaps week 2. Itchy lips and around my lips. 

A little more detail is that the GP suggested herpes. I have never had herpes before. However I had unprotected sex with a guy a couple of weeks before this happened. Upon asking him a week ago he admitted he does have herpes. I am still hoping it's not herpes and I'll be sad if it is but also an answer would be nice. 

I've added several photos that show the progress of the oral rash. The one with the red arrows is how it is today.

1kshx3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beyondthebylines/comments/1kshx3e/crappy_meal_fast_food_workers_cannot_afford_to_eat/,Crappy Meal: Fast Food Workers Cannot Afford To Eat,"https://preview.redd.it/pa2r8o3pe92f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=042f3f4af5d578b9fefdb5e66e3c33c560a83c51

In a world where grabbing a quick combo meal has long symbolized affordability and convenience, a startling new reality is emerging: the very workers who serve your fast food may not be able to afford it themselves.

According to a¬†**LendingTree**¬†report based on recent U.S. labor statistics, the cost of a fast food meal has grown so steep that the people preparing your burgers and fries have to work¬†**twice as long**¬†as the average American just to buy what they make.

# Fast Food, Slow Pay: A Working-Class Disparity

https://preview.redd.it/7erfzckqe92f1.jpg?width=878&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebd886733a76c342f35db515be9455748d0f0abc

The average cost of a fast food combo meal in the U.S. is now¬†**$11.56**. A fast food worker‚Äîearning an average wage of¬†**$15.08 per hour**‚Äîneeds to work¬†**46 minutes**¬†just to afford that single meal.

By contrast, the average U.S. worker, making¬†**$32.82 an hour**, can afford that same meal in just¬†**21.2 minutes**.

This growing gap is more than a financial inconvenience; it's a reflection of deep systemic inequality. The people providing some of the most consumed meals in America can no longer participate in the very system they sustain.

# üåÜ¬†City by City: Where Fast Food Hurts the Most

https://preview.redd.it/cd9ruorse92f1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=933d8be0c5c658e0018ee33a54c208f3361e4f9f

The problem becomes more pronounced in America's largest urban centers:

* **San Francisco**¬†tops the chart with the highest average fast food combo price:¬†**$12.73**. Even though the city has the highest minimum wage in the country at¬†**$20.67/hour**, fast food workers still need to work¬†**36.9 minutes**¬†for a meal. Meanwhile, other professionals earning the city‚Äôs average wage of¬†**$48.15/hour**¬†need just¬†**15.9 minutes**.
* **New York City**¬†and¬†**Los Angeles**¬†follow closely with meal prices of¬†**$12.25**¬†and¬†**$12.24**, respectively.
* **Seattle**¬†rounds out the top four at¬†**$12.22**¬†per combo.

Compare this to¬†**Indianapolis**, where the average meal is¬†**just $9.19**, making it the cheapest city in the survey. Yet even there, the average fast food employee has to work¬†**39.4 minutes**¬†to afford a meal‚Äîstill nearly double the¬†**18.2 minutes**¬†required by the city‚Äôs average wage earner.

# üí∏¬†Inflation Isn‚Äôt the Only Culprit

While general inflation is often blamed for rising costs, the fast food sector is under a unique strain from global economic shifts.

Last month,¬†**President Trump‚Äôs new global tariffs**¬†went into effect. Many of the products fast food chains rely on‚Äîbeef, palm oil, coffee‚Äîare now more expensive. For instance,¬†**McDonald‚Äôs sources much of its beef from Australia**, which is now subject to a¬†**10% tariff**.

The result?¬†**Menu prices will likely rise further**, making it even harder for low-wage workers to afford their own meals.

# üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†The Janitor‚Äôs Dilemma

To understand this paradox more clearly, imagine a janitor at a luxury hotel.

Every morning, he meticulously scrubs floors, polishes marble, and ensures five-star restrooms remain pristine for high-paying guests. He sees opulence daily‚Äîspa menus, champagne carts, $400-a-night rooms‚Äîbut when his shift ends, he exits through the back alley.

This is what it's like for many fast food workers:¬†**laboring in the heart of America‚Äôs convenience culture**, yet excluded from the benefits it offers.

# ü§î¬†Why This Matters

Fast food workers are not just teens with after-school jobs. According to the¬†**Bureau of Labor Statistics**,¬†**more than 50%**¬†are¬†**over the age of 25**, and¬†**30% are raising children**.

These are adults feeding families, often working multiple jobs. And as prices rise and wages stagnate, many are being priced out of their own livelihoods.

Fast food was never meant to be luxurious. But now, for the workers inside the kitchen, it‚Äôs becoming a¬†**symbol of exclusion**‚Äîa place they labor in but cannot afford to enjoy.

# üîç¬†A System in Need of Rethinking

As labor costs, supply chain instability, and inflation converge, America must ask itself:

* **Should fast food be a luxury item for the working poor?**
* **Should the people preparing our food have to choose between eating it and paying rent?**
* **And how sustainable is an economy where the front-line workers can't afford basic consumption?**

These aren't just policy questions‚Äîthey're moral ones.
