Right now is one of those times. I am office lead. 

She tries talking to me all the time, I noted 15 times in 1 hour. These are things such as ""I made a milkshake last night"", ""What do you think of recycled clothing a yes or a no, I buy it"",  even interrupting the manager to share with me, how we are similar because of something she has noticed I do.  She narrates what I am doing, gives me praise, makes assumptions about me, my motives for anything, my likes and dislikes even after correcting her. She also keeps track of my work load and what I am doing, also makes assumptions about these, ""you only changed this up because HR made you"", when no it was my own decision and design. 

She has been finding jobs to do directly outside my office door, and talks really loudly, I catch her reflection in the clock and she is often peering through. She told me last week that she notices I drink coffee during lunch, that I tap my fingers when thinking, chew on my pen, and about three other things. She finished with ""I notice things about you"".  and will wait to I go to leave to tell me important issues, despite talking all day. When I do something wrong, or she has been successful in interrupting me or preventing me from doing my job, she smiles and says ""ha"", or ""Well I was just trying to be nice"". During these ""friendly times"", (this is her being positive, which is actually toxic), she is often spreading lies and words about me, others know not to listen to her. However, addressing these issues is never good for anyone. 

Lately, whenever I hear her voice, or see her my stress levels jump. I have the day off today and I cannot stop thinking of these interactions with her. Yesterday I had so much work to do, but I could hear her voice, and I couldn't concentrate. I don't know how to ignore this.",1,1746232907.0,Stress,0,1.0,False

1kdg8lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kdg8lx/sf_thomas_bratfords_eulogy/,[SF] Thomas Bratford's Eulogy,"We are here today in remembrance of Thomas Bratford. Me and Tom grew up together, two scrawny kids scraping knees on the same cracked sidewalks, dreaming up big plans under the same summer skies. He was the kind of friend who‚Äôd always have your back, whether it was sneaking out past curfew or just sitting quiet when words didn‚Äôt cut it. I can still hear his laugh, and I keep expecting to see him walk through the door, cracking some awful joke. But he won‚Äôt. We all know why we‚Äôre here, why there‚Äôs nothing left to bury, just this empty space where Tom used to be. Another name lost to them, another story cut short. It‚Äôs a pain too many of us carry, a hole that doesn‚Äôt heal.

I remember the first time I saw one. Tom and I were riding our bikes down by the local power station, just kids chasing a thrill in a place we weren‚Äôt supposed to be. We saw it‚Äîa flicker of something wrong, a figure that didn‚Äôt belong. We froze, half-scared, half-mesmerized, barely daring to whisper until it passed. I‚Äôll never forget the rush of living to tell the tale, the way we laughed about it later, shaky but proud. From that day, we both had a morbid fascination with them. We‚Äôd wonder what they were, where they came from, trading wild guesses under the stars. Perhaps it was that moment that led Tom to become an anthropologist, to dig into our shared history with them. I confess he knew far more on the matter than I ever did. But he taught me what I cared to learn through our many late-night talks. And so, in his memory, let me share what I came to understand about them.

Nobody knows when they first appeared. What we do know is that as far back as written history goes, we have references to them‚Äîetched in Roman literature, Babylonian tablets, ancient Chinese scrolls, you name it. Across every era and culture, there they were. Nobody knows what they are, though many believe they do. Some believe they are fallen angels, others believe they are demons. Some of the more rational among us believe they may be aliens or travelers from another dimension. They live in our world but don‚Äôt seem to interact with it the way we do. Many have come to believe that they perceive reality differently to us. As if they are living between layers of reality, layers that we cannot comprehend.

There has never been a recorded interaction between us and them. Throughout history, there have been conquerors, kings, and madmen who have attempted and failed miserably to bring them to heel. We will likely never truly understand what they are or what they want. In our modern society, we have come to understand that it is best to give them a wide berth.

From a young age, we are taught safety procedures, the dos and don'ts, the little things to notice. Load of horseshit if you ask me. Anybody who‚Äôs lost somebody gets it. Sometimes bad things happen‚Äîone moment you‚Äôre on a stroll, maybe distracted by a call, and the next‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre gone. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm still struggling to accept it. If even Thomas could fall victim to this, someone who studied them, who knew more than most of us ever will, it makes you wonder what chance the rest of us stand. I‚Äôm sure many of you have similar stories, loved ones taken without warning, without reason. All I can do is reassure you that you are not alone, and remind you to hug your loved ones tight. You never know what tomorrow holds for them.

And that‚Äôs the hardest truth Tom taught me about them‚Äîthey don‚Äôt seem to intend us harm, not in any way we can grasp. They‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ indifferent, as if we‚Äôre not even here. Yet that indifference has cost us countless lives through the years, Tom‚Äôs among them. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre walking down a quiet path and one passes through you, or if you‚Äôre behind the wheel and don‚Äôt see one until it‚Äôs too late. The result is the same‚Äîthere‚Äôs seldom anything left of you. So as we say goodbye to Tom today, let‚Äôs carry that bitter lesson with us. Not to live in fear, but to remember how fragile this life is, how quickly it can be erased by something we‚Äôll never understand.

Thank you for coming out today. I know Tom would have been proud to see so many of your faces here today. Please stay for coffee and discussion afterward as we prepare for the burial.

The timeline spanned from 05.01.2025 to literally all day today (05.02.2025). The client bought a vending machine and will put it in a business condo office. It's the client's first venture into entrepreneurship, filed papers with the secretary of state, and the client needed to get the following coverages at the demand of the property management group:

\-Commercial general liability policy

\-Auto policy with $1M single limit coverage each occurrence

\-Commercial umbrella policy with $5M in coverage each occurrence

\-Workers comp policy (this was waived because there are no employees)

  
I bugged the commercial fire underwriters all damn day today, making sure I was asking everything I needed to ask to make damn sure I understood what I needed to tell the client to guide them through their first business policy. My brain was fried halfway through doing all of this, a $5M commercial umbrella is way above the agency's binding limits so I have to get the business sales leader for the state involved to sign off on this, and the 3 cups of coffee and 1 can of Monster wore off halfway through the day. But here is what I learned doing this:

  
1. Office condos have some insane insurance requirements for tenants but I understand wanting to diminish your liability exposure to near zero.

2. The commercial underwriters are a lot more dry a group than I thought but they can be super helpful if you know what to ask. Don't waste their time.

3. I'm as lost as the client is but I have resources to better answer clients. That's one of the pros of being at a captive agency.

4. I'm still very unconvinced that a trial by fire is the only/best way to learn but sales usually doesn't lend itself to another way to do things. Sometimes it's just gonna suck before you get better at something.

5. Submitting the app is all that matters. Everything before and after that is useless.

All that time I spent with the client and working on business policies makes personal lines seem so inconsequential. I've been wanting to cut my teeth with commercial policies but the carrier I'm at doesn't really want to do commercial (underwriting eligibility guidelines for most business classes are super tight). Unfortunately, the only way out is through and I'm not allowed to quit.

1kdg6q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/intotheradius/comments/1kdg6q6/player_distortion/,Player Distortion,"Crosspost from the Discord because I'm a shameless piggy

I can tell I've been playing the game a lot because I'm dreaming about it. I was dreaming about being in the Radius last night, but I think there were some crossed wires because I was encountering some pockets of radiation out in the wilderness. The mechanics I interacted with to deal with it were pretty much lifted straight from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise, specifically equipping a gas mask (or ADH, same function in the dream), and drinking vodka and smoking cigarettes. Waking up I realized there could be value in a secondary damage mechanic like radiation poisoning, albeit more in-line with ITR lore. Given that distortion as a concept is front and center in how the Radius presents itself and affects the environment of Perchorsk, what if there were a *player* distortion mechanic?

Instead of simply dropping dead when your ADH juice runs out, you begin experiencing the effects of distortion, to varying degrees. I'm not exactly sure what that looks like, but to spitball, perhaps it starts subtle with an altered time scale, missing armor values or reduced movement speed. Some minor debuff that might even be subtle enough to go unnoticed. As distortion advances, you start experiencing like simulated amnesia, where gear on your vest moves to different slots or even to your backpack, disrupting your muscle memory. Maybe your vision is randomly affected. You start encountering enemy spawns that aren't really there, dealing no damage and spawning in groups to waste your ammo and force you to question which threats are worth confronting. Maybe just before succumbing to distortion your body physically alters in some way (extra fingers or hands, mimic style?) or you hear yourself start to spout mimic lines while your health slowly ticks down. Perhaps enemies cease to attack you, seeing you as just another agent of the Radius (Could be potentially really fun as a high-risk/reward gambit?)

Ways to mitigate the effects would be consumables which irl provide some sort of altered mind state, however subtle. I know alcohol isn't in the game and its addition would raise questions with the ESRB and PEGI, but cigarettes \[or cigars (OH PLEASE CMG)\], coffee, or just some kind of designated pharmaceutical. The key (in my head at least), is that these simply treat the *symptoms* of distortion, not the distortion itself. The only way distortion truly recedes is by leaving the exclusion zone, i.e. returning to Facility #27 to see whatever effects rapidly and permanently diminish, until you venture forth once again and come across sources of distortion (perhaps even aside from distortion zones?) in the EZ.

I admit this is a lot, and probably too much to implement to the degree of the vision I have for the mechanic, but I thought given the (outstanding!) community involvement CMG have shown, it'd be worth sharing. I hope at the very least folks might enjoy daydreaming along with me here.",1,1746231986.0,intotheradius,0,1.0,False

I should‚Äôve left it there.

But I didn‚Äôt. I took it home.

And that was my first mistake.

1

The dryer at the laundromat had been eating my quarters for twenty minutes when I noticed the pink fabric peeking out from beneath it. At first, I thought it was just another lost sock‚Äîthis place was a graveyard for single socks‚Äîbut when I tugged, the whole thing came free in one long stretch of cotton.

A onesie.

Size 24 months, if the tag was to be believed.

Pink. Cloud pattern. Slightly damp.

I stared at it, then at the receipt still clinging to it like a desperate ex.

*Zynn Casino‚Äî$4.99 (2 gallons whole milk)*

*Good luck!*

That was it. No name. No number. Just a casino receipt and a baby outfit.

I noted automatically that the Zynn Casino logo had that distinctive saucer shape‚Äîsame as the ""weather balloon"" that crashed in Roswell in '47. Coincidence? Please. I'd seen the classified files.

I folded it neatly and put it in my duffel.

I told myself I‚Äôd return it if I saw anyone looking for it.

And I did.

\---

The lie came later, after the laundromat, after the diner, after the woman with the tired eyes and the toddler clinging to her leg.

She was arguing with the waitress over the price of a strawberry milk‚Äî""It‚Äôs just *milk* with *syrup*, how is that *three dollars*?""‚Äîwhen the kid yanked her pants down.

Not on purpose. Toddlers are just agents of chaos in tiny shoes.

The woman sighed, hiking her sweatpants back up without missing a beat. The kid‚Äîa girl, maybe two, *definitely* the right size for that onesie‚Äîgiggled and tried to do it again.

That‚Äôs when I saw it. The same cloud pattern. Same pink. Just‚Ä¶ dirtier.

I slid into the booth across from them.

""You lose something?""

The woman blinked at me. ""What?""

I pulled the onesie from my bag.

Her eyes widened. ""*Oh my god.*"" She snatched it, holding it up to the light like she couldn‚Äôt believe it was real. ""Where did you‚Äî""

""Laundromat,"" I said. ""Behind the dryer.""

She pressed it to her face and inhaled deeply. ""*Oh thank god.* I thought I left it at the‚Äî"" She cut herself off, her cheeks flushing.

I raised an eyebrow. ""The casino?""

Her shoulders slumped. ""Yeah.""

The toddler‚Äî*Blossom*, according to the Sharpie scribble on her shirt‚Äîgrabbed at the onesie with sticky fingers. ""*Mine!*""

The woman‚Äî*Helen*, as I‚Äôd soon learn‚Äîsighed. ""Yeah, baby. It‚Äôs yours."" She turned back to me.

Helen had one of those faces that looked like it had been through a divorce, a bankruptcy, and a Vegas buffet all in the same weekend‚Äîwhich, as it turned out, wasn‚Äôt far off.

""You work at the casino?"" I asked.

She snorted. ""I wish. No, I just... lost track of time. And money."" Her fingers tightened around the onesie. ""And my dignity. And possibly my daughter's future college fund.""

Blossom, blissfully unaware of her evaporated tuition, smeared syrup across the table.

I leaned back. ""Let me guess. Roulette?""

""Blackjack,"" she corrected. ""At least until the pit boss caught me counting cards.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""You can count cards?""

She gave me a tired smile. ""Honey, I was a nurse. Counting is what kept people alive."" She glanced at Blossom. ""Until it didn't.""

There was a story there. A bad one. But before I could ask, the waitress dropped off my coffee‚Äîand a fresh strawberry milk for Blossom.

""On the house,"" the waitress muttered, shooting Helen a look that said *I‚Äôve been there*.

Helen's eyes welled up. That's when I knew I was screwed.

I slid a twenty across the table. ""So. Where you staying?""

She hesitated. ""At the moment? The backseat of a '97 Corolla.""

I sipped my coffee. ""I‚Äôve got a couch.""

I lied.

I didn‚Äôt have a couch.

I had a floor.

And a plan.

And a *really* bad feeling about where this was going.

2

Helen insisted on following me back to my place in her Corolla, which was fair‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt know me from a serial killer. What she *didn‚Äôt* know was that I *was* kind of a serial killer.

Not the murderous kind. The *other* kind. The kind that left bodies, sure, but not the kind that left them *dead*.

Just‚Äî

You know what? Never mind.

Point is, I had a floor. And Helen had a kid. And neither of us had money.

Which meant we were exactly the kind of stupid that leads to duct tape in the desert.

My place was a rented room above a pawnshop on East Sahara. The kind of place where the landlord didn‚Äôt ask questions as long as cash appeared under his door every Friday.

Helen parked behind my RV, eyeing the flickering neon sign like it might bite her.

""Why do you need a room if you have an RV?"", she asked.

I shrugged. ""RV needs to be parked somewhere. The room comes with a parking space. And a real bathroom.""

Blossom, half-asleep in her arms, stirred and whined. Helen shushed her, bouncing gently.

I nodded toward the stairs. ""Second door on the left. There‚Äôs a mattress.""

Helen hesitated. ""You‚Äôre not gonna, like... murder us in our sleep, right?""

""If I was going to murder you, I'd do it in the RV. Much easier to dispose of the bodies.""

She stared at me.

I grinned. ""Too soon?""

She exhaled sharply through her nose. ""Just tell me you at least have running water.""

I unlocked the door, stepping aside to let her pass. The stairwell smelled like stale beer and bad decisions, but Helen didn‚Äôt flinch.

Nurses had seen worse.

\---

The morning after was worse than I expected.

Mainly because I woke up to the smell of burning pancakes and a toddler screaming ""*MUDPANCAKES!*"" at the top of her lungs.

I rolled off the floor (see? No couch) and stumbled into the kitchenette to find Helen frantically scraping charcoal off a pan while Blossom, now clad in the infamous pink onesie, danced in place shouting about ""mudpancakes"" like it was the chorus of her personal anthem.

Helen shot me a desperate look. ""She saw a cooking show.""

I blinked. ""And?""

""And now she thinks pancakes are supposed to be *made of mud*.""

Blossom slammed her tiny fist on the counter. ""*MUDPANCAKES!*""

She groaned, leaning against the counter. ""What are we *doing* here, Gary?""

Good question.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

Instead, I grabbed a handful of coffee grounds from the canister and sprinkled them into a fresh pan.

Blossom gasped, eyes wide. ""*Mud!*""

Helen stared. ""What‚Äî""

I cracked an egg over it. ""Compromise.""

Five minutes later, Blossom was shoveling dubious-looking (but technically edible) ""mudpancakes"" into her mouth while Helen nursed a cup of black coffee like it was the last lifeline on a sinking ship.

I leaned against the counter. ""So. What‚Äôs next?""

Helen chewed her lip. ""I don‚Äôt know. Get a job, I guess. Find a place that doesn‚Äôt smell like regret and Axe body spray.""

I snorted. ""Good luck with that in Vegas.""

She shot me a look. ""You got a better idea?""

I did.

It was a *terrible* idea.

Which meant it was *definitely* the next step.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the receipt still tucked there‚Äîthe one that had come with the onesie.

*Zynn Casino.*

Helen paled. ""No.""

I grinned. ""Oh yes.""

Blossom smashed a fistful of coffee-ground pancake onto the table. ""*MUD!*""

Helen groaned. ""We‚Äôre gonna die.""

""Probably,"" I agreed. ""But we might get rich first.""

Blossom threw a pancake at my face.

It was, I decided, a sign.

3

The Zynn Casino smelled like expired perfume and desperation. The kind of place where the carpet stuck to your shoes and the cocktail waitresses had the thousand-yard stare of veterans who'd seen too many bad beats.

Helen adjusted Blossom on her hip, eyeing the blackjack tables like they might bite.

""This is a mistake,"" she muttered.

I shoved my hands in my pockets. ""Probably.""

Blossom, blissfully unaware, was fixated on the flashing lights of a slot machine. ""*Fwuffy!*"" she shrieked, pointing at a neon pink unicorn spinning endlessly on the screen.

Helen exhaled. ""Okay. Quick in-and-out. I play, we win enough for a motel, we leave.""

I raised an eyebrow. ""That the plan?""

""It's *a* plan.""

""It's a *bad* plan.""

She glared at me. ""You got a better one?""

""Yeah."" I nodded toward the high-limit room, where a bored-looking bouncer with arms the size of my thighs stood guard, and a silver-haired woman in a pantsuit that cost more than my RV was disappearing through the doors.

""We skip the middleman.""

Helen blinked. ""What?""

I grinned. ""Meet Bruce.""

\---

Bruce was not, technically speaking, a *good* bouncer.

He was big, sure. Intimidating, absolutely.

But Bruce had one fatal flaw. He was easily distracted.

I watched him for a while while I was casing the place for an unrelated job a few weeks earlier. After a day or two, I established a pattern.

He could *not* stand unmoving in one spot for longer than four and a half minutes.

As the critical time approached, he started fidgeting, glancing at his watch, subtly shifting his weight from foot to foot like a toddler who needed to pee. Until, finally, *something* attracted his attention, and he'd walk away‚Äîjust for a second. Just to look.

\---

""You want me to *what*?"" Helen hissed, clutching Blossom tighter.

""Distract him,"" I repeated, nodding toward Bruce. ""Just long enough for me to get in there.""

She stared at me. ""*How*?""

I glanced at Blossom, then back at Helen. ""Ever seen *Home Alone*?""

... When the timer on my phone read ""4:10"", I gave Helen a discreet nod.

Twenty seconds later, Bruce was sprinting toward the lobby because a *""very concerned mother""* had just reported a *""naked toddler running toward the valet""*‚Äî

(Blossom, fully clothed, was currently hiding under a blackjack table eating a stolen maraschino cherry)

‚Äîand I was slipping into the high-limit room like I belonged there.

Which, for the record, I *didn't*.

But the Zynn Casino didn't know that.

The high-limit room was exactly what you'd expect: plush chairs, thicker carpet, and the kind of quiet that only comes when people are too scared to breathe too loud.

At the far table, Lillian was stacking chips with the precision of a neurosurgeon.

She looked like she could have been Hillary's long lost twin, right down to a pantsuit. I watched her discreetly for a few seconds, hoping that she'd betray herself. I focused on her eyes. The reptilians were supposed to have a third set of eyelids - horizontal ones. But there was nothing. She was either human (doubtful) or very good at controlling her reflexes.

*Lillian.* Hedge fund manager turned Vermont State Senator. Worth somewhere north of $80 million. The famous (or infamous, depending on who you asked) ""swaddler vigilante"". Her face was all over the Interwebs about a year and a half ago - when she was briefly arrested for assaulting a man over in Maplewood, VT.

Well, ""assaulting"" was not *quite* the right word. The man had been - I kid you not - swaddled into a bed sheet, propped in front of a TV, and forced to watch Teletubbies on a loop. For *five* *days*.

Why was she in Vegas and not in prison then, you'd ask. An excellent question.

First of all, it turned out that the man had been beating his stepson. For *years*. Which immediately turned the public opinion 180 degrees.

Second of all, it turned out that she had nothing to do with it anyway - someone planted her DNA on the scene.

Nevertheless, she took this opportunity to cash out from her cushy Wall Street job, make a name for herself as a defender of justice, and pivot into politics.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was better or worse than the alternative.

Finding her here in Vegas was a rare piece of luck. Because I happened to know the guy who actually planted that DNA - we were old army buddies. When I mentioned that Lillian was in Vegas, he forwarded me a certain ... photo. It featured Lillian and a horse.

""Use it wisely"", he'd said.

And oh, I intended to.

I didn't waste any time.

""I want you to pass a message to Sheldon.""

Lillian didn't look up from her chips. ""Who the hell are you?""

""The guy who knows about certain ... horse pics.""

That got her attention. Her fingers stilled.

Slowly, she lifted her head, eyes narrowing. ""You're bluffing.""

""Am I?"" I pulled out my phone and tapped the screen a few times.

Her face went pale. ""What do you want?""

""Like I said. A discreet message to Sheldon.""

""What kind of message?""

I hesitated. ""He's interested in ... unusual merchandise. Stuff that he can't find on eBay. I have the merchandise.""

Lillian's lips thinned into a tight line. She knew exactly what I was implying.

""You're insane,"" she hissed under her breath. ""Sheldon doesn't dabble in *that* kind of merchandise.""

I leaned in slightly, keeping my voice just above a whisper. ""If he's not interested, then he does not need to come, does he?""

Her knuckles whitened around her chips. ""You're playing with fire.""

I smiled. ""That's the only way to make pancakes.""

Blossom chose that moment to barrel into the high-limit room, trailing cherry juice and giggling like a tiny demon. Bruce was right behind her, red-faced and panting.

‚Äú*Mama!*‚Äù Blossom shrieked, launching herself at Helen, who had just appeared in the doorway looking frazzled.

Lillian‚Äôs eyes darted between me, the toddler, and the chaos unfolding. For a split second, I saw something like calculation flicker across her face. Then she schooled her expression back into politician-worthy neutrality.

""Route 95, Shell gas station at exit 99, midnight tonight. Gray RV. Tell him to come alone, and bring lots of cash.""

Lillian's jaw tightened. She didn't like being told what to do, but the horse pics‚Äîyeah, those were leverage no politician could ignore. ""Fine. But if this goes south, I'm denying everything.""

""Wouldn't expect anything less.""

Bruce finally caught up, grabbing Blossom by the back of her onesie like a misbehaving kitten. ""Ma'am, you *can't* bring a child in here‚Äî""

Helen snatched Blossom back. ""She's *two*, not a contraband slot machine.""

Lillian stood abruptly, gathering her chips. ""I‚Äôll deliver your message."" She shot me one last glare. ""But if I *ever* see those photos again‚Äî""

""You won‚Äôt."" I smirked. ""Unless I die mysteriously. Then they go viral.""

Blossom blew a raspberry at Bruce.

Helen sighed. ""We are *so* screwed.""

I clapped her on the shoulder. ""Probably. But at least we‚Äôll be screwed in an RV.""

4

Even at midnight, the desert was *hot*. The kind of heat that clung to your skin like a bad regret.

The Shell station at exit 99 was nearly empty. A clerk who looked like she‚Äôd seen God and He‚Äôd asked for a pack of Marlboros eyed us from behind the counter as we pulled in. A shiny 35' Winnebago Adventurer, the sort that probably ate dead dinosaurs at the rate of one gallon per mile, was being refilled at the far pump.

Inside the convenience store, two kids, a boy and a girl, both aged about 10, were in the midst of a passionate argument about energy drinks. The girl - her name seemed to be Vanessa - was partial to Nitro (which I took to mean Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew), and the boy was arguing for C4.

I listened to their bickering for a few beats, then got a can of C4 *and* a can of Nitro. As I was walking toward the cashier, I heard the boy say ""the whole point is that C4 is *stable*. Nitro will blow if you so much as look at it funny.""

The girl scoffed. ""That's why it needs *skill*.""

I scratched my head, looked at the two cans in my hands, then, just to be safe, put Nitro back in the fridge. I paid, left the convenience store, and leaned against the RV, watching Helen rocking a half-asleep Blossom in the passenger seat.

""You sure this is gonna work?"" she whispered.

""No.""

She groaned. ""That‚Äôs *so* reassuring.""

A pair of headlights cut through the darkness, slowing as they approached.

Showtime.

The car‚Äîa sleek black Mercedes with tinted windows‚Äîpulled up beside us. The door swung open, and out stepped Sheldon.

Second-richest man in Vegas. Owner of three casinos. And, if the rumors were true, a man with *very* specific tastes when it came to collectibles.

He looked around discreetly - checking for undercover cops, no doubt. ""You‚Äôre the ones with the *merchandise*?""

I crossed my arms. ""Depends. You bring the cash?""

He nodded curtly.

Blossom stuck her head out the RV window and blew a raspberry at him.

Sheldon licked his lips. Nervous. Excited. A man who knew he was about to cross a line and couldn't wait to do it.

I smiled at him and went back inside the RV.

He was predictable. Not two minutes later, he was pulling the door of the RV, eager to get a closer look at ... the *merchandise*. By then, I had a good look at his car, making sure that he was alone. No bodyguards, no aides.

Helen hit him on the head with Blossom's doll house. It wasn‚Äôt even heavy enough to knock him out, but it sure as hell startled him.

That‚Äôs when I tased him.

\---

We stripped him naked. Not because we had some weird fetish‚Äîthough, let's be real, this whole situation was *already* weird‚Äîbut because rich guys like Sheldon tend to stash trackers in their clothes. But even we had our limits. Besides, there was a toddler girl present. So, we put a fluffy pink onesie on him instead.

By sunrise, some lucky desert rat would be strutting down the Strip in a $15,000 vicu√±a wool atrocity with jade surveillance-cam buttons and platinum thread delusions of grandeur. But that was a tomorrow problem.

We duct taped him to a folding bed. Then I carefully checked his eyelids.

No horizontal blink.

Damn.

""Not a lizard,"" I muttered.

Helen frowned, adjusting Blossom on her hip. ""What?""

""Nothing.""

I went back to the Mercedes and popped the trunk. Inside was a gray duffel bag.

U.S. dollars are surprisingly light, especially in large denominations. The bag - not even half-full - contained around thirty pounds of bank-wrapped stacks of $100 bills. I quickly counted the stacks. I came up with $1.5 million. I frowned, then took out my phone and used the phone calculator. The answer did not change.

That was a good start.

I briefly wondered what kind of *merchandise* Sheldon was expecting to buy with this kind of cash. Was he expecting that I'd hock him a Mona Lisa? Or was he lugging $1.5M worth of cash in his trunk on general principles? Considering his net worth, that could have been akin to me keeping a $100 in my shoe - just in case.

Either way, I was not about to complain.

I took the bag with me into the RV and jammed it under the driver's seat. Sheldon was starting to stir. Blossom was sitting on his chest and studying him with the kind of concentration only a 2-year-old could muster.

Sheldon blinked groggily. ""Wh-what the hell is this?""

""Mudpancakes!"" Blossom announced, shoving a handful of coffee grounds into his mouth.

Helen winced from the driver's seat. ""Sorry. We told her not to feed strangers.""

Sheldon spat out most of the coffee grounds. ""*What the fuck is happening?!*"" He strained against the duct tape, eyes wild. ""Are you *kidnapping* me?""

""Langwidge"", scolded Blossom, poking him in the nose.

""I prefer to think of it as 'taking you with us on a quick road trip',"" I clarified.

Sheldon made a sound like a tea kettle choking on its own steam.

""And don't worry. We'll keep you entertained."" I tossed a DVD onto his chest. It was *My Little Pony: The Movie*.

Blossom's face lit up. ""*PONIES!*""

Sheldon whimpered.

Blossom patted his cheek with her sticky hand. ""*No cwy.*""

I turned the key in the ignition.

\---

On screen, Twilight Sparkle and friends had just managed to defeat the villainous Storm King for the third time. Sheldon was reclined against the wall of the RV, his eyes half closed. (We untied him after the first time.) He was humming *Friendship is Magic* under his breath. Blossom was sitting in his lap, her eyes fixed on the screen.

Bruce was driving.

*Wait, what?*

Yeah. Bruce.

Turns out, Helen had given him $20 and a sob story about her kid needing a liver transplant, and the big guy had folded like a cheap suit. Now he was behind the wheel, humming along to *Barbie Girl* on the radio.

""Again, again!"" whooped Blossom, bouncing in Sheldon's lap.

Helen, riding shotgun, glanced back at me. ""You sure we're going the right way?""

I checked the GPS. ""Area 51's straight ahead. Just gotta get past the government's 'No Trespassing' signs and the armed patrols.""

Bruce snorted. ""Pfft. Those guys are all talk.""

Sheldon moaned, rubbing his temples. ""I'm gonna be sick.""

Blossom patted his knee. ""No sick! Pony time!"" She jammed the DVD remote, restarting *My Little Pony* for the fourth time.

""Why are we going to Area 51 again?"", Bruce asked.

""Because that's where they keep the alien mothership"", I explained to him. ""And we're going to need it.""

Sheldon groaned. ""*Oh god, you're insane.*""

Blossom clapped her hands excitedly. ""*Spaceship! Spaceship!*""

Helen sighed, rubbing her temples. ""Gary, I need you to explain this plan one more time. Slowly.""

I leaned forward, resting my arms on the back of her seat. ""Okay. Step one‚Äîkidnap a corrupt casino billionaire.""

""Done,"" said Bruce.

""Step two‚Äîdrive him to the middle of nowhere so nobody finds him until we're long gone.""

Helen nodded. ""Also done.""

""Step three‚Äîconvince him to sign over majority shares of his casinos to a shell corporation controlled by us.""

Sheldon made a strangled noise. ""*Never.*""

Blossom shoved another handful of 'mudpancakes' into his mouth. ""*Eat! Eat! GROW BIG AND STRONG!*""

""Step *four*,"" I continued, ""use that wealth to fund the first civilian-led mission to retrieve the alien mothership buried under Area 51‚Äîbecause *obviously* the government won't do it.""

Bruce blinked. ""Wait, that's a real thing?""

""Of *course* it's a real thing,"" I said. ""Why else would the military guard an empty desert?""

Helen stared at me. ""...You *actually* believe in aliens.""

I grinned. ""Helen. *Sweetheart.* Look me in the eye and tell me this planet isn't being run by incompetent lizard people.""

She opened her mouth‚Äîthen closed it.

Blossom gasped, pointing out the window. ""*LIZZYD!*""

We all turned‚Äî

‚Äîjust in time to see a tumbleweed roll across the road.

Bruce burst out laughing. Sheldon groaned like a man who'd just realized his kidnappers were idiots. Helen buried her face in her hands.

And me?

I just smiled, watching the desert fly by.

Because the best cons weren't about money.

They were about belief.

And right now?

They *all* believed.

**EPILOGUE**

Three weeks later

A very dusty RV pulled up in front of Zynn Casino.

A valet - who did not look like he was old enough to legally drive, and had a distinct odor of cannabis about him - stepped forward. ""You can't park here, self-park is around the back"", he started saying, before his eyes focused on the face of the driver.

He turned pale.

""Mr. Sheldon, sir! We... we thought you were dead!""

Sheldon grinned at him. ""I was. Then I got better.""

He stepped out of the RV. He was still wearing the same pink onesie, now covered in what looked like dried strawberry milk and glitter glue. His hair‚Äîusually immaculately styled‚Äîstuck up in wild tufts, as if he'd been electrocuted. (He had.)

The valet gulped. ""Uh. Should I... call someone, sir?""

Sheldon clapped him on the shoulder, leaving a sticky handprint. ""*Son.* Do you believe in aliens?""

The valet blinked. ""I‚Äîwhat?""

Behind Sheldon, the RV door creaked open. Out tumbled Blossom, now sporting a tinfoil hat and dragging a stuffed alien plushie twice her size. ""*PONIES IN SPAAAAACE!*"" she shrieked, sprinting toward the casino doors.

Bruce appeared after her, blinking against the sunlight like a confused bear. He was chewing on a stick of 'alien jerky' (beef jerky with green food coloring). If I'd paid attention just then, I would have noticed something ... unexpected. The way his third eyelid flickered‚Äîjust for a split second‚Äîas he stepped into the Vegas sun.

But I wasn't looking.

Helen brought up the rear, humming the *My Little Pony* theme song under her breath.

I stayed just long enough to watch Sheldon‚Äîbillionaire, casino mogul, and recently converted UFO enthusiast‚Äîchase after a toddler screaming about interdimensional friendship.

Then I double-checked that the duffel bag of cash was still there, slid into the driver's seat, and turned the key.

The desert sun was high. The road was long.

And some poor sap in Reno was about to wake up to a *very* confused horse in his bathtub.

But that?

Just trying to have normal conversations on Holy Scripture or answer questions she has on Orthodoxy. My answers get her so mad. 

She says I make her feel guilty but I didn‚Äôt even imply anything nor was rude, even less did I condemn.

For example she doesn‚Äôt get why in Orthodoxy we fast so much. I simply told her Christ said ‚Äúwhen you fast..‚Äù We‚Äôre expected. 

It‚Äôs sad. My mother has a lot of Roman Catholic imagery around her home, which is actually beautiful in practice and aesthetically. 

I tried to later apologize and tell her I‚Äôm not trying to make her feel bad. I‚Äôm not evangelizing or pushing Orthodoxy on her. I‚Äôm speaking with common ground (New Testament) and that somehow irritates her. I may have to see my mom less, for our souls‚Äô sake

Makes me sad because I don‚Äôt have anyone else in this world. 

My long time friends are lukewarm Protestants that are now armchair theologians without doing much research. I‚Äôve simply shared my convictions and so forth. I have never condemned them.

I‚Äôve tried making friends at my parish but it doesn‚Äôt go that far. 

The people I‚Äôm closer in age are married or engaged. The folks younger than me don‚Äôt really want to be around me like that which is understandable.

Sometimes I wonder why did I have to pray so often daily for growth beyond my Baptist Church to end up being a lonely convert in my local OCA parish. I‚Äôve tried our local GOARCH parish last Sunday. Felt even more out of place during coffee hour.

Praying in the morning, during my lunch hour at work, praying when I get home and before bed is the only thing that keeps me going. Even saw a Christian therapist yesterday.

I just can‚Äôt turn away from the beauty of Divine Liturgy, Vespers and my prayer books. I felt so loved at my Baptist Church, not so much here.

**ADHD Tax Return ‚Äì an unexpected advantage or opportunity presented by the failure to perform -or- the uninhibited impulses brought about by one's symptoms**

We ladies in the US know about the impending supply chain issues. I won't harp on that. However, I find myself in a somewhat unique and perhaps comical advantageous position due to certain... impulses I experienced in the somewhat-recent past.

At the end of last year I went on a coffee kick. Went absolutely bananas buying new flavors, spent an absurd amount of money trying out new brands and new types. Most of it is unopened because I at least committed myself to *not* opening new packages until I had used up all of the previous ones, which means... I have a mountain of coffee. All different kinds. Unopened, packaged safely in a cool dark place. What I don't use myself I can use for gifts. Big W. 

A year ago or so I did the same thing with body wash. Bath & Body Works was having a sale and in a moment of impulsive weakness I convinced myself that I had to get every single scent that looked even the tiniest bit fascinating. I'm embarrassed to admit how much money I spent and just how many bottles of body wash I actually have, but I'm confident that I can ride out the next decade without buying a single new bottle.

... I also did the same thing with foaming hand soap. 

... I also did the same thing with several other household goods & foods that I'm too embarrassed to list out here, but if anyone is looking for the entire country of culinary Japan, it's in my basement.

Finally ‚Äî I have had, for three *years*, a massive pile of things that I intended on donating because I really need to de-clutter my magpie collection of belongings that I've collected over the years (due to various other impulses) and/or inherited from my grandmother's belongings of household items that I didn't need or use. I dragged my feet for YEARS, telling myself ""oh next week I'll donate it / drop it off / etc."" but I never did. Now? I have reclaimed from that pile: entire gallons of bleach, silicone Ziploc bags from my ""I'm gonna use silicone Ziploc bags!"" phase, mis-matched plastic Tupperware, old clothes and linens that are worn but not *ragged*, and dozens of other things that I would have been happy to donate under better circumstances but I've *now* found other uses for. Because I dragged my feet and kept them, and now I have an opportunity to reframe the way I think about these items and whether or not they can be repurposed in lieu of *other* things that I might have otherwise had to buy.

I have paid the ADHD Tax so, *so* many times. Last week I lost an entire 2lbs of beef because I left the container on the floor when grabbing something out of my chest freezer. But it's really nice to get a Tax Return every once in a while.",3,1746231794.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I met Josie at the store one day by my house probably around a year and a half ago. I live in a small town and never really had too many dating options when it comes to girls so whenever I saw a pretty girl I didn‚Äôt recognize from the store. I obviously was gonna see what that was about, so I decided that whatever I saw her I would just compliment her every time and be really nice to her one specific time. I remember I complimented how her hair looked, and when I looked into her very beautiful blue eyes I knew that I wanted to get to know this girl so I contacted one of my friends that worked at the store at the time and I was able to get her Snapchat. I tried to get with her maybe a month after getting her Snapchat didn‚Äôt have much success and they‚Äôll be kind of just stop talking for about a year with a snap streak and we would snap each other every day never really talked one day. I finally decided that I should talk to her and then I did. We really hit it off. We had a lot in common and then eventually we started our talking stage. It was going really good at first. I really enjoyed everything about her. She made me laugh. She was really pretty and she was really nice too one of the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met so we have our talking stage for around a month or a month and a half I would do things like go to our job and get her coffee talk to her about her day. I took her out to a restaurant and we really hit it off then one day she randomly told me that she lost feelings and she didn‚Äôt know why feeling like I wasted my time. I was pretty upset about this. I didn‚Äôt call her out of her name or anything like that, but I was just really upset and that was really what kind of took over how I talk to her after that I was basically just getting upset saying why do you waste my time I feel like I wasted my time whenever you didn‚Äôt really wanna be with me meanwhile we had many personal talk so you know about my ex-girlfriend who cheated on me before so feeling like I wasted my time again, I obviously was really hurt. This is a little bit after Christmas and she already got me new shoes for Christmas without knowing the shoes or anything about that or even caring that it was after Christmas. I told her go give them to charity. I don‚Äôt want them and then proceeded to remove her off Snapchat. I now almost 6 months later and working at the same place that she worked at and she‚Äôs a supervisor now I feel really bad because I feel like it was my fault to an extent but at the same time I still feel like maybe I was in the right feeling how I felt.

Basically my crush and I had chemistry some years ago in high school when we met in class, got along really well, shared the same sense of humor, but we happened to be seeing other people, then life gets in the way as it does.

He dated *literally* the most beautiful girl in our town, like she is objectively insanely gorgeous and she was more his type/ran in the same circles, same hobbies, etc.

A few nights ago, I posted something on social media and he randomly replied to it and out of the blue said he'd be very up for going out for coffee together. He and I hadn't spoken in 4 years. Not even a hello, how are you.

It caught me super off guard that he would be very up for going on a date out of nowhere and that he would ask me in the first place.

I'm not ugly or awkward and enough guys have asked me out before, but I'm like the total opposite of the girl he dated before: she was thick and curvy and I'm kind of curvy but more willowy and lean. She was a ""bad bitch"" and partied and I was never invited to parties, was goofy, and had my own interests.

I thought I was a pretty confident person but with him, I feel like what the hell did he ask *me* out for? Or is this just an on-a-whim thing and he just wants to get *someone?*

Basically, how can I hide that I'm not feeling confident and feeling totally baffled? What can I do to seem confident when I feel completely confused?",0,1746231615.0,AskMenAdvice,16,0.5,False
1kdg1mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1kdg1mi/how_i_make_money_with_instagram_theme_pages_3000/,"How I make money with Instagram theme pages ($3,000+ last month)","I started a theme page a little over a year ago and I'm still doing it.

In the past month, I launched 4 more.

Here's what it is, how it works and how it makes money.

This is one of many ways to monetize a social media page. Here's a look into my journey so far...

**What are theme pages?**

Theme pages are social media pages curated around a particular topic.

I've seen them on topics like:

* Dogs
* Motivational quotes
* Memes
* Plus size models
* Gardening
* Food and recipes

You can create it around any topic or interest, really.

**How do you make money with theme pages?**

There are a bunch of ways how you can monetize it.

I created mine around the entrepreneurship and business niche. I created short 4-5 second reels to encourage and inspire my audience to start a business.

This was monetized with digital products.

So viewers would see my reels and stories, visit my store in my bio and buy digital products to help them start and/or grow a business.

**Other kinds of monetization:**

* **Creator-based programs or bonus programs** (like the Meta Breakthrough Bonus or Snapchat Spotlight)
* **Selling services** \- like offering coaching, consulting, auditing, etc.
* **Selling physical goods** like t-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, jewelry, etc.
* **Affiliate marketing** \- linking your affiliate link in your bio and earning commissions when viewers click your affiliate link and buy

**How did I make money with my theme page?**

Digital products.

I have a Beacons store. I have a mix of various digital products - some I have made, some are pre-made products that I can resell.

**How fast did I start making money?**

Within the first 2 days.

To be transparent, I was not a beginner. I had experience posting on social media and running a business with social media so creating and posting content, growing a social page, etc. was not new to me.

But, this is beginner-friendly.

A peer of mine was brand new to this and built a similar theme page to mine on Instagram for about 2X the followers as me in less time and made more money than me.

She grew to 16K followers and up to $30K/month.

**What's the catch?**

This is not easy.

It's a simple concept: pick a topic you like, post on Instagram about it, pick one or more ways to monetize and watch the money come in.

But, too many people quit early because they are impatient.

It can take time to build a following and start making money. When you make your first money is not guaranteed. It could be 3 days into it or 3 weeks into it or longer.

**What about my other theme pages?**

Because of the success of this first theme page I launched last year, I've created 4 more in the past month:

* 2 Facebook pages
* 1 Threads page
* 1 Instagram page

Three of the four pages each have under 30 followers, less than a week into it and have made no money.

One page has 105 followers and has made just under $500 in the first month.

**Long term plans**

I would like to get to a point where I'm operating a few of these few pages for full-time income each. Not just one, but at least 3 where they draw a full-time income each.

I consider this a low-effort, potentially very lucrative way to do it.

This isn't a new thing but, it's new to me.

**Aidaros here.** I'm 18, and I am just wrapping up my first year of studying computer science. And honestly, it‚Äôs been intense.

Like probably many of you, I tried using a bunch of new AI tools that were hyped up for studying smarter. I tested tons of them, hoping they‚Äôd help me make sense of dense PDFs, lecture recordings, YouTube tutorials, and endless pages of notes.

But honestly? I kept getting disappointed. Something always felt missing. Most tools just gave shallow summaries that didn‚Äôt really help me understand the core concepts, connect ideas, or organize the material in a way that stuck for exams. It felt surface-level, not real learning. I needed something that actually reflected how we learn best, using techniques that actually work.

So about 50 days ago, out of pure frustration (and necessity), I decided to just build it myself. What started as a small idea turned into an intense coding journey. I poured my heart, soul, and way too much coffee into it.

The result is **StudySmarterAI.**

My entire goal was to build the tool I wished existed. One that could take all that messy study material and turn it into something organized, deep, and truly helpful for learning.

# Instead of just summaries, it does things like:

# üîç Deep Automatic Notes

It breaks your material into logical **Chapters**, then breaks each chapter down into key **Concepts**. For each concept, you get:

* A proper **Definition**
* A detailed **Breakdown**
* **Common Misconceptions** (super helpful!)
* **Critical Details**
* **Practical Examples** (especially for code/math ‚Äî all formatted properly)

Everything is **color-coded and visually structured** for easier review.

# üí¨ Contextual AI Assistant

Each chapter has its own chatbot that understands that **specific chapter's content**. So when you ask it questions, the answers are relevant, not random.

# üß† Built-In Tools Based on Learning Science

This was a big deal for me. I didn‚Äôt just want features. I wanted **tools that actually help you learn**:

* **Smarty Tutor** ‚Äì Pick any concept and get a personalized, interactive mini-lesson, complete with analogies and a quick quiz to check your understanding.
* **Smart Flashcards & Quizzes** ‚Äì Auto-generate flashcards and quizzes for each chapter. Choose difficulty levels (**Easy/Medium/Hard**) and get detailed feedback on every answer.
* **Teach Smartee (Feynman Technique)** ‚Äì The AI pretends to be confused, and you teach it the concept. Amazing for reinforcing understanding.
* **Brain Dump (Blurting Method)** ‚Äì Recall everything you know about a chapter, and the AI gives feedback on what you nailed and what you missed.
* **Think Deeper (Elaboration)** ‚Äì The AI asks ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù questions to push your thinking beyond memorization.

It‚Äôs all **interactive** and designed to move you beyond passive reading.

There‚Äôs also a built-in **Pomodoro timer** and a bit of **gamification** (XP, levels, streaks) to help keep you motivated.

I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful for your honest feedback. I genuinely want this to be useful for other students dealing with the same struggles I had.

I am in my mid/late 20s, 5‚Äô6 and last weight at 270.
I gained this weight very quickly in the last 4 years I gained 100s and have maintained it since (gained it about 3 years ago, maintained it since) 
I have limited mobility until I can get a breast reduction, due to pinched nerves and back pain I‚Äôm constantly under. I worked an office job, and now telework for that same job. I sit for about 12 hours a day.  I tried to use a stepper for under my desk but haven‚Äôt been able to get in a groove with it.

For backstory, I have tried many diets, calorie counting, and intermittent fasting. However calorie counting lead to obsessing which lead to a binge eating disorder. I have terrible self discipline. I have autism, and bipolar disorder, so on any swings I just want pasta all the time. I get fast food about 3 times a month, and I drink soda even less that that, and don‚Äôt drink juice. I drink coffee every morning, but just coffee and creamer, no added syrup or sugar. I usually eat around 10, 2, and 7. Sometimes a little snack before 7. 

I have 2 kids, and miss having energy for them, and confidence to go to all their events in front of other parents that I used to have before this weight gain.

I have had blood tests, and a thyroid biopsy, all have been good aside from my cholesterol levels. 

But I just need any tips on things I could change that could even be small so I could make myself build up to any habits, and any tips on things you guys do that I could try to start working on weight the mobility issue I have. My goal is to get back to 160, (maybe 135 would be ideal, but I felt the most confident at 160). I need to lose it before I can get a reduction that would really help with mobility.

I am low-income, and work a lot so aside from my last appointments I‚Äôm not able to see anyone about it so I‚Äôve been trying to figure most of this out in my own. ",1,1746230452.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

I thought that was financial discipline.

But here‚Äôs the truth: being overly frugal kept me in a scarcity mindset. I was always stressed, always feeling like I didn‚Äôt have enough, even when I had savings. And weirdly, I‚Äôd still have random ‚Äúsplurge moments‚Äù because I felt so restricted.

What actually helped me get control of my money wasn‚Äôt just budgeting ‚Äî it was these 3 things:

1. I tracked my cash flow, not just my expenses.
Knowing how much I had left after all fixed costs and savings (pay yourself first!) gave me freedom to intentionally enjoy some of it, without guilt.

2. I stopped trying to save every dollar and focused on earning more.
I upskilled, negotiated salary, and did small side gigs. Just one raise changed my financial margin more than a year of cutting expenses ever did.

3. I gave my money a purpose.
Once I had clear short- and long-term goals (emergency fund, travel fund, investing), saving became exciting ‚Äî not restrictive.

I still live below my means. But it doesn‚Äôt feel like a punishment anymore. It feels intentional.

Curious: what shift helped you get real control over your money?",22,1746230449.0,personalfinance,10,0.96,False

1kdfmmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kdfmmb/the_kiosk_entry_no_2/,The Kiosk - Entry No. 2,"[Entry No. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kb2ey5/the_kiosk/)

Today's shift began pretty easily. I mean it is a national holiday and everyone is out in less depressing parts of the city or at home. I of course am at work, as always.

Sitting at the desk with my laptop and power-saving mode on ‚Äì writing this. Once the battery goes out I'll probably tinker with the radio. The thing has been stuck on one damn station for the entire duration that I've worked here. And its always the same rock, blues and occasional folk song over and over again with the host commenting on the local politics sometimes.

I really need something new to listen to...

But since there are no customers yet, I'll write a couple more things about the regulars.

Well... Last time I *did* mention the *hallway*. I should elaborate more on it before I go on my tangent.

As of writing the hallway has become a staple feature of the kiosk. There are no lights in there, so I have to have a flashlight with me whenever I go in there.

I never go far in. I find the shelf that has what I need and I come back, which is usually a couple steps in. And what I need is either vodka, beer or tobacco... Which is conveniently most of the damn hallway from what I can see.

I do hear shuffling when inside that place, too. Ever since the hallway appeared the little bastards aren't as active as before. I think they have all the vodka they need in the hallway. Though it still does happen that a vodka bottle drops down and breaks here and there... At least Winston doesn't cut my pay because of it... We do have an infinite supply of the stuff now anyway.

Oh, yeah. The shelves restock themselves in the hallway. Don't ask how or why. They just do. *Awfully* convenient.

The flashlight doesn't go that far inside, I can maybe see 10-ish meters inside, before it becomes pitch black. Though when I whistle inside there is an echo that lasts... *Uncomfortably long.*

The roosters though, they became a bit more active in the last few weeks I noticed. They would bang on the door more frequently. I mean the door is made out of metal, and is quite secure. There is one small detail I forgot to mention the last time. The door does have a few... Bumps that seem to have been made by someone ‚Äì or *something* ‚Äì from the outside.

If Winston didn't mention it, I guess it's fine. Could've been the roosters or something.

The whole place is pretty secure to be honest. I just hate that I have no real windows in here, only the little window that fits money, teeth, cigarettes and at most eight bottles of vodka through it ‚Äì horizontally, top first. The rest of the windows are covered by newspapers, and Winston told me not to touch them.

I do find it annoying. But it does help with the anxiety when I hear the banging from the outside, or some other weird sounds sometimes. All I need to see are the customers.

Miss Six tends to try and squint through the newspapers I noticed. She'd knock and I would feel something *stare* at me. I think I once saw one of her eyes through a small slit in the newspapers. Just looking at me.

I forgive her creepiness. It could be that she is impatient to get her sixes ‚Äì vampiric moonshine ‚Äì or some shit.

...

She did offer me that hug? Or did she? Maybe I hallucinated, who knows. I'll ask her later if she comes around... Did I talk to her before? Like *actually* talk?

Agh, there's a first time for everything. Not like women scare me.

I mean I was once greeted by one big eye when I opened that window, it covered the whole view. I couldn‚Äôt see anything beyond it. Just one big, yellowish eye ‚Äì staring at me.

I didn‚Äôt piss myself at all. I probably did shit myself a bit. But that was probably due to the kebab I bought before that shift.

And before you ask ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you go to the toilet?‚Äù ‚Äì I already told you, I refuse to touch that toilet.

I can probably get some balls and venture further into the hall and make an improvised toilet in there‚Ä¶ If Winston asks, I‚Äôll blame the gnomes. Fuck them.

Huh, this journaling shit does help my thinking.

Well, I think there‚Äôs a customer. I‚Äôll write a bit later.

\###

I had a weird thing happen. Someone knocked like ten minutes ago, I opened up and did my greetings. Just to realize no one was there.

Then again a few minutes later, the same thing. Out of all the shit I‚Äôve seen, the most mundane knock and fuck off prank is *weird* to me.

I‚Äôll try to see who it is.

\###¬†

1^(st) May, 23:53hrs

I think I should put the time and date when I write.

I use ‚Äúmilitary time‚Äù. So if any of you Americans think that‚Äôs wrong. I am European. Fuck you.

\###¬†

1^(st) May, 23:58hrs

I forgot what I wanted to write. I apologize to the Americans, I was joking.

Anyway, Miss Six came around today, a little while ago ‚Äì She was in a good mood as always, very polite, a bit flirty. And I decided to ask her something. Not her name, but how someone was knocking then bugging off by the time I opened.

Weirdly she got a bit more serious after that.

‚ÄúAh, *they* like to do that. Don‚Äôt worry about that darling, you can always go out and chase them off. I think a strong man is hiding behind that glass.‚Äù ‚Äì She said, with a wink.

Who is that *they,* I have no idea and why she is constantly trying to get me to go out, I dunno. I only know that I have less of bottle number six and more teeth in the drawers.

\###

2^(nd) May, 00:22

I think Miss Six is trying to ask me out. I mean, ‚ÄúGo out and chase them off‚Äù ‚Äì Could that be some sort of hint? Or am I overthinking it? I think this journaling shit is really helping my thoughts but I am thinking a bit too much for my taste. I don‚Äôt want to spiral again.

The last drunk of the evening got his daily evening dose of vodka and tobacco so I‚Äôll be free for some time again, I think. Glad that I don‚Äôt have to clean the outside, I think he threw up right in front of the kiosk the moment I closed the window.

Anyway, I also wanted to talk more about the shit I saw.

There was this drunk once, not Smirnoff, but a dude that was his age. They seemed similar, like they came from the same dump ‚Äì or swam in stale milk, because he smelled like a combination of a mold, shit, alcohol and milk‚Ä¶ With a hint of lavender.

But he didn‚Äôt smell like that always, the first few months I worked here he just smelled like moldy shit and alcohol ‚Äì and acted like your typical drunk. But I remember one night, he was buying the usual when he told me how ‚Äì through slurred speech ‚Äì ‚ÄúTonight is a wee bit colder, innit brah?‚Äù

I agreed. Despite not really noticing it. He was a bit more anxious for some reason. Like the cops are on to him or something.

He had a gray beanie on his head. It looked like it had seen better days, but it had this specific tear on one side of it. Not deep, but it looked like it had been cut by a knife or something.

See, later that night I heard the usual banging and knocking. But there was a really strong BANG in the front of the kiosk ‚Äì like something went full speed into it. Enough to make me jump from my seat.

I stood frozen for a few moments, before I decided to go and open of the window to see what‚Äôs up. I saw nothing. Then went back to watch Family Guy on my laptop.

Though when my shift ended I took a better look at the front of the kiosk in the morning. And I saw some red‚Ä¶ It looks distinct on the snow, mixed with bile, mud and God knows what else.

And on top of the snow was the gray beanie, with that cut on one side.

I didn‚Äôt touch it, I just looked, and left. I figured the dude probably wanted to get another vodka but was so drunk that he fell, knocked himself out on the kiosk, and I couldn‚Äôt see him on the ground when I opened the window.

I mean if he wasn‚Äôt there he got up at some point, so he was alive.

And I did see him the next evening, but he was‚Ä¶ Off.

He bought the usual. But he didn‚Äôt talk much, or at all. He‚Äôd just come to the kiosk, knock, have the exact amount for a vodka and ciggies in his hand ‚Äì and he‚Äôd just stare.

After a few weeks he was gone completely. The beanie was gone too.

\###¬†

2^(nd) May, 1:02

No customers, don‚Äôt know what to watch. I could maybe get a subscription service for shows and movies‚Ä¶ Maybe? I mean, yeah I can afford it.

Yeah, I can.

I did get that USB with a bunch of newer movies from my cousin‚Ä¶ I left it at home though.

\###¬†

2^(nd) May, 1:20

I had a customer who was new. I think he‚Äôs a bloodsucker. I mean, I know. He wanted number 11. But he also wanted cigarettes and a couple of strawberry juices‚Ä¶ I had to go to the hallway to get some, because Winston didn‚Äôt restock the juices since last month, only kids buy them. Not a lot of kids around here‚Ä¶ Kids that don‚Äôt drink alcohol, that is.

He was like most of them. But he did seem to kind of stare at me more than usual. For some reason.¬†

2^(nd) May, 2:13

I found something to watch, but my battery is low for fuck sake. I should save it.

I could ask Winston why for the love of God and all that is holy this kiosk doesn‚Äôt have one extra power thingy, whatever you call it in English. Plug?

I‚Äôll tell him that my job satisfaction will go through the roof if he does that. Or just somehow lets me able to charge my laptop and phone.¬†

2^(nd) May, 2:44

About 3 hours and 20 minutes left. No customers in the last hour. I‚Äôve been listening to the radio a bit. I tried to switch the station but to no avail.

The radio is on one of the shelves, an old piece of shit. I think its one of those crystal radios, it looks like it was working non-stop since the coronation of Franz Ferdinand‚Ä¶ Wait, he was killed, yeah. Joseph? Yeah, Joseph Ferdinand. I think.

Anyway, I decided to unplug it. Weirdly it worked even when not plugged in‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs when I realized that I have a free plug! But okay, it might have a battery. Weird thing is it started being a bit distorted closer to the desk.

I walked in circles a bit to see where the source of that disruption was, and I think its coming from the hallway.

I took like two steps inside with the radio and confirmed that it was indeed the hallway.

Well, I am not surprised‚Ä¶ Hmm, I might catch some otherworldly radio station? Maybe Smirnoff will be the commentator, the gnomes the audience.

‚ÄúAll About Vodka FM‚Äù ‚Äì It would be called.

My laptop is now charging, the radio is still playing some annoying blues. It at least fills the dullness of the space.¬†

\###

2^(nd) May, 3:00

The banging stopped.

I mean the constant banging that slowly intensifies until around 4:30, it stopped abruptly.

I can just hear the radio now.

Weird.

I am trying to remember if it happened before? I‚Äôll ask Winston about it.

\###¬†

2^(nd) May, 3:10

I‚Äôm sitting here in front of the hallway. Just watching. For some reason curiosity is beginning to creep in.

What‚Äôs beyond all of that? Are the shelves infinite? Why do they restock?

Are the little vodka thiefs to blame for it? Is it the portal to their realm? Or just a colony?

And I think I noticed the shelves are in a *slightly* different arrangement every single time. Like when I go inside ‚Äì let‚Äôs say three times per shift ‚Äì I notice that the vodka shelf is maybe one step farther or one step closer‚Ä¶ Nothing you‚Äôd really notice the first few times. But with me working virtually every single damn evening for the past few months. You start to notice things. Even if they might subconcious‚Ä¶

Or I might imagining things. It can always be that.

Oh, I have customer. I‚Äôll write later.

¬†\###¬†

2^(nd) May, 6:32

I think that I will fucking kill her.

I said women don‚Äôt scare me. But one woman I really, *really* did not want to see. The one whose presence made my stomach drop ‚Äì the one waiting for me behind that creaky, shitty window‚Ä¶

My sister.

I first thought I was hallucinating. But no it was really her.

After confirming that was really her ‚Äì By asking a very specific thing about me ‚Äì then I told her bluntly ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you doing here at this hour?!‚Äù

I swear to God no fucking energy drink or coffee can wake a man up as fast as this. Fucking hell.

‚ÄúI need some help.‚Äù ‚Äì She said.

And of course I was scared to hear what it was.

It ended up being that her friend lives around here and she was sleeping over after a study session. And she needed somewhere to sleep until the buses start driving again around 4 or 4:30.

Firstly, *bullshit.* I know she is a top student and all, but she is a *teenage girl,* and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if her *friend* was of the opposite gender\*.\* Secondly, I was inclined to scold her then and there.

But then I heard some knocks at the back of the kiosk.

Then ‚Äì what if it wasn‚Äôt really *her.*

I heard the knocks go up the kiosk, tapping their way up.

What if I let her in and she end up being a rooster‚Ä¶ And bloodsucker‚Ä¶ Or, who knows what? A shapeshifter?

*She‚Äôll see the damn hallway.*

I heard as the taps reached the roof.

‚ÄúDude why are you staring at me?‚Äù ‚Äì She asked. ‚Äì ‚ÄúIt smells like shit out here!‚Äù

I heard the taps get closer.

‚ÄúGet in. Now.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the door on this thing?‚Äù She asked back.

I got up from my seat and was going to the metal door.

Then I heard her.

I heard her scream.

I bolted, I turned the key in the metal door.

¬†¬†I flung it open and sprinted out. For the first time.

My heart was beating like cannons.

I turned the corner. I was ready to kill.

To die‚Ä¶

But she‚Ä¶ She was fine.

She laughed.

And she was not alone.

‚ÄúGood morning darling! You have a wonderful sister, I must say! My, and he‚Äôs a handsome one isn‚Äôt he Natalia?‚Äù

I stood there, confused. I didn‚Äôt know what to say.

‚ÄúBro, since when did you get a girlfriend? Why didn‚Äôt you tell me!‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what?‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, Kristi, here.‚Äù She pointed at the gorgeous redhead.

‚ÄúNatali, dear, don‚Äôt make him uncomfortable.‚Äù She said to my sister ‚Äì ‚ÄúLook, darling, I brought you something.‚Äù She put forth her hand, holding a plastic bag. I just stared at it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll pas-‚Äú ‚Äì Before I could finish my sentence my sister cut me off ‚Äì ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll take it, thank you!‚Äù

She grabbed the plastic bag. Then gave a the stink eye for a second.

‚ÄúThank you Kristi so much, you‚Äôre a very good teacher! And please do take care of my brother, he‚Äôs a thickheaded idiot as I told you.‚Äù My sister said.

I don‚Äôt remember much of the girl talk. I was stuck frozen in fight or flight mode for I don‚Äôt know how much.

I was jolted out by what *Miss Six* said.

‚ÄúOh, dear. Leave the man be, I‚Äôll drive you home. It‚Äôs no problem. I am a night owl, and I do enjoy a night drive!‚Äù

I was about to say something.

But I somehow felt‚Ä¶ She was not a threat.

‚ÄúCan I drive her back home, or do you want her to be with you?‚Äù She asked ‚Äì *like she read my mind.*

My sister naturally protested how I don‚Äôt order her around.

‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶ Yeah, go ahead. Drive safe.‚Äù I turned to my sister ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou and I have to talk tomorrow.‚Äù

I am writing this from home. I am tired.

I returned back to the kiosk after that. I just sat down in thought. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I felt dreadful yet somehow‚Ä¶ Safe.

Was it a rooster? I asked my sis after coming back home why she screamed when I was heading out, she said *Kristiana* just appeared out of nowhere. And that *she was at her place.*

She ‚Äì Miss Six ‚Äì Is my sister‚Äôs tutor.

And apparently I am her boyfriend. Or maybe that a joke between the two. I don‚Äôt fucking know.

I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that if she didn‚Äôt appear that the scream I would‚Äôve heard from my sister wouldn‚Äôt have been from being startled but out of pain.

That tapping.

That was a rooster. No doubt about it.

I can‚Äôt think. I‚Äôll post this now and just go to sleep. I‚Äôll update you how it goes.

Good night.

But honestly? I kept getting disappointed. Something always felt missing. Most tools just gave shallow summaries that didn‚Äôt really help me understand the core concepts, connect ideas, or organize the material in a way that stuck for exams. It felt surface-level, not real learning. I needed something that actually reflected how we learn best, using techniques that actually work.

So about 50 days ago, out of pure frustration (and necessity), I decided to just build it myself. What started as a small idea turned into an intense coding journey. I poured my heart, soul, and way too much coffee into it.

The result is¬†**StudySmarterAI.**

My entire goal was to build the tool I wished existed. One that could take all that messy study material and turn it into something organized, deep, and truly helpful for learning.

# Instead of just summaries, it does things like:

# üîç Deep Automatic Notes

It breaks your material into logical¬†**Chapters**, then breaks each chapter down into key¬†**Concepts**. For each concept, you get:

* A proper¬†**Definition**
* A detailed¬†**Breakdown**
* **Common Misconceptions**¬†(super helpful!)
* **Critical Details**
* **Practical Examples**¬†(especially for code/math ‚Äî all formatted properly)

Everything is¬†**color-coded and visually structured**¬†for easier review.

# üí¨ Contextual AI Assistant

Each chapter has its own chatbot that understands that¬†**specific chapter's content**. So when you ask it questions, the answers are relevant, not random.

# üß† Built-In Tools Based on Learning Science

This was a big deal for me. I didn‚Äôt just want features. I wanted¬†**tools that actually help you learn**:

* **Smarty Tutor**¬†‚Äì Pick any concept and get a personalized, interactive mini-lesson, complete with analogies and a quick quiz to check your understanding.
* **Smart Flashcards & Quizzes**¬†‚Äì Auto-generate flashcards and quizzes for each chapter. Choose difficulty levels (**Easy/Medium/Hard**) and get detailed feedback on every answer.
* **Teach Smartee (Feynman Technique)**¬†‚Äì The AI pretends to be confused, and you teach it the concept. Amazing for reinforcing understanding.
* **Brain Dump (Blurting Method)**¬†‚Äì Recall everything you know about a chapter, and the AI gives feedback on what you nailed and what you missed.
* **Think Deeper (Elaboration)**¬†‚Äì The AI asks ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù questions to push your thinking beyond memorization.

It‚Äôs all¬†**interactive**¬†and designed to move you beyond passive reading.

There‚Äôs also a built-in¬†**Pomodoro timer**¬†and a bit of¬†**gamification**¬†(XP, levels, streaks) to help keep you motivated.

I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful for your honest feedback. I genuinely want this to be useful for other students dealing with the same struggles I had.

I'm looking for an animation show that I used to watch in my childhood. I used to watch it alongside with Larva on Netflix around 2016-2017. I used to watch on my father's account which was in Egypt if that matters in case it comes to regional availability.

It was a a bunch of animals working and administering afair a coffee shop. There was a bear character I think. And they used to making coffee using french press. I remember it was so cute looking. Not sure but it was probably 3D animated series.

I'm a called worker in a small church, It's me and the pastor and currently neither of us are paid. I'm blessed to be able to self support. I don't think my relationship with the pastor is typical, we have a friendship that preexists the church and he has quite an unusual way of working, which I have just accepted. Another twist is that I've been out of the workforce for a few different reasons, so I'm quite mixed when it comes skills in one area vs. another. Things like being a good colleague, organisation and efficiency aren't great. I'm a fast learner intellectually, but I'm less good at applying it practically. I ask too many questions, I want to get stuff right and I'm often unclear on my freedom to make changes or take action.

In some way these things are just frills, it's me saying I know I have faults. My biggest difficulty is that I'm always ""on"". There is no coffee with a friend, I always represent the church. I'm giving out without filling my tank and I don't know where I'm supposed to fill my tank. The pastor is aware of this, but the solutions are going to be long term, not next week or next month.

Me and him clearly have some practical things to fix, but does anyone have any thoughts about the rest of it? If I say to him I find something hard, he often says it's the nature of ministry, but it's something he chose and got training for, whereas I kind of landed in it by accident.

My mom (45F) retired 3-4 years ago after working her whole life. She was always a happy person, but after her dad passed in 2010, she‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ off. I didn‚Äôt notice much before since she was at work most of the day and only home a few hours. My dad still works, so money isn‚Äôt an issue. Retirement hit her hard she found it boring and tried applying for jobs again here in the UAE. But no one hired her, either because they thought she was ‚Äútoo old,‚Äù overqualified, or the pay was insultingly low. She started spending all her time on YouTube watching boutique clothing videos and Instagram live sellers. Eventually, she decided to start her own online boutique remotely.She hired our cousin back home to handle packing and quality checks, while she picked designs, managed logistics, and built an Instagram page for the business. It‚Äôs been a success, which is amazing, but it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs become a different person.She‚Äôs literally addicted to her phone,Even if we go out which is rare on its own she‚Äôll ask for hotspot so she can go on Instagram again. She‚Äôs basically a hobbit now‚Äîbarely brushes her teeth, rarely bathes, and her hair is clumped up. She‚Äôs always sad, whining, or complaining. I didn‚Äôt notice how bad it was until my sister yelled at her to brush her hair. But when we go out,she‚Äôs all prim and proper and will do everything and no one would suspect anything. She calls herself an ‚Äúold woman‚Äù at 45 and won‚Äôt listen when I tell her to cut down on coffee (it‚Äôs stained her teeth yellow). We don‚Äôt have much family here, so no one visits often, which I usually like since I‚Äôm an introvert. Things changed when I got a poodle. My mom was thrilled and treats him like a human child, which I get since I love him like that too. But when I went on a 2-month vacation (I live with my parents), she took over caring for him. Now she refuses to walk him, says I‚Äôm ‚Äútroubling‚Äù him by taking him out, and feeds him human food like sausages and omelets instead of the kibble I used. He won‚Äôt touch kibble anymore. She even gets upset when I brush his hair, acting like I‚Äôm traumatizing him. Worst of all, he used to sleep with me, but now she insists he sleeps with her, saying she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt sleep without him.‚Äù She gets so emotional that I give in to avoid conflict. My parents have been in an unhappy marriage forever, sleeping in separate rooms for as long as I can remember. They‚Äôre Indian, and I think the stigma of divorce keeps them together despite their mutual dislike. My mom vents about my dad to me (has since I was a toddler), but he at least doesn‚Äôt badmouth her to me. They‚Äôre both passive-aggressive and openly show their resentment. My mom also over-criticizes herself like she‚Äôll serve food to guests and say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as good as your biryani, I can‚Äôt cook,‚Äù before they even taste it. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs a teenager sometimes. The other day, I found depression pills in the pantry. My mom‚Äôs memory is awful‚Äîshe‚Äôll forget eating noodles and 2 mins later ask who ate the noodles  she even skips her anemia meds (she gives them to me instead, even though my iron levels are not as bad as hers ). And then when you correct her she‚Äôll laugh and be like ah I forgot like it‚Äôs a funny thing and sometimes when you call her out on her forgetting stuff she‚Äôll say  ah I forgot like its something to be proud of.When I asked about the depression pills, she said she didn‚Äôt know whose they were. I later realized they‚Äôre hers, unopened. I asked her to go to the doctor for her memory and she says she‚Äôs been there and doctor said it‚Äôs just because of stress .She also has extremely low vitamin d and won‚Äôt take meds. I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs depressed and not taking care of herself, but I don‚Äôt know how to approach this.

Aug.8: Merida ‚Äì City discovery, Chill day

Aug.9: Merida - Progresso or Uxmal tour or just Merida-Plaza Grande night

Aug.10: Merida - Mercado municipal (lunch), Merida --> Valladolid

Aug.11: Valladolid ‚Äì Cenote (Hacienda Cenote Oxman)

Aug.12: Valladolid - Chechen Itza (via tour or collectivo)

\- PDC: Ojo de agua, Botica bistro

\- MERIDA¬†: Dulceria Colon, Chaya Maya, Taqueria la lupita, Museul de gastronomy, Chilakilez, NOL, El trapiche, Wayan‚Äôe, Manajar Blanco

\- VALLADOLID: Yebrabuena del Sisal, El tigrillo, Meson del marques, Casa de los Venados, IX Cat IK

\- ISLA MUJERES¬†: Buho, Rooster, Abuelos

\- Private transport from Holb to CAN, taxi to port, ferry to Isla Mujeres

\- Uber or Taxis in PdC, Merida, Valladolid when needed.

\- Booking on the spot at cozumel at the ferry terminal

\- book online 1-2 days in advance via vialtor etc.

I quickly opened my checking account and noticed my wells fargo credit card withdrew $10,000. I immediately called them and told them the situation and got it handled. However, after that spook I started using Experian again and even got their $25 membership. After reviewing my information I noticed my credit card balance was $44,000. Turns out those citibank cards were somehow activated and someone maxed them out. I immediately called citibank, 911, and Experian. Citibank said they closed my previous inquiry for some reason and I asked why, the lady said the cards were sent to my house, however I did not activate them. 911 told me to call their fraud service department but its too late and its closed. Experian told me to keep my credit file locked and wait for an answer from both them and the government. Is there anything else I can do yall I am freaking out.

1kdexgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1kdexgk/husband_and_in_laws_have_unrealistic_expectations/,Husband and in laws have unrealistic expectations,"As salam u alaikum everyone!

I'm in need of advice. I got married a few months ago. Me and my husband live separately from in laws, about a 15-30 min drive depending on traffic. I am thankful that we live separately. I do my best to keep the home tidy, make food, and look after my husbands needs.

My mother in law is quite needy and wishes that I call her almost every day. Thing is with in office work, wfh days, housework, and cooking - I don't get much time to make a phone call. Also I've noticed any time I call her or she calls me, she often makes some snide or rude comment that leaves the conversation sour.

My husband made a plan to host his family for this weekend and told me to call his mom to confirm the plan, about two days ago. I forgot to call his mom and today I finally called her. She was extremely rude and basically showed her true self. Often in front of others, she acts very nice and kind but I saw her true self. She said how dare you not call me, what are you good for, what's the point of having you as a daughter in law, you don't show me any respect, etc. She acts as if she did my a great favour by letting me marry her son ""eyeroll""

She then started talking about how I'm a bad host and don't invite her and that it's always her son inviting them. The way I see it is that is his family, he should be the one to invite them.

She also got mad that I was away at my parents place on the day my husbands sister and husband were coming over. I came half an hour before they came and the home was already tidy. I would have come earlier but there was heavy traffic. I had to attend a baby shower in my state so that's why I had to stay at my parents place. Also the plan was already set that we would get food from outside. Mother in law also complained that her daughter made her own tea. Please note that his sister always makes her tea her own way, I had asked her if I can make it and she said no.

Also, yesterday my husband came home and said all these things to me as well, like exact words so it definitely means that his mom told him to say these things to me.


In addition, then my husband started listing all the negatives of me such as how I don't fold his laundry, dont take out the garbage, about how I'm a bad host, and about how I am treating him as a room mate. In regard to the room mate comment, he means that he doesn't like how I do some things on my own such as making tea for myself. I almost always ask him if he wants tea, coffee, food, etc. Sometimes I don't ask because I know that he will say no.

I'm just really scared because I don't think my husband values me. He angrily said to me yesterday that blood is blood and that's most important to him.  I feel as if I'm his second or even third priority.

He has his faults too but I never bring them up but I told him today from now on that I will bring up any issue I have with him immediately and he should do that too instead of letting it build up and exploding on me.

I basically fulfill all his needs yet I feel my needs aren't met. 

I am scared that his mother will interfere more in our lives, and I don't know how to have this conversation with him.

Please any guidance or advice is greatly appreciated!",3,1746228249.0,MuslimMarriage,1,1.0,False

How do i move forward?,"We dated for around 1.5 years and for the first year everything was really good, we were supportive of each other and we loved each other a lot. We didnt even fight that much and if we ever needed reassurance we were there for each other. It was the most healthy relationship I've had in my trashy life and I've been subject to alot of trauma which ive never told anyone other than her, She'd make me feel better about my self when it did affect me and our whole relationship was all I'd ever wanted and its all she wanted as well. We genuinely always were there for each other until august 2024.

We always had work and friends outside of us but the both of us got jealous when we hung out with anyone of the opposite gender so i reduced me talking to women over time and i completely stopped at one point for her sake, so did she but she still talked to maybe her older friends often which i didnt have an issue with.

As her college started in august 2024 i felt her moving away from me, i was always worried losing sleep over her and if She'd stay with me and I'd talk to her and tell her i dont like her doing X behavior and she reassured me but then after a week of not doing it she did it again. Other than that, around august i had this huge boat load of stressful events in my life related to my family which emotionally exhausted me. Around this time i started thinking if a break would be good  for us for her sake because i didnt want to affect her emotions negatively because I'm in a slump. She obviously denied one and i said okay.

Over august and september shit just kept getting worse, i worried and took more stress towards the relationship and would sometimes get angry at her for not taking my feelings seriously, i knew she loved me but my anxiety didnt let it sit. She would at this time take her musical career more seriously and joined a band at her college which performed gigs at coffee shops and such, i started taking my sport more seriously and had to travel between 3 main cities over the country constantly.

She never really made time for me, she never cancelled a practice or came out late while I would literally take an extra flight to see her and cancel races. I didnt do it so that she did that to me but it'd be nice for her to make time.  this and some other stuff really got to me and whenever i told her this She'd take me seriously and listen but never follow through with it.

In october i had a really bad illness for the better part of 2 weeks, i was in the hospital with an injection ever 2 hours without one proper nights sleep. During this i asked her if she could stay with me for extra time if she can't meet me and she said she would, but again she didn't follow through. Through September she talked about how excited she was for boyfriends day, i didnt really care at first but her excitement made me excited, unfortunately i was in the hospital at that time. 

That day something just flipped in me, she didnt text the entire day and i didnt call her at all, she reached home at around 10 which was normal because her practice would take up the entire evening, she spent time with her mom watching a movie and then at 11:58 she wished me ""happy boyfriends day i love you alot, im sorry i couldnt text today, im going to sleep."" After a full day of bleeding Through my nose and constant head aches and vomitting(she knew my condition) i got those 3 texts and that was it. I know it wasn't that big of a deal thinking back but her actions Through September and october now made me feel like shit and no matter how much i spoke to her, mo matter how much she loved me, she didn't show any real change.

After i got better i just looked at her different, she was the same, i know she loved me alot and she was really happy with me but i was miserable those 2 months and i couldn't take it literally begging for help, She'd cry when i told her how she treated me, but She'd never change enough to where it actually mattered.

Over the remaining half of october and first week of november i just couldn't deal with it, every 5 days id call her out on her shit and I'd get into an hour of just me insulting her for making me feel like this, i started saying i need a break up but she said we'll work through it like before and i believed her. She did change but only for a week and She'd start to revert, i told her i needed her support and that if she's not there when its like this i couldn't handle this stress and that we need to break up. She'd always hold me and say sorry for everything and I'd just melt like a popsicle and say sorry. I'd realise I'd done what i did after i saw her tears and id feel like shit for doing what i did.

After these 3-4 weeks of arguements i started feeling better, we became healthier again, it wasnt like before but it was a big step up and we kept on getting better. I had an international race which i was only really able to do with her support snd she won her singing fest. 

However whenever it deteriorated even by a little bit I'd get anxious and ask for her reassurance and if she couldn't provide it i felt abandoned so we had a minor arguement about it and it was sorted,she started to feel low because she couldnt keep me happy and i would cheer her up telling her how much i loved her and that we'll be better, just reassuring her in general

In december she stopped talking to me for 3 or 4 days straight and i felt like I was abandoned again, i couldnt deal with her games and asked for a break up, she cried saying that we'll still talk, and i still loved her and i said "" we'll still talk, we'll still meet, its just that i cant be there for you if you arent there for me right now, im really stressed and have too much stuff going on and i take it out on you"" she said it doesnt matter as long as im with her.

I regret doing that, she was depressive for 5 days and when i saw her she looked empty and sad, i went to her and gave her a hug telling her im always there for her, we cuddled and slept together and she said that she'll never leave my side and i said id never leave her side as well

Heres the confusing part 2 weeks later, just before christmas she said she wanted a break, i was confused and she said she doesnt want to talk to me at all without giving any reasons. When i asked for reasons she didnt provide them so i kept texting her when she wanted no contact, i spent christmas and new years alone worried about her when she went to some house party with close friends. I was depressed when she wouldnt tell me why.

In january she called me and said i want to meet, i said sure and she looked at me with the same love as before. We had the best date i ever had with her and she said she was super happy she could meet me and i was as well I said ""i love you"" and she hesitsted and didnt say it,we spoke more the day after the date but at the end of the day she said ""we're still going on no contact btw, just because im nice rn doesn't mean we're properly together""

Again i asked why so many times but this time she left me on seen

 she called me over again 3 weeks later and she said she wanted to break up, she adressed issues which i felt were already sorted(she herself said they were when we were together) and started talking to me like i was nothing, she laughed or smiled narcissistically while saying all this and she said something like ""my eyes opened and i don't love you anymore."" With a narcissistic smile on her face. It felt like she was possessed or something the way she spoke because that wasn't the girl i knew. I made an attempt to crack through that shell she set up and i held her in my arms and she started crying saying ""you hurt me"" ""i dont like who i am with you these past months"" and more stuff like that. I held her and consolled her telling her we can work it out easily if she just trusted me but she didnt believe me.

After this happened she changed so much, black nailpolish, red highlights in her hair, new hair cut, new dressing style, more social.

When i reached out for reasons which were valid(i feel there werent any and if they were it was could be easily worked out) she didnt respond and when she did completely changed towards me. One thing i remember she said was that she feels ""small"" with me, she said she's never had people let her feel ""small"" before, i asked what about me made her feel small and she said that i never laughed at her jokes when i always did, she said whatever things she did like her band, she thought i didnt think it was important when i did.

When we spoke She handled me with 0 care saying whatever she wanted, hurtful things i dont want to remember. I reached out to her for another chance and i felt she still loved me when we spoke about it, it was just this hard shell which she developed to protect herself.

Long story short she said yes we will try again but only for 2 weeks.... i said it wasnt enough time but she started saying she hated my mamannerisms. ""How you behave when you're talking to me about serious shit, how you eat food, how you smile, i hate your jokes now etc.""
She said that before the 2 weeks start she wanted a proper no contact for a week, and i said sure. However 4 days into that i found her liking some thirst trap which made me feel like shit, so i called her, asking her why did you like that and she said ""even if i like it it shouldnt affect you, we arent together."" To which i said so you can just hook up with someone else and it shouldnt bother me "" shes like even if i did hook up, which i havent, you have no right to control me"" 

I was like what the fuck, wdym we are on a break rn how can you just say that, she said its a break not a break up. I said that we agreed this was a break now because we are getting back together(replying to the text where she said that) and she left me on aüëç.

We cut the break short and she just argued with me, telling me im forcing her to try again, and trying to control her, she threw these words around so much it lost its meaning. I never forced her, i never controlled her so idk where this is coming from.

Before the 2 weeks started she said that she has 0 love for me in her heart and that she's trying again to see if she can love me again

Over the 2 weeks she was harsh and cold, narcissistic and denying accountability. Any thing that i felt needed to be brought up was brushed off and i ran after her like a dog. 

The 1st week was the best imo, we kept on improving every day, I'd ask her how does she feel talking to me and by the end of the week she said she was happy to talk to me, there was a glow in her eyes again. It was working when she stfu and listened to me.
BUTTTT
then she stopped talking again, for 3 days and when she came back reverted to whatever she was before that. 2 days into the second week she said ""i dont love you and i can't, im only doing these next 5 days for the sake of doing it so i can get rid of you"" you can guess how this 2nd week went, on the last day she said she hated me and i asked for a hug which she didnt want to give, when i hugged her i kissed her forehead and said i loved her, when i pulled away i saw a tear in her eye but she pushed me away. I asked her why did she say she liked talking to me over the 1st week and she said ""i was ignoring my own feelings""

Over the 2nd week i asked her what love meant to her and she said it was 70% feelings and 30% choice and actions. I said its stupid and immature to think that was as everything she did made sense to me now. I tried talking sense to her and she said ""stop trying to force me and control me""

Fyi, she was never like this before december, over the time we were actually together she was the complete opposite, literally anyones perfect partner. I feel she still has a part of her that loves me and that that part knows we work well but this hard shell of hers is here rn because i hurt her. I want her back so bad, i want to cup her face and kiss her and love her till i die and i didnt even get to do that.

I have a really bad brain condition which causes me strokes and nose/ear bleeds. Idk if I'll live till the end of this year if i keep taking stress, she doesnt know this and if i told her idt this hard part of her would care

Recently i called her to tell her i missed her and she said that she's happier talking and being social with her college friends (mostly guys) other than being in a relationship with me or anyone. I know that isnt true because of what she told me when we were together and i refuse to believe people change so fast.

Just last night she featured on a song with a guy friend she's known since 2021, he's like 8 years older and dating another woman. There wasn't any video or anything just her adlibs about dick being thick and some other shit which made me vomit. I feel like she cheated on me and changed but part of me feels like she wouldn't cheat on me. I'm between 2 worlds of this new side being how it is she might but the person i once loved that promised to take care of me.",2,1746228008.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Golden State Warriors versus the Houston Rockets in Game 6 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs. It's like watching a classic movie where you already know the ending, but you can't help but enjoy the drama unfold. The Warriors are at home, and if there's one thing we know about them, it's that they treat their home court like a fortress guarded by Steph Curry's three-point arrows and Draymond Green's defensive shields.

The Rockets, bless their hearts, are trying to keep their season alive. They've shown flashes of brilliance, like a firework that almost reaches the sky but fizzles out just before the grand finale. Alperen Sengun, Fred VanVleet, and Jalen Green are the main actors in this underdog story, but consistency has been as elusive as a unicorn in Houston's offense.

The oddsmakers have the Warriors as favorites, with a spread of -5.5. It's like they're saying, ""Sure, the Rockets might put up a fight, but don't bet your lunch money on it."" The Warriors' moneyline is at 1.42, which is about as close to a sure thing as you'll find in the unpredictable world of sports betting.

Steve Kerr, the Warriors' coach, is probably sipping his coffee, plotting how to keep Fred VanVleet under 14.5 points. Meanwhile, Steph Curry is likely practicing his three-point shots with the precision of a surgeon, ready to ensure this series doesn't drag on to a Game 7.

So, what's the best bet here? Take the Warriors to win and cover the -5.5 spread. It's the safer bet, and let's be honest, betting against the Warriors at home in a closeout game is like betting against gravity. You might be right one day, but today is not that day. Enjoy the game, and may your bets be as accurate as a Curry three-pointer!

1kdennm,https://i.redd.it/p4odxp3pagye1.jpeg,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA): A Window Into Your Body's Mineral and Toxic Metal Status,"

# 

In today‚Äôs world, we are constantly exposed to toxins‚Äîwhether through food, cosmetics, pollution, or even our daily coffee. This constant exposure can take a toll on our body, leading to imbalances in essential nutrients and the accumulation of harmful substances like heavy metals. One valuable tool to assess these imbalances is¬†**Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)**.





# What is HTMA?

**Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)**¬†is a safe, non-invasive test that measures the levels of both essential and toxic minerals in a small sample of hair. The test provides insights into a person's overall health, revealing mineral imbalances or the presence of harmful heavy metals that may not show up in traditional blood or urine tests. Since hair grows over time, it offers a record of the body‚Äôs mineral levels over several months, giving a broader picture of long-term health trends‚Äã(Hair Tissue Mineral Ana‚Ä¶).

# Why Test for Minerals and Heavy Metals?

Minerals play a vital role in maintaining the body's core functions, from energy production and muscle contractions to nerve activity and enzyme reactions. They act as the ""spark plugs"" of life. Ideally, we would receive all necessary minerals from a well-balanced diet, but modern agricultural techniques, depleted soils, and processed foods often reduce the nutrient content of what we eat‚Äã(Hair Tissue Mineral Ana‚Ä¶).

Moreover, the environment introduces numerous toxic substances, such as heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic) that can accumulate in the body over time. Excessive levels of these toxins can contribute to a range of health problems, including:

# The Benefits of HTMA

The HTMA test provides reliable data on over¬†**35 essential minerals and toxic metals**, as well as more than¬†**25 important mineral ratios**. This analysis can help detect issues like mineral deficiencies or toxic overloads that may be affecting your health. By identifying these imbalances, HTMA allows for personalized health plans, including dietary changes and targeted supplementation, to restore balance and improve overall well-being‚Äã(Hair Tissue Mineral Ana‚Ä¶).

Some benefits of HTMA include:

* **Non-invasive and safe**: Only a small sample of hair is required.
* **Comprehensive analysis**: It reveals mineral imbalances and the presence of toxic metals.
* **Actionable results**: Provides personalized dietary and supplement recommendations for better health.
* Provides reliable data on 35 essential minerals and toxic metals.
* Reveals information that blood and urine tests may miss.
* Identifies mineral imbalances and toxic metal excesses that affect health.

# Who Should Consider an HTMA Test?

HTMA testing is recommended for people experiencing unexplained health issues, such as chronic fatigue, persistent muscle pain, or hormonal imbalances. It is also beneficial for those undergoing pre-conception care, as exposure to toxic metals can negatively impact fetal development. Moreover, people living in environments with high pollution or those concerned about their long-term exposure to toxins can benefit from this analysis‚Äã(Hair Tissue Mineral Ana‚Ä¶).

# Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA): A Window Into Your Body's Mineral and Toxic Metal Status

In today‚Äôs world, we are constantly exposed to toxins‚Äîwhether through food, cosmetics, pollution, or even our daily coffee. This constant exposure can take a toll on our body, leading to imbalances in essential nutrients and the accumulation of harmful substances like heavy metals. One valuable tool to assess these imbalances is¬†**Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)**.

1kdelth,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1kdelth/petunia_on_paper_part_one/,Petunia on Paper - Part One,"I struggle against the mild summer breeze, pulling open the stubbornly heavy glass door of the PennDOT Driver License Center, stepping immediately into a wall of stale, artificially cooled air. The atmosphere presses in on me, thick with the scent of ink, plastic laminate, and the sharp, lingering odor of burnt coffee from a neglected vending machine in the corner. My heart skitters nervously as I look around. Rows of rigid plastic chairs filled with people trapped in the slow torment of bureaucracy. An old man gripping his cane like a lifeline, a mother whispering threats to a fidgety toddler, a teenager slouched low, hoodie pulled up, thumbs scrolling his phone.

I freeze just over the threshold. My pulse is racing. No one has looked up yet, but it‚Äôs inevitable. My nervous fingers smooth reflexively over the front of my blush-pink pencil skirt. Scandalously snug. Chosen not *by* me but *for* me. Beneath the taut fabric, I worry the bulk from the chastity device and gaff might betray me if I move wrong. My cheeks grow hot.

A weary woman behind the closest counter, blue dress faded beneath a gray cardigan, mechanically chews gum. Her eyes flick up to mine, but she barely registers me before she returns to the paper she‚Äôs reading. ""Take a ticket,"" she says. Flat.

My carefully manicured nails, lacquered a delicate pale pink, fumble awkwardly at the red dispenser. The little white slip is dominated by the number 78. One quick scan and I find the glowing LED display behind the counter. 63. My stomach tightens. Too much time. Not enough time? I‚Äôm torn between wanting to rush through this so I can flee and wanting to savor the last few minutes of my old life. I close my eyes and push out a slow deep breath, just trying to regain a handle on myself.

I mince toward the waiting area, feeling more exposed with every precise step. The steady click of my rose patent leather stilettos against the faded linoleum is an unrelenting announcement of my presence. As I walk, I can feel more and more eyes awaken from tedium to gawk at me. I ignore them all. There‚Äôs an empty chair in the back row, somewhat shielded from curious eyes. I lower myself slowly. It doesn‚Äôt help. The jeweled base of the heavy plug clunks against the unforgiving plastic seat. I wince, ears scorching.

Folding my hands tightly in my lap, I grip them fiercely, fighting the urge to fidget or adjust. I stare straight ahead, smiling vapidly, just waiting for the final few gawkers to realize their faux pas and look away.¬†

A chime sounds, crisp and impersonal, followed by a crackling voice over the speaker. ""Sixty-four to window four."" I find my ticket again. Fourteen people ahead of me. That has to mean at least an hour sitting here, trying to avoid the looks. Pretending I‚Äôm just another bored patron.

My fingers absentmindedly clutch my glossy pink patent leather purse, brushing the edge of the manila folder inside, feeling the weight of its contents. Official. Final. Permanent. Can I do it? Could I stop this even if I wanted to? My stomach twists again.¬†

Face downcast, I steal cautious glances from behind thick lashes, retreating with even the hint of someone's eyes connecting with mine. The walls are painted that same lifeless shade of gray that seems to exist solely in government buildings. Oppressive in their uniformity. The ceiling tiles haven‚Äôt been white for ages. A television in the corner drones quietly, looping bland PennDOT announcements, too soft to hear over the restless hum of the waiting room.

My heart contracts suddenly as a rough-looking man in a worn flannel shifts in his seat one row ahead, turning slightly my way. My adrenaline spikes, sharp and immediate. I choose flight. My chin drops. A curtain of honey-blonde curls spills forward in a protective golden veil. I clamp my eyes shut, willing my nerves to stop vibrating. As I breathe, reality wavers and blurs, slipping quietly away.

Suddenly I'm with Brooke, back on our old couch, the soft cushions familiar beneath me. The flickering television is the only light in the room, gently casting shifting, comforting shadows across the modest home I once knew. A home that belonged to Peter, never really to Petunia.

We‚Äôre curled up, watching some exaggerated action show she chose. Hyper-masculine heroes solving impossible crises with steely gazes and clenched fists. I sat quietly, pretending interest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always preferred softer men,‚Äù she said. Just announcing it out of nowhere. Casually. A smirk dancing across her lips as she looks at me. I‚Äôd been getting used to comments like these. Seemingly innocuous, but each one struck deeper than I cared to admit. I guess she already knew who I was even before I did.

This time I decided to stay silent. By then I knew that anything I said in protest would just earn me the charge of being ‚Äúdefensive.‚Äù Then after that, no matter what I would say, the following conversation would only draw teasing reassurance from her.¬†

Brooke didn‚Äôt let me off that easily tonight though. Something was different about her this time. Probably the three glasses of wine she‚Äôd had. She stretched languidly, toes playfully grazing my thigh, her smile deepening.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she murmured, twisting a strand of dark hair around one elegant finger, ‚Äúit might be fun to explore that.‚Äù

I remember forcing myself to look at her with confusion, but I knew what she meant. Somehow I knew. I just couldn‚Äôt let her know that I knew. It might let on.

She drenched her countenance in allure. Her hazel eyes looked to be calculating for just a heartbeat before she pressed on. ‚ÄúWith‚Ä¶ the idea of it. Of being softer.‚Äù Her foot was caressing me. She kept going, her voice lilting, teasing but not cruel. ‚ÄúWhat if you tried wearing panties? Just once? Just for me?‚Äù She batted her lashes, and puckered her heart shaped lips.

The question hit like a spark in dry brush, igniting something deep inside me. I remember the rush.I remember hesitating just a heartbeat too long. I forced a laugh, feigning casual dismissal. ""I don't know. I'd probably look ridiculous.""

A desperate lie. Brooke saw through it. She pushed and prodded. Her playful suggestion quickly became gentle but relentless insistence. She has always known how to get her way. I don‚Äôt remember her exact words, but she continued until I gave in.¬†

‚ÄúJust a little fun, just for you,‚Äù I agreed. Blood was already surging to all the right places.¬†

At first, she made it feel like a game, but the moment the silky fabric hugged my hips, something shifted. She turned ravenous. Her body enveloped mine.¬†

Thinking about it now, I can almost feel her lips, hot and demanding. She gripped my hair and pulled me down, mouth to pussy. She pushed me back onto the bed, crawled on top, and rode me. First my face and then my cock. Her nails left ghostly trails all across my back and shoulders.¬†

Even before that night, she had always been the one to steer our sexual encounters, but she had never taken me like that before. Never with such control. Such certainty. It was amazing. And after that night, she never stopped.

A soft chime breaks my reverie, just loud enough to cut through the restless murmur of the PennDOT waiting area. Everyone looks up simultaneously at the harsh red glow of the LED display. 65. Closer. Too close.

One of the clerks behind the counter, a heavyset woman with bright red wavy hair and sagging cheeks, forgoing the microphone, calls out saccharine sweet, ‚ÄúNumber sixty-five.‚Äù Her smile doesn‚Äôt go past her cheeks. She‚Äôs trapped here just like everyone else.

A gray, liver-spotted man sitting two rows ahead of me and one seat to the right hauls himself up with his cane and starts a slow shamble to her counter.¬†

‚ÄúWhat can I help you with?‚Äù Dead-eyes asks him before he even reaches her desk. Her words, still full of empty cheer, trumpet across the room.¬†

He ignores her, concentrating on finishing his slow shuffle to the front. She keeps her giant cheeks raised into that forced smile, staring impatiently. Like she can speed him up with veiled irritation.

I tug my lustrous short skirt further down my soft, tan, bare thighs, shifting my body first one way, and then the other. The girthy toy she buried in me this morning joysticks back and forth when I do. Massaging me deep. My body hums. I close my eyes and remember the first time I felt that addicting feeling.

‚ÄúYou look perfect,‚Äù Brooke whispered into my ear, standing behind me as we gazed into the full-length mirror. Her fingers traced my hips, caressing me through the silky purple babydoll she‚Äôd brought home for me. ‚ÄúThis suits you.‚Äù

We'd been playing these games for weeks by this time, but until that night I'd always borrowed clothes from her. A feeble protest got lodged in my throat on its way out, stilled by the softness staring back at me. The person in the mirror was delicate, feminine, alien. It was like I noticed a crack running through me where I once thought I was whole. I wanted this. But I didn‚Äôt want to want this.

That night I spent nearly an hour between Brooke's thighs, wordlessly thanking her, drowning in her demands. Something in me yearned to please her. Whenever I ached for my own relief, my hand would drift downward, but she always slapped it away and called me ‚Äònaughty.‚Äô Then she‚Äôd fix me with an amused smirk, challenging me to protest, but I just couldn't. She effortlessly wielded control, leaving me eager, throbbing, and frustrated. That somehow made me want to please her even more.

After she'd shuddered through her third climax, her skin flushed and glowing, she finally granted me my cure. Gripping my penis tightly through my new velvety negligee, she yanked out three firm strokes. I spilled helplessly all over myself, trembling. Utterly spent. As I lay collapsed, her laughter rang out clear and fervent. It was patronizing. Like I had just surrendered that missing piece of myself to her.

The speaker jolts me back, sharp and intrusive. ‚ÄúNumber sixty-six, window one,‚Äù cuts through the sterile air. The numbers change on the screen. My breath catches. Too fast. This is moving too fast.¬†

I squeeze the purse again, the edge of the folder inside almost slices into my palm trying to draw a flood oath from me. A tangible reminder of this irrevocable step. The paperwork is complete. Everything has been ready for weeks. Still, doubt gnaws at my resolve. Am I losing myself or finally finding the woman Brooke insists I am meant to be? Would I have discovered this without her guiding hand?¬†

Another memory rushes forward, impossible to resist, carrying me back to Brooke‚Äôs twenty-seventh birthday. She didn't want extravagance, just a quiet evening at home. Her casual elegance always disarmed me.¬†

She was already home, curled up on the couch, when I walked in from work. Oversized hoodie, snug leggings, dark hair twisted into a careless bun. Warm lamplight cast gentle shadows across her perfect features. She was a queen waiting for someone to serve her.

Before I'd even closed the door, her playful voice was already outgunning the trepidation that I‚Äôd been feeling ever since she announced her private celebration to me. ‚ÄúI laid the stockings and garter out on the bed for you,‚Äù she said. She never asked anymore. She expected.

I watched her for a few seconds, heat surging across my face. She was already back to her reality show. Some trashy drama she loved and I couldn‚Äôt stand. I wasn‚Äôt even sure why I felt angry. I‚Äôd agreed to this days ago. Still, the truth gnawed at me. Somewhere along the way, I‚Äôd stopped having a say in anything.

She looked back at me like she suddenly remembered something. Not registering my frustration, she asked for more. ‚ÄúSweetie, we haven‚Äôt talked about this yet, but could you do something to make this birthday extra special for me?‚Äù My pulse quickened, sensing the trap beneath her sweetness.

‚ÄúBefore you dress,‚Äù she casually continued, ‚Äúdo you think you could shave your body? I was thinking about it, and you would look so much prettier without all the body hair.‚Äù

The room got smaller. There was a hammering in my ears. I opened my mouth to object, but found my throat too dry. She simply sat there smiling, eyes glittering like topaz. Calm. Confident. It always seemed like she was daring me to stand up. To say no. I didn‚Äôt say a word, I merely nodded.

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù she purred, dismissing me with a wave. ‚ÄúI left a new razor and special cream in the shower. Only the best for you.‚Äù

Halfway down the hall, she called out again, stopping me mid-step. ‚ÄúSweetie? Wouldn‚Äôt it be hot if you cooked that lemon leek dish you do while you were dressed too?‚Äù I continued walking, heart pounding, trapped in her web. What could I have done? Any hesitancy I ever voiced always got thwarted by some airy instruction on my ‚Äútrue nature.‚Äù

The buzz of fluorescent lights pulls me sharply back to the present. I‚Äôve been staring off into space. I blink rapidly, forcing the memory aside. It clings stubbornly, lingering like Brooke‚Äôs perfume.¬†

I start to realize that was the moment. That was my last chance to stop this freight train. To keep the game just about panties. But I couldn‚Äôt. Brooke‚Äôs intentions ran deeper, subtler. For her it was never just about panties. She wanted everything from me, and it is obvious now that her careful guidance over the following few months was always meant to drive me toward this.¬†

I suppose after that night I could have insisted she only control my private life, but somehow she spread beyond that too. My surrender came quietly, inevitably, as Brooke slowly introduced more things that rippled across my life. The nightly skincare routines, the growth and meticulous grooming of my hair and nails, they way she taught me to walk more feminine.¬†

These things piled up and eventually became impossible to hide from curious coworkers and inquisitive friends. I‚Äôd try to make jokes about it. About how modern men aren‚Äôt afraid of the softer things in life anymore. It never worked, and their probing questions always chipped away at my fragile confidence.

I came up with a plan to make it easier to tell her no. To shift my reluctance to something else. The need for professional conduct. One night, tucked neatly into the fold of her body, my face and chin drenched with her juices, my head rising and falling with her chest, I summoned all my courage and whispered up to her, ‚ÄúMaybe we've gone far enough.‚Äù

She lifted her head to look down at me, her brow raised in taunting surprise. I tried to meet her eyes, but I couldn‚Äôt. I just laid my ear back against her chest.

I forced myself to press on. ‚ÄúPeople at work are noticing.‚Äù My voice was tissue paper.

She tutted and began gently brushing my cheek. After a long disquieting lul she finally responded. Sympathetic yet firm. ‚ÄúJudgments are unfair. I understand, baby.‚Äù¬†

I breathed a deep sigh of relief, and melted into her. Until I realized she never really addressed the issue. What exactly was her decision? I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to ask her. My ribs tightened around my heart every time I tried.¬†

Less than two days later, her true intentions emerged with ruthless clarity.",2,1746227330.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

1kdelgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1kdelgd/2year_anniversary_of_dday_what_next/,2-year anniversary of D-Day - what next?,"Forgive the length, hopefully I‚Äôve written with clarity.

Some background. We‚Äôve been together since 2009, and had our ups and downs, and were married in 2016. We have two kids together and live a very comfortable, happy, fulfilled life.

Back in March 2023, my wife‚Äôs old friend from College was in town with his wife. They live on a far away continent, and she hasn't seen them in years. After some weird vibes, and some weirder conversations with my wife about said vibes, my gut kicks me into action and I snoop an old phone. I find some nude pictures and some suggestive texts from 2017. I confront her and what follows is a week of TT as I slowly uncover more evidence and force her to come clean. Before his arrival, I had zero clue this guy was a threat, and was only vaguely aware he existed as a friend. Let‚Äôs call DDay May 1, 2023.

Now, two years later, I‚Äôve pieced together a version of their relationship, but so many holes remain. It goes something like this:

* Turns out that this ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù (which started sometime in 2011/2012) started to include emotional and sexual intimacy in 2013, in the form of suggestive photos and talks of sexual fantasies. I‚Äôd characterize this part of their relationship as inappropriate flirting.
* In 2014, they randomly bumped into each other while travelling and mutually expressed their attraction and desires for one another. Subsequent emails wax poetic about what it would be like to be together, and the various issues in their current relationships (i.e., with me). I‚Äôve found some mysterious nude photos from this year that she was unable to confirm who they were for (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember‚Äù).
* Evidence trail goes mostly cold during 2015-2016. They are clearly maintaining a friendship during this time, but I haven‚Äôt seen or read anything egregious (doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt happen!). There are breadcrumbs of an affair though (e.g. late nigh Skype conversation that may or may not be a result of his living on a different continent; suggestive texts with her girlfriends about him; etc.).
* We get married in 2016.
* For some reason, they start an extensive sexting relationship in 2017. From the photos I‚Äôve found, it starts in June. This persists until she gets pregnant in late-2018, at which point the physical transformation of her pregnancy puts a damper on the sexting.
* After the birth of our first child in 2019, she tries to ""keep things platonic."" I‚Äôve seen evidence of these efforts in text conversations, but she seemed to always fail and revert to inappropriateness. For example, after declining an offer for a dick pic, she follows up a few days later with a sex dream she had of him. ¬†
* They seem to exist in this gray area of inappropriate-but-not-outright-sexual-exchange relationship through to 2023 when I make her block his dumb ass. ¬†¬†

Put it all together, and you have an emotionally and sexually intimate relationship that ebbed and flowed continuously for 10 years. She swears nothing physical happened, which is probably true given the ocean and continent between them, but the eventual intensity of their sexual exchange gives me pause.

So here we are 2 years out. I‚Äôve been in consistent IC, and she consistently arranges MC sessions for us. I have good days and bad. Mostly though, I‚Äôm tortured by the things I don‚Äôt know. For example, I don‚Äôt know if she was sexting him before our wedding. I don‚Äôt know if the sexting began in 2014 and never stopped. I don‚Äôt know if it truly began in 2017, and if so, why then? ¬†Did it truly only stop in 2023 when I caught her? Do these questions even matter? Do I already know enough?

She has been forthcoming with some information, including showing me a pretty bonkers conversation between them, and an admission they secretly went for coffee (with my infant baby present) in 2023. At the beginning she was quite patient with my need to talk and obsessively go over details, but ultimately many of her answers were ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember‚Äù or frustratingly vague. Now, I can see frustration creeping in when we talk about things as she (correctly) sees this as us going over the same ground with nothing new to say.

Insofar as her ""reasons"" and motivations. Its clear she has a deep need for validation. She says she viewed this relationship as a ""fantasy"" and never one that would replace our own. She seems to have also compartmentalized it very well, likely owing to its existence on her phone and not so much in ""real"" life. There are also various rationalizations (that are mostly bullshit), that range from ""I thought you wouldn't care"" to ""I was his safe sexual outlet, that prevented him from *actually* cheating on his wife.""

So what should I make of this? Am I totally fucked because I‚Äôve married a woman that has fallen so far down a moral sinkhole that its not worth throwing her a rope? Or is this a result of someone who I know can compartmentalize like champ, is very conflict avoidant, and happens to have a pathological need for validation ‚Äì and thus someone who can turn it around and be a safe partner?

I really enjoy my life (this bullshit notwithstanding), and the thought of not seeing my kids everyday fills me with dread. But I‚Äôm feeling like its been two years I need to shit or get off the pot. Meaning i'd like to move towards forgiveness and stay, or leave.  Any advice welcomed.

1kdeeb7,https://i.redd.it/lrlrkm4d8gye1.png,Help me figure out how to decorate living room and den,"To clarify some confusion on the floor plan, I have the Alt Layout, so my Den is 10' x 5'. We only have a coffee table, L couch (IKEA) and TV. We were planning to just use the den to store things since we have a lot of outdoor items (fishing rods, camping gear, snowboard gear), but we are open to ideas. Thank you!",1,1746226756.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False
1kdee0s,https://i.redd.it/g9k38c7m8gye1.jpeg,Very first tirasmu attempt (amateur),"I don't even own an electric whisk (one has now been ordered). It was all by hand to make the stiff peaks - a very rewarding process! I love this dessert and really wanted to know what it'd be like if I ever wanted to make it myself. 

This is my very first attempt so there is lots I could improve on. It took 3 days total (to make the mascarpone from scratch and to make lady fingers that turned a bit stale for dunking in coffee). 

Happy baking all!",244,1746226732.0,Baking,17,1.0,False

A few weeks ago, I started not being able to sleep and just staying up for 1-2 hrs in bed before sleeping and not sure if the coffee might be the reason why. It was also during exam times so the stress could also be a potential reason. I now really really crave coffee again so does anyone know if it‚Äôs alright to drink these 2 daily?",17,1746226624.0,VietNam,29,0.79,False
