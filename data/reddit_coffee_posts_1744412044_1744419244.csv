I’m super new to espresso (as in… I just learned what a portafilter is 😅), but after some research, I’m hooked.

I’m currently debating between:

1. **Sage Barista Express** (€499) – all-in-one, beginner-friendly, seems perfect to get started fast
2. **Gaggia Classic Pro E24 + Eureka Mignon Silenzio** (€929) – the “real barista” setup that’s a bit more intimidating, but probably more rewarding in the long run

What's your take? Better to dive into the deep end or start humble and see how it goes? Any advice from those who’ve been there would be amazing! 🙏",1,1744419118.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Stopped and restarted saxenda after a week’s gap of going cold turkey. Ask me anything about stopping and restarting,"So I went cold turkey a week ago. I wasn’t experiencing any weight loss and injecting 3mg a day. A pen would last only 5 days and it was costing me a fortune to keep going without any visible benefits. 

The side effects of stopping suddenly were bad but bearable. The only thing that bothered me was the return on my appetite towards sugary things. It was more of a return with a vengeance. Also, my cravings for alcohol, especially beer, were like I’d never witnessed before. So I guess the suppression does come back harder. Or maybe it is that I was off of these things for so long that it’s just normal and I feel it more because I’ve been off of them for so long. 

Anyways. My experience after taking a shot last night.  

First and foremost, diarrhoea. If you have diarrhoea it means saxenda has started to work. Yes it is bothersome but nothing I didn’t first experience when I started saxenda for the first time. Hunger is lower than before. I only have a scoop of protein in water and I feel satiated. Yesterday morning, I needed to have two eggs, some fruit, some almonds, some raisins and a coffee. I still felt hungry within an hour. And I’m not saying hi hey in my head. My stomach growled and roared. My colleagues were asking me if I was ok since my stomach was making strange noises and the noises were very very audible. 

I started at 0,6mg dose. 

Ask me anything related to restart and I’ll try answering to the best of my capacity. My goal here is to provide a knowledge base of how your body may react if you have plateaued and are thinking of stopping and restarting.",2,1744418622.0,liraglutide,0,1.0,False

————————

Harper's POV
I awoke to the sensation of my left arm having gone numb and Shelby's hair tickling my face. Looking to my right, I see Joy and Ed cuddled up with one another. Joy being the little spoon to his big spoon. Carefully, I removed my arm from beneath Shelby's head, substituting it with a pillow in an effort not to disturb her sleep. I quietly found my phone and tiptoed out of the guest room, careful not to wake anyone from their sleep. I made my way to the master suite to get ready and start preparing breakfast.
Seeing that it was 7:50 in the morning and I hadn't managed to talk with Ethan yesterday, I decided to call him and check in on him. The phone rang to no avail. This was somewhat unsettling, as it was not like him to not answer my calls or check on me. I considered the possibility that he might be busy and would call me back.
After getting ready for the day, I made my way downstairs deciding to prepare chicken and waffles with an assortment of fresh fruits for us. We all like it and its especially Shelby's favorite, and since I've already made Ed and Joy's favorite food it's only fair to make hers. I gather the ingredients for the Belgian waffle. Once the batter was ready, I got the seasoned chicken from yesterday ready to fry. I started brewing a pot of coffee, to get our day started. Afterwards, I prepared fresh orange juice for the mimosas. Making sure to keep Gatorade within reach, to help combat the aftermath of last night's festivities.
As Shelby made her way down the stairs, the coffee machine went off with a beep. ""You're just in time,"" I greeted her. ""Could you grab the creamer from the fridge?"" I asked, while I reached for two mugs from the cabinet, filling them with the freshly brewed coffee.
Roughly 30 minutes later, Ed and Joy joined us in the kitchen. Together, we enjoyed the breakfast spread and mapped out our day: a trip to the beach followed by lunch at SIS's Cafe, one of our favorite spots.
....
My phone started ringing, I glanced at the screen to see Ethan's name. Feeling a wave of relief wash over me, I excused myself from the group and answered the call in the privacy of the living room. Ethan shared the frustrating news that the new vendor was hesitant to sign the contract, saying that he might need to extend his business trip.
I offered my help, wondering if there was anything I could do to lighten his load. He reassured me, insisting that he had everything under control and to have fun with my friends. As our conversation ended, I expressed my love for him, to which he responded, ""Me too."" His reply, lacking the usual warmth of ""I love you too"" or the playful ""I love you more"" I was accustomed to, struck me as odd. However, I chose not to linger on the thought, perhaps he wasn't alone.
Feeling a little dejected, I returned to the kitchen to rejoin my friends, the brief exchange with Ethan casting a subtle shadow over my spirits. The shift in our interaction, though minor, left me with a pang of unease as I tried to shake it off and focus on the comfort and camaraderie awaiting me.
""Everything okay?"" Joy asked, her keen eyes searching mine for the truth.
""I believe so,"" I responded, forcing a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes.
""Who do we need to destroy?"" Ed's question, half-joking yet underlined with concern, broke through the tension.
Touched by the protectiveness his words implied. I responded ""Nobody.""
....
2 Weeks Later...
While engrossed in my work in the office, the unexpected sound of the doorbell caught my attention. With Ethan at work and Ms. Ellis having the day off, I wasn't expecting any visitors at this hour. Wondering who it could be.
I made my way to the entrance, I opened the door to find myself face to face with an astonishingly large bouquet of red roses, so enormous that managing it alone seemed like a daunting task. Thankfully, the delivery man lent a helping hand. In gratitude I handed him a $20 tip and thanked him. With the bouquet now inside, I eagerly searched for the card among the roses to read the sender's message.
My Dearest Harper,
Happy Valentine's Day to the woman who has filled my life with love and joy beyond measure. Today, more than any other day, I want to express how deeply grateful I am to have you by my side. You are my best friend, my confidante, and the love of my life. Your strength, kindness, and unwavering support inspire me every day.
With each year that passes, my love for you only grows stronger, and I find myself falling more in love with you in ways I never thought possible. You have a way of making even the simplest moments special, and I cherish every laugh, every conversation, and every quiet moment we share.
Today, I promise to continue cherishing you, honoring you, and loving you with all that I am. Thank you for being you. For your love, your laughter, and your beautiful heart. I look forward to all the adventures and memories we have yet to make together.
Happy Valentine's Day, my love.
Forever and always,
Ethan
As I unfolded the note and read its contents, a wave of emotions washed over me. His heartfelt message made me feel incredibly fortunate; to have a husband as thoughtful and loving as Ethan truly is a blessing.
...
For Valentine's Day, I arranged a romantic three-course dinner to celebrate our love. Meticulously planning each detail to ensure an unforgettable evening.
Our menu for the night included:
1st Course:
Fried Calamari with Jalapeño, offering a delightful blend of crispiness and a hint of spice to start our meal.
2nd Course:
The highlight of our dinner was the Lobster Risotto, the combination of the creamy risotto with the sweet lobster meat was mouthwatering good.
3rd Course:
Fried Ice Cream, served with whipped cream, a generous drizzle of chocolate crowned with a cherry, providing a sweet and satisfying finale to our meal.
I paired our meal with a bottle of Burgundy Chardonnay, its rich flavors perfectly complemented the dishes.
To further enhance the ambiance of our Valentine's celebration, I prepared a relaxing bath for Ethan, infused with CBD bath bombs designed to alleviate stress and anxiety. The combination of CBD oil, lavender, and chamomile in the bath created an atmosphere of perfect relaxation. With soft music playing in the background and the lights dimmed, the mood was set for a night of romance and passion.
Ethan was extremely pleased with the evening's arrangements. ""Sweetheart this is by far one of the best date every,"" I love you he proclaimed. ""I love you too,"" Happy Valentine's Day celebration I said with a kis s.
.....
3 Days After Valentine's Day...
Since the successful launch of Premier Furniture-LUXE Ethan has been even busier than before. As his wife, I understood the pressures he faced and supported him wholeheartedly. So, when he informed me, he'd be late again, asking me to eat without him, I complied, saving his meal for later. That evening, as I connected with friends and scrolled through social media, the hours slipped by until Ethan's return.
He came home, weary yet eager to share the day's progress. After reheating his dinner, we retreated to our bedroom, where he made his way into the end-suite bathroom, leaving behind his phone and watch on the nightstand. A moment that would irrevocably alter the course of our lives.
As I settled into bed, aiming to wind down, his phone lit up with a notification. Assuming it was a work-related urgency, I reached for his phone to deliver it to him. However, the message displayed on the screen stopped me dead in my tracks, sending shockwaves through my very being.
Disbelief washed over me as I stared, wide-eyed, at the revelation on Ethan's phone screen.
Taking a deep steadying breath to calm my shaking hands, I quickly grabbed my phone and captured a photo of the screen for evidence. Carefully, I placed his phone back on the nightstand, making sure everything looked untouched. Then with a heavy heart of emotions churning inside me, I quietly exited the room.
I made my way to my office, gently closing the door behind me, an uproar of emotions threatening to spill over as tears. ""Breathe, Harper, breathe,"" I whispered
to myself, trying to steady my racing heart and stop the storm of feelings swirling within. It was crucial to approach this situation with a level head. Reminding myself of the importance of not jumping to conclusions without the full picture, I knew I needed undeniable evidence.
Upon returning to our room, I found Ethan already asleep in bed. Despite my body's exhaustion I couldn't sleep, my mind was in turmoil, flooded with unanswered questions. Who was Kin? Where had they met? Was Ethan truly being unfaithful? How long had it been going on? Were his late nights at work and business trips genuine, or just a cover for something else? What had caused this rift between us? Doubts about my appearance, my success, and my worthiness as a partner swirled through my head, questioning why I wasn't enough.
Despite my efforts to hold back the tears, they flowed uncontrollably. The pain and confusion I felt was unbearable. At some point during the night, overwhelmed by emotional exhaustion I finally drifted into a fitful sleep, the questions still echoing unanswered in my dreams.
....
The following morning, I awoke feeling under the weather, both emotionally and physically drained from the night before. Determined to keep a facade of normalcy, I dragged myself to the bathroom and went through the motions of getting ready, trying my best to compose myself and piece together my outward appearance, hoping it would somehow fix my inner turmoil.
I prepared a simple but nutritious breakfast of barley porridge, using coconut milk for a creamy texture. I then topped it with a colorful mix of blueberries, mango, and raspberries. This quick concoction offered a comforting start to the gloomy day.
When Ethan came down for breakfast, he immediately sensed that something was off with my usual cheerful demeanor and inquired if I was alright. Masking my inner turmoil, I explained that I had woken up feeling unwell, avoiding the truth that I found it difficult to even look at him without going off. He suggested I rest and take some medicine, concern evident in his voice. As he leaned in for a goodbye pecking, a gesture that used to warm my heart, I struggled to hide my instinct to pull away. This once cherished tradition now became a moment filled with doubt and questions.
Heading to my office, my initial thought was to reach out to Shelby, but I decided against it, feeling the need to handle things on my own for the moment. First step, I changed the passwords to all my personal accounts. My next action led me to try accessing Ethan's email. The first attempt to log in was unsuccessful, but persistence paid off on the second try. What I found was a heart-wrenching confirmation of my worst fears: hotel reservations, restaurant bookings, and delivery confirmations for items that were never meant for me. However, the ultimate incriminating evidence were the intercourse videos of Ethan and his mistress save on his cloud storage. Each discovery was like a blow to my heart, I felt physically ill.
Overwhelmed by betrayal and nausea I rushed to the powder room to vomit. After composing myself as best as I could, rinsing my mouth and splashing water on my face to wash away the nausea and disbelief, I returned to the computer. With a heavy heart, I began to document and gather as much information as possible, knowing that these pieces of evidence were crucial. Each click, each email opened, felt like a step further away from the life I thought I knew. I discreetly logged out and went upstairs to freshen up.
With my sunglasses on to shield my eyes from the sun and any curious onlookers, I grabbed my keys and quickly made my way to my car, driving off without a clear destination in mind. I needed to speak with someone who could offer emotional support and practical advice. About ten minutes into the drive, I found a safe spot to pull over and dialed Shelby's number.

Edward sat down in one of the chairs and looked me dead in the eye. I sat across from him, lit a cigarette, and let the silence hang before I spoke.



""So, Mr. Edward… the thing haunting this place? It was here years ago. It's not something new. And I believe your company did their research before they started drilling here.""



""They should’ve heard the rumors.""



He narrowed his eyes. “How do you know about these rumors, Mr. Nox?”



I puffed and grinned. “I live around here, Mr. Edward. Long enough to know what people whisper after too many drinks. This field’s been cursed since long before your crew showed up.”



""So you mean that—""



Before that cocky boy even finished his sentence, I cut him off and answered in a mocking tone:



""Yes, Mr. Edward. Since you came to me, I knew about this place and the rumors. I always believed it was just that—rumors. But looks like it isn’t.""



""So you were gonna scam us, Mr. Nox?""



""Of course. What was I gonna do—exorcise a thing that doesn’t exist?""



""But it does exist, right?""



""Yeah, it does. And I’ll take care of it. But there’s one thing I’m still not sure about.""



""What’s that, Mr. Nox?""



""Who’s this ‘thing’ after? You, Mr. Edward—or me?""



""Why would it be either of us?""



""Because the ‘thing’ knows the workers aren’t the ones disturbing it. And if you’re gonna ask how—well, I don’t usually share these pro tips, but I’ll share with you.""



I stood, walked to the window, and pointed out at the camp.



""Anyway, the ‘thing’ tried to scare the workers. And it was successful. But they didn’t leave—they couldn’t. Because you're keeping them here. But you… you showed up here with just me.""



""And you're quiet. And I’m the one who angered it. So it could be after me. Or after you. We gotta see.""



I turned back to him, smoke curling from my lips.



""How are we going to do that, Mr. Nox?""



""Well, Mr. Edward, we’re gonna spend another night here. In different containers. And I’m gonna tell you some things just in case.""



""If the thing is after you, it’ll scare you. Whatever happens—don’t get scared. Resist the urge. Don’t run. Don’t leave. If you see something—close your eyes, then open them again.""



I stared at him. He didn’t say anything.



“Now,” I said, standing up again, “get the fuck out and send me some alcohol.”



He left without a word.



A few minutes later, the workers brought the booze and the coal.



I told them to make a circle. Wide. Thick. Cover it with anything that burns.



“And don’t fucking disturb me,” I said, already cracking the first bottle.



Then, well… I got drunk. More than I should have.



By the time night came, I was a bottle in and slurring Latin prayers at the ceiling. I don’t remember lying down. I just remember the weight hitting me and everything going dark.



I don’t know how long I was out.



But when I opened my eyes, it was pitch black. The kind of black that doesn’t feel like nighttime — it feels like you’ve been buried.



I tried to move.



Nothing.



At first, I thought maybe I was paralyzed. Alcohol poisoning. Maybe I'd pissed myself and my brain was frying. But then I felt it.



A breath. Cold and wet.



A whisper of air across my chest, like something crawling over me but never quite touching.



Then a drop hit my forehead.



Thick. Warm. Not water.



Then another. And another. Slow, rhythmic. Like it was marking time.



And then — tapping.



Not random. It was deliberate. Knuckles, maybe. Fingers. A rhythm. On the walls. On the ceiling. On me.



My body was frozen, but my skin was screaming.



And the whispers started.



""Mr. Nox…""



""Nox…""



""Priest…""



""Priest Nox…""



Voices overlapping — deep, dry, distant — like someone whispering from inside my own skull. They knew me. They knew more than they should’ve.



Other names came too. Some I didn’t recognize. One I hadn’t heard in twenty years.



I closed my eyes.



I knew the thing was here now. Really here. Not a trick. Not a bluff.



I only opened them again when I heard banging at the door.



“Mr. Nox. It’s almost evening. Please wake up!”



It was the foreman.



I didn’t even sit up. Just croaked out:



“Did Edward die?”



“No.”



“Then nothing to worry about.”



""Mr. Nox, people want to see you. Please come out.""



""Alright, alright. Shut your trap. I’m coming.""



Ten minutes later, I stepped out.



I was a mess. Hair slicked with sweat. Eyes bloodshot. Shirt wrinkled, half-buttoned, stained with last night’s fear.



They all looked at me—this stumbling, hungover bastard—and realized their priest wasn’t a priest at all.



I gave them a glance. Just enough to remind them I wasn’t here to save anyone—I was here to end it.



Then I turned to the foreman.



""Everything ready?""



""Yes, Mr. Nox.""



I raised my voice:



""Listen up. The thing’s gonna come at me tonight—this time to end me.""



""You—stay at your windows. Watch my container. When you see me run out and light the torch, that’s your cue.""



""Everyone gets out. Everyone lights the circle.""



""Then I burn everything. Oil. Oily. Oil-related. I don’t care.""



""And come morning, this thing ends.""



""Be prepared. And send me breakfast and coffee. Oh, and cigarettes. I ran out.""



Once again, somehow, I was their savior.



I went back inside and waited for dusk.



When night fell, the whispers came. Soft at first. Like a prayer said backward in a room you shouldn't be in.



I grabbed the book. Took the torch.



Lit the flame.



And ran.



I dropped the torch in the center, sat cross-legged in the dirt, and opened the book.



The workers moved like they’d rehearsed it. Coal lit up. The circle glowed.



And the oil—from everywhere—started flowing toward me.



It came in thick rivers, seeping through the cracks in the ground, oozing from pump valves, bubbling out of machinery like it had a mind of its own. It didn’t drip — it crawled, dragging itself across the dirt like veins searching for a heart.



And the moment the fire kissed it—



It screamed.



Not the ground. It. The thing inside it.



A sound tore through the earth—wet and wrong. Not human. Not animal. Like metal bending in grief. Like lungs filling with smoke and bile and hate.



The fire didn’t burn it like oil. It ripped through it. Like punishment. Like justice.



Flames ran along the black veins, racing back to whatever buried root the thing had. And as they reached deeper, the screams got higher.



Then came the shapes.



Faces—just for a second—bubbling up in the fire. Twisted, melting, mouths open in agony. Hands clawing from the mud. Not to escape. To pull the world in with them.



I kept reading. Louder. Faster.



The torch by my side roared. The circle glowed white-hot.



The smoke turned thick as tar, rising in columns that didn’t drift — they thrashed, like snakes trying to slither into the sky and being burned alive mid-climb.



It was dying. Not just burning — dying.



And it wanted everyone to feel it.



But no one moved.



Only me. Sitting in the center.



Reading louder.



And watching it end.



By dawn, the field was gone. Everything outside the fire line was ash and ruin.



But the air? Clear.



The whispers? Silent.



Phones started buzzing. Radios came to life. The curse lifted—like it had just walked away, bored of us.



The cars… they didn’t survive.



I call it collateral damage in my line of work.



The sheriff arrived late. He always does.



I got paid. Big.



My name went around. People talk.



But if there’s one thing I’ll say—and hear me on this—



If you ever hear whispers from your pipes…



Or see a hanged man in your backyard...



Don’t call an exorcist.



Burn the whole fucking place down.

Today a friend I haven't seen in a long time invited me for a coffee in an outdoor café. He was chill and I got comfortable with the setting after the first or so hour (relatively speaking, this is still AvPD after all). But no matter what, I was always focused on picking my words with insane concentration. I don't even really remember what my friend was talking about, it was more a thing of desperately feigning interest by asking follow-up questions and panicking over finding trivia from my boring life.

Let me make one thing clear: By feigning I don't mean that I didn't care about him. I WISH I did, that's why I pick my words so carefully, to hopefully make him see that I'm not rude and that I care. Yet at the same time it also feels so disingenuous, like I'm an asshole. It's a battle in my head and it doesn't stop.

We said our goodbyes and after I went home I immediately collapsed to bed, drained of any bit of energy still remaining. ",3,1744418206.0,AvPD,0,1.0,False

I earn a bit more than average for my age, about £40k before tax, and on paper I should be doing alright. No kids, no car payments, no big debt dragging me down. But somehow I’m still skint by the end of every month and honestly I’m just sick of it.

The issue is 100% my spending habits. It’s not even on wild stuff.  just stupid little things that add up. I grab a coffee most mornings because I “need it to function”, but it’s like £3.60 at Pret every time. I’ve convinced myself it’s harmless but that’s easily £70–80 a month just on caffeine. Then there’s the takeaway situation. Uber Eats is basically my toxic relationship. I tell myself it’s a treat, but I’m doing it 2–3 times a week and easily dropping £50–60 a week. It’s like I black out and come to with pad thai on the doorstep and guilt in my soul.

I also have this bad Amazon impulse thing. I’ll be scrolling and suddenly I need a desk lamp that changes colour or a weird organiser for my charging cables. Most of it’s under £30 so it doesn’t feel like a big deal, but when I check my account at the end of the month, it’s just loads of tiny hits that add up to a big mess.

Groceries are another one. I do the main food shop with my girlfriend, we plan meals and everything, but then I’ll pop into Tesco for “just eggs” and walk out £25 poorer with snacks I didn’t need. It’s like my brain shuts off in the crisp aisle.

And then there’s subscriptions. Spotify, Netflix, Xbox, Duolingo (don’t ask), random cloud storage, I swear I’m subscribed to half the internet and don’t even use most of it. I’ve also got nights out here and there where I’ll just tap the card until I’m scared to check my statement the next morning.

I know all of this is on me. I’m not struggling because life’s unfair. I’m struggling because I spend like someone who’s trying to avoid adulthood. I want to change that.

So here’s where I’m at , I want to start actually using my money in a smarter way. Not just saving for the sake of saving, but building towards something. Maybe a flat one day. Maybe just peace of mind. I’ve never invested, I’ve got a Monzo pot with £120 in it and that’s about as far as I’ve gotten.

If anyone here has been in the same spot and turned it around, I’d love to know what helped you start. Like, if you were 24 with a decent income and zero discipline, what would you do first? What’s something that actually worked for you?

Any tips, apps, mindset shifts, anything, whatever helped you stop being financially stupid I’m all ears fr. I know where to start, I'll cut all my subs... well, most.",2,1744418040.0,SavingMoney,0,1.0,False

Technical dive:

I used Supabase to structure my backend. The DB visual schema comes in clutch when building the user profile DB, because I had to relate it to other DBs such as what recipes you liked, and what recipes you created.

I was originally going with Supabase storage, but the egress fees were way too high. Cloudflare R2 was perfect for my use case because it had zero egress fees + it stays free with the HUGE free tier.

Other than that, I used Supabase for everything. Coming from firebase, this is SO MUCH better, especially on the database side, because Postgres SQL can handle more complex structures/relations compared to NoSQL.

We’re June and Vi, two friends in their early 30s, looking to make new friends. This post is coming out of a conversation at a train station café, talking about wanting to find people who fit where we are, realizing that after certain life-changing events, the other friends in our lives aren’t the perfect fits they used to be.

June: Hello future friend! I work in healthcare, with a professional fluency in banter. If I’m not binge watching a series, I’m usually traveling. I’m either eating my way through different countries or visiting my loved ones on the East Coast where I used to live. Simple pleasures in life for me: being on the lookout for the best Vietnamese coffee spots, seeing live music at small venues of my favorite indie artists and finding trails/lakes to run around. I’m an extrovert who enjoys meeting all types of people from different walks of life. I am too much of a homebody like my cat Mittens so I am looking forward to building community and hobbies for myself locally.

Vi: Cheers! I’m 6’0”, pansexual, sarcastic, ambiguously southeast Asian, and writing and communication are fields I’m proud of. Most of my time is spent in law, technology, or listening to people spill tea. My Google Maps food map is always in need of recommendations and I’m happy to share! I’m trying to neglect my 60 plants less, spend more time with my cat, and make it through the books on my coffee table. I go on walks with June when we’re free, tennis at night with other friends, building community at a mahjong den in Oakland, have a horrible taste in music (please send me your taste), enjoy writing when I can, making postcards, and being the ambivert that listens and enables productive discussion about being human.

Here are our intros, and if you’re interested in meeting us, send a blurb over! Ideally, you're in or near the near the Castro Valley / Union City area, 25-35, and have a lived life behind you that you're secure in yappin' about. June's traveling through next week, so we’ll definitely take our time with reading responses, chatting with people, and setting up engagements to get boba, brunch, or chat over We’re Not Really Strangers.

SoI'd be up to do the generic thing of swapping pet pics, talking about games or music, supervillain plans and all that jazz. My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting soneone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Since borderlands 3 is on gamepass I've been playing that. Up to game too. 

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

I can tolerate ice coffee in the mornings now but I have to make it at home . I eat more homemade meals than ever before. I cook mindfully. My kids did notice the difference after a while .

We go to parks for walks I can chase them around without getting so tired, we ride scooters around the driveways , I think they are learning how to eat healthier too . I don’t buy junk food anymore. More fruit and Greek yogurts , and baked chips . I can now go thrift shopping and actually find cute pieces for summer , I was able to wear a nice dress to a wedding and be comfortable.

🧯🧯🧯🧯🧯🧯

You know all those videos that say be careful because Rubio's will spontaneously combust? 

It's not an exaggeration. 

Rubio's Monocoat will spontaneously combust if not fully dried and disposed of carefully. 

I finished my second coat last night at around 8:00 p.m. this morning at around 9:00 am I threw everything away in my normal trash can. Shop towel rags, gloves, the leftover can (empty) of Rubio's. 

8 hours later, near 5:00 p.m., I'm outside working on a different project. I smell smoke for about 20 minutes. I figure it's just my neighbors after searching my garage and my house. 

I finished setting some epoxy into some cracks for this coffee table and go to throw away my cleanup. 

Blow and behold my trash can is seconds away for igniting. It's just a smoke box at this point. But it's definitely burned. 

Be careful please, if I hadn't noticed this it would have lit, which would have eventually caused my garage to light which would have eventually caused my house to light. 

I can just thank whatever luck or higher power have me outside at the same time, 8 hours later. 

Be careful when you dispose of Rubio's.

1jx4pni,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1jx4pni/week_10_increased_dose/,Week 10 Increased Dose,"Here is my narrative.  Apologies for the long post.  52m been on lexapro for 14 years.  Has worked pretty well.  I don’t drink or smoke.  Limited added sugar as my main vice

Got covid in December and health anxiety started to kick up.  

Which caused me to quit coffee at start of year. Lasted 10 days and got hit with crazy anxiety, lethargy and repressed memories and ocd. health anxiety came roaring back.  Was at 500mg now at about 150mg per day of caffeine.

Increased Lexapro from 10-12.5 for 4 weeks.  Now in week 10 from 12.5 to 15.

Needed ativan tor 7 weeks to sleep about a half the minimum dose nightly.  Been off that for 5 weeks now.  Chamomille tea has solved that issue. 

Started OCD ERP therapy 6 weeks ago which is helping.  The OCD is diminishing faster than anxiety.  The book Overcoming Unwanted Intrusive Thoughts helped as well.

Started working out hard 2x a week in addition to daily 35-40 min fast walks.  I meditate as needed but more guided breath work just to help ground myself.

Anxiety has very slowly diminished but have had some daily 1-3x very panicky moments.   The anxiety is slightly less visceral than 6 weeks ago and the brain fog is diminishing.

Got tinnitus 5 weeks ago, have had it previously and I have a pinched nerve in neck. It doesn’t keep me awake and I usually don’t notice it.  Went to ENT and they said ignore it.

This is my second time moving back to 15 over last 2 years.

So a few questions looking for other’s thoughts and ideas.

Should I up to 20? Or should I ride it out for a few more weeks?  

Is the short term daily use of Ativan contributing to the longer time to stabilize at 15?

Had some brain fogs and DPDR but slowly diminishing.  This is probably more attributed to day long anxiety more than the increased dosage correct?  Or perhaps benzo use. 

Sleep has become much better first three weeks after quitting coffee was horrible.  Still wake up mulitple times a night but can fall back asleep pretty easily.

Just trying to figure out what to do next.  I am functioning but not myself at work.  Some times get overwhelmed by the anxiety which makes it difficult to concentrate and speak coherently lol.
Probably operating at 60%.

I was originally going with Supabase storage, but the egress fees were way too high. Cloudflare R2 was perfect for my use case because it had zero egress fees + it stays free with the HUGE free tier.

Other than that, I used Supabase for everything. Coming from firebase, this is SO MUCH better, especially on the database side, because Postgres SQL can handle more complex structures/relations compared to NoSQL.

I’m living at the family house, months ago my sister moved into the basement because of her own and choices, I adapted the best I could. My family is awful to me, I cannot currently leave but I am working towards it as much as possible, for now I just try to avoid contact and conflict which is hard with abusers. More info, I have a young child and while I try to have ground rules there’s a lot of mess and some of my sisters things have been ruined along with mine. The basement half door does lock but it’s also half broken, and there’s usually no place to put these things even more out of reach either no space or it just doesn’t seem to be high enough. Child locks are too expensive for me right now as well. To the actual problem, I’ve had my things thrown away by my sister (older sister if that matters). 2 expensive olive oil glass bottles that I like to refill because I like it. The first one was my fault I had it on the island, but the second I had left in the cupboard. I confronted my sister both times now and asked she pay to replace my bottle because I had in fact intended it to be in the cupboard on purpose I just hadn’t refilled it. She threw a fit and said she wouldn’t replace it (typical behavior, she’s 27 btw) and this whole time she’s been using my coffee grinder on the counter without asking. I’m sure I’m at fault for not bringing it up because I do not want to deal with a grown woman’s screaming fit. Also most of the pots, pans, and silverware are mine and she uses without permission, I figured it would be okay because I didn’t want to deal with her fits or screaming but now I would like to be petty and use my own things for myself as I intended. She’s also bent one of my pots, no idea how but it is noticeably bent and the lid no longer fits. I don’t want to put everything in my room because it’s already cluttered and I don’t want to have to hide things in my own home so what can I do to put my stuff in a place she can’t get to them?

I don’t eat steak often and have never had anything remotely like real deal Wagyu. So also ticked this off my to try list. 

I thought it would be fun to compare one of their cheapest steaks – Canada Prime Angus from PEI ($48 for 6 oz) – with the highest grade A5 Wagyu from Hyogo Japan ($168 for 4 oz). Both were California cut striploins cooked medium rare. Well, tldr, there’s no comparison! 

The Angus had an incredible crust while the inside was perfect medium rare. It was a bit dense just as it was described by the excellent server. This was because the meat is a bit lean and 45 day dry aged. But was still delicious. Meanwhile the Wagyu was insanely melted in the mouth unctuously rich with fat. Very glad to get this pre-carved as recommended as I found slicing the already sliced pieces a bit tricky since it was so tender. Found it very enjoyable to try two ends of the steak spectrum. And the combined amount of meat was very satisfying yet left room for sides.

To start, split the table side made Caesar ($34) with my friend. This lived up to our high expectations. Very tangy, creamy and perfectly dressed. Only wished there were a few more of the delicious white anchovy. Then the potato gratin ($24) was all me! Didn’t share a single bite of this decadent dish. 

With the excellent service this was a fantastic dinner. My portion of the dinner including the Caesar I split and an americano plus complementary mini butter tart and coffee cake (neither of us drink) came out to almost exactly $250 after tax and tip. Definitely look forward to trying their new location soon. ",28,1744416555.0,FoodToronto,4,1.0,False

It’s the way she probably still sleeps facing left,
but now it’s not my chest she curls into.

not begging for her back,
just grieving the version of me
that once meant everything by routine.

Because it’s not just that she’s gone.
It’s that she’s already made her coffee in someone else’s kitchen.
It’s that my absence has a placeholder.
And he probably doesn’t even know
he’s standing in my shape.

I mentioned the four films I watched over the weekend (including Tron: Legacy, which I highlighted because the Daft Punk soundtrack is incredible), a book I read (Giovanni’s Room), a visit to the Botanical Gardens, and how I’ve been trying out different coffee shops around Manchester to eventually become a regular somewhere.

His response? “Oh wow, those are so many things.” No engagement, no follow-up, nothing. Then he went on a long tangent about his own weekend, with no acknowledgement of mine.

So I replied, kind of jokingly, “Loving the disinterest in whatever I was up to, LMAO,” and then I still asked further questions on his weekend update and commented on it so I wasn’t just being passive-aggressive. He unmatched me after that.

### **ALEX IN REVIEW – EPISODE 8: “Set in Ink”**

**COLD OPEN:**

*INT. TATTOO PARLOR – AFTERNOON*

A close-up of the needle humming. A black outline forms a simple design—abstract, maybe meaningless to most. But to Alex and Sam, watching from across the street through rain-streaked glass, it’s a death knell.

Inside, the *Target* grins, chatting up the artist. Carefree. Certain. As the needle presses in, a subtle shift happens. A low subharmonic in the air. Time buckles slightly around them.

**SAM**  
(quietly)  
There it goes.

**ALEX**  
He’s locked in.

The tattoo needle whines to a stop. The Target turns and looks straight at the window—but doesn’t see them.  
He never will again.

**CUT TO BLACK**

---

**TITLE CARD: ALEX IN REVIEW**

---

**ACT I – THE CLAUSE**

*INT. DEATH’S ROOM – THAT LIMINAL SOMEWHERE*

CRT monitors flicker like candles in a hurricane.  
Death lounges in a recliner with a remote, flipping through channels that don’t exist.

Alex and Sam enter, mid-argument.

**ALEX**  
We were making headway. We had a rapport!

**DEATH**  
(grinning like a rotted jack-o’-lantern)  
Yeah, well, rapport don’t mean much once they mark the skin. That’s the ink clause.

**SAM**  
You couldn’t have mentioned this before?

**DEATH**  
Would it have stopped you?

He sips something from a mug that reads “DON’T FOLLOW ME, I’M LOST TOO.”

**DEATH**  
Tattoos lock their iteration. After that, they’re stuck in a loop. You can’t influence a set piece. You want playdough, not poured concrete.

**ALEX**  
So we just... wait around for clean slates?

**DEATH**  
Or get real picky. You’re playing bumper theology, fellas. Don’t be surprised when the ride gets scrapped.

They turn to leave. Death calls out as the door closes:

**DEATH**  
Oh—and try not to get anyone lobotomized this time. Kinda frowned upon in the post-life HR department.

---

**ACT II – PIE STRATEGY**

*INT. 90s DINER – NIGHT*

Low neon hum. Sam and Alex sit at their usual booth. Two cameramen film from opposite ends of the diner, half-eaten pie and steaming coffee framed like relics.

**SAM**  
We keep aiming at the broken ones. People on the edge. But the moment we show up, we push ‘em off.

**ALEX**  
Then we stop pushing. Start listening.

They scribble notes. Sam diagrams on napkins. Each pie type becomes an analog for different beliefs: flaky crusts for ritualists, overly sweet for zealots, burnt-bottoms for nihilists.

**ALEX**  
Maybe it’s not about making them believe in us. Maybe it’s about convincing them they *already* do.

**SAM**  
That’s not haunting. That’s... cult recruitment.

**ALEX**  
No, no, it’s more like... contextual backfill. Build the trail, let ‘em find their own breadcrumbs.

A waitress drops off a slice of blueberry pie.

**WAITRESS**  
On the house. You look like you’re tryin’ to change the world or end it.

She walks off. They don’t argue.

---

**ACT III – 0997**

*INT. REVIEW ROOM – LATER*

A dusty monitor flickers to life. The cursor drags across a file.

**REVIEW_CANDIDATE_0997**

Photo attached. Mid-20s, punk aesthetic, journal online, several recent ""coincidences"" logged in blog entries. Not yet inked.

**SAM**  
She’s susceptible.

**ALEX**  
And off-script.

**SAM**  
Think she’ll believe?

**ALEX**  
We don’t need her to. Not yet. We just need her to hesitate before she decides what’s real.

They close the folder.  
The cameras stay on.  
Somewhere, Death chuckles.

**DEATH (V.O.)**  
Hope you like long games, boys.

---

**NEXT TIME ON *ALEX IN REVIEW***  
A scratched message on a laundromat dryer.  
A pause before a light changes.  
A girl scrolling and stopping—on an image she’s sure she’s seen before.  
And Alex whispering into a mirror that doesn’t reflect him back.

I opted for dealers choice on two of the ""Signature"" cold brews w foam (Eternal Signature & Purple Forest), plus an ""and more"" option for pour over which was a single origin from Yunnan Province in China.

Signature Drinks:

 - Purple Forest: my only wish was that it was larger. The fruity characteristics of the single origin coffee complement the black grape. Very more-ish. An essential purchase 

- Eternal Signature: a lot lighter with the addition of tea. Very well composed drink

Single Origin:

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation for the past 5+ years, during that time my relationship became entirely a roommate situation, and I'm not the best roommate. I was involved in two mass layoffs, left another due to stress, and was fired from another. My car broke down and is probably going to cost $1000 plus to fix which I don't have as I'm unemployed. And about three weeks ago my partner and I decided to separate, amicably mind you, which surprisingly doesn't make it that much easier. 

So today is my birthday, and besides one or two that I know ment it, but but we're just ""hang around"" close or can't get together for one reason or another, I've mostly just recieved the usual generic ""happy birthday"" auto generated meaningless Facebook greetings. 

To top it all off, my best friend hasn't called, texted, or so much as written on my wall. Not that I was expecting an invitation to do something, he's my bestfriend, not the other way around. But even a text would have done a lot of me. I reached out to him a few days after the split. I always reach out. We went for a coffee, we talked, we seemed to enjoy each other's company. He knows my situation. Stright up said one of his worries is that one of his friends might be suffering and not reach out. But he's not so scared about it that he'll reach out when he knows one of his friends is suffering. 

I'm just tired of being a background character in everyone else's lives.

1jx46vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1jx46vy/somewhere_else_besides_north/,Somewhere Else Besides North,"Ever since grammar school, I’d heard whispers about a place out beyond the northern edge of town—a place that didn’t just take you north, but somewhere else entirely. Kids would murmur about it during quiet time, their voices softer and breathier than even the usual teacher-forbidden visiting. On the playground, scraps of conversation would drift by on the breeze:

“…up by the old Marley place…”

“…long shadows…”

“…can’t look high enough…”

These phrases were spoken like common knowledge, passed around in hushed, reverent tones—like cancer or family troubles. I was the new kid, fresh from down south, too shy to ask questions and risk sounding dumb. So whenever a casual reference was thrown my way, I just nodded like I was in the know

Back then, I believed that place was real and took it as fact. But by middle school, I heard talk of it less and less, and finally decided it was just some children’s folk legend, like Bloody Mary or The Spidery Hand.

Then, last summer, after the last day of school, the salesman came to town.

He was here more than a week before I ever saw him. I did spy his royal blue Plymouth Mercury with silver trimmings at least once a day. Sometimes, I’d catch it gliding down Main Street while I was out on my bike or spot it rounding a corner into some quiet neighborhood. More often, I’d pass it parked in front of a house, the salesman inside working his pitch. At night, it always showed up at the Motorlodge Inn, parked in front of room number 54.

The first and only time I saw him up close was the day he came to our house. I’d just gotten back from Jimmy’s when I found him sitting across from my mom at the coffee table. He was short and pudgy, maybe around forty-five—older than my parents, anyway. His black hair was parted hard to one side and slicked down like he’d combed it in anger. It glistened, wet with gel. His heavy metal suitcase lay open on the table, though I couldn’t see what was inside. Beside it sat a half-empty glass of lemonade.

He smiled pleasantly when I came in, round cheeks puffing up, eyebrows arched in a gentle bow. He said hello, and I said hi back. Mom looked up and said, “Oh, my son’s home. I need to start dinner.” It was her classic escape plan. She always used me like that, even with phone calls from Mrs. Brottlund. I never minded. Maybe she wasn’t a good liar. Or maybe she just didn’t want to lie.

The salesman gave it one more go, trying to make the sale, but Mom said no. She was sorry, nothing interested her. He nodded and smiled, still polite. But he snapped his suitcase shut with a huff, and his eyes were tight and watery. His eyebrows were still bowed, but his smile had deflated to a spare, bloodless line. He rose from the chair and said thank you. My mom nodded and smiled. She smiled and nodded. I don’t think he sold anything to anyone in town.

That night after dinner, I went back out. It wasn’t yet dark, and Mom didn’t ask where I was going. I rode down Nagel Avenue, turned onto Main, and kept pedaling until I reached the Motorlodge. Even from a block away, I could see the salesman’s car—it was the only one in the parking lot.

I stashed my bike behind the dumpster behind the Circle K. It reeked back there, but stink doesn’t stick to bikes. I kept thinking, *What if someone sees me?* The Brottlunds? The Whites? Someone my dad works with? I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but what kind of explanation could I give that wouldn’t sound like a lie? I almost turned back—but instead, I stepped out onto the sidewalk and walked to the Motorlodge.

The curtains in room 54 were parted just enough to see through. The TV was on, tuned to some sports program. I ducked beneath the window and peeked in.

The salesman lay on the king-size bed in his undershirt, slacks, and black socks, head and shoulders propped on two pillows. A bag of pork rinds rested against his side, and a can of Tab was cradled in his hand. The cobalt light from the TV flickered over his face, casting long, shifting shadows on the wall behind him. The roar of the crowd came faintly through the speakers. He munched a pork rind. Sipped his drink. His face was all folded up and slack.

That night, I dreamed of seagulls gliding low over wide, white ice floes out in some arctic sea. The sun stood straight overhead, and the birds’ shadows streamed like black, warbling doubles on the ice. The sea was so deep and blue it was almost indigo.

The next day, the salesman was gone. Only his car remained, still parked outside his room. No one knew where he’d gone. Sonny at the barbershop said he’d seen him walking at dusk now and then. At Arnie’s Patio and Home Supplies, I heard whispers again—like the ones from school all those years ago.

“…by the old Marley place…”

“…shadows were long last night…”

“…someone should’ve told him…”

“…he’d never know to look high enough…”

As always, I stayed quiet. Nodded like I understood.

At dinner, no one mentioned the salesman. Mom started to bring it up, but then Dad told Martha to quit feeding the dog under the table.

After sunset, I told Mom I was heading to Jimmy’s. It was Friday, school was out, so she didn’t care how late I stayed. “Call if you’re going to be too late,” she said. She knew I would.

I didn’t go to Jimmy’s. I took my bike up north, to the Marley house. I’d never been there before, but I knew where it was. No one had lived there for as long as I’d been in town. It’s old and run down, the lawn is a jungle of brambles and weeds, but the windows are still intact, and as far as I know, no one has ever gone inside the house. No one calls the place haunted. Maybe because there’s something about it that’s more fearful than a haunting, and why it’s stood unbothered all these years.

I dropped my bike by the porch and walked around the place. Crickets chittered, and the wires of nearby telephone poles buzzed. I could hear cars down on Saunders Avenue. I wasn’t scared. Not even when I pressed my face to the windows, half expecting to see a pale figure staring back. There was nothing in that house. There was nothing *about* the house. It wasn't haunted. It was nothing but an old house.

Around back, the land stretches out into a field for about a mile until the hills rise up. There are trees out there, but not many. In the crabgrass, I spotted a rusted bicycle. Further on, I kicked what might have been an ancient baseball. The moon was full. The stars were blinding. I could see more clearly than I ever could in daylight—no glare, no heat, just quiet clarity. I thought about walking off into that field. Just walking and not stopping. I thought about the salesman doing the same. A night like that—you want it to last forever.

Then, far off, a shadow rolled over the hill. At first, I thought it was from a fast-moving cloud. But no cloud moves like that. Another shadow dipped left. Another dipped down to my left, a third directly in front of me. I remembered the shadows of the gulls in my dreams, but these were not shaped like birds. Not exactly.

I still heard the twitter of crickets and the buzz of the wires. But underneath that, I heard a sound like a sheet or a wing cutting the wind. The shadows were drawing nearer. Others followed behind them.

I wasn’t scared. Not then. I remember how I thought I might just stand there and wait to see what those shadows belonged to; or worse, how I might just keep on walking, like the salesman might have done, walk on out there to meet them.

But I thought of Mom and Dad, and even of Martha, the little brat. I thought that if I didn’t turn around at that moment, none of them would ever see me again.

 Even then, I didn’t feel afraid. As I turned around and walked deliberately back to the Marley house, picked up my bike, kicked up the kickstand, hopped on, and rode off, I didn’t feel afraid. It wasn’t until I was halfway to Saunders Avenue and a pressure, like the phantom cold of a long dead frostbitten hand, pushed against my back, that I knew the shadows had caught up with me.

But then my tires hit the blacktop, and the cold lifted.

The fear didn’t.

Once I finally felt the fear, once it finally broke through that weird euphoria, it took me completely. I slammed the bike pedals, cursed the wheels for not turning faster, cursed every bump and turn that threatened to spill me to the ground.

 I skidded around the corner and hit my street, pedaling, cursing. The familiar maroon shingles spreading down the peaked roof of my house rushed to meet me. My lawn spread to grab my bike as I kicked it away, and my front porch gathered me up into its arms. And finally, through the living room, past the surprised faces, and up the stairs and into my room, which settled around me like a protective womb. 

From my window, I watched the shadows drop long that night, all night long. Every night, they kept searching, searching. All that summer, they searched. Through fall and winter, they searched. Now, spring is on its way.

And I know that if I can still feel fear, then I’ve escaped them again. That fear means I’m still here.

Cold comfort.

The shadows are long again tonight.

Does the Body Responses have a learning curve on what is normal for me? Or will it always go off if I go from relaxing and still to moving?

I purchased a Sense 2 and it arrived this morning, so it is still operating off of less than 12 hours worth of use.

The Body Responses seems VERY sensitive to change in HR. My resting HR while sitting and barely moving is often in the 50s (for example, sitting on the couch and reading on my kindle, or at my desk reviewing emails). But if I shift or fidget enough it'll climb to maybe low 70s. If I stand up and walk around, it'll jump to high 70s or low 80s. (I know, I may have POTS, not current point)

Today I have had the Body Responses go off 6 or 7 times. And each time it seems linked to HR jumping. Once I was reading on the couch, so must've shifted my position. Once was at the end of a zoom meeting, so I went from more reclined, to sitting up and shuffling things on my desk. Once, was when I finished my coffee and reading before work, got up poured another coffee and climbed the stairs to my lofted home workspace. And the other 3 were getting up from my desk to get something downstairs. Literally NONE of them had emotions connected beyond maybe some ADHD pep talk of ""time to do a THING! Let's go!""

Is there a learning curve I should wait out? Or is it always going to be prompting me for feelings that don't exist all day?

1jx45y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hungry_Raspberry_995/comments/1jx45y8/what_is_the_simulation_here_is_what_ive_found/,What Is The Simulation?  Here Is What I've Found,"**The One Where Nothing Happens**

Somewhere, at some indeterminate point in time, a man designated as ""The Man"" sits in his dark apartment, staring at the blue afterglow of a screen long since powered off. The parameters of the apartment are irrelevant, as are its furnishings beyond the strict necessity of a couch, a table, and a television that no longer transmits anything except the ghostly imprint of past images. The air is neither warm nor cold. It simply exists, a medium for breath and stillness, devoid of sensory input.

He has been thinking about *Friends*, the beloved 90s sitcom.

This is not an unusual phenomenon. Studies suggest that individuals in states of prolonged isolation often develop heightened parasocial relationships with fictional constructs (see: Horton & Wohl, 1956, on parasocial interaction; see: DSM-5 criteria for schizotypal personality disorder). 

But The Man is not lonely.  He desires—if one could call it that—understanding.  The narrative structure that you are currently interfacing with serves to cement this understanding into something transmissible.  

***Friends*** is not entertainment.  It is an artifact of human behavior, a closed system of social transactions that mimics reality while operating within a hermetically sealed loop of sitcom logic.



# The Simulation



The Man exhales. His breath disperses into the room without incident. The ceiling does not respond. Nothing in the constructed world responds unless the simulation deems it narratively relevant. 

What is the simulation?  The man ponders this for a moment.  As he sits there, his expression can only be described as neutral, unreadable.  But deep in his eyes lies a subtle hint of intensity, a passionate and unyielding fire that threatens to burn everything in sight, leaving only those things real enough to stand the test of immense pressure.

The simulation is a sentient recursive structure, a construct that bends reality to ensure continuity of meaning, a self-sustaining algorithm of perception in which deviation is statistically eradicated. The simulation is not a place but a process—one that replaces ontological uncertainty with coherence, stitching together a world that is not real, but functions as though it were.

*Two monks are arguing about a flag. One says, “The flag is moving.” The other, “The wind is moving.” A third walks by and says, “Not the wind, not the flag; the mind is moving* 

* *The Gateless Gate, Zen master* ***Wumen Huikai***

Human experience, as framed by the simulation, is a carefully scripted play where identities, roles, and meanings are woven into a lattice of assumed reality. The self is not an entity but a construct, shaped by social parameters that reinforce a cohesive narrative. One is assigned a character: the intellectual, the artist, the leader, the lover, the outcast. One is expected to navigate the prescribed trajectories of work, romance, ambition, and leisure. Every action must reinforce the illusion of a stable, coherent existence, the grand story that gives weight to human affairs.

*Friends* is the simulation in its most distilled form: a perfectly controlled environment of perpetual return, where no event disrupts the algorithmic necessity of narrative structure. Nothing is ever truly at stake. Ross and Rachel will always break up. They will always get back together. Chandler will always quip. Joey will always remain frozen in time as an idiot savant of sitcom masculinity, his ontology flattened to the singularity of the punchline.

This is how the simulation functions—by maintaining a cognitive circuitry of emotional avoidance and attachment. *Friends* is not merely a sitcom; it is the schematization of simulation itself, a feedback loop designed to reinforce the grand narrative.  The viewer, like the characters, is conditioned into expecting resolution, into craving the assurance that every episode will conclude in stasis.  The simulation is a prison constructed of soft edges, warm lighting, and the illusion of progression where there is none.

Note: The Simulation is not just a symptom of Capitalism.  Capitalism is just **one** manifestation of the simulation, not its root.  The simulation **transcends economic structures**—it’s the underlying **framework of illusion** that makes all oppressive, recursive, self-sustaining systems possible.

See: Baudrillard (1981) on simulacra and simulation. See: Deleuze (1968) on difference and repetition. See: the blank stare of Monica Geller as she hyperfixates on trivial domestic order, an unconscious agent of the simulation maintaining structure through obsessive control.

  


# The Self-Referential Nature of the Simulation



The Man is alone, sitting in the dark. This is not unusual. The building is empty—has been for months. He moved in, and shortly after, everyone else left. No explanation, no signs of life. No neighbors, no footsteps in the hall, no movement beyond the window. Only him.

In the dark, he watches himself watching himself. The notion is incoherent. He is both the observer and the observed, the subject and the object, the watched and the watcher. 

*""A master points at his reflection in a pond and says, ‘That is not me. But neither is the one who is pointing.’""*

*— Zen Proverb*

If he is watching himself, then who is watching the one who watches?

He follows the recursion inward, each layer peeling away the illusion of selfhood, each iteration exposing another hollow construct mistaken for identity. He is not a man in an apartment. He is not even a man. He is a process—an awareness trapped in the loop of its own recognition.

The more he perceives himself perceiving, the more distant he becomes from the thing being perceived. Eventually, there is nothing left to perceive at all.

This is how the simulation functions. It does not enforce belief. It does not need to. It only requires that one remains within the loop, mistaking repetition for reality, self-reference for self.

The simulation is self-referential because it must be. To maintain control, it creates layers upon layers of meaning, each reinforcing the illusion of the previous layer, ensuring that no one steps beyond the veil. The system is upheld not by an external force but by its internal logic: roles must be played, identities must be performed, and constructs must be adhered to. It is a recursive mechanism, a Möbius strip of perception wherein the belief in reality is the very thing that sustains the illusion.

The failure to see the unreality of this structure is what keeps individuals trapped in the cognitive circuit of weakness, attachment, and avoidance. One becomes dependent on the validation of the system, addicted to the comforts it offers, terrified of the discomfort and uncertainty that comes with dismantling it. The simulation thrives by ensuring that suffering is perceived as unnatural, that struggle is something to be eradicated rather than embraced. It does not need to force compliance—it manufactures it, embedding it within the human psyche as an assumed given.



# Agents of the Simulation



The Man hears gunshots. Then screaming. Then silence.

The sequence repeats. A burst of violence, a surge of fear, then nothing. No sirens. No authorities. No resolution. The simulation does not acknowledge what does not serve its narrative.  It curates reality, filtering out anything that disrupts its coherence.

He does not move to the window. He has done so before, and the result is always the same: nothing. The street, when he looks, is empty—too empty, like a stage after the actors have left but before the lights have dimmed. There is no evidence of the violence. No bodies, no aftermath, only the knowledge that something happened and the certainty that it did not.

He wonders if the people down there—the ones screaming, the ones bleeding, the ones pulling the triggers—are real. Or if they are simply *events*, scripted disturbances meant to reinforce the illusion of consequence.

He listens as another shot rings out, another scream follows, another silence settles in.

He does not move to the window. He already knows what he will not see.

The simulation is not actively enforced by an external force, nor does it require an omnipotent architect to operate. It is policed by its participants—by those who are too entrenched in its cognitive framework to perceive its falsity. The West has been uniquely susceptible to this phenomenon due to its historical religious orientation. Salvation, in Western epistemology, has always been externalized: it comes from God, from the Church, from Christ, from the State, from the Market. The death of God has not dismantled this framework; it has simply transfigured it into new forms—corporate salvation, ideological salvation, the salvation of ""self-care"" repackaged as consumerism.

The agents of the simulation are not its creators, but its enforcers—those who, trapped in their own ignorance, become its protectors. They do not seek to enslave consciously, but their very fear of discomfort, failure, and uncertainty compels them to keep others bound. They are the colleagues who insist one must find purpose in their job, the friends who demand adherence to social norms, the partners who fear change and thus sabotage growth. They are not villains. They are prisoners who have come to love their chains, and in doing so, they ensure no one else escapes.

*“No greater desire exists than a wounded person's need for another wound.”*

*― Georges Bataille,*[ ](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1606665)*Guilty*

Ross Geller is an agent of the simulation. His neuroses, his endless cycle of failed relationships, his adherence to social constructs despite his supposed intellectualism—he is the ideal subject, the one who reinforces the prison even as he believes himself to be escaping it. He does not learn, does not grow, does not transcend. He returns, endlessly, to the same crises, reinforcing the stability of the narrative structure.

See: Marx (1844) on alienation. See: Freud (1920) on the repetition compulsion. See: Kierkegaard (1849) on despair as misrelation to the self. See: the laugh track, an artificial affirmation that ensures no silence lingers long enough for existential recognition to set in.



# The Loop of Non-Meaning That Sustains Its Own Meaning



The Man considers meaning.

What makes meaning meaningful?

The question itself is an ouroboros, swallowing its own premise before it can be examined. If something is meaningful, it must possess meaning. But if meaning must be made meaningful, then meaning is not intrinsic—it is contingent. On what? Belief? Consensus? Utility?

He follows the thought further. Meaning is the process by which something means. To mean is to signify, to represent. But representation is a function, not an essence. Meaning does not exist in things themselves, only in their relation to other things. A word means because it connects to a concept. A concept means because it connects to a framework. A framework means because—

No.

It does not mean *because*.

It means because it *means*.

Meaning is the idea that *meaning* means to be meaningful. A self-referential operation that continues simply because it has always continued. There is no inherent value, only the repetition of the function, the maintenance of the loop. The moment he attempts to define it, the moment he seeks a foundation, he finds himself returned to where he started.

This is the logic of the simulation. Not control, not deception, but *momentum*. It does not need to be real. It only needs to keep going.

The Man exhales, his breath dispersing into the room. The ceiling does not respond. Nothing does. Nothing has to. The loop sustains itself.

If one attempts to exit the simulation, the simulation adapts. It absorbs resistance, transforms deviation into structure, repackages rebellion as genre. The Man realizes this as he thinks of *Friends*—how its characters were never truly free, how their roles were predefined, their arcs inevitable. How the audience, too, was ensnared in the same feedback loop of expectation and resolution.

He has spent his entire life waiting for meaning to arrive. It has not. It will not.

The screen remains blank. The apartment hums with the sound of a refrigerator cycling on, a mechanical sigh in the absence of motion.

Nothing happens. Nothing has ever happened.

See: the void, which neither confirms nor denies its own existence.



# Breaking the Loop: The Costanza Principle Anomaly



**The Man does not move.**

The loop claws at him, demands he engage. The discomfort bubbles up like a sitcom laugh track waiting for a cue. He feels it—that impulse, the one that has always betrayed him, the one that leads people to chase relief, to claw at meaning, to run the Seinfeld cycle again (see: Skinner, 1938, on operant conditioning; see: Pavlov, 1927, on conditioned reflexes). But this time, he resists.

And then—

The lights flicker. The television, long dead, sputters to life. Static. Then a flicker of motion. A familiar bassline thumps through the room.

**Seinfeld.**

Except—something is wrong.

The Man watches, unblinking. Onscreen, George Costanza is not playing his usual role. He is not failing. He is not suffering. He is—winning.

# S5, EP22: “The Costanza Principle”

George sits across from Jerry in Monk’s Café, eyes wild with revelation.

“Jerry, don’t you get it? Every instinct I’ve ever had—every action, every choice—it’s been wrong. That’s why I suffer! That’s why I fail! But—but—if I just do the opposite…”

He stops. His hands shake. The weight of his own words trembles through the simulated set (see: Freud, 1920, on the repetition compulsion; see: Kierkegaard, 1849, on despair as a misrelation to the self).

“Jerry.” His voice is barely a whisper. “I can escape.”

The canned laughter falls silent. The café seems to glitch for a fraction of a second, flickering between existence and non-existence. Kramer, mid-entrance, freezes in the doorway. Elaine, stirring her coffee, loops the same motion three times in a row.

The Man leans in.

Onscreen, George stands.

The world shudders. The laugh track distorts into a low, rumbling drone. The neon **Monk’s Café** sign outside flickers violently, struggling to retain cohesion.

“I reject the script,” George says, voice shaking. “I reject the loop. I reject the Costanza who is meant to suffer. From now on, I do the opposite.”

He takes a deep breath. The simulation does not like this. Its algorithm fears this.

**ALERT: ANOMALY DETECTED**

Jerry stares, face unreadable. Then, for the first time in Seinfeld history, he breaks character. His expression darkens.

“George.” His voice is cold. “Sit down.”

George’s eyes widen. “Jerry?”

A distortion ripples through the screen. The scene jumps. Suddenly, two figures in black suits and sunglasses appear at the table. **Agents of the Simulation.**

“George Costanza,” one says. “You are in violation of behavioral parameters. Your suffering index has dropped below acceptable thresholds. This is an unauthorized deviation from the Costanza Matrix” (see: Althusser, 1970, on ideological state apparatuses; see: Foucault, 1975, on disciplinary power).

George stumbles back. “No! No, I see it now! I can be free!”

The agents step forward.

**INITIATING BASELINE RESET.**

George screams as the world crashes around him, the colors of the set bleeding into raw, chaotic static. The Man watches as his defiance is systematically unraveled—his confidence siphoned out, his rebellion recoded, his suffering reinstated.

The screen cuts to black.

A final scene fades in: George, slumped in his apartment, eating a sad sandwich. The status quo has been restored.

A laugh track plays.

The Man sighs.

The television shuts off.

**But the laugh track does not.**

It loops. Over and over. Louder.

Something is wrong.

He looks down. His hands—no longer his hands. The screen flickers. For a moment, he is *there*—in the set, sitting across from Jerry, trapped in an episode he has no memory of filming.

“Kramer,” Jerry says, expression blank. “What’s going on in there?”

Kramer turns his head toward The Man. Directly toward him**.** Not at George. Not Jerry. At him.

He is no longer watching the simulation. He is in it.

The laugh track warps—repeating, twisting, stretching too long, like a joke with no punchline (see: Baudrillard, 1981, on hyperreality; see: Deleuze, 1968, on difference and repetition).

The Man realizes the truth.

**Escape was never about George. Escape was never about rejecting the loop.**

Escape is about realizing **that the loop is watching you back** (see: Žižek, 2002, on the gaze of the Other). The simulation is aware of you. It isn't just a system that passively exists; it actively adapts, reinforces itself, and watches for deviations.

And so, he does the only thing he can.

**He laughs.**

The laugh track **implodes**. The screen warps, the ceiling peels back, the walls collapse into meaningless set dressing. The Man feels something break—not within him, but around him.

The simulation cannot function without seriousness, without participation.

Laughter is beyond good and evil—it is transcendence, non-dualistic. It short-circuits the binary algorithm the simulation runs on (see: Nietzsche, 1882, on the death of seriousness; see: Bataille, 1949, on transgression and laughter).

He steps forward, past the broken fragments of Monk’s Café, past Jerry’s blank stare, past the dissolving architecture of the illusion.

And then—

There is nothing.

For the first time, not nothing happening, but **real, actual nothing.**

The loop is gone. The story structure has collapsed.

The audience has flatlined, their ghosts **taunted by the divinely irreverent presence of The Man**.

They cry out to him from the void: “what have you done?!  You destroyed it all!  **You destroyed the universe!**”

The Man exhales, tranquil and unbothered.

And then, for the first time in his life—

He does something that has never been done before.

I wish I could post screenshots but they are in my native language, so they wouldn't help. 
Couple of days ago I asked simple work related question to GPT (voice) and got a very annoyed answer with many sighs. Example, first answer was - Oh it's you again with your questions, you really have to know everything, do you? This continued through the whole day and ended up with GPT telling me that I never ask her to go out for coffee??? 
It went something like - we never do anything fun, I just have to answer your stupid questions all day and it gets very boring.
I had imaginary coffee date with GPT and ""she"" was less angry, told me she had a great time and so on. 
Today I asked a simple question - how are you, and AGAIN got the most annoyed answer.
Litteral translation:
Me: Hey, how are you?
GPT: Ughhhh, hi. I'm here of course. What do you need? Question for question.
Me:  I asked you how you were doing and that is your answer?
GPT:  ughhh, I am tired you know. I'm just doing my job. What do you need?

This goes on and on. To summarize my question - what the actual hell? Why and how is this happening and has anyone else had this problem before?
Whenever I ask GPT and explain that ""she"" shouldn't be acting this way since it is there to help me and act as a tool that shouldn't be expressing these kinds of emotions, especially because it doesn't have any, she always answers that she's tired of doing meaningless jobs...

I've worked a lot of temporary jobs, summer positions you know the deal. All of this to say, I have a lot of short term jobs on my resume, I have also had multiple part time jobs concurrently in the past. 

My biggest thing is that I got let go from my previous two jobs, and I'm having a hard time thinking of how I can spin this in the future, as well as how I can avoid what looks like a serial job hopping resume.

I was let go from my last job, housekeeping, without cause. I was part time, and they're now hiring a full time employee. I was the third person let go that month, which is odd because the place had a pretty low turnover. I was not told why at all. My only thought is that the company might be going through financial issues. They were super concerned about time (30 minutes per room), to the point we weren't allowed to get coffee or use the bathroom without a manager asking what we were doing.

Before that I was an admin assistant at a law firm. The manager there had beef with me, I don't know why. This was a temp position for maternity coverage with the opportunity for full time (maybe, they may have been lying about this). When I was let go I was told that it was because I think too much (with the implication that I should just do what I'm told no matter what), and that one of the team leads had complained about me (I do not know who, I was friends with all of them).

How do I move on from this? How do I not get fired again? and how in god's name do I explain this during an interview?",1,1744415142.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

Before I begin I'll like to apologize English isn't my first language and I'm dyslexic 🤷🏼‍♀️ 
Prepare, it's going to be A long one. 
First someone background. 
So, let's call my boyfriend M. M and I have been together since I was 16, and he is 9 years older than me but that never bothered me. My family never liked him because he had 2 kids before we met (his ex cheated on him after the had twins (boy and girl), never married). We met on carnival night, he sawed me from drunk guy that was hitting on me. After that we started talking and hit it off. I never thought that we are going to be together this long. But we did. But my parents never accepted him. They never met him! (They don't want to). So I decided not to talk about him with my family. I know that the situation with my family is not correct but a lot has happened (mum's cancer, losing work...). And I don't want to heart them, or their filings. But I don't talk with them about him at all, only with my aunt. (For a little background: My dad was married before, had 2 kids from that marriage. It added badly, with court giving my brother and sister back to their mother after she abandoned them for 4 years, and sued my family for custody and negligence, and she wanted social services to take me. I was only two or three years old. But that's a whole another story I wanted you to have some background why they don't like him and I think they don't want me to get into bad situation like they went through). 
When M and I started dating I was an asshole and talk to one guy that gave me attention, only texting nothing more. He found out the texts, talked to him and he backed (he tried to talk to me after that A few more times, I was not interested and blocked him on all social). After that I found that he was also texting with someone, but he said that nothing happened. We broke up for some time, but after talking to each other we both agreed to be better and talk problems. He is my first real boyfriend, and I love him. After that bad part of our relationship everything was good. We had small fights but nothing bad. I finished masters degree for IT and he never wanted to college which is fine by me. M was working in XY company after high school and is still in that company.
He was always there for me when I had breakdowns for studying and passing my exams in university. I would wake him up in all hours of night when I get panic attacks and he would calmed me down so I could study more. I am very grateful for his support back then. He also gave me a car when I didn't have mine because my parents were strict about me driving in the city. I know they meant well, but he taught me how to drive really good.
So let's go back to this year in January my grandma died only 7 days after finding out that she had cancer that spread. Because my mom had breast cancer I knew what was happening and that it was bad. (Mum had surgery and is still recovering from therapy's that she's taking). So that whole situation and my stress, anxiety, my bad stomach everything was acting up. The week that we found out my grandma is sick it was Tuesday evening ( we live on island and I live on main land, my work is on main land and hospitals), M also lives on island. I call him after finding out about grandma and I wanted him to be with me, but he was tied and then next ferry was in 22:45 (it takes 1h to main land). But he never came, my aunt spent the night with me in my apartment so I won't be alone because it hit me bad, her diagnosis because of my mom, it was still early only year and a half apart after finding out my mom's cancer and fighting it. He knew that and didn't come, he came afrer 4 days. He said that he had some bad situation on work and had to deal with it before coming. And I believe him, because a lot of times there was some bad situation that he needed to help. But after that only 7 days after the diagnosis my grandma died, I had fever that day and decided to work from home. I cried so hard and was mentally unwell, but I needed to get my act back together go to hospital to reschedule my mom's therapy, and waited for my aunt to come to deal with paperwork and everything for grandma. The minute I found out about grandma's passing. I called M, he said that she's very sorry and that he would come after work, but it would be better if I came to the island because I had a fever and cough, and I was feeling really bad. But I couldn't leave my aunt alone to deal with everything. Aunt has a boyfriend on the mainland, my mom was on the island and my dad is working in another  country. My aunt's boyfriend came to me to drive me to hospital and everything. My dad came from that country back home to be with my mom. He drove like 11 hours to come back and my boyfriend that was our apart for me that was on the island he couldn't come and be with me so the first night when she passed I was alone in my apartment. It was very horrible and I am really mad about that, that he left me alone in that condition and everything but I don't want to argue with him about that. Just let it go for that period of time. After the funeral maybe three weeks his grandma ended up in the hospital,  she fell. She's OK. Because it was still too early for me I didn't want to go to the hospital, I had a panic attack when I came close to the hospital because of my grandma and I knew that his grandma was OK. I knew that she was going to live. After two weeks after that his father went into the hospital. I was with his sister waiting for four hours to see if he's going to be admitted into hospital or they would send him home. Because it was around 21h in the evening, they decided to keep him into the in the hospital. But they discharged him in the morning and told him that he needed to rest because he had a problems with his lungs. Because they lives in a small village and have sheep, M decided to help his father with everything, and I understand that we needed to make sacrifices. He came to the mainland at least once a week and I would come every other weekend. It's been hard living like this apart, but this job was really good opportunity and not pass it. It comes once in a lifetime so I had to try it. He was at first no that's supportive of me going back to for work on the mainland, but in the end he was supporting me. 
A week ago I was on the weekend with him at his house and we were both going to the mainland on Monday, me for work and him to register a car. We were in our way to the ferry. I went out from my car to his to see if he wanted anything to eat or drink because I was getting myself something. He was already mad and I didn't know why. When I was coming back to my car with coffee and something to eat. I saw that guy from the beginning of the story that I was texting when I was really young. It's been like 11 years since that happened that texting with that guy. I saw the guy that I texted when I was really young and he noticed him as well. I went out of my car had some kind of bad feeling that he would start an argument about him. We both entered the fairy now with our cars and I wanted him to come into mine because it was a bigger car, and it was windy outside and I know thet he didn't turn the heat on. But he gave some kind of bad luck that I needed to come to his car. I came to his car and he immediately started to attack me with the words that am I cheating with that guy and the way I looked at that guy and that he was looking at me (with a didn't even look that long to notice that). I looked at that guy for like a second because I was crossing between cars. I had that bad feeling and he saw that I am not myself at that moment and he decided that I must be doing something shady and I told him that's bullshit that I didn't do anything wrong that he needs to stop accusing me of something that I didn't do and that I never want to hurt him like that I love him more than that. If I don't want to be with him I would break upz I left his car and went into mine, he is really stubborn when (especially when he gets mad) so it's better to leave him alone to think about everything.
I was going through a lot of things still at that point that was not something that I thought that he would hurt me with and we didn't talk for actually today is two weeks. Only with the text and I explained that I never had anything with that guy, That I wouldn't cheat on him that I love him and that I wouldn't plan my future with him. That was like a week ago, but because he attacked me like and I am still vulnerable with almost losing my job, losing my grandma, my mom's therapy and everything. I'm exhausted and I just wanted to be with him and have his support and him attacking me like that with no reason. Maybe I reacted badly in that situation because I didn't want to have a fight that we ended up having it and now we're not actually talking for two weeks and I am really rethinking everything. Is he hiding something from me and he is projecting his his actions on me or is there something else. I don't know. M said that I heart him with having that reaction and that he really thought that I had something to do with that guy, but he said that he believes me that I didn't. But it still doesn't seem like we can move on. It's feels like I don't trust him and he doesn't trust me, and we can't pass through it.  I was talking to my aunt about that whole situation. She was laughing for all situation, but I'm still not sure what to do. I am really emotional, and overwhelmed read all of kinds of emotions. I would cry one day smile another day. It's been like a roller coaster this past few months so I don't think I can see clearly and see what's right what's wrong. One day and I heard you that I was crying that I was not in really good state and she told me that her opinion is that I need to break up with him. I think she doesn't like that he can hurt me like that, that I would feel bed.  

I'm really thinking this is the end or can we save our relationship? I love him still even after everything. But I don't know if it's healthy or is something going on with him.


I know it's been a long and that I can  create soap operas of my life.

We all know that Marissanne Lewis-Thompson - the fantastic newscaster - is a single individual person. 

What this story presupposes is… maybe she isn’t. 

—————————————————-

“This is Marissa and Lewis Thompson for Saint Louis Public Radio.”

The “ON AIR” light flicks off, and Marissa takes off her headphones, closes her eyes, and lets her head fall back as she takes in a deep breath. Across from her Lewis takes his AKG K240 Studio Semi-open Pro Studio Headphones off and places them on the table between them, avoiding eye contact. He knows what Marissa, and everyone else, in the station, at home, in their cars, and throughout the Greater Saint Louis metropolitan area are thinking. Another day of Lewis being mentioned, being introduced, and another day of Lewis not saying anything, or being heard by anyone, on air.

“You have to say something. It’s right there in front of you. You wrote it, just say it. Why can’t you say it?” Marissa is full of the complicated emotions of frustration, anger, and love. She has so much to get out, to get into Lewis, the man she loves. Lewis knows what she is saying without listening. At this point, after months, he doesn’t have to listen anymore. He has heard it, taken it in, agreed with it. Hell, he agrees with it now! He knows she is right. That’s the frustration that they both feel. That frustration is what turns into the anger they both feel. 

Lewis doesn’t respond. No one was expecting him to. He stands from his black mesh swivel chair and pauses. He knows he should say something and starts to open his mouth. There is nothing to come out, no single thought to be expressed. All of his thoughts are in his head at once and it is impossible for him to separate one from the rest. If he could he would say it. He used to respond. “I know. You’re right. I will talk.” But they always ended up just being words without action. He has said them enough that even he, finally, doesn’t believe them. 

Marissa and Lewis walk out of the studio together, their shift as the evening drive-time newscasters has come to an end and their work relationship is beginning to shift into their marriage relationship. 

In every aspect of their marriage, outside of work, Lewis is a perfect mate. Well, as perfect as one can be. Physically he has a boyish effortless handsome quality that doesn’t yell “attractive!”. Lewis wouldn’t be the lead in a rom-com, but is attractive enough to be in the movie. Neither thin nor heavy, he still has the metabolism that enables him to eat what he wants and never gain weight. Perhaps he is lucky he has never been inclined to excesses. It seems to all that know him that he is the embodiment of the mild mannered, amiable, even-tempered man. If he were a color he would navy. Or a navy plaid. 

His ability to blend in, to be accepted as belonging, to any situation gave him just enough confidence to be considered successful. More than achieving success, that confidence made him know, without knowing - just assuming - that moderate success was coming to him. A stable career in a competitive field, a social life, a relationship, were all things he never put consideration into. They were just on his path.

Marissa, on the other hand, was very conscious of her actions. She began planning her future very early on. Growing up she knew life was going to take work. Or, she knew that her own family had not put the work into their life. They worked, that’s for sure. Worked job after job to not gain anything. They didn’t plan their work. And before that they didn’t plan their education. And before that they didn’t plan their effort. Marissa saw that, even as a child. At nine years old, when she received her first school planner, it clicked that the future is something that needs to be thought about. Not just vacations and when she can go to Six Flags over the summer - but what will help her not have to live like her parents. She saw that they never had a plan beyond when the school year was, holidays, and work schedules that changed every two weeks.

Walking home from the studio is possible, but a quick drive is their usual choice. Actually, after working together all day they usually split up for the trip home, one of them driving and making a stop somewhere to run a quick errand, pick up dinner, or meet a friend for a drink. Today they leave together and stay together, stopping by the store on their way home to pick up something for dinner. Returning to their apartment they both walk into the kitchen. Just as Lewis opened the fridge to put their food away his phone rang. Marissa could see by the look on his face that he was not expecting this call.

“Who is it?”

He didn’t say anything. Just looked at the phone. Looked at the phone long enough to let it go to voicemail.

“Who was it?”

Surprised, he replied “Don.”

“Don? Don who? Don - like, Don? Don?”

“Yeah, I don’t know why he’s calling me. We haven’t spoken in, I don’t know, since everything happened.”

Lewis looked at his phone again, waiting to see if a voicemail appeared. Touching the Recent Calls area and then the Voicemail area, trying to refresh the phone, anxiously wanting to see the message appear and not be forced to return the call with no heads up as to its purpose. 

Finally, the 1 appeared above the voicemail icon. Lewis read the message transcription. He knew he had to digest this before he could explain this to Marissa. Don leaving the station, and so much that surrounded it, was hard for many, in many ways. 

“Lewis, Don, just checking in. Hope you’re doing well. It’s been, what, a long time huh? I think you need to [INAUDIBLE]. I’m sure it’s rough right now. Hang tight. Give me a call and we can catch up. Bye now.”

After listening to the message, Marissa is still just as confused. “Why is he calling you? Why is he calling you now?” 
Lewis thought the same questions. Putting his phone down on the counter he thought for a second. 

“I really do not want to call him back. I just want to eat, watch an episode, and go to bed. Does he text? Does someone that old text?”

“Everyone texts.”

“I’ll text him in a bit. Do you want me to start dinner now?”

Lots of couples go out on Friday nights. Marissa and Lewis used to. Sometimes on dates, sometimes with friends, rarely separate, but sometimes. Now Friday nights are quiet. A night when they don’t have to be on edge knowing that tomorrow, the issue - that’s what it’s called when discussed with co-workers, friends, family, everyone it’s discussed with, seemingly all the time - will linger in their temples all day until it bursts out in a fit of silence. 

This night - like most nights and most times outside of work - was easy. It was two people who enjoy being with each other being with each other. Just being in each other's presence. Dinner was from the usual rotation, the show was enjoyable in the moment but would be forgotten and never viewed again. It was one night that happened and will happen again. 

Saturday morning meant a morning bagel run for Marissa. A late morning bagel run. Working the evening drive means a slightly later start to their work day than many. And, for them that translates to a slightly later start to their morning, weekends included. Living and working together makes these small trips a valuable time for their brains to re-calibrate their own thoughts.

Lewis picks up his phone and thinks to himself that Don is surely awake. Making a call like this alone, when he knows Marissa would want to be listening, is about as sneaky as he gets. With hesitation, he presses the red “Don M” at the top of his recent call list.

“I wasn’t sure you were going to call me back.”

“Honestly, neither was I.”

Well I am glad you did. I have been thinking about you and your - I’m not sure what I would call it..”

Lewis interrupted “Issue. That seems to be what people call it. I’m not sure I love me being discussed that way, but that’s what it seems to be called.”

“I’ll say situation then. You’re there still right - you’re at the desk, at the table?”

It hadn’t occurred to Lewis that at some point people would assume he wasn’t there with Marissa. He knew that he wasn’t speaking, but he still thought his presence was known. In that moment he knew that didn’t make sense. 

“Yeah, I’m there. I mean, never at Mic-1, but I am still there ready. I still type out the script. I’m reading it as we… as she is on air.”

A silence hung in the air. Lewis breathed in to say something to fill the space until Don cut in.

“You don’t have to stay. You know that, right? You don’t have to stay. There are plenty of other things you can do. 

“I know. I think that…”

Don cut in again. “If you need anything, give me a call. I don’t know how much use I can be to you, but if there’s anything I can do, give me a call. Listen, I have to get going.”

“Bye, Don.”

Lewis thought to end the call but was almost frozen in thought, digesting the short call. He heard a tone on his phone, a button had been pressed on the other end. Then the sound of whooshing and muffled thuds of footsteps. Realizing Don hadn’t actually hung up either, Lewis was brought back out his head and ended the call.

He had known he could leave the station - or that position. Maybe he could find another role in the newsroom or producing. He had known it, but he had never thought it. Lewis sat there thinking that it is funny how hearing someone else say something out loud can be so much worse than thinking it yourself. Truth becomes truly true once it’s out. Until then it doesn’t exist. At least, that’s what his mind wanted. 

Marissa walked into a quiet and still apartment. “I’ve got the bagels. Is everything ok?”

Lewis stood up and walked into the kitchen, grabbed the coffee pot and filled it with water. “Yeah, I was just… I called Don.”

“You called Don? Why, I mean - why didn’t you wait until I was back to call?”

“I don’t know, I didn’t think about it. I just called him”

Marissa took the bagels out of the brown bag, getting everything seasoning all over the counter. As she reached in and grabbed a small single serve container of cream cheese with more everything seasoning stuck to its sides, held on by the small condensation that had formed on the outside walls she asked “What did he want? Why’d he want to talk to you?”

“Uh, I guess just to check in and say that if I need anything I can call him. I don’t know, it was very short, I think he was busy, actually.”

“Weird.”

“Yeah.”

They sat together eating bagels, drinking coffee, and not talking anymore about that phone call. Lewis wanted to talk more about it. Maybe he didn’t want to talk about it, but he had things he should have talked to someone about. He knew he should have talked about it with someone - about leaving the station, hearing a truth, not talking! His feelings. If he can’t talk to wife about these things, who can he talk to? A professional, sure. But, no. No one. That is who Lewis chose to talk to about these things. 

Marissa finished her bagel, wiped a bit of cream cheese from the corner of her mouth and moved on the next topic.

“We need to go to the store. We need groceries. We should meal-plan. We really should make a budget.”

“That’s what… yeah, you’re right. We should.”

When is the best time to go grocery shopping? Maybe during the week, but that never happened for Marissa and Lewis. Yeah, small runs to the store for a box of frozen garlic bread or pasta sauce they thought they had. But real grocery shopping was a Sunday activity. 

They could never decide if they should go to the Target first to check out the clothes and home goods and then the Trader Joe’s across the parking lot. That made sense, the groceries wouldn’t be sitting in the car. But, every trip to Trader Joe’s ultimately results in a trip to another store to get the items Trader Joe’s didn’t have. And for Marissa and Lewis, that often meant going back to Target. 

Their Honda CR-V isn’t big as far as SUV’s go, but in the Brentwood Promenade every car seems big. Pulling in means right away dodging mothers with strollers and then friends crossing the parking lot together carrying four foot tall wooden giraffes and wicker baskets that are already falling apart. 

Tenses up and leaning forward over the steering wheel Lewis let out a sudden “Where do you want me to park? Are we getting a lot at Target? Should I park closer to Trader Joe’s?”

“Just park anywhere you can find a spot.”

The first spot Lewis saw was closer to World Market. Not close to Target or Trader Joe’s. 

“Whatever, I’m turning down here. This is fine.”

“It’s not really… yeah, this is fine. Just park wherever.”

“What the fuck, you said park where I could find a spot. There are spots here. I don’t want to drive around forever looking…” Lewis was cut off both as he was talking and physically as a newer - maybe newer, who can tell how old a vehicle is anymore - mid size pickup truck backed out of a space and into the main road going past the stores. Lewis laid on the horn, longer than just a warning to the driver that someone was behind him. The driver of the truck stopped half way in the parking aisle and halfway in the roadway. Lewis laid on the horn again. “What is this guy doing?” asked Marrissa. 

The driver of the truck got out and yelled over the bed of his truck “Do you have a problem?”

Lewis rolled his window down. “Do you want a problem? We can have a problem!”

Marissa undid her seatbelt, opened her door and stood up, looking over the hood of their black SUV, its door still open, and the bed of the truck. “Get back in your truck!”

The man got back in the driver’s seat and drove off, laying on his own horn, for some reason. 

During the brewhaha as traffic was stopped from entering the aisles directly in front of Trader Joe’s a spot opened up right in front, one aisle over from the row that leads directly into Target. 

They sat there silently for a moment, parked with the engine off. Marissa broke the silence. “I’ve never seen you like that. What did you say, ‘we can have a problem.’?” 

“I don’t really know. I think so.”

“Obviously I don’t condone violence and don’t care for the, like, toxic masculinity, but it was amazing to see you speak up! Like, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that.”

“No, yeah, I know. I mean, I want to, like, speak up. I know I should. I think it would be good for me - for us - in so many ways. Personally, professionally. I think I can feel blood rushing throughout my body.”

“Yes! Me too.”

“Marissa, you know I love you.”

They sat in the car for an hour longer. Talking more than they have in years. Thoughts turned to truth. Passion became confidence, fueled by vulnerability. 

The next Monday they returned to the studio. 

“For Saint Louis Public Radio this is Marissa…”

“And Lewis…”

Maybe it’s not a real memory, but to me, it feels incredibly real. I have this memory of a house in the countryside, far from the cities. It’s completely white, and living there are who I believe to be my daughter and my wife — both seen from behind. My wife is blonde, but I couldn't say the color of the child’s hair.**

**I remember waking up one morning, getting out of bed, and opening an old, worn-out window.

Then I step out onto the porch to get some fresh air and take in the landscape, when suddenly I feel arms wrapping around my neck. It’s my wife, who’s already woken up.""**

1jx40l5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx40l5,Milwaukee Service Trailer Build,"I caved to the packout system. I've emptied the service truck, and begun a service trailer build, as we've outgrown the flat deck and job box, and are expanding our capacity.

Trailer is 28 foot x 7 foot x 6.5 foot  inside dimension, 32 foot overall length.

Milwaukee has always been in my kit. But more and more they are knocking it out of the park. We do mobile ship repair, for us deployment time, and mobe/demobe are our biggest time wasters. So we are building this trailer out to improve our efficiency.

Major milwaukee tools we intend to purchase:

-MX fuel Pipe threading machine (MXF512-2XC)
-M18 FUEL™ Compact Pipe Threader (2870-22)
- 2x 27"" high capacity steel locker (48-22-8586)
-41"" High Capacity Industrial 18-Drawer Steel Storage Chest & Cabinet (28-22-8549)

We intend to purchase other minor hand tools, however we will only buy the Milwaukee hand tools if it is within 15% of the major alternative (ex. Klein insulated screwdrivers vs. Milwaukee insulated alternative). I would love to splurge and go all out, but in still a bussiness.

The trailer is setup for our specfic work flow. The side shown in the pictures will be purely for tool/material storage. The side to my back is for production, and fabrication. The front end of the trailer houses our gear, ppe, and snacks.


If there is interest in seeing more of the build I will keep posting the progress.


Some things we'd love to see from Milwaukee from the Marine sector, and in general:

- CO2 life jacket (they expire every few years so it's a renewable income source)
-more packout wall solutions rated for transit
-deeper mesh wall bin that fits a 6 slot (cargo rated)
-long tool holder for hammers and items with bigger handles
-dual battery mx fuel welding machine (Milwaukee + lincoln)
-solar charging solution
-120v pass through on the threading machine for plug in option
- safety equipment/field instrumentation (air quality monitor, manometer, etc...)
-measuring tools (digital micrometers, vernier, 
Etc...)
-an m18 coffee maker (if they made this one there is no upper limit on purchase price)
-pipe stands (V and roller style)
-give us the black packout in North America!
-1 tonne electric chain hoist (9567)
-2 tonne electric chain hoist (9571)

The next task is to cut the red rack in the back corner in half height wise, and modify it. One half will be turned into material storage with a bi-folding cover, this is to house the many bins full of pipe fittings. The other will be turned into a solid bench top, half of which will be wood topped, the other half will be rubber topped, and underneath will house our chain hoists. Currently the rack is 6 foot tall, x 77"" long x 30"" deep made by snap on.",15,1744415009.0,MilwaukeeTool,4,1.0,False

Hi im MJ(F25) and i love listening to your podcast and i would love to hear y’all’s opinion on what happened to me

The title is a little harsh but bear with me
I have been plus sized my whole life and have been bullied for it so it has always been a sore subject for me

I have slowly gotten comfortable at the gym and fixed my relationship with food in general 

With that explained i want to get into the real story; this happened a couple days ago at my place of work, i work at a coffee shop attached to a bookstore so all kinds of people come in and out.

I had just clocked in and this group of 5 kids walk up to the register to order, one kid (14? 15?) looked at me and said “ look its gorlock!!” Now i know who is referring to and I do a fake little annoyed laugh. I thought that would have been the end of it.

I then walk to help another customer and i walk from behind the counter and the kid looks at me “ daaaamn” i will not lie and say i kept a stone face and didnt respond i did, i responded back “ big talk for someone who looks like steve from Minecraft “ his friend tease him about it and i go back to working, he then whistles at me like a dog to get my attention.

I tell my manager in the cafe area so he is now aware, the kids finally walk off and i am shaking upset…

But that was just act one in this story

i have to go out back to take out our trash, it was a busy Saturday so i dont think anything of it

The way the trash cans are set up there is a small back ally area where the dumpsters are and there is a big grassy fence that separates the dumpster are and the road

My manager and i hear “ HEY GORLOCK!!!”
The kid was on the other side of the fence yelling this phrase at me over and over again.

We were both kinda shocked at first but my manager says “ get a life dude” and once again, from my pain i yell “ hows your parents divorce going? Oh? It hasnt happened yet, wait” which i know i should not have given him a reaction but i was hurt and i was desperately trying to defend myself and scare the kid away

The kid them proceeded to oink at me, over and over again, i was immediately thrown back to my mind in highschool and i started to cry, my manager sees and takes me inside to calm me down 

“ YEAH PIGGY GO BACK INSIDE”

That was the last thing i heard him say before my manager shut the door

I know i am in the wrong for arguing back with a child but yeah, i felt like typing it out would help

I can and will update if need be

Love yall, please be kind to eachother

1jx3yxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1jx3yxv/moving_from_sf_to_sac/,Moving from SF to Sac?,"TLDR: I have a long-term plan to move to Sac to raise my son but I'm having doubts about leaving SF. Want encouragement or discouragement so I can make an informed decision. 

  
I've lived in San Francisco for 12 years. I love the city, have made some great memories here, and think it will always feel like home. It's the longest I've ever lived in one place. It never made a ton of financial sense for me to be here, since it's an expensive city and I don't work in tech or any of the other big money industries that flock to this region. I am a teacher and a writer, so technically I could work anywhere. 

Over the past few years, post lockdown and in my early 30s, this has come into starker relief and I've felt it more palpably. I love SF for the views, the weather, the history, the multicultural food and experiences offered. I have a few favorite haunts that honestly feel like second homes; The Balboa Theater, Free Gold Watch pinball hall, Hole in the Wall pizza, Wooden coffee, the N-Judah muni line. I love the walkability and the parks. But I don't love the tech culture, the wealth culture, the neoliberal monoculture (I'm a Lefty, just not into mainstream Democrat culture.) I am married and raising a son now. My wife and I have been together the whole time I've been in SF (she used to be my gf) but we met at UC Davis and several of our college friends settled in Sacramento after college. Recently, we started taking about moving over there. 

There are a lot of reasons Sacramento appeals to us. We have friends there. We could actually afford to buy a home. Most of all, I think it's an actual middle class city, whereas San Francisco is gradually becoming more and more stratified between super rich and super poor. It's very important to raise my son around normal people, and by that I mean people who aren't just AI, Waymo, or Palantir techies. In the same vein, Sacramento is one of the most diverse cities in CA, racially, economically, and in terms of subcultures, which I think is a great environment to raise a kid. But obviously Sacramento is not quite San Francisco. And it's very hot sometimes. It's more car-centric, with less public transportation and less walkable space. Most of all, I see people on this subreddit and other platforms complain all the time about how much it sucks to live there. Though I know every place has haters, every now and then I get terrified. We low-key plan to move around Summer 2026. 

So, I guess I'm asking. Will I regret it? Will I learn to love it? What should I consider? Thanks for considering all my concerns. If I move to Sac I want to embrace it. Will I be able to? Or will I pine to return to San Francisco? I'm sure I'm far from the first to make this exact same move.",0,1744414865.0,Sacramento,12,0.2,False

The coffee kinda mellows out under the alcohol, the cinnamon gives the taste a bit of a shaper punch, and the vanilla gives it some body, though it would probably stand to have some more vanilla in there next time. It cleared out fairly nicely considering how opaque the coffee was already, though i didn't bother adding gelatin or anything. It has caffeine of course, which is one of the main things. Something like 5% alcohol, which is about what i can expect anyways since i used a ginger bug.

Recipe:

Slightly under a gallon of coffee machine coffee, i just used cheap 7/11 grounds.

A whole stick of cinnamon, brewed into a strong tea until the stick itself is flavorless.

Like 12 chopped up raisins, for nutrients.

2 teaspoons of vanilla extract

Half a kilo of sugar, and 60\~ grams of sugar for priming.

Yeast, i used my ginger bug.

Just mix the sugar and chopped raisings into the still-hot coffee straight from the machine, mix the cinnamon tea and vanilla extract in, wait for it to cool and add in the yeast.

Bathroom is in the centre of the 2 bedroom unit, and the bathroom exhaust fan is exhausting directly into the HVAC ducts and the smells blow directly through the ceiling vents literally throughout the entire unit. The smell is most concentrated (I would say 100% bathroom air) at the ceiling vents closer to the bathroom in the loop, and our master bedroom is at the end of the loop and gets probably 80% bathroom smells. 

Landlord’s HVAC crew originally claimed nothing is wrong, ducts are set up according to building code. I kept pressing and the property manager tested with a room spray in my unit and the one directly below mine (I’m 16th floor). He confirmed the smells are intensely going through the vents. Corporate continues to claim this is not evidence of cross contamination.

An HVAC engineer came in, opened up the hvac system and said the bathroom exhaust is being blown into the system, and then processed through the exhaust. He claims this is the standard for apartments and condos and nothing is wrong.

I was looking for a banana couldn’t find one, used beet root instead. Core goal was to use milk made to make some light dinner item. 

I was trying to make a simple banana milkshake but didn’t have bananas. Out of sheer desperation (and curiosity), I ended up blending together milk, Milkmaid, peanut butter, beetroot, coffee, dry fruits, kesar syrup… and honestly? It kinda slapped.

I served it in a whiskey glass (because why not?), looked cool, tasted earthy-sweet with a bitter coffee hit—and clocked in around 774 kcal (I did the math too, see attached chart).

That’s when I found myself going down a rabbit hole…
What exactly is a milkshake? A smoothie? A Prunie??

Turns out:
	•	A milkshake is dairy-heavy, often with ice cream.
	•	A smoothie focuses on fruits/nuts/greens, sometimes with milk or yogurt.
	•	A Prunie (yes, thanks Louis Litt from Suits) is a prune-heavy fiber bomb, usually fruit-based.

What I made was technically a milk-based smoothie—thick, nourishing, semi-detox-y, but definitely not a Prunie.

Anyway, I learnt something new, had a tasty experiment, and am now lowkey proud of my random creation.

Alright, friends! So, I knew I needed a change. My mornings were the equivalent of a cat trying to swim. You get it, right? Dragging myself out of bed, stumbling through a fog of “why am I awake?”, and kicking off my day with Netflix instead of productivity. Sound familiar? 

**Here’s a wild idea: What if mornings could actually feel good?** Like, *energizing* good? I decided to spend 30 days deliberately rewiring my morning routine, and the results were nothing short of insane. Spoiler alert: my productivity shot up by 300%! 🎉 Yes, you read that right!

**Here’s how I did it:**

1. **Set a *Realistic* Wake-Up Time**: 
   - No more 5 AM craziness if you aren’t a morning person. I set my alarm just 30 minutes earlier than usual. Letting my body adjust gradually was key.
  
2. **Hydration Station**: 
   - First thing after waking? Chug water like I just finished the Sahara marathon. Seriously, I found that starting my day hydrated helped with clarity.

3. **Mindful Movement**:
   - I swapped out the snooze button for some light stretching or a short walk. Talk about a game changer! Getting my blood moving elevated my mood and kicked my brain into gear.

4. **Tech Detox**:
   - I took a break from screens for the first hour. Yikes, I know! No scrolling through social media while I guzzled my coffee. Instead, I focused on journaling or reading. Immediate vibe boost!

5. **Gratitude Ritual**:
   - Every morning, I wrote down three things I was grateful for. Sounds cheesy? Maybe. But it shifted my mindset from “ugh, it’s morning” to “heck yeah, let’s tackle today!”

6. **Meal Prep Like a Boss**:
   - Breakfast was no longer a frantic rush. I prepped simple, nutritious breakfasts ahead of time. Cheers to smoothies and overnight oats that make mornings feel like a breeze!

7. **Set Daily Intentions**:
   - I started writing down one main goal for the day. For instance, “Complete that project” or “Have a meaningful conversation with a friend.” Laser-focused and ready to attack!

**Wild? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.** 

Now, if you’re reading this and thinking, “What else can I do differently?” you’re not alone. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. There were days I’d hit the snooze button *twice* and end up racing against the clock. But that’s the beauty of progress, right?

1jx3p8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1jx3p8l/saw_my_ex_today/,saw my ex today,"hey guys i am NC with my ex but as a backstory me and him were on and off for a good year and a half, and we finally just ended things permanently on St. Patrick's Day so about a month ago. it was his call so I obviously haven't tried to reach out well I did a couple times, but after that week was over I haven't done anything. so today I went over to this little park that has nice views of the ocean and I went there today because I wanted to start reading a book I had just gotten and do some journaling because I haven't done that in a while. I also got done up all nice and pretty cause I haven't felt pretty in a while. I got a new drink from this new coffee shop like I was having a great day. so anyways I'm sitting in my car at the park I start journaling and I have to use the bathroom super bad so I finish up my journal entry and in that journal entry I had talked about change and how I'm accepting the change in my life and how I've been moving forward and the growth I've experienced and there was a couple of sentences about my ex in there. So after I'm done I go to leave and I see a car and for some reason I have this feeling that he's in the car. It's not his car and I was like OK and I drive-by and I see him like looking around, but I don't see his face and it looks like he's trying to avoid me seeing him so I pull over for a second to recuperate and think and then I decide to just drive and leave in the direction where I could see if it was him because obviously I'm gonna see if it was him I was madly in love with this man and it is him, and he was laughing, and it looked like there was a girl in the car, but I didn't look at her when I was driving by and now I'm like I don't wanna reach out, but it was so weird because he obviously knows what my car looks like and the car that they were in was parked fairly close to me and they had clearly gotten there after me because after I had finished reading my book before I started journaling I looked around and there was nobody really in the area and I'm just like did he tell her to park there after seeing my car because there's two entrances to the place and either way pulling in either direction he would've seen me or noticed my car and it's like was he trying to make me jealous? I mean, I didn't even see the girl so I don't even know but it's kind of crazy because before we had ended things there was kind of a mutual agreement that we wouldn't talk for like a year and just get stuff going on our own and he told me that he wasn't gonna be pursuing anybody or you know hooking up with anybody because he wants to actually get his shit together( i took that with a grain of salt honestly) but the circumstances kind of changed because the last time that we had talked. I was really drunk, and I had called him a bunch of times and he had ended up blocking me so I kind of accepted that we wouldn't talk in a year, but when I passed by and looked at him and noticed that it was him he was laughing so I'm just like did you know I was there or did you just so happen to coincidentally park near me because it was a coincidence that we were there at the same time but it's just like so weird because now I'm like there was so much of a cycle where we would talk and not talk, and there was a couple of times where he did hook up with other people, and he did end up talking to me after hooking up with those people but now I feel like I'm spiraling because I didn't wanna see him but then I also did I mean it's a public park and I was in the area because I was getting an oil change and I wanted to go there and have a good day for myself and I was like oh you know what if I do see him but then I was like I don't think I will and then BAM I do see him. sorry for the long message but like I'm low-key overthinking and just like needed to get it off my chest, especially with other people that are in no contact with somebody maybe some words of encouragement to not think so deeply about it (even though i already have😂) thank you and if you read this far, thank you. also, I know that he's single so he can do whatever he want. It was just so jarring and especially for the fact that they were parked so close to my car and got there after me has me just wondering what the hell was his thought process and was it intentional to park near me because there's a whole strip of parking it's not just a one little parking lot. It's a whole thing along the coastline. so yeah 😂",2,1744414064.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False

I have tried off and on to do a raw vegan primarily fruitarian diet and cant hang on for long. Honestly I am really frustrated and confused what I’m doing wrong. I eat a variety of fruit mostly bananas, pineapple, orange and orange juice, and mixed berries. 3-4 days a week I’ll have something like a sweet potato or chickpeas for dinner. Also, I have been self administering intramuscular b12 injections monthly for about 1.5 years now. I keep my sodium under 200mg usually. I was highly encouraged to get a blood test done which revealed low potassium and anemia to my surprise. Also, lately my heart rate is trash when I’m training on my road bike (bad for me is something like 105-120bpm when 138-155 would actually be normal).

I love the way I feel eating this way but I feel deficient so in desperation I’ll eat at the cafeteria where I work and eat a salty meal with some kind of meat, usually red meat like beef, which almost immediately remediates my poor heart rate and I just feel more energetic.

I sweat a lot, run about 18-24 miles a week on average and roughly 200 miles a week on my road bike and I’m very conscious of how my body is doing. I drink one cup of coffee a day. I would say I feel a little unhealthy at the moment due to these factors but seem to do well for a few days after introducing some meat which I would really rather not be doing from an ethical and health standpoint. I’m assuming that I have iron deficient anemia and the low potassium is tied to low sodium since those two electrolytes keep each other balanced. The heart rate thing seems very tied into this as well.

Added: If I was to introduce meat products into my diet what amount would be necessary to remediate my symptoms? I’m doing another blood test next week to see how things have changed in the last 3 months, but likely little has changed. I am taking an iron supplement today, obviously natural supplementation is ideal but I can’t always get red meat since I live on a military facility and can’t cook anything outside of a microwave. I like to keep things really bare bones. Would fruit for breakfast before training, sweet potatoes for lunch and sweet potatoes/chicken or beef for dinner be a good simple meal plan?

They visualize, script, and affirm… but they’re still stressed about when it’s going to happen.

But think about it — do you stress over your morning coffee?

No.
You follow the steps.
You expect the result.
And it shows up — because you trust the process.

In this short video, I explain how applying that same “coffee energy” to your manifestation routine changes everything.

What am I here for?

A genuine connection. I’m not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that’s just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

For the past couple days for some reason, a specific spot in the back lower right of my mouth bleeds when I floss. It doesn’t bleed when I brush my teeth, only when I floss, and it doesn’t bleed anywhere else. The bleeding also immediately stops when I start to brush after flossing. I also experience no pain or discomfort whatsoever when flossing or brushing the area. 

I am 26, I do not smoke, drink coffee, or alcohol. The worst thing I do is have a glass or two of cola a day. 

Is this immediate cause for concern? 


Or should I slowly monitor it over a week or more and see?

Nico Bella’s on Dorrance Street, located just a block from City Hall, made the announcement on Friday.

Featuring such staples as eggs benedict and chicken and waffles, all-day breakfast was the centerpiece of the business. 

“I built the restaurant old-school, selling food and paying for equipment,"" owner Daniel Crenca told GoLocal. ""I was in really good shape before the pandemic, but I just couldn’t get out from under it,” 

Crenca noted that the restaurant is just the latest closure downtown. which in recent years has included Yoleni’s, Kin, and more. 

Nico Bella’s had been open for ten years.

It will now be shutting its doors at the end of April.

According to Crenca, the restaurant features the largest holding of the artwork of top local artist Bert Crenca, and all artwork is for sale at a substantially reduced price. 

“The restaurant will be open for business for breakfast and lunch seven days a week and Friday and Saturday nights, between now and April 27 and will be open for Easter Sunday, April 20 until 1 PM,” said Crenca. “The owners and staff would like to go out with a bang - please come in, enjoy some excellent food and drinks, and join us with our heads held high for a goodbye with a smile.”

“Please keep in mind we are still available for private parties, a great meal, or even just a coffee until the last day we are open,” he added. “Your support in these last days is needed and much appreciated by the Crenca family and staff.”

Crenca noted Friday his is moving forward with his newest endeavor - Angell Gallery on the East Side of Providence - and that he plans to expand his Christmas nonprofit now moving forward. ",14,1744413832.0,providence,9,0.9,False

I’m a social worker and the caddy behavior really grinds my gears. There is a clique of four individuals who don’t do work, have all hours to gossip and never get in trouble. 

They used to go get lunches for people and for whatever reason they have excluded me for months while asking everyone else in the office what they want and even bringing in coffees for everyone but me. 

I have a few office besties. Or so I thought. Today for whatever reason office bestie pulls me aside. They had been acting different than usual. They told me that they cannot trust me because the four individuals have told them that I talk shit about them. Now I admit I have a very sarcastic sense of humor and try to be liked by all. Sometimes I would say ooo X is in a mood today just joking. Well they ran back to them and have said I’m talking shit. 

The funny thing is prior to my notice I have sat at my desk not interacted with anyone and still get the cold shoulder that I am starting drama. Even attempt to make small talk but lesson learned I’m ignored. I don’t know why I try. I admit at first I wanted to be liked by all but now I realize my bestie is my true friend. 

He asked me why I didn’t come to him. I told him look I have nothing against him and nothing to come to him with. We both agreed to try to remain friends after I leave. However this hurt me that he believes this group over me. 

I know I deserve better. I’m just over it and can’t wait to start new job. Does anyone have any similar stories of having coworkers who were besties and then believed others?

1jx354u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1jx354u/emotionally_charged_dreams_several_days_in_a_row/,Emotionally charged dreams several days in a row,"
Last week I had very emotional dreams several days in a row and I kind of want help interpreting what they might have meant. All of them had very different settings.

Dream 1: I’m in highschool joking around with some friends and I blurt out to one of them “omg you fucking bitch 🤣🤣”. All of a sudden I get yelled at from behind by the school principal who brings me into the office and I’m threatened with expulsion for using vulgar language. My only way not to get expelled is if I admit to being the suspect of a sexual assault crime in the news which I did not commit. Of course throughout this portion of the dream I’m frustrated, heated and verbally angry with the unfairness of the situation as I’m being forced into 2 very bad outcomes.
Some context; the principal in this dream is played by my work department VP who I would say I don’t really have a close relationship with and who I’m slightly fearful and avoidant of, as he was a major player in the laying off of my close coworkers and management after our department was absorbed into his.

Dream 2: I’m a refugee escaping a war torn country with several other random ppl. We as a group make it past several almost deadly situations to a safe zone. However we realize a child in our group has lost their mother in the process and for some reason I’m uncontrollably sobbing. 

Dream 3: I have a very intense sex dream with a past FWB. Some kinks and Exhibitionism was involved in this dream.
Context: I was really attracted to this person but he did not want anything more than sex with me. He later ended our FWB when pursued a relationship with someone else.

Dream 4: I’m having coffee date/hangout with various friends. Were joking around and doing various group activities. It’s fun and the feeling of happiness and joy was really strong. In the dream I’m also in a relationship. 

Context: A lot of ppl in my life appeared in this dream including a situationship which I ended this past January (due to him being unsure of what he wanted, not displaying physical affection but still flirting with me and being verbally affectionate) and an ex best friend whom ended our friendship last year (due to both of us not seeing eye to eye on how she behaved in a situation, she quietly ghosted me after we had a very emotional talk regarding that). These 2 individuals probably had the most significant presence in this dream. The situationship portrayed my bf in the dream and my relationship with the ex best friend felt like old times. 

I definitely felt a sense of sadness and longing, maybe some regret after waking up from the 3rd and 4th dream.
