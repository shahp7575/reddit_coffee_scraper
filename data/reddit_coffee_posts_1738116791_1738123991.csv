Let me say at the start that I am aware of Car Play and AA, but would like to set that aside for the moment and focus on the native system. I have two questions: 

1.  Am I correct that no Mazda subscription service has anything to do with the nav, such that the nav is based solely on the data on the SD card and not connected to the internet in any way?

2.  Regardless of the answer to question one, I want to know what the voice command capabilities are for points of interest.  Can I say ""navigate to Home Depot"" and a list of nearby HDs will come up?  Can I say ""find coffee shops"" or only ""find Starbucks""?  What about a specific, but lesser known business like ""Edna's Shoe Shop""?  Or a hotel like Hampton Inn?  My sense is that other than a few well-known names like Starbucks, it is pretty much limited to broad categories, like ""shopping"" or ""lodging"", but I don't know so that's why I'm asking.

1icl0wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1icl0wu/do_not_eat_the_bird_part_1/,Do Not Eat The Bird... (Part 1),"CONTENT WARNING - GRAPHIC, SQUICK

The man that I had served three times over the last couple of weeks was polishing off his latest blowout: 4 kale and quinoa salads, 2 house chop salads, 3 jalapeno cheeseburgers done rare, medium, and well done, all with a side of our sweet-potato fries, a 32 oz bone-in ribeye, 3 sides of mashed potatoes, an order of our nacho platter plate with steak (meant for at least 2 people), and a large margherita pizza with anchovies, onions, sausage, and extra mozzarella and olive oil on the side for dipping.

Each time he had placed his order with me, I would hesitate to punch in the entire to-do list for the kitchen. The food never all came out at the same time, so he would wait while the salads became soggy, the burgers grew cold, and nachos turned stale - and after the final part of the order was awkwardly and delicately placed on the edge of his table, he would feast. 

The first time he sat down, it took him over an hour and a half to finish. The second, he shaved off around 20 minutes. But this latest round only took him half an hour. Each plate would end up completely spotless. He would sit with a look of complete indifference as he used a toothpick to gather up the stragglers hidden between his teeth, and then pay his over-$400 bill with cash, and leave like it was nothing.

He never tipped me once. 

I began to build resentment for the man. His snacking in my section of the restaurant caused some tension between me and the kitchen, who had to spend up to an hour preparing the man’s meal. The bussers that had to clean up after him demanded more from my tip-out at the end of my shift, but I think they were just jumping on the bandwagon since there was never a drop of food left anywhere on the plates or table. The hope was that the 3rd time's the charm and I would never serve this man again.

But the man was seated in my section the very next day.

The evening before, I had skipped dinner for no reason other than pure ignorance. The next morning, I skipped breakfast because I had accidentally slept through my alarm, only able to grab a cup of reheated black coffee from the back of the service well that tasted like tar. When I thought that my day could not get any rougher, the man was seated. I screamed in my mind as the frustration and impatience began to pierce a hole in my forehead. I took a deep breath in order to get my shit together, threw back the last of the lukewarm tar, and stopped by the kitchen’s expo line before I greeted my guest.

“Before I go over there,” I said to our head chef, “I want to apologize in advance.”

Chef looked up at me from his cutting board with gentle eyebrows before looking over my shoulder to see who I was referring to. He grimaced slightly, but looked back at me and said, “I don’t care.”

Relief hit me. My face relaxed, my shoulders drooped, and I took another deep breath as I prepared my script in my head. All of that stress leaving my body, however, made my stomach grumble.

“Hello sir, how’re you doing today?” I asked the man in my customer service voice as I approached his table.

“Quite fine,” he replied. His voice had an oaky quality, like aged bourbon. It matched the navy blue suit that carefully pinned itself to his curvy figure, probably weighing in at 250 lbs. He was by no means a man that looked like he could eat over 9 thousand calories of food in one sitting, let alone three separate times. Yet here he was, going for a home run.

I pulled out the small tablet we used to place our orders and loosened up my fingers, preparing for the breakneck pace at which he’d tell me the cornucopia of american cuisine he would wish to indulge in. Maybe I’d be able to punch it all in without stopping to double check any of the items. Fingers at the ready, eyes locked in, I asked - 

“What can I get started for you today?”

He pursed his lips as his eyes scanned the menu for what felt like minutes. Up, down, left, right, flipping it over, down, right, down, left, up. It was almost robotic. 

His belly bulged and his chest rose like the rising moon as he took a deep breath.

“I’m good with water for now, thank you.”

My fingers cramped up.

“Yeah I’ll get some water for you while you take a look.”

He swiftly fanned the menu from his lap to me, looked me in the eye, and said, “that will be all.”

Time froze for reasons I can only assume were cosmically induced. The man was able to pick out at least 10 to 15 courses of food by the time I would greet him, but, now, he claimed water was all he needed. The look in his eyes was merciful, the gray in his beard shimmering against the brunch sun peeking through the front windows. Did I dare question the opportunity raised to me to have a day of peace with the man that had made me build up so much resentment over the past 2 weeks? Or-

*Rrrrrrr*

My stomach cut off my train of thought. The man's eyes traversed to my gut, then back up to me. I swiped the menu from his hand, and walked away.

The glass of ice water I poured for the man was as nervous as I was - sweating like a dog. I placed the glass on the table with a wrapper-less straw next to it and waited for any other instructions from my esteemed regular. He simply strawed his glass, paused to glance me over, then waved me off.

I trudged my way back to the service bar and finally exhaled the breath I had been holding for minutes straight. A weight had been lifted from my chest. Hopefully, I would be able to go about the rest of my shift in peace for the rest of the morning, and perhaps order myself a chicken sandwich on the way out-

*Rrrrrrrr*

I let out a sigh, straightened my back, and put my head back in the game. 

I had gotten a 2-top seated in my section. I gathered their utensils, placed them in front of them, and started my schtick.

“Hello folks,” I vomited, “how are we doing today?”

“Quite fine,” the gentleman said, smiling over to who I assumed was his mother sitting across from him. “How about yourself?”

“Ahh I’m doing alright, thanks. My name is-”

*Sllllrrrrrp*

A loud combination of loose water and swirling ice cubes filled my ears, like it was being directed at me specifically. Sure enough, I turned around, and the man had finished his glass of water, now looking into me with the same indifference I had seen three times before.

“My apologies,” he said, bluntly, “may I get a refill as soon as you get the chance?”

I didn’t have time to process how off the man’s mannerisms made me feel before my server brain took action. “Of course sir! One moment!”

I turned back to the couple at hand. “Can I start you off with something to drink?”

“Oh waters will be fine for us,” the mother said, “and maybe an order of those nachos. I’ve been lookin’ forward to those.”

“Yeah, I’ll getchya guys a couple waters, and an order of nachos to start ya off with-”

“And don’t forget my refill…” the relief I had felt not long ago had been uprooted. At that moment, I already knew the day would not be smooth sailing like I had hoped.

I dropped off the beverages, and refilled the man’s glass, asking him if he would like anything else. He declined. I left. I was sat another table in my section.

Before I could even reach the table to greet them, a glass with the man’s arm attached to it was shoved into my path, demanding another refill. He would continue to do this for the next 10 hours, and, since he was a part of my section regardless of any purchases he had or hadn’t made, he was my responsibility. I was forced to take a 30 minute break around my 5th hour. Just before that break, I put in an order for the sandwich I was hankering for. However, the restaurant had slowly begun to bustle over the afternoon, a frenzy breaking out into the weekend lunch rush. The kitchen failed to make my sandwich in time, and I received the food after I clocked back in.

I left my food in a to-go box in mourning of my first meal and snapped back into work mode the best I could. During my time off, the server that breaked my section told me they had to refill the man’s glass at least 7 times. I had done some counting myself, starting around his third refill. The man sat down at 11:05 am, received his water around 11:07, got his first refill at 11:10, and requested a refill every 3-5 minutes. By the time the restaurant began closing, I had refilled the man’s water glass 197 times, prompted by a snapping sound, a whistle, or a simple shaking of the remaining ice in his glass.

A person should not be drinking more than 4-5 glasses of water in one sitting, otherwise they run the risk of overhydration. Even after the feats of dining I have witnessed this month from this man alone, I was surprised. His beard and clothes had remained completely dry during the entire endeavor and he was once again unbothered to a disturbing degree. However, in the moment, the physical and mental exhaustion from the strained customer service environment and the starvation on behalf of my idiocracy kept me from thinking about any of it.

A minute to closing, I walked up to the man for what, I hoped, would be the final time. The restaurant was cleared, the lights were turned up, and the front doors swung wide open, letting a brisk chill skip throughout the main dining area, all the tell-tale signs of workers ready to go home.

I refilled his glass with the last bit of water left in the metallic pitcher, then watched him put the straw to his lips and suck the entirety of the liquid in one fell gulp. He leaned back, letting the remainder of the ice in the bottom fall into his gullet as he chomped and crunched. In my haze, I could’ve sworn he had accidentally taken a bite out of the glass itself. The autopilot that had been running my body for the better part of the evening spurred into action -

“Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?” I asked. I was on the brink of fainting. I could almost smell the food I left in the back from across the restaurant. I knew my manager wouldn’t make me do any side work since I was technically not supposed to be here. So all I needed to do was finish up this man’s lack of ordering, and I’d be home free.

“You know,” he said, “if it isn’t too much trouble, as I know y’all will be closing here in a minute, I’d like to place one chicken sandwich with a side salad to go, and then I think I’ll be on my way.”

This was a sick game to him. That’s when I figured it out. But I don’t believe I could have predicted just how twisted it could get.

I stared at him in disbelief. The kitchen - they had wiped down all of the grills. They wrapped up all of their dry ingredients in saran wrap and put them away for the openers to pull down tomorrow. The frying oil we used to make our chicken was long gone, and if I were to punch in this order, they would need to refill the vat at least half way for it to meet our standards. They would be here for another half hour to clean up the mess I would make them make. 

This was it. This was when I needed to pull the trigger. My manager would have my back. The kitchen would have my back. This man has sat in the restaurant the entire time I’ve been here just to torture me, not ordering a single god-damn dish, and I could not stand for it.

And yet…something…compelled me. Call it people pleasing, call it customer service conditioning, but saying no to guests was my weakness…

8:59, not a soul at a table, not even in the man in front of me, I believed. “One fried chicken sandwich…with coleslaw, house-made pickles, spicy sriracha mayo spread, a slice of swiss cheese, and a side of our house salad made with romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots, cucumber slices, and our homemade honey-mustard vinaigrette-”

“Oh, dressing on the side, please.”

“...with the dressing on the side…anything else…sir?” I could not contain my disappointment in myself. I have failed in basic self-respect. It’s as if in stuffing his face, the man accidentally ate my backbone without me noticing.

“No. That’ll be it. And I’ll close out with my card.”

Tap…tap…tap my fingers trudged across the tablet.

“That will be $15.63. Please insert your card in the top slot.”

The man complied. The sound of a bell signifying a new order at the expo line rang like a gong signalling the end of the world, followed by Chef spewing profanities in tongues I’ve never heard before. And as the man tapped his sausage-link fingers to sign the tablet, I felt as if I had truly heard his voice for the first time.

“Do you have any plans tonight?” He asked innocently. It was too late for me to express any true feelings, so I played along.

“Oh, not much. I got dinner ready for me in the back, so when I’m done, I’m gonna scarf that down and head on home and pass out. How about-”

Before I could finish asking him about his own plans, he looked up at me in pleasant surprise. “Oh! That sounds nice! Well, before you go and do that, let me just give ya some advice!”

I was so hungry that I could eat the anticipation for what he would say. And then he said it;

“Don’t eat the worms, don’t eat the boars, *and*, and I cannot stress this enough, do *not* under *any circumstances*, eat the bird.”

As he handed me my tablet, my response didn’t exist. I walked away. I was humbled beyond comprehension. I felt broken. I felt ashamed. I felt hungry. 

I dodged the nasty looks of the line cooks opening a fresh tub of cooking oil. I barrelled past the walk-in fridge and let the rest of the preparation rooms I needed to walk through to get to my food pass me in a blur. I was only moments away from passing out. I could feel it. The lack of nutrition in my body, the lack of anything substantive, made me feel like I could die right then and there.

I left my to-go container underneath a shelf in the break room where most of us servers place our food. My other senses had been completely dulled by the aching in my gut, so I could not detect the hint of lemony-citrus floor cleaner until it was too late. The break room had been cleaned out.

My food was thrown away.

Tears. Actual tears ran down my cheek. I hardly let myself be that dramatic, but the release was vindicating. I plopped onto the floor, disregarding the crazy amount of overtime I would be racking up. I could have sat there forever - trapped in my stasis lock of fleeting and confusing emotions. Is this hysteria? Is this what it was like to reach your breaking point-

Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

I wanted to scream in harmony with the beast in my belly, begging for scraps, before I took the second deepest breath of my life. The flow of oxygen into my lungs brought clarity. Clarity brought focus. The man’s food would be ready soon, and I could leave. I could drive home, slowly, and make myself anything I wanted out of the treasure chest that was my pantry. 

5 more minutes, I told myself.

I forced myself up, walked out of the break room, and made my way back to the main floor. The man was gone. The kitchen was clean. There were no signs of anybody here. I walked over to the POS, typed in my code, and clocked the fuck out. I ripped my apron off in a flurry, unbuttoning my work shirt like I was superman ready to take off into the free night sky. 

But as my palm hit the door and felt the cool wood finish, something caught the corner of my eye. The small trash bin sitting right near the front. Inside, sat a brown to-go box - *his* brown to-go box, no doubt. Why? Why all the trouble to be here for a full day, place an order to go the moment before we contractually can’t make you dinner anymore, just to eat it at the table? I needed to know. 

I pulled the box from the fresh trash bag. It was hefty. I opened the box and found a half eaten chicken sandwich topped with coleslaw and spicy sriracha mayo. The pickles had been taken off and placed haphazardly on the side, mingling with the house salad which had been completely mixed up after being tossed in the garbage.

My mind raced and all reasoning seemed to be hanging on by a finger tip. I couldn’t. I wouldn’t. I was many things; dramatic, hyperbolic, flamboyant, but not desperate. I could not bring myself to picture the scene in my head any further…until I felt the underside of the box.

A piece of receipt paper was stuck to the bottom, held by the grease leaking through from the freshly fried chicken breast. I pulled it off, uncrumpled it and held it to my eyes. On a $15.63 tab, the man who had never once tipped me after spending over a thousand dollars, finally did.

A single dollar. 

Yes, I was dramatic, hyperbolic, and flamboyant, but not desperate. 

However, I was very, very petty.

Rage and frustration overcame my mouth as I downed the half-eaten chicken sandwich in nearly a full bite. My hunger, at this point, was the furthest thing from my mind as the resentment I had built up took over to finish this to-go meal from the garbage out of pure spite. 

The sandwich hurt my throat on the way down. I very easily could have choked. I dug into the salad with my bare hands, the dressing spilling out of its own little ramekin and covering the bottom of the cardboard box with its greasy, sticky substance. And when I was done with the salad, I drank what little was left of the vinaigrette as if it was a shot of sake. Satisfaction trickled down my lips as shame was bottled up and shoved to the back. I walked out of the restaurant taller than I walked in and made my way home.

I felt no need to raid my fridge or my pantry as I settled into bed, forgetting to change out of my grease ridden clothing, 

One good night of sleep would allow me to reset and forget this whole ordeal. At least, that was the hope. That night, I ignored the rumbling in my stomach, too tired to be hungry. And yet, after not heeding the man’s advice, I would do just about anything to feel true hunger ever again…

I met a guy recently at my work & it seemed like we really hit it off. I work in a family practice doctor’s office as a receptionist and he’s a sales rep that one of our docs reached out to. He’s been in the office 3 times and each time it’s seemed like he’s been flirting with me. (I’m not exactly the best judge when it comes to this type of thing though & I was flirting back but again, not great at that either lol). He gave me his number the first visit to send a coffee order for the meeting he scheduled with the doctors, which isn’t unusual for sales reps. So he does have my number, but there’s been no communication outside of the office. Am I reading too much into it? Is it more likely he was just being a good salesman? I can’t stop thinking about him, which is extremely annoying, but I don’t want to make the first move in case he’s not interested and then have it be super awkward any time he comes into the office.

My(22F) friend(21F) got engaged in September of 2022 to her fiance(22F) who I don't know super well. Him and I have talked on several occasions over the phone and over text but only met once. The texts and call were all with he knowledge and she even encouraged it. Her and I were pretty close in high school and then she moved really far away where she met her fiance. Anytime she came to visit i would see her and take her out for coffee or dinner and talked the night away! I wouldve come to visit her but she lived on the other end of the cpuntry and school didnt allow it. Anyway, before she even publicly announced her engagement, she told me and asked me to be a bridesmaid! Of course I said yes and we talked wedding stuff occasionally throughout the years. 
Recently she's been going through it, I reached out often to check on her and also talk about the wedding plans. She picked me out a dress which I loved and I was just so excited. One day I realize I haven't heard from her in a while so I message her on Instagram. After a few days with no response, I get worried. I texted her, looked her up everywhere, called her, texted her bf and eventually called him to get a hold of her. I asked him if she was okay and if she blocked me? He said he wasn't sure but he would check with her. She messaged me ""sorry I blocked you"" and I responded with ""it's okay, are you okay""?? We talked for a few hours and then again talked wedding planning. This was like December of last year. Then this year since the wedding is in September, I asked her if I needed to be there for anything before the wedding day? She said ""oh, I've been meaning to talk about that. 
 I decided to have another friend be a bridesmaid instead of you, it is an agreement with fiance, he just doesn’t understand you like I do and we had to compromise. I’m sorry.""

Obviously I was hurt and said I was sad. Then she said ""It’s not that we don’t want you to come but I’ve gotten closer with other people here and it makes more sense to hang out with people he and I know and not people I just know. It is my decision, but it was also a compromise.
I do still want you there to celebrate but if you don't want to go anymore, I understand.""

Two years ago I made two friends through work. Let’s call them friend A and friend B. When I started to hang around them I would bring my partner and we all became good friends. 

I have autism and it’s not for everybody. It creates challenges in all relationships. Some people are willing to work through those challenges to keep the friendship, some people don’t care to, and that’s fine. 

Friend A is more epithetic towards me than friend B. Friend B is always in friend A’s ear telling her not to be because she’s a very, “I can do whatever I want without the considerations of others and you should too” type person. 

Personally I’m tired of it, but they’re the only friends I’ve had since highschool. They’re my only socialization other than work. They go out a lot and without them I’d never leave my apartment. It feels nice to have friends to go places with and spend time with. 

Recently though its felt like they don’t want to hangout with me, they just want to hangout with my partner. My partner will get invited to go shopping or get coffee on days I’m working and can’t go, and nobody tells me when they’re going anywhere in the first place. It seems intentional. A few days ago a coworker told me they’re going out with friend A and friend B to an event *I told them about and said I wanted to go to*! I was really upset hearing this, considering they wouldn’t have even known about the event unless I told them. 

Then today, I was working a closing shift with friend A. When we clocked out I asked if she had a ride home, she said that friend B was going to pick her up. I then get home to discover that my partner isn’t home. I texted my partner and asked where they went. My partner responded saying they’re at a café with friend B, but friend B just went to go pick up friend A from work and bring her back to the café for coffee. I was confused because my partner *knew* I was working with friend A that night and could have told me so I could come with them. I questioned my partner and all they said was that they didn’t think about it…

It all seems intentional to me. I may be autistic but I’m not stupid.. I’m not sure how to navigate this. ",1,1738122241.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Im never really in one place for long and bounce around quite a bit, have been for a few years now. Subsequently, having a relationship is really hard. Around 3 years ago I became single again, very low part in my life fiscally and spiritually. Ive built up quite a bit since then, really grown as a person and have come a long way which Im proud of. The part that kills me is talking to women, I just turn red, bumble my words and cant keep my thoughts straight. The main reason for this post is I went to a pizzeria more than 1000 miles from home and had a waitress that just was perfect. So pretty, and easy to get lost in her eyes, great physique and phenomenal manners too. A person I would like to have a coffee with and exchange thoughts, just rake the brain and see how they see the world. But no, couldnt do it. Only thing I could do was meekly ask about the beer selection to hint toward my age and hopefully get ID'ed to spark a conversation about why Im 7 states from home. Nope, she brought my drink, I tipped 100% and left with my tail between my legs. The only thought Ive had since leaving 6 hours ago is how cowardly I was to not even try or give a compliment or anything. Im fundamentally disappointed in myself.",1,1738122237.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

1icktmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1icktmo/dinner_date_tomorrow_with_a_pretty_awesome_woman/,Dinner date tomorrow with a pretty awesome woman I met through OLD. Suggestions re: questions & conversation tips?,"Hi everyone! So after much fumbling around with OLD, I (M55) seem to have actually met someone who's pretty cool (F47). We had our first coffee date last week and it was one of those things where we totally ran out of time and had way too much fun talking and sharing about life in general. The cafe was actually closing and we had to leave. It was one of ""those"" kind of great talks.

FWIW I can totally tell she's really ""into"" me, her non-verbal body language was just so plain obvious. Think she has a crush on me. It was adorable. I'm a little more cautious, just because I want to approach this responsibly and not go too far, or too fast.

We're meeting for dinner tomorrow (her idea!) and I'm really looking forward to it.

So here's my question for the hive mind:

1. I know it's likely wayyyy to early to get into the nuts and bolts of our exes and married histories, etc. (I'm divorced 3 years, she's about 5 years). This is only our second date. But we touched on the basics. I know the plain outline of her history, and she knows mine.

I am well-aware to NOT bring up stories of sour-grapes and bitterness about past partners, traumatic divorces, etc. I know that's a total downer. Plus, I'm not bitter about any of it anyway. I've healed and moved on. Nothing to see here, folks.

But I am a firm believer that it's important to ask a date ""what did you learn from your last relationship?"" Vanilla things of that nature. Does that sound OK?

  
2. I have a modest understanding about her career. She is a professor at a local university and super smart. Maybe get her to open up about her passion? Conversely, I could tell her more about mine, to keep it balanced?

3. I know very basic info about her upbringing in Europe (we are both in Canada). Is talking about immediate family fair game? Parents, extended family? And same for me. Don't really want to bring up ""family issues"" yet (?) but can't see why that wouldn't hurt? But maybe it's fair game? Learning about family dynamics tells you a lot about a person, doesn't it?

4. IIRC she hasn't dated much in about a year, whereas I'm 6 months out of a 2.5 relationship. My most recent relationship was really tumultuous, but I learned a lot. Probably still too early to bring this stuff up, correct? Again, I don't want to sound like I'm dwelling on the past. I have closed the chapter on that part of my life, but it definitely did have an influence on me after being out of the dating game for 20 years.

5. There's always the safe bet about talking about how amazing our respective kids are. That's usually a good bet.

I see building a great friendship with this person and possibly moving it further from there. But I'm a little rusty at dating convo so just wanted to ask for any suggestions. Compliments, fun flirty banter is what I'm looking for. FWIW people have told me that I'm genuine, easy to talk to.

Thanks in advance! If people want, I can give an update on the post-dinner date to mention what worked, and what I needed to improve on.

Appreciate you guys! Thanks very much. Open to ideas, especially from women.

We quickly realized that doing everything together means that neither of us will get enough sleep. We’ve shifted to 3-5 hour shifts to give the other person uninterrupted sleep and time to shower, eat, etc.

It’s just that I miss my husband so much. We’re learning a lot about our baby from our shifts, and we come together to share and debrief. I’m thankful that we make such a great team. But I miss going to bed together and our pillow talk, I miss movie nights and cuddling on the couch, I miss having coffee together. I miss my best friend. I miss his smell. I miss his smile. It’s so silly because I know he’s just 20 steps away! 

I had an unplanned c-section and when we got home, he bought me a panic button which he holds the speaker to, so that he’ll know when I need him when we’re not in the same room. Now it’s used for the on-duty parent. I just appreciate how thoughtful he’s been.

1ickf2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1ickf2b/my_cat_is_a_nightmare_wants_attention_unless_shes/,My cat is a nightmare. Wants attention unless she's asleep.,"Howdy,

For a bit of perspective I'm nuerodiverse, I live alone with my cat who is now a bit over 3, she was adopted a little early as she was ditched at a vet, after being 'found' at a gas station.. we suspect she was 7 weeks old. 

I used to live in a fairly big place with some family but I moved to an apartment and since then her behaviour has gotten worse and worse. I'm currently not working, whilst I was working I'd go to work and come home and she'd be all loving and then go nap or whatever. 

Since I've not been working. The moment I get out of bed I'm not able to do anything for myself from about 7am-12pm until she decides it's sleep time. I cannot even sit and have a coffee before I'm getting bitten. If I sit at the computer, which is mostly what I do. She gets behind the monitor and attacks all my cables, or she goes behind the computer or under my desk etc. Everything is cable managed to the extreme but she bites and pulls everything out. If I stop her or distract her it usually results in attacking me violently. Playing with her mostly ends up on her losing interest in the toys and attacking me. She has a post at the window, we have loads of toys. I will get up and run her back and forth across the house until she can't move, so I then go continue what I was doing and it starts again. If I just sit on the couch and give up she leaves me alone. 

Once she goes to sleep I basically have to make the most of a few hours because come 7pm this whole nonsense starts again and I just go to bed eventually because she leaves me alone if I do that. It's messing with my mental health a bit because not only do I have little to do. I can't even keep myself busy in my own home as I feel like I'm in some sort of cat prison 24/7. I've tried ignoring her, it doesn't really work because she just latches onto me as hard as she can and putting her in a the other room barely works as she goes berserk and scratches the door. It's a rental. It's like if she's awake I just can't do anything. I've been on the verge of surrendering her, I've had 3 cats and my other 2 were basically Garfield and wanted nothing all day. I'm happy to play 20 minutes here and there but it doesn't change anything. I'm continually wasting entire days trying to tire her out.. what's next here..?? She's healthy, has been checked on. We tried another cat as a trial and she hated it and even after slow introductions just kept attacking him. So I don't think that's an answer even if it was possible here. Sick of living this way, my arms are so scarred now. When she's wanting to rest, she's very loving and normal..

We were together for 2.5 years, a very intense 2.5 years. 

I broke up with him, even though I did (and still do) love him immensely. I felt like I was the only one in the relationship putting in daily effort,i.e. I was always travelling to him, etc... unless I needed rescuing, then he would appear. We also wanted different things - I want to get married, live together etc,.. he's done all that and had a bad experience, so doesnt want to go there again. It all came to a head one day when I asked (no, BEGGED) for some...ahem...attention, and he gave me 2 minutes and then *gave up*... when I was always willing to give him *ahem* attention, whenever he asked.
I was really unable to voice what I felt at the time, as I know hes so sensitive, he'd take it personally; so I broke up with him. 

We are still friends, he still does shit for me, I still pop in for coffee.. really the onky thing thats changed is less pressure on me for, well, everything. 

Anyway, it didnt really register at the time, but its really hitting me now, 6 months later. 
I miss him so much. I want to be able to snuggle up on the couch and hold hands and do all that couple stuff. 

But I dont know if I want that because i actually want him back, or am I looking at the past with rose tinted glasses and just wanting some company. 
He is so calm and keeps me grounded, and now I have no one in my life like that.

We live in a TINY town (200ppl) and I'm a weird creature who barely associates with others, and in general - hates people. 
All my (very few) friends are people he introduced me to.

My usual MO is to cut and run - far far away... 
Which I havent done, so... progress 😅

1ickcjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1ickcjq/he_is_in_a_new_relationship/,He is in a new relationship,"Hi all, 

I felt I needed to get this off my chest in a community of people that would understand how I'm feeling right now. 

I made a previous post about ending a relationship with my Q who I had been with for 5 years. That was in June of last year. We ended the relationship during his active recovery when it felt like he didn't have the emotional capacity to give energy to our relationship while he was working on his recovery. 

Since then, we have been in touch over text every so often, and have met for coffee a small handful of times to catch up. We were trying to maintain a friendship. He just recently reached one year of sobriety, and he invited me to his Cake Day at AA to celebrate the one-year with me. Today was the day I was supposed to go, and we had just finalized the plans this morning. 

This evening, a couple of hours before the event, he called me to let me know that he had started seeing someone and that they would be at this event tonight and he didn't know if that would change how I felt about coming. This information shocked me and made me quite upset. He had assured me when we broke up that he needed to take the time to be single and learn who he is as a sober person. He also has recently (in the last 2 months) restarted the steps because he felt his first sponsor rushed him through them and he wanted to do it properly. That said, he has repeatedly told me that the step 9 amends would come and I have expressed that it is important for me to hear them. He shared that he has been seeing her for a couple of months and that they met in AA. 

I feel so robbed of being able to celebrate this one-year milestone with him when 5 years was spent supporting him through his addiction. It feels so hurtful that someone he has been with for 2 months gets to have that moment when I feel like it should be me. I also feel angry that he is able to move onto a new relationship before he has made his amends with me and completed his steps. 

Anyways, I calmly told him on the phone that I was glad he shared with me, but that given the circumstances, I didn't think a friendship between us would be possible at this time. I let him know that if/when he is ready to do an amends, that I may be able to receive it, so to only reach out for that reason moving forwards. I realized that trying to hold onto a friendship with him was only causing pain, and I wasn't getting any benefit from it. 

This has been a very challenging turn of events, but perhaps a piece of closure at the same time (though not the closure I was expecting).

##***Part Five: Head Of The Pack***

Back to the start we go. The new stuff is in orange, and…

 

>SCP-8822-7

 

There are three more heads. So, uh… where are they coming from? Are the heads somehow spawning them, or are people getting *turned into* heads? We’ll find out more later.

Now we see an immediate difference:

 

>Foundation staff reading this file are to be aware of the following:

>All presented details are consistent with those presented earlier.

>Do not stop reading this document. Re-read if needed.

>There are no inconsistencies. If you notice any, you are imagining it.

>Foundation staff reading this file are to notice and be aware of any transient feelings of abnormality, and allow the feeling to subside on its own terms. These feelings are considered normal.



See, that’s exactly what a bunch of heads that are altering reality around us would want us to think.

 

>All members of SCP-8822 are exceptionally beautiful compared to visually similar carvings, likely anomalously so; this has led to their notoriety as essential artwork in the Greater Manchester region of the UK and in online circles. The most dedicated fans of SCP-8822 spend their lives in service of them.

 

That last sentence is *very* important, keep it in mind for later.

Continuing on, the next significant change is that now the three-person team was sent from Site-91, not Site-199. Our new team consists of Senior Investigator Melanie West, a low-level telepath, Researcher Vikram Singh, who has some kind of neurological injury that gave him memory problems, and Researcher Sally Hawthorne, who’s proficient in memetics and countermemetics.

Our next part is Vikram’s field notes. He starts by saying this.

 

>Even on an average day, it would be a long trip from Site-91 to Bradford by road; today, the Leeds rush hour was twice as nasty as usual. Ordinarily we'd've been dispatched a little later with a hotel room booked ahead of time; this was not the case today, and an explanation had not been forthcoming. As a result, the three of us were practically exhausted before we even arrived, so Dr. West had hopped out a couple of blocks away to pick us up some coffee. Ms. Hawthorne and I arrived at The Bradford Masonry at 08:15.

 

Hmmm, almost like reality got altered around them by some heads who don’t want them to look too closely into things.

They’re met by one of the volunteers, who identifies himself only as ‘Old Bob’. He’s the only person there, but by previous agreement, he leaves and they take inventory of the masonry’s contents:

 

>Seven stone heads, arranged by Old Bob in a row on the shop counter

>SCP-8822-1: Male portrait, limestone, heavily weathered

>SCP-8822-2: Female portrait, limestone, heavily weathered

>SCP-8822-3: Male portrait, marble, heavily weathered

>SCP-8822-4: Male carving, limestone, very heavily weathered

>SCP-8822-5: Male portrait, marble, lightly weathered

>SCP-8822-6: Male portrait, marble, lightly weathered

>SCP-8822-7: Female portrait, marble, lightly weathered  

>Approximately one hundred much smaller carvings of varying quality, all bearing some resemblance to at least one of the seven heads; most are made of wood, but some of marble or limestone

 

So, three new heads. Call me suspicious, but are they Nicholas, Greg and Claire?

Now, here’s a really interesting bit. The volunteers who take care of the heads identify as a religious cult, so the team does a test of Akiva radiation- in essence, they’re measuring the ambient divine power, which you find in large amounts around gods, their devotees and places of worship. Since this is a cult and the focus of their religion is right there, you’d *think* you’d get some pretty high readings, but no, they don’t.

 

>Akiva radiation levels are barely above baseline. While it is possible the stone heads have some religious significance, it is unlikely that more than one or two people genuinely believe so.

 

Vikram isn’t impressed, but Sally is. She says that Old Bob’s presence should have made them spike- after all, he’s a cultist. Ergo, something is up here.

Melanie arrives with coffee and winds up accidentally psychically linking with the heads. We aren’t told what’s that like- instead, the team goes for a coffee break.

 

>We took the time to discuss how ""ecstatic"" we were to be investigating the famous Bradford Heads. Melanie and Sally seemed genuinely enthused at the prospect, but I'm afraid I must admit that I didn't find myself excited in the slightest. I've never been into the arts and quite honestly had never heard of these heads before today, but for their sakes I smiled and nodded and played along.

 

Gee, it’s almost like you got altered into this reality or something.

Anyway, West wants to start her psychic test, but Vikram convinces her to do a Hume test first because he doesn’t think it’s safe to jump straight to psychic testing after she got mindlinked just by walking in.

 

>Weak positive Hume discrepancy between each head and its area, indicating a lower resistance to reality bending than typical matter.

 

Gee, I wonder why.

Vikram finds Melanie staring at one of the heads and asks what she’s doing. They talk about Melanie’s predecessor’s predecessor (grand-predecessor?), a woman named Rebekah Douglas. Melanie met her once, shook her hand, and never saw her again. Afterwards, she found out that Douglas was a level-3 psychometrist, able to tell nearly everything about an object with a touch- and Melanie shook her hand. She always wondered what Douglas had seen in her. But she can’t ask, because Douglas disappeared a few years later.

Melanie doesn’t know what happened to Douglas- it was covered up. She eventually forgot about Rebekah, and then 2022 happened, when the Republic of Daevastan got brought into reality.

 

Now, I’m just going to digress for a moment. 6140 as an article is about the differences between the Daevite Empire as 140 portrayed them and the Republic of Daevastan, a perfectly normal nation that got written out of history by a fucking insane bigot. (If you haven’t read [the declass](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/pqnhk3/scp6140_the_true_empire_declassification_and/), I recommend it.) But what 8822 is focusing on is the sheer number of differences that the changed world of 6140 has as a result.

Think about it like this. Imagine two worlds: the first is our world, world A, and the second is world B. World B is exactly like our world except that there’s one more country- we’ll say it’s an extra bit of land on Spain’s right, and I’ll unashamedly borrow from [Thomas More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(book)#Interpretation) and call it Nolandia. How different do you think world B would be, with the addition of that new country and all those people? Maybe Nolandia had wars, or maybe it didn’t. Maybe they colonised countries, or maybe they didn’t. But people from Nolandia would go all over the globe, meeting people, making discoveries, spreading their culture, starting relationships, buying and selling their goods.

Maybe I or someone reading this article would be from Nolandia or have Nolandic ancestry. Maybe we’d speak Nolandic, or know a few words. Maybe we’d be rocking out to Nolandic music, or using Nolandic technology, or visiting exhibitions of Nolandic art, or reading Nolandic books. Maybe we’d be planning our next vacation in Nolandia, or reminiscing about our time there.

Or, I’ll put it like this. You’ve probably heard of the [Butterfly Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) (no, not the movie)- the idea that a butterfly flaps its wings in Africa, and the changes in the wind build up and create a hurricane in India. If that’s one butterfly, how much do you think the world would change if it was an entire fucking country?

 

Anyway, I bring this up because West is from the old world, the world before the Republic happened. She and the rest of Site-91’s senior staff came out of it unscathed, and there was Rebekah Douglas, thirty years older, a completely normal Foundation employee.

 

>Without any anomalous Daevite influence, she lived out a relatively normal life for a Foundation employee; she had a good long career, until we showed up. I don't know what happened to her after that. I think I would have transferred somewhere else.""

 

I wouldn’t blame her- can you imagine getting up, going to work, and then suddenly half of your fellow employees think you’ve been missing for thirty years, when you’ve been working with them the whole time?

(Gee, it’s almost like reality got altered or something…)

*Anyway*, the point is that West thinks that the fourth head, Clyde, looks like it could be Daevite. Singh isn’t from the old world and doesn’t have the memories of it, so he can’t say. Instead, he suggests running a thaumaturgy test…

 

>She couldn't hold back a second round of laughter, a full head-back cackle. ""Oh *man,* I wish I could. But thaumaturgy is so rare these days — we just don't have that kind of equipment lying around in this consensus. A few of the older units were brought along, but you'd have to be obsessed to keep one. Not me.""

>I frowned. ""I think you might be a little mixed up about thaumaturgy's rarity — the Coalition is very much present in this consensus. Sarkics, too.""

>""Is that so? I might have been misinformed.""

 

I feel like if I say something about reality getting altered again, I’m going to get hit with something heavy. But that does say something about Nicholas, that he’d keep his units around.

Anyway, Melanie tries psychically connecting with the heads. She forms a connection with Blinky, Pinky and Inky, but can’t detect any sapience. Clyde nearly knocks her out from exhaustion, and she’s told that she needs to go take a break. One of the cultists knocks on the door, but while Vikram wants to send him away, Sally suggests that they interview him, so they do.

The cultist, Mike, genuinely doesn’t seem that invested in what he’s doing. He says that he volunteers because his daughter’s into them, but he can’t actually remember how long he’s been volunteering for. And then there’s this.

 

>**HAWTHORNE:** We'll make sure to check it out. But if I might ask a more personal question — do you, yourself, believe in the heads?

>**BURGERMAN:** Believe in 'em? Sure, I can see them right over there, eh? Ha! Heh heh. Look… doing this gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Maybe, at the end of the day, the Heads themselves aren't that important to me. But everyone else seems to love them and it's important to support the community, right? I already told you I pretty much only do this to see my daughter happy.

>**SINGH:** She's seven — *does* it make her happy?

>**BURGERMAN:** What kind of question is that?

 

We’ll come back to this shortly.

Like the last team, the trio then go for lunch at the deli, where West asks for ideas about what to do next. Sally immediately says that the Akiva test results make no sense, because as the focal items of a cult that they know exists, the heads have to have *some* religious significance, so she wants to try again. Vikram points out that the cult itself doesn’t make sense: they have no real organisation or religious principles, not even a Facebook group. The deli might be named for the heads and have a replica on display, but nobody seems to actually care about them.

Sally adds that it’s weird that the cult calls itself a cult- normally people call *them* a cult. (I’m flashing back to *Pokemon Insurgence.)* Melanie asks if they’d heard the nursery rhyme about the Bradford Heads- she found it on Wikipedia, and thinks it’s weird that none of them have heard of it before now.

The first verse goes as follows:

 

>*Over down by Bradford way,*

>*A farmer herds her flock.*

>*Hiding 'neath the dirt she lay,*

>*A face hewn into rock.*

 

A farmer herding her flock? But wouldn’t the proper word be ‘shepherd’?

…hey, don’t we know someone with the last name Shepherd who had some involvement with the heads, but isn’t involved now? \*taps own head\*

They decide to go back and talk to Old Bob, while Melanie wants to try linking to the heads she couldn’t link to the first time.

She skips Clyde and goes to Head 5… and it works!

 

>I'm in. There's a sentience here, of a sort. It's very faint. It doesn't feel alive, but it doesn't feel dead, either. Hello? Can you hear me? I think it knows I'm here. There's an awareness, but not enough to respond. An emotion… irritation. Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, little one. I'll leave your space now.

 

So this one *is* sentient, it sensed her, and it didn’t like her being there. It’s not much, but it’s something. She compares it to Blinky, Inky and Pinky, which she says were like picking up the phone, but the person on the other side didn’t say anything, whereas Head 5 is like picking up the phone and hearing someone breathing on the end of the line. She’s about to try linking to Head 6, and then *this* happens.

 

>Melanie picked up SCP-8822-6 from the shop counter and looked into it. Sally readied the voice recorder, but Melanie broke formation.

>""I know this face.""

>""You can't know that face. That's impossible,"" I said. ""It's hundreds of years old.""

>""No, I'm sure of it. This is Dr. Carruthers from Site-199 — he *was* one of the leading experts about the Daevite Empire. We attended a seminar in Daevastan about a year ago. The way he came across, I got the impression that… well, let's just say I had reason to remember him.""

>Sally and I glanced at each other. She must have felt our doubt.

 

Welp.

That leads to the phone call where Gregory got replaced with Melanie. She reports this to Vikram, and then goes back to testing with Heads 6 and 7.

 

 

>Connected to '-6. Feels very similar to the last one: something there, but only barely. It's different, not in any specific way, it's just different — what I mean is, if there's an entity in here, this and the one in '-5 are different entities, not different facets of the same being. It knows I'm in here. I feel it feeling me right back. Hello? I don't mean to intrude. I just want to understand. I think it wants to speak to me, but it doesn't know the words. It wants to communicate but it's got nothing to say. There's guilt and jealousy in here, but it's not the almost-anger that I felt in the other head. I feel welcome, but I don't belong. Disconnecting. Moving on to '-7… and I'm in. Oh, you're a little quieter. Dimmer. Like you've had more time to fade… or maybe faded faster. This one feels a little more like the first three; it's almost empty. I'm not going to get much from this.

 

Nicholas is doing his best to talk, but he can’t get the words out. Gregory wanted her to fuck off, and Claire seems to be gone.

Melanie then gives them the verdict: there’s something in the heads, but it’s dying. Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Claire are good as gone, Greg and Nicholas need protecting, and she isn’t sure about Clyde, but she’d rather class it with the latter than the former.

 

 

>The three of us sat in the circle of chairs in the back room and discussed for over an hour. We examined every detail, every bit of evidence we'd collected so far. There was so little we knew about the heads, but even after having known them for only a few hours, I felt that I cared for them. I wanted them to survive.

 

 

Interesting.

Old Bob comes back, and they try asking him some questions about the cult. Note this answer.

 

>**'OLD BOB':** Well, it's something to do, isn't it? I saw the work the cult was doing for the community and I just knew I had to be part of it. And look at these things! They're gorgeous, no? How could you not want to be close to 'em?

 

Just wait a second.

Once they’re done, Sally says that she knows what’s killing the heads: it’s the Akiva field, or rather, the lack of one. The heads need worship to survive, but they’re not getting it. They’ve whammied hundreds of people into thinking that they worship the heads as part of a cult, but none of them *actually* worship the heads, so they’re dying. That’s why they keep going after more and more people: Melanie comments that in a cult of hundreds of people, there must be at least *one* person who actually believes, but Sally rebuts that if the heads are draining the Akiva field, that could leave a cult with no true believers. (Everyone who read *Small Gods* just went ‘Oh, right, yeah.’)

Melanie doesn’t think this is the case, pointing out that it’s a neat theory, but there’s no real evidence. She asks for Vikram’s opinion, and he says that in order to properly contain the heads, they need more information- he wants to talk to more members of the cult, or anyone who’s familiar with the heads. Melanie decides to go with Sally’s plan, which is take the heads back to Site-91 and generate some Akiva radiation for them. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work.

 

>After Dr. West's team brought SCP-8822 to Site-91, efforts were undertaken to generate an artificial Akiva field as per Researcher Hawthorne's recommendation.

>Construction of an artificial belief field was not immediately successful. Site-91 did not have the equipment or the expertise to overcome the Generation Problem and produce Akiva radiation from nothing.

>The Department of Tactical Theology was consulted for assistance. Dr. Dullahan of the Parareligions Division was dispatched to Site-91 to investigate, and following their report to the DoTT, Site-91 was ordered to cease attempting to develop Akiva production technology and destroy all progress thus far.

>SCP-8822-1, SCP-8822-2, SCP-8822-3 and SCP-8822-7 are now considered inert. Analysis of SCP-8822-5 and SCP-8822-6 is inconclusive.

>All SCP-8822 members are considered contained as of 2024-10-20.

 

Well, that’s depressing… oh, hey, the page just shifted again.

 

##***Part Six: Thinking Ahead***

Going back up to the top now shows me a very obvious change: the banner has turned purple, and we’ve gone from the SCP Foundation to the S*D*P Foundation: ‘Secure, Display, Protect’.

 

>**Spatial Demonstration Procedures:** SDP-8822 are to be displayed in art galleries and museums in the Northern England area, including Manchester, Leeds, York, Liverpool, and nearby towns and suburbs where feasible. SDP-8822 stock is to be rotated at least monthly.

>Marketing campaigns are to be run continuously to attract as many viewers to SDP-8822 exhibits as possible. Entrance fees are to be optimised to target major population cohorts as determined by the Analytics Department on a per-area basis.

 

So here’s the thing: If the heads really were dying from lack of worship, you’d think that this wouldn’t be possible. But it’s almost like some people sympathetic to the heads took them out of the masonry and to a place full of people who gave them sympathy, attention, and the ability to perceive what was in the Site. So it doesn’t seem to be worship at all. Maybe it’s something else, like… attention. And there’s something else I need to mention, but I’ll come back to it at the end of the declass.

So, the heads have now made their own Foundation with blackjack and hookers, and called it the SDP. It exists solely to display the heads around Northern England, and oddly enough, like the cult, they don’t actually seem to care about the heads that much.

 

>SDP-8822 has been a monumentally successful collection for the Foundation.

>The initial exhibit in Bradford's Cartwright Hall began slowly. The first visitors demonstrated the effectiveness of word-of-mouth marketing, based solely on the intrinsic merits of the sculptures and their overwhelming beauty, bringing in more people every day; an effect that compounded upon itself, increasing the exhibit's exposure to the public exponentially. The exhibit was met with critical success and widespread appeal. However, Bradford is a city with a relatively low population and little tourism, and the market was quickly saturated before we were able to expand.

>Fortunately, the unprecedented popularity of SDP-8822 in Bradford made the local news, and the Foundation was able to secure a lucrative contract enabling the display of SDP-8822 at other locations. See document EXPANSION STRATEGY for more information (Level 4 Clearance required).

>As a result, SDP-8822 can be nearly solely credited with expanding the reach of the Foundation from Bradford to encompass most of North England. Each exhibit sees up to 20,000 impressions per day on average, with upcoming marketing campaigns looking to increase that number further.

 

They seem to be using the heads solely as a way to expand their reach and get more money, and the people they’re displaying the heads to don’t seem to really care about them either. To confirm it, next up is an excerpt of comments from the Heads’ logbook. The majority of the ratings are five stars, but nobody actually seems to genuinely *like* the heads. There’s a lot of comments about how they don’t get it, several about being underwhelmed once they finally saw them, a couple straight up saying that they’re not worth it, and a few who admit that they’re only commenting/reviewing to get free Starbucks.

The next part is an ‘Expansion Strategy’, where the SDP talks about how they got the heads on display for more and more people.

 

>The Foundation was subsequently contacted by the Strategic Curation Panel, a business-to-business for-profit initiative with the self-stated mission of maximising the impact of art exhibitions. The Panel explained that they had extensive experience in artistic management, including of sculptures specifically, and were willing to strike a deal.

 

This is the real Foundation, who stepped in once they realised what was going on. They’ve limited displays of the heads to eight locations owned by the real Foundation, and are taking most of the money earned.

 

>Although we would like to be able to display SDP-8822 in other locations, this offer has been accepted as a cost-saving measure.

>Any renegotiations will be subject to discussion with our primary contact for and liaison to the Panel, who is currently Ms. L Shepherd.

> 

So, a couple of things to note: the first is that this is basically the real Foundation’s containment measures, which amounts to ‘give the heads what they want while limiting their ability to go further’. The second is that Lauren survived the shift because the others got moved to Bradford and she was in Salford, so she’s now working for the real Foundation and opposing the heads. Once the heads moved themselves to Bradford, they could no longer affect Lauren, who was in Salford, so she’s safe. They may not even remember who she is, given that she’s interacting with them as the SCP’s representative and not getting whammied. Croquembouche also said this:

 

*I don't think it makes much sense that she would come back to get revenge on the heads as the Panel rep, because she wouldn't remember interacting with them, but it just feels so right so I did it anyway, logic be damned.*

 

Yeah, fuck logic.

…oh, hey, the page just shifted again.

 

 

##***Part Seven: Heading For Defeat***

Back up at the top, there’s now 55 heads, and they’re known throughout Britain. So much for that attempt to contain them to Northern England. The logbook hasn’t changed, but at the end of the Expansion Strategy, we’re told this.

 

>We intend to eventually display the entire SDP-8822 collection simultaneously, so this offer was accepted with the proviso that we would be allowed to display more SDP-8822 exhibits in additional locations as we acquire them, an amendment to which the Panel was reluctantly forced to agree.

 

Wait, more exhibits?

Yep, page shifted again. Back at the top of the page, there’s now *621* heads. And… it looks like that’s it. It’s just going to be more and more heads, forever. The page picture has even changed to a photo of a bunch of stone heads in a box, and they’re not being cared for, they’re just dumped in there irreverently.



So, with that, who wants to know what’s going on here? I knew you would. 

I wrote most of this before I learned this particular fact, so I wasn’t actively trying to deceive you all, but it turned out like that by sheer accident: to whit, up until now, it seemed apparent that the heads were behind all this. But remember that phrasing from the start?



>One or more of the four stone heads changes descriptions of itself to be inaccurate. It is not clear at this time which specifically; regardless, nonspecific descriptions of the full set of heads appear to be safe from the effect. Therefore, all SCP-8822 members are to be treated identically and interaction is to be minimised. 



It’s not the heads, it’s one head in particular. (After all, it’s ‘Alethophobia: Headcanon’, not ‘Alethophobia: *Heads*canon’.) A head made of a different kind of stone from the others, a head with an obviously different design, a head who exhausted a psychic who tried to link with it, almost like it didn’t want anyone finding out anything about it. A head who all the other heads follow- Croquembouche pointed out to me that the photos of the heads change so that if our ringleader is looking at you, the others are all looking at you too.

In other words, Clyde. It was always Clyde. (Dun dun *dun!*)

(Also, I intended the Pac-Man reference to stand by itself, but I’ve been typing ‘Clyde’ so many times that I have to reference [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33-vyuHjoWQ) now.)

So, what *is* Clyde? Well, I can’t tell you exactly. What I *can* tell you is that it’s some kind of entity that either inhabits the head or took the form of the head. It’s been around for a long time, possibly even longer than we know, and it can do multiple things: retroactively alter reality, create new heads, turn people into heads, and one other thing I’ll get to shortly.

See, Sally was wrong: the heads aren’t divine and feeding off Akiva radiation. Instead, Clyde feeds off *attention*. But what it does is find someone it can manipulate/use and changes itself to be what they want it to be, and it reinforces their belief.

So, for instance: why is Clyde a statue? Because it started out in a masonry, and that’s what the owner wanted- statues to sell. Why is Clyde old? Because old, historical objects are more valuable. Nicholas wanted a Daevite artefact to restore his reputation and prestige, so Clyde became a ‘Daevite artefact’ despite being made of limestone, which isn’t in Daevastan. (Note that Melanie thought that Clyde looked a ‘little’ Daevite- she wasn’t instantly convinced. And Nicholas decided that *all* of the heads were Daevite even though Blinky, Pinky and Inky look so different from Clyde, for a reason we’ll get to shortly.) Melanie saw the heads as something to protect and help, so she didn’t bother trying to do more investigating, she went straight to ‘give them Akiva radiation to eat’ and didn’t actually contain them, thus letting Clyde see the Foundation and what it did.

But TED, I hear some of you thinking. The heads were sitting in the masonry for years with nobody looking at them. What did Clyde eat? Well, attentive readers, consider this: we don’t know where Blinky, Pinky and Inky came from. One of them is almost certainly the unnamed employee, but given the sheer number of heads that turn up later, either Clyde is spawning off heads that were never people en masse, or Clyde was mass-converting people into heads. And Nicholas, Greg and Claire were dying almost instantly after they got turned… because Clyde’s eating them. That’s why Blinky, Pinky and Inky were nearly empty, because Clyde’s been munching on them for years.

Clyde started out by making the cult, which gave the heads some attention, but I’m guessing that it overheard the Site-91 team’s comments about how nobody in the cult gave a shit about them, so it turned itself and the other heads into art objects. Make them famous enough and prestigious enough and plenty of people will go see them just because they exist. Even if the tourists don’t give a shit and only want the free Starbucks, they’re still giving Clyde attention. (One of the many stories my parents have to tell about tourists is about them going to the Louvre and seeing crowds of tourists flocking around the *Mona Lisa* and practically fighting each other to get good photos of it, while completely ignoring the other masterpieces around it.)

But Clyde fucked up. 55 heads is manageable- displayed in eight places in Northern England, that’s six or seven heads per place. Perfectly fine. But *over six hundred heads?* Nobody can display that many heads, and nobody’s crazy enough to want to see them all. So they’ll rotate the heads, and Clyde is probably in a warehouse or a box somewhere with nobody looking at it. Maybe it’s surrounded by the batteries it made, but without anyone to give it attention, or maybe it’s surrounded by its lifeless, inert children. But either way, it’s not having a good time right now.

That being said, what we don’t know is what happens next. Maybe Clyde decides to go back to having 50 heads so it can be on display. Maybe it runs out of power. Maybe Shepherd figures it out and smashes the shit out of Clyde, or throws it into a deep pit somewhere, I don’t know. That’s another story.



So, with all of that done, there’s one more question: why alethophobia? Why a fear of the truth (and memories), including an unwillingness to accept facts you don’t like? Well, in order to answer that, here is another question: what *is* truth?

Here are two answers for you:

 

*‘that which is true or in accordance with fact or reality.’*

*‘a fact or belief that is accepted as true.’*

 

Throughout this article and this declass, we’ve seen that what we call fact or reality is not concrete. In the right hands, it’s very mutable. 6140 changed reality and the truth by fitting Daevastan into it, and Clyde kept changing reality and the truth by increasing the number of heads and their importance. As such, what we can see here is a number of events *in response to* a fear of the truth (and memories):

 

\-Sir Thomas Bruce, the man who wrote SCP-140, didn’t like that Daevastan was a peaceful, normal nation with a dark, bloody history who overcame that history and developed into an ordinary, modern nation. So he created a new ‘truth’- that they were a bloodthirsty empire of atrocities and destruction- and imposed it on Daevastan, writing it out of history.

\-Once they came back, the Daevastanis were afraid that the Foundation was going to be so adamant that the old truth was still the truth, relying on those old memories, that they’d react as they saw appropriate for it and wipe them out of existence.

\-Nicholas was afraid of the truth because his old truth had him as a Daevite expert, and now he’s merely proficient regarding the *new* truth that replaced it. Now his new truth has him as a small fish in a big pond and he doesn’t like it, so he clung to the first thing that he thought could help change that, and look where it got him. 

\-Lauren was afraid that the truth was that the heads were whammying them and altering their memories and that everything was spinning out of control, and she was right. Whether she can do anything about it is a whole other question.

\-Melanie was afraid that the truth was that the heads were dying. It was, but she had the wrong facts and wasn’t in a position to help them. Whether she’s still working for the Foundation or got turned into a head herself for trying to help them, who knows? 

\-Clyde was afraid that the truth was going to be that it would die alone in the masonry with its depleted batteries. Then it became afraid that the Foundation would figure it out and contain it, so it changed the truth accordingly and wound up screwing itself over by accident. Whoops.

\-The Foundation is afraid of a reality where the truth is that the heads can’t be stopped, and they’re trying to act accordingly too.

\-As Croquembouche pointed out, the article itself is afraid of the truth, and changes over and over to fit whatever reality works best.

 

And that’s SCP-8822, a story about how one should always stop and consider things carefully before jumping into any endeavour, lest you end up as a stone head getting drained by a reality-warping sort-of-cannibal. Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it. Go visit an art gallery when you get the chance. I’ll see you next time.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Also, he’s tall and cute—points in his favor.  The little I know about him—from our conversations and (I regret to admit) his LinkedIn—tells me that he’s godly, smart, kind, humble, and maybe more confident than his reserved demeanor would indicate. 

He’s a bit shy, and I noticed he stutters. After interacting with him a few times and observing how he interacts with others, I’ve noticed he seems to stutter more around me.   I laughed once when he got really stuck on a word (he was flustered and it was kind of endearing and funny).   I quickly apologized, but I still worry that it might have embarrassed him.

I’d like to get to know him better. I’m interested in him (whether as a friend or more), but I don’t want to rush things or lead him on.  I want to be mindful of how he might feel about his stutter—he seems a little self-conscious about it. I want him to feel comfortable around me and to know I don’t judge him for it, but I also don’t want to make things weird.  I have ADHD and anxiety, so I understand how it feels to be different.

So anyway:

* How can I approach him in a way that feels natural and comfortable?
* How can I make him feel at ease and show that I genuinely want to get to know him as a person without it feeling forced or awkward?

I really just want to be his friend and make sure he feels safe around me, whether this turns into something more or not.

1ick1we,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1ick1we/help_choosing_the_right_delonghi/,Help Choosing the right Delonghi,"Getting pretty close to buying myself my first superautomatic.  I was originally looking at the Magnifica Evo ([ECAM29043SB](https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/magnifica-evo-espresso-machine-ecam29043sb/p/ECAM29043SB?_gl=1*x5liir*_up*MQ)) with steam wand.  But then saw the Magnifica Start ([ECAM22022B](https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/magnifica-start-espresso-machine-with-manual-milk-frother/p/ECAM22022B?_gl=1*x5liir*_up*MQ)).  It seems to be $150 less for basically the same features, which confused me.  Besides appearance, it seems like the only difference is that the Evo makes ""Long"", which as I understand it is similar to Americano.  So my first question is, am I missing something?  Is there another reason to spend $150 more on the Evo that I'm just not seeing?

  
My second question is mostly subjective, but I'd be interested in people's opinions.  Will I regret not paying $150 more, on either model, for the automated milk system (Latte Crema system)?  On a daily basis, I really only see myself drinking Americano/Coffee in the morning.

1ick1jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ick1jn/my_final_act_of_love_is_leaving_you_alone/,My final act of love is leaving you alone.,"
A whole year of loving you wasn’t enough. However, I understand now. You pleaded and begged for me to leave you alone. For me to change and yet you never gained anything from it. I have been thinking all day of what to write and now I find myself crying listening to our favorite music together. I cry and hurt as I write this. 

My person who was a part of my daily routine, spending 24/7 together, all the laughs, and all the arguments. The good and the bad are all just a memory that I will forever cherish in my heart. Maybe one day it won’t hurt as much as it does now. I feel as if my heart has been pulled out of my heart. 

My final act of love is giving you what you wanted from the first time I hurt you. I understand now I need to leave you alone and let you heal. You didn’t deserve anything of what I put you through and you don’t deserve to be here with me. I need to allow you to heal 

You always told me “take initiative for once.” Now here I am taking your advice. I am taking the initiative of leaving you alone because you weren’t able to walk away. I will hurt so deeply and I hope that gives you the satisfactory of knowing that I am scared of being alone. I am so fucking terrified. You were my person and a part of my daily routine for the past year. I really don’t know how I’m going to do it but I know that we will both be okay. For once I am choosing to stop being so selfish by keeping you here when I know you can be loved better. A love that will heal everything in you. I’m so sorry I wasn’t able to provide that for you. You asked me to post you and yet I took it down 3 different times because I wasn’t comfortable with it. I’m sorry that it made me anxious and I couldn’t give that to you. Im sorry it was a boundary that I have never posted someone on my Instagram feed. I really wanted to give you the world but I felt short yet once again. You said “why must you force your way back into my life only to disappoint me? Why can’t you just let me move on? ” And that was when I understood.  I can’t keep hurting you. I have hurt you enough and I need to fucking stop. 

Now instead of making meal preps for 2 it will be for 1. Instead of thinking what to get you from the grocery store I will now just be thinking of what I need for my apartment. Instead of washing for 2 I will be washing for 1. Instead of sleeping in your bed together I will be sleeping in my own bed alone. No more in n out runs. No more drinking buddies. No more playing guitar. No more house (our favorite show). No more showers together and spitting water at each other. No more making jokes. No more packing your lunch. No more me making your coffee in the mornings. I am now left with nothing and an empty feeling. 

I feel as if my whole life has been flipped and now I need to learn to be independent and alone again. I think that’s what scares me the most. I worry about you as well. I will think of you through everything that I do but I know that you need me to leave you alone. 

You said it yourself you tried to leave several times but I kept pulling you back with false promises. I need to let you move on and that is the hard reality that I need to face. My last act of love is leaving you alone for your own good. Let you find the one you’ve been looking for. I am so sorry I couldn’t be enough for you. I hope my absence gives you the peace my presence could never give you. I am respecting your decision. I wish the best for you in the future and I hope you heal everything inside of you. I am grateful I was able to learn and be loved by you. Thank you.

I am planning a tabletop game meetup at my work, and I am looking for bars or coffee shops where I can have it. A friend of mine used to host gaming meetups at Illumilatte, and while that place was the perfect venue for playing tabletop games, it unfortunately got closed down. My ideal place would not only have good food and drinks but also tables big enough to accommodate a decent sized board and space for  pieces/cards. It doesn't have to be huge like wargaming tables for Warhammer 40K, but it can't really be tiny coffee tables.   
  
And while I am familiar with Meepleville and like that business, ideally I am looking for a place where my coworkers don't have to worry about a cover charge and only need to pay for food and drink. And since I am bringing and teaching the games myself, we wouldn't be utilizing any of Meepleville's games (which is where the cover charge goes mostly towards.)

I truly benefited from each and every comment, and I felt so empowered reading your perspectives.

I couldn’t sleep last night thinking about what to say to my husband. He usually wakes up around 5 AM to go to the gym and have his coffee in peace before the kids wake up, so I decided to wake up with him (hello, headache all day!).

I told him that I was completely shocked when he asked me to sign this document—especially since he was actually okay with me signing it. I asked him, How can you say I’m not entitled to anything? I work my ass off from 9 to 5, then come home to cook, take care of the kids, and handle bedtime. And at the end of the month, I don’t see a penny—everything goes to the bills. Sure, he pays for our trips, clothes, and gifts, but I never ask for anything or tell him what to buy me.

Then I brought up religion. I told him, If you want to talk about religion, let’s be fair about it. Islamically, my money is my own, and you’re not supposed to use it. If that’s the case, I want every dollar I earned back—around $300K for the five years I worked.

I also told him that if he really wants me to sign, I will—but with my own lawyer. Because apparently, I’ve been too naïve and should have known better.

Finally, I told him that we were supposed to be saving together, but now he’s saying that in case of divorce, I get nothing? So what was all my hard work for?

At one point, I got really emotional and started crying because I was genuinely hurt that he thought this was okay. That’s when he hugged me, apologized, and promised he wouldn’t ask me to sign anything. He even said he’s willing to put half of everything in my name right now—just not the controlling rights and whatnot.

I still have a lot to process, and the meeting with the account who suggested this in the first place but at least for  I feel heard. Thank you all again for your support!

My friend got engaged in September of 2022 to her fiance who I don't know super well. Him and I have talked on several occasions over the phone and over text but only met once. The texts and call were all with he knowledge and she even encouraged it. Her and I were pretty close in high school and then she moved really far away where she met her fiance. Anytime she came to visit i would see her and take her out for coffee or dinner and talked the night away! I wouldve come to visit her but she lived on the other end of the cpuntry and school didnt allow it. Anyway, before she even publicly announced her engagement, she told me and asked me to be a bridesmaid! Of course I said yes and we talked wedding stuff occasionally throughout the years. 
Recently she's been going through it, I reached out often to check on her and also talk about the wedding plans. She picked me out a dress which I loved and I was just so excited. One day I realize I haven't heard from her in a while so I message her on Instagram. After a few days with no response, I get worried. I texted her, looked her up everywhere, called her, texted her bf and eventually called him to get a hold of her. I asked him if she was okay and if she blocked me? He said he wasn't sure but he would check with her. She messaged me ""sorry I blocked you"" and I responded with ""it's okay, are you okay""?? We talked for a few hours and then again talked wedding planning. This was like December of last year. Then this year since the wedding is in September, I asked her if I needed to be there for anything before the wedding day? She said ""oh, I've been meaning to talk about that. 
 I decided to have another friend be a bridesmaid instead of you, it is an agreement with fiance, he just doesn’t understand you like I do and we had to compromise. I’m sorry.""

Obviously I was hurt and said I was sad to not be a bridesmaid but wanted to be there to support her. Then she said

 It’s not that we don’t want you to come but I’ve gotten closer with other people here and it makes more sense to hang out with people he and I know and not people I just know. It is my decision, but it was also a compromise.
I do still want you there to celebrate but if you don't want to go anymore, I understand.

What do I do? Do I still go even if  I'm not a bridesmaid because she replaced me?

1icjl8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1icjl8k/help_my_dishes_are_still_soapy/,Help! My dishes are still soapy,"Hi, 
I’m a newly wed and moved to a new state with my husband. 
I’ve been washing dishes recently and started to noticed that the dishes/pans still have soap residue after I’ve rinse them off entirely. I first noticed when I was making pasta, I left water to boil in my stainless steel pot and add salt to the water and it caused it to sizzle instantly and make the water foggy. I didn’t think too much of it since I figured it was due to the salt and boiling water. Then, I add my pasta and as soon as I add it and mix it for a few minutes I noticed the spoon has soap residue on it. I check the pasta and can confirm there were rainbow bubbles in the water. I started noticing soap residue more and more on my dishes, I was making coffee from my keurig and once the coffee finished pouring I saw the rainbow bubbles in the mug.

My theory is that this is due to hard water, I’ve never had this issue back in our home state. Also maybe I’m not rinsing hard enough than I should be, maybe I need a tool to help me rinse out my dishes/stainless steel pans but this is frustrating.

If this is due to hard water what will be the best way to deal with this, preferably budget friendly.

I’m still very new at cleaning a kitchen, so maybe it’s me but please any suggestions on how to clean dishes maybe? lol but I’m rinsing to the point where the dishes make the squeaky noises lol :) thank you for reading!

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We are currently in Las Vegas and looking to move somewhere that is still warm but closer to some family. We are originally from the Midwest ( MN & OH) and preferred the edges of big to mid sized cities. Our goal would be to have a house and a little land 1 acre+ for under 300k with a goal of growing lots of our own food and having space to do our own thing.

We make about $100k combined a year and his job is available to go remote but I would be getting a new job hopefully as I am grossly underpaid in the nonprofit world.

We don’t have kids or plans for any currently and are used to pretty purple areas politically. 

We love being hiking and exploring nature as well as trying local coffee shops and restaurants. Coming from Vegas we don’t need anything close to the night life here but something would be nice.

We have been looking at Charlotte & Raleigh, Huntsville, or Louisville & Lexington based off of where our family is but we would love some suggestions!

I just wanted to share my latest app for flocating coffee shops anywhere in the world. I built it as a part of a December hackathon to build an app and have it on the stores in under a month. Where's the Beans? was my submission, and it has really taken off! You can instantly see the closest coffee shops, search on the map, or search by city anywhere in the world. Once you visit a shop, you can generate a custom stamp and save it to your collection. These images use the Dalle image generation API. Very soon they will have the background removed using the ML Subject segmentation built into android.

Let me know what you think of the app!
I love seeing all the new shops people generate stamps for.

1icjaju,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1icjaju/a_hungry_girls_guide_to_not_being_hungry_all_the/,A hungry girl's guide to not being hungry all the GD time.,"I keep seeing posts about how to manage hunger from people starting out, so I thought I would write down my tips as someone who LOVES food and is always hungry. I've been on this journey for about 8 months now, and things are going great, but damn - this shit is hard! 

1. First is accepting that you will be hungry. There is just no way around it. However, I found that I select a part of my day to be hungry. For me it's the morning. I know I'm gonna be super hungry from 8am-noon. For some reason it helps ""Scheduling"" my hunger. So I will eat a very small breakfast of 100cal (an egg and a mushroom) and just deal until lunch. 

2. Everyone advises to eat a shit ton of veg and fruits... sure, but this just cant fill me up. (Also, I only really like lots of raw veg in the summer) However, if I add just 15-20g of a nice fancy cheese to an apple, the fats and protein help me feel way more satiated and it only adds about 30 extra calories. 

3. Glucose spikes mess me up and make me feel way more hungry than I am. The Glucose Goddess is awesome for her 4 rules. And I can honestly say, they work: Do 10 mins of exercise after a meal, eat a savoury breakfast, eat your carbs with protein and fats, eat the fiber first on your plate. 

4. Home cooking. I have an Italian Sausage Soup recipe that I make and it's 150 - 200cal per bowl. And it's FILLING. I bake these muffins that are great treats, and when I compare calories to a muffin in a coffee shop it's crazy. Mine are 180cal per muffin, the coffee shops is 450cal!! I can literally eat 2× the food and still be winning. I cook EVERYTHING. I eat out about 1-2 times per month. (I used to eat out a lot. It's a big change, but ultimately worth it, especially if you're a big ol foodie girl like me and want to eat an entire wheel of cheese) 

5. When life gets really tough, just accept that you gotta eat your maintenance for a couple days. The rest from hunger will help you not get burnt out. 

6. Weirdly a really hard one: Just stop eating chips. Like no chips. Or other little munchie things. Eat a snack that has a real beginning and end.

7. Beans. I got into buying dried beans and not only is it crazy cheap, but also super filling. I traded out pasta for beans and I'm so into it. 

8. Everytime you have a meal or snack, drink water. Wait 20 mins at least before gauging your hunger.

9. My final tip: Be really busy. Like start a hobby. Something that keeps your hands and mind focused. Knitting, drawing, any kind of crafting, cycling, hiking, whatever. The more you're doing during the day, the less you will be thinking about eating. Or even if you are hungry, it helps you not ruminate on it, and keeps your hands out of the snacks. 

These are things that worked well for me! If you guys have any other tips I wanna hear them cause hunger is something I really struggle with, and I'm always curious what weird quirks work for other people. :)
