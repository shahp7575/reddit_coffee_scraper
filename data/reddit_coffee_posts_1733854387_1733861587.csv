1hbaymc,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hbaymc/any_way_to_improve_the_espresso_shot/,Any way to improve the espresso shot?,"I recently picked up a Delonghi Mag Evo. Didn't know what coffee to use and saw Lavazza espresso Italiano whole bean recommended so I figured I'd give it a shot. I've been making latte's for two weeks and have been quite happy with the results.

However, I feel like the espresso shot could be improved. From what I gather, you want a nice steady flow that's a nut color and the whole process should take about 20 seconds. I'm using max bean amount (3) and max temp. 

On grind setting 4.5 it dispenses unevenly, often in drips and takes 30 seconds. Color is mostly black coming out with little crema. On grind setting 5 it flows consistently with no drips. However, it initially comes out black and after a few seconds turns to a nut color. It's also done in 12-13 seconds. While this is what I'm using and tastes pretty good (to my uneducated palate), it doesn't seem to be hitting the sweet spot?

Is there anything else I can try? A grind setting between 4.5 and 5 would seem ideal but that obviously is not an option. It feels like the only thing I can do is try a different bean and continue experimenting. Maybe I'm just over thinking it and should be happy with the 5 setting since it looks and tastes pretty good anyways? ",1,1733861390.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Honestly, I wouldn't believe it either if it didn't happen to me. So, if you can't believe it, then just pretend and give me advice anyway like I'm a real person. Because I am.

I (32M) met Sarah (30F) in grade school in our small town. She was my first everything—girlfriend, love, and eventually wife. We both went to college together, and after I graduated, we got married when I was 23, and she was 21. Sarah was still finishing her degree, and I worked hard to support both of us while she completed her studies.

When she got her first job, I was so proud of her. It felt like all our sacrifices and hard work were paying off, and I thought we were on our way to building a life together. For two years, everything seemed fine—or at least, I thought so.

Then one day, I came home from work and found her packing a bag.

She sat me down and told me she had been having an affair with a coworker. I was completely oblivious. She was crying and apologetic. She said she loved me but she was ""in love"" with the coworker and they had this chemistry and a deep connection and that she never felt this level of excitement and attachment with me.

At the same time, she seemed to be really apologetic and acted very guilty. She moved in with the coworker that night.

Sarah made the divorce as quick and easy as possible. She didn’t contest anything and took almost nothing. In the state we lived in, you can get a divorce in 10 days if there aren't any children involved. We filed the papers ourselves, no lawyer (couldn't afford one).

After it was final, she asked if we could be friends, and I'm ashamed to say that I just broke down and sobbed like a baby in front of her, said nothing, and left. At that point, she was 23, and I was 25.

A couple of years later, in early 2020, while riding out Covid in my hometown, my mom casually mentioned that Sarah had married the guy she left me for. Apparently, Sarah’s parents and mine had talked about it since they’re longtime friends, and Sarah’s parents were hesitant about the marriage but supported her.

Hearing that stung. I had done everything I could to move on, but knowing she had married her affair partner felt like reopening the wound. I told my mom, as kindly as I could, that I didn’t want to hear about Sarah anymore. She understood and never brought her up again.

I was broken and depressed at first, but I went to see a therapist and got on some meds. I got some certifications and, through a friend from college, I got an interview with a global consulting company. My friend was married and couldn't do the amount of travel that the job required, so he pushed hard for me for the position. I started traveling around the world and pretty much worked all the time at first. On any given day, I was either in the gym, working, or having a virtual therapy session at 3 AM. I was a dull boy. I got into incredible shape thanks to lifting and running. Eventually, I got a long-term project in Romania and was able to meet and have relationships with women.

Fast forward a few years. Recently, I had a few weeks of vacation saved up, and I wanted to spend Christmas in Reykjavik, Iceland. I went to my parents’ place in my hometown for Thanksgiving with my sister and brother.

Last Thursday, I was at the local independent drug store in what passes for ""downtown"" in my hometown. It has a lunch counter like an old-fashioned drug store. I got a cup of coffee and sat down at the counter drinking it when Sarah sat down beside me and said hello. She was super nervous and red in the face. I was shocked and just sat there looking at her. I was exploding inside, but I kept my cool outwardly.

She was still beautiful. She was actually very fit herself and had lost her baby face and became maybe even more beautiful. She started off by apologizing for the way she ended our marriage. I told her she already apologized like 100 times when she dumped me, but she insisted that she was young and stupid, and over time she realized how much she had hurt me. She wanted to meet me later in a less crowded spot with fewer ""spies"" (small town, remember?).

I shook my head no and told her frankly that I didn't see what I could possibly get out of meeting with her again. That kind of took the wind out of her sails, and she kind of deflated. She admitted that it was probably more for her than for me. She said that I'd get closure not only for how she ended things but for the kind of person she was back then. She wanted to tell me about how she'd changed and what she'd learned about herself and what real love is. She wanted me to see that the person she became is someone that I could respect and maybe be friends with again.

I wanted to get the hell out of there, so I just told her I'd think about it. She gave me her number, and I went home. Apparently, my mother and sister had already heard about it from Sarah's mom. So I'm a big dumb victim of some kind of big dumb Hallmark Christmas movie hit job. My sister (29F) and mom (55F) told me that they kept up with Sarah since our divorce and they know that she's changed and that I should hear her out. My dad (56M) just shook his head and walked off. My brother (22M) thought all of this was hilarious. I asked if he wanted to chime in, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said that since Sarah and I knew each other from when we were kids, I should at least hear her out just to keep the peace between our families since we live in a small town.

Personally, I do think that her family would feel insulted if I didn't at least talk with her. I know for a fact that she's living with her parents now, so it seems like her life completely sh!t the bed. I'd kind of like to get the gory details as maybe a form of schadenfreude, but it's all behind me now, and I think it would all just make me sad.

I guess I'm a better man now that I'm more mature, more wealthy, and fitter than I was when I was with her, but I'm still the same guy that she didn't have chemistry or connection with back in the day. So I think whatever comes out of her mouth would be bullsh!t. I think she's probably a dragon cosplaying as a princess and wants me to be her white knight. F@#$k that.

My mom and sister are pushing hard for me to meet her, and my mom says that she's afraid if I don't at least hear Sarah out, that Sarah's mom will resent her and make her social life more complicated.

Let me make it clear that I have no intention of getting back with Sarah. Sarah is very beautiful, but so are the women of Romania, Iceland, and elsewhere. And they have the added bonus of not breaking my heart.

I'm interested in going just to hear about what happened to her after she dumped me and to smooth things over for my folks.

1hbas2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hbas2s/manipulating_the_manipulator/,Manipulating the manipulator,"So my text will start with simple question; what would you have done if you had faced a person who is a good manipulator? I've rephrasized this statement in 3rd conditional on purpose, simply because these people are very rare.

So to begin with my story. On college I met one specific girl, for the sake of privacy let's call her Karen. At the first she seemed to be just a normal girl but soon I found out her real persona.

I started hanging out with her often (this proved to be fatal mistake). Soon she started with simply being nice and she was really trying to build up a character, I'll give her that. After a while she started to ask for favors, nothing special in particular, like 'can you watch this video I sent you?', things like that. Favors by the time being became higher and higher to the point where she framed these requests and favors as something I have to do because I would look nice and such. To be clear, I stated to her that I like my own style, that her 'requests' don't make any sense. Then she apologized and I thought she would stopped. Oh boy, I was so wrong.

She gave herself an efforts and during all these meetings with her I started testing her with subtle things, i.e. mirroring her actions, she certainly didn't like that. This confirmed my theory she manipulates me. Also to not forget, she is bisexual, this isn't problem at all but during our conversations she always tries to tell me I should comment every guy and girl, even though I don't do that. It's childish thing to do. She also gaslights a lot, i.e. I tell her a joke and then she frames me how that joke is hurting her. She also told me other day how she wants to know everything I do. I'll give you an example for the last one; after class I went to the coffee with other friends. There were also one girl who lived near university and she mentioned how she has a lot of homework and we can all go to her place but she bragged to everyone how she would be ashamed if anyone of us sees her messy apartment. We said that we don't mind it. Then we all went to her. Later, Karen found out I was in that apartment, doing and helping with the homework and she accused me of being ride because I violated privacy of the girl who offered us to go to her apartment. I said how we all agreed on that. Karen told me how her telling us that her apartment is messy was sorta a message to me that I'm not welcomed. Little detail: she didn't specifically said it to me but rather the whole group. So Karen is distorting a facts. Nothing new.

Little did she know that I can also be a good manipulator, why I know that? Simply because I'm smart, I was reading all that before and I know this stuff. My current plan is to try presenting her to the others how she is mean and bad using the stealth method. Which is all about doing it secretly, in my case, initiating topics that will encourage conflicted opinions etc. Basically divide and conquer method. So far it's going good.

Tell me your opinions on this.

Hello, I’m a 22yo Moroccan female, and I want to share something that happened to me recently. On this day, I was just enjoying some time by myself. I went shopping, picked up some makeup, bought a few gifts for myself, and had a nice meal at a fancy restaurant. Afterward, I decided to relax at a café, sip coffee, and watch Netflix.

While I was there, a man (a Saudi tourist) approached me. At first, I didn’t really want to talk to anyone, but he came over and asked if he could sit with me. I agreed since I was a bit bored, and we chatted for a while. I spoke to him respectfully, and during the conversation, I mentioned that I speak five languages and that I’m very well-educated. I made it clear that I’m a master’s student, and I took pride in explaining how much I value education.

But then, as we continued talking, he suddenly asked if I wanted to go home with him for money. I was caught off guard and honestly felt really disrespected. After everything I just told him about how educated I am and how smart I am, he still assumed I was just a woman who could be bought. I couldn’t believe it, and I thought to myself, “This guy is really dumb.” I realized I had to teach him a lesson show him that not every Moroccan woman is a “wh ore” like he seemed to think.

So, when he invited me to his apartment, I decided to play along and manipulate him a bit. I told him I needed money in advance to go home, take a shower, and change my clothes before I came back to his apartment. He actually believed me.

He offered me 1,000 Moroccan dirhams, but I told him I’d need 500 upfront. Instead, he gave me 300 dirhams. Once I had the money, I went home and blocked him. I didn’t feel like I owed him anything, especially after the way he was treating me.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. Part of me thinks he deserved it, because he assumed he could buy me, but another part wonders if I did something wrong. I don’t plan to do anything like this again because it’s not in my values to take money from anyone. I don’t need money, and I don’t do those things. It was just a moment of boredom, but I’ll never do it again.

That said, I feel like he deserved it. When we first talked, I was polite and told him about myself—like how I’m well-educated and speak five languages. I gave him a decent impression of who I am. But then he judged me as if I was a whore just because I’m Moroccan, thinking every Moroccan girl is a “bitch.” That’s why I felt he needed to learn a lesson. He thought he could treat me however he wanted, and I wanted him to realize how wrong and disrespectful his assumptions were.

so ive been dissociating most of every single days for weeks, but lately its been worse. Apart from the fact that Im simply not There, I keep imagining things. Like, I keep believing that I do things when I dont. 

For example, today I convinced myself that Id done an assignment when I didnt. And by that I mean that I literally remember doing it and writing it, but I know that I didnt, because Ive just opened my folder and theres literally barely anything written on my paper. 
Likewise, yesterday I convinced myself that Id applied for an university, that id done all the steps to get in, when I didnt. I havent done it at all. I dont even know how i imagined that I did because I dont have the school report I need to apply yet. 
Last week I stopped to get coffee and work at someplace, then I blinked and two hours had passed and I was sitting in a parc 3km away. 


Anyways, the point of this post is to ask if anyones ever been through similar experiences, and if anyone has tips to just, be more present in my life.",1,1733860902.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

""The second amendment means I am my own chief executive and commander in chief of my own military. I authorize my own act of self-defense in response to a hostile entity making war on me and my family.

Nelson Mandela says no form of violence can be excused. Camus says it’s all the same, whether you live or die or have a cup of coffee. MLK says violence never brings permanent peace. Gandhi says that non-violence is the mightiest power available to mankind.

That’s who they tell you are heroes. That’s who our revolutionaries are.

Yet is that not capitalistic? Non-violence keeps the system working at full speed ahead.

What did it get us. Look in the mirror.

They want us to be non-violent, so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us.

The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive. You have to decide what you will tolerate.

In *Gladiator 1* Maximus cuts into the military tattoo that identifies him as part of the roman legion. His friend asks, “Is that the sign of your god?” As Maximus carves deeper into his own flesh, as his own blood drips down his skin, Maximus smiles and nods yes. The tattoo represents the emperor, who is God. The god emperor has made himself part of Maximus’s own flesh. The only way to destroy the emperor is to destroy himself. Maximus smiles through the pain because he knows it is worth it.

These might be my last words. I don’t know when they will come for me. I will resist them at any cost. That’s why I smile through the pain.

They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was forty-one years old. She said it started ten years before that with burning sensations in her feet and occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later.

The first time the pain came she ignored it. Then it came a couple times a year and she ignored it. Then every couple months. Then a couple times a month. Then a couple times a week. At that point by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start, and the discomfort was constant. At that point even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor

She started with ibuprofen, until the stomach aches and acid reflux made her switch to acetaminophen. Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back to ibuprofen.

The first doctor said it was psychosomatic. Nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more.

The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine. She needed back surgery. It would cost $180,000. Recovery would be six months minimum before walking again. Twelve months for full potential recovery, and she would never lift more than ten pounds of weight again.

The third doctor performed a Nerve Conduction Study, Electromyography, MRI, and blood tests. Each test costs $800 to $1200. She hit the $6000 deductible of her UnitedHealthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation, and my mother wasn’t able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset.

The tests showed severe neuropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have had no effect.

They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn’t tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years, when she drove me to Monterey to go to the aquarium. I saw an otter in real life, swimming on its back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four-hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her MORE sensitive to pain, and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two or three hours.

Then gabapentin. By now the pain was so bad she couldn’t exercise, which compounded the weight gain from the slowed metabolic rate and hormonal shifts. And it barely helped the pain, and made her so fatigued she would go an entire day without getting out of bed.

Then Corticosteroids. Which didn’t even work.

The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up in the night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she’s OK. Eventually I stopped getting up. She’d yell out anguished shrieks of wordless pain or the word “fuck” stretched and distended to its limits. I’d turn over and go back to sleep.

All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, and more imagine scans. Each appointment was promised to be fully covered, until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother’s suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society.

My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were immersed in ice water. On a bad day it felt like her legs were clamped in a machine shop vice, screwed down to where the cranks stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bones splintered and cracked to accommodate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good.

My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the living room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up, and still went back to sleep.

Back then I thought there was nothing I could do.

The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as “not medically necessary.” Old treatments didn’t work, and still put us out for thousands of dollars.

UnitedHealthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year.

Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialists required for an appointment.

Prior authorizations took weeks, then months.

UnitedHealthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother’s doctor needed to fax his notes. Then UnitedHealthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondence, and required a hardcopy of the doctor’s typed notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they had received and filed the notes.

They promised coverage, and broke their word to my mother.

With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their hospital waiting room.

But it wasn’t them. It wasn’t the doctors, the receptionists, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians, or anyone we ever met. It was UnitedHealthcare.

People are dying. Evil has become institutionalized. Corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death, and anguished cries in the night of millions of Americans.

We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care commensurate with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then UnitedHealthcare changes the rules to suit their own profits. They think they make the rules, and think that because it’s legal that no one can punish them.

They think there’s no one out there who will stop them.

Now my own chronic back pain wakes me in the night, screaming in pain. I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us.

I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows. All extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions.

As our own chief executives, it’s our obligation to make our own lives better. First and foremost, we must seek to improve our own circumstances and defend ourselves. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others.

Rules exist between two individuals, in a network that covers the entire earth. Some of these rules are written down. Some of these rules emerge from natural respect between two individuals. Some of these rules are defined in physical laws, like the properties of gravity, magnetism or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate.

No single document better encapsulates the belief that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the frameworks for fostering collective well-being than the US constitution.

Writing a rule down makes it into a law. I don’t give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing. What does matter is following the guidance of our own logic and what we learn from those before us to maximize our own well-being, which will then maximize the well-being of our loved ones and community.

That’s where UnitedHealthcare went wrong. They violated their contract with my mother, with me, and tens of millions of other Americans. This threat to my own health, my family’s health, and the health of our country’s people requires me to respond with an act of war.

I want to share some of the feedback that I'm constantly having to give writers of all levels as an editor. My hope is this will resonate as helpful advice...

**Have confidence in your writing.** Stop waiting for external validation in a world full of people ready to tear your work apart. Inner confidence is what separates the “haves” from the “would-haves.”  
You have to believe in yourself. You have to believe that what you have to say—and how you say it—has value without needing someone to tell you you’re the next big thing. You might not be, and that’s okay. If you’re writing because you love it, stop waiting to be validated. Write with authenticity.

If you are writing to make money, I have but these words for you: *if Colleen Hoover can do it...*  
’Nough said.

If you *do* have something important to say, with goals of getting published, here are my two cents:

**Write as if your reader likes you, understands you, and wants to read your work.** I see so many writers—especially newer ones—writing like they have to cram everything likable about their work into the first paragraph. This behavior stems from a lack of confidence. Part of being a good writer is letting your reader do their job. Your job is to *author*: to tell your story authentically, honestly, and with vulnerability. Let the reader decide if they like what you have to say or how you say it. Stop trying to avoid vulnerability. Avoiding that vulnerability is the fastest way to lose emotional connection with your reader, no matter how exciting your fiction is. Honesty, vulnerability, and authenticity are the elements that resonate with a reader and turn a reader into a fan. We desire connection just as much as you do. We can't connect with you if you don't show us who you really are, or if you're unwilling to be real with us. We also cannot connect with you if you force it. *Buy us dinner first. Court us. Let us get to know you before we decide if you're 'the one.'*

**Connection is born from vulnerability.** Allow yourself the freedom to express. Let the reader see you in your characters, your scenes, and your dialogue. Don’t force them into a manufactured reality where your presence as the writer is the proverbial elephant in the room. We are already listening, stop asking us to listen, and tell us what is on your mind, heart, and soul. We don't need a perfect person to look at in awe, we need someone who understands our hearts who we in turn can understand and empathize with. We need human to human connection, good, bad, and all in-between.

In alignment with this, **stop trying to show the reader every color you can paint with in the first two paragraphs of your story.** We, as readers, already assume you’re both competent and creative—it’s a given. Don’t overcompensate for your lack of confidence by shoving every fun or interesting idea down the reader’s throat before they’ve had time to enjoy the journey. Yes, we get it: your idea is awesome. But tell us the *story,* not just the sparkly idea. We want to take it all in, *slowly.* We want to marvel at Hogwarts for the first time, or take a stroll through the Shire with you, *we want to be there with your character.*  
We don't want this:  
*Super Dog can fly, dive, run, bark the bark of a thousand barks, and even poop on the lawn without blinking! He's amazing and wonderful and the all fulfilling prophecy of Dog Lore!*

Well, that’s great, Robert, but I was told we’d be going on an *adventure*. Can we get back to the story, please? There’s a point here—let’s get to it *together,* shall we? Take us with you. Don’t throw it at us.

**Write what’s good to you.** If it’s not good to you, it’s not going to come together. You are not going to throw paint at a wall, step back, and see *The Starry Night* staring into you. If it *is* good to you, it might still need improvement, but that’s okay—we all need an editor. Write the STORY that's GOOD to you and then find an EDITOR. Stop worrying about your Grammar. You're writing a FIRST DRAFT, and you will inevitably need to clean it up. Sometimes there's a Second, Third, Fourth,...Twenty-Seventh Draft(s). That is fine. Just write the good story. If it's not good to you, the rule of thumb is *it's not good - yet (extra emphasis on the 'yet')*.

**Don’t let the loudest voices in the room be the only ones you hear.** The loudest voice authors usually hear is ~~usually~~ (see, we all need editing\*) their own inner critic. Stop. Shut up. And *write.* You’re your own harshest critic, but here’s the thing: we don’t care if you missed an exclamation mark or used “their” instead of “they’re” in a 4 a.m. coffee-deprived draft. And neither does your editor. I said *editor,* not Sally Shames-A-Lot, who reads your chapter and pretends you’re a second-grader who can’t spell “the.” Leave the editing to the professionals and stop holding yourself back just because your first draft looks like… a first draft. It’s *supposed* to. Breathe. You’ll get there. Write the story. Make it something YOU want to read.

A note: There are way too many armchair editors and self-proclaimed “grammar Nazis” out there, ready to rain on your parade. Guess what? They’re not writing your story. Stop listening to your inner perfectionist who survived your childhood trauma only to saddle you with Imposter Syndrome. WRITE YOUR STORY. Edit later. Grammar Nazis be damned! The story is the soul, we can make it pretty later. There is a time and place for grammatically correct drafts and it's the last one before publishing. Not the first draft to get the story breathing.

**Find Editors. Find Alpha Readers with guts. Find the persons who will be honest with you - for better and for worse - and LISTEN to them. Stop fantasizing that you’ll sit down at a computer and—bing! bang! zoom!—become Rowling.**“You’re a poet and don’t even know it” is a terrible joke, not a prophecy. You’re not in a Disney movie. The prince kissed someone else. And for those of you well beyond age 13—your Hogwarts letter isn’t coming. Stop thinking you’ll sit down and effortlessly churn out your masterpiece. Even Rowling got rejected at least a dozen times before becoming the highest-paid author of all time. Effort is what leads to success. Effort, effort, and more effort—not some magical, snowflake-like talent. Pay your dues. It’s okay to like your own writing. It’s okay to be good at writing and naturally talented. But it’s *not* okay to think a lack of effort is anything more than mediocrity. Reality, folks—revel in it.  
That said, **your first draft is going to suck.** You've started a novel! Enjoy your ticket to the sh\*tshow, I hope you brought popcorn! That reader/editor that made you cry your own tears or bleed your own blood - yeah, that @$$ hole is your BEST FRIEND. Listen when it's constructive. Learn the difference between a nothing-burger comment on ""their"" ""they're"" and ""there"" (which can be fixed with any decent free word processor, by the way) and a comment that may have value like ""I think your character Bobert from Cheeseville needs more depth, I don't understand why he wasn't wearing pants and I feel that may be relevant information."" Or ""I think this is a good start, but it's a little boring."" Those are the comments that you need to reflect on if you want to be a good writer. Re-word it. Re-work it and see what fits. You could be the next Rowling, not every sentence you type will be spun gold and you better know that. You have to have thick skin to do this. You have to believe in yourself enough to be critiqued and humble enough to know when something just does not work. Even the best writers have trash bins full of words that didn't work. Accept it. Your Alpha readers are not here to kiss your butt and if that's what you're after you're in the wrong line of work, stop wasting your time.  
Again, Grammar Nazis be damned! That is the FINAL step before publishing. Your focus is the STORY. The story is your setting, the characters, the plot. It is not wether you aced that second grade spelling test or can find 78 synonyms for ""glanced."" Write your story. Have confidence that will carry you through your own criticism, and then take a deep breath, and let yourself still be ""a real writer"" with real criticism from someone with intelligent feedback.

**You decide if you're ""a real writer."" Not your alpha/beta readers. Not your editors. Not the publishing companies. Let me tell you this: NO GUTS, NO GLORY.**

Have the guts. Have the guts to know your worth, know your skillset, and have the guts to tell the haters to kick rocks and have the guts to hear the ones with intelligent things to say. Have the guts to write with authenticity. Have the guts to write without the need to be published. Have the guts to be a good writer over a published one. Have the guts to write the story in your head that needs to be told.

The best advice I’ve ever gotten, I’ll pass on to you:

**WRITE. THE. THING.**

Then, when you get feedback (hopefully professional), **WRITE. IT. AGAIN.**

Many of you *are* creative and have something fantastic to share with the world. Stop letting your lack of confidence hold you back. Stop letting your incessant inner voice tell you that without validation it's pointless. Be a good writer. Be a better writer. You have a unique voice. Stop trying to force the world to see that and validate you before *you* see it. When you see your worth and write from that place, you’ll become that much better. Better is what publishers need. Do the work. Write.

1hbaolj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbaolj,22F and I feel like I’m going nuts: ADVICE NEEDED!!!,"Hello!

Cross posting this in /SleepApnea, & /UARS. Thoughts/opinions wanted and needed!!!

I just got my results back from an at home sleep study and I feel super lost. My sleep study diagnosis is “Other Sleep Disorder (flow limitation) and Snoring; no evidence of significant sleep-disordered breathing” and I have no clue how to move forward from here. I thought that I might have sleep apnea or UARS or something like that because of my symptoms and physical profile (which I’ve outlined below), but the study showed 0 AHI and ODI, and only 5.5 RDI. It did show that I woke up 10 times (I didn’t get up to pee or anything like that and I sleep with earplugs and an eye mask so I know it’s not an external distraction waking me), so I’m not really sure if that means anything or not. Anyways, after the sleep study I’m left feeling more frustrated than ever because I don’t really have any pathway to getting help but I still have all these symptoms. I know that at home sleep studies aren’t always the most accurate and that clinical ones are, but I’m a 22y/o newlywed with CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield that’s kinda weird about coverage sometimes (or maybe I just haven’t gotten the hang of understanding health insurance yet?) so I’m trying to figure out what options I have before doing an in-person study. Can anyone conclude what might be causing my issues from the previous/following? I know sleep disorders like sleep apnea are caricatured as an issue for older, overweight men, so it’s been hard for me to find support towards a cause for my issues. Is “Other Sleep Disorder (flow limitation)” a diagnosis? Can I get treatment like a CPAP or MAD (oral device) because of it? Please let me know your thoughts! Provider hasn’t commented anything but I am trying to figure out what my options are ahead of time as I am very plagued by my sleeping issues lately! Even if you feel like it’s a shot in the dark your opinion and thoughts are greatly appreciated!!

Physical profile:
- 22 y/o female
- BMI 19.6 (132lbs, 5’ 9”)
- No severe health conditions (suspected POTS and EDS though but I haven’t been diagnosed)
- No medications being taken
- Both parents have OSA and rely on CPAP machines every night

My symptoms/quirks:
- Severe teeth grinding: dentist said my teeth would be nubs by now if I didn’t wear my hard night guard, I ground deep grooves into my guard that have to be drilled away each appointment, I often wake up with jaw pain or headaches I suspect due to my grinding, people I’ve shared a room with say they can hear me grinding at night, etc. Stress can cause grinding this bad but I don’t think I’m stressed out that terribly and my dentist thinks that I’m grinding my teeth so aggressively in an effort to open up/move around my airway.
- I feel exhausted ALL THE TIME: I feel like the laziest piece of crap ever but truly I’m so exhausted all the time no matter what I do. I don’t drink coffee or any other type of caffeine regularly (like soda) because I have anxiety and it makes me all jittery and shaky so I just try to will through it but it feels like I need to take a nap every single day and I CAN’T (work).
- Crazy brain fog: like I genuinely feel like I’m getting dumber as time goes on, and maybe I am but it just doesn’t feel like I’m mentally operating the way I used to it just feels like my brain’s capacity to function has been significantly diminished and I’m not sure if it’s just age or what but I feel like I’m going crazy.
- Snoring: I thought I didn’t snore but my husband has reported hearing me snoring, especially recently.
- Never sleeping on back: this is kind of a random one but it’s a puzzle piece I put together a few years ago… basically I’ve never been able to sleep on my back as long as I can remember and if I wake up in the middle of the night it’s usually because I’ve flipped onto my back. I always sleep on my side or stomach, I literally can’t sleep on my back.
- Large tongue??: every time I go to my dentist she talks about what a large tongue I have and at first I thought it was some kind of joke or something but I realized that if I lay on my back and relax my tongue literally falls into the back of my throat and completely chokes me like I can’t get any air through at all.
- Shaking my head “no” when I flip on my back??: another weird one but my husband said he looked over while I was sleeping and he saw me sleeping on my back (he thought I was awake) shaking my head back and forth like you would shake your head “no”. Not even sure if this has anything to do with anything. Maybe I had a bad dream that I didn’t remember but part of me thought it could be me trying to move my head in an effort to breathe better?
- Decreased productivity: I feel like a lazy slug who has energy to do anything all day even though I have so many goals, aspirations and things I need to get done.
- Shinners/tired eyes: my dentist keeps commenting about how I have shinners (like a bluish around your undereyes like you have a black eye) and thinks they are caused by poor sleep and poor oxygenation and said that she can tell that I’m tired and that she sees it in my eyes and literally took their digital camera (that they take pictures of your teeth with) and had the nurse take a picture of my eyes LOL.
- Possible acid reflux?: I didn’t really know what acid reflux was but my dentist basically asked if it ever tastes like puke when I lay down or wake up and I was like yea occasionally I wake up and my mouth has that stomach acid taste like I threw up but I know that I didn’t.
- Waking up with dry mouth/drooling on pillow: self explanatory.
- Moody: generally, and especially so lately, I just feel like I can swing into having little outbursts of being grumpy or sad lately and I have no clue what my deal is. Not like screaming at everyone outbursts, but like a solid 10 minutes of just UGH where I’ll usually just cry out of frustration. IDEK what’s wrong with me, I feel nuts.
- Can get 12 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted: no matter how much sleep I get I always feel like I can get more, it’s been like this for as long as I can remember.
- Consciously waking up: waking up like 3-5 times a night and remembering it. According to my at-home sleep study I woke up 9 times that night. I feel like that’s not really normal but maybe it is idk anymore.
- Worsened anxiety: I’ve always kinda had anxiety, but lately and with all my symptoms worsening I just feel like it’s getting worse and IDK what my deal is.

What I think might fix it?:
Because of my parent’s success and everything I’ve found about CPAP being the gold standard of treatment for sleep breathing issues, I want to go for a CPAP. I know that it’s probably seen as lame to have one at my age but I don’t care anymore, I just want to feel like I’m living again. But with my at-home sleep study results, I don’t even know if I can qualify for a CPAP or if it’ll even help anything. My second option was a MAD (oral device), to move my jaw forward to help my airway because I’ve been fine wearing my night guard every night, but because this isn’t as effective as CPAP, CPAP’s been what I think will help fix my problem the best.

Pictures of my sleep study results/night guard (LOL) are attached. Please comment your thoughts or advice, I am desperately seeking it! Sorry for the absolute rambling, I’m both physically and mentally tired and I have no clue if there's any end in sight and it’s really taking a toll on me. If any of this comes off as entitled or rude or stupid or whiney I’m very sorry, that is not my intention at all I’m just very struggling and very frustrated and I’m not sure what to do so I’m hoping someone on here can point me in the right direction because it genuinely does feel like I’m slowly dying. Regardless, if you're reading this, I hope that you know that you are LOVED! And that you and your family have a very happy holiday season :)!!!

TL/DR: 22F having weird issues surrounding my sleep; at-home sleep study didn’t show anything significant so now I have no clue what to do. Advice needed/wanted!!!

1hbaoht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hbaoht/should_i_still_leave_my_recently_abusive_but/,Should I still leave my recently abusive but pregnant gf?,"Hi y’all,

If you read my other posts you’ll get more of a back story. But to start with this. My gf has been terribly abusive. Hitting me beyond belief for sometimes the most ridiculous of reason. Really just every time she got angry. It was terrible. I could never leave. If I tried she’d chase my truck down or threaten to get rid of my dogs and she’d throw them outside so I had to come back. Then I was trapped. 

I would create these plans to be able to get my stuff and the pups and leave and then she would be good and innocent and cute for a couple days and we would be excited and talking about baby and I would end up staying. And then another episode would always come.

Well recently I went through about three straight days of episodes. Her hitting me over and over, hitting the baby bump, making me leave the house, making me take my stuff out of the house, her throwing my stuff out of the car window as we were driving then dumping hot coffee all over me. (There was hitting and physical abuse all three days btw) I had enough. 

I left. With everything I already had in my truck. Got my own apartment. And was prepared to use the police to get the rest of my stuff. I didn’t want to. But if that was the only way then I would. Anyways she wanted to talk about things and told me she’s gonna change. I’ve told her to get help multiple times now she’s actually saying she’s gonna do it. She begs me not to leave her and all this. And for some reason I keep caring and I don’t want to see her hurt or alone. 

I think this time she is serious. But I’m not totally sure. And even if she is. I don’t really know if I even want to stay after all she has done. She’s broken so many things of mine. Hit me so many times. But in the end she’s still carrying my child. I don’t think I want to stay, but I’m struggling to force myself to leave. What should I do?",2,1733860702.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I started with a Sage Barista machine, that I still have, but I was considering on getting a grinder since I am using the built in grinder, and I heard a lot that the grind is very important. That's why my decision for a upgrade is, going for a better grinder.

I still don't know if I am ready on spending much more than 550€ on a grinder or any machine for the coffee world, since I am still a noob and don't think I would get so deep into it. What I know is, that I mostly make espresso or milk coffee and no filter coffee.

Anyway my question is, should I go for the MiiCoffee DF54 or for the Niche Zero, the Niche costs twice as much as the DF54, but is it worth it? Or would you even recommend the DF64 instead of the Niche or DF54?

I saved money by going to the college bookstores and taking photos of the pages I needed (or all of the pages, if necessary) and using free PDF apps that easily allow you to square & increase the contrast on photos and export them to PDF & other formats. If I needed something printed there were a few labs with free printing. I recommend this to everyone. The students manning the counters never gave a shit and I probably saved minimum over $1000 over 3.5 years.

Occasionally, if they didn't have the book I needed in stock, I'd borrow a friends for an evening, photo the whole thing I needed, and then give it back (sometimes buy a coffee as a thanks).

Came in super handy, especially with the severely overpriced textbooks self-published by professors at the university that weren't available anywhere else.",24,1733860440.0,Frugal,12,0.83,False

Cross posting this in /SleepApnea, & /UARS. Not asking for diagnosis/medical advice, just asking for your thoughts and opinions!

I just got my results back from an at home sleep study and I feel super lost. My sleep study diagnosis is “Other Sleep Disorder (flow limitation) and Snoring; no evidence of significant sleep-disordered breathing” and I have no clue how to move forward from here. I thought that I might have sleep apnea or UARS or something like that because of my symptoms and physical profile (which I’ve outlined below), but the study showed 0 AHI and ODI, and only 5.5 RDI. It did show that I woke up 10 times (I didn’t get up to pee or anything like that and I sleep with earplugs and an eye mask so I know it’s not an external distraction waking me), so I’m not really sure if that means anything or not. Anyways, after the sleep study I’m left feeling more frustrated than ever because I don’t really have any pathway to getting help but I still have all these symptoms. I know that at home sleep studies aren’t always the most accurate and that clinical ones are, but I’m a 22y/o newlywed with CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield that’s kinda weird about coverage sometimes (or maybe I just haven’t gotten the hang of understanding health insurance yet?) so I’m trying to figure out what options I have before doing an in-person study. Can anyone conclude what might be causing my issues from the previous/following? I know sleep disorders like sleep apnea are caricatured as an issue for older, overweight men, so it’s been hard for me to find support towards a cause for my issues. Is “Other Sleep Disorder (flow limitation)” a diagnosis? Can I get treatment like a CPAP or MAD (oral device) because of it? Please let me know your thoughts! Provider hasn’t commented anything but I am trying to figure out what my options are ahead of time as I am very plagued by my sleeping issues lately! Even if you feel like it’s a shot in the dark your opinion and thoughts are greatly appreciated!!

Physical profile:
- 22 y/o female
- BMI 19.6 (132lbs, 5’ 9”)
- No severe health conditions (suspected POTS and EDS though but I haven’t been diagnosed)
- No medications being taken
- Both parents have OSA and rely on CPAP machines every night

My symptoms/quirks:
- Severe teeth grinding: dentist said my teeth would be nubs by now if I didn’t wear my hard night guard, I ground deep grooves into my guard that have to be drilled away each appointment, I often wake up with jaw pain or headaches I suspect due to my grinding, people I’ve shared a room with say they can hear me grinding at night, etc. Stress can cause grinding this bad but I don’t think I’m stressed out that terribly and my dentist thinks that I’m grinding my teeth so aggressively in an effort to open up/move around my airway.
- I feel exhausted ALL THE TIME: I feel like the laziest piece of crap ever but truly I’m so exhausted all the time no matter what I do. I don’t drink coffee or any other type of caffeine regularly (like soda) because I have anxiety and it makes me all jittery and shaky so I just try to will through it but it feels like I need to take a nap every single day and I CAN’T (work).
- Crazy brain fog: like I genuinely feel like I’m getting dumber as time goes on, and maybe I am but it just doesn’t feel like I’m mentally operating the way I used to it just feels like my brain’s capacity to function has been significantly diminished and I’m not sure if it’s just age or what but I feel like I’m going crazy.
- Snoring: I thought I didn’t snore but my husband has reported hearing me snoring, especially recently.
- Never sleeping on back: this is kind of a random one but it’s a puzzle piece I put together a few years ago… basically I’ve never been able to sleep on my back as long as I can remember and if I wake up in the middle of the night it’s usually because I’ve flipped onto my back. I always sleep on my side or stomach, I literally can’t sleep on my back.
- Large tongue??: every time I go to my dentist she talks about what a large tongue I have and at first I thought it was some kind of joke or something but I realized that if I lay on my back and relax my tongue literally falls into the back of my throat and completely chokes me like I can’t get any air through at all.
- Shaking my head “no” when I flip on my back??: another weird one but my husband said he looked over while I was sleeping and he saw me sleeping on my back (he thought I was awake) shaking my head back and forth like you would shake your head “no”. Not even sure if this has anything to do with anything. Maybe I had a bad dream that I didn’t remember but part of me thought it could be me trying to move my head in an effort to breathe better?
- Decreased productivity: I feel like a lazy slug who has energy to do anything all day even though I have so many goals, aspirations and things I need to get done.
- Shinners/tired eyes: my dentist keeps commenting about how I have shinners (like a bluish around your undereyes like you have a black eye) and thinks they are caused by poor sleep and poor oxygenation and said that she can tell that I’m tired and that she sees it in my eyes and literally took their digital camera (that they take pictures of your teeth with) and had the nurse take a picture of my eyes LOL.
- Possible acid reflux?: I didn’t really know what acid reflux was but my dentist basically asked if it ever tastes like puke when I lay down or wake up and I was like yea occasionally I wake up and my mouth has that stomach acid taste like I threw up but I know that I didn’t.
- Waking up with dry mouth/drooling on pillow: self explanatory.
- Moody: generally, and especially so lately, I just feel like I can swing into having little outbursts of being grumpy or sad lately and I have no clue what my deal is. Not like screaming at everyone outbursts, but like a solid 10 minutes of just UGH where I’ll usually just cry out of frustration. IDEK what’s wrong with me, I feel nuts.
- Can get 12 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted: no matter how much sleep I get I always feel like I can get more, it’s been like this for as long as I can remember.
- Consciously waking up: waking up like 3-5 times a night and remembering it. According to my at-home sleep study I woke up 9 times that night. I feel like that’s not really normal but maybe it is idk anymore.
- Worsened anxiety: I’ve always kinda had anxiety, but lately and with all my symptoms worsening I just feel like it’s getting worse and IDK what my deal is.

What I think might fix it?:
Because of my parent’s success and everything I’ve found about CPAP being the gold standard of treatment for sleep breathing issues, I want to go for a CPAP. I know that it’s probably seen as lame to have one at my age but I don’t care anymore, I just want to feel like I’m living again. But with my at-home sleep study results, I don’t even know if I can qualify for a CPAP or if it’ll even help anything. My second option was a MAD (oral device), to move my jaw forward to help my airway because I’ve been fine wearing my night guard every night, but because this isn’t as effective as CPAP, CPAP’s been what I think will help fix my problem the best.

Please comment your thoughts or advice, I am desperately seeking it! Sorry for the absolute rambling, I’m both physically and mentally tired and I have no clue if there's any end in sight and it’s really taking a toll on me.

1hbajt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1hbajt8/west_coast_in_december/,West coast in December ,"Hi all, 
I’m visiting in laws for 2.5 weeks this December over Christmas and new years. I am coming from the USA and in recent years I find myself dependant on my partner to drive as renting automatic is expensive and I’ve never driven on the left side of the road. 

We stay at his parents house in small town 45 min outside Sligo (Gurteen) I know there’s a bus that goes into town now and so I have some freedom there. We typically are house bound unless doing Christmas shopping or my partner has boys nights catching up with his friends. Otherwise we are home to visit the family so there’s not much exploring being done.

1. Should I shell out the money and get a rental car? ($800 for 16 days) I fear there’s not much to do in winter due to little day light, weather after storm Darragh, and it being around Christmas. The car will just sit on the lot at the house most of the time as I would be too scared to drive BUT I’d have the freedom to go somewhere if it was there. 

2. What is there to do tourism wise the two weeks at Christmas that’s not hiking? I love sightseeing, coffee shops, clothes shopping, craft classes, historical sights. I’d need a car to go anywhere of course but if there’s not much to do, I won’t bother with the car and just ride the train from Dublin to west coast. I’d be house bound again for nearly 3 weeks unless I ask someone for a ride somewhere. My partner does have a car he’s bought there that waits for us to use every visit but it’s me having to ask him if we can go somewhere, means less time he has at home with his parents so I’m trying to be mindful.

After an almost sleepless night reading everything I could find in the sub about freezing coffee, I kinda formed an opinion but I still have some questions

- in case I freeze the whole bag, when I took the bag out should I remove the tape from the valve right away or after the coffee has defrosted? 
- my freezer is pretty tiny, so to save space centrifuge tubes are out of the question. I read about using good ziplock bags, but how do I tell a good one from a bad one? Any link or suggestion? 
- for the people who tried freezing both the full bags and the single doses: how big of a difference does it make? Would it make sense to split into doses for the very special stuff but not bothering for the more regular stuff? 
- grinding frozen beans straight from the freezer: does it make a difference? Any precautions? Do I still need to wet the beans to prevent static? 

Thanks in advance for your help, and keep up the good brews ",2,1733860334.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

For example ""go to the cinema/coffee shop alone - 4/10"" or ""join a class/group - 7/10"".

1hbaens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1hbaens/alchemical_sciences_investigator_and_the_action/,Alchemical Sciences Investigator and the Action Economy,"I'm currently playing a Gnoll (Kholo) Investigator based around the Alchemical Sciences methodology. My idea was to have a grizzled guy who chugs dangerous concoctions in order to get by. After playing with the character for three levels (12 now) I'm starting to give up on that idea in exchange for a more standard sword and board type character. I'll discuss that more in a moment, but first an overview of the build.

The build is mostly a bunch of out-of-combat abilities, but of note I've taken Alchemical Discoveries, Shared Stratagem, Ongoing Strategy and the Sword Cane item. Mechanically the idea was to have a combo-oriented big hitter: Devise a Stratagem (DaS) > good roll > Off-hand attack secondary enemy > Main-hand attack DaS enemy   
Alternately: DaS > bad roll > brew and chug a potion

But honestly in combat I always end up feeling a bit out of place, not having enough actions, having nothing to do with my last action, and sometimes just not doing enough during combat. Part of the problem is Interacting to put away the Cane Sheath to brew potions. Now at level 12 the options are all pretty strong. Just as Planned seems the obvious choice given the build, but I was tempted to take to take Share Tincture to help buff my allies. Problem with Share Tincture is how it takes three bloody actions to just give the potion to someone else, which seems unintentional to me? Like why not just use two actions to feed the potion to my ally with my own turn, instead of wasting one, or even two of theirs. Harrumph.

As for the other two level 12 choices, I've got Foresee Danger on the sheet right now, mostly to avoid this whole headache, plus I fell into lava two sessions ago and lost my armor and all the runes (long story). So cheating out extra defense would be nice, potentially +6 if the stars align. And my friend has really tempted me towards Reason Rapidly, given how many Recall Knowledge buffs I have (and the pure meme value of it.)

So I'm feeling a little stuck, I don't know where I want to take the character. Is the build even good? Or am I trying to do too much at once. I don't want to abandon the flavour of the character, but Share TIncture just sucks in its current implementation. Just as Planned, again, is the obvious choice, but it doesn't solve my action economy problem. And the whole Sword Cane thing is a awkward, especially since Ongoing Strategy disincentivises my from attacking myself or allies when facing a single enemy. The whole potion thing also seems like a miss, except for Insight Coffee and Elixirs of Life.

Maybe the correct choice to accept being bad in combat and just take Reason Rapidly for the shits and giggles. At least I can use my last action on something useful.

tl;dr My build sucks, what do?",2,1733859996.0,Pathfinder2e,1,1.0,False

i’ve used liposomal vitamin C for a bit if success, however even that it doing the trick all to well.  Has anyone had any success with helping the liver detox?

Cross posting this in /SleepApnea, & /UARS.

I just got my results back from an at home sleep study and I feel super lost. My sleep study diagnosis is “Other Sleep Disorder (flow limitation) and Snoring; no evidence of significant sleep-disordered breathing” and I have no clue how to move forward from here. I thought that I might have sleep apnea or UARS or something like that because of my symptoms and physical profile (which I’ve outlined below), but the study showed 0 AHI and ODI, and only 5.5 RDI. It did show that I woke up 10 times (I didn’t get up to pee or anything like that and I sleep with earplugs and an eye mask so I know it’s not an external distraction waking me), so I’m not really sure if that means anything or not. Anyways, after the sleep study I’m left feeling more frustrated than ever because I don’t really have any pathway to getting help but I still have all these symptoms. I know that at home sleep studies aren’t always the most accurate and that clinical ones are, but I’m a 22y/o newlywed with CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield that’s kinda weird about coverage sometimes (or maybe I just haven’t gotten the hang of understanding health insurance yet?) so I’m trying to figure out what options I have before doing an in-person study. Can anyone conclude what might be causing my issues from the previous/following? I know sleep disorders like sleep apnea are caricatured as an issue for older, overweight men, so it’s been hard for me to find support towards a cause for my issues. Is “Other Sleep Disorder (flow limitation)” a diagnosis? Can I get treatment like a CPAP or MAD (oral device) because of it? Please let me know your thoughts! Provider hasn’t commented anything but I am trying to figure out what my options are ahead of time as I am very plagued by my sleeping issues lately! Even if you feel like it’s a shot in the dark your opinion and thoughts are greatly appreciated!!

Physical profile:
- 22 y/o female
- BMI 19.6 (132lbs, 5’ 9”)
- No severe health conditions (suspected POTS and EDS though but I haven’t been diagnosed)
- No medications being taken
- Both parents have OSA and rely on CPAP machines every night

My symptoms/quirks:
- Severe teeth grinding: dentist said my teeth would be nubs by now if I didn’t wear my hard night guard, I ground deep grooves into my guard that have to be drilled away each appointment, I often wake up with jaw pain or headaches I suspect due to my grinding, people I’ve shared a room with say they can hear me grinding at night, etc. Stress can cause grinding this bad but I don’t think I’m stressed out that terribly and my dentist thinks that I’m grinding my teeth so aggressively in an effort to open up/move around my airway.
- I feel exhausted ALL THE TIME: I feel like the laziest piece of crap ever but truly I’m so exhausted all the time no matter what I do. I don’t drink coffee or any other type of caffeine regularly (like soda) because I have anxiety and it makes me all jittery and shaky so I just try to will through it but it feels like I need to take a nap every single day and I CAN’T (work).
- Crazy brain fog: like I genuinely feel like I’m getting dumber as time goes on, and maybe I am but it just doesn’t feel like I’m mentally operating the way I used to it just feels like my brain’s capacity to function has been significantly diminished and I’m not sure if it’s just age or what but I feel like I’m going crazy.
- Snoring: I thought I didn’t snore but my husband has reported hearing me snoring, especially recently.
- Never sleeping on back: this is kind of a random one but it’s a puzzle piece I put together a few years ago… basically I’ve never been able to sleep on my back as long as I can remember and if I wake up in the middle of the night it’s usually because I’ve flipped onto my back. I always sleep on my side or stomach, I literally can’t sleep on my back.
- Large tongue??: every time I go to my dentist she talks about what a large tongue I have and at first I thought it was some kind of joke or something but I realized that if I lay on my back and relax my tongue literally falls into the back of my throat and completely chokes me like I can’t get any air through at all.
- Shaking my head “no” when I flip on my back??: another weird one but my husband said he looked over while I was sleeping and he saw me sleeping on my back (he thought I was awake) shaking my head back and forth like you would shake your head “no”. Not even sure if this has anything to do with anything. Maybe I had a bad dream that I didn’t remember but part of me thought it could be me trying to move my head in an effort to breathe better?
- Decreased productivity: I feel like a lazy slug who has energy to do anything all day even though I have so many goals, aspirations and things I need to get done.
- Shinners/tired eyes: my dentist keeps commenting about how I have shinners (like a bluish around your undereyes like you have a black eye) and thinks they are caused by poor sleep and poor oxygenation and said that she can tell that I’m tired and that she sees it in my eyes and literally took their digital camera (that they take pictures of your teeth with) and had the nurse take a picture of my eyes LOL.
- Possible acid reflux?: I didn’t really know what acid reflux was but my dentist basically asked if it ever tastes like puke when I lay down or wake up and I was like yea occasionally I wake up and my mouth has that stomach acid taste like I threw up but I know that I didn’t.
- Waking up with dry mouth/drooling on pillow: self explanatory.
- Moody: generally, and especially so lately, I just feel like I can swing into having little outbursts of being grumpy or sad lately and I have no clue what my deal is. Not like screaming at everyone outbursts, but like a solid 10 minutes of just UGH where I’ll usually just cry out of frustration. IDEK what’s wrong with me, I feel nuts.
- Can get 12 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted: no matter how much sleep I get I always feel like I can get more, it’s been like this for as long as I can remember.
- Consciously waking up: waking up like 3-5 times a night and remembering it. According to my at-home sleep study I woke up 9 times that night. I feel like that’s not really normal but maybe it is idk anymore.
- Worsened anxiety: I’ve always kinda had anxiety, but lately and with all my symptoms worsening I just feel like it’s getting worse and IDK what my deal is.

What I think might fix it?:
Because of my parent’s success and everything I’ve found about CPAP being the gold standard of treatment for sleep breathing issues, I want to go for a CPAP. I know that it’s probably seen as lame to have one at my age but I don’t care anymore, I just want to feel like I’m living again. But with my at-home sleep study results, I don’t even know if I can qualify for a CPAP or if it’ll even help anything. My second option was a MAD (oral device), to move my jaw forward to help my airway because I’ve been fine wearing my night guard every night, but because this isn’t as effective as CPAP, CPAP’s been what I think will help fix my problem the best.

Pictures of my sleep study results/night guard (LOL) are attached. Please comment your thoughts or advice, I am desperately seeking it! Sorry for the absolute rambling, I’m both physically and mentally tired and I have no clue if there's any end in sight and it’s really taking a toll on me. If any of this comes off as entitled or rude or stupid or whiney I’m very sorry, that is not my intention at all I’m just very struggling and very frustrated and I’m not sure what to do so I’m hoping someone on here can point me in the right direction because it genuinely does feel like I’m slowly dying.

I am getting rid of it ASAP after reading my Great-Great Grandmother's journal,"I didn’t expect to inherit anything. My grandmother was in her late eighties, sharp as ever but a recluse, living alone in her modest Pennsylvania home. When the call came that she had passed, I braced myself for the usual, funerals, family meetings, and the empty routines that follow a death. But the lawyer’s voice on the other end of the line carried words I didn’t quite believe at first: *she left everything to you.* *You inherit everything.* And so, I found myself sitting at my desk a week later, staring at the paper in my hand, which detailed a small bank account, a list of her possessions, and an old home home that had belonged to her great-grandmother, passed down the generations to her. I didn’t know the house existed before then.

The home was located near a small, fog-covered town in Essex County, Massachusetts. The house was old, Victorian, from the 1800s. They said many English families had made their way to this part of Massachusetts back in the day. Now, the house was mine, an empty thing, left seemingly untouched since the days my great-grandmother had come from England to start life fresh.

I couldn’t help but think of it as an opportunity: an old, historic home, full of history, full of stories, full of *value*. I packed my things, closed the door to my small Philadelphia apartment, and made my way to the old house with dreams of making it profitable, restoring its charm, selling it at a premium, and starting over with a huge stack of cash.

The house came into view as I pulled down a narrow road at the end of a steep hill. It was huge, and unmistakably old, with two stories of pale wood, steep gabled roofs, and high windows.

I had looked for the best-reviewed realtor in the area ahead of time and had him meet me there. I parked in the gravel driveway and climbed out of my car. The realtor was waiting on the porch, his hand already outstretched waiting to greet me. He had the look of a professional, sharp and well put-together.

“Hello, welcome” he said as I approached. His voice was smooth and steady, and he looked at me with an easy smile. “I’m Samuel Drake. It’s good to meet you. I’ll be helping you through the sale of this property, making it as pain-free as possible for you.”

I shook his hand and looked at the house again. It looked… lived-in, almost, despite being vacant for so long. “Yes. Thank you for meeting me here,” I said, trying to keep my tone neutral.

Drake glanced back toward the house as though he’d already been thinking about this. “This house has a lot of value. Properties like this one, historic homes in this part of Massachusetts, they’re rare. With a bit of cleaning and repair, this could easily sell for close to a million. There’s interest here, especially with the old Victorian charm and the history behind it. It’s a prime candidate for restoration.”

I stared back at him, caught off-guard. Almost a million dollars. The number hung in the air for a moment. I wasn’t sure how I’d expected this trip to go, but I hadn’t expected to hear that.

“Really? That much?” I managed to say, surprised at how calm I sounded.

Drake nodded, stepping toward the house. “Oh, yes. There’s demand for homes like this. And with the right work, it could be an easy sale. Nothing that can’t be managed with a little attention to detail.”

Before I could respond, another figure came from the side of the house, tall, broad-shouldered, his hair a bright white that contrasted against his flannel shirt. He looked at me as though he already knew who I was.

 “Hi there, I’m Jonathan Hale,” he said, offering his hand in greeting. His voice was deep, steady, and his handshake was firm.

“Hi Jonathan… sorry but… who are you?” I asked.

“I’m the caretaker, I’ve been caring for the place for years, 23 to be exact, maintaining the property. Your grandmother employed me for to look after this place and make sure it didn’t fall into disrepair. It’s good to meet you.”

I shook his hand, feeling the strength in his grip. He looked at the house briefly, as though sizing it up in the same way I was. “You’ve done a great job keeping this place up,” I said, looking around at the house and its well-maintained appearance.

Jonathan smiled faintly. “Ah, thank you, but I’m not a young man anymore, so some things have been harder to keep up with. Some things just need attention. But nothing that will be a big problem,” he said, and his voice was calm, practical.

Samuel clapped his hands together, breaking the brief silence. “Well, let’s not waste time. I’ll show you inside and we’ll get you started on what you need to know about the house. I can give you the grand tour, and go over all the details about market prep.”

I glanced back at the house again as Samuel led the way toward the door. The house wasn’t ominous or cold, it was elegant, if a bit dusty, and it had the air of an old property with stories and history but nothing that sent a shiver down my spine. I wasn’t thinking about ghosts, shadows, or hidden secrets. I wasn’t even thinking about the history of my family that had led me here.

I was thinking about that number again, close to a million. It sounded good. It sounded like freedom.

“Yeah, lead the way” I said, following Samuel into the house.

Jonathan gave a polite wave as he turned back toward his truck.

“Come on inside,” Samuel said as he turned toward the house again, motioning to the heavy wooden door. His voice broke the quiet.

I followed him up the steps and through the wide front door, its brass doorknob worn smooth. Stepping into the entryway, I could feel the cold from the outdoors ease slightly, replaced by the faint creak of the wooden floors beneath my shoes.

The first thing I noticed about the house was its age. But not in a way that felt oppressive or eerie, it felt lived-in, as though it was frozen in time. The walls were adorned with pale floral wallpaper that looked faded but elegant, the patterns intricate swirls of muted green and gold that must have been beautiful in their prime. The grand staircase curved up to the second floor, the dark mahogany polished but showing signs of age. Its wood felt solid under my hand as I touched the banister.

“This entryway is one of the most charming parts of the house,” Samuel said, looking at me as I took in my surroundings. His hands were clasped loosely in front of him, his voice even and friendly as he gestured around. “When this house was built, they really took their time with craftsmanship. Look at this woodwork, staircase, bannisters, the original molding around the doors. They don’t make them like this anymore.”

I nodded and took a few steps further into the space, my eyes tracing the patterns on the floor; oak hardwood. “I can see that,” I said.

The living room was directly to the right of the entryway, through a wide archway. Samuel led me inside, and I could feel the size of the space. It was large, with a high ceiling, ornate plasterwork on the edges, and a massive fireplace that took up almost the entire far wall. The mantle was carved wood, with ivy-like scrolls curling into the corners. The hearth was empty now, cold and gray, but I could imagine it roaring with a fire on a winter’s night.

“This is the original fireplace, here since day one. You’ll need to make sure it’s cleaned up, but it has good bones. Nothing that needs replacing unless you want to upgrade things.”

I took in the space. The wide bay windows let in just enough natural light to highlight the faint dust floating in the air. I could almost hear old voices from the past: laughter, footsteps, the faint clink of teacups.

Samuel seemed to catch me staring. “It’s got a lot of potential. The kind of charm buyers look for.”

He started moving toward the hallway leading deeper into the house, and I followed. As we walked through the corridor, the sound of our shoes on the floorboards felt almost intrusive, breaking the stillness of the air. The hallway was narrow, lined with doors on either side. Most of the rooms had wooden frames around their entryways, with faded floral patterns matching the wallpaper in the foyer.

“This house has six bedrooms,” Samuel said, pausing as he gestured to a door on the right. “And a formal dining room, a parlor, and a butler's pantry off the kitchen. The roof was redone about 30 years ago, so it’s solid and in good condition. Most of the upkeep has been maintenance here and there, like addressing cracks in the plaster, ensuring the old piping works well.”

We stepped into one of the rooms, which was bright even with the overcast sky outside. The walls were pale blue with white trim, and there was a single large window letting in light. The bed frame was gone, but the size of the space was impressive; high ceilings, wooden floors, and a small wardrobe sitting against one wall.

“It doesn’t look like much now, but this will be ideal for staging or showing,” Samuel added, looking around the space. “These rooms will shine with just a fresh coat of paint and a little attention. You can decide on how much you want to invest in repairs. Honestly, I think you’ll find that the charm of the house and its history will speak for themselves to buyers with minimal upgrades.”

I glanced back at him, taking the space in again. “What about the yard? The bushes out front and the overgrowth. It looks like it’s been a while since anyone worked on the landscaping.”

Samuel nodded in agreement. “Yes, we should focus on the outside, it won’t be anything you can’t handle with a little time. The older gentleman who helped with the property mostly focused on maintenance inside, so the garden and surrounding foliage have gotten a bit wild over the years. If you want, I can give you a few contacts for local landscapers. It might save time.”

I looked through the window at the backyard. The yard stretched back into a forest of trees, old pines and maples. It looked like an untouched wilderness, which would only add to the appeal for the right buyer but still felt like it would need attention.

“It’s fine, I’ll take care of it myself,” I said, knowing I couldn’t afford landscapers. It was clear this was going to be a lot of work, but nothing that seemed insurmountable. Not yet anyway. “Anything else I should know before diving into this?”

Samuel offered a thin smile and gestured toward the front windows as he leaned his hands on the wall. “Nothing major. The house is solid overall, but the age will always bring its quirks, old pipes, old wiring. But you’ll see all of that as you get started. The real key is cleaning up the place without losing the original character. That’s what buyers are looking for.”

I took a deep breath, looking back at the large living room and its worn yet graceful design.

“All right,” I said, taking another look at the hallway. “Well, let me get started.”

Samuel gave another easy, confident smile and led the way as he showed me the rest of the home.

After Samuel wrapped up the tour, his parting words were brief and professional. “If you need anything, just give me a call. I look forward to working with you.” He gave me a firm handshake by the door and departed, leaving me alone with the house.

I stood in the quiet entryway for a moment, staring at the door as it clicked shut behind him. The house felt much larger and quieter now that I was alone. I shook it off, grabbed my duffel bag from the couch, and made my way into the living room. I set up a fire in the large stone fireplace with a few logs I’d found in the yard.

I ordered some takeout from a local Chinese place and sat cross-legged on the living room floor with my carton of sesame chicken. After dinner, I laid out my sleeping bag near the fire. I wasn’t planning to waste money on hotels or anything while I was here, so it made sense to just sleep in the living room for now. It was warm, cozy enough.

The first night passed without incident. I slept deeply by the fire, the warmth keeping the cold air outside at bay. My mind was thinking about money, and the tasks I needed to complete as I drifted off, and I didn’t stir until the first light of morning shined through the windows.

I woke to the sound of birds in the trees and a thin streak of sunlight cutting through the curtains. I could feel the soreness in my throat from a night sleeping in dusty air next to a fire, but I forced myself up and stretched. Today would be the first real day of getting to know the property, of starting the hopefully short road to cleaning and preparing it for sale.

I grabbed my coat, a pair of gloves, and my work boots from the front hall, then made my way out the front door into the chill of the morning.

The first few hours of yard work felt productive, if not exhausting. Around noon, I decided I needed a break. My hands were raw, my arms sore, and the cold wind felt like it went right through my coat. I leaned my rake against an old oak tree in the front yard and stood for a moment, staring at the house.

I wiped my nose with my sleeve and decided that it would be good to poke around a little more inside. I had some time to kill, and the house had plenty more to see.

I wandered through the house slowly, this time on my own without Samuel as a guide. I let my curiosity lead me. The rooms felt different when you explored them without purpose. It was fun exploring the place, and I was hoping maybe I’d find a secret room or something interesting.

I started opening doors one by one, rooms filled with antiques, covered furniture, and other knick-knacks. Upstairs, toward the back of the house, I found another room, it wasn’t locked, but there was a resistance when I turned the handle, as though the door had been forgotten or avoided for a long time.

I hesitated for just a moment, then pushed it open.

The room was dim, the light barely reaching it through a small window. There were trunks, old ones, wooden and worn, and a writing desk by the window. I could see scraps of paper scattered on the desk, some of them half-buried beneath dust and age. The smell hit me first, a faint mustiness.

I walked over to the desk and began to examine the papers, brushing the dust off the top. What I found made my breath catch.

It was a journal. The leather cover was aged and worn, and the pages were filled with elegant handwriting in a style that was old, deliberate, and beautiful. It was difficult at first to read. It used words and phrasing I wasn’t used to, but as I read, I felt my excitement grow.

The journal clearly belonged to my great-great-grandmother. Excited, I took the journal back downstairs with me, setting it on my sleeping bag with plans to read it in the evening once I was done with my yard work.

I finished up my work outside, feeling sore but accomplished. I ordered dinner from a local pizza place, eager to sit by the fire, warm and quiet, and read the journal I had found earlier.

After setting up my food and lighting a fresh fire, I sat on my sleeping bag and picked up the journal. I flipped it open to the first page and began to read.

The first passages felt simple enough, descriptions of daily life, observations of neighbors, the excitement and trepidation of starting fresh. She wrote about life in England, the decision to leave it all behind, and the first time she laid eyes on the house. The dialect was a little tough to follow at first, but I got the hang of it. It felt so personal that it was almost overwhelming to read.

Her observations about her first few days here were fascinating, how everything felt strange, how every sound in the night felt new and alien. She talked about the neighbors, the local gossip, and the way people in this small New England town would gather at local events. She detailed a boy she fancied, an innocent crush that seemed to consume her thoughts. The pages brought alive a world that felt completely lost to time, a delicate web of thoughts, fears, and joys from someone long gone.

It was unexplainable to feel connected to her this way. It was like meeting a ghost, one who felt alive, real, and painfully human. The hours slipped by as I read, each passage a window into a life that felt so personal and so distant. I found myself wishing, in that moment, that my grandmother could have been here to read this.

I got to the next page, this one different than the previous. I read:

 *---------------------------------------*

*This morn I awoke with a heaviness in my breast, a most unshakable dread that clings to me still. The air within this ancient house is colder than the season should permit, as though the very stones themselves exhale a breath from the depths of time. A feeling hangs here, sinister and unseen, lurking in the shadows of darkened corners and shifting when my gaze wavers.*

*At night, the sounds are most disquieting. Faint steps, always faint, yet deliberate, tread unseen paths through the dim and drafty corridors. I have listened with great patience, convinced they are no natural sound of earthly origin. At first, I entertained the notion that it was but the old timbers settling beneath the weight of age, but no. These are footsteps with purpose, footsteps that linger, that follow, that watch. They are not wholly of this house.*

*Last night, as I lay in my bed, I thought I spied a shadow in the gloom, a frail, sinister sliver of motion just beyond the edge of the door. My heart leapt within my chest, and I grasped at my prayer book as though it might offer me protection from the unseen. Yet it is no prayer that shall save me should this presence indeed prove real. The sensation of being watched is akin to a cold, unseen hand at the nape of my neck, unyielding and vile.*

*This morning, I spoke of these matters to Henry, careful with my words lest I appear as one given to flights of fancy. His gaze, pale and grey as the mist, met mine, yet he said not a word. Perhaps he thinks I am but given to idle imaginings.*

*But I am not accustomed to such things. I feel them, night and day. This house holds secrets, ancient and restless things. I fear they are no mere figments of my mind. I fear they watch me.*

  *---------------------------------------*

I sat for a moment, considering the words I read. I decided to stop there, not wanting to get any further. That night, I went to bed a little more restlessly, Noticing the sounds of the old home more. Every creak of the old wood sounding just a bit louder.

I woke the next morning after a restless night of tossing and turning, my body aching and my throat sore again. I’d hardly slept at all. My muslces hurt from the previous day’s work, and the thought of getting back out into the yard to clear more brush didn’t appeal to me in the slightest.

I managed to force myself outside for a couple of hours, shoveling dirt, pulling stray branches, and trying to make some progress. But by mid-morning, my body had other plans. My hands trembled, my back ached, and I knew I’d hit my limit. I packed it in and went inside, deciding that today wasn’t going to be a day for hard labor.

I figured a change of scenery might clear my head. I drove into town to a cozy little coffee shop. There was always something about the warm smell of coffee and the sound of people chatting that made me feel better. I brought the journal with me, thinking I might spend some time reading while I was there. I tucked it under my arm as I parked my car and headed inside, glad for the idea of a warm drink and a break from the house for a while.

With a coffee in-hand, I grabbed a chair by the window and decided to dive back into the journal. The next entry was as follows:

  *---------------------------------------*

*This day finds me in a state of profound unease, a weakness that clings to me as though my very soul has been sapped. I wake each morn with the sun, yet there is no vigor in my limbs, no strength in my bones. It is as though some unseen weight bears upon me, pressing down upon me through every hour.*

*The nights are worse. Last eve, as I lay in my bed with the wind howling without, I could hear them again, footsteps. They came from above, deliberate, heavy, yet there is no one there. My hand clutched at my prayer book as though it might shield me from these sounds, but it is of no use. The sound is constant, scraping, shuffling. Sometimes, they cease, as though waiting, and I lie in the dark, listening, with my heart in my throat.*

*The walls, too, seem to be alive with a kind of whispering. A scratching, faint and cruel, as if something moved within them, unseen and hungry. I have tried to convince myself that it is the old house settling, that the sound of age and wood might be mistaken for something sinister. Yet, I know better. I know he is there. I hear him.*

*Last night, when I dared leave my bed to see to the door, my breath caught in my chest. Through the crack of the door, which I had left ajar, I swore I saw it. An eye. A great, round, glimmering eye, pale as bone and fixed upon me with an unyielding stare. I froze as though the very sight had turned me to stone, and I dared not move, nor breathe, nor pray. The feeling is one I cannot describe, for it is as though the darkness knows my heart, as though it sees into me.*

*I fear I am going mad. I feel it in the daytime as well, this presence, a kind of languid despair that creeps into my bones. I am powerless here. I feel the energy of my life draining, as though this house has set its teeth into me and refuses to let go.*

*I pray this is but my own fancy, my mind given over to nerves and strain. But the sounds persist, and the eye lingers. I fear the day I will see it again. I fear the day, I shall not merely see it through the crack but see it here, beside me.*

  *---------------------------------------*

*What the hell was going on with her?* I wondered to myself. Was she going crazy? Was the isolation getting to her? I felt bad for her in that moment. Away from the house and in a new setting, I was certain she was experiencing some sort of mental health crisis, not understood properly during that time. I read on.

  *---------------------------------------*

*This entry comes with trembling hand and a heart that beats as though it would burst from my chest. I scarcely know how to put these things to paper, for words seem a poor defense against the horrors that now plague me. The eye, that dreadful, unyielding eye, hath returned. I see it again, always through cracks, through the narrowest fissures in doors, through the space at their edges. It watches me, cold and unblinking, as though it hath the power to see into the very depths of my soul. It is no longer confined to my bedchamber alone. Nay, I see it now in every door, those leading to the parlour, to the hallway, to the old kitchen. A terrible, pale orb that waits, and watches, and knows me.*

*Last night, I awoke with a jolt, my breath ragged, to see it once more. This time, not merely a hint or shadow, but a full sight, clear in its terrible form. A tall, frail figure stood beside me in the bed, lit only by the cold, pale glow of the moonlight streaming through the window. I could not move, could scarcely breathe, for my terror was as sharp as a knife. I dared not look for long, lest the sight take hold of my reason.*

*I reached for the spill, hands trembling, and lit the candles by my bed. The light grew warm and golden, dancing across the walls and ceiling, and yet when the flame touched the shadows, the figure was gone. As though it had never been. My heart ached with doubt, but the fear remained, cold and cruel. I could not shake the certainty that it would return, that it had been there, and that it would come again.*

*I feel as though the time is near, that some sinister design is being carried out upon me, some foul and terrible thing that I cannot prevent nor escape. It watches, and I feel its unseen plans growing, twisting, tightening like the grip of a noose.*

*I dread what will come next. Will I awaken again to find it beside me? Or will it come through the door, its intentions manifest and unyielding? My mind grows more frantic with each passing hour. I do not know how much longer I can endure this torment, this feeling that something waits, always waits, to bring about its cruel design.*

  *---------------------------------------*

I set the journal down for a moment, running my hand over my face. A chill had run up my spine, and I couldn’t shake the feeling. My chest felt tight, and I wondered if I should stop reading. What if this was a mistake? I didn’t want to let old fears and old stories get to me.

Maybe I should put it aside, I thought. Maybe reading this was only going to make me more anxious, make me think things I shouldn’t. The old house, the old journal, the strange things written within, it  was creepy, but it could all just be the ramblings of a lonely 19^(th) century woman. People were more superstitious back then, after all. And yet, I felt bad for her. There was so much fear in her words, so much desperation.

But no. It wasn’t real, was it? I tried to convince myself of that. These things always feel bigger when you’re alone, when you’re worn out or stuck in a dark house. It was probably nothing, a creak from wood or a draft coming in through the cracks in the walls. That was all. I wasn’t going to let this make me afraid to go back to the house.

I picked the journal back up, trying to shake off the tension. I wasn’t going to let it get to me. I’d finish reading this, and it would all make sense. Maybe she worked through it. Maybe she found out it wasn’t anything at all in the end. These old stories often have a way of building themselves up, don’t they? Fear out of nothing. That’s what I’d tell myself. It was fine. I’d just keep reading.

  *---------------------------------------*

*This hand trembles as I write, and my breath comes quick at the very act of putting this to paper. I can scarce hold my quill pen, my fingers so weak and cold, for I know this shall be my last. My soul feels as though it hangs by but a single thread, stretched taut with every passing moment.*

*I awoke again in the dead of night, as though from some restless dream. My heart leapt in my chest at the sight of it, a figure standing at the foot of my bed, as real as the shadows themselves. It watched me, cold and pale, a horrible, unyielding stare. I could not move, nor cry out. I could scarcely breathe. The eyes, those dreadful, pale eyes, followed me, and they were everywhere.*

*Not merely in my bedchamber, nay. It lingered in every darkened corner, through every crack and shadow, in the spaces between doors and walls. It watches me as I went about my duties in the house. It watches me as I descended the stairs or ventured into the kitchen. No matter the place, the gaze is there, unyielding, unblinking, and filled with a terrible knowing.*

*I could not bear it any longer. I made up my mind to confront it, to stare back, to ask it what it wanted of me. Perhaps I could command it away, or find some understanding, some explanation to silence this torment. I rose from my bed, trembling, and took a step toward the door. My hand grasped the handle, my heart pounding with a kind of fury I cannot explain. I pushed the door open, my breath hitching.*

*And there, from the dark, came a hand. It was black as pitch, thin and claw-like, and it reached from behind the door with a slow, creeping motion, like the very hand of death. I could see it through the faint glow of moonlight, gnarled and terrible, grasping toward me. My breath came out in a strangled cry, and I turned and fled.*

*I ran, felt as though I was pursued by all the devils of hell down the narrow hallway, my legs weak beneath me. My voice was lost, and my body moved of its own volition as I sought the only refuge I could find. I hurled open the door and locked it behind me, my hands shaking as I drew the bolt.*

*I sit here now at this very desk as I record what I fear are my final thoughts. The sound persists. The doorknob is moving, rattling against the lock, and I can hear the groan of it as though it is alive. It seeks entry. Perhaps it shall come for me at last. Perhaps my words will be the last act of defiance, the last testament to my fear, my frailty, my hope.*

*But if this is to be my end, then so be it. I fear it no lon*

  *---------------------------------------*

The entry stopped there. I flipped through to the next page to find it empty, as well as the rest of the journal. That was her final entry.

With the sun setting, I knew it was time to head back to the house. I couldn’t stay in the coffee shop forever, and until I got my big payday, I couldn’t afford a hotel. The thought of returning to the house filled me with unease, but I reminded myself why I was here: the faster I got the place fixed up, the faster I could sell it and walk away with more money than I had ever seen. That was the goal, and it was worth enduring a little discomfort, or so I told myself.

By the time I pulled into the driveway, it was dark outside. I parked and forced myself inside, telling myself it was just another night. The journal and its entries were still fresh in my mind, but I chalked it all up to the ramblings of an isolated, frightened woman. This wasn’t reality. This was just an old house.

I settled in for the evening, flicking on a lamp to chase away the dark corners. As I tried to focus on a book, something caught my eye. A faint movement, a pale circle, unmoving, peering at me from the narrow crack of a door across the hall. My heart leapt, and for a long moment, I couldn’t move. It was an eye. It was the eye. Watching me, I was sure of it.

But when I blinked and forced myself to look again, it was gone. Nothing but the shadow of the door and my overactive imagination. ""This damn house is getting to me,"" I muttered, shaking my head. I closed the book and turned in for the night, determined to put it all behind me.

Sleep didn’t come easily. Every creak of the house seemed amplified. At times, I thought I heard movement in the walls, soft, deliberate, like something dragging itself along inside them. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, but I told myself it was just the age of the house. Still, the feeling of being watched persisted, keeping me glancing over my shoulder.

At some point, exhaustion overtook me, and I drifted into a fitful sleep. Sometime during the night, I woke suddenly. I felt frozen, a deep, primal fear washing over me. I knew something was wrong, and I wasn’t alone. I didn’t want to look, but I forced myself to, becoming aware of something standing in the doorway.

It was tall, dark, its frame thin. Its outline was indistinct, but the eyes… the eyes glowed faintly in the darkness, pale and unblinking, looking directly at me. My breath caught in my throat as terror ran through me. I couldn’t move, couldn’t think. I was frozen in pure fear.

And then it shifted, ever so slightly, as though it were about to step forward. That was enough to snap me out of my frozen state. I bolted upright with some kind of instinctual, pathetic whimper, but the figure was gone. The doorway stood empty, and the room was quiet.

I didn’t wait. Grabbing my keys, I fled the house, stumbling onto the front lawn gasping for air. My heart pounded in my ears, and tears streaked down my face as I glanced back at the house. And that’s when I saw it again.

Peaking from around the edge of the front door, just visible in the dim light, was a shadow, and those eyes. Pale. Watching me.

I didn’t stick around to see what it would do next. I got in my car and drove away, the house shrinking in my rearview mirror, but the image of those eyes is forever burned into my mind.

I know now what my great-great grandmother went through was real, I saw it myself. I don’t know what happened to her, but I know she must have met a terrible fate. I never went back to the house, and I never will. I want nothing to do with it. I called Samuel Drake and told him I wanted to sell the house as is. I don’t care what I get for it at this point, I just want it out of my possession as quickly as possible.

1hba99p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hba99p/looks_arent_everything_a_notsohot_take/,Looks Aren't Everything: A Not-So-Hot Take,"Let's talk about this ridiculous notion that ""average"" guys can't compete in the dating world. As a solid 8 who's been hit on more times than a piñata at a kids party, I can confidently say that looks are *way* overrated. 

I mean, sure, it's nice to make out with Johnny Bravo, but it gets old *real* quick. What I, and I’d dare say most women, really want is a guy who can hold a conversation about something other than himself, and who doesn't treat me like a conquest. 

My best dates and relationships have been with guys who were... well, *normal*. I've dated guys who were shorter than me, skinnier than me, and… we’ll just say not always blessed in the looks department. But they had *personality*. They could quote obscure movies, debate the merits of different pizza toppings, and actually listen to what I had to say. 

Can we all just agree that being a decent human being is a much sexier quality than six-pack abs? Because I'm *so* tired of going out with guys who think they're doing me a favor by asking me out. 

And I'm not talking about ""nice guys"" who ""treat a girl right.""
I have a job, I'm a goddamn grown up who can buy a cup of coffee.

So, to all the ""average"" guys out there: Keep being you. The world needs more kind, funny, and genuinely interesting people.

Rant Over.

Now, if you'll excuse me: I'm going to go and see if I can find myself a guy who has a thesis-length argument about the right way to frost Christmas cookies.",5,1733859616.0,dating,16,0.61,False
1hba865,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1hba865/chest_pain_after_consuming_caffeine/,Chest pain after consuming caffeine ,"Im a 21M that has been drinking caffeine almost daily for about a year. 

I don’t drink tons of caffeine, but I do drink enough to feel jittery. I’d say about one cup of strong coffee a day, sometimes with addition to some matcha tea.

Recently though, I’ve been trying to stop. But in the past two weeks, when I’ve had caffeine I’ll get tightness and discomfort in the left side of my chest, close to where my heart is located.

Today, I had one cup of green tea, so not much caffeine, but felt an energy boost.

A few minutes after, I had felt the tightness in my chest come back, and worse than before.

I’ve never had any reaction like this to caffeine, and it’s only started to happen in the past two weeks as I’ve almost completely stopped consumption. 

Also as a note, I’m in college and am under stress, but try to mitigate it. Should I go to the doctor asap?

I laughed it off, shouted back, “Yeah, saving it for tomorrow!” and kept shovelling. Next thing I know, he’s walking over with his snowblower, and within five minutes, my whole driveway is clear. I was just standing there holding my shovel like an idiot.

I tried to thank him, and he said, ""Now you owe me a coffee.” Like, how could I not?” and just walks back to his place. Obviously, I showed up the next day with a double-double for him.

1hba3kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1hba3kq/vegan_food_i_had_in_osaka_miyajima_himeji_kyoto/,Vegan food I had in Osaka - Miyajima - Himeji - Kyoto - Tokyo,"This sub was super helpful, but threads about vegan food is far and in between and did not cover some of my fav in my trip. So I'll be putting down a list of vegan restaurants (plus super vegan friendly places) I ate at during my trip. I found information via Happy Cow, Google map lists (I kept multiple), and instagram accounts, and sometimes a google maps search finds the lesser known places.

The ordering per city reflects how much I liked the place, but city order is my reverse travel order. I put Tokyo first because that's where my top 3 are. I was with family so we ordered different things and share. 

Super long post incoming.

**Tokyo**

[**Loving Hut Tokyo Nishi-Nippori**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/puoTcc2K287MbRYk8)

* My Number 1 meal(s) in Japan, even though it's a long trek out from the nearest JR/Metro line, only open at some specific times of the week, it's well worth the planning and the trip!
* All the rice sets are GREAT. They were so good the two of us ate in and got 2 sets and went back to the counter and ordered another 2 bento as well.
* Soy and lotus root 'eel' especially had the right amount of Chinese peppercorn on it that adds that extra dimension of flavor. I love it when Chinese peppercorns is there by itself (without super hot chilli).
* Karaage had perfect texture. It is a rather more textured-soy texture which I personally love, but may not be what you expect if you were expecting Izakaya Masaka karaage.
* Hamburger was actually Japanese style? She made it out of some kind of loose soy something, was great, served with some kind of tomato sauce (not ketchup).
* Mapo tofu was surprisingly good and left me wanting more Japanese style mapo tofu.
* In each rice set, there was a great variety of really great side dishes, there was salad, a tiny curry korokke, some pickles (fresh cucumber and sesame daikon, neither is too salty) and a small amount of dessert (coconut cream sweet potatoes in ours). The soup has a good amount of veggies, not mostly liquid like a lot of other miso soups we've had this trip.
* I also ordered the mugwort cake. The sweetness level is very light to highlight the mugwort taste. Make sure you eat in so it's warmed up with fresh tofu cream.
* The sushi needs to be pre-ordered, which is a shame, but turns out I might have loved the hot foods more than the sushi.
* Did I mention it's very reasonably priced for Tokyo? If you order the rice sets togo (same amount of food as dine in minus soup), the prices becomes outright amazing.
* **Recommend:** Everything, but ""Eel"" and Mapo tofu in particular.

T's Tantan Ramen 

* Not putting a google maps link for this one since it has so many branches including the airports! But that's for a VERY good reason, their ramen is simply AMAZING! My Number 2 in Japan, almost tied for Number 1. 
* Golden Sesame TanTan is the promoted ramen that's plastered all over the place for a good reason. It really is GREAT. I accidentally ordered Konjac noodles instead of large portion noodles, but it still fit amazingly in this ramen and its broth.
* The autumn seasonal soy sauce(?) ramen was also amazing. In this bowl I managed to order the large portion of wheat noodles I initially wanted, and it's like DOUBLE the amount of noodles haha, we ended up scooping the extra noodles into the Sesame tantan broth and it's also great.
* Their wheat noodle is what I envisioned good Japanese ramen to be. Maybe it's not handmade (they are a chain after all) but it really hits my spot.
* Both broths are very drinkable.
* Did I mention their prices are amazing too?
* Their cup ramen is my top cup noodle now! Comes with veggies that somehow become super fresh after rehydration. Had them hot on Zipair. If your Zipair flight offers them, go for it! It costed us 500 yen per cup which was fine with us since they bring it to you with hot water already in it. But you should also buy some from convenience stores if you see any! (They cost more from the restaurant for some reason)
* **Recommend:** Golden Sesame Tantan, konjac noodle (at least once), cup ramen (from supermarket or conbini).

[VEGAN GYOZA YU](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fgtnVgEgTyQSjz4R8)

* A bit of a walk from JR/metro stations, but also worth it. My Number 3 favorite in Japan
* They serve one thing only and does it VERY WELL. Multi-colored, super instagrammable dumplings, hand made from filling to wrapper. 
* The wrapper is LEGIT. Hand made, fresh, no fillers or preservatives. I know because I make my own dumpling wrappers from scratch too.
* Each colored dumpling has its own flavor, we only ordered steamed, since we both wanted steamed more than pan-fried, and gyoza isn't really sharable.
* The best one is Shiitake. They gave each set 2 of Shiitake because one of their flavors (some kind of fresh pickled cabbage?) was seasonal only... But at least there was 2 of the best flavor!
* Each gyoza has a rather different flavor, all of them good, some of them GREAT. 
* The reason this place is only number 3 in my books is because some flavors are a tad salty, had to drink a lot of water. I mentioned this to the server (who spoke English) but she said that some people still wanted soy sauce with their dumplings...???
* As a side note, I consider dumplings that requires soy sauce/some kind of salty sauce WEAK since that means their fillings does not have enough flavor. Not a problem in this gyoza place!
* **Recommend:** They only have 1 set meal, I love the steamed version, can't say anything about pan-fried but it looks good without being too oily.

[KOMEDA is □ Higashi Ginza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DF9pB8arVcPtoPoT6)

* One of Japan's favorite chain kissaten but the only vegan branch in the entire nation (for now, hopefully)
* Open super early for breakfast, has a good value breakfast deal. But it's only good if you like fluffy puffy Japanese bread.
* I liked their sandwiches a lot more! Great variety too.
* A non-vegan Japanese friend ordered a burger (they have burgers but with Japanese style sauces), and said it tasted so good he won't have guessed it's vegan!
* We should have eaten here a lot more often...
* **Recommend:** Sandwiches! And maybe burger.

[hal okada vegan patisserie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHXFyXadzcigudvs5)

* Not near any sightseeing spots I wanted to go to, but I've also been following their instagram for ages so I just had to go.
* Fresh, packed super well, survived me careless carrying it around through shopping and trains. I got a cheesecake that was gone far too fast for my own good.
* **Recommend:** Yes. (whatever they have on day of your visit)

[Injoy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1MwXWkrfEgURzqv26)

* Taiwanese vegan place really near Asakusa metro. But food isn't exactly Taiwanese.
* Lunch sets have a good amount of food and veggies, but also gets bundled with expensive herbal tea that tastes of ginseng.
* Best item is bibimbap surprisingly, the stone pot is actually hot so you get crispy rice at the bottom.
* **Recommend:** Bibimbap! Dandan noodle is fine too.

[Hatoya’s Vegan Fruit Sandwiches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HGdL5JXxfKvHQ97K9)

* Conveniently located near Sensoji, but inconveniently only open at 11am which is when all the crowd is there too.
* It's exactly what it looks like, soy cream filled sandwiches with fruits in them.
* I got a strawberry one. The hidden ""corner"" of the triangle shaped sandwich bread, did, in fact contain more strawberry.
* Soy cream tastes very fresh. But in the end, it tastes like exactly what is said on the tin, white Japanese bread, fruit, sweet cream. Not something I actively crave or dream about.
* There are 2 vegan fruit sandwich places in Tokyo, but I chose to have it here since it's near Sensoji.
* **Recommend:** I think it's seasonal, but strawberry should always be on the options.

[SUNDAY VEGAN](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9fPjrShLZMvsbhbE6)

* The reason to walk between Ghibli museum and Kichijoji Station.
* They only have sweet donuts and maybe tea/coffee, but one of the best sweet donut I've ever had. (and I've had them aplenty all across California)
* Got the staff recommended soy cream filled donut and chocolate erm, square shaped donut? Don't remember the name. But both are light and fluffy to perfection
* JUST the right level of sweetness.
* **Recommend:** Soy cream filled donut, but best ask the friendly shop staff who speaks basic English.

[AIN SOPH. Soar IKEBUKURO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q4cD5LdeaVfgXqfZ7)

* I avoided Ain Sophs around Tokyo/Kyoto since the menu looks pretty Western without the localization changes in sauces like Komeda Is \_ but they are in good locations.
* Took a brief snack here between shopping, so only got a small salad and single side of soy cutlet.
* The one meal item I wanted to try from them (mushroom hayashi rice) was OOS that day... 
* Soy cutlet tastes fine, has with a crispy batter coat. White sauce significantly better than black.
* Small salad comes with good dressing and a few small bits of avocado. Surprisingly tasty.
* Don't miss their dessert menu! I did :(
* **Recommend:** Salad. Seriously. I'd have also ordered the Creme Brulee too but forgot about the dessert menu.

Tea shop inside Teamlab Borderless

* Everything is vegan but a bit overpriced, but you are paying for experience of having flowers in your tea and a flowering tree grow out of your icecream bowl.
* **Recommend:** Rice milk tea + ice cream. 

[8balish](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tpj6X2rvuVJCREqY8)

* Conveniently right across teamlabs Borderless, decent vegan food. 
* Menu looks a lot like what I'd find in the US instead of in Japan.
* The bagel with cream cheese was chewy and tough. Don't bother.
* The assorted tapas vegetables of the day with rice was decent.
* **Recommend:** Tapas set of the day, dessert. 

Honorable mention:  [Tofu maker in Asakusa 栃木家商店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h51CU1QdJSSuR1ZE9)

* Makes and sell fresh tofu products, we found them by accident by smelling the scent of freshly made tofu when walking a side street.
* Not everything is vegetarian, shop staff understands vegetarian but not much English, so knowing basic Japanese vocab about vegan food / Google translate helps.
* Sells a soy sauce +wasabi + chopsticks set for 50yen so you can eat the fresh soy products you just purchased.
* Their star product Asakusa Yuba is almost like drinking soy milk, I still like regular yuba more, but worth a try.
* The fried tofu patty-like thing turned out rather bland by itself, and with soy sauce it's still mediocre.
* **Recommend:** Abura-age (fried tofu sheet, lasts long without fridge). Yuba (only if you can eat it in a couple of hours, goes bad FAST). 

[Izakaya Masaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n46fBjNNvBsmNKnv7)

* The Shibuya mall it's in has a great Nintendo, Capcom, and other game/animanga stores on its top floor.
* The only time we had to wait for seats in Japan. People who arrived 10 minutes after us were refused entry, we got on the waiting list so we were ok.
* When we went in, a lot of items were sold out. No mapo tofu so we made do with karaage, which was was good tasting but not enough crispiness. This is a ""softer"" kind of mock meat, probably mimics chicken better? I've been vegan for too long to be able to tell.
* The crispy fried Maitake mushroom was more crispy but does not come with sauce and the batter tastes unsalted.
* Rice was left in steaming for WAY too long and has became mushy. Worst rice we had in Japan. Still worth it since you need rice for all the salty stuff, get the rice set.
* Gyoza was fine. Did not get burnt. The people next to us was served spring rolls that was charred.
* Mizuna salad was too salty+spicy and comes way before the rice, dressing and salt well not mixed well.
* Maybe this is an authentic izakaya experience? But prices aren't low for what you get. 
* **Recommend:** Karaage + rice set (maybe mapo tofu is better that's why it sold out). But you aren't missing out if you don't get to enter.

[Taiyaki Hiiragi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B8GWX5uMfVRDY3PE8)

* Vegan taiyaki (red bean filling). No queues.
* Filling is a tad too sweet, the fish shaped shell is crispy but a bit too thin. I preferred the Gozasoro pastries from Kansai region (later in this post).
* Only eat one if you have to have a vegan taiyaki near a metro station. I believe there is one other place with naturally vegan taiyaki called Nezu Taiyaki but that's a bit out of the way of metro, and has queues.

[Komaki Shokudo Kamakura Fushikian](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dHipu5eUFy7qLmqA6)

* Only (?) full vegan place in Akibahara, but you should seriously just take the JR to another station with T's Tantan instead, especially if it's dinner time. Or maybe I was scammed with tourist menu?
* I was charged 2200 yen for a tiny amount of udon, tiny amount of super tough green veggies, one piece of too-sweet aburaage, and broth that was too salty to drink. There's a tiny amount of rice to supposedly wash down that broth, but it's tiny.
* Not recommended.

**Kyoto**  
Interestingly, I did not love the food in Kyoto as much I expected. Maybe because quite a few of the places I wanted to go to were not open that day unannounced (Izakaya nijiya), or reservation recommended (and we were too tired to go and TRY, hindsight we should have tried), or they closed a few months ago... Don't rely on Happy Cow, Google Map search the word ""vegan"" gives more immediate vicinity results.

[Ramen Towzen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PL8insVTnhF7hoef8)

* Hard to get to, the wait for the bus to get there was LONG (bus timetables goes completely out of the window with Kyoto night traffic). Take a taxi. It'll make your meal a lot more enjoyable.
* The ramen itself was alright. Broth was good but maybe I just hyped myself up too much from all the waiting. I like T's in Tokyo better, especially their dandan.
* The highlight was the pressed eggplant sushi! I love my eggplant grilled.
* **Recommend:** Musashi ramen set (with eggplant sushi and salad). Tried both and this is the better one.

[silver backs cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HX82DLHRkxULM6Rr5)

* The logo looks exactly like the owner!
* Pretty tasty food, but menu had a lot of non-Japanese-ish foods like Pho and nachos? Nope, we were tourist to Kyoto and wanted only Japanese-ish foods! (like, Japanese style curry is ok, but I'm not ordering Thai green curry in Kyoto if I can help it). Nevertheless, it probably is a good thing for Japanese people to eat vegan food from all over the world.
* Ended up with the Japanese lunch set and grilled ""meat"" set.
* **Recommend:** grilled ""meat"" set, the wasabi dressing salad it comes with pairs very well with the mock meat.

[Vegetarian Cafe Ren Horikawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZFEVT9T4sohtfha38)

* A few bus stops north of Nijo castle, but they should have other chains as well. Turns out they speak Chinese better than their English. Taiwanese owner I think?
* Very varied menu, should have ordered more togo in hindsight.
* **Recommend:** Soy milk hotpot set. Comes with gyoza, which tastes like store bought but it's also one of my favorite brand of store bought gyozas.

[TORIBA COFFEE KYOTO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RPuL7hKNaSSViSrR8)

* ""walking"" distance from Meiji Jingu
* Their food items seem to be all vegan but their lattes seem to be milk by default? We aren't coffee people.
* Sandwiches seem to be tasty but portions are rather small.
* Their ""new item"" is It's a perfectly fried some kind of patty (with a tiny bit of veggies in it?). I love my crispy edges in fried foods.
* **Recommend:** ""Fish"" sandwich, ""katsu"" sandwich.

[Tenryuji Temple Shigetsu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R9hrGUeSVLGWt8E87)

* Most expensive, but far from my favorite place in Kyoto. I pre-ordered the Moon meal (6500yen) and it was a LOT of food.
* Fun dining experience, food is interesting but not the most tasty. The dishes are seasonal, so photos you see of that awesome grilled eggplant? Nope, not there if you go in the wrong season.
* The highlight of the meal was the yuba skin which I think comes with every other set too. The suspected Moon set extra dish was some kind of couscous and dango soup dish and the only thing to note is how filling it is.
* Way too much rice cake in our set. Maybe we just went in the wrong time? What's up with all the rice cakes?
* Tofu looking thing is some kind of nut tofu cake (other reviews say it's sesame but I also taste peanuts). Interesting texture, but one experience is enough.
* **Recommend:** reserve your place ahead of time, but stick to the 3800 yen set.

[MERCY Vegan Factory KYOTO STATION](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kVePjvapXPjGgW877)

* I regretfully had only time to grab some togo items, their menu looks amazing
* Great egg salad sandwich!
* However their crossiants/breads are super gluten-y (maybe their dough overdeveloped on that day?), one of the toughest soft bread I've had. Shame, the flavoring was great.
* **Recommend:** egg salad sandwich (but I should have went back and ordered something as dine in)

[CAFE TEA TERRACE (VEGAN, GLUTEN-FREE, VEGETARIAN)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e81KaG4EPte2jhyv5)

* Ramen soup was good, comes with decent amount of veggies, but noodle itself was millet based and has a pretty rough texture. I guess it's because they needed a gluten free food item? Celiac/gluten allergic people would appreciate this better than we did.
* Egg salad sandwich filling tasted JUST like the one from MERCY, but is in a thick toast pocket instead of fluffy plain bread, and I enjoyed this one more. I encountered the same claim of ""vegan pumpkin based egg salad"" sandwich in Toriba coffee too, so now I'm suspecting they are all from one single supplier (MERCY?).
* Dango set is too expensive for what it is, so they tried to make up for it by putting gold in the sesame sauce... the result is acceptable but not worth it.
* **Recommend:** egg salad sandwich (if you haven't had the one from MERCY or any other places in Kyoto.)

  
Honorable mention: 

[Gyomu Super Sanjo-kawaramachi Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ff4AKgXsRxgowiPj8) 

* Small supermarket in the middle of one of the busiest areas in Kyoto, but with SUPER CHEAP PRICES. It's where restaurants go and get their supplies.
* Never pay for edamame in a restaurant because you can get them for super cheap in here!
* They have decently priced fresh tofu, veggies, microwave rice, mochi... Enough for a half decent dinner/breakfast if you have access to a microwave.
* Not a lot of vegan instant food selection (didn't check their curry sauce section), so you may need to get some sauce. We opted for rubbing some salt from the pre-salted edamame instead...
* **Highly recommended if you want to save some money**

There was also a small stall selling tofu manju section in the back of Okutan Kiyomizu (which isn't vegan because of dashi, no idea how friendly they actually are). The tofu manju is vegan (the girl took out an ingredients card to check too). But it's skin is really sweet while the filling is a savory and NOT worth it.

**Himeji**

Because we rode the Hello Kitty Shinkansen here from Hiroshima which arrives at an odd time, we ended up eating lunch at almost 4pm after we finished exploring Himeji Castle and Koko-en. Koko-en, despite good reviews from this sub, is not worth it if it's not height of whatever season you are there, for us it's momiji season but there was hardly any red.

[il riccio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2UEQ2zDx4SFnFf91A)

* The only vegan place that's in between Himeji Castle and train station, follow Google Maps, past the ramen shop right next to it with big signs advertising their VEGAN NOODLE, ignoring their attempt to scam vegan tourists.
* The actual place is half-shop half restaurant. There was a few rice sets we could order. The lunch set of the day was delicious, as was the mushroom-and-gluten rice set. Some dishes are light on salt/soy sauce but you can also taste the flavor of ingredients.
* **Recommend:** lunch set of the day, cookies/bakery items
* There was a few vegan packet ramen in the shop (owner will very helpfully tell you the TRUE vegan ones without hidden dashi), but they were a hit-and-miss, since they aren't in cups so you need to get a microwave container to cook them as a tourist, and contains no freeze-dry veggies. Just noodle and soup.

**Miyajima**

[Rokaku Tea House (Hexagon Cafe)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RNHjo5MzYYFDzD4a7)

* Right next to the entrance after entering Daishoin temple, look for the cafe sign. Really cute temple! 
* I think they always have one rotating food item that's vegan. When we went, it's a very nicely plated curry rice, and there was a vegan soymilk pudding as well!
* Did not taste that much like Japanese curry (it tasted more Indian, but with very little heat) and had nuts in it. Great hot meal in a nice place.

Everything on Miyajima closes around 5pm, and we were tired from walking so did not check if any dinner places have decent vegan options, we just went back to our hotel and ate the brown rice sushi we packed from Osaka. There was a Lawson and Starbucks open, but I didn't go in to check for vegan options.

Hiroshima honorable mention:

[Gozasoro 御座候](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ev1CBAhzKoSATNQv7) (chain bakery of one single kind of Japanese sweet)

* The basic sweet itself is really cheap and naturally vegan, but this location in particular turns out to also sells pork meat buns as a side hustle. But that's in the steamer and the sweets are from the moulded pans.
* If you check Happy Cow, this chain is all over the place in train stations in Kansai. This just happen to be the location I visited, but because of the pork bun thing I'd probably visit another of their chain locations.
* The sweet itself is pretty good! They'll box it up really nicely for you so it remains warm after a few hours, not overly sweet and we could have it without tea. Both kinds of bean pastes tastes pretty freshly made, not packaged.

**Osaka**

[Brown Rice Sushi TEC 玄米のおすしテック ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VqL5CJLdSC2szSb36)

* Opens really early (7:30am). They have a great breakfast deal (before 8am)
* Walking distance from Shin Osaka station
* Only a small table for eating in, pack a lot of things if you the daytrip location you are visiting is inconvenient for vegan food. (for us, it's Miyajima at dinnertime)
* Fresh ingredients, especially the salad leaves they use, and somehow they stay fresh.
* **Recommend:** Chirashi sushi, and anything with their Koji Tofu and Tempeh.

[OKO Takoyaki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MRPS36j2RfMHkyBY6) 

* I've seen people confuse this place and their OKO Okonomiyaki location. The Okonomiyaki location is not fully vegan, just vegan friendly. This place is fully vegan.
* That said, I found the takoyaki a bit too soft and starchy. Probably because it's gluten free, so they had to use just starch/starchy vegetable to bind the okara. And it's rather oily.
* Veggies on kushikatsu are tiny. Is it supposed to be tiny?
* Cost wise, extremely good deal since it comes as a set with salad and soup, I liked the salad and kushikatsu better than the takoyaki.
* Given the choice to choose again, I might have gone to Pivot cafe which has takoyaki and other menu items too, or Shinsekai Paprika Shokudo but they are closed on the day we were in Osaka. 

If you read all the way till the end WOW. I wrote this list as a personal tracking thing, hopefully it'll will show up in search results to help others make food decisions in the future.

1hba3hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hba3hd/heart_pain_after_drinking_caffeine/,Heart pain after drinking caffeine,"Im a 21M that has been drinking caffeine almost daily for about a year. 

I don’t drink tons of caffeine, but I do drink enough to feel jittery. I’d say about one cup of strong coffee a day, sometimes with addition to some matcha tea.

Recently though, I’ve been trying to stop. But ever so often I’ll have just a bit, maybe a cup of tea or something. Whhen I do, I’ll get tightness and discomfort in the left side of my chest, close to where my heart is located.

Today, I had one cup of green tea, so not much caffeine, but felt an energy boost.

A few minutes after, I had felt the tightness in my chest come back, and worse than before.

I’ve never had any reaction like this to caffeine, and it’s only started to happen in the past two weeks as I’ve almost completely stopped consumption. 

Also as a note, I’m in college and am under stress, but try to mitigate it. Should I go to the doctor asap?

For some reason the company offers MANY discount and free drink vouchers. Given that we’re the only coffee shop in the area we get insanely busy. 


A lot of our costumers have some sort of voucher, the majority of which is free drinks. Some of them only ever use vouchers and they come everyday. Given that they use vouchers, about half of the drinks are labour intensive to make the most out of the discount. 

The thing is, the company refuses to give us more labour hours given that “we don’t make enough money”, which is fair enough but also they’re the ones handing out the discounts? We lose about 700£ a day in discounts so each of us has to basically do the job of 2 people for the same pay, we also have been regularly having to stay 40mins to an hour overtime to finish the tasks that we couldn’t do when it was busy, most of the time we don’t even get paid for it. This is a bigger issue in our store as I worked in other stores within the company and they don’t seem to get that many discounts.

# Background

I’ve been running for 14ish years, and training for performance in the past 3-4. Prior to CIM I’d run two marathons: the first in October 2021, 3:05:56 off about 30-35mpw, and the second in April 2023, 2:44:36 off 50mpw. I train for other distances too, but since this is a marathon race report those are the most relevant data points!

# Training overview

2024 hadn’t been a fantastic year running wise. I was training pretty well in the spring but was also in the final semester of a PhD program, and with the stress of finishing up my dissertation, never managed to piece things together for a solid race performance. After submission I totally crashed, and there followed several weeks where I could barely run five miles without feeling super fatigued. I eventually took a week totally off, starting back when I was feeling more like myself, but promptly injured my foot, which knocked me out for another \~5 weeks in the early summer. By the time I started my marathon build in July, I was on the back foot fitness-wise, but also really hungry for some success.

Anyone interested in what my build looked like as a whole is welcome to look at my CIM training spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AUdofPQiRzdjBA4yaFpkhoINFXl1M6PW3\_nz03xyQ2c/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AUdofPQiRzdjBA4yaFpkhoINFXl1M6PW3_nz03xyQ2c/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0)

It’s a long build—22 weeks, comprising six weeks of base training (after I’d rebuilt mileage post-injury), eight weeks of transitional or “special” training, six weeks of “specific” training, and a two-week taper. I ended up averaging about 60mpw—not as much as I’d originally hoped to hit, but still a good 10% increase on my previous marathon build. (My year-to-date mileage is sitting at 2,373 atm, which is the most I’ve ever run.) My supplemental cross-training and strength work sort of fell off a cliff halfway through the build--I moved across coasts to start a new job in early September, which really shook up my routines.

I’m self-coached, and an avid reader of the amazing [Running Writings blog](https://runningwritings.com/), and I leant heavily on the resources John has written interpreting Renato Canova’s training philosophies in structuring my build/designing workouts. I’ve been interested in Canova-style training for a while, and have incorporated a few of his principles into my running before, but this was my first attempt to design an entire build in this style (what runningwritings calls ""[full-spectrum training](https://runningwritings.com/2023/12/percentage-based-training.html)""). This involves percentage-based workouts that evolve to be gradually more race-specific as the weeks progress, punctuated by ""block"" training days (or double workout days) at key points. I want to focus a section of my report on these block days, as I think they’re a training strategy that others in the community might find useful.

# Canova-style block workout days

It’s worth briefly distinguishing the goal of block days from that of double threshold training, a different double-workout strategy that’s had a lot more press in recent years. Broadly speaking, double threshold aims to maximize workout volume over the build as a whole: by running double sessions that are individually lighter and less intense (typically executed above LT1 but backed off from LT2), the athlete is able to spend more total time at a productive workout intensity than they might do running relatively bigger or more intense single sessions. Canova-style block days differ in that they aren’t implemented week-in week-out during training, but periodically, typically once every 3-4 weeks during the ""special"" and ""specific"" phases of a training block (the last \~12 weeks before the race). As such, the purpose is not so much to increase the overall training stimulus as to *vary* it. I suspect this difference makes block days a more useable strategy for amateur athletes—most of us aren’t nearly maxed out on training to the degree that makes consistent double threshold work a logical next step, but the principle of changing up the rhythm of your training to accommodate a few extra-large servings of intensity/volume seems fairly portable across different ability levels.

Of course, theory and practice are two different things. Most of the info about block days out there is centered on the elite, high-volume athletes Canova actually coaches, and the sample workouts I’ve seen look pretty bonkers (there are some examples listed in[ this article](https://runningscience.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The-Methods-of-Renato-Canova.pdf) if you're curious). As someone who runs half the volume of Canova’s athletes, and is somewhat injury-prone to boot, I obviously had to adapt the concept quite a bit. I aimed for workouts that had the shape and spirit of Canova’s block days, that would tax me in a new way, but would also build proportionally from training I’ve carried out before.

I scheduled four blocks, two falling in the ‘special’ training phase of my build (which focuses on training intensities between 90-95% and 105-110% of MP) and two in the ‘specific’ phase (95-105% MP). On the spreadsheet I linked above, they’re the four darkest green days. Here’s how they went:

**Special block 1**

AM: 8 mi @ 90% MP (\~6:19). PM: 5 x (4 x 400 @ 110% MP) off 20”/40” (\~83).

**Special block 2**

AM: 8 mi @ 95% MP (\~6:11). PM: 8 x 1000 @ 105-110% MP off 60” (\~3:30).

**Specific block 1**

AM: 8 mi @ 98-100% MP (\~6:03). PM: 10k alternating between 105% and 95% MP (3:32/3:51)

**Specific block 2**

AM: 8 mi @ MP (\~5:57). PM: 8 mi @ MP (\~5:55)

To benefit from these sessions, you need to go into them well rested and recover fully after, so other than strides, I’d just run easy for 2-3 days before and 3-4 days following each block. I was pretty nervous in the lead up to every single one, always expecting the second workout to feel terrible, but surprisingly they all went really well. Like clockwork, my legs would feel heavy during the warm-up for the second session then loosen up after a mile or so of jogging, then the workout itself would feel smooth. I should also mention that these ended up being pretty huge days in terms of overall volume—20-23 miles between the two sessions. This seems to me to be an added benefit of doing block days as an amateur marathoner—they provide another avenue (beyond long runs) for you to work on running efficiently in a fatigued state.

# Training reflections / goal-setting

Tbh I spent a good amount of this training block feeling average-to-bad. (I imagine the mid-build move/new job had a lot to do with this.) It wasn’t really until the last \~six weeks of training that I started feeling like I had my legs beneath me. But I do think I responded to that final race-specific phase of the build really well.

I ran a 1:15:12 half marathon in mid-October on a fairly hilly course, and my subsequent long marathon pace workouts suggested that a \~6:00-6:05 race pace was realistic. My final block workout day totting up to 16 miles of sub-6 MP (and feeling really relaxed!) had me fantasizing about something faster, but I wanted to prioritize 1) executing a good marathon and 2) breaking 2:40. Both of my previous marathons had been significant positive splits, and I wanted to know what it felt like to enter the last 10k of the race with some power in my legs.

# The race

I was running in the elite field, and we were given space in a building near the start line to stay warm and hang out beforehand. There were coffee and bagels there, and I sipped on half a cup of coffee about an hour before the start. I think this was probably a mistake, as I was peeing non-stop after that during my warmup. I got to the start line still needing to go, and my bladder was all I could think about for the first few miles of the race. By mid-way through mile four, I had to accept that this wasn’t just a nerves thing that would go away, so I dipped into the next set of porta-potties on the course. Per the idle time in my activity, this break cost me 23 seconds. But I’m glad I didn’t just try to suck it up—I felt a lot better afterwards, and was able to relax into the race and enjoy myself.

The course is everything it’s hyped up to be. The downhill is gentle enough that you can take advantage of it, and the rollers (through about mile 16) break things up and allow you to use different muscles (or use them in different ways). Conditions were perfect, the competition was deep, and the crowds showed up. 10/10 on all fronts!

Having already taken one pee break, I was a bit nervous about consuming fluids. I had access to bottles on the course with Tailwind in them, but I barely drank more than a sip or two until about mile 18. Knowing that I had access to easily accessible fluids at future stations made this less of a risky strategy than it sounds, I think—I’m fairly sure that in a cool race you don’t *need* fluids unless you’re actually thirsty (which I wasn’t until late on), and with the bottles I knew I’d be able to drink to thirst when the time came. The Tailwind was kind of an added bonus in terms of my carb intake--I planned to take six gels (a combo of UCAN, Velcro-ed to my bottles, and Precision gels from the general aid stations), which averages about 60g per hour. So I didn’t *need* the sports mix, but having access to it definitely gave me options, and allowed me to adapt to how I was feeling mid-race.

I’ve never had a marathon go by so quickly. I wanted it to feel relaxed for as long as possible, so I just settled into the effort and tried not to look at my watch beyond lapping at the mile markers. I expected my splits to be a little bumpy with the rollers but they stayed pretty consistent, and the miles just flew by. My quads were noticeably sore by 16, which was some cause for concern, but once this soreness set in it didn’t seem to get a lot worse. With hindsight I suppose this makes sense, since the downhills were basically done by this point, but I was starting to pass people who were cramping or blowing up, so there was a lot of nervous checking in with myself from 16-18.

As I passed the mile 18 marker, I remember thinking “just an 8-mile MP tempo—you’ve done this a bunch of times.” And somehow this prospect didn’t actually seem too daunting to me. I knew that it was still possible things could take a turn for the worse, but I felt calm. At Boston last year, it was around heartbreak hill that I lost power, so mile 20 felt like the deciding moment where I'd actually know what I had. When I passed the 20 marker still in control, still on pace, I started to feel less vigilant about what my body was doing. My focus switched—I began searching the runners ahead of me for women to reel in, and the very fact that I was in a position to do this made me *so happy*. I wasn’t just executing a pace plan now, I was *racing!*  (According to the standings, I was able to pass 10 women in that last 10k, moving up 57 places overall.)

A cool feature of CIM is that they give their top women a separate finish line. My friend was waiting there--she took a video of me coming around the turn (which I take it too wide but oh well), and I look strong in it. I’m proud of that final kick—if my watch is to be believed, I hit a sub-5 pace at some point in the last 200 meters of the race, which is pretty nuts if true.

# Post-race

I was a bit stunned to have finished at first and it took a few minutes to gather myself and let everything sink in. It’s embarrassing but I’ve cried after every marathon I’ve run, I guess that’s just how my body responds to exhaustion. Steph Bruce (who came 3^(rd)) was watching the women’s finish and I got to chat with her for a bit—she was so warm and genuine. Then I went to find my other teammates, all of whom ran brilliant races as well (shout out to u/theyare_coming on his huge, long-awaited, and very well-deserved PR <3 ). Celebratory vibes all round!

# Parting thoughts / what’s next

I’m happy with this season on a few levels. I think I wrote ambitious but sensible training for myself, and gained some solid insight and data points for future builds. I hit my time goal, but I also ran a strong race. And I *was able*, latterly, to race! I'm proud of that. The marathon is hard, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.

Now the plan is to rest up and be ready to start work on some faster stuff in the new year. I want to run a proper track season—spike up, race a bunch, break my mile PR, and hopefully my 5k PR as well. I haven’t thought about how to approach all of that yet training-wise, so suggestions are welcome. I also really need to work on my mileage. From what I’ve been able to gather about the kind of training the women placing ahead of me are doing, it’s kind of stupid to hope to compete with them with my volume where it is. But the flipside is (hopefully) that there’s plenty of room left to grow.

**then juuls, zyns and disposables came out**, and **i went from a social nicotine user to a 24/7 nicotine user**. all day, **365 days a year** – i **went from using nicotine \~25% of the time** with no cravings during the week **to using nicotine 100%** of the time with cravings any time i didn’t have it in my hand – **a 75% increase in usage**, and step in the wrong direction.

**up until 10/25/24, when i threw my vape away**. i originally had planned a quit for 1/1/25 since i usually do dry january with my wife but just ended up tossing it early to see how long i could go. i went cold turkey, no nrt. **the first 2-3 weeks were fucking brutal**.

**however, since that date, i’ve drunkenly hit someone’s vape while out a total of three nights**, more in line with my original nicotine use. never bought my own, never caved on the idea of going back to doing it daily, etc.

so **on one hand, i went from a nicotine user 100% of the time to a nicotine user 5% of the time – a 95% decrease compared to the baseline** that had been set for the last couple year stretch. but i **can’t really say i “quit” 46 days ago because i hit it drunk a couple times**. 

however, mentally it seems like **i am back in that mentality of not thinking about it during the week and really only wanting to have a taste of nicotine when i’m properly drunk**, which is at maximum 1x per week. i think the mistake i made in the past was saying i could “vape on weekends” regardless of if i was in/out/sober/drinking where as more recently it is truly just like hammered, taking a puff of my wife’s vape once or twice a month and never having my own or touching it when i’m not actually hammered.

i **still want to carry on intentionally not vaping and i’m even planning to not binge drink on new years eve and do dry january because i want my brain to continue resetting fully without interruptions**, even though i’ve **been lucky they haven’t set me back to square one or somehow really even set me back at all** (i’m assuming since i got 3-4 weeks of zero nicotine within that stretch, it was enough of a reset combined w the fact i didn’t buy a vape or continue hitting it the next day).

i know i used to be able to manage buying a pack on friday, finishing it saturday and not giving it a second thought, but **vapes are a different animal**. ive been really **intentional to not make excuses for myself if i’m out socially but just slightly buzzed, even in those circumstances i will abstain**. but the couple times in the last few months i’m truly getting rocked with friends, i have vaped nic salts throughout the evening and it **kind of feels like the groove i was in when i would buy a pack on friday and finish it by sunday**. i think **what is stopping me from letting it ramp back up is not wanting to go through the suffering of a proper quit ever again** (meaning going from nonstop daily use to no use and dealing with the cravings, brain fog, irritability, etc). but **i see people in this sub say it is impossible to ever be casual after being full blown nonstop addicted**.

obviously **i know nicotine itself, regardless of delivery mechanism, simply isn’t good for you**. but **i’d be lying if i said i didn’t feel night and day when i was comparing the daily nonstop vaping vibe to just nicotine when drunk**. like **my cardio** is still great, my **anxiety** isn’t as bad as it was using nicotine daily, my **circulation** feels on point – it **genuinely does feel different to me to only hit it drunk**.

**part of me wants to celebrate the 95% reduction and the fact i somehow got back to even better than i ever was**, but i **have this nagging voice from the all-or-nothing mentality on here that somehow the 5% usage i’ve gotten down to is basically equal to just doing it every day**.

to me, i’m confident i could keep it to only drunk a couple times a month and be happy with that. but i still want to spend a few months 100% at baseline.

i look at **my counter** which **has me at day 11** (since **i hit someones posh drunkenly 11 days ago**). but i d**on’t feel like i’m at day 11 and what that felt like when i quit a daily habit**. i **feel like i’m a month or so in** – at that point where you **don’t even think about nicotine every day, and when you do, it is just a passing “oh coffee, vape, wait i don’t do that anymore” type shit** – **no more brain fog, no more irritability, and genuinely much happier with my day-to-day without the habit** – i love doing some deep breathing instead of hitting a vape, i love jumping on the treadmill for a jog, i love feeling my incredible circulation and just everything seems to be running better, idk.

but **i’d be lying if i said i felt the same amount of enthusiasm extends to the idea of never having nicotine when i’m drunk again**. i **know this whole train of thought is some mind trickery** to be like “**don’t make me fully give it up – i’ll make a deal with you, i’ll only ask for it when you’re drunk**” but like honestly… **that is kind of fine with me**?

my **priority right now is abstaining for a few more months** but **if i think about stuff like being at a wedding with my friends hammered or at a rave or some shit**, i’m **not really sweating the idea that i might hit someone’s disposable that night**. at this age, **there aren’t more than a couple occasions a month where i’d be that weak-willed and in the mood**, which **does not seem like enough to be re-addicted**, but obviously i know how easy it is to wake up and say “oh today is a stressful day, i’ll make an exception” and be back at square one.

however, **when i was a teenager, the couple times i tried nicotine sober it made me feel like shit and would give me a panic attack/bad anxiety/all negative effects** (dizziness, heart pounding, total opposite of feeling hitting it buzzed from alcohol). after staying stopped for long enough, i feel like **i’m back to that sort of zone where i hate the idea of how i’d feel hitting it sober but once i have a major buzz from booze, i basically need a hit**. idk if i’m making any sense, **sorry for the tangent** its just **everything i see always talks in all-or-nothing terms** and **i** ***do*** **want to celebrate the small victory of going from 100% all-day-everyday-usage to 5% usage only on super drunk occasions**. idk man whatever lol

  
this thread is for u to tell me maybe i'm being an idiot, i don't know. anyway good luck to everyone and i know this sub is for *quitting* vaping, not for 95% reducing the amount you're vaping. :) cheers, happy vaping everyone (jk jk) <3 ",2,1733858375.0,QuitVaping,5,0.75,False

A heartbeat at my feet.” Rex came into my life on a chilly March afternoon, a week before St Patrick’s Day, a moment of my parents and I “just looking” when my dad said, That’s the one. And he was right. For 13 beautiful years, Rex was the one greeting me when I got home even if i was only gone for 5 minutes, laying in the backyard with me while I was reading, standing next to me every day while i made my coffee, sleeping next to my side every night. He was the one my husband & I were missing while we were away (and our other dog too, of course) and we’ll be missing him every second of every day. 

A big name for a little dog, Rex cheated death so many times, beat cancer, was a master escape artist, loved going on boat rides, relished in a good bonfire, was spunky, loving, literally would dance when he wanted something, and there wasn’t a food in the world he didn’t like- we would even pick cherry tomatoes off the backyard vines and eat them together. What dog does that?! Sometimes my mom & I were sure he was a human in a dog body. We had countless laughs, adventures, and lazy naps in the sun and if he wasn’t on my lap, he was in my arms- I don’t know how I got so lucky. He had my whole heart, and I had his. He was with me through so much: I could only be grateful I could repay him just a fraction and be with him at the end. He taught me so much, in a tiny 16-pound body- most importantly, unconditional love and to always have your favorite blanket nearby. We traveled, we laughed, and I swear to God he cried with me sometimes. What more could you ask for, really? A life well lived. A life well loved. 

But wow, does it hurt. As pet lovers, we always know this day will come but somehow, we pretend it won’t. Now somehow, I will have to go on. He was the bravest little guy- now it’s my turn. 

To know the love of a dog is to catch a glimpse of heaven. Rexy, I know that’s where you are now: running free on a sandy beach with your face lifted in the breeze, napping in the warm sun, and chasing birds— all of your favorite things. You are my favorite thing. Give Nana a kiss for me. I’ll find you again. Thank you for everything. We love you forever, Rexy boy",41,1733858306.0,minpin,9,1.0,False

2. We’re in college and we’re lab partners. I was, let’s just say nowhere near a straight A student. I’m trying to complete our chemistry lab (after school or even in class), I spill the contents of a beaker on me while you’re in the bathroom, which shrinks me. You find me shrunken in my chair

4. We’re spies and we’ve been tasked with infiltrating a rival and bugging their computer, which requires getting into it, physically. I’m a tech guy, and would have to be shrunk not only to infiltrate the building, but bug the computer. You are tasked with shrinking me, getting me in the party we were “guests” at, and near the computer. However, you decide to keep me shrunk after the mission, lying to HQ that I had a misfortune end

5. I’ll play max 2 tiny guys who book a hotel near a beach resort with pools, the beach, clubs, bars, you name it.

Yesterday I was testing a CCS to CHADeMo adapter by evoffer. I went to a site with 5 ccs and 1 chademo stations. 

4 out of 5 ccs1 adapters were blocked by Zolo coffee roaster (who just rents a kitchen in the colocated space) trucks intentionally Zolo coffee.com. Read the whole rant at the bottom of the post.

Evoffer just installed the chargers, Bay Area coasters the owner of the scape paid to put these charging stations to earn money but the tenants are blocking the chargers so no one can charge. 

There is no rules on if anyone can block the charging site or if someone is blocking then how to get them towed or removed … #wild Wild West

Solo Roasters and Zolo Coffee displayed racism and a shocking lack of empathy when their vans blocked EV charging stations, refusing polite requests to move them. Their dismissive and disrespectful behavior reflects poorly on their values and customer service.

If you want to support a business that demonstrates a lack of empathy and unprofessional behavior, Solo Roasters might be for you. Unfortunately, my experience with their team this morning at 9:30 AM on 12/9 was so appalling that I couldn't even bring myself to try their coffee. Here's what happened:

Solo Roasters shares a space with Zolo Coffee in Berkeley, where EV Connect has installed five EV charging stations. However, all the functioning chargers were blocked by Zolo Coffee's delivery vans. After spending two hours trying to use the only unblocked charger (which was not working despite multiple attempts), EV Connect suggested I move to another station. Unfortunately, all the other chargers were blocked by Zolo Coffee's trucks.

When I politely requested that they move one truck so I could charge my vehicle, I was met with shocking responses from a Zolo Coffee team member, including:
 1. ""We get three parking spots.""
 2. ""This is private property.""
 3. ""Give me $10, and I'll move the truck.""
 4. ""You can't do sh*t.""
 5. ""Go charge somewhere else.""
 6. ""None of the chargers work anyway.""
 7. ""I will not move the truck to an adjacent open parking spot.""
 8. Ending with a mocking ""Namaste, asshole.""

This interaction reflects not only a lack of basic decency and professionalism but also a concerning attitude toward customer service and respect for others.

As a result, I can't support a business that displays such callousness and disregard for others. Businesses like this need to understand the importance of empathy and respect in their interactions. I'm willing to remove this review if Zolo Coffee and Solo Roasters demonstrate a commitment to improvement, treat others fairly, and stop engaging in unkind and potentially discriminatory behavior.

# Training

Up until yesterday, I had run three marathons and had been 'cursed' with running a 2:58:46 in NYC on my very first marathon in 2021. My goal was to qualify for Boston, but I let the application window close without realizing that my time would not be valid for the next edition of the race.  No biggie, right? I'll just run a flatter course with similar training and qualify again! Dead wrong, rookie.

I had an inflated sense of my running abilities, and I've had to learn the hard way that I'm not special. I ran Chicago in 2022 and will briefly relitigate all that happened there: I blew it. GI issues made me take two bathroom breaks at mile 8 and 18. After each one I kept trying to fight back to where I had left the course, which emptied my tank too early and led me to bonk and finish in 3:00:28. A hard lesson to learn.

I've done a lot of running and a lot of studying the sport since then. This set me off on a journey to qualify myself for Boston - again - the right way. Easier said than done.

I committed myself to being a smarter and more disciplined runner. For my first 3 marathons, I had peaked at about 40 miles per week. Sure, these included quality sessions, but I knew that I could give more to meet my goals. I decided to scrupulously follow the Pfitzinger 18/55 plan starting in August. I additionally committed myself to building a 40 miles per week pace to start the plan.

I was able to absorb the volume very well. In 2024, I PR'd in the mile, 5k, 10k, and half, so I was feeling like I was on a roll. When I ran a 1:22 half in Brooklyn, I figured that a 2:50 full may just be in reach. I decided that this would be my 'secret' goal, with a publicly stated goal of 2:52, which felt like I would definitely achieve. My paces for the Pfitz plan were set based on a 2:50 goal time, and I was able to run the 'benchmark workouts' in those paces (eg: 18 miles with 14 @ MP). I also ran a hilly 22-miler (through Central Park and over two bridges) in 2:47:5X, which felt like a good omen for the race to come.

Those runs all went well, and although they were big efforts, they didn't feel overwhelming. However, I also think that I deluded myself on some occasions. The 18-miler specifically was performed in a strong headwind, and I ran a steady progression. Surely, this means that I'm free and clear, right? Nope! You are never free and clear in a marathon.

# Pre-race

I chose CIM for it's reputation as a fast race, and also as an opportunity to visit some family out in the Bay Area. I had never run a race with so much support. Having my girlfriend and several family members around really helped to ground me in my planning and preparations. I reviewed the course preview fanatically, and reviewed several race recaps to help prepare for the course.

I got up at 3:30 AM, ate a bowl of oatmeal, had a cup of coffee, and made my way to the bus. I was fortunate to board one of the nicer buses (with an onboard toilet) and spent most of the journey to the start village snoozing. The buses reached the start at 5:30, and decided to stay on the bus until 6:00.

The first thing I did when I got off was to head to the porta potties, which were fine around 6. I was really focused on fully clearing my system to avoid a repeat of my 2022 Chicago meltdown. After a first movement, I went for a 10 minute warmup jog, which I got back from at 6:25.

Things went a bit screwy here. I immediately got back in line for the porta potties, and picked the worst possible line. It was going *very* sluggishly. At that point, I decided to work on my mental calmness. I decided that I would not panic until 6:50. I had heard lots of feedback that the CIM corrals were chill, and so I would trust that I could get in with only minutes to spare at the start.

I still had throwaway shoes and sweatpants on, which I resorted to changing out of while waiting for the toilets to free up. The door to my porta-potty opened at 6:51. I did the deed as quick as I could, and bolted out of there, 'race ready' at 6:55.

The race officials had closed the 2:55 corral at that point, so I hopped in at 3 and elbowed my way as close as possible to the 2:55 bunny. To the few hundred of people that I passed by at that point, I sincerely want to apologize. With this rush to the start, I left myself no time for any dynamic stretching or warmups. This was a critical mistake on my part.

My other big mess-up here was that I was wearing a throwaway jacket from goodwill at the start, and I had put some gloves in the pockets. In my rush to get myself to the line, I tossed the jacket with the gloves inside. This led to some serious cold issues later in the race.

# Race

Part of my journey to racing smarter included a focus on pacing. I had made some sloppy mistakes at Chicago, and was determined to not repeat those this time. My pace strategy was to go out with a conservative start, aiming to reach 13.1 in 1:27:00 (or slightly faster) and  knocking out a 1:23:00 on the easier bottom half. Throughout the race though, I spent a lot of mental effort focusing on my current pace, and adjusting conservatively to make sure I wouldn't blow up later in the race.

After the first few miles, I was feeling... Just OK. My heart rate was way higher than what my training had indicated, sitting at mid-150s. Not sure if this was due to stress or the scramble at the start. I kept repeating calming/soothing mantras and focusing on my breathing. I was fortunate to see some friendly faces in the crowd at mile 5, which buoyed my spirits. For better or for worse, my 2:48 goal went out the window very quickly. I just felt like it wasn't going to happen, which in retrospect was the wise thing to do.

I had started the race feeling very good temperature-wise, but I got the impression that the day was getting cooler as it ticked on, not warmer. My hands and fingers got *extremely* cold. Every time I picked up a gel or electrolytes, they felt warm in my hand. Man, I really wish I had gloves. I felt like my lack of discipline at the start was really affecting my race. There was a really thick fog on the course, which I later found out was also smog (the forecast called it 'dangerous for vulnerable populations').

I crossed the half mark in around 1:26, which I was really glad about. I didn't believe in 2:48 anymore, but I was thinking that I may just sneak in under 2:50. At that point, all of my focus was on locking into a 6:30 pace for the bottom half, which my training fully supported. I kept thinking back to all of my long runs with MP work that I had done without tapering, in a headwind, in hills, and thought that it was in the bag (it was not).

I finally caught up to the 2:55 pace group around mile 15, and committed to sticking with them for 3 or so miles to help lock into a pace. This was really fortunate, and helped keep me focused and motivated for a few miles. Doubts started to creep in after one or two miles though, when a lot of the folks around me were speculating that the pacers may not be on pace. I decided to carefully, very slowly peel off from this group and run my own race. I knew I was nowhere near the point where I should kick hard, but I stopped feeling the groove of the 2:55 group.

As I was forging my own path around mile 18, things got a bit dark for me. Not only were my hamstrings feeling very iffy, I was afraid that I'd need to stop for a bathroom break. This was really hard on morale. I was stymied by this in 2022, and did everything I could in the intervening years (nutrition, race prep, training) to not have this problem again. If I had stopped for a bathroom break, this would have been a seriously blow to my views on running in general. I decided to grin and bear it and push through as best I could.

Passing the bridge, a very nice runner came up alongside me (#9887 - thank you!) and gave some solid words of encouragement. We figured out that we had similar goals, and I bucked up and decided to try and chase him to the finish. This seriously uplifted me and also served as a reminder of how close to the finish I was. After turning onto L Street, I gave it my all and was able to speed up to faster than I thought. Two quick turns and I kicked hard to the finish, hot on the heels of my new friend.

Throughout the race I drank 1000 mL of Maurten 320 (100 Caf) and 5 gels (4 honey stinger + 1 precision with Caf). I also grabbed electrolytes at several stations, but didn't really count them or track which miles they were at. I think that was plenty of fuel, but I would love to hear this sub's feedback on that.

I crossed the line in 2:52:53. A bit above my original goal, but still a BQ with hopefully enough of a buffer to run in 2026. I came in 734th Overall / 646th M / 158 M30-34.

# Post-race

I'm extremely proud of a six-minute PR, and even more proud of the road I've taken from being a lucky first-time marathoner to a much smarter and humbler athlete. I really feel like this cycle showed me the value of patience and discipline.

I still have a ways to go, but this race really proved to me that carefully tightening all the screws one by one will lead to satisfying results. The biggest joy of this event was being surrounded by friends, family, and my girlfriend, who have all lent so much support throughout the process.

I still think there's some room for me to grow (I'm 32, and this was my 4th marathon) but for now, I'm celebrating.

I feel there 192948573839 different ways that one can try to improve a cup with every brew. 
So far i have settled on Lances two cup pour as a basis for brews but there are so many different variables that it's hard for me to know what adjustments I should make next. Of course people will say to dial in to taste but it's not always obvious in which direction I should go if I want to highlight the fruitiness of a coffee for example, or if I want to reduce astringency.
The variables that I consider with every brew are as follows:

Grind size
Bloom duration 
Agitation from pouring (turbulent or laminar)
Swirling 
Water temp
Water chemistry (recently acquired lotus water)
Brew ratio

I really get lost sometimes on where I should focus my attention. So many people have suggested improving water, hence purchasing the lotus water, but how am I supposed to know if the flavour profile of the cup is due to the water chemistry that I have chosen, or if it's to do with any or a combination of the variables? The water seems like just another variable to dial in with a new bag of beans. Help me out here guys!

I really don't know what features I'm supposed to do myself or is automated. 

I'm looking for a vaccum and mop combo that can self dump and self clean the mop pads. I don't think it has to mop the floor mats as I can just throw them in the washer. The front door mat, I'm not sure what happens with that, but it might some wet dirt from outside time to time? I don't wear shoes in the house. I know some of them can clean corners better, but I don't really get it or if that price point is worth it.

Can anyone give me some recommendations? I don't mind the price necessarily, but I would prefer the price to match the increased value.

I was initially so glad to have upgraded but after a couple shots, any subsequent dose I grind fully clogs the chute. I don’t RDT or anything like that, and it clogs the chute tightly to the point where I need to manually remove the coffee grounds with a chopstick. Given the reviews I read I can’t imaging this is normal for the grinder. Prior to returning the grinder is there anything I should consider?

I have fully cleared the chute, tried bellowing before and after and nothing has helped. Thanks!

1hb9gg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1hb9gg7/end_of_year_gifts_another_one/,End of year gifts (another one),"I know there have been several EOY gift discussions on here, and I’ve found them to be helpful, but am looking for some additional advice :)

Between my two kids, we have 14 teachers or caregivers:

-Two “lead” teachers (also the highest paid, and one is the daycare owner), 
-Two directors (also highest paid), 
-Six additional caregivers (also very involved in our children’s care), 
-Three school therapists my child sees 1-2 times a week (OT, PT and speech), 
-One dance teacher both my kids see. 

Last year, I budgeted about $25 for each and got them a tote bag with their initial, a small initialed accessories bag, a nice pen, post-it notes with funny messages, an Eric Carle book called “thank you teacher” (can’t remember the exact title!) and Ghirardelli chocolate. (For the therapists and dance teacher, I got a $15 gift card and mug to our local coffee shop, instead.)

That said, I thought last year I was doing well with $350 extra towards caregivers (plus the bonus to our cleaning lady and all the donations to local charities around this time of year - local library, church, food pantry, etc.). All in all, for gifts outside of close friends or family, we spent around $750.

That said, Reddit has opened my eyes, and I no longer feel like my $25 budget per caregiver is adequate…in fact, I kind of feel cheap!!! But at the same time, I’m not sure I can double my budget to $50 per caregiver/teacher…that would put us at $700 just for caregivers/teachers alone! I also feel like giving straight cash is a little anticlimactic if it’s say, only $30. So what’s a nice gift I can give to teachers/caregivers that keeps us in the $30ish price range? I already ordered everyone personalized stationary (5 cards/envelopes) before I had this awakening, but they were only $6/set, so I still have most of my budget available.

Thanks in advance for your ideas!

Fun facts up front:

* Used Ubigi eSIM with no issues
* Used USA Visa credit cards and VISA debit cards at ATMs everywhere with only one issue out of dozens of purchases
* Apps needed: Naver Map, Kakao T, T-locker luggage storage, Klook, Asiana

# Days 1-5: Seoul

We arrived arrived to ICN from the USA around 06:30 local time. Collected bags and got T-money cards for 4000krw each from the CU convenience store in Terminal 1 at ICN. We then got a Kakao T taxi called a “Venti” (which is a 6-seater van with plenty of room for 4 people and luggage, thankyou Reddit) and got to our Airbnb apartment in Myeongdong (on the lower slopes of Mt Namsan, essentially) to wash up and nap for a couple hours.

Hungry, we walked down to the main part of Myeongdong and hopped in a short-ish line, about 20 minutes, at Myeongdong Kyoja. This was 100% worth the short wait as the food is incredible and the service is smooth and efficient. My kids didn’t find it spicy or weird and OH MY GOD the kimchi here is so incredibly delicious and garlicky.

We then wandered around central Myeongdong for some window shopping and fun. Grabbed coffee at UPND cafe (aka “Eopendeu”) which served a very good “third-wave” style Chemex pourover coffee and desserts. Then we ran into the dancing cat mascot for Cat Cafe Sarangchae. Sarangchae was a very good and reasonably priced cat cafe, with hot espresso drinks, with nice decor and good spacing of clients, though the cats were fairly chill and not terribly playful or cuddly. I headed over to Davich Optical to see about getting prescription sunglasses - they said my high prescription would take 4-5 days - while the rest of the family shopped and got caricatures, which is very much a thing in the touristy parts of Seoul and Korea generally it seems. We grabbed dinner at Sushiro near the Myeongdong Cathedral, which leaves something to be desired for quantity/quality but kaitensushi is my kids’ absolute favorite so all were reasonably happy. We strolled a bit more and enjoyed the very Christmas-y vibe - there is a big tree right in front of the Myeongdong Theater and lots of gift-y / Christmas-y ads on the giant screen at the Shinsegae department store. We saw quite a bit of the anti-president protests going on along the main thoroughfare Namdaemun-ro before heading back for the evening.

**Day 2** \- the weather forecast looked decent today so we wanted to spend it actively without overexerting ourself re: jetlag. But we very much overexerted ourselves anyway! We took the metro over to DDP for an art installation called Immersive-K which is one of those digital art shows, with the nice and artistic wrinkle of it being inspired by traditional Korean art and visual motifs. The show runs until April 2025, and being there right when it opened, we were the only ones inside! Highly recommend. My kids also got to play the outdoor piano in DDP which they loved.

Next we checked out the Sparex jjimjilbang across from DDP in the “Good Morning City” building, level B3. This worked out really well for our family and we were not the only (Western) tourists there. While the sauna/coed section was not my favorite – felt like I was constantly third-wheeling couple sitting together on their phones in the saunas (!) - the sex-separate baths area was really great and refreshing and overall well worth the 12000krw. My wife got a body scrub and we all had lunch here, which was one of the more legit Korean meals we had in Seoul, served by a couple older ladies, with the soft tofu stew being spicy as hell and lots of panchan.

We then grabbed a taxi (our first of many) over to the Nanta show in Myeongdong. Interesting that this was basically the most expensive attraction we did the whole trip - a ticket is about 50,000krw while that is also what admission to Lotte World Adventure costs. The show itself was great but probably best for kids age 4-12, with lots of goofy physical humor and nonverbal comedy to go with dancing and music. Older kids (or cynical adults) will probably find it a little “broad” or childish. My kids absolutely loved it.

The weather was cooperative (50s, clear) so we walked up Namsan Mountain. The walk from central Myeongdong (say, the station, or Shinsegae dept store) is only about 45 minutes. It was crisp and clear at the top for sunset and photos and we got the cable car back down. We finished off the night with some street food in the central part of Myeongdong, with my kids and I agreeing that (overpriced, I’m sure) gimbap is amazing. The mandu stands there I found pretty tasty and there were plenty of seafood options for my wife.

**Day 3** \- My wife planned to have some “me time” in the morning in Gangnam and my kids love books and reading, so the Coex Mall / Starfield Library was a natural destination. It was pleasantly uncrowded at \~11am and has several nice coffee and chocolate shops there. It’s just kind of wild that the centerpoint of a giant mall in a giant city is a literal library; this is unfathomable in the USA (not that we really have malls anymore anyway).

The Coex mall has a bunch of nice shopping stores, mostly brands etc, as well as a Gundam store (yasss) and at least one arcade (Fun City) on the basement level. Fun City had a variety of games that were mostly 1,000krw a play including dancing and shooting games and no hassle with using a payment card. There are also 4 coin noraebang stalls in this arcade so if you are in this area of Gangnam and want to do low-hassle, no-alcohol, kid-friendly noraebang, that’s a good option. We grabbed lunch at a Jeonju Bibimbap in the restaurant “street” on B1F where there were a number of tourist- and kid-friendly restaurants.

Wanting to branch out a bit from Myeongdong, we took the Metro over to Insadong primarily to check out the Dynamic Maze and Jogyesa. My kids loved the Dynamic Maze and actually begged to go back in the days that followed - interestingly, one of the Klook Seoul passes allows unlimited return visits, but we didn’t have it - but it’s not very unique or special, just that it’s the kind of thing that kids love in general. Jogyesa was very beautiful after dark and we strolled along the Insadong “culture street” with the craft shops.

We met back up with my wife in Myeongdong and then I got my “me time” of chimaek. I went to the BHC in Myeongdong, which is in a cluster of restaurants spilling out onto the sidewalk which seemed to me one of the only outdoor dining options around and has kind of a beer garden feel. I did my best to polish off a platter of BHC chicken (half original, half sauced) with a liter+ of beer and had a great time people watching. BHC was full of larger groups but also kids and families with small children so at least this particular location in central Myeongdong is family friendly, to be expected. Also, the serving of chicken is obviously too much for one person, more meant for 2-4 people at least, but that’s obvious based on the fact it’s like 12 pieces of chicken. All joined up, we went to Skycat Cafe and while it was enjoyable it was a smaller operation with no hot drinks (vs Sarangchae) so I could not highly recommend it.

**Day 4** \- Today was Lotte World / Jamsil day, and a rainy and cold day in the 40’s. We got a taxi from Myeongdong to a building right next to Lotte World Adventure, to get gyobok (the school uniforms) to go into LWA. We somehow ended up in a different building than the one I was intending (trying to find Ehwa) but ran into a shop with two friendly older guys simply called “Seoul School Uniform” in B1-17 of the building 2 buildings west of Lotte World that was zero wait, zero hassle. At 66,000krw for the 4 of us that felt like a good price and we were on our way. (For what it’s worth, the gyobok place right across from the B1F main entrance of LWA was absolutely crushed at 10-11am). 

LWA was a mixed experience for sure. As many have said, it was very crowded, even though we got there around 11am on a weekday, and it got crazy crowded in the afternoon, presumably as teens showed up after school. The reservation system for certain rides was confusing, i.e., there was literally no way it could or would be explained to us. We chose not to get the Magic Pass or whatever it’s called based on the outdoor rides being closed and our kids not being tall enough for one of the roller coasters. We did get our tickets on Klook with the combo ticket for Seoul Sky - this was an easy win.

Our first ride was Drunken Baskets. I can’t tell you how much of a mistake this was. I was nauseous for literally hours after this thing and it ruined half my day. I’m not prone to motion sickness but holy hell. Next we did the haunted house which a) costs extra money and b) isn’t good. I basically had to ditch my family to get some sugar and hydration in me to deal with nausea. Fly Venture was fun but again did not help the situation, and I ditched my family again to go to Mr. Pork for a Namsan tonkatsu, which was delicious. They did the hot air balloon and a hilarious Christmas parade took place (imagine Korean Santa booming, “HAPPY CHRISTMAS!”). Ultimately my kids did some bumper cars, the merry-go-round, and got turned away at (I believe) Kidstoria for being too tall. We got some souvenirs and got outta there. So yes, very much the mixed experience, made worse by crowds, that I was told would happen.

We got ourselves over to Seoul Sky next, which was really fantastic. There was no line to get in and soon we were up on the 120th floor for the views, cafe, and the open-to-all piano. Cool experience, my kids loved the glass floor looking down 1000+ feet.

Our family split up at this point, because I had secured a ticket to a performance at the music hall (Namsan Gugakdang) at Namsangol Hanok Village to see a type of music I wasn’t familiar with, a kut / sanjo / sinawi performance billed as an “exorcism” and played by a \~8 person ensemble. It was a very cool experience and I highly recommend checking out the website for NHV ahead of time for events like this. The pieces were introduced in Korean but I had done a little research on kut and some of the instruments ahead of time and used Google Translate on the program provided so I had some general idea of what was going on. I do believe I was the only tourist at this thing, and the audience response was rapturous.

(Tangent - I couldn’t buy a ticket on Naver because foreigner, so days before the show I went to the actual music hall to do so. The staff there couldn’t sell me a ticket either because it was some kind of one-off, third-party-hosted event. They said to call, and I couldn’t because no local phone number. They called for me, and no response. So, and all this being done via Google Translate, the staffer asked for my email and they would try to connect me to the booking office. An hour later, I got an email “Hello sir we have heard you would like a ticket to the Yoon Ho-Se performance, we will reserve one for you, thank you.” Amazingly kind and friendly!!!)

All the while my family, who had queued up in a VERY long line at the Gatten Sushi place in the Lotte Mall in Jamsil (the whole place was slammed at dinnertime) ultimately got bibimbap while I got samgyetang, which I did not really care for, but hot soup while a cold rain fell outside was well worth it.

# Days 5-8 - Seoul to Golgulsa and Gyeongju and back

The cold rain overnight turned into snow, and Seoul ended up getting a November-record \~6” of snow. This rendered Seoul quite beautiful, and logistically mostly figured for us as we needed to get to Seoul Station for a KTX train to Gyeongju en route to Golgulsa in the late morning. The taxi situation was nonexistent and we ended up taking the Metro which was not too crowded at 10am (plus it’s only 2 stops and no transfer from Myeongdong so…duh).

As we were returning to Seoul Station in 72h, we stashed some of our luggage using “T-locker” which is the default locker provider in the stations there. The other luggage services (Bounce, Radical, Storr, etc) seemed inconvenient and the same price so other than needing an app for T-locker it was quite easy. (For what it’s worth, it’s 24,000krw a day for a large luggage locker which is one of the few “expensive” things in Seoul!). Grabbed some coffee and gimbap before the train. I checked with the station agent that the QR code on my phone was sufficient for our tickets, but in the roundtrip journey from Seoul to Gyeongju no one checked our tickets once. So that is very cool.

Arriving to Singyeongju station, we grabbed udon soup lunch at one of the small restaurants there and took at 45-minute, 52,000krw taxi ride to Golgulsa.

Our 2-night Temple Stay experience at Golgulsa Buddhist Temple was wonderful and a highlight of our trip. I’ll link to my TripAdvisor review [here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297888-d3629968-Reviews-Golgulsa_Temple-Gyeongju_Gyeongsangbuk_do.html) and sum up here. This was a great experience for solo or group or family travelers. It’s a tourist-facing but not “dumbed down” experience in my opinion and the agenda/itinerary gives you free time and some flexibility with what you would like to do or achieve. I.e., it was not “boot camp” in the sense of being forced to do anything, but also some of the things offered or expected of us were literally quite difficult like the 108 prostrations. The food was delicious and obviously vegetarian. I would definitely say the overnight stay is well worth it, and that we did get a lot out of the second day+night as well as the sessions, even if “every day is the same,” go differently depending on who and how family people are there and what the group would like to do or achieve. The principles of temple life (quiet, timeliness, calmness, eating everything on your plate and cleaning up) were shared and that was a very cool and very valuable experience for my kids. We spent a fair amount of time with Master Tao, an enigmatic man who was our main point of contact and the best English speaker around. We did the tea session, multiple sunmudo sessions, and the orientation sessions with him. He is an interesting and thoughtful and also funny person and someone I will not forget soon. One tip - bring cash to pay for your temple stay! My main credit card did not work here even though it worked everywhere else in Korea, luckily my 2nd one worked.

On our third day at Golgulsa, we packed up after lunch and got a 30-minute, 30,000krw taxi to Gyeongju. The Hotel Palace (bookable on Chase Points!) was a nice place with good breakfast and laundry and a comfortable 2-queen-bed room, very close to the central market and just a few blocks from Geumgwanchong. They did not let us check in early but we left our luggage with them and went out to explore.

Gyeongju is a lovely city. It is small and feels manageable, and the city and region/country have clearly been pumping money into tourism development here as you can see at the Geumgwanchong “museum” (which is excellent!) and Silla Dynasty Tombs Information Center.

Lonely Planet says the Gyeongju National Museum is “possibly the best in the country” and I think that has to be right. It’s free, it’s multilingual, and the content is very interesting. The plaza between the main exhibition hall and cafe building is lovely and the Ediya cafe has a great view overlooking the valley. Plus, there is a children’s museum targeted for age 3-9 I believe that has great activities and play spaces and is also free.

We got over to Donggung Palace aka Wolji Pond aka Anapji just at dusk - they actually post what time the lights come on - and although this is not an excellent historically-presented site, the beauty of the pond and buildings and lights can’t be understated. It’s lovely, and open until 10pm!

Having eaten vegetarian Buddhist food for 3 days, we wanted some comfort food, and were directed by Reddit to check out a Neapolitan pizza place “DOMI” which, holy hell, is legit Neapolitan pizza presumably 0-0 flour and a proper hot oven. Don’t miss this one. We then walked around some of the tombs areas which are stunning all lit up and down to the busy shopping and eating street Hwangnidan-gil. A lot of the development in this area looks new and I hope Gyeongju is just at the beginning of a glow-up.

The next morning, we had our hotel’s breakfast - I finally tried Busan style fish cake on a stick, not my thing at all - and walked around the tomb areas by daylight. As said above, the Geumgwanchong museum was awesome, though Cheonmachong (the only mound you can go in) is totally unnecessary after going to the National Museum. We grabbed lunch at Daewha Mandu which was great, walked past the observatory and Woljeonggyo bridge, and just thoroughly enjoyed the beauty and culture of Gyeongju. 

We got a taxi to the KTX back to Seoul, where, Saturday protests and drizzly rain snarled traffic, and it took us about an hour to go 3km in a taxi from Seoul Station to Anguk area! We checked into our hanok just outside of Bukchon Hanok Village and strolled down to Insadong. The kaitensushi at Ian Sushi in the Anyoung Insadong mall was good-not-great, and we window shopped and called it a night.

# Days 9-10 - Seoul and home

We were staying in Insadong / Anguk area but I had to pick up my glasses from Davich Optical down in Myeongdong so I jogged across town for a little exercise + errand. Ironically enough our day brought us back to Myeongdong so it was an effort for nothing but maybe highlights how central Myeongdong is.

We got coffee at Fritz Coffee Wonseo, in the Arario Museum front courtyard, which has a lovely seating area in (I think) an old hanok but the coffee was just-ok. We took the metro over to Gyeongbokgung for the day’s highlight, renting hanbok and strolling the palace for photos. The dressup experience was a huge amount of fun for my kids and in the palace we had so many friendly folks approaching us to offer to take photos of us as a family or in some cases, to get pictures WITH us! We rented from “Yes Hanbok” which was something like 30,000krw each so the whole “renting a hanbok is 5,000 won” angle wasn’t quite right.

We were hungry and still needed to do KBBQ in Seoul so we took a taxi down to Myeongdong to go to Daol BBQ specifically. This is a very touristy spot and not the best choice, but the quality of the meat seemed very high, and they did have seafood pancake for my wife although it was just meh. KBBQ in general is so much more expensive than most other foods in Korea, understandably, with the meal for 4 being about 150,000krw.

We did some souvenir shopping, stopping into one of the many Olive Youngs in the area and finding multiple Kpop souvenir stands in the Myeongdong Underground Shopping Center. We made our way back to Insadong for some more ceramic and craft shopping and there was street food stalls with basic food out as well as the many cafes along “Insadong Culture Street” and the malls nearby. Ultimately we got a very excellent dinner at Orena Ramen which was legit Tokyo Station Ramen Street quality and only a short wait, would highly recommend.

Our last day in Seoul we had a few hours to kill before an afternoon flight home and our Airbnb host was very kind to allow us to check out at 1pm. We got coffee and pastries at Hollow Cafe which is fun (and huge!) and strolled the Bukchon Hanok Village, which is crammed with folks angling for photos as well as some sort of film or TV or commercial shoot going on. We grabbed ice cream at Beurre Beurre, hopped in a Venti Kakao taxi back to ICN, and used Priority Pass access to the Asiana lounge to chill before the long flight home.

Lessons learned:

* English was very widely spoken here and only a couple times did we use Google Translate
* Credit cards were used almost everywhere, except some street stalls so it's useful to have 20-50k krw on you
* Taxis in central Seoul were cheap and easy way to get around, outside of rush hours and protests
* Only headache was dealing with the Naver / Google Map / Kakao issue of routefinding and choosing a taxi destination. Naver gives you everything in English, which Kakao T doesn't want, and their search functions are poor.
* People were generally friendly and welcoming to tourists and kids
* Seoul easily held our attention with attractions and activities for 6-7 days
* Buddhist Temple Stay was a trip (and lifetime) highlight experience, highly recommend",5,1733857529.0,koreatravel,1,1.0,False

Life is a beautiful, chaotic symphony, and I’m just a guy with a ticket for two. Somewhere between coffee-fueled mornings and stargazing nights, I’ve realized something’s missing—you.

I’m a 32-year-old dreamer, lover of the little things, and hopeless romantic who believes that laughter is the best glue for two souls. Whether it’s slow dancing in the kitchen, getting lost in deep conversations, or sharing the last slice of pizza (yes, really), I’m all in.

What am I looking for? Someone who makes my heart skip a beat with just a smile. Someone who finds beauty in a rainy day, can laugh at bad jokes, and isn’t afraid to be unapologetically themselves.

I don’t care where you’re from—our hearts can bridge any distance. So, if you’re ready to turn a simple “hello” into something extraordinary, send me a message. Let’s make this cheesy fairytale a reality.

After all, isn’t the world a little brighter when you’ve got someone to share it with?

Yours romantically,
A guy hoping to find his perfect someone.

1hb9bx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hb9bx0/aitah_for_holding_my_friends_phone_hostage_and/,AITAH for holding my friend's phone hostage and cutting off my friend group ,"This story happened about two years ago, but I still think about it from time to time. Recently, I was discussing something with my mom, and she brought it up as an example of ""why my mindset is wrong."" It's a long story, so I’m posting this from a throwaway account and using fake names since a lot of my friends use Reddit.

My university offers a ""get ready for uni"" program to help students familiarize themselves with their courses before starting. I’m usually a shy person, but I told one of my friends that I wanted to have a girlfriend when I started university. He jokingly suggested that I create a group chat for freshmen to get all the girls' numbers—yes, I know this sounds weird. I decided to do it anyway. After the first lecture, I went to the front of the class, wrote my phone number on the board, and said I was creating a group chat.

A guy, let's call him Jack, started making fun of me and calling me names, but I didn’t pay much attention because of all the talking around me. Anyway, I made the group, and since the university’s IT department hadn’t set up a student email system yet, the chat became the primary way the university communicated with students. As a result, I was unofficially made the ""leader/coordinator.""

As the coordinator, I organized a lot of fun activities to help the freshmen bond, like spin-the-bottle games, a game called Werewolf (similar to Among Us but played on one phone), and a ""hot chair"" game where we’d ask someone hard or personal questions. I also collected lecture notes from teachers and shared them with the students. Because of this group, many people became good friends, and some even started relationships.

When the first year of college began, I found myself in a close friend group with Jack, David, Richard, William, Kevin, and Mark. We became really good friends.

In the second year, David and I failed the final exam and had to repeat the year. This was partly due to a relationship with a girl I had a crush on that Richard accidentally sabotaged. Meanwhile, the rest of the group moved on to the next year.

That year, I got my driver’s license, and my dad bought a car that he allowed me to use to commute to college. I lived about 10 km away from the university, and since my dad traveled a lot for work, the car became my responsibility. Because of this, I ended up being the designated driver for the group, driving them to restaurants, parties, and even teaching some of them how to drive. David lived along my route to the university, so I often picked him up as well. We had the same schedule and shared a lot in common, so I didn’t mind.

Jack, however, found out about this and started showing up at my house early in the morning to ride with us to the university. His schedule was different from mine, but instead of switching buses three times to get to campus, he would take one bus to my house and join the carpool. This was sometimes annoying, but he helped us with study notes and made the rides fun, so I let it slide.

In the next year, both David and I failed the finals again and had to repeat the year once more. It turned out my marks had been calculated incorrectly, but my dad was so angry about me repeating a year twice that he refused to pay the regrading fees. Jack also failed but was already a year ahead of us.

By the third year, I was determined to do well, and when the results came out, I was shocked to see that I had failed again. I told my mom, and without informing my dad, she paid the regrading fees and spoke to the Head of the Examination Committee. It turned out that three of my tests had been graded incorrectly, and I had actually passed.

By this time, Richard and William had their own cars, so I wasn’t the only one driving anymore. I also started spending more time with a different friend group from my neighborhood. I went out less often with the university group.

One day after some late lectures, William, Richard, Kevin, and Mark invited me to a fancy new restaurant. I declined, saying I was broke and had things to do at home. They offered to cover for me, even saying I could eat for free, but I still declined, telling them I needed to take my mom to one of her friends. They asked if they could borrow my ATM card instead, as the restaurant only accepted cash or cards, not banking apps.

At first, I refused because I needed my card that day—my dad was transferring a significant amount of money (over $10,000) for house projects. Jack then offered to go with them specifically to return my card the next day. Trusting him, I gave him the card and dropped David off on the way home.

The next day, Jack came to my house as usual, and we picked up David on the way to university. I waited for Jack to return the ATM card without me asking, thinking it would seem more responsible that way. However, when we got to the university, I asked him for it, and he teased me, saying, ""What card? What are you talking about?""

After some back-and-forth with him and David joking around, Jack finally admitted he had the card but said he would give it back after our lectures. At the end of the day, I asked him again, but he claimed he didn’t have it on him. At this point, I started to worry. I asked, “Do you have it or not?” and he said he’d give it back on our way home.

On the way home, Jack was in the front seat. I grabbed his phone and said, “Give me my card, and I’ll give you your phone.” It was still lighthearted at this point, as they often joked about things like this. I thought it was just another prank to get on my nerves.

We dropped David off at his house, and when we got to the bus stop where Jack usually got off, two other friends who took the bus with him were also there. I still refused to return Jack’s phone, so he couldn’t just leave. I said, “Give me the card, and I’ll give you your phone.” Jack told the other two friends to leave without him because “this was going to take a while.” This confused me and made me more anxious.

Jack then made a serious face and claimed he didn’t have my card. I wasn’t sure if he was still joking, so I asked him to swear to God he was telling the truth. He refused, saying I wasn’t in a position to make him swear. Instead, he said he could prove the card wasn’t with him, but with Richard or William, if I gave him his phone to make the call.

Still suspicious, I asked for his watch as collateral before I handed him his phone. He reluctantly agreed. Jack called William, who answered while laughing and said, “Oh, we have your card. We even spent $600 more than the first $300 we transferred to your account.”

I was shocked. I realized my dad’s large transfer had gone through, and my friends had been spending the money. I gave Jack his watch back but was still in disbelief. I told him, “I don’t believe you. You refused to swear, and now I want proof. Tell them to send me a picture of the card, and I’ll give you your phone.”

Jack called them again and asked for a picture. They sent a blurry video of them flipping me off with a card that wasn’t in focus. Before I could see it clearly, Jack became angry, accusing me of not trusting him and treating him like a stranger. He said I wasn’t a real friend and didn’t appreciate everything he had done for me.

Suddenly, Jack jumped out of the car, opened my door, and started kicking me while I was trying to unbuckle my seatbelt. He jumped inside the car and snatched his phone back. I was scared he was trying to take my car keys. He kept kicking me while I tried to push him away and get out of the car.

By this point, people at the bus stop noticed the commotion and stepped in to separate us. Two men pinned him down, while others held me back. After calming us down, they told me to get in my car and drive away. I got in and started moving, but as soon as they let Jack go, he ran after the car and kicked the back of it.

At that moment, I snapped. I stopped the car, got out, and started fighting him again. Jack tried to kick me, but I dodged it, moved to the side, and punched him in the face. The men from the bus stop came back and broke up the fight again. Jack yelled at me, “If you’re a man, come to the next bus stop. I’ll kill you there.”

I drove to the next bus stop and texted the group chat, saying I was done being friends with Jack and that the teasing and pranks needed to stop. Before I could leave the chat, Jack sent a picture of my front door, saying he was waiting for me and calling me a coward for not fighting him. Furious, I rushed home.

When I got there, Jack saw my car, walked up to the door, and started banging on it, yelling at my parents, “Look what your kid did to me!” My mom opened the door, shocked to see Jack. She invited him in and called me to come inside.

She started trying to calm us down and asked what was going on. She asked Jack to speak first. He explained the story from his perspective, He went on about how we had been friends for a long time, how he had helped me with lectures and always had my back, and how I betrayed his friendship over something as ""small"" as the card. He also complained about how I had no right to take his phone and treat him like a child. He concluded by saying he couldn't believe he ever considered me a friend.

I sat there and let him finish. My parents know me well—they know that I’m not the type to bully people and that I’m a peaceful person who relies on logic instead of conflict. I told my mom the story about the ATM card, explaining what happened the day before and how he went to the restaurant solely to retrieve the card. I also described how Jack played a game of ""I have it—no, I don’t.""

My mom said this wasn’t a major issue on either side. She told us it was just an angry moment and urged us to think about our friendship and everything we’d been through. She encouraged us to forgive each other. At that moment, my dad walked in and asked what was going on. My mom explained the situation to him.

My dad asked Jack what had happened to the ATM card. Jack claimed he didn’t have it but said he was sure it was in good hands. My dad explained that an ATM card is a serious responsibility, not something to be toyed with. He told Jack to do whatever he could to get the card back and reminded him that by going to the restaurant yesterday, he had accepted responsibility for it. Jack promised he would get it back to me the next morning. My dad told us to handle this like adults, emphasizing that this wasn’t worth fighting over. He also trusted that we’d fix things, remain friends, and eventually laugh about it all.

At that moment, David arrived at my house, having seen the texts in our group chat and rushed over. My parents explained the situation to him and trusted him to help resolve it. I told David about the significant amount of money (over 10k) on the card and how I planned to send it to another friend I trusted more than our university friend group. I did exactly that.

The next day, I picked up David and went to the university. I told him I’d be cutting ties with the group chat until they apologized. I also said Jack needed to apologize for dragging my parents into this mess and making me look bad in front of them. Additionally, I felt he owed my parents an apology if he wanted to continue our friendship. I made it clear that I didn’t want to talk to them for now and just wanted the ATM card back.

After our lectures ended, David and I were walking toward my car when he suggested we stop by a coffee shop near the parking lot. Reluctantly, I went along, only to see Jack, Richard, and William there. I told David I didn’t want to talk to them, but he assured me they were there to apologize.

When we sat at their table, they were playing cards with other friends from our batch. I waited patiently, not wanting to make a scene in front of outsiders. David mentioned joining the next game, so I assumed he would bring up the apology once his turn came. When others left, David started playing, and Richard casually said, ""I heard there was a big fight yesterday."" I responded, ""Yes, David brought me here to hear your apologies."" Jack laughed and said, ""I’m the one waiting for an apology.""

I got angry—this time at David too. I told him I was leaving and he could come with me or stay and play, but if he stayed, we were no longer friends. He didn’t respond and continued playing. Feeling betrayed, I left, drove home, and immediately left the group chat. I blocked everyone except Mark, who wasn’t involved in any of this.

Life went on. I attended university and made new friends, though it was hard because they weren’t from my batch, and I’m naturally shy. Eventually, a new transfer student joined mid-year, and we became friends. He lived on my route, so I started picking him up and dropping him off, just as I used to do with David.

David noticed this and befriended the new student when I wasn’t around. I had started skipping lectures frequently, so I wasn’t at the university daily. After 3–4 months, David used his friendship with the new student to reach out to me, saying he and the others wanted to apologize.

We met in the university parking lot. Jack, Richard, William, David, Kevin, and Mark were all there. They apologized one by one, but their apologies felt insincere—half-joking, half-serious. I was annoyed because old batchmates kept asking me about the friend group, so I reluctantly accepted their apologies.

When it was Jack’s turn, I reminded David that Jack also needed to apologize to my parents for me to accept it. The group talked to Jack for a while, then came back to me, saying he refused to apologize to my parents. Richard suggested we move forward without apologies and rebuild our friendship as a group. After much thought and discussion with David, I agreed.

However, I rarely hung out with them after that and avoided being alone with Jack. My neighborhood friends became my main circle, and I spent most of my time with them. David and I became good friends again, though he remained close to Jack. Jack and I talked when the group was around, but it wasn’t like before.

After reliving all these moments while writing this, and remembering my mom’s comment, I’m wondering—am I the AH? Or is Jack the jacka*s (pun intended)?

Sorry for the long post! I’m not sure if this belongs here or in a venting subreddit, but I really want to hear other opinions.
And yes i used an ai to fix the spelling and grammar mistakes 

TL;DR:
I started a group chat for freshmen at university, which led to me becoming the ""coordinator"" for events and activities. Over time, my friends and I became close, but after I gave one friend (Jack) my ATM card to use for a restaurant, he and others ended up spending over $900 of my money. When I confronted Jack, he refused to return the card, and things escalated into a physical altercation. After trying to resolve things with my parents involved, I decided to cut ties with the group. Later, they apologized, but it felt insincere. Now, I’m wondering if I was wrong for cutting them off.

There are days when I can’t even manage to step off the floor for a drink of water, and I’m having a hard time thinking of how I’ll be able to step off for 15-20 minutes to pump and maintain my supply. It’s not that my job is preventing me from doing this but logistically it seems impossible, cause if I’m delaying my tasks by 20 minutes a few times. day then I will just end up having to leave late. We already have a large workload for the amount of people scheduled. I am going to try but I’ve had this job for almost 5 years and I know how it’s going to go. At least I have a lot of breastmilk frozen so we won’t have to switch to formula right away. ",1,1733857263.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False

I feel like I've dug through every source I can find.

In the middle of September (nearly 3 months ago), I started noticing pains in my hips and knees. I was able to work my usual 12 hour shifts at first, but within the next week or two, everything got worse. I started getting sharp pains all throughout my spine, horrible stiffness and pain in my knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, etc. It even hurt to move my fingers and I had a constant dull ache in my ribs. I also noticed muscle spasms.

In my worst state (2-3 weeks after symptoms started), I could barely walk or stand without supporting myself because my legs were so weak and shaky. I was in horrible pain all over, and I couldn't even hold a coffee cup or brush my hair without hurting. All of these symptoms completely put my life on halt, I did a lot of bedrest and I've been out of work since.

I had a full blood panel done at the start of October. My Vitamin D was 19.5, and my B12 was below 100. Everything else was clear and nerve involvement was ruled out.

I was put on a supplement course of 50,000IU D3 for 6 weeks and a B12 injection course later on down the line, and now most of my symptoms have resolved. I have a limp, and I still can't do a lot of the things I used to, but I'm on the path to recovery.

I'm shocked that a level of 19.5 can even cause so many severe problems, and I can't find anything on sudden symptom onset in the first place. Nothing else raised a red flag. Has anyone else been through similar?",3,1733857237.0,VitaminD,0,1.0,False

1hb99vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hb99vn/i_think_ive_been_cursed_by_my_childhood_friend/,I think I’ve been cursed by my childhood friend,"Twenty years ago, I lived in a small, remote village in the outskirts of Sindh, Pakistan. A village so isolated that it seemed untouched by time and the people clung to old stories, passed down through generations. Life was simple there, quieter than the bustle of the cities, and at times, it felt almost magical.

We had festivals every month or so—grand carnivals that brought Sufi singers, folk storytellers, and wandering traders. It was a celebration of life, community, and heritage. We would laugh and sing and play the traditional games that our ancestors had taught us. And at night, beneath a sky full of stars, the village elders would tell stories—tales of old Sindhi folklore, tales of love, religion, and bravery.

I grew up with only one other kid of my age and her name was Sahar. Our village was so remote that we spent nearly every moment together. We’d walk to school, a long trek that took us over dry hills and across narrow, winding paths. Sometimes we’d talk about the stories we heard from the elders, imagining we were the heroes or heroines of old, facing off against jinn and otherworldly forces.

But there was only one thing the elders warned us about more than anything else: *The Woods.*

The woods that stretched beyond the village were forbidden. They were thick and gnarled, tangled with roots and shadows that seemed to grow darker the deeper you went. There was an old woman who lived there, they said, a woman no one had seen in years. The elders would look at each other, their faces tightening with a fear they rarely showed, and they’d say, *""Stay away from the woods. She keeps to herself, but her presence is a bad omen, and if by chance you see her; don’t let her touch you.”*

We were children of course, so we obeyed our elders but there is only so much you can do in a village that doesn’t have any other entertainment available. We tried our best to avoid the woods even after coming home from school. We would end up playing ludo outside in the Otaq all night long as our elders played Sufi music together.

“Would you like to check it out?” Sahar asked me innocently

“No, Baba had forbidden us”

“Don’t be such a scaredy cat”

Suddenly, it had started raining and we all were forced to come inside our homes. We said our goodbyes and went to sleep.

The next morning, the sky was clear but it was a windy day. I had decided to not go to the school but the sound of Sahar outside my house had tempted me to give in. When we walked to the school, we found out that the school had been closed due to the heavy rain of last night and we had to walk back home.  

The sky had gotten a lot darker; I think there was a storm coming, most of the paths leading up to our village had been flooded and we couldn’t take the way back home easily. That’s when I felt my arm being pulled “I think we have to go through the woods”

“No way, you know Babajan would get mad”

“Well, it’s either that or we end up dying here. What do you suppose?”

She was annoying but she was right. I figured, Babajan would understand right?

The sky hung heavy with an oppressive darkness, clouds roiling and swirling like a tempestuous sea. The air was thick and laden with the earthy scent of wet soil, as if the very ground was exhaling its last breath. Each gust of wind sent shivers down my spine. The coldness settled in my bones, an unsettling chill that seeped deep, making me feel as if the very essence of life was being sucked out of me.

As we went deeper into the woods, the trees loomed over us, their twisted branches clawing at the air.

“What if we see her?”, I asked

“Don’t let her touch you or she’ll curse you” she teased;

The leaves rustled restlessly beneath our feet, and the shadows crowded us. We heard a branch snapped in the distance, and we saw her. 

*The old woman*

She was standing by the path, a bent, withered figure draped in tattered robes. Her skin hung off her bones, gray and cracked like ancient parchment, and her eyes— they were…. *milky white*, like she’d been blind for centuries. She looked right at us. No…she saw us, in a way that pierced through flesh and bone, straight into our souls.

“*Are you from the village?*” she asked, her voice as dry as the desert wind. I remember my throat closing up, the words sticking there like glue. Sahar nodded, too scared to speak.

The woman’s cracked lips twisted into something resembling a smile. “Be careful,” she rasped. “A plague is coming to your village. Stay away from the water.”

I tried to brush her off, laugh it away like the foolish child I was. But when I glanced at Sahar, her face had gone pale—white as a ghost. Her lips trembled, and before I could even say a word, she grabbed my arm and bolted. We ran, the sound of our footsteps and the rain splashing through the mud, until we reached the safety of the village.

“What happened?” I asked Sahar; “Why did we run?”

“That old woman, she is supposed to be dead…. dead for centuries…. she shouldn’t exist”

“It must have been someone playing a prank on us, we shouldn’t have run.”

“Do not speak of this to anyone; promise me?”

“Do not be a fool”

“I said, promise me!”; She yelled

“I promise” I replied

We never spoke of it again, not for a long time. But things began to change after that. Strange things. The air around the village felt heavier, thicker. Sahar was the first to shut herself away. She stopped coming to school, stopped leaving her house altogether. When I asked her why, all she would say was, “I saw her. I felt her. She touched me, she has cursed me.”

I didn’t believe her. I refused to believe her. But then, *she fell ill*.

It started with fever, then boils—dark, festering sores that erupted across her skin, she had a terrible fever for days until one day, she vomited blood, stood up and collapsed right on the floor.

It didn’t stop with her. It spread. First, it was a few people, then a few more. Soon, the entire village was stricken. No one could explain it—no doctor, no healer. The elders whispered that the old woman had returned to bring a curse, to punish us for trespassing into her woods. I heard them speak of it in hushed tones, but it wasn’t just talk anymore. It was real. The plague consumed the village, took everyone it could, including my parents.

The village was nothing but a graveyard now, the grounds was scattered with blood and disease-ridden bodies, I was the only one left alone, *why was I left alone?* I had to leave, I had to run away…I had no choice.

When I finally left, the land had turned sour. And eventually, the village itself faded from memory, swallowed by time and the sands of the desert. I didn’t dare go back, no one could. It was a cursed place. A place that didn’t exist to me anymore.

I moved to the city, made a life for myself—something I never thought I’d be able to do after everything I’d seen. I got married, started a family. My wife, my children—they became my world. And the village became a distant, shadowy dream. I told myself the curse had stayed behind, buried with the dead. The old woman had touched Sahar; she might have saved me from her curse; maybe that’s why I was spared.

*But last night, she came back.*

It started with a dream. At least, I think it was a dream. I woke to find Sahar standing in my bedroom, her figure barely visible in the dark, just a shadow against the wall. My heart raced, my mind screaming that it couldn’t be real—she was dead, long gone, buried in that forsaken village. But there she was. And I knew, deep down, that it wasn’t a dream.

She whispered; *""You survived before…but not anymore.""*

“Please don’t touch me!” I wanted to yell on top of my lungs but I couldn’t. I couldn’t move. My body was paralyzed with fear. I wanted to scream, to wake my wife, but I couldn’t.....

I woke up with a cold sweat the next morning, thanking God that it had all been nothing but a dream. I brewed my coffee and told my kids that they can skip the school today. I would be taking them to the zoo.

“Why?”

“Every day is a blessing, don’t forget darling”

The kids roared in excitement and we smiled from ear to ear. I had decided I would go into work today and take an early leave. I had some unfinished work to do.

I clocked into work and went straight to my desk to pick up some papers…. that’s when I heard my phone ring…it was…….my wife….

*“Baby…please come home quickly…. it’s our daughter…she’s vomiting blood….*

1hb97r6,https://i.redd.it/30ju1d53j26e1.jpeg,Looking for Input from the Hive Mind,"Hi, Coffee_Shop Redditors!

I’d love to get your advice on something. We all enjoy good coffee, but when we’re in a new area or city, we often rely on reviews from Google Maps. Sound familiar? The problem is, we also know there’s a ton of fake reviews out there. So, I started wondering: what can we do about it?

Here’s an idea I had: According to the theory of six degrees of separation, we’re all connected to almost everyone on the planet. If a real person writes a review, there’s a chance you’re connected to them—not directly, but through one, two, or three mutual friends or acquaintances.

What if there was a tool that could show you whether a specific review was written by a real person connected to you through mutual friends, rather than by some random John Doe? I feel like reviews from such people would be way more trustworthy.

Now, here’s my big question:
Is this a terrible idea? Should I give it a shot and try creating a service to help determine the authenticity of reviews, or is this concept just not something people would care about?

Any feedback would mean the world to me—even if it’s just to say, “Stop wasting your time, man.” If nothing else, it could save me weeks of effort! 😉

1hb94l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterfanfiction/comments/1hb94l7/a_weasley_potter_granger_christmas/,A Weasley Potter Granger Christmas ,"
Molly woke up early and leaving Arthur in bed she made her way downstairs. The house was dark and quiet, all the rooms lay empty, for now. She never thought she'd miss the occasional bang and clatter from the attic but even that had gone now too, the ghoul had left when all the children had moved out, the sudden quiet had unsettled it too much. She waved her wand as she descended the stairs and the house came to life in a vision of twinkling lights and crackling fires in the kitchen and living room. The sudden warmth washed over her and filled her with the excitement of another Weasley, Potter, Granger family Christmas. 

Originally they had done their own thing for Christmas with everyone traipsing around between all the family members but two years ago with both Hermione and Ginny pregnant and with 1 year olds on both sides, Harry and Ron had decided to visit and stay at The Burrow for Christmas and since everyone would normally visit everyone during Christmas, the result was that the Burrow ended up filled to the rafters with family. Molly had fussed and fretted about not having enough of everything or indeed enough space for everyone but it just worked, like magic and this year they were to have their 2nd full, family Christmas and she couldn't be happier. 

She waved her wand again and breakfast, lunch and dinner preparations began at once. Her eyes swept the Christmas tree, spotting the frozen Gnome on top and her eyes momentarily filled with tears before she started laughing. The sudden memory of Fred had filled her with sorrow but the memory of his humour and spirit lived on in the little touches here and there that different family members had contributed to the Burrow. George was responsible for the yearly Gnome fairy that lived on top of the Christmas tree, a throw back to the childrens teenage years. The underneath of the tree was already crammed with Christmas presents and there was still more to come. 

She glanced at the ceiling where she thought she heard the first signs of her husband stirring from their bed. Thinner than she liked him to be and a little older looking these days he was still consumed by the childish delight that Christmas brought and would no doubt be more excitable than most of the children. 

""Oh the children"" 

Molly muttered out loud. It was a good thing that she'd always wanted a large family and by golly had she gotten her wish. Today's festivities would see the arrival of not only her 6 children but also Fluer, Aubrey, Angelina, Hermione, Harry, Hagrid, Hugo, Jean and Andromeda would all arrive at some point during the day. That would also bring all 12 of Molly's grandchildren under one roof and of course where Harry was, so was Teddy Lupin. She gave a happy sigh as she imagined the chaos that was to come. 

She heard the hurried footsteps on the stairs seconds before Arthur burst into the kitchen, half annoyed, half exburant he questioned why she hadn't woken him. 

""I was only coming down to start the food, the others won't be here for at least another hour or so"" 

It did seem to be a Weasley trait, that even though everyone would arrive on time, the Weasley side always managed to look slightly rushed and harassed. 

She sat with Arthur, enjoying the blissful calm and eating some bacon sandwiches. She could see Arthur pretending to read the newspaper whilst listening attentively for the whoosh of the fire or the pop of Apparation from the garden that would signal the arrival of the first members of their family, secretly she was listening just as closely as he was. She was therefore incredibly shocked when a loud Crack signalled from the kitchen. She raced through to check on the food, only to find Kreacher in the middle of the kitchen floor. She clutched her chest

""Kreacher is sorry Mistress Weasley, Master sent Kreacher along ahead of them to offer his help with food"" 

Molly was greatful for the help, even if she was still a little shocked by the sudden appearance. She soon put him to work supervising the vegetables and watched for a second as he moved around the kitchen in a knitted jumper (she'd made it for him last year) and a pair of children's black dress trousers,she chuckled to herself. Harry had offered to free Kreacher but kreacher had refused. As a compromise, aided by Hermione and her work in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, Harry had instead offered Kreacher money that he could purchase his own clothes with and he (Harry) never ordered Kreacher to do anything, instead asking if he could or would mind helping out with something. 

She had just returned to the living room as the flames in the fire turned emerald and the first of what would be two little girls stepped out on to the rug. Molly ii looked just like her dad. At 8 years old she was tall and slim. She had missed out on the red hair but did have glasses exactly like her dad's. Who appeared revolving in the fireplace seconds later. Molly jamp up and embraced them both. She remebered only too vividly a time when she feared the estrangement of her third eldest son would last forever but now she stood with him safely in her arms eagerly awaiting the arrival of Percy's wife Audrey and their youngest daughter, 5 year old Lucy. 

If Percy was here the others wouldn't be far behind. 

Detaching herself from the fresh arrivals, Molly went to ask kreachers help in getting the breakfast food onto the table. 

A pop from the furthest corner of the garden heralded another arrival and when the sound of bickering reached her ears she knew Ron and Hermione were on their way in, she rolled her eyes, a smile pulling at the edge of her lips. If she didn't know the two of them so well she'd worry about them but arguments and squabbles had seen them safely and happily together for the last 11 years and now with 2 kids in tow they seemed as likely to spend their lives together as Arthur and herself. 

""Go show Granny Molly what you found Hugo"" 

""Dada, food"" 

""I know there's food, son but show granny Molly first"" 

Hugo reached out his hand to his granny and Molly took the card with curiosity, recognising it as a chocolate frog card but before she could look much closer Hugo, who appeared to be much more interested in the food shouted 

""IT NUNCLE NARRY NOW FOOD, please?"" 

Hermione rolled her eyes skyward 

""you have all the patience of your father, you will get food in a minute and only after you've slowed down and spoken nicely"" 

""sorry mama"" muttered Hugo turning red at the ears 

""it's OK baby boy, why don't you tell granny Molly whose on the card"" 

""it's Uncle Harry"" 

""what's me?"" 

came a confused voice from the doorway. In the commotion over the chocolate frog card they hadn't heard the Potter's appearance in the yard or their messy entrance through the front door as the two boys had evidently tried to enter the house at the same time and tripped over each other. 

Hugo took the card from Molly and presented it instead to Harry as Ginny helped both boys off the floor. 

""it's you""

rang the little boys voice, triumphantly, as though finding this card was a great personal achievement. Harry smiled as he turned the card over to see the picture of himself. He still throughly enjoyed the fact that all of the Harry's in wizarding photos looked as though they were trying to escape the confines of the frame. Lily giggled as she pointed at the card from her vantage point on her dad's hip

""daddy"" she mumbled and giggled again. 

""still a scrawny git, though, aren't ya"" 

""GEORGE!"" 

Molly scolded before laughing at the timid look that had appeared on his face from being caught. 

""The kids have that same look when I tell them off too"" laughed Angelina looking at George's face with amused interest. 

""We were at Bill's a couple days ago and he says they'll be here at lunch time, they are going to nip over and visit Fleur's family first and Hagrid's coming from the Leaky Cauldron, he caught the Hogwarts Express the other day so I wouldn't wait around for him either"" said George. 

""Hermione dear do you know when Jean and Hugo will arrive?"" 

""mum said they should be here around lunchtime"" 

""just Charlie then and we can start breakfast"" 

""HE'S HERE"" rang Percy's voice from the living room and with that the family headed towards the breakfast table. 

There was much talk and laughter as breakfast was consumed with all the children, bar Molly and Lucy who waited for permission to leave the table, ending up in the living room and edging closer and closer to the now overflowing stack of presents beneath the tree. 

""we'll open presents after lunch little ones"" chided Molly 

and instead they played duck, duck, goose, a Muggle game that Jean and Hugo had taught the kids last year. Whilst the adults drank tea and coffee and caught up with the latest goings on in all their lives. James as was his personality, got bored of duck, duck, goose and instead spent the better part of their wait for the others, intently examing the new and very shiny 4 inch scar on his uncle Charlie's arm. 

""what did it?"" asked James

""A nursing Hungarian Horntail, they get very aggressive when they become mum's"" 

""I know all about that"" added Harry, earning himself a swipe to the side of his head by Ginny. 

""I meant I got injured by the mothering one I faced at Hogwarts"" said Harry indignantly 

""oh sorry"" replied Ginny as she gave the side of his head a quick peck and the children all pulled faces. 

""talking of Hogwarts, how's Teddy finding it?"" inquired Molly, 

Harry suddenly had the attention of the adults and all the children. Teddy was the first to begin at Hogwarts and wouldn't be followed by anyone else for another 2 years when Bill's daughter Victorie would be going.

""He was nervous to begin with, so much history behind and ahead of him but between me, Ginny and Andromeda we did what we could to prepare him, he seems OK now, loves his classes and with turquoise hair, he's already making a bit of a name for himself outside of what the other kids might know him for""

Molly nodded in a knowing way, poor Teddy entered Hogwarts with almost the same sort of backstory as Harry had, except that Teddy was so incredibly loved during all of his childhood. He spent half his time with a grandma who adored him and the other half with a godfather who treated him the same as any of his other sons and daughter. 

Bill, Fleur, Victorie, Dominique, Louis, Jean, Hugo, Hagrid, Andromeda and Teddy all arrived simultaneously through different methods and caused quite the commotion. Teddy who hadn't seen Harry since he had waved at him through the window on the Hogwarts Express, ran at his Godfather and hugged him tightly. Molly had a sudden flashback to a much younger Harry hugging his Godfather. Teddy and Harry might not look like family, with Teddy so closely resembling Remus, even with turquoise hair but the family bond was there nonetheless. You'd be forgiven for questioning what parts of Tonks, aside from the obvious, Teddy got, what with him looking so much like his father until young Teddy walked into a room or open space and appeared to trip over thin air. It was one of these incidents that brought the chaos of the new arrivals to an end as Harry and Teddy broke away from each other and Teddy took a step back to hug Ginny and tripped backwards onto little Hugo. A well placed and quickly produced cushioning charm from the ever ready wand of Hermione however stopped anyone getting hurt and after a quick chuckle from all involved and a mumbled, embarrassed apology from Teddy, it was time for Christmas Lunch. 

Molly's feasts could rival any at Hogwarts and with Kreachers help it went off almost as smoothly. Everyone chatted and laughed easily as every few minutes smoke and bangs engulfed the table from another wizard cracker. Harry nearly choked on a Brussel Sprout as Ginny placed a hat on her head that very closely resembled the one that Neville had forced the Boggart Severus Snape to wear and his eyes drifted for a second to his middle child, Albus Severus, who was currently trying to trap a miniature Acromantula that had come out of the cracker he'd pulled with Lily and was causing both her and Ron a great deal of upset. Molly laughed as she surveyed the table checking everyone had at least some of everything on their plates. During lunch the Harry chocolate frog card was passed around. 

""I remember you saying you three were going to be on these"" remarked Bill 

""why are you trying to escape Arry"" 

Harry just laughed, he still wasn't a fan of having his picture taken unless Ginny and or the kids were in the picture too. The trio had been offered a card each when they were first printed but said, as collectors, it would be cheating. So they had waited to see who would find who first and Hugo was very proud of himself that it was him who had found the first of the three. 

They left the lunch table, all with silly hats, the adults with sleepy faces but the kids had enough energy and excitement to fill the whole house twice. Molly stoked the fire again as more snow fell outside and the room filled with golden light and excited voices as the first of the presents made their way out from under the tree and carefully directed by Molly's wand, found their recipiants. The adults exchanged silly but heartfelt presents with each other and the kids rejoiced in the mixture of wizard and muggle presents they received (Jean and Hugo liked seeing them play with the same toys Hermione had enjoyed as a child and they always brought extras for Arthur too). As was now a Weasley, Potter, Granger tradition any child's second Christmas saw them gifted a toy broomstick from Harry and Ginny, so Lily and Hugo spent the afternoon zooming around the living room giggling incessantly on their little brooms as their toes brushed the carpet closely pursued by Crookshanks. James, Albus and Rose spent most of the afternoon trying to work out how to use their Weasley Wizard Wheezes products on each other. While Victorie and Teddy were to be found sat beside a window huddled together

""Teddy Lupin I hope you are not using magic outside of school"" Andromeda reprimanded 

""no granny"" 

replied Teddy whilst he continued to show Victorie the effects of Wingarduim Leviosa on the Quidditch stadium and model team that Harry and Ginny had got him. Much attention was shown in the gift that Molly had asked Hermione to find for her, to gift to Arthur and the collection 'For Dummies' muggle books were passed around with interest. 'Aviation For Dummies' seemed to be particulary worthy of study with Bill and Charlie looking at it for half an hour trying to work out what the non moving diagrams were trying to depict. Arthur's present to Molly was also widely admired as she opened a jewellery box to reveal a sparkling silver necklace covered in stars. On closer inspection the larger star at the top help Arthur's name with two smaller stars next to it holding Fred and Charlie's names. Underneath these stars were five more each filled with the names of their other children and in little chains dangling from each name and punctuated by more stars were the names of Molly's grandchildren each attached to the parent above them and in descending age order. The necklace made Molly slightly emotional and she excused herself to the kitchen. She returned back, with the necklace on to see the last of the presents make their way to their new owners and as each of the 28 squishy parcels made their way around the room everyone, including Kreacher prepared to put on a new jumper. Molly took great pride in these jumpers. She knitted them throughout the year and tried to personalise each one as best she could. This years favourites were Lily and Hugo's who had matching jumpers in different colours with lots of flying broomsticks decorating them and Teddy's jumper which she'd dyed with colour changing ink so he could customise it with whichever colour matched his hair. 

As the evening wore on Arthur was found sat in a corner with one of the children's cup and ball toys giggling to himself everytime he managed to swing the ball up and land it in the cup. Hagrid was sat in a reinforced chair by the fire singing out of tune and slightly too loud Christmas carols with a very sleepy Hugo, Lily and Louis swaying on his lap. Jean was sat on the couch reading 'the night before Christmas' to an enraptured Victorie, Molly, Lucy and Dominique. Fleur was periodically checking her watch, in two minds as to whether Celestine Warbeck's Christmas songs would be better or worse than Hagrid's singing. 

Missing from the festivities however were George and Fred ii, at 7 years old Fred ii was the perfect age to make an efficient and inconspicuous partner in crime to George's yearly Christmas prank (despite the fact that everyone was already preparing themselves for what was to come). So the two boys were stood out in the snowy yard hatching a plan whilst Angelina kept 'watch' whilst really looking at her daughter Roxanne using the Quidditch set with James, Albus and Teddy to play a two aside match. She's already got the strategical mind of a great player, thought Angelina as her boys whispered to her that they were ready. 

George and Fred ii re-entered the house and dashed upstairs and down for a good 20 minutes before seating themselves back on the sofa with a discreet high five. Ginny looked wearily at her older brother and nephew 

""I'm about to put the little ones to bed, if something wakes them as I go up the stairs you'll be seeing bat bogeys until New year's George"" ranted Ginny

""you'll be fine"" smirked George 

""we'll do it"" replied Harry, indicating himself and Ron

""what's this 'WE'"" grumbled Ron who was already half asleep 

""why's it always 'WE'?"" 

""Go help Harry"" intoned Hermione and Ron got to his feet mumbling about how nothing good could come of the two of them and three little ones walking into one of George's pranks. Fred ii tried to smirk like his dad but ended up looking like he was in pain. Slowly the other children started to succumb to sleep too until eventually it was only the adults and Celestine's warbles that filled the living room. Hagrid had long since fallen sideways off his chair and was currently snoring under a blanket provided by kreacher, looking like an absurdly large cat curled up beside the fireplace. The rest of the adults were held in trepidation, Fred ii and George's prank still hadn't materialised and the longer it took the more on edge they all became. Ginny continued to threaten George with all manner of unpleasantness if his Prank woke the kids, a threat now also being issued by Fleur, Angelina, Audrey and Hermione. As time wore on and the fire grew smaller in the grate there was nothing for it but for the adults to go to bed and face whatever prank lay in wait for them. So with much tip toeing and peering round corners Bill and Fleur, Percy and Audrey, Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Harry climbed the stairs to their rooms. Charlie, George and Angelina followed behind but nothing happened. It transpired the Fred ii and George had decided to do nothing but act as though they had, causing distress with minimal effort. George received a lot of mumbled curses for the anxiety they had all faced from simply climbing a staircase and Bill whacked George round the back of the head but they all climbed into bed with a smile on their faces. 

""well mollywobbles I think that was a successful Christmas, don't you?"" 

""mmmmm I hope so"" mumbled Molly 

""let's go to bed before we meet the kids coming down for breakfast in the morning"" chuckled Arthur 

""I'll be just a minute, I'm going to check on Kreacher"" replied Molly. 

So alone, Arthur climbed the stairs as always questioning why there was so many stairs. While Molly went into the kitchen to find Kreacher eating some of the leftovers. 

""Sorry Mistress Weasley do you need kreachers help?"" 

""no kreacher I was just making sure you didn't want a bed to sleep on"" 

""I like the floor Mistress Weasley"" 

""OK then so long as your sure but I'll leave the fire burning so you don't get cold"" 

muttered Molly slightly uncomfortably as kreacher pulled a blanket on top of himself and settled down to sleep. Molly waved her wand as she crossed the living room and all the lights went out as she herself climbed the stairs. This morning the house had felt too large, empty and dark. This evening it was full to bursting and even in the darkness it seemed to shine with a happy light as though it made the house, itself as happy as it made her to have it full of family members. 

Molly shut her eyes on another Weasley, Potter, Granger Christmas and hoped for many more like it.

 I'd posted here a while back, asking for recommendations, which i recieved in plenty. I did as many as I could, and had the best time. 
 The food is incredible (the bakeries are maybe the best I've experienced), you guys know how to bread!
 The bars (when you find the right ones) are great and very welcoming.
 The architecture is absolutely amazing, as is all of the street art.
 The coffee, probably the best in the world, maybe the strongest too ha.
 The history. I don't think there are many (if any) that have such an intense and important history.

 But most importantly, the people, you guys are incredibly welcoming. I learnt quickly that a simple ""Ćao"" or  ""Hvala"" go a very long way. I've never felt so welcomed and looked after. After reading some experiences for travellers here, I was expecting people to be quite frosty and cold, I found it to be the opposite.

 Once again Sarajevo, thank you. I will certainly be back, I still need to see a football game!

As the title suggests, I’m looking for advice on using the Kalita brewer—specifically how it compares to the V60 and any tips you’d recommend for getting the best results.

**A little background:**

* I’ve been using the V60 and Chemex for about 3 years now, and I consistently get good-to-great cups. Recently, I picked up a Kalita and I’m excited to dive in and see what it can do!
* **Grinder:** Timemore C3.
* **Recipes I’ve used:** For the V60, I’ve had the most consistent success with James Hoffmann’s updated recipe (for 1 cup) and the 4:6 method. I usually brew with 15-20g of coffee.
* **Taste preference:** I love sweet, fruity cups and gravitate towards medium-light roasts. My goal is to pull out as much of the fruit flavor as possible.

**My question:** What should I keep in mind when brewing with the Kalita? Do you recommend changing anything compared to V60 brewing? And do you have any favorite recipes or techniques I should try?

Thanks in advance for your tips! ",3,1733856546.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

1hb8xcr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hb8xcr,"AIO, my boyfriend threatened sewerslide ","Hi everyone, apologies in advance for the incoming wall of text.
I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (20M) for over two years. We are kind of long distance but live in the same state and has stayed with me for extended periods of time before, even moved in until my mom had enough of our arguing. 
He’s was out of work since he moved back home and recently got a job at the same company I work at, just a different location. 
In our company, your first paycheck is paper. Cash app won’t deposit the money until the 14th which he’s reasonably upset about. 
If i could help him I would. My cat has been hospitalized since friday for a life threatening UTI and I owe them over $6K that my family is helping me pay. I’ll be paying them back for the next 3 months. He’s been upset that I can’t help him. 
For context, I also keep my money in cash to avoid overspending and only small amount on my card for gas and coffee. I help him when I can but I can’t really mail him cash. I quite literally have nothing right now because of my cat being hospitalized. 
We have a history of arguing a lot, and it always ends in me trying to figure out what I’m doing wrong, what our barriers are, etc. and it’s always come down to my lack of communication. I’ve been working on it for, hell, a year? But I don’t seem to be doing it right, at least based on our conversations and arguments. 
He has a history of suicide baiting me. He’s cut himself in front of me, he’s threatened suicide every other day for as long as I can remember, he’s always talking about how much he hates his life. Normally he will say it’s because of me, something I said, things I’m not doing, because I don’t understand, because I lack empathy and sympathy, etc. He’s called the abuse hotline on me, he’s gotten on reddit and has come back to me saying that everyone thinks i’m abusive, he tells me that his family thinks he needs to leave me, etc. 
I didn’t think I was that awful of a person but when all of this happens and i’m being told it’s because of me, it makes me question it. 
Anyways, today he was going on about his frustration with his finances. Valid. I tried to support him and be there, but then he tells me that even if I could help, I wouldn’t? That’s not true I don’t know why he thinks that. I bought his groceries for 3 months, paid his phone bill, filled his gas tank, everything I could. 
Then he pulls out the “fuck you” card. Then I get pissed off and sick of it because this seems to happen too often. Then he starts this whole “I have the rope goodbye” stunt and I just threw my hands up at that point because what the fuck? 
When I was 12-13 I used to pull that shit online and he does it so often that I have gotten to where I see through it like glass and don’t pay it attention. For the first 1.5 years I took it seriously because I love him but now I just can’t. I have no words. It’s draining. He’s not dead he’s texting me as I’m typing this asking if we can talk and saying he’s scared I’ll stop loving him. 
Am i over reacting? Am I in the wrong? Please call me out if it’s deserved, because I just don’t know what to do. 
I’m not the type of person to ignore my faults because I definitely have some but I don’t know what warrants this stuff.
He’s called me “stupid fucking bitch” , ungrateful, heartless, the devil, etc. 
By the way, he never had to beg me for money. I am the store manager at my location so I’m always being pulled in different directions. Even when I’m not there. I had to ask my mom to send me digital money in exchange for cash because I had nothing left. He asked me to keep more money on my card to help him in his time of need. 
Anyways… 
Again, please call me out if I deserve it. Tell me what I’m doing wrong because he won’t. 
Thank you in advance and apologies for the long message. ",167,1733856279.0,AmIOverreacting,614,0.83,False

Observed Activity: 

sorcella ravine woke up at 04:00 hrs and was served a lavish meal in bed. black coffee, eggs, waffles, and pineapple. Upon concluding breakfast, sorcella ravine engaged in swift self care activity such as showering, brushing teeth, dressing in official E.O.N. uniform. 

At 05:00 hrs, she arrived by teleportation spell to her office in the E.O.N. headquarters and began balancing books, checking the cattail city stock market on her orb,  filling out paperwork, telling interns and apprentices to make photocopies.  1 bathroom break detected lasting 350 seconds. 

At 09:00 hrs, sorcella ravine met with arcane forensic specialists to determine just how the Treasury was robbed, even if the robbery did next to nothing to harm the economy. She took notes as fast as people talked using mage hand and sentient pen. 

At 12:00 hrs, sorcella ravine met with bombast  Lord of time and an individual referred to as that one guy Chris to discuss the findings of the arcane forensic specialists and how to better the security system. Location of the currency printing plates was not discussed. Sending imposter automata to spy on the p.o.i. in the meeting. The meeting lasted two hours, and lunch was provided.

At 14:00hrs, sorcella ravine continued engaging in paperwork, balancing books, approving and denying loans.  Drafting an EON budget proposal, having those beneath her making photocopies.

At 16:00hrs , sorcella ravine teleported to cattail city to meet with king khan Penrose about the threat us thieving automata pose to the world.  Tiny mechanical spyders followed thru the rift to implant themselves in hidden advantageous vantage points where vermensk wouldn't think to look.

Sorcella ravine did not seem dismissive of the vermensk concerns. In fact, every word was being jotted down.  Cattail city was already on lockdown by vermensk decree. The meeting lasted about 2 hours. At 18:00 hrs, sorcella ravine teleported to her home where she went over the days events over a lavish meal. A butler who was already an imposter, noted that shrimp scampi, garlic bread, and champagne was served. 

At 17:00 hrs, sorcella ravine burned her notes in the fireplace and began night time self care activity.  A majority of it was spent relaxing in a bubbly hot tub. 

At 19:00 hrs, sorcella ravine climbed into bed, talking in her sleep about some thesis. 
Probably dreaming about her time in school.

Hey Reddit!

This is the first time being back home in almost a decade, I live in the east coast but due to a slight career shift and now working remote I decided it's time I finally spend some time with the family.

I've always been the black sheep of the family never really fitting in with them nor having any similar interests with them kinda leads to the wanting to escape them from time to time haha.

About me:
- I am 6'1"" muscular build, hazel eyes, bald (by choice!!), have a well maintained beard, and I wear glasses. I am born and raised in LA near Burbank but I moved to the east coast.

- I work in the fitness industry in marketing and consulting, so being in gyms and working always has always come along with the career but my love for working out and bodybuilding lead me to the field.

- I am a foodie at heart, especially for sushi or a good coffee shop. My old favorite sushi spot closed down so pretty bummed about that and I am trying to find another spot ASAP.

- At most times I have music playing in the background and even going in long drives to listen to a new album or EP is a guilty pleasure of mine.

- Haven't decided how long I am staying in LA for, but it'll be for a while I think. At least until
Things warm up back on the east coast.

I work the night shift in a data entry position at a struggling division of a firm that's desperate to stay afloat. It's boring, repetitive and mentally taxing. Our small team handles grunt work while everything important happens during the day. Most nights, I feel like a nocturnal animal, clawing away at my keyboard, pouring my sanity for something that's less than mediocre. The survey papers stack in hundreds, and its my job to fit them into spreadsheets.

Time hasn't been really kind to me lately. I rarely catch any actual sleep during the day, and it's jarring for me to keep going through. My job pays well above my expectations, and the leads really don't care for the hours since its a new project and they want results as soon as possible, which requires I compile the data. I've been at it for months now, and I really want a release. I can't build up the courage to quit because I fear I won't be compensated so well anywhere else.

My shift runs 9 PM to 5:30 AM, though it always feel longer. To keep myself sane, I usually put on a playlist as I type away. It's the same mix every night, songs I know by heart. Everything I do feels stale lately and I decided to try something new tonight, or wait - maybe it was last night. Anyways. I was late into my shift. I had switched to a random radio mix on my streaming app, hoping to add some flavour to this drudgery. It was around 3:37 AM when it met me. The title of the song caught my eye, ""It's just a burning memory"", the artist listed as ""The Caretaker"".

It wasn’t like anything I had ever heard before. A constant melody looped endlessly, as though trapped in a forgotten era. It was soft, distant, but insistent—a waltz that seemed to float just beyond reach, constantly repeating itself in a way that felt wrong, like a memory you could never quite recall. The gentle melody was dissonant, warped in a static hiss that cracked and popped like an old radio struggling to get in range. It slipped through the cracks of my brain, and left behind only a faint echo. The more I listened, the more it felt as though it sunk deeper into my mind, a reflection on an alternate life where I had died.

I already had a sharp pain at the back of my head that night, and I couldn't really appreciate what I heard. Maybe something avant-garde, but it just didn't fit my taste. The song stretched for four  minutes that felt like an hour, and that's when I noticed something. The duration was off, just the blank ""--:--"" staring at me, where I'd usually see a timestamp. I glanced at the system clock, 3:37 AM. It had been so for quite a while. Minutes passed, five, ten... it remained indifferent, and the song looped endlessly.

I yanked off my earphones and shut the music off, a hum still buzzing faintly in my ears. I needed to clear my head. My hands shook as I put the system to sleep, saving my work. I felt my ears wet and bleed, and the pain gnaw at the back of my skull. The vending machine by the elevator lobby was my usual escape. The floor was deserted, but that was my typical night shift; or at least.. it should have been. The machine hissed as it dispensed a foam cup of warm coffee. I took it with trembling hands, hoping it'd erase my headache. It did provide comfort as it touched my dry lips. The bitterness took to my tongue, and as I turned back towards my desk, I froze.

The floor looked different.

The corridor should have led directly to my workstation, but now it stretched impossibly far, the fluorescent lights flickering to the distance. The walls were rather further apart, and the space yawned in unnatural proportions. I took another slow slip of coffee, but soon hurdled it down my throat as I began to panic. I threw the cup into the bin. The thud sounded an echo in the silence of buzzing lights and the low tread of my footsteps on the carpet.

I took to the large glass window by the lobby. The city outside was cloaked in thick fog that swallowed everything in sight. Only the streetlamps pierced the haze and their glow was pale and sickly, casting long shadows on the empty streets. No cars. No people. Nothing moved. 

The buildings stood still, their windows lit but lifeless. My heart pounded as I turned away from the sight. I needed clarity, or at least someone to reassure me.

Adi, the system admin, was usually in the server room at this hour, running important backups. I came upon my co-worker Marsh's desk as I hurried, only to see it unnaturally placed. His chair was pushed back and his system was down with a blank, blue screen. There was no sign of him, but his chair was warm to the touch. It was as if he left with everything in its place.

I pressed on to the server room. The corridor that led there felt longer than I remembered, the air still and cold. I peered into the room, pushing the door gently inwards. I made myself halfway in, searching the room. I saw rows of humming computers extending endlessly. ""Adi?"" I called, but my voice vanished into the hum. Nothing. 

In the distance, as my vision focused, I could see, under a flickering tube-light hanging erratically between the boxed computers - a figure tied to a chair. Thick, strong wiring wrapped around its neck, the body hanging limply as if the life had been drained from it. The shirt was torn open, exposing bare, mangled skin, bloodied and raw. In place of a mouth was a gaping, hollow, rubber-like hole yawned wide - toothless. Its sockets were empty, face was frozen in a harrowing expression, a twisted mask of terror and pain - like it had screamed in its final moments, but the scream had never been released. 

The acrid stench of rotting flesh slowly met my nostrils, suffocating. A sudden metallic clang ran from one corner of the large room, a loud shriek aching my pained ears. It was very human, very discordant, as if a tormented metal throat screamed in pain. My heart thundered through my chest, as I had never witnessed an image so grotesque, so utterly wrong in all my life. But soon, as the shriek grew, the chair jolted toward me at an unnatural speed. The figure shook like it had a seizure and finally crashed upon the door.

I could see its face hit the square window etched into the door. 

I backed out immediately as it began to bang itself on the door, each thud growing louder. I knew I had to leave, and get out of the building- ASAP. The elevator. 

I reached the elevator and smashed the button for the ground floor. I caught a breath, trying to process what I saw. The elevator groaned as it descended, but the display kept ticking past G; -1, -2, -3... I gripped the rail as it slid lower, deeper than the building should go.

It came to a sudden halt. The doors opened with a groan, revealing a parking lot bathed in pale, artificial light. I do not remember the building having basements at all. It had at its lowest, just the ground floor.

I stepped out cautiously. There were more cars parked than there were people in the office building.

I climbed a flat ramp to make it to the streets. The building was not the same. It wasn't our HQ. I didn't know where I was. In the distance, I could see a taxi idled under a street lamp. Its headlights bore into the thick fog. I had an uneasy feeling and felt like approaching it, but I really did not know what I was expecting. The city felt dead, or maybe I was.

I approached cautiously. I could make out the silhouette of driver sat inside through the windshield. He was an older man in a slick, worn jacket. His cold eyes stared blankly into the distance, face pale. His expression was very static, almost unnatural - like a doll. I knocked gently on the window, and his head snapped towards me, the motion too sudden and rigid. I flinched. His lips curled into smirk as one of his brows gently frowned.

He rolled down the window, and I stammered, *""Can you... take me home? Clover Apartments?"".* I had tried to call my wife quite a few times, but the line was dead. *""Do you know if there's a signal here? My phone's not-""* 

He interrupted, *""Payphone. Just across the corner.""*, his head nudging to the side as his gaze locked upon me.

I hesitantly nodded, and searched my pockets for a dime. My pulse quickened as I slid it into the slot, waiting anxiously for the line to connect as I dialled home. It stood beneath a flickering light, the rusted frame barely holding it together. 

As the line clicked and I heard static, I began - *""Anna, dear.. something's wrong. Are you okay? I'm on my way --"",* and was abruptly cut.

*""Come home, Joe. We miss you. It's been too long.""*, her soft voice spoke.

The line went dead.

I stood perplexed. Something about how she talked wasn't right. Her voice felt alien and hollow, and I swear I heard a deep voice beneath hers rumbling faintly, like a second voice layered beneath. Why did she talk that way? What was she talking about? I still have no clue. 

I turned, startled to find that the taxi had moved - unnaturally, sliding closer behind me while I was on the phone. The driver's grin grew wider, and too wide.. teeth flashing as his excited eyes ate into mine. Everything about him was very off. *""Let's get you home, son.""* he said, tone disturbingly pleasant but hollow. My legs felt weak as I walked to the passengers seat. I had to get home. I was lost. I felt I could trust him, but that was naive of me. His head turned to follow me, the movement jerky and unnatural. I slid into the seat, feeling his eyes on me the entire time.

*""Perfect,""* he murmured as I shut the door, starting the ignition.

As we moved through the foggy streets, the driver's cold eyes never left me in the rear view mirror. I felt really uneasy. The journey felt like hours, and I really couldn't recognize any of the streets we were on. Not until we reached my block.

The taxi dropped me off by the entrance of my apartment complex.

As I stepped out of the taxi to grab some cash from my wallet, he interrupted, *""Don't bother.""* I couldn't place why he didn't ask for any money. 

As he began to drive off, he remarked, ***""You don't belong here.""*** and faded into the distant fog. 

I couldn't make anything of what he meant to say. Standing there, as confused as I was, I broke off from the thoughts that raced my head. 

I slowly entered the complex. The reception was empty. *The power was out.* I took the steps to the second floor through the stairwell, and made it to my apartment, feeling my way and working my memory in the darkness. The door was left open. *Interesting.*

There was no point in trying for the lights. The entire building was plunged in darkness. The air was eerily still, and I couldn't even hear any faint signs of life on the floor. 

I called for Anna as I tread in. She just wasn't there. I knew it. The apartment was empty, but a musky, deathly scent caught my nostrils. It was cold too, and I really couldn't help but feel ill. As I went inside, I felt something watched me. My head had felt stiff for the past few minutes, but the pain had subsided. Of course, I felt lighter, but everything I was experiencing was just out of place and something I really could not fathom as I write this.

I recall going to the bathroom to splash some cold water on my face, trying to freshen up. I stared at my reflection in the mirror, and my face began to distort around the edges. I knew my brain was playing tricks on me. I shut the tap, and it was just then.. as I remember, I heard faint, distant laughter break the uneasy silence. *It was coming from the living room,* through where I had just entered. I could hear the TV talk in some foreign language I had never heard. 

I slowly walked toward the living room, my breath coming shallow.

And then I saw him.

Mr. Anderson, sitting on the couch, his eyes glued to the TV, chuckling at something on the screen. That couldn't be right. **Mr. Anderson had died months ago.** 

*""Mr. Anderson?""* my voice trembled.

He smiled as he turned to me, *""Joe! Check out this new show I found. It's hilarious!""* He chuckled, the dim light from the TV screen shining on his glasses.

The show was bizarre. A warped sitcom that kept glitching. The laughter was too loud, unnervingly high pitched, like a laugh track on a loop. The characters' faces were obscured in odd static bursts, and the background kept shifting - as though they kept changing the set again and again. From a mall, to a kitchen to a morgue. The people in the show wore uncanny skin masks, and something was very wrong about the unmatching outfits and discordant voices.

Mr. Anderson often came home early weekend evenings to have a chat or a cup of his favourite lemon tea. Him being here, now, at this hour, and long dead, made me cripple. I shook, *""Mr. Anderson, you've been.. you've been dead for months. You - you can't be here. I remember.. attending your funeral..""* And trust me when I say that. He had no family of his own, never married. Anna and I were probably the only people other than his brother that knew him best.

*""Dead? What are you talking about, Joe? I'm right here.""* he chuckled, tapping the side of his temple, *""You know, some people can't just handle a good laugh.""* Everything I remember about him was so close to this apparition I was witnessing. I knew I was hallucinating. He leaned back, completely at ease, and switched the TV off. *""Anyways, Anna's out at the pharmacy down the block. She went to get some melatonin. She's been disturbed lately, poor thing.""* he paused. *""She forgot to lock the door again, and that's why I'm here. Watching over.""*

Disturbed? She never said a thing to me about being disturbed. What was going on? And how did Mr. Anderson, *or whoever this was*, know? **Why could I see him?**

*""I won't bother you much Joe. I think you need some rest.""* he rose, dusting himself off. *""I'll be back tomorrow, now that you're here. Just wanted to check in on you, son.""* As he left, he smiled and remarked, an uncanny shine in his eyes, *""And... take care of Anna.""* he walked out in stiff, unusual movements, his footsteps fading down the hallway. 

I choked up. I still couldn't understand what was happening. I recall stumbling through the apartment, trying to make sense of it all. I found my way to a room where pictures from my past hung on walls as a memorial to the time that flew by. Pictures, from my wedding day, my childhood, and memories now I only wish I could recreate. It stung when I realized that the life I lived was not the one I had imagined for myself.

**This was the room we'd planned for a child, but never had. Never could.** 

It felt wrong, like I shouldn't be here. Anna was always so sensitive about this space. I sat down on the small bed, head in my hands.. trying to get over my thoughts. I stared at the photos pinned to the walls. The wedding photo. Anna's expression seemed forced, too rigid. And my smile? Hollow. *I couldn't remember the moment as it was captured.*

I glanced at a gallery on the wall, pictures from my childhood. I saw my parents. Together on days they'd spend just for me, and act like we were a happy family. I had cherished those memories, until now.

Something was off.

I noticed, on every photograph, the younger me, was missing. I wasn't there. Just my parents. In fact, they embraced themselves. Like a loving couple. None of these could pass my memory. What was going on? 

Just then, I saw a child stand by the doorframe, fidgeting curiously with a familiar toy from my childhood in his hands. My favourite, a wooden toy plane - the one I used to carry everywhere.. dressed in overalls I often wore as a child.

And then I realized. 

**It was the younger me.** 

The curious child, barely seven, walked up to me. ""Do you wike my twoy?"" he asked innocently. I trembled as I replied, ""I do."" my throat tight. The boy smiled, nodding as he closed in, flying his plane, ""Cawptain joe.. cawptain.. take to the sky!"" he giggled. I began to break into tears as I asked, ""Where ... are your parents?"", and the boy said, ""Dunno"", shrugging, unbothered.

My heart ached, and suddenly, memories from my childhood began to flood my mind. The loneliness, the neglect. The way I never felt at home. I couldn't hold it in anymore. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I reached out, pulling the child into an embrace.

I cried for the childhood I never had. For the warmth, that I never felt. ""I'm sorry... I'm so, so sorry."", I choked.

But as I held him, the boy's body grew unnaturally cold. His skin was too smooth, too pale. The warmth faded away until it felt like I held a figure of warm wax. He fell silent. The toy slipped from his hands and hit the floor with a soft clink. I pulled away, horrified. The boy's eyes were pitch black, body slugging in my arms. Before I could react, he limped and down he collapsed to the floor with a sickening thud. 

I stared in shock as ants began to swarm his lifeless form, spilling in from unseen cracks, heaping over the body like a tide of foragers. They writhed over him, eating away his skin. My stomach churned. They crawled into his mouth, ears, eyes - consuming his body.

I shrieked, my pulse racing, stumbling toward the door. The boy was still, motionless - the ants heaping over him. I crawled backwards, and shut the door behind me hurriedly.

I slouched against the cold wall, my head hung low and tired, chest heaving. Exhaustion took over as I slipped into a restless slumber, my eyes tired and burning. 

I wake up disoriented - my eyes heavy, head pounding. Everything felt hazy, distant. I blinked a few times and my surroundings came into focus. 

I see Anna lying in bed, her breath soft and even. Relief flooded me, and I sprung to my knees, limping in a rush towards the bedroom.

""Joe?!"" she murmured, startled, sitting up. She switches on a lamp by our bed. Her eyes were half-open, groggy and concerned. ""You're... you're here,"" she remarked. ""You're okay!?"" my sore voice cracked. ""Of course, I'm okay... you're the one shaking. What's wrong?"" said her voice, confused.

And honestly, I didn't know how to answer. How could I explain what I had seen? What I felt?

Seeing her here, safe and sound, made my horror feel like a distant nightmare. However, I first thought it was a wicked trick my brain played on me. 

""You're scaring me,"" she whimpered softly as I stared into her eyes, traumatized. ""Hey... just come to bed, okay? It's been.. been a long week."" she said, eyes not quite meeting mine. 

""Yeah,"" I whispered. ""Maybe.""

She sighed, ""Come to bed soon,"" and she switched off the lamp. There I stood in the darkness.

Now it's early morning, the clock on my desk reads 6:41 AM. I stand by the window, peeking through the blinds. The city is awake, alive, breathing - or as I see it is. The distant hum of traffic and the first rays of sunlight make it feel as though everything is normal. I want to believe. 

I sit here at my study, still in my work clothes. As I share my experience, typing hastily, a notification blinks on the corner of my screen. It's Marsh.

""Hey Joe, Hope you're feeling better. You gave us quite a scare at work previously. Glad I could help you get home. Let me know if you need anything."" 

My chest tightens as I read his words. He brought me home?

I don't know what's real anymore. Can't collect my thoughts well, and I'm still trying to figure out what happened. I hear the discordant waltz from the song echo in my mind, though it's hard for me to fully recall what it sounded like, but impossible to forget.

It sure has hit me somewhere into my subconscious, unearthing something buried and raw.

Maybe when I give it a second listen, I'll finally understand. Maybe it'll help me piece together whatever it has awakened in me. 

Or maybe, it'll pull me deeper into the unknown and the vivid.

As of now, It's just a burning memory.",1,1733855878.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hb8mbp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hb8mbp,Need Help Making a “Modern” Apartment Feel Like Home,"I posted something similar over on r/roomdesign but figured I’d also share here for more of a “whole home” approach. If you want other photos and/or measurements, let me know!
 
I’m trying to “warm up” my apartment and running into some trouble coming up with ideas. We like a lot of the mid-century Millennial / eclectic styles incorporating a variety of colors, textures, and shapes. We like more natural, earthy tones and materials, but don’t mind something metal and shiny if it’s the right accent piece. We hate the “big light” and want to use lamps and other lighting to keep the space feeling warm and cozy. 

We’ve got a good start going, but we’d love some advice. We’re on a limited budget at the moment so we can’t ball out. We need to keep the couch (even though I feel it’s too big) and we can replace the bedframe *eventually*, but not any time soon. Specifically, we’re looking for the following: 

Living Room: We’d really like a rug and a coffee table in the living room. The little table we have doesn’t cut it, but we know we’re limited on space. For a rug, we don’t really have any ideas, so the world is your oyster on that one. The wall behind the couch could use some love, but we really don’t know what to put on it. Gallery wall? 3 large pieces? Pleaseee let us know your thoughts and ideas! We’d also love some more lighting ideas. Right now a lot of our warmth comes from our Christmas lights (Tis the season) but need some ideas once we pack all that up. 

Bedroom: First, we’ve already got some new, matching nightstands in mind. They’re a lighter wood with rattan cabinet. We’ve also picked out a lighter green for our sheets and are thinking of a light brown duvet instead of the grey Walmart special we have going on now. BUT, if you have other ideas we can change anything as nothing is purchased yet. We’d love your thoughts on lamps/lighting in the room (again, no big light) as well as wall art and decor. Any other thoughts or arrangement ideas are welcome, too!

Office: we’re pretty set here, but any ideas are welcome! We need some more wall art, but compared to the rest of the house, the office can wait. 

Bathroom(s): We feel good about both the guest and primary bathrooms, but would love your thoughts. We are specifically looking for a cute lamp for each as the big light is again a no-go (unless occupied as we leave the doors open to keep the whole apartment space feeling bigger), the mirror light is way too bright in the evenings (and a bit too cool in temperature, even at its “warmest” setting), but a candle is too dim. Also, any ideas are welcome here too. 

Kitchen: we’d love to put something on the island (peninsula?) to add some warmth and texture, especially with the white countertops and white walls and are looking for ideas. Also, the tree painting need not stay, but could also be moved elsewhere if you think of a good fit! We’d love ideas in general here. 

And that’s about it! We are renting, so I can’t necessarily paint or drill into the walls which could be limiting but we can make it work. We really appreciate your help, ideas, comments, roasts, any of it!",1,1733855520.0,HomeDecorating,3,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I need opinions,"My friend group is online, but we all hang out in person 2-4 times a year. I am new to this group (a friend introduced me), and I've only really been friends with this since early this year. There's a girl in this group, lets call her Ana. 

Ana and I don't really talk to each other much, but we have a normal, friendly relationship but it just doesn't extend past the group, i.e. we don't talk each other outside of a group setting. We've met each other 2 times before, and a few weeks ago when our group hung out again for a few days is when we met for the third time in person. This time was very different. She was around me, a lot. She kept touching me, which was very confusing. We all hung out for 2 days. At first I thought she was just being friendly (she doesn't know I am gay), but at certain point during the first day of us hanging out she grabbed me by the hips. At that moment I thought ""am I being sexually harassed"" lol.   
  
She was flirting with me, too. Throughout the whole time of us hanging out she kept being.. lets just say verbally playful with me. Like she sat down next to me during lunch and I was like ""oh hey, wanted to have some lunch?"" and she went ""I just wanted to sit next to you 😁"" which caught me 100% off guard and made me flustered as hell. Later that night we all went out to a bar, and we spent a lot of time together then, too. Right as we were leaving for it she wrapped her hand around my waist, and held me by my waist and walked out towards the bar like that. Later during the dinner we separated from the rest of the group and went home together (as in literally, I don't mean sex or anything like that). 

Later that night I was lying in my bed trying to process what the fuck all of that was and where did that come from, and I thought to myself ""well maybe its just one weird day"". Nope. Very next day first thing she does when she sees me in the morning is come up to me, touch my shoulder and stand right next to me. A bit later after lunch she comes up to me and asks if I have any plans for the evening. I say no, and ask her ""why, do you wanna do something together?"" Long story short we separated from the rest of the group and spent 4 hours walking Manhattan together, her wrapped around my arm, we feed each other oysters & ice cream (not like with a spoon, but from the same plate / bowl), drink each other's coffee and stuff. We kept the banter / flirting, too, nonstop.

At that point I had to leave to run some personal errands, but before I do she says ""if you want to I can get us some wine and when you come back we can go to your hotel room 😉"". I was SHOCKED when she said that. I nervously laughed and said ""yeah haha looooool"", which was immediately followed up by like 5 seconds of silence and me realizing she was NOT, in fact, joking. I went ""are you serious??????"" and she was like ""yeah!"". I told her that okay, she can do that. 

Now I want to say that I am a new person to this group, and I am really worried about causing any drama. This friend group also has some business together (hence the hotel), so I don't want to be causing any personal drama. I thought to myself ""am I making a mistake"" when I told her yes to the wine proposal. 

After I come back from my errands, I text her that she can come over. When she walks in, the first thing she does is go ""wow \[my name\], its so dim in here, are you trying to be romantic?"" I thought to myself ""wow gloves off I guess"" cause before that she didn't explicitly said if what we were doing was romantic. So we sit down, she opens the wine bottle, and I go ""I for sure thought you were straight"", to which she replies ""What do you mean? I am straight."" To say I was shocked is to say nothing. Like jaw on the floor levels of shocked. I ask her ""Are you fucking with me??? 😅"" and she says she wasn't. I didn't know what to say. I am fine with her being straight, I am not comfortable with all the touchiness in this setting. I ask her wtf all of that was, and she didn't know what to say cause it was normal to her, cause its normal in her culture apparently (she is chinese). I tell her I am a lesbian, and she had 0 reaction to that. I don't mean like ""straight person says they're chill with gay people"", I mean like ""thats normal to me"" level of reaction I only get from queer people. I don't get a sense of ""thats normal"" from straight people. I then tell her ""well if you were gay, you'd be popular with women"", to which she replies ""ah that makes me feel good 😁"" which was like uhhh okay didn't know what I was expecting to hear but not that probably. 

We spent 3 hours drinking wine together and talking until 1 am, after which she left. Right as she was leaving, she hugged me, which was unexpected because shortly prior to that she told me hugging is very intimate for her in her culture and she's uncomfortable with it. That was the last day we spent together, but the next day when we were both flying back home and she came over to see me again, at the airport. She was at a completely different terminal, and she was running late with only 10 minutes left to board, and yet she asked me where I was and came to see me one last time and hug me. 

Ever since then we've planned a 1:1 trip together through PNW. I asked her if she wanted to do it, and she gave me an immediate yes, which was unexpected. She seemed quite interested in it. 

I don't know what to make of any of this. I am happy with our relationship as it is, I get a lot of enjoyment out of our friendship, but I don't understand what was all of that flirting & touching all about since she said she's straight. FWIW I am taking this as ""she is straight"", but the problem is if this was someone else's story I would 100% say ""yeah I bet she's not straight"", so I cannot stop thinking about it. All of my friends that I've asked said that ""she might not be straight, but don't get hurt"". I also want to add that she laughs a lot at things that I say. Its very confusing to me, the only times in my life that women have acted like this around me was when they were romantically interested. 

I also want to add she's very mature and straight forward, and I can just ask her things, but unfortunately due to the nature of the friend group I cannot make things too uncomfortable without it affecting the business relationships inside the group. 

So... I don't know. What would you think of this situation if it happened to you? ",1,1733855312.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

I’m American and in the last several years have grown an affinity for Japanese food. I’ve learned how to make onigiri, gyoza, hanami & mitarashi dango, and Japanese soufflé cheesecake & pancakes from scratch. And I love love love matcha. 

But the one thing I haven’t been able to find in local Asian marts near me is NATTŌ. It’s been a dream of mine to try it for 2 years now and I finally found some at Mitsuwa. Honestly, I’ve heard the horror stories and I didn’t think I’d like it, but I DO. I’ve tried it in white rice with scallions and nori and on toast with butter and on toast with cheese. If anyone has any other suggestions, I’d love to hear it. I have to make another trip to buy more though 💔

Anyway, if you’re someone who’s been scared to try it, this is your sign to just DO IT. The smell is not pungent (smells mildly like coffee) and I don’t think it’s as slimy feeling as people make it out to be nor does the flavor taste too strong (I’d say savory but slightly bitter).

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe (native German speaker) seeking a meaningful relationship with someone who’s emotionally ready, clear about their intentions, and genuinely interested in building something real. Let me be upfront: I’m not here for casual chats or months of uncertainty. I’m looking for a partner—a true connection that goes deeper than surface-level small talk.

**A bit about me:**

* I’m tall (185 cm / 6’1”), curvy, and love diving into meaningful conversations that range from deep and thought-provoking to playful and witty.
* I’m a crime thriller audiobook enthusiast—though my detective skills need some work!
* I’m happiest when exploring the outdoors, hiking with my mischievous dog, or winding down with knitting and a good cup of coffee or tea.

Travel fuels my soul:
I’m especially drawn to northern regions and enjoy exploring cities, breathing in the sea air, and finding off-the-beaten-path adventures. While a beach day can be nice, I prefer a balance of relaxation and discovery.

**Here’s what I’m looking for in you:**

* Someone emotionally available, clear about their intentions, and genuinely seeking a real connection.
* Intelligence, wit, and the ability to carry a conversation that goes beyond “What’s your favorite color?”
* Effort and consistency in communication. If sporadic check-ins are your style, we’re probably not a match.

**A few more details about me:**

* I’ve never been married, don’t have kids, and I’m not looking to change that.
* Physical appearance isn’t as important to me as a sharp mind and a great sense of humor.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me about your passions, your favorite places to explore, or what you’re looking for in a partner. Let’s skip the ambiguity and see if we connect in a meaningful way.

Looking forward to hearing from someone who’s ready for something real!

So my spouse (47nb) met someone at a local poly get together and unfortunately, they immediately girlfriend-zoned her. I had gone out and met a guy I'd been talking with for coffee and the two of them were talking before I left and after I got back. It seemed like things were going well. 

On Sunday we went to a poly karaoke show, she came with her kids. They had a date scheduled for lunch on Wednesday. 

Last night after she had been busy all day (get togethers, children, etc) she had sent them a message on Facebook that with everything going on in her life she's not in a place for another relationship right now. 

Spouse is autistic and this triggered a meltdown and a crying jag. They were so excited about finally meeting someone local. All their other relationships (excepting one) were online and/or long distance. 

Instead of accepting that things don't always work out, the meltdown continued over social media on their Facebook page, sharing screenshots of their conversation with her, talking about how they're a fucking idiot to believe that anyone would ever care about them in the way they need (note - I've been with them since 2006 but because I have a long distance partner, this excludes me apparently), and not only did she block them on social media, she also went to the admins of the local poly group we were both in on Facebook and got them kicked out. 

(I don't blame her, they are a large person and very intimidating when upset. I know it's all bluster but she has only known them for a few days and that's a valid concern.)

I guess I'm just frustrated by all of this. They keep asking me if I messaged her or it I went into the poly group to advocate for them. My reply is no, because there's no reason for me to interfere in a ""relationship"" that I'm not part of, and honestly, I need the friendship and support I'm getting from the poly community via the group. 

Any advice or recommendations? I'm mentally exhausted by this whole situation, to be honest. ",21,1733855066.0,polyamory,29,1.0,False

I just joined the group and have finally found my people. 

I am a single mom and two boys, 2 & 5 and lately I feel like I am experiencing true burnout. 

Monday through Friday looks like this every day:

-5am-630am: Get myself and kids ready. Pack lunches. 
-630am-700am: Drive and drop off at daycare. 
-700am-730am:  Drive to work 
-730am-400pm: Work 
-400pm-500pm Drive home from work, pick up kids. 
-5pm-6pm: Wash hands, unpack backpacks, change into pjs, start a load of laundry, cook QUICK dinner. 
-6-630pm: Eat dinner 
-630pm-700: clean up kitchen from dinner, unload dishwasher, reload dishwasher. 
-7pm-730: flex time to scroll my phone, have dessert with the kiddos, or do one-off chores
-730pm-800pm: bedtime routine-brush teeth, read book and lights out at 8pm. 
-8pm-830/9pm- lay down with kiddos until they fall asleep
-830/9pm-10pm: Drink tea and read my book/ watch tv (I have to take medication nightly and drinking tea is the easiest way to ingest it otherwise I would go straight to bed)
 
I feel like I am doing the bare minimum and I am so exhausted. 
One small hiccup in our nighttime routine and the boys go to bed late and they are so much harder to wake up in the morning and it has a domino effect on the whole day.
If I don't do the dishes for one night, they are piling up over the sink. 
I have not gotten more than 6.5 hours of sleep during the week for I don't even know how long. 

I take a variety of supplements to help me get through the days-nothing crazy just B vitamins and herbal stuff. And coffee obviously. 

So what do you think? Do you guys see anywhere I can cut corners? I am so tired. Or do I just need to suck it up and accept that this is my life now?",2,1733854650.0,workingmoms,5,1.0,False

In any case, let me share my story.

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his nerdy quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring relationship with.

So if you're a fellow lover of coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? So I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me
An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into business and investments, frustrated law student, can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck (sarcasm towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no relationship (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha).

- I'm 5'10"", physically fit, resides in quezon city. I would say that I'm not that much attractive but would consider myself very hygienic and decent.

- I'm an INTJ, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in horoscope.

- Loves to read self-help books as I love to learn and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:

Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People

##Pros:

- Responsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism.

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts responsibility for one's own actions and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- Doesn’t play online and computer games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

There's Hope Fam!,"TLDR: Needed to eat KETO/AIP (plus an incidental round of amoxicillin) to eliminate the SIBO, but was not able to actually resolve symptoms until eliminating gluten from my diet. After avoiding gluten I was able to have some flexibility in what I ate and could even drink coffee again. Cutting out gluten entirely has allowed my leaky gut to heal. The key really is starting with AIP and finding the culprit first. I highly recommend keto if you are suspecting SIBO as well. Once you find the culprit, the reintroductions become a lot easier.

This might have been the darkest chapter of my life, but I'm grateful to be improving and hope for everyone to be able to do the same.

To clarify, I still don't know what's wrong with me or what happened, I have theories but still don't know. I've had several rounds of blood tests (blood work was always good) and had MRIs on my head and chest (2 small and I'm told benign findings on spleen and liver) but I was told that everything looks fine. Endoscopy/colonoscopy also came back normal.

Timeline is important, at least a year ago I started noticing ringing in my left ear that would randomly intensify. Not long after I started to notice a light brain fog which I had been attributing to my weed use. 

From 12 months to 6 months ago, things got BAD. I went from mildly impaired to severe brain fog, major histamine issues when eating foods, explosive ringing in my left ear with a headache that would radiate into my head, fatigue, apathy, melancholy, and major anxiety. I just wanted to detach from reality and sleep at this point.

About 6 months ago, I felt swelling and tightness in my chest near my liver/pancreas/gallbladder. I started having blood tests done by my PCP which didn't result in anything meaningful except finding an elevated pancreatic enzyme. It was suggested I had GERD and was prescribed a PPI (which actually made things worse IMO). A referral for an MRI was denied by my insurance (thank god we get to pay for a service that doesn't give a shit about our actual health, right?!). I also had an appointment with a GI for 3 months out (hurray for the expensive US medical system!). I felt lost and completely ignored by our insanely expensive US medical circus.

At this point I went for my first ER visit. Got an MRI of my chest which revealed the 2 small lesions but nothing conclusive or anything actionable. I was again diagnosed with GERD, told to keep using the PPI, and sent on my way.

From 6 months to 5 months ago, I checked myself into another ER due to explosive ear ringing and head pain. Had an MRI done on my head which came back clean. What was interesting though is that they intravenously gave me an anti-inflammatory, an antihistamine, and a steroid and my symptoms almost completely vanished. First big clue that I was looking at this all the wrong way.

After those ER visits and thousands of dollars later (fuck US healthcare), I realized I needed to figure it out myself, I started to google symptoms and look for any correlation with others' experiences... which led me to r/AutoImmuneProtocol. Finally, I was seeing that there are others dealing with similar issues and there is a way to control symptoms.

So, this sub led me to Paleo Mom and I leaned hard into the AIP. After 3 days of the diet, I noticed a difference, not a huge improvement, but enough to give me hope that I could get through whatever was going on. I also started tracking foods that my body would respond negatively to.

* Dietary observations 
   * Foods high in glucose, nuts, legumes, and even coconut triggered mast cell activation and caused a major histamine response
   * Grains were a big trigger
   * I also couldn't drink coffee, enjoy any dairy, eat processed food, or have anything with artificial ingredients (no coffee was probably the hardest thing for me)
   * Couldn't even really have vegetables without having a flareup (with the exception of broccoli which was fine)
   * It genuinely seemed like the only things my body was willing to process was meat, animal fat, broccoli, and water
   * I also could not take anything high in fiber or probiotics as these exacerbated the SIBO and leaked more bacteria into my body.

Thankfully, I've always been a carnivore so eating almost exclusively meat and broccoli wasn't total misery. I missed coffee and diet soda a lot though, a sweet tooth sucks when it seems to be killing you. My speculation at this point is that keto was resolving the SIBO (albeit slowly), but the PPI was slowing the improvement.

After a month of eating this way things had improved a lot, I was back to maybe 90% normal.

Also worth mentioning is toward the end of this period I had stopped taking the PPI which I believe was encouraging bacterial growth. Also, I had gotten sick and was prescribed amoxicillin (praise be). I had a significant Herxheimer response (bacterial die off) and believe I was able to kill off the SIBO. I believe this was a turning point for my healing.

From 5 months to 4 months ago, I was able to get a sooner appointment to see the GI. Told him I found blood in my stool (I had a test which showed there was occult blood present) and had an endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled. What sucked was I had been eating keto AIP for at least a month and by the time the doctor took a look everything appeared normal... but at least I could rule out a malignancy for the most part. Diet seemed to be having a significant positive impact, so I felt I was on the right track. 

From 4 months to now, it's wild how much an arbitrarily assigned value like an 8% improvement can seem but I feel like I'm almost back to normal and have hope I'll get back all the way. What really made the difference is noticing what impacted my leaky gut the most during reintroductions.

There's a critical difference in the effects of different foods.

* If I ate gluten, my bowels would feel sore and raw: if leaky gut is a deterioration of the intestinal lining which allows ""stuff"" into the blood stream that doesn't belong there then wheat is my biggest trigger and the obvious culprit
* If I ate gluten, then anything else I ate would trigger autoimmune responses and major histamine responses (if I avoid gluten entirely, I can drink coffee and eat almost normally, but if I have gluten the autoimmune responses come back)
* Before finding that gluten is the prime culprit, all the other foods I mentioned above caused mast cell activation/a major histamine response and swollen lymph nodes. They did not seem to cause that sore/raw feeling in my intestine though
* I still feel best when my diet is ketogenic, but it doesn't seem to be a requirement as long as I avoid gluten

The brain fog is almost completely gone with the exception of some flare ups, I'm still dealing with histamine flare ups, but not anywhere near the same severity, this also seems to improve rapidly if I avoid gluten entirely. The ear ringing is also much more manageable and improving.

I hope this helps someone out there who is trying to get out of the hole that life can sometimes put us in. The key really is starting with AIP and finding the culprit first. I highly recommend keto if you are suspecting SIBO as well. Once you find the culprit, the reintroductions become a lot easier.",11,1733854451.0,AutoImmuneProtocol,8,0.93,False
