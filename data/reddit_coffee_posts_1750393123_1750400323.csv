My kiddo is turning 4 soon, and we've hit a parenting milestone I was not emotionally prepared for: he’s aging out of his beloved morning vitamin gummy (for ages 1–3). It's been part of our sacred morning ritual — you know, like coffee for adults but way more colorful and shaped like a bear.

He eats well, loves fruits and veggies (which feels like I’ve already won the toddler lottery), but he expects his “healthy candy” every morning like clockwork. And honestly, it’s become a nice little routine for both of us.

So, I’m on the hunt for a multivitamin gummy for 4-year-olds that:

1. Is sugar-free or low sugar (I still have dental bills from my own childhood traumas)

2. Doesn’t taste like disappointment

3. Preferably has a cool shape or character so I can maintain the illusion of morning magic


Bonus points if you have funny stories of vitamin negotiations with your tiny human. Because you and I both know... this is serious business.

Thanks, vitamin warriors of the dadverse!

I recently moved to Kathmandu and, like many adults navigating life after college, I’ve found that making meaningful friendships is *way harder* than it used to be. Back in school or college/ university, friendships formed naturally— shared benches, group projects, random corridor chats. debates. Now, with the 9-5 grind, endless deadlines, and social batteries constantly running low, it feels almost impossible.

I’m not looking for dating hookups or short-term flings. I’m looking to build a community *circle*—a space for like-minded individuals (working professionals or students) who crave connection, good conversations, a bit of fun, and most importantly, long-term friendships.

Imagine this:

* Casual meetups in cozy cafes/ chiya addas ☕
* Walks in parks or visits to hidden gems in the city 🌆
* Small get-togethers or game nights 🎲
* Maybe a spontaneous short trip when the stars align 🌄

No pressure, no pretenses—just mature people looking to unwind, share experiences, and grow a circle that doesn’t revolve around apps or algorithms.

If this resonates with you, drop a comment or DM me! Let’s build something genuinely fulfilling, even if it starts with a small cup of coffee.",1,1750400059.0,NepalSocial,2,1.0,False

Not having to look forward to anything, and knowing very well that it will be a waste like all the other days, somehow worsens my sleep paralysis and doesn't let me get off the bed but keeps my brain fully awake. I'd kill for at least one well rested, care free sleep something I don't think I have experienced ever since i became a literal teen.

And of course opening up your phone, the first thing in the morning, doesn't help either. It just overstimulates me completely leaving me even more dysfunctional and dizzy than before and the annoying family doesn't get out of the kitchen after 10 and I don't want to see their faces in the morning and ruin the day even more but then i can't make myself some coffee either.

So here’s the **unofficial** roast of each barangay in Mandaluyong ☺️

**1. Addition Hills**
Y’all got “Addition” in the name, but all that’s been added is traffic and construction noise. It’s giving *never-ending renovation energy.*

**2. Bagong Silang**
""Bagong Silang"" means ""newborn"" but baby, y’all been around since forever. It's time to update your baby pics and get that glow-up.

**3. Barangka Drive**
The shortcut that’s never short. If Barangka Drive had a tagline, it would be: *“You thought it was faster? Think again.”*

**4. Barangka Ibaba**
Living here is like living in a hidden level of an RPG — only locals know where to go and how to survive.

**5. Barangka Ilaya**
The highland sibling who thinks they’re better than Barangka Ibaba. Girl, you’re both stuck with the same tricycle fare hike.

**6. Barangka Itaas**
So many Barangkas, it’s giving *Barangka Cinematic Universe.* And you, Itaas, are the final boss — the one with no parking.

**7. Buayang Bato**
Named after a *stone crocodile* — which makes sense, ‘cause every pothole here is a trap waiting to snatch your tire and your will to live.

**8. Burol**
So quiet, you’d think it’s a ghost town — but plot twist: the drama in the sari-sari store is louder than EDSA at 5PM.

**9. Daang Bakal**
Literal translation: *Iron Road.* Which is accurate, ‘cause that road will rattle your bones like you owe it money.

**10. Hagdang Bato Itaas**
Taas nga, but why does the climb feel like you're training for *Ninja Warrior Philippines*? Your cardio better be ready.

**11. Hagdang Bato Libis**
The lowland sibling who swears they’re chill — but give it one rain and boom! Instant swimming pool.

**12. Harapin ang Bukas**
Iconic name. But baby, how can we face the future if the internet signal can't even face one Zoom call?

**13. Highway Hills**
It's giving condo-core and coffee shops that charge P300 for *air*. Congrats though, you gentrified successfully.

**14. Hulo**
Y’all are always on the edge — geographically *and* emotionally. It’s like “Welcome to Hulo... now prepare for detour.”

**15. Mabini–J.Rizal**
Two national heroes, one barangay. Too bad your sidewalk feels like a battlefield. #PatrioticallyPotholey

**16. Malamig**
Says “cold” in the name, but the chismis here is hotter than a 2PM MRT ride in April.

**17. Mauway**
So underrated, even Grab drivers say, *“Ma’am, saan po 'yan ulit?”* Mauway, you're the Mandaluyong version of *“She’s mysterious.”*

**18. Namayan**
Sounds regal, but one wrong turn and you’re suddenly in a maze with five dogs, two sari-sari stores, and a man playing tong-its.

**19. New Zañiga**
We get it, you're *new* — but you're also the quiet achiever. Just vibing, low-key, and always has the best kwek-kwek.

**20. Old Zañiga**
You’re the ate who never left home but still throws the best fiesta. We see you, classic queen.

**21. Pag-Asa**
Named “Hope” — which is exactly what you need when you’re stuck in traffic from EDSA crossing.

**22. Plainview**
The only thing plain here is the *view* from your 4th tricycle transfer. But hey, you’ve got Wack-Wack as a neighbor — now that’s aspirational.

**23. Pleasant Hills**
Girl, your hills are pleasant until it rains. Then it's “Welcome to Slip n’ Slide: Mandaluyong Edition.”

**24. Poblacion**
The OG. The mothership. The barangay equivalent of *“I walked so y’all could run.”* Respect the lola.

**25. San Jose**
You might be low-key, but that karinderya near the corner? Changed my life. Healing era starts here.

**26. Vergara**
Everyone forgets you exist — until they need a shortcut to Makati. You're the silent MVP.

**27. Wack-Wack Greenhills**

We’re thinking of staying 9 nights in Thun and 7 nights in Grindelwald. We can be flexible with the number of nights in each place, but we must stay only in those two locations. We’ll be using the Swiss Travel Pass Flex (15 days in 1 month), and since my parents are older, I tried to make the itinerary as relaxed as possible to avoid exhaustion. However, I’m not sure if I’ve planned things efficiently. We’re planning to visit only three places that aren’t fully covered by the pass but are discounted: First, Männlichen, and Gornergrat (via Zermatt). If you take a look at the itinerary below, I’d really appreciate any feedback—especially suggestions for the day I marked as “not sure what to do yet” (Day 11), preferably something scenic and fully covered by the Swiss Travel Pass. As you can see, we’re not even using all 15 travel days on the Swiss Travel Pass Flex. That said, it still seems worth it compared to the 8-day option. If anyone has suggestions for places we could visit using more of the travel days *without overexerting my parents*, that would be super helpful. Ideally, somewhere scenic and easily accessible by public transport. Just to note—we’re not really interested in museums unless it’s a truly iconic one, so we’re mostly focusing on nature, light walking, and beautiful views.  Also, if you notice any inefficient parts or have tips on how to improve the flow, I’d love to hear them. Thanks again for any input!

I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.

""Fine, but I want the full story.""

""You will get it, I swear."" I nodded back to the road. ""Now focus on driving so you don't ruin us."" I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane.

""Heck!"" Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. ""I just worry about you, pup."" I couldn't stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

""I know you do."" I settled back into my seat and sighed. ""I promise, what happened isn't going to make that feeling any better."" I wiped at my face. ""I don't even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.""

""Well, let's hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar."" My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time.

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. ""Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours."" My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

""Work?""

""Work."" He nodded.

""This summer, can you teach me some stuff?"" A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself away from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

""Of course, Sugar."" My uncle smiled up at me. ""You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were open to it.""

""I asked to move to your pack."" I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

""What is going on?"" His eyes flashed.

""I'll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.""

""Of course, Sugar."" He smiled and then turned back to the laptop on his lap. ""Now get some sleep.""

""Will do."" I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. ""We are here.""

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. ""Okay."" I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. ""Thank you.""

""No problem, Princess."" The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

""You don't have to call me Princess.""

""You are the Alpha's daughter."" She bowed and then left us to our own devices.

""Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing."" Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. ""You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.""

""I know. But Alpha Dan won't allow me to leave..."" I looked over and blew out a breath. ""I think he assumes something I am running from and won't let me leave until he knows for sure.""

""You going to tell me yet, Sugar.""

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

""Dad.""

""Hey my pup."" His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

""I've missed you."" I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

""As I have missed you."" He kissed my temple. ""Now we have much to discuss."" He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind.

""Slow down, jack ass. Some of us can't move that fast."" Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father's office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

""Tell me what's wrong, pup."" I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. ""Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.""

""Agreed Sugar.""

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said.

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.

Chapter Five

""I lived another life, and I died."" I stumbled over my words and I felt my father freeze. A quick look to Ronnie had him locking the door and waving his hands. I felt the air still, but I was focused on my father's eyes. ""This morning I woke up six years in the past after living until I was twenty-four, and growing my own pup only to have my mate to rip him from my body.""

My father's and Ronnie's snarl shook the walls, but I raised my hands. ""He betrays me for my step sister who convinced him that I cheated and the pup wasn't his, so he brought death to us both using silver scalpels, and burying any love I had for him at the same time."" I looked up at my father and the tears rolled down my face.

""Pup."" His voice was choked up, but I raised my hand.

""I don't want him to be my mate, daddy. I know I won't survive it. I need to change it. Everything, and it starts with hiding my scent. I told mom what I needed, and she called you. How are you going to help me?"" I was starting to panic. ""I don't want to die. I don't want my pup ripped from my stomach only for him to smell himself on him. I don't want to create life just to have it ripped from me daddy. I can't."" My soul was ripping and even though I want revenge, this was the first time I was given to truly grieve the lost of my pup.

""Sugar."" Ronnie's voice was barely a whisper and then I felt my father lose control.

""Who?"" His voice was pure darkness. His fist slammed into the desk, creaking the thick wood, and I looked up to find my father's wolf looking back at me. ""Who hurt you, my pup? Who did those my grand pup?"" Loki's voice was deeper than I had ever heard and his eyes promised retribution.

""Brandon, the alpha's son."" I whispered the final piece and everything seemed to click. The air rushed back in and my father's wolf shifted into his black form. I screamed and Ronnie dove in front of the door.

Loki snarled, but Ronnie held firm. ""You can't go for him for something that hasn't come to pass yet, Loki. You know how this works. You have been through it yourself."" But Loki just snarled.

""Daddy, please."" I begged. I knew if he got out, Brandon and Shannon were dead and the council would be on his doorstop. Loki whirled on me and softened at the devastation he saw on my face. He padded over and licked the tears from my face before going back behind the desk and shifting again.

""I'm sorry Amy, I lost myself for a moment."" He opened a door and slipped into some shorts. He wiped at his face before he sat back down. ""I guess its our turn to come clean.""

""Daddy?"" I sniffled and looked up at him.

""I'm not just a wolf, although, as you can see, Loki is very much a part of me."" His laughter was weak, but I just smiled. ""My mother was a shaman of our people, a witch, and my father had to have her. Even if it was just for a night. And I was born.""

""A witch?"" I dropped my hands, and he just had a small, sad smile.

""Yeah. You would have loved her, but witches don't live like us. They have the lifespan of a human, a flash in the pan. She was gone long before I met your mother."" He shook his head. ""One of her powers was exactly what you explained, a second chance. The moon goddess passed us down with the same powers. I had mine when I was your age as well.""

I jolted back as he nodded. ""What?""

""I never cheated on your mother."" His words were soft. ""I alpha commanded a wolf to pretend I did when she came to me and told me she was with pup. You see, in my first life, I stayed with her and we had three wonderful pups, but one night, my enemies attacked and the four of your were all murdered."" His swallow was thick.

""Daddy.""

""I couldn't lose you, not all of my pups, so when I woke up four years in the past, I acted. You were just a babe. I never got your brothers or sister, which broke me for a time. But I had you."" He swallowed back his tears as I reached his side. ""I told your mother I betrayed her.""

""She said she felt it.""

He nodded slowly. ""When a wolf betrays their marked mate, the mate feels the worse pain imaginable.""

""Yes, he does."" Ronnie growled out and I darted my eyes back to his face and I realized something.

""Mom and Morgan.""

""It doesn't happen often enough to make it a big."" My dad growled out.

""But it happens enough that you feel the pain."" Ronnie growled out.

""Mom doesn't know."" I wrapped my arms around my father. ""She wouldn't ever if she knew.""

""I know, princess, but you can't tell her. I'm sure I passed the fate, since I made it past my death...but now, now it would break her to find out the truth."" My dad squeezed me.

""So she felt you take another female?"" I hugged him back, but he just shook his head.

""I used my power to fake the pain. She was crying inside of our room, and I was in the next room, breaking my own heart.""

""Daddy?""

""It was losing her and you, or losing everything. And I knew I would still get to see my little girl."" My dad pulled back. ""But anyway, I didn't tell you so you would feel bad for me, but to know that you have power too. Power to hide your scent, at the very least. But I will teach you how to wield it this summer.""

""Thank you, dad.""

""Don't thank me yet. This summer will probably be the worst you have ever had, but it will save you in the long run.""

""Once everything is done, I need you to promise me something, daddy.""

""What is it, pumpkin?"" My dad always called me new nicknames when he was worried.

""After I have done what I need to do, we are going to tell mom the truth.""

""Baby, we can't.""

""She is stronger than you think. And she never moved on. She only got with Morgan because she thought I needed a male's protection in the new pack. And she didn't like the attention she was getting from the Alpha.""

My dad growled and hit his desk again and then nodded. ""Fine. We will tell her.""

""Thank you, daddy."" I kissed his cheek.

""Now go get settled, we will start tomorrow morning, but I know a certain someone who is pounding down the pack house doors to try to see you.""

I smiled and shook my head. Cass was my best friend and soul sister. ""Cass?""

""Has been champing at the bit as soon as she heard you were coming, so go see her.""

""I love you two.""

""And we love you, sugar."" Ronnie kissed my head. ""I'd ruin your alpha mate if I could.""

""You would start a war."" I shook my head and left with a last hug from my dad.

Chapter Six

I walked to my room and screamed when I was tackled to the ground. I started laughing as Cassie got off me. ""Why the heck didn't you tell me you were coming?"" She punched my shoulder as I stood.

""I didn't know until this morning."" I hugged her to my side. ""I missed you.""

""I missed you too."" She pulled back and tossed me a small box. ""Happy birthday.""

I laughed again. ""With everything that has happened, I had pretty much forgotten that it's my birthday today.""

""The big eighteen. Have you shifted yet?"" Cassie jumped up and down with excitement.

I just shook my head. ""I don't shift. You know that."" My face fell. I heard chuffing inside of my head.

""I think you are just blocking it. You have a wolf. We all feel her."" She bumped her hip into mine. ""I can feel she wants out."" My wolf chuffed in agreement.

Cassie is smarter than you. My wolf's voice ricochetted in my mind and I just smiled. There are things I cannot tell you, even now, but eventually, if we are lucky, you will find out your answers.

I rolled my eyes. Yet another non answer from Nix, my wolf. She snorted back to me and then receded into the back of my mind.

""Nix still not answering you?""

""She is, but it's more of her non answers."" I grabbed my bag and opened it up. ""You will never guess what happened today.""

Cassie flopped on my bed. ""Tell me everything.""

I opened my mouth to tell her I lived before and my father's voice sounded in my mind. Baby girl, I know you might want to tell Cassie what happened with your first life, and I understand the need, but don't tell anyone yet. You can't seal their tongue and our heritage is dangerous.

Okay, dad. I won't.

I love you. Then his voice was gone and I had to reorganize my thoughts.

""Tell me."" Cassie threw a pillow at me and I shook my head.

""I think the alpha's son is my mate, and so does Shannon. She lost her ever loving mind, and was stealing my clothes so that he would pay attention to her."" I shook my head in disgust.

""She was trying to steal your mate?"" Cassie's eyes flashed.

""She can have him. I don't want or need her sloppy seconds. Even if she hadn't already did with him, which I am sure she has, I wouldn't have wanted him. He is mean and vindictive. And just...small.""

""Like small, small?"" Cassie held her finger and thumb close together and I bent over laughing, tears springing to my eyes as she joined in.

""I have no idea."" I wiped my eyes after I calmed down. ""Nor do I want to. I just mean even as an alpha, he gives off small man energy? I don't even know how to explain it exactly. Just that even when he is pushing his alpha aura, I feel nothing, not even a little bit, not even a fraction of what my dad does.""

I sat down on my bed. ""And you don't want to be with a mate that is weaker than you?""

""No, it's not that."" I shook my head. I wasn't explaining it right. ""I know that if given an excuse, he would betray me. His devotion would be weak, just like his aura.""

""Ah. Now I understand."" Cassie rolled on to her back and huffed. ""That would be the absolute worst thing. I don't know how your dad is taking the pain."" She took her eyes to me and grimaced.

""Did everyone here know the truth?""

Cassie shook her head. ""No, but once you guys left, and the Alpha never stayed with the she-wolf. With any she-wolf, we figured something was wrong, and then the wolf was born and we could all smell the girl's mate on the pup, and we knew they lied. We just don't know why."" Cassie rolled over. ""Do you know?""

I nodded. ""My dad told me the truth today when I told him I wanted to reject my mate.""

""Well, this is just depressing. Let's go out and do something?"" Cassie sat up and I just shook my head. ""C'mon.""

""I have training in the morning and my dad said it was going to be brutal.""

""So you can't go out today? Bull. Get up. We are going shopping and then I will parade you in front of everyone to make them jealous that my best friend is the Alpha's daughter.""

I perked up. ""Has anyone been giving you issues here?"" Cassie shook her head, but I could see someone had. ""Cass?""

She huffed and then nodded a little. ""Just a few she-wolves that think their sweat doesn't stink and have a higher rank."" Amanda and her little posse, I could only assume.

""Do they give you a lot of trouble?""

From making grocery list to making a planned weight loss plan like are you kidding me??? 

The other day I was chilling with my younger cousin we have a age gap of 10 years we were catching up on coffee he wanted some career advice and during that conversation I realised how things were different in my time, apply for job used to be so stressful and time consuming now literally with the help of AI it just take couple minutes to apply for a new job WITH THE COVER LETTER!!!! 
Wild isn't it.

He told me about several Ai tools that he uses regularly for applying for jobs like he uses ChatGPT and Quillbot for writing cover letter and of course humanising it and then he introduced me to this chrome extension called Applyonion that he uses to filter out companies who are hiring according to his visa requirements and he also showed the portal they have a portal for interview preparation as well that he uses.

I was so freaked out at this point that he had to prove it to me by applying to a random job under 15 freaking minutes!!!

1lfwjwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lfwjwj/that_morning/,That morning,"Been wanting to get this off my chest. Here it goes.  It’s been almost two years, and I still can’t shake that morning. We were in out of town for our cousin’s wedding.  morning after the wedding, hubby and I decided to grab coffee from a little neighborhood spot. Just coffee for us and the rest of the tired, hungover crew back at the Airbnb. My youngest child (1.5) was still asleep, and the oldest (3) was awake. I asked her to stay behind with all the cousins— I wanted a quiet moment with hubby.  Just the two of us. But as we were walking out the door, she said, “I wanna go too.” So, we said yes. Got to coffee shop. Sat down and took some photos. We got our drinks. Two trays full of hot coffee. Buckled up the toddler into her seat behind the driver’s side. Tightened her strap, like we always do — snug, but not too tight. I placed the drinks on the floor and glanced down at my phone. Hubby started to drive out the parking lot and waited at the red light. 

And then — it all happened at once.

A sudden jolt. My seatbelt yanked me back. A blur of movement. A car flew through the intersection, barely missing us. It was going at least 45 mph. No braking. No hesitation. Just recklessness. Our light was green. It had been green for several seconds. Hubby had started to go. I remember in my head thinking, “Okay, go now.” If he hadn’t tapped the brakes… if he hadn’t hesitated for just that split second…. We would’ve been hit. Hard. T-boned, on the driver’s side. Right where my toddler was sitting. I reached back instantly — grabbed her little hand, just to feel her, to make sure she was there, safe, real. I couldn’t breathe. My mind raced with all the things that could’ve happened. What if we’d spun? What if we didn’t make it? Would I have been burned? Would she have survived? And all I could think was — Why did I bring her? Why did I put her in that seat? Why did I want coffee that badly?

The hubs said afterward, “I don’t think I would’ve survived that hit.” And I believed him. I wanted to scream. I wanted to grab that driver and make them understand the life they nearly stole — the family they could’ve destroyed in one careless moment.
My family. That moment lives in my chest now. Still sharp. Still raw. And I don’t know if it will ever completely go away. Life is fragile. Beautiful and brutal in the same breath. You don’t always get a warning. Sometimes, all that separates a normal day from devastation is one small pause. One foot on the brake. If you’re still reading, thank you.
Thank you for holding space for this memory.
Thank you to our family for watching the kids that weekend. And thank you — whoever is watching over us —for the grace that kept us here.
Another chance. Another morning. Another breath. ",1,1750399236.0,Vent,4,1.0,False

After her rebirth, Elowen Hartley found herself back at 27, with two children and married to the world's richest man, Alaric Whitmore,the guy who'd been sitting pretty at the top of Forbes for years, crowned by Time Magazine as ""The #1 Man Every Woman Wants to Marry,"" and hell, even the British Royal Family wanted to hook him up with their princess.  
  
Everyone kept telling her how damn lucky she was. But the first thing she did after reborn was grabbed a divorce agreement and went straight to find his first love.  
  
She slid the papers across to Rosalind Avery, her voice flatly""I want a divorce. Alaric's yours,the kids too.""  
  
Rosalind stared at her in shock, like she couldn't believe the woman who'd been Mrs. Whitmore for six years would just give that position voluntarily.  
  
Elowen just shrugged, adding casually""Well,since they all like you better anyway, I'm doing you a favor. Just get Alaric to sign this, and once the cooling-off period's over, I will leave.""  
  
This time,she wasn't gonna make the same mistakes, wasn't gonna keep being the Mrs. Whitmore everyone ignored.  
  
Rosalind's fingers traced the rim of her coffee cup, brow furrowed deep. ""Elowen, what the hell are you playing at?""  
  
Elowen met those calculating eyes, her voice steady""I'm not playing anything. I'm just enough.""  
  
""Do you have any idea how many women are dying be Mrs.Whitmore?""  
  
""Yeah."" Elowen looked her straight in the eye. ""So congratulations,I gave it to you.""  
  
Something finally flickered across Rosalind's face for the first time.  
  
She stared at the agreement for what felt like forever, then finally snatched it up""Fine. If you're being this generous, I won't say no.""  
  
""But remember this—once something I got it, I never let it go.""  
  
""Don't worry,"" Elowen smiled,""I would never changing my mind.""  
  
After all, she'd already lived through a lifetime of misery in the past life.  
  
Rosalind moved to another table, then pulled out her phone and gave a call.  
  
When the call connected, her voice turned honey-sweet""Alaric? I'm at Bluze Café... could you pick me up?""  
  
Elowen sat to the side, a bitter smile playing at her lips.  
  
In the past she called Alaric,nine times out of ten, it would be answered by his assistant.  
  
And now, in less than twenty minutes, the man who was perpetually ""in a meeting"" had appeared at the café entrance.  
  
Through the glass window, Elowen watched Alaric stride into the café with his long legs, his black custom-tailored suit emphasizing his broad shoulders and narrow waist.  
  
Six-year-old Jude and four-year-old Elise practically threw themselves at Rosalind, all hugs and kisses.  
  
""Aunt Rosalind!"" Elise called out sweetly, nuzzling her little face against Rosalind's embrace.  
  
Alaric placed the cake box on the table and slid it across with his long fingers. ""Matcha flavor, just you favourite. I specifically asked the chef to go easy on the sugar.""  
  
Rosalind's eyes lit up""You're so thoughtful.""  
  
Elowen sat in her corner, nails digging into her palms.  
  
Yeah,six years of marriage, and Alaric didn't even know her favourite taste.  
  
In her past life, when she was hospitalized and craving strawberry cake, he had his assistant buy whatever one,finally,it was mango flavor, which she was allergic to.  
  
""What do you want for dinner?"" Alaric's voice was low, intimate. ""French or Italian food?""  
  
Rosalind smiled, pulling out the divorce papers from her purse""There’s something I hope you take a look before that.""  
  
She flipped to the signature page. ""I wanted this villa, but I'm a bit short on money... could you maybe—""  
  
Alaric took the pen and signed without even glancing at the content""Baby,why does it have to be so clear between us?""  
  
""Is Aunt Rosalind buying a new house?"" Jude piped up, looking hopeful. ""Dad, you should get one next door! Elise and I wanna move in with Aunt Rosalind,don't wanna live with Mom anymore.""  
  
Alaric frowned slightly, but seeing those eager sights, he caved""Alright,then lets get one.""  
  
""Oh, that's not necessary,"" Rosalind said quickly. ""I'll keep three rooms ready—for Jude, Elise... and [you.You](http://you.You) can stay here anytime you miss me.""  
  
The kids cheered, and Elise threw her arms around Rosalind's neck, planting a kiss on her cheek""Aunt Rosalind's the best!""  
  
Elowen's heart felt like it was being crushed by an invisible fist, so tight she could barely breathe.  
  
She watched Alaric's mouth curve into that soft smile,the one he'd never given her.  
  
Couldn't take it anymore. She grabbed her purse and bolted.  
  
The moment she stepped outside, memories from her past life crashed over her like a fucking tsunami.  
  
In her past life, she'd married Alaric in a business marriage, had a boy and a girl,and lived until 62 years old, but never felt happy.  
  
All because Alaric's heart always belonged to his first love, Rosalind Avery.  
  
Years ago when they broke up, Rosalind went abroad, and Alaric drowned himself in alcohol for a few days. But proud as he was, he ultimately never lowered himself to win her back, instead agreeing to his family's arranged marriage.  
  
Alaric had been her teenage dream - noble as a deity. Which socialite in the high society didn't dream of marrying the heir to the Ashford empire?  
  
So when she learned of the impending marriage alliance between their families, she was overjoyed.  
  
After marriage, she poured everything into loving him, what exchanged was Alaric's perpetual distance and coldness.  
  
Until Rosalind returned LA.  
  
He never mentioned divorce to Elowen, yet his eyes never left Rosalind.  
  
What was worse, both children loved Rosalind and growing more distant from her.  
  
In her later years, Elowen was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and Alaric abandoned her alone in the old mansion under the pretense of ""quiet recuperation.""  
  
On her birthday, she tremblingly called her husband and children, only to learn they were vacationing in Germany with Rosalind.  
  
She wanted to cook herself a birthday dinner for her birthday, but in her confused state forgot to turn off the stove...  
  
As the flames consumed her, Elowen's final memory was of Alaric's cold eyes when he had placed the wedding ring on her finger.  
  
She closed her eyes in agony, her only wish being that if there was a next life, she would never again sacrifice her entire existence for him.  
  
When Elowen returned to the villa, it was already late.  
  
But she didn't rest, instead going straight to clearing out belongings.  
  
Alaric's suits and shirts, the children's toys, family photos... one by one she threw everything into cardboard boxes.  
  
""What the hell are you doing?"" Alaric's voice cut through the silence behind her.  
  
Elowen turned to see him in the doorway, holding both kids' hands, his brow furrowed deep.  
  
""Why is Mommy throwing away our stuff!"" Elise ran over, seeing her toy in a box, her face red with rage.  
  
Jude glared at her too""We just went to play with Aunt Rosalind for a bit. You gonna throw a tantrum over that?""  
  
Alaric looked at her with those same ice-cold eyes""The kids like spending time with Rosalind. You really gonna make a scene over something this small?""  
  
""I'm not making a scene,"" Elowen said quietly.  
  
""Liar!"" Elise screamed. ""You're just jealous of Aunt Rosalind! That's why you threw away my toy! You're a bad mommy!""  
  
""When I grow up, I'm moving in with Aunt Rosalind,"" Jude grabbed his sister's hand, voice vicious. ""And I'm never coming back to see you!""  
  
Alaric didn't stop the kids' outburst. Just stood there with that slight frown, those deep eyes scanning Elowen like she was some hysterical stranger.  
  
""Enough."" His lips barely moved, that low voice carrying its usual arrogance as he adjusted his cufflinks with casual indifference. ""I've got a board meeting video call. Throw away whatever you want, just be quiet.""  
  
The moment the door closed, Elowen's tears finally fell.  
  
Her heart felt as like shredded, every breath tasting like blood.  
  
She wiped her eyes, looking at the mess around her, and suddenly... she laughed.  
  
Don't worry,she wouldn't disturb him.  
  
Never again in the rest of her life.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Ever since the divorce papers were signed, Elowen stopped taking care of the family matters.  
  
She no longer got up at 5 AM to prepare nutritious breakfasts for the kids, no longer waited up late at night to make sobering soup for Alaric when he came home from business dinners.  
  
All those chores she once considered her duty were now left to the maids.  
  
At first, no one noticed anything unusual.  
  
Until Jude was late for school and got scolded by his teacher, Elise couldn't find her homework notebook, and Alaric's pocket watch stopped working.  
  
The maids were running around frantically, but they could never meet the standards the lady of the house.  
  
Dirty dishes piled up in the kitchen, children's toys scattered across the living room, and the pressed shirts were never quite smooth enough.  
  
This once perfectly organized home was gradually falling apart.  
  
When Alaric pushed open the bedroom door, Elowen was leaning by the window reading a book.  
  
Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled shadows across her figure.  
  
""How long are you going to keep this nonsense up?"" He stood in the doorway, his voice low.  
  
Elowen closed her book and looked up at him. ""I'm not doing anything.""  
  
""Then why aren't you taking care of things around our house?"" He stepped closer, his subtle cologne filling the air. ""Still mad about last time?""  
  
""No."" She set the book aside. ""I just don't want to deal with it anymore.""  
  
Alaric narrowed his eyes, his long fingers tapping the table. ""Reason?""  
  
""I'm tired."" She said calmly. ""We have housekeeper and maids. The house runs fine without me.""  
  
She remembered her past life, getting up before dawn every single day.  
  
Alaric's coffee had to be exactly 85 degrees, his sandwiches toasted to golden perfection. The children's clothes had to be hand-washed, even their socks pressed smooth.  
  
And what did she get in return? Alaric's tenderness toward Rosalind, the children's attachment to ""Aunt Rosalind,"" and dying alone on her 62nd birthday.  
  
""Elowen."" His voice turned cold. ""If you're throwing a tantrum, just say so. Don't act like a three-year-old.""  
  
She gave a slight smile. ""I'm not throwing a tantrum. I just want to rest.""  
  
Before she finished speaking, the door was opened suddenly.  
  
Jude and Elise rushed in, their little faces full of anger.  
  
""Mom's being so lazy!"" Elise shrieked. ""We want Aunt Rosalind to take care of us!""  
  
Jude joined in the shouting. ""Aunt Rosalind is nicer than you, works harder than you, and is ten thousand times better than you!""  
  
Alaric kept his eyes locked on Elowen's face, as if waiting for her to give in.  
  
But she just took a deep breath and said quietly, ""If you all think she's better, then have her come here. I don't mind.""  
  
The air instantly froze.  
  
Alaric's expression darkened completely.  
  
""You sure about that?""  
  
Elowen took another deep breath. ""Absolutely sure.""  
  
""Daddy, let's go!"" Elise eagerly tugged at Alaric's sleeve. ""I want Aunt Rosalind to come over right now!""  
  
""Once we have Aunt Rosalind, we won't need you anymore!"" Jude made faces at Elowen. ""Just leave! Get out of this house!""  
  
Alaric took one last look at Elowen, and seeing she remained unmoved, he turned and strode out with the children.  
  
Elowen stood there, listening to the sound of the car engine fading away, and slowly closed her eyes.  
  
Soon, she would give them exactly what they wanted.  
  
She would leave them completely, leave this home.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
On the first day Rosalind moved in, she had the maids completely rearrange the living room.  
  
""This sofa set is too dreary."" Her delicate fingers brushed over the leather sofa, then turned to give Alaric a gentle smile. ""Alaric, how about we get a cream-colored one instead?""  
  
Alaric didn't even blink, immediately instructing the butler, ""Do whatever Miss Avery says.""  
  
Elowen stood at the stair landing, watching workers carry out the sofa she had carefully selected just six months ago.  
  
Jude and Elise followed Rosalind around like little puppies, excitedly pointing at things. ""Aunt Rosalind, let's change these throw pillows too! The ones Mom bought are so ugly!""  
  
Rosalind gently patted their heads. ""Sure, we'll change everything.""  
  
Elowen's fingers tightened slightly, then relaxed.  
  
Those pillows were hand-sewn by her during pregnancy, stuffed with hypoallergenic down because the children had sensitive skin when they were little.  
  
Now they were being ruthlessly tossed into the trash.  
  
Over the next few days, the house became increasingly unfamiliar.  
  
At the dinner table, Rosalind sat in what used to be Elowen's place, gently serving food to the two children.  
  
Alaric would occasionally pour her coffee himself, his long fingers sliding the cup over with a tenderness in his eyes that Elowen had never received.  
  
In the evenings, the living room lights would dim, and all four of them would crowd on the sofa watching movies.  
  
Elise would curl up in Rosalind's arms, Jude would lean against Alaric's shoulder, and laughter filled the air constantly.  
  
When Elowen passed by, they wouldn't even glance at her, as if she were invisible.  
  
What was more ridiculous was that Alaric, Jude, and Elise used to be incredibly demanding about quality of life.  
  
But now?  
  
She watched Rosalind carelessly toss his million-dollar watch onto the coffee table face-down, and he put it on with a doting smile.  
  
She saw the children happily wear school uniforms that Rosalind had just thrown in the washing machine, still stained with yesterday's sauce.  
  
She watched Rosalind pour takeout into dishes and claim she cooked it, and no one called her out.  
  
Even more ridiculous - they treated Rosalind like absolute queen.  
  
""Rosalind, don't touch that rough work.""  
  
Alaric stopped Rosalind from clearing the tea service, his long fingers gently pressing her wrist. ""Your hands are for playing piano.""  
  
""Aunt Rosalind, let me carry your bag!"" Jude eagerly took Rosalind's limited edition handbag, with a fawning expression Elowen had never seen on her son's face.  
  
""Miss Avery only needs to rest well,"" the housekeeper respectfully offered Italian handmade slippers. ""Leave everything else to us.""  
  
How ironic...  
  
She'd been this family's maid for six years, and they acted like she didn't exist.  
  
But the moment Rosalind arrived, she became their pampered princess.  
  
The servants gossiped privately too.  
  
""Mr.Whitmore is so good to Miss Avery. I've never seen him treat the Mrs.Whitmore like that.""  
  
""The kids are attached to her too. Mark my words, this house is getting a new lady soon!""  
  
Elowen's heart had turned to ash. She didn't care about anything anymore, just quietly packed her things.  
  
Until that afternoon, when her phone started buzzing frantically.  
  
""Ma'am! Elise and Jude had allergic reactions at school! The ambulance just took them to the hospital!""  
  
When Elowen reached the hospital, both children had been rushed into the emergency room.  
  
Alaric stood in the hallway, his suit jacket draped casually over his arm, tie hanging loose around his neck, cold fury churning in his eyes.  
  
""Elowen."" His voice was low, filled with suppressed rage. ""What the hell are you doing?""  
  
Elowen froze. ""What?""  
  
""They're allergic to mango. You know that, don't you?"" Alaric stepped closer, his tall frame looming over her. ""Why did you let them have the fucking mango juice?""  
  
""It wasn't me!"" Elowen looked him straight in the eye. ""I never buying mangoes into the house.""  
  
Ever since the children's first mango-induced hospitalization, she'd been extremely careful, warning everyone repeatedly not to give them mango, even personally checking the school cafeteria menus. How could she make such a basic mistake?  
  
""Not you?"" Alaric laughed coldly. ""Then who? The maids? Or did they want to die?""  
  
Elowen opened her mouth to respond when a nurse came out. ""The children are awake.""  
  
In the hospital room, Jude and Elise lay pale in their beds. When they saw them enter, their eyes flickered.  
  
""What happened?"" Alaric asked in a stern voice.  
  
The two children exchanged glances, then suddenly both pointed at Elowen. ""It was Mom! The cakes she bought before had mango in them!""  
  
Elowen went rigid, staring at them in disbelief. ""What are you saying?""

1lfwgsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1lfwgsi/i_had_a_paranormal_experience_15_years_ago_just/,"I had a paranormal experience 15 years ago. Just spoke to my twin today, he had the same one.","This post is not a creepy pasta, it is real, and is slightly disturbing (no violence, no sex, no NSFW just weird). I am a twin, we had a rough divorce growing up. It may have done things to my brain I am not sure.



I grew up in a old townhome from birth to around 7 years old. Me and my twin shared a room, with my two sisters in another room, and my Mom in the last. All connected in a small upstairs hallway. We were a fairly happy family, going out to church, great relationship with neighbors, good community.

But at night, I would get this overwhelming dark feeling when attempting to sleep. The strange thing is, I would feel this 'dark feeling' go OUTSIDE my window (we were on the 2nd floor) and 'dissipate' into the air out there. This feeling would make me shove my face into my pillow, too terrified to look up. It almost felt like I was glued or even pushed when I tried to move. I never once was able to look at the 'dark feeling' the terror was just too much. To be clear, it would start at my door, and leave out my window, just like that.

But... there was times where I woke up in the middle of the night and banged on my moms door and the feeling would come back, almost 'creeping up on me'. I would wake up in my bed the next morning as the immense dread / fear basically knocked me out, and it is just so unexplainable.



Then comes the ""sheep"" incident.

My home was visited by people, I know I was on the twin registry for my state, and perhaps was a research subject but these people were... strange. They came in and my mom asked me to come out and say hello. They were dressed not in suits, but more regular clothing and all they did was put 3 little sheep toys on the coffee table. My memories of this are faint, but I remember picking them up and that my brother was not in the room. The room was dead quiet as I played with them, and I felt their attention.

I don't want to exaggerated, but I can't remember much more about these sheep people.

Me and my family left this house when I was around 7 or 8 years old, I never had these problems again at my new house.



Fast forward to today...

I mention this dark feeling to my brother in an open-ended way, and say:

>Man \*name\* this sounds shciz but I remember as kids being able to feel a presence in our room in the \*location\* house... I have never been able to describe it. You remember this experience?

He then responds, in between my small messages with the following

>I do remember the constant dreams about a dark presence at our window in magnolia house if you remember that....

>And thinking it was like right next to pillow so I had to not open eyes....

>Did you ever have those similar dreams but you got up and tried to go to mom’s door, but it would get too scary / dark force too powerful.....

I was shook. His descriptions mirror my exact experience.

  


So, I come to this board for answers. I am 24 years old now, and have been struggling with anxiety and anti-social issues. I just want to get a better understanding of what happened, and figure out how to start healing. Apologies if the post was too long or dramatic, I wanted to include my emotion and be thorough.

There’s this layer that builds up at the bottom from the milk, sugar, and coffee. Sometimes it gets hard, and every now and then a little chunk breaks off and mixes into the drink. I know it sounds gross, but it honestly tastes kind of good.

It’s a bit like when marshmallows melt into hot chocolate. It changes the texture and gives it this weirdly sweet, rich flavor that’s hard to describe. Not everyone would be into it, but I’ve really come to enjoy it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine stepping into a beautiful two-story metal building home, often fondly referred to as a barndominium. This design not only provides a spacious living area but also showcases a unique blend of rustic charm and modern functionality. The benefits of choosing a metal building for your home are numerous, especially with an additional second floor that brings extra space and enhanced living possibilities.

One of the most significant advantages of two-story metal building homes is the vastness they offer. While single-story homes are limited in terms of horizontal space, a barndominium with a second floor allows you to maximize your living area without expanding the building’s footprint. This vertical approach is especially beneficial for those looking to create open-concept living spaces or accommodate larger families.

- **Flexible Floor Plans:** With a two-story layout, you have more options to customize your floor plan. You can design distinct areas for entertaining, relaxing, or working.
- **Enhanced Views:** A second floor grants you the opportunity for stunning views, especially if your property is located in a scenic area. Picture yourself enjoying a morning coffee while overlooking your lush surroundings.
- **Separation of Spaces:** You can easily create private zones within your home. For instance, use the upstairs for bedrooms or guest suites while keeping living and recreational spaces on the main level.

Moreover, the durability and low maintenance of metal building homes make them an attractive option. Unlike wood, metal is resistant to many of the problems homeowners face, such as termites, rot, and mold. This quality translates to a longer lifespan for your home and fewer repairs over time. The energy efficiency of metal also cannot be overlooked. Insulated metal buildings provide excellent temperature control, allowing homeowners to save significantly on heating and cooling costs.

When it comes to modern living, aesthetics play a vital role. Two-story metal building homes offer endless design possibilities. The exterior can be customized with appealing finishes, and the interior can be tailored to reflect your personal style. From sleek and contemporary to rustic and warm, you can create a space that not only suits your needs but also showcases your personality.

- **Customizable Exteriors:** Choose colors, textures, and styles that fit your vision, making your home distinct.
- **Open Spaces:** High ceilings and large windows can be designed to enhance natural light, creating a bright and airy feel.
- **Unique Architecture:** The combination of metal and traditional elements can yield a truly unique home that stands out in any neighborhood.

Additionally, two-story metal building homes are an excellent choice for energy-conscious individuals. Many barndominiums feature efficient insulation, programmable thermostats, and even solar panel options. These features not only minimize your carbon footprint but also lead to reduced utility bills. When you can enjoy stylish living while being eco-friendly, it's a win-win.

Another key advantage is the potential cost-effectiveness of building a two-story metal home. Generally, metal structures can be more affordable than traditional wood-frame buildings. If you factor in the reduced maintenance and energy costs, the long-term savings can be significant. You get a beautiful and functional home without breaking the bank, making it an excellent investment in your future.

If you have a vision of your dream living space, a two-story metal building could be the perfect solution for you. By blending practicality and style, these homes meet the needs of modern families while providing the luxury of space and comfort. Whether you're seeking an innovative design or merely want to make the most out of your property’s square footage, exploring the benefits of barndominiums with a second floor will reveal that they truly represent the future of homebuilding.

The unique appeal of two-story metal building homes lies in their versatility, durability, aesthetic appeal, and cost-effectiveness. They are spacious barndominiums ready to accommodate the demands of modern living while providing a remarkable living environment. Choose this innovative option today and create the stylish and functional space you've always desired.

Design Ideas for Making the Most of Your Two Story Metal Barndominium Space
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to designing your two-story metal barndominium, the possibilities are endless. These spacious homes often feature expansive floor plans that allow for creativity and functionality. Whether you’re looking to maximize your living space or create a cozy atmosphere, the right design ideas can make all the difference.

One effective way to start planning your barndominium layout is by considering an open floor concept for the main area. This not only enhances the flow of the space but also encourages social interaction. Imagine walking into a large living room that seamlessly connects with the kitchen and dining area. You can achieve this by using large, strategic windows to invite natural light. Light colors in the decor and furnishings can also help make the space appear even larger than it is.

Another practical idea is to create multi-functional spaces. For instance, a home office can double as a guest room. Consider adding a Murphy bed or a sofa bed in your office area, allowing it to serve multiple purposes effectively. This is particularly useful in a barndominium where efficient use of space is vital.

The layout of the second floor offers even more opportunities for creativity. Many homeowners choose to place bedrooms or a master suite upstairs to take advantage of the high ceilings and views provided by the large windows. Adding a balcony can enhance this experience, allowing for outdoor relaxation. Think about installing sliding glass doors that lead out to this balcony, promoting indoor-outdoor living.

For those who love entertaining, why not incorporate a game room or a media center on the second floor? This space can become a fun retreat for family and friends. Use plush furniture and comfortable seating to create the perfect atmosphere for movie nights or game days. A small kitchenette can also prove handy for snacks and drinks.

When designing your two-story metal barndominium, consider the importance of storage. Utilizing vertical space can alleviate clutter and help keep the home organized. built-in shelving or cabinets under the stairs can offer practical solutions without sacrificing aesthetics. Additionally, think about creating a storage area at the rear of the home for tools and household items.

Light fixtures play a vital role in setting the mood of your living areas. In the main level, consider installing pendant lights over the kitchen island or dining table for a stylish touch. On the second floor, utilize wall sconces in hallways or bedrooms to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Dimmers can also be an excellent investment, allowing you to adjust the lighting according to your needs.

Outside your barndominium, the landscaping can greatly enhance its overall appeal. Create a charming entryway with potted plants and welcoming lighting. A wrap-around porch can provide a space for outdoor living and entertaining. Furniture that can handle the elements while offering comfort will add to your enjoyment of this space.

Consider the use of color in both the interior and exterior of your two-story barndominium. Neutral tones can make the space feel calm and open, while pops of color can be added through furniture, textiles, or decorative accents. This balance can help draw attention to certain areas of your home and make it uniquely yours.

Don't forget about the roof. A stylish and functional roof can add character to your barndominium. Choose materials and colors that complement the overall aesthetic. A gabled roof, for instance, not only enhances the look but also provides extra room for storage or even a loft area.

With thoughtful planning and innovative design, your two-story metal barndominium can be transformed into a spacious and functional home. By considering aspects such as multi-functional spaces, effective use of light, and personal touches, you can create an inviting environment that meets all your needs. Embrace the unique potential of your barndominium and enjoy making it your own.

### Conclusion

Two story metal building homes, specifically barndominiums with a second floor, offer a unique blend of functionality and style that is perfect for today’s families. These spacious designs not only provide ample living space but also encourage creativity in layout and decor. The open floor plans allow for versatile uses, whether you dream of an expansive family room, a cozy office nook, or a stunning entertainment area. Each homeowner can tailor their barndominium to reflect personal tastes and lifestyle needs.

When considering design ideas, think about maximizing natural light with large windows and incorporating multi-purpose rooms that can evolve as your family grows. High ceilings and creative use of vertical space can make the second floor a sanctuary, whether that be for bedrooms or a dedicated workspace. Don’t overlook outdoor spaces, too—balconies or wrap-around porches can enhance your home’s aesthetic and offer relaxing spots to unwind.

Ultimately, opting for a two story metal building home is not just about creating a structure; it’s about building a life. Whether you choose rustic charm or sleek modernity, these barndominiums stand as a testament to innovative living. As you envision your dream space, remember that the potential is limitless. Let your creativity flow and design a home that is truly yours, while embracing all the practical advantages that a two-story structure brings to modern living.",1,1750398158.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

I’ve been using this seat cover in the back of my SUV for a few weeks now, mostly for hauling my dog around after hikes. It fits the bench seat well and actually stays in place thanks to the adjustable straps and seat anchors.

The material is fully waterproof, I’ve had muddy paws, wet fur, and even the occasional coffee spill hit it, and none of it got through to the seat. Just wipes clean with a cloth. I haven’t needed to machine wash it yet, but it feels like it would handle that fine too.

It doesn’t feel too stiff or plasticky either, which I was worried about. My dog seems comfortable sitting or lying on it, and the stitching has held up even with some claw action. Definitely worth grabbing if you’ve got pets or kids and want to keep your seats from getting trashed.

Now the mask is off, and I want out.","Throwaway account. I’m feeling really confused and kind of stuck. Looking for some honest advice.

I recently came back home after finishing college and an internship. I was in a serious 3-year relationship during college, but we broke up on mutual terms. It hurt, but I eventually moved on and decided to give dating another shot.

I matched with a girl on a dating app. Early on, she admitted the profile picture wasn’t hers—it was from Pinterest. She said it was out of fear of being judged or recognized. I appreciated the honesty. We exchanged Instagrams, and while she wasn’t my type physically, she seemed okay. I’ve always believed that personality matters more than looks, so I gave it a chance.

We met the same day—she asked for a ride home from the salon and we ended up grabbing coffee. She talked about being down-to-earth, liking simple things like meaningful movies and good music, and claimed she was looking for a genuine, non-materialistic guy. Basically, everything I said, she agreed with. Our conversations felt tailor-made. She was mirroring me, but I didn’t see it at the time.

As we kept meeting, the image started to crack.

She became rude to waiters, made fun of strangers, constantly insulted her friends and family behind their backs. The kindness she preached was all talk. She started caring a lot about material things—constantly talking about what influencers have and how she wanted the same. I’m a simple guy—I don’t care about status, trends, or what other people are doing. I just try to be kind and do better than yesterday.

What really gets me is that she **lied about everything** just to go out with me. Her music taste, movie preferences, personality—she shaped it all to seem “compatible.” And she even told me early on, “I feel like you’ll ditch me one day.” Ironic, because now I see the real her, and I’m not into it at all.

She’s told all her friends we’re dating. She talks about “our future.” But the truth is:

* I’m not physically attracted to her.
* I don’t like her personality now that she’s dropped the act.
* I feel tricked—she basically catfished me, emotionally and visually.

I don’t want to hurt her, but I can’t keep pretending. I’m not in this. I just want to leave this situation respectfully, but clearly.

**What’s the best way to end something like this when it feels like the person you started dating never really existed?**

**TL;DR**:  
Met a girl on a dating app who used a fake photo and pretended to be the “perfect match.” Over time, her real personality came out—rude, materialistic, and dishonest. I’m not attracted to her and I feel emotionally catfished. She’s told people we’re dating and is planning a future, but I want out. How do I end this honestly but kindly?

I came into real estate and have been enjoying the tax deductions to home/property upgrades as I have both long term and airbnb. 

Everything is basically 20-30% for my properties, even as far as coffee and toilet paper for my airbnb to any repairs on things like boilers/doors. It helps justify this so much more. 

I feel quite optimized for everyone’s largest expense, home ownership.

So as my 2nd and really only biggest expense is travel as I travel for family/luxury 4-5 times a year, I’d like to be optimal while staying in my lane and try to do something business related for traveling.

Airfare, lodging, and events at 20-30% is nice enough that I’d allocate due time to its endeavor while also then, or being with, my family/friends.

The business cards I have with Amex and Chase give the best point values for travel as well, which keeps bothering me.

I’ve researched, and as long as I have proper intent, income isn’t a requirement.

Any thoughts or experiences?

Medium/substack travel blogs comes to mind. I already do that with my own social media with great pictures and adventures.

Vlogging/youtube was a thought, but I hate being on camera/center of attention as I believe it takes away from an experience making it artificial, but I could just use my normal footage and pay someone on fiver to edit it.

As a hobby, I do financial consulting for friends, but American economics isn’t something that I could consult for on internationally. 

I could also try photography (with my phone) but while that’s fun for personal social media, I have a bias that it’s a waste of time as it all already exists, rather its purpose being for journalism or to resurface cultures and history. 

A bit lost and want to not take advantage, but to optimize and expand for my own life.

Trying to do things I can use myself. But they’re completely correlated to a business.

1lfw2cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lfw2cn/she_lied_about_who_she_was_to_date_me_now_the/,"She lied about who she was to date me. Now the mask is off, and I want out.","Throwaway account. I’m feeling really confused and kind of stuck. Looking for some honest advice.

I recently came back home after finishing college and an internship. I was in a serious 3-year relationship during college, but we broke up on mutual terms. It hurt, but I eventually moved on and decided to give dating another shot.

I matched with a girl on a dating app. Early on, she admitted the profile picture wasn’t hers—it was from Pinterest. She said it was out of fear of being judged or recognized. I appreciated the honesty. We exchanged Instagrams, and while she wasn’t my type physically, she seemed okay. I’ve always believed that personality matters more than looks, so I gave it a chance.

We met the same day—she asked for a ride home from the salon and we ended up grabbing coffee. She talked about being down-to-earth, liking simple things like meaningful movies and good music, and claimed she was looking for a genuine, non-materialistic guy. Basically, everything I said, she agreed with. Our conversations felt tailor-made. She was mirroring me, but I didn’t see it at the time.

As we kept meeting, the image started to crack.

She became rude to waiters, made fun of strangers, constantly insulted her friends and family behind their backs. The kindness she preached was all talk. She started caring a lot about material things—constantly talking about what influencers have and how she wanted the same. I’m a simple guy—I don’t care about status, trends, or what other people are doing. I just try to be kind and do better than yesterday.

What really gets me is that she **lied about everything** just to go out with me. Her music taste, movie preferences, personality—she shaped it all to seem “compatible.” And she even told me early on, “I feel like you’ll ditch me one day.” Ironic, because now I see the real her, and I’m not into it at all.

She’s told all her friends we’re dating. She talks about “our future.” But the truth is:

* I’m not physically attracted to her.
* I don’t like her personality now that she’s dropped the act.
* I feel tricked—she basically catfished me, emotionally and visually.

I don’t want to hurt her, but I can’t keep pretending. I’m not in this. I just want to leave this situation respectfully, but clearly.

**What’s the best way to end something like this when it feels like the person you started dating never really existed?**

**TL;DR**:  
Met a girl on a dating app who used a fake photo and pretended to be the “perfect match.” Over time, her real personality came out—rude, materialistic, and dishonest. I’m not attracted to her and I feel emotionally catfished. She’s told people we’re dating and is planning a future, but I want out. How do I end this honestly but kindly?

This will be my final unsent letter. I'm sorry it has to end this way 💔 

I know we both grew tired from holding onto the friendship, and somewhere along the way, we burned ourselves out trying to keep it alive. I understand why you felt exhausted—it wasn’t easy for either of us. I wish I had been stronger. I wish we could’ve found a way to make it work. But I’ve come to realize that maybe we’ve simply outgrown each other, and it’s time to let go.

I’m grateful we were able to talk things through in the end. Reaching a mutual decision to part ways wasn’t easy, but we knew continuing would only bring more hurt. We both felt the weight of it, and letting go was the kindest thing we could do for ourselves.

I’ll cherish our friendship in my own little way. One fond memory of us I remember was a random Tuesday evening walk you said “I wish we were besties”. With a smirk on my face I said “wdym? I always thought of you as mine” and the way your face lit up just made everything worthwhile. 

I won’t lie—I’ll miss us. We shared so much. I’ll see traces of you everywhere: in our old office building, the coffee shops downstairs, the food spots we loved, even those corner chairs where you’d wait for me to finish work. You were such a significant part of my life. Just remember that I’ll always carry memories of you in my heart 💛",5,1750397189.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I’m not looking for anything super high-end — just a stylish, comfortable, and durable set that’s great for relaxing, entertaining, or enjoying my morning coffee outside.

I’ve seen some really cute and affordable options, but I’m curious about the quality, comfort, and how well they hold up over time (especially in different weather conditions).

Ideally, I’m looking for a set that’s:

* Comfortable with supportive cushions
* Weather-resistant and low-maintenance
* Easy to assemble and move around
* Stylish enough to elevate a patio or deck
* Affordable without feeling flimsy

Here are a few sets I’ve been considering:

* **Better Homes & Gardens Clayton Court 4-Piece Patio Conversation Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Brookbury 5-Piece Outdoor Dining Set**
* **BH&G Ravenbrooke Wicker Sectional Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Camrose Farmhouse Outdoor Bench**
* **BH&G Hawthorne Park Bistro Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage Steel Conversation Set**
* **BH&G Ventura Stationary Rocking Chairs Set**

If you’ve purchased any of these or have experience with **Better Homes & Gardens patio furniture** in general, I’d love to know how it’s held up for you — especially over time or in rain/sun-heavy areas. Also open to tips on cushions, storage, and whether it's worth buying the furniture covers or extra accessories.

I was having coffee beside RK Cinecomplex,
Banjara Hills.
I was minding my own business with my earphones on, listening to music
and enjoying the coffee.

Two girls came and sat beside me, near the next basement.
Suddenly, a guy came and stood opposite them. He pulled out his phone, pretending to talk to someone, with the camera pointed in their direction.
I definitely sensed he was secretly taking their photos.

Before I could react and go ask him, one of the girls walked up to him and asked, ""Kya kar rahe ho?""
He said, ""Phone pe baat kar raha hoon,"" and showed his screen, where a WhatsApp chat was open. He wasn't on any call.
She told him, ""Udhar jaake baat kar lo,""
and he just left.

Before that, they were chilling and giggling.
After this, they just sat in silence. I felt very bad.
I'm certain he came there just to take their photos.
These buggers...

You did a great job, girl.
I wanted to tell her at that moment itself,
but I didn’t know how it would make them feel.

1lfvwy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AffiGrowth/comments/1lfvwy9/lowcost_affiliate_marketing_tools/,Low-cost Affiliate Marketing Tools,"I used to think you needed expensive software to make affiliate marketing work. Dropped hundreds on ""premium"" tools that promised instant success, only to realize some of the best results come from tools that cost less than your monthly coffee budget.

## **Here's What I Discovered After Testing 20+ Tools:**

Get the whole story [on my blog](https://clintherman.com/low-cost-affiliate-marketing-tools)

• **ClickBank + Canva combo absolutely crushes it** – Started by finding products with decent commission rates on ClickBank, then used Canva's free plan to create eye-catching promotional graphics and social media posts. The visual content made a massive difference in engagement rates compared to plain text posts. What surprised me most was how professional-looking graphics could be created in minutes without any design experience. The templates are solid, and you can customize everything to match your brand.

• **Buffer's free tier is seriously underrated for consistency** – This changed my entire posting strategy. Instead of scrambling to post content randomly, I started scheduling posts across multiple platforms every Sunday for the entire week. Regular posting beats sporadic bursts every single time, and the free version handles 3 social profiles perfectly. The analytics showed my engagement doubled just from consistent posting timing.

• **Bitly completely changed my tracking game** – This was a game-changer I wish I'd discovered earlier. Started shortening all my affiliate links and tracking clicks religiously. Finally knew which content was actually converting instead of just throwing posts into the void and hoping. The click data revealed some surprising patterns about what my audience actually wanted versus what I thought they wanted.

## **The Biggest Mistakes I See People Make (Don't Be These People):**

1. **Jumping to paid tools way too early** – Master the free versions first before upgrading. I wasted $200 learning this lesson.
2. **Not tracking their links at all** – You're literally flying blind without click data  
3. **Completely ignoring email marketing** – Mailchimp's free tier can handle 2,000 contacts, yet most people skip this entirely
4. **Skipping basic SEO fundamentals** – Google Analytics is completely free and tells you everything about your traffic sources
5. **Trying to be everywhere at once** – Pick one platform, master it, then expand

## **Real Results from Budget Tools (These Numbers Shocked Me):**

The research I did for my comprehensive blog post revealed some seriously impressive case studies that prove budget tools work.

A fitness coach named Sarah went from $500 to $2,500 monthly income in just six months using only Canva and Mailchimp. Her email list exploded from 200 to 1,100 subscribers, and her conversion rate jumped from a measly 1% to a solid 5%. Total tool budget: under $50.

John, a tech reviewer, hit $3,000 monthly after 12 months with WordPress and social media scheduling. His monthly visitors went from 500 to 15,000, and he grew his social media following from 300 to 5,000 engaged followers. He spent less than $200 on tools total.

Emily, a fashion blogger, started with only $150 and reached $5,000 monthly income in two years using Buffer and Google Analytics. Her page views exploded from 2,000 to 25,000 monthly, and she landed 25 brand partnerships.

The common thread across all success stories? They focused obsessively on consistency and tracking rather than expensive software with fancy features they didn't need.

## **My Current Winning Budget Stack:**

- **Content creation:** Canva (free plan covers 90% of needs)
- **Email marketing:** Mailchimp (free up to 2,000 contacts)
- **Social media scheduling:** Buffer (free for 3 profiles)
- **Website analytics:** Google Analytics (completely free)
- **Link tracking:** Bitly (free for basic tracking)
- **Affiliate networks:** Amazon Associates and ClickBank (free to join)

Total monthly cost to start: $0. Maybe $13/month if you eventually upgrade Canva Pro for extra features.

**What's your experience with budget affiliate marketing tools? Are you stuck choosing between free and paid options, or have you found a winning combination that doesn't break the bank? I'm curious what's working for everyone else.**

1lfvw0k,https://i.redd.it/8168wpcsn08f1.jpeg,Should I seek a specialist? c-spine trauma,"Should I seek a second opinion? 

I am 6 weeks post-trauma. I was rear-ended on the highway. My car was at a full-stop (cars in front of me stopped) and the 3 cars behind me were not able to stop. I had my left hand on the steering wheel when I braced for impact. 

I have been experiencing a stabbing, sometimes burning, sometimes pinching pain between my left shoulder and spine. My neck pain/migraines/neck stiffness have improved. Around week 3 I began to have radiating pain down my left arm, pain in my elbow, loss of strength in my fingers and arm, and other electric-shock like sensations off that vary depending on my activity. The pain seems to be getting worse in my arm and the pain between my shoulder/spine is constant.

I have scoliosis and most of my curvature is in my lumbar spine. I did not have any known problems in my upper back and no previous shoulder pain. Prior to my injury I lifted weights multiple times a week and worked with a trainer (she has helped me work on balance, mobility, and proper form). I work as a high school ceramics teacher and have worked hard to train my body to support my spine in an attempt to prevent injury to my back because I love what I do and it involves a lot of physical activity. Anyhoo….

I recently jumped through all of the hoops and was able to get the chiropractor I have been seeing to order an MRI. He went over my results with me today and said my injury should heal with conservative treatment (at this point they just slap a lidocaine patch on me and ask me to rate my pain). He said he wasn’t concerned about my results.

My results show:

4 mm herniation at c5-c6 and 3.5 mm at c6-c7. The thecal sac is pressed & ligament is lifted. Bone spurs at front and back & disc material goes behind bone spurs. Bright spots on discs that indicate tears. 9 mm spinal canal narrowing. Moderate right and mild left nerve passage narrowing. C5 is slightly moved back (2mm) compared to c6. 

I have other tears in my t spine on the scan but the two above are most notable. Should I be worried about nerve damage? I’m worried about the pain/weakness I am having in my arm & shoulder. I’m dropping stuff (I dropped a whole cup of coffee the other day!) and am having a hard time sleeping. I have been keeping my activity extremely light. This chiro can’t seem to tell me what I should or shouldn’t do activity wise. They started me on some physical therapy, but it is a joke (essentially they sent me a list of like 100 different exercises I could do and had me zoom with their PT, no guided activity whatsoever). I told him after seeing my MRI, that I’m not comfortable being adjusted at this time (don’t think it was helping anyway). 

How big of a herniation is concerning in the cervical spine? From what I understand, the combination of factors is what makes it more severe. What would you do if you were in my shoes? Ultimately I hope to avoid chronic pain. I already have chronic pain in my lower back and am struggling to accept both. Really stressing about returning to work in a month when the new school year starts considering the amount of lifting/bending/twisting my job requires. Thanks for reading. I felt really dismissed regarding my concerns today at my appointment and wonder what others have experienced that might provide other insight. ",1,1750396707.0,backpain,3,1.0,False

My very sarcastic, mom in law will most certainly be staying with us going forward and I’m dreading it!","I (38M) am in a bit of a tough spot and would appreciate some perspective. My amazing wife (34F) and I have been together for 6+ years and recently had our first child — a beautiful 5-month-old baby. Life should be joyful right now, but there’s a shadow over our home.

My mother-in-law is now living with us indefinitely.

Here’s the backstory: She and my father-in-law came to stay with us shortly after the baby was born. Tragically, we lost my father-in-law during that time. Since then, we haven’t had the heart to send her back to her own flat in another city — and her other child (my wife’s sibling) lives abroad in a country that restricts parent visits to one month.

So, by default, she’s staying with us for the foreseeable future.

The problem is… I’m dreading it. She’s always been an extremely sarcastic and judgmental person — the kind who can make even a compliment sound like a criticism. I used to be able to tolerate it in small doses during short visits. But now, every day at home feels like I’m walking on eggshells in my own sanctuary.

Home has always been my safe space. A place to be myself, decompress, and connect with my wife. Now, I feel observed and judged constantly. Even small things — like how I fold laundry or make coffee — are fair game for her sarcasm. I’ve started working longer hours just to avoid the tension at home, even though I know my wife could use more support with the baby.

My wife is deeply supportive, and I love her to bits. She acknowledges her mom can be “difficult” but tends to shrug it off with “That’s just her nature.” But for me, the sarcastic digs are starting to cause real friction — not just with her mom, but sometimes between us too.

There’s no set end date for this living arrangement, and that’s what’s eating me up inside. I don’t want to harbor resentment or destroy the relationship with my MIL, but right now, I feel stuck — mentally and emotionally.

So Reddit, am I overreacting? How do I set boundaries, protect my peace, and support my wife while not losing myself in this?

Any advice on surviving this situation without blowing it up would be really appreciated.

I need to tell someone about what I found in my building, even though I’m not sure anyone will believe me. Maybe especially because I’m not sure anyone will believe me.

It started three weeks ago when my phone died. Not the battery – the whole thing just… stopped. Screen went black mid-scroll through Instagram, and it wouldn’t turn on again. The repair shop said they’d never seen anything like it. “Total electrical failure,” the guy told me, shaking his head. “Like something just fried every circuit at once.”

I should have been devastated. My phone was my lifeline – work emails, social media, news, entertainment, everything. But sitting in that repair shop, I felt something unexpected: relief. The constant buzzing anxiety in my chest, the phantom vibrations, the compulsive checking – it all just… stopped.

For the first time in years, I walked home in complete silence.

That’s when I heard it.

A low humming coming from somewhere in my building. Not mechanical – more like… voices? Singing? I’d lived in this converted warehouse for two years and never noticed it before. But now, without the constant digital noise, it was unmistakable.

I followed the sound to the fourth floor, where it seemed strongest near apartment 4B. I’d never seen anyone go in or out of 4B. In fact, I couldn’t remember seeing a name on the mailbox for that unit.

The humming stopped the moment I knocked.

“Hello?” I called out, feeling foolish.

The door opened slowly, revealing a woman about my age with kind eyes and flour under her fingernails. She looked… present. Really present, in a way I hadn’t seen in anyone for months.

“You heard us,” she said simply, and smiled. “We’ve been wondering when you would.”

She introduced herself as Maya and invited me in. The apartment was nothing like mine – no screens anywhere, just books and plants and musical instruments scattered around. The air smelled like bread and something else… hope, maybe? If hope had a smell.

“We meet here every Thursday,” Maya explained, gesturing to a circle of mismatched chairs. “Just to be together. Really together.”

She explained that their little group had started accidentally. Power outage last winter, neighbors helping neighbors, conversation by candlelight. “We realized we’d forgotten how to just… exist in the same space without performing for an audience,” she said.

I was skeptical at first. It sounded like some kind of cult. But Maya just laughed. “The only thing we worship is the radical act of being genuinely present with each other.”

That Thursday, I knocked on 4B again.

There were six of them gathered in the circle: Maya, an elderly man named Harold who used to be a librarian, a young mother named Sage, twins named River and Rain who spoke in overlapping sentences, and Marcus, who’d been a software engineer before what he called “the great unplugging.”

They didn’t talk about their problems at first. They just… sat. Breathed together. Harold read poetry aloud. Sage showed everyone how to braid friendship bracelets. The twins harmonized to half-remembered lullabies.

It should have been boring. It should have felt like a waste of time.

Instead, for the first time in months, I felt like I could breathe.

“We call it the Signal,” Maya explained during my third week. “Not the radio kind. The human kind. The frequency we all used to operate on before we forgot.”

That’s when things got strange.

I started noticing the Signal everywhere. The way the barista at my coffee shop actually made eye contact when she handed me my drink. How my elderly neighbor lingered in conversations instead of rushing away. The group of teenagers I saw sharing one pair of earbuds on the subway, laughing at something only they could hear.

But it was more than that. I began to see the networks – invisible threads connecting people who were really present with each other. Like some kind of alternative internet that ran on attention instead of algorithms.

And the scariest part? I could tell when someone was completely disconnected from it. They moved differently, looked through people instead of at them. Their eyes had this glassy, hungry quality, like they were always searching for the next notification, the next hit of artificial engagement.

I’d looked like that too, I realized. We all had.

Last Thursday, something incredible happened. We were sitting in our circle when Harold mentioned he’d been feeling isolated since his wife died. River immediately offered to teach him to text his grandson. Sage said her book club needed a poetry expert. Maya promised to bring him soup.

I watched this happen – this spontaneous web of care forming around Harold – and I understood something that made my chest tighten with recognition.

This is what we’d been looking for in all those feeds and posts and comments. This feeling of being truly seen and valued. But we’d been trying to find it through screens, through curated versions of ourselves, through the approval of strangers.

The real Signal had been here all along. We’d just forgotten how to tune in.

I got my phone back yesterday. The repair shop called it a miracle – everything somehow worked perfectly again. But when I held it, all I could think about was Maya’s words: “The only thing we worship is the radical act of being genuinely present.”

I almost didn’t go to the group tonight because I was afraid. Afraid they’d see my phone and think I was choosing the algorithm over them. Afraid I’d start checking notifications mid-conversation. Afraid I’d forget again.

But Maya just smiled when she saw the phone in my hand. “The Signal doesn’t disappear when you have technology,” she said. “It just gets easier to ignore.”

She was right. I kept the phone in my pocket the whole evening. And you know what? The Signal was stronger than ever.

As I write this, I can feel it humming through the building. Not just from 4B anymore, but from other apartments too. People remembering how to really see each other. How to be present without performing.

I know how this sounds. I know it sounds like I’m describing some impossible utopia, some too-good-to-be-true community that couldn’t exist in the real world.

But here’s the thing that terrifies me and fills me with hope in equal measure: it’s not impossible. It’s actually the most natural thing in the world. We just convinced ourselves it wasn’t.

The Signal is real. It’s been broadcasting this whole time, underneath all the digital noise. You probably felt it during the pandemic when neighbors started talking to each other again. You might catch glimpses of it at coffee shops where people look up from their phones to smile at strangers. It’s there in the spaces between posts, in the silence after notifications stop buzzing.

It’s in the choice to be where you are, with who you’re with, fully and completely.

The group is growing. Maya says there are other circles forming in other buildings, other neighborhoods. A quiet revolution of presence spreading through a network that can’t be monetized or manipulated or shut down by corporate interests.

If you’re reading this and something resonates, if you feel that hunger for real connection that no amount of scrolling can satisfy, know that you’re not alone. The Signal is there, waiting for you to remember how to hear it.

Maybe start small. Look up from your screen and really see someone today. Have a conversation without checking your phone. Sit in silence with another person and just… be.

The humming is getting louder.

I am very close with my friend lets call him Aman, We've been friends for a long time. Coincidentally we work at the same place. There's a girl in our office let's call her Anshika.

One day I was drinking coffee with Anshika and she randomly asked me if I liked someone, now we're also good friends so it wouldn't have been totally unexpected for me to say it to her but I froze and blabbered ""Abe nhii, ye sab relationship vagera me kya hi rakkha hai🤣🤣"" which obviously I didn't mean.
She was like ""Oh.....that's too bad"". Anyway then I asked her who she likes, and she said "" aise to koi nhi hai, yaha tu aur Aman hi thode thik thak se hai baki logo se vibe match nhi hoti""

Yeah I know I messed up, whatever. And now comes the intresting part, last weekend I was drinking with Aman, and he confessed while a bit drunk that he likes Anshika, and I don't what happened, I encouraged him to asker her out and lo and behold they told me they're dating now.

1lfvteg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lfvteg/not_really_excited_about_sobriety/,Not really excited about sobriety,"This will probably end up being a venting post, although I'd love to hear other people's experiences and advice as well.

Sobriety has been overall good, and I've seen some improvements for sure. Being able to keep more of the money I earn, better sleep, more self awareness, better communication/relationships, being able to make and hit goals, better health, better performance at work, less brutal cravings as time goes on, all of that. Which genuinely feels great to achieve! At the time of writing this, I've hit 7 months sober about a week ago, and I don't regret my sober time.

My dilemma is that I'm just not excited about it. Not really. It's just this feeling of .... ""Cool. Next."" Life isn't really great. It's good, but there's definitely something missing. Full disclosure, I haven't really made a huge effort to connect with other people. The main reason for this is because I don't want to be asked to go out for drinks after work (I work in restaurants) and then feel like that will put me in the position of having to explain that I don't drink. (Side note: AA isn't really my thing. I've tried, but it just doesn't feel like a good fit. I'm not unwilling to try again, but I also don't connect with the program or the people like I've been hearing others do.) Plus, working in restaurants doesn't earn me a great living, and I'm not earning enough to have the money to travel, invest in a hobby, or really do much other than to go to local coffee shops or pick up some yarn to knit with. I don't have a car, which financially is a major plus because of how expensive they are, but it also severely limits my job opportunities and my ability to be independent outside of a 5ish-km radius (I don't typically use public transit).

Kinda just feels like sobriety is a bit of a boring, monotonous, lonely slog rather than something I look forward to waking up to every day. I definitely don't hate it, and I plan on continuing my sobriety, but I just don't find any real joy in my day-to-day life as it currently is, and I'm stuck in a rut.

Am I doing it wrong? 😅 I've been trying to do a mindset change, and I think some of what I'm experiencing may be me looking at this in the wrong way.

Rationally, I know that I can't be *that* ""ugly"" if I don't consider the majority of people I see out in public as ""ugly."" In fact, I know that by society's standards,  I'm at the very least average as people have made positive comments about my appearance. **But I can't help but feel ugly**. Every day, I wake up and dread looking at myself in the mirror because I hate what I see. I feel ugly, I feel like my face is puffy and that my freckles don't suit me, and it makes me feel disgusting. 

I want to change myself, and for that to happen I know that I need to change my eating habits. I eat even when I'm feeling full, just because I like the taste of food or because I'm bored. In the mornings, I eat breakfast even though I'm not hungry—it's like an automatic function of my life and I just feel restless if I don't eat. I also drink a lot of liquid calories (coffee and hot chocolate) which I know doesn't help my situation. My portion sizes are also bigger than they should be (but not to the extreme). My BMI is in the healthy range, but it's on the higher side and I'd like to reduce this. I also would like to start running 5 days a week, but I can't muster the energy to take myself to the gym and run. 

I just want to look and feel good about myself. **I'm sick of feeling so disgusting and ugly**, and I want to change but at the same time I feel so overwhelmed and unmotivated. Writing this, everything I say sounds so contradictory but this is how I generally feel, and I would like some advice. I'm willing to accept any advice whether it's tough love or not, as long as it's helpful. I'd also like to know if anyone else felt this way and were able to change their life around. Thanks.

I have built a small coffee shop with a flat above. The price of this lot is just under 20,000 Simoleons so your Sims can get to business right away, instead of saving up over a long time before being able to purchase their own business.

I built this on the cheapest lot in Nordhaven which is a 20x20 lot, giving your Sims enough space to expand their business and home once the Simoleons start rolling in.

Just a note: If you place this on an empty lot that costs more than 750 Simoleons, such as a 1000 Simoleon lot, the overall price would come to 1,028 Simoleons, but your Sim could move into a starter home first, collect 28 Simoleons and then purchase this Starter Home & Coffee Shop.

If you want your Sims to purchase this straight away and don’t want to save up 28 Simoleons, you can bulldoze the Canal Corner home that sits on the 20x15 lot in Evergreen Harbor, which then leaves you with a 750 Simoleon empty lot.

He found out I had experimented with another boy when I was in high school and he tried to physically punish the gay out of me. My mother did nothing to stop him. My siblings also did nothing. Only my grandmother, my father's mom helped me. She took me in after he kicked me out. 

I lived with her until I finished high school and while I attended trade school. That was twenty years ago. She passed in 2012 and she is the only person in my family I miss. 

My father passed away during COVID because he is, was, and ever shall be an unmitigated, uneducated, religious asshole that thought vaccines were a conspiracy. I am grateful for that virus. 

Anyways it's been a few years now and I spoke with my mother. She knew I got married and had a child with my wife and she was upset that I had not invited them to my wedding or to meet my kid. I reminded her that I had invited her to come but she insisted on bringing my father so I recinded the invitation. She tried saying that I had to forgive him and that he was a product of his time. I pointed out that his fucking mother was the one who took me in when they threw me out like trash and that I imagine she lived in an even more extreme time. 

Anyway to the point. I agreed to meet with her and hear her out. We went for coffee near our old neighborhood where my grandmother, grandfather, and father are buried. In my city we actually have a cemetery with a busy road that runs through the middle of it. 

My mother asked if I wanted to pay my respects to my grandmother while I was there. I said no because I think when you are dead you are dead. I have pictures of my grandmother in my home and I remember her all the time. My mother insisted we should go since we were right there anyways. I agreed but in my mind I basically wrote off this relationship if she couldn't even respect my wishes this much. 

Instead of going to my grandmother's gravesite she took me to my dad's. I asked her WTF she was thinking and why she would bring me there. She said that I needed to forgive my father and get closure. So I told her that I would get closure my way and I pissed on his grave and gravestone. Then I went to my car and left. 

My wife understands why I did what I did but she thinks I should have humoured my mom. I actually did get closure and I feel.great about what I did. 

Am I the asshole in this situation?

I’m excited to share a spicy $26 deck I’ve been brewing: a 5 color, value machine with The Wandering Minstrel at the helm and Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion. It’s been crafted to squeeze out every drop of recursion, synergy, and grindy goodness and while it’s definitely not for the faint of heart, it’s incredibly rewarding to play once the engine is online.

*“What’s a little narrative manipulation among friends?” – The Wandering Minstrel, probably*

Decklist: [https://moxfield.com/decks/KpWjpmix\_EGJdQPgE7cQcw](https://moxfield.com/decks/KpWjpmix_EGJdQPgE7cQcw)

This deck plays like a love letter to value, the gameplan is:

* Run a suite of low-cost sagas that generate incremental advantage
* Use counter removal and proliferation to control how those sagas advance
* Leverage Lurrus to recur your sagas, utility creatures, and cheap interaction
* Eventually go wide with tokens, grind the board to dust, or out-draw everyone with repeated chapter triggers

# Why Only 32 Lands? Yeah, it looks weird. But it works. We run a super-tight land count because:

* We have tons of bounce lands like Azorius Chancery, Simic Growth Chamber, and Izzet Boilerworks that effectively double up our land drops and help fix colors
* Walking Atlas, Pupu Ufo, Azusa’s Many Journeys, and Satyr Wayfinder help us get extra land drops or find them
* Our average mana value is less than 2, but most spells are 2 cmc

As a companion, Lurrus of the Dream-Den is exactly what this deck needs. He lets us replay sagas, removal, and utility creatures. Helps rebuild after wipes or keep the pressure up after trading resources

We’re packing a dense spread of sagas, each offering a unique edge, but all being loopable, abusable, and delicious with Lurrus.

Some MVPs:

* Tribute to Horobi – Chapter I + II make rats, then flips into a flying deathtoucher that lets us draw extra cards every turn.
* Summon: Brynhildr, Teachings of the Kirin, Medomai’s Prophecy, The Modern Age, Binding of the Titans, Invasion of the Giants – cheap, grindy, and cantrip-like value sagas
* Arni Slays the Troll – interaction and ramp
* The Flame of Keld – refuel your hand and chip damage

# Resetting the Clock –> Removing Counters

With the right pieces, we can keep sagas in chapter I or II forever, repeating their best effects every single turn.

Key counter-removers: Vampire Hexmage, Thrull Parasite, Clockspinning, Goldberry, Etched Slith,  Nesting Grounds, O'aka, Traveling Merchant, Garnet, and Princess of Alexandria.

# TLDR

You'll like this deck if you like:  
✅ Fun  
✅ Jank  
✅ Doing weird things

I'm looking to upgrade the steam wand on my De'Longhi ECP 3630. I've been apprehensive of doing the Rancilio steam wand upgrade, as a result of having read about a number of unfortunate experiences. 

I stumbled on the above metal adaptor shown above for the rubber steam nozzle, as a result of a comment under [Eric the Coffee Guy's video on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PY9sn_zQAY). My last post containing the link to this got deleted by Reddit due to a content ban on linking the overseas retail platform listing this product. 

Do you all think that this would be comparable to the Rancilio mod? The goal is to make high quality latte art with the wand - I don't want the equipment to make it any harder for me to do so. Thanks for your time & insight! :)",2,1750395313.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Brace yourselves, basketball enthusiasts! On June 21-22, Seoul’s Shinchon will transform into a 3x3 hoops battleground, hosted by a coalition of government bodies and sponsored by a who’s-who of corporations who probably just want your email. Teams from Spain, China, Japan, Singapore, the U.S., and Korea’s own Yonsei/Dongguk University will clash, proving that even in 3x3, we still can’t escape the “Korean Wave” of academic institutions flexing. Standout players like Gu Seung-chae and Lee Byung-yup will attempt to out-jump gravity, while the real stars might just be the rain contingency plan—moving games to Yonsei’s gym, because nothing says “thrilling competition” like dodging puddles. Stream it live on YouTube, or if you’re cool, record it and wait for KBS N Sports to *finally* air it two weeks later.  

**NC Dinos’ Kim Hwi-jip: Home Run Hero or Just a .233 Joke?**  
In a stunning twist no one saw coming, NC Dinos’ Kim Hwi-jip launched his 9th home run of the season—a 125m moonshot that made LG’s pitcher question his life choices. Manager Lee Ho-jun praised him as part of the “three Kims” future, which sounds less like a dynasty and more like a Korean version of the “Three Musketeers”… if the Musketeers all played third base. Kim’s stats are solid, but let’s be real: his versatility as a utility player means he’s the NBA’s Jimmy Butler and the KBO’s Jimmy Butler in one.  

**Lewin Diaz: KBO’s Home Run Machine or Just a Man with a Chicken Habit?**  
Samsung Lions’ Lewin Diaz is on a tear, with 27 home runs in 71 games—23 of them at home, because apparently, Samsung Lions Park is just a personal slugging playground. He’s on pace to break the foreigner HR record, which Eric Thames probably set while eating kimchi and napping. Team sources gushed about his “desire to play baseball,” which is code for “we didn’t teach him anything; he just loves hitting balls.” If he hits 55 HRs, MLB scouts might finally take note… or just send him a chicken gift card.  

**KBO Challenge: Because Nothing Says “True Fan” Like a 60-Second Video and a Chicken**  
The KBO’s latest genius idea? A hashtag contest where fans film their “true fan moments” for a chance to win All-Star Game tickets or 20,000 KRW in chicken. Because what the world needs more than ever is 10,000 clips of people pretending to catch a foul ball. Deadline? June 30. Prizes? A free meal at a place that serves questionable meat. The real MVP here isn’t Diaz—it’s the chicken.  

**Aksjon Thorsen: Norway’s Fitness Journey or a Six-Month Cry for Help**  
Kristiansund KBK’s sports director, Kjetil Thorsen, is launching a six-month fitness project, and yes, our own Rune Edøy is participating. Because nothing says “team bonding” like a corporate-sponsored fitness plan that probably involves more coffee than cardio. Let’s hope they hit their goals—by “goals,” we mean surviving the summer without a single TikTok about leg day.  

In conclusion: Korea’s sports world is a chaotic, chicken-filled circus where basketball courts double as rain-adjacent arenas, sluggers chase records like they’re late for a meeting, and fans are rewarded with poultry.

We're heading to Kauai in October, already had everything planned out: 7 days in Princeville (Club Wyndham Shearwater) then 5 more days in the Sheraton in Kapa'a. I picked that location since it has a lot of restaurants around, Safeway is also right around the corner and they're all within walking distance (We do have a rental car during this whole trip but just like walking around and exploring things in general). However, I've recently found out that the beach in front of the Sheraton is not a swimming beach which is kinda a bummer because I love having my coffee in the morning by the beach and just jump in for a swim if I want to. So I looked around and found the Hilton Garden Inn Kauai Wailua Bay, it's right next to Lydgate Beach (which is apparently one of the nicer swimming beaches on the island) and for the same kind of room that we're paying now at the Sheraton (King Bed - Ocean View), it's almost $1000 cheaper! However, it is bombarded with terrible reviews - a lot of people say that it's a very dated property and a lot of things don't work. So now I'm kinda apprehensive about booking that hotel.

1lfv6nb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfv6nb,Shanghai International Circuit visit information,"I took a trip out to see the Shanghai international f1 circuit today (June, no GP, just a sunny Friday). There’s very little, if any information available online about it so wanted to provide some guidance here.

Line 11 on the metro goes to the circuit. As line 11 splits, make sure you are on a train destined for Huaqiao and get off at Shanghai Circuit stop. Please be aware, if you are transferring from another metro line onto line 11, the screen showing next train destination might be in Chinese. Try look at the front of the train as it pulls in, and also listen out. They make it very clear with audio announcements, so listen out for Huaqiao.

When you arrive at the metro stop, it doesn’t really matter which side you get out, but faster way and route is on the map I have included. There are no signs for how to access the circuit or where to go outside of race time, but just walk to the right hand side of the back of the grandstands. Again, see purple route in my pic.

If it’s a non race day, the circuit will be a ghost town. The main entrance at the back of the main grandstand will be closed, but on the right hand side is a security entrance and hut for cars. This is the tourist entrance (there are no signs so just trust me). You need to provide your contact and passport info then proceed to the Tourist Centre white sign between A2 and A3. Information relating to a Costa coffee is out of date - there was no such coffee place there, although I think it used to be there.

There are two tours offered. The first is on foot and takes you through the main grandstand, media centre, podium, and a little garage with an f4 car set up. You also get to see the stewards control room (no photos). We couldn’t visit the pitlane as there was AMG testing.


Price was 128RMB for an adult, with a 20rmb discount if a senior. This seems to be a significant increase from previous years and other information available online. However, the experience was worth it in the end.

There is also a slightly more expensive tour run at 10, 1 and 3, which lets you visit a section of the track on a bus, but that wasn’t available to us. 


The walking Tours didn’t have an official time but seem to start every hour and take about 45 min. We arrived 10.15 and had to wait until 11am. Unfortunately, the area you have to wait is completely devoid of any atmosphere. No music, no screen, no memorabilia, no shop, nothing. Just an empty, quiet room that used to be a Costa.

The tour guide spoke only Chinese and the whole tour felt like an inconvenience but he used a translation app to give us some audio information. It was perfect. We had our tour and plenty of chances to take photos.

Overall, despite initial impressions of the soulless waiting area, it was a really good experience, enhanced by the fact that there were some cars going around on track.

Including me, there was only 3 people on the tour.

I’ve even also had people still try to convince/pressure me into drinking it claiming “you will be alright.” Oh and then there’s the typical “I’ve seen people with anxiety drink coffee before and they were fine” comment. 🙃 I try to just politely decline without an explanation when offered to avoid these interactions but they can never seem to just take no for an answer which makes me feel the need to explain myself and then I still end up getting berated for it.

I feel very little. The only real effect I see is slightly decreased obsession with food. 60mg feels no different than 30 mg did. (She did try Vyvanse for 2 months too which felt like nothing as well)

I can take that, drink a coffee, a monster energy drink, and drink Pepsi zero the rest of the day and never do I feel any mental effects. 

Matter of fact, I've developed things I don't like. I have always bitten my nails but now that I've been on Adderall , at night, after it presumably wears off, It is COMPULSIVE. Like I cannot stop for hours. I realize I'm doing it, pull my hands away and next thing I know, without conscious decision, I'm gnawing at them again. When I try to force myself to focus on it and stop I feel restless, and anxious, like I have an itch I can't scratch. 

So my question is, could my body just not be responding to it? Even with all that caffeine and Adderall I don't even ever feel increased heart rate or shaky or anything. At all. 

Others with this experience? And if so did you try a different class like Ritalin or methylphenidate that worked? 

I so badly want to have the effects others describe, the inceased focus and motivation, and although my provider surely will switch my meds when I ask, I don't want to needlessly get my hopes up if others who had no response from Adderall, never found a med that works.

For starters, I feel really lonely. I live in a big city with lots of people, but it feels like I have no one. I don't have any close friends, not really.

I've also been in a situationship for a while now; and while it feels like it's sizzling out, I've definitely caught major feelings for this person. And it sucks because I find myself giving them so much loyalty, knowing that I don't have any loyalty from them.

Yet, I can't bring myself to let them go, and I don't understand why. I so desperately want a relationship, but I want it to be with them. And I can't bring myself to date other people right now. I guess I just feel heartbroken, a little bit. Because I know this isn't going to go anywhere, but every now and then they give me just enough attention to leave me hoping. 

I'm also very unhappy at my job. I went to a liberal arts school (big L for me, I know), and I wasn't able to form close connections or get any experiences to get me into the industry I studied for. After I graduated, I applied for a bunch of jobs, but the only place that hired me was a job that has a lot of physical labor, not related to my degree. And I feel like this place has really taken advantage of me in many ways. Over the years, I've learned to adapt a little bit, but there's no doubt the toll this job has taken on my mental / physical well-being. I've been applying to other jobs the entire time I've worked there, but the only one to hire me was a minimum wage job that took itself too seriously. For a while, I worked both, but it got to be too much, so I quit the minimum wage one. And I guess I feel really stuck right now with where I work. And I work so much.

I also don't really like my living situation. My roommates are okay. I rarely see them. They're quiet and nice, and I've definitely had crazy roommates in the past. But the cleaning situation in our apartment isn't the best. Of course, that can be fixed with communication, so it's not really a big deal. But what really bothers me is the mice problem that we have. Before I moved in, I was told there wasn't a mouse problem –– which *was* my *biggest* concern. But that was very obviously not true. Within my first month of living here, I found so much mouse poop everywhere in the apartment (I don't know how I didn't see it when I first toured the place). I cleaned it all up. Mouse poop would constantly reappear, and I'd bring it up to my roommates. And one of them would sort of make fun of me for being grossed out by the mouse poop, which to me is insane. But I just feel so gross here, I feel like everything is so contaminated, which I don't think is true, but I can't help but feel that way. 

There's also obvious foundation issues in the building, which I also didn't notice right away. But the floors are slanted in half of the apartment (not my half, thank god). Things with wheels will roll down the hall, which is crazy. I've noticed that the walls are shifting slightly, and there's cracks forming –– only one of which is supposedly concerning. The landlord told us that he spoke to an architect (supposedly) who said there is a problem with the foundation, but that it's no concern. I don't believe that, and I am a little worried that the building might collapse at some point, but that might just be me being really paranoid because no one else here seems to be concerned about that.

I also feel like I'm aging horribly. But that's not really something I want to get into. But it does have me feeling insecure and down.

I think another part of it is that I just feel so depressed, and I think that's ultimately what my issue is. I just feel so unfulfilled in so many aspects of my life, and I don't know how to change them. I just wish I had someone that I could hit up and hang out with regularly or just text without it having to be like scheduled, if that makes sense. I know I'm my own problem, so I think the main thing would be to go to therapy and start working on the things I can improve like building my social circle from scratch, maybe, and ditching my situationship and go on actual dates or something. I don't know.

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?
* How do you like spending your time?

1lfuw65,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1lfuw65/please_drink_irresponsibly/,Please drink irresponsibly.,"Woke up this morning stark bollock naked. Maybe that's business as usual for you, but it's extremely unusual for me. I commonly go to bed in jeans or shorts and a t-shirt. I don't like sleeping in the buff; it makes me feel vulnerable. Hell, I've even jumped out of bed, post coitus, just to get dressed for sleep. A legacy of my time on the streets, when I had to get up and go as soon as I woke up, to dodge cops, NIMBY assholes, or other homeless people. In the past decade I've slept naked maybe a handful of times, and at the direction of a woman at that. I certainly wouldn't sleep that way of my own volition, so waking up in my birthday suit was very strange, to say the least.  

Music was playing aloud on my phone. Adagio For Strings. Also weird. 99% of the time when I listen to music I use headphones, even at home alone. I don't like music on speakers. I glance at the time - 05:13. *Why didn't my alarms go off*? I thought maybe I'd slept through them but when I switched to the clock app I found I'd disabled them all last night. Fuuuuuuuck. I have not been sleeping well at all this week, and I've been lowkey worried I'd pull a ""just 10 more minutes..."" act and end up going into a deep sleep for hours, missing work and waking up at like noon. Cold sweat as I realized it was sheer dumb luck I woke up when I did. Thank you, alcoholism, for getting me up on time.


I don't even remember going to bed last night. My memory is foggy. I was talking to a friend from here on the phone, drinking mouthwash and sucking cigarettes, and then....awake. 

Jonesy is at the foot of the bed and as I sit up to pull some shorts on he comes to me with his customary ""good morning"" meow. As I stroke him I see he's wearing his collar. He'd gotten it off somehow, yesterday, and I had made a mental note to find it. He sure as hell didn't put it on himself, but I have no memory of finding it and putting it on him. 

There is a bleeding scratch on my forehead, curiously right opposite the scar from where CAG brained me with that rock. I discovered it when I made to scratch my head and it was sore to the touch. Looking in the mirror next to my bed I could see it oozed a couple of drops of blood down my face. How the fuck did that happen?


I get up and stagger out of the bedroom. The front door of my apartment is ajar. For fuck's sake. The locks are undone, so it's not like someone broke in, saw my snoring, naked, ass in bed and did an about-face. Either I simply didn't lock the door and Jonesy opened it (he can pry it open if it's unlocked and not shut a certain way) or I just left it open. Again, I have no fucking memory of that. I bend down to stroke Jonesy. I thought he'd be out all night - and he might have been, since I can't remember when I even went to bed - but I appreciate he was there with me when I woke up.

I contemplate putting coffee on but decide against it. My brain is sizzling from the mouthwash the night before. It doesn't hit the same as other alcohol; the next day it always feels like your brain is frying, like if there was a sound to how it feels it would be static from an old tv. Coffee is just going to make me feel worse. I pour myself an extract mixer to douse the headache and head out on to the porch for my breakfast cigarette. As soon as I head out the front door I see something in the yard: clothing. It takes a second for my waking brain to connect the dots: it's *my* clothing. Specifically, it's my shirt, trousers, and socks for work, from the day before. What the actual fuck? I go out into the yard and pick up my clothes, thankful that the 20-something couple who moved in last year haven't been home for like a month so aren't gawping at me from their living room window. Clothes are surprisingly not that dirty, considering they've been in the dirt for God knows how long. My shirt is missing some buttons. I'm drawing a blank, memory-wise. Did I tear off my shirt Hulk Hogan-stylee? Did I strip down on the porch, like a madman, and yeet my fucking work clothes into the yard, dancing around with my block and tackle out? I don't know. I don't even fucking remember anything about last night. 

I text my friend and they said I apparently just cut off mid-sentence. That's a fuckin new one for me. Usually it's a gradual descent into blackout, but it must have been like someone flicked a switch and out the lights went. Perpetual ~~motion~~ drunken engine. 

I hadn't even intended to drink this week. Naturally I had some celebratory drinks, in the midst of a dry spell, when I got confirmation of this job - can you blame me? - but I intended to stop with a blowout on Friday night and use the weekend to dry out. WDs were fairly mild over the weekend. Just some very light trembling and the odd craving, but no screaming anxiety and shaking like a leaf. Sunday night rolled around and I watched the clock count down. I had to be in bed early to get up at stupid o'clock - 04:40 - but I had stuff to do, like gathering up my work clothes, making lunch(es) for work, triple-checking I got the bus routes right etc. I have never, *ever*, been good at getting myself to bed early. I'm naturally a night owl and I've always struggled with the 9-5 sleeping pattern and life. I was chronically exhausted throughout school and for most jobs that start early you're only getting like half a day's productivity from me because I'm spending the first half just waking up. 

I hadn't gotten everything done that I needed to get done, as I watched the clock countdown to midnight. Would I be ok with around 5 hours sleep? I'd have to be, as there was nothing to be done for it then. I was actually starting to fall asleep at my desk and felt like I was going to get some restful sleep, but as soon as I climbed into bed my second wind struck. I was wide awake and alert. I rolled around in bed for what felt like forever, waiting for the tiredness to return but it never did. I glanced at my watch - 02:07. Jesus Fucking Christ. It wasn't WDs as I slept like a baby the night before. Maybe it was just nerves about this new job. Either way I was going to be fucked in the morning, and all I could do was pray I didn't sleepily turn off my alarms and roll over to go back to sleep.

05:15. I woke up on my second or third alarm, still tired. I should have gotten up earlier, to mainline the coffee and get myself more fully awake by the time I left the house. Instead, I was rushing around the house, trying to finish off the tasks I'd assigned myself the day before. I was on autopilot and going through the motions; feed Jonesy, change his water, iron shirt, water plants, take supplements, get in shower. That's when I goofed. After toweling off and brushing my teeth I brought the bottle of mouthwash up to my lips, fully intending to use it for its intended purpose. Only, because I was on autopilot and not thinking ~~muscle~~ alco memory took over and I reflexively swallowed about 8 glugs. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I did *not* want to drink, and now I'd just gone and pissed the sober weekend away. For a second I considered ramming two fingers down my throat and making myself puke. *No, you won't get all of it now.* Fuck. I dithered, staring at the bottle for a solid 5 minutes. What to do, what to do? Had I had only maybe 1 or 2 glugs I might have been fine just going about my day, but I could already see and feel it hitting my system: pressure around the eyes, pupils dilating, cheeks reddening, a building buzz. I wouldn't be able to just walk this off; kindling meant I'd be swan diving right into horrible withdrawals on my first day of work. Fucking great. I made the decision to drink more of the shit then. Rather than tickle my thirst and crash into WDs early on in the day, I'd get sauced enough that hopefully my BAC would remain high enough, throughout the day, that I didn't have to worry about WDs until near the end of work. I poured a little of the mouthwash into some empty shooter bottles to take with me, just in case.

Something really quite wonderful happened on my commute in. Because of fucking around with the mouthwash, and needing to get changed because I forgot I burned a hole in one of my pairs of work trousers, I was running a bit late. I was hoofing it as best as I could, but I got the dreaded sensation I wasn't going to make it to the bus stop on time, at the rate I was going. I don't have money for a Lyft, and I couldn't miss that bus because the next one wouldn't be for another 30 minutes so, out of nowhere, the thought just bubbled up out of the mire of my mouthwash-tinged thoughts: *run*. 

I used to be a runner. I used to love running. I got into running a couple of years before I fell in the drink, when it was measured and healthy. Then when I started CA drinking mania took over and I was HIIT running 2-4 hours literally every day. I would get agitated as fuck if I couldn't run for whatever reason. Back in those heady days I had the self-discipline to not drink until I was done with the day's exercise but as the drink took over the running stopped, because what is runner's high compared to the medicinal numb of the sauce? I had hoped to take up running again; I just had to get some dry time under my belt. Arizona has the perfect climate for night running; in England I loved running in the summer, but the colder nights of spring, autumn, and winter had my lungs feeling like I was breathing fire when I was done with a run. I remember thinking, back then, *what if I lived somewhere warmer*? 

Then I lost my hip. Post-op, that was the burning question for me and I asked the doctor ""will I be able to run again?"" She made a face and said *no*. She laid out high-impact exercises such as running will shorten the lifespan of the artificial joint, and could even dislodge it. ""Oh you'll know if you do that,"" she said, ""you won't be able to walk properly, it will be pain like you've never felt, and you'd need surgery again."" I was crushed. I had it on the back burner as something to eventually do in time, but now that door was firmly closed for me.

Physically, I can still run; there's nothing stopping me. I have run for the bus before, or run out to a Lyft so as not to keep them waiting. But it's a weird shuffle-run where I sort of hobble because I take it easy on the leg with the replacement hip joint. Monday morning, though, I didn't hold back. I *had* to make it for that bus or I could just take my happy ass back home, drink some mouthwash until I passed out, then look forward to homelessness. Buoyed by that mouthwash high, I didn't have to time to think; I just *ran*. I didn't nurse the leg, I didn't even think about the hip replacement. I just ran like I used to, and it was *glorious*. My leg and hip felt fine as I gave it my all and sprinted down the street. I expected to feel pain, or some kind of *off* sensation as the impacts of my footfalls traveled up to the artificial hip, but I felt fine; good, even. I made it to the bus stop in good time and I was buzzing. It felt good to run, after all those years. 

Work was a piece of piss. I won't bore you with the minutiae of what I do, but suffice it to say it's *extremely* monotonous. Boring, really. 5 minutes of 'training', if that, and off we went. Large office, plenty of space between us all. Little office drones doing their thing in silence. 

That first day flew by. I wanted to make sure I was doing everything right, and working hard, even though we had no KPIs or any sort of expectation of how much we were required to do in an hour or day. Two cigarette breaks, and I skipped lunch. The last time I was drinking I went a solid 11 days without eating any food. Not like my usual alcorexia where I dodge 'proper' meals but still sometimes indulge in snacks; in those 11 days I didn't even eat so much as a peanut, and only eventually forced myself to eat some tinned collard greens (over the course of 4 days, at that) when I woke up one day, my *entire body* felt like it was bruised, and just touching my own skin was painful. It was easy for me to just fall back into that food-avoidant mode again.

I carried on drinking when I got home. I couldn't just stop then. Unlike folks here who waltz into the work place on a Monday, in full WDs after a weekend of boozing, I would collapse into a quivering mess if someone so much as looked at me when I'm withdrawing. My anxiety is top-tier and there have been occasions in the past when, walking to the liquor store for more fuel to stave off WDs, I've had to just stop walking and pretend to play with my phone because I've had the overwhelming sensation I was going to fall over sideways because I felt like someone on the other side of the street was watching me and judging me. Workplace environment, I can imagine standing up from my chair, thinking one or more people are looking at me, and just immediately falling over backwards. I feel incredibly wobbly, *precarious*, if I feel like someone is watching and judging me. It's like when your tremors get worse when you have to swipe that debit card for your AM booze, only 10 times worse. My sense of balance just evaporates and my brain screams *you're going to topple over*. Legs turn to jelly. I'm not eager to test the limits of that in public in case my body makes good on its threat and I simply fall over, pole-axed, because someone glanced at me.

Sleep has not been good since. We all know CA sleep is poor quality sleep, but something's going on here. Maybe it's because I'm maintaining on mouthwash and extract mixers, but it feels like my body is just not logging any sleeping hours at all. Tuesday, Wednesday, today - I've woken up feeling even more tired than the day before. As I said, I've been worried the sleep debt gets too high and I, more than a little bit drunk from the night before, just stop my phone from warbling and roll over and fall back into a deep sleep. I've been falling asleep at my desk. Not head in the crook of your arm asleep, but microsleeps. Eyelids get heavy, head starts to droop a little, eye closed for a minute, leaning forward in my seat a little. Then I'll jerk awake and nervously look around, in case anyone saw me dozing off. It's a large office, far larger than for our numbers, and there's no one sat close to me so I have plenty of space and privacy, but there's a camera above and in front of my desk, and I can't shake the paranoia some higher up is watching me fall asleep. 

To compound the sleepiness problem, I have another issue: random boners. I don't know if it's CA or not, but I remember discovering this phenomenon back in 2018 when I had been sober for a little while: if I'm sleep-deprived, to such a degree I start falling asleep in circumstances I normally wouldn't, and I try to fight it, I get raging hard-ons. It's like my body says *we must sleep now*, my mind says *we can't sleep now*, and my dick says *HEY YOU GUYYYSSSS!* End result: it doesn't matter how much coffee I've had in the morning, it doesn't matter how I've tried to measure the morning mouthwash such that it only wards away WDs but doesn't get me wasted; an hour or two into work I'm mouth-open drooling, eyes rolling into the back of my head, and pitching a tent at my desk. I've had to lower my chair as far as it can go, to roll under my desk for, um, discretion. Almost had a workplace 'incident' the other day when I thought a manager was calling me from a couple of banks of desks away, I turned around in my seat to respond, and she was actually right next to me (we have to wear headphones to listen to something for work) and my face ended up like 4 inches away from her heaving cleavage. That would have been awkward. ""Yes, I'm brandishing an erection here, but it's not because of you, it's because I'm trying to fight sleep deprivation. You're not a bad-looking lass and I'm sure you're a nice person, but you can't take credit for this tent."" Shit's embarrassing. I have to cross my legs awkwardly if a manager comes over, or turn to face a wall if I'm passing someone in a corridor.

Fast-forward to today. After talking to another CA friend on the phone this morning (I really need to rename my phone Del_Mod's Home For Wayward Girls) I had to sprint for the fucking bus again. While it might have felt good on Monday, I was a little bit more realistically-minded today and thought of the doctor's words about the joint just *disconnecting* if I went all Usain Bolt. I took it too hard this morning. I didn't pace myself because I was simultaneously talking to a trashed CA, trying to feed Jonesy, and getting myself a sandwich made for work. Add to that the rolling sleep deprivation - I think I've had 9 hours total since Sunday - and I was falling asleep on the bus. I almost missed my stop and it's only because the driver stopped suddenly that I was jerked awake. I get to the general vicinity of work like 40 minutes early, and I normally just drag my heels, listen to music, sit outside work, and smoke some smokes, before trudging in. But today I overloaded on the breakfast booze and was already feeling schnarfy before I got off the bus. There's a stop I normally rest at, for some discreet drinking and to put on my work shirt and shoes, but this morning I just thought *God, I'm fucking exhausted* and curled up on my side to pass out on the bus stop bench. I dozed off for maybe a solid 20 minutes before I woke up because some normies came into the stop to actually wait for the bus.

Work was a fucking shit show today. As soon as I sat down at my desk I realized the extract mixer and DIY electrolyte drink I had made this morning I left on the kitchen counter, in my rush to get out and get to the bus. I tried to be productive and get my head into the game, but the usual result came around - I was falling asleep at my desk with a raging hard-on. I'm trying to be grateful for this job; I'm trying to be mindful of the fact that it keeps a roof over mine and Jonesy's heads, but one of the managers even said it on day one: 'it's extremely boring, but at least it's decent pay."" She was right. It's extremely fucking boring. I'm looking for something that only happens .0000001% of the time. I would say it's a job that shouldn't even exist, and AI could do it, but AI can't reliably detect human bullshit. I made a sandwich for work today and I ended up eating that at like 10:00 out of sheer boredom. It tasted of bland CA food-avoidance but I was that bored I scoffed it anyway just to pass the time.

The mouthwash caught up with my ass. First couple of days I was fine, but you can only hide from the explosive shits for so long before ""Chocolate Rain"" becomes your anthem. There are a couple of other men in my group and I observed on day one they take 'tactical' toilet breaks like I do. 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes here and there to pass the time. Sometimes it's annoying as fuck when I go in the bathroom for a strategic shit or time-wasting wank and I see telltale shoes visible like ""oh Jimmy, you rascal; it was my turn on the throne!"" but today I just wasn't having any of that nonsense. My stomach sounded like a dying bear after a drink of coffee or water - I'd be sat type, type, typing away and then suddenly *mrrrrrroooowwwwwn*. I'd have to jump out of my seat and dash to the bathroom. Pure blue/green fluid. I thought I could put it off, earlier today, until the dying bear sounds wouldn't stop, so I dashed to the bathroom. Fucking heaving, like all the men in the office were just hanging out in there. Fucking football dash, elbow out in front of me, as I barged through the crowd ""scuse me, scuse me, sorry, watch it, scuse me, sorry, comin through"" and made a beeline for the disabled toilet stall. Fucking dropped my guts and I swear down I heard the guy hiding in the next stall mutter ""*god damn*"". 

I should have taken that mixed drink into work with me. I needed it. After the post-lunch hump I could see my hands visibly trembling as I concentrated trying to write things on paper. I felt like I was in kindergarten, needing to default to capital letters because my shorthand looked like shit. I could feel the anxiety compounding as the hours went on, to such a degree when I was in the final 30 minute stretch time just *dilated*. I would glance at the clock thinking ""surely 45 minutes have passed by now!"" and it was....3 minutes gone. My leg was rocking nervously under my desk. I wanted out of there. I wanted home. I wanted sauce. I needed it. I watch the clock on the screen flick over from 3:58 to 3:59. I want to scream *fucking come onnnnnn!* My mouth is suddenly very dry. Clocking out rolls around. My God, 30 minutes felt like 4 hours. I put on my casual shoes and start undoing my work shirt. First day I walked to the bus stop, and thence home, in an office shirt. 112°F so I was fucking sodden by the time I walked through my front door. I've since gone to and from work in a tank top to keep the heat down. Like the world's shittiest Superman I dip into the work bathroom on the way out and strip down, coming out in my wife beater and sneakers for the charge home.

I'm in full withdrawals by the time I exit the building. Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I should have brought that mixer in with me, as I intended. I wobble my way home, feeling the seethe build. I can't look passing drivers int the eye without snarling. I cross a busy lane and feel the anxiety spike - I fucking **hate** crossing the road in Tucson. Nowhere else I've lived - not even Manila - have I ever felt as unsafe crossing the road as I do here. So many near-misses when I had right of way and car drivers are only looking out for other vehicles as they obliviously turn into an intersection I'm halfway through crossing. So many times I've almost been splattered and I get a sheepish four fingers up and a grin like ""oops, sorry, didn't see you there hehe!"" Watch where you're going, you stupid fuck. I wait until the lights go red, traffic fully stops, crosswalk lights up 'go', and I'm *still* constantly looking this way and that because I just don't trust the drivers in this city, who are some of the worst in the country. 

The walk home, or the walk to the bus home to be more accurate, is a trip down memory lane. My work place now is actually down the road from my old work place. Sometimes, when I wander in in the morning, I've wondered if Carmen and the like have driven past and I was the office gossip for the morning. ""Hey, remember that one weirdo, Del Mod? I think he's homeless now. I just saw him wandering around a few blocks down."" I see shops and restaurants I haven't seen since 2021. Some of them I used to earmark, thinking it might be fun if CAG and I went, back when I foolishly thought she was loyal. It's strange seeing some of these places closed down now, or knowing she's had such a shit fit I will possibly never speak to her again.

I was lucky that on my second ride home there was no one else waiting at the stop. I felt my heart dip as the first bus passed perpendicular and I saw my connecting bus pass and go. I'd have to wait another 30 minutes for a stupid bus, and because I was in full on WDs 30 minutes felt like 30 hours. It didn't help that with this particular bus stop it was sun-facing so the bench was absolutely scorching hot and I couldn't sit down and just zone the fuck out until the bus came. Had to pace up and down, sucking cigarettes, mean-mugging people in their cars in the local shit-food parking lot. Don't look at me, don't judge me.

Bus home finally comes and I just melt into my seat. Sweet relief is just 40, 30, 20, 15 minutes away. I practically run home when I get off at my stop. Jonesy is waiting at the top of the fridge, where it's cool, and my mixer from that morning is still on the counter top. I pick up Jones and hug him and kiss him because it's good to be home, and that mixer just dispels the screaming anxiety that had been building for a few hours. It's good to be back. Chairs, ma lovelies.

ICE raids, fear tactics, rights being chipped away. Our brains are fried. Our bodies are tired. And yet we’re still expected to clock in, show up, and act like everything is fine.

The fact that people are staying silent and we’re expected to keep doing our jobs like nothing is happening is absolutely insane.

Protests get twisted. We’ve seen it. They send provocateurs into peaceful actions just to flip the narrative. So maybe the most effective thing left is a silent protest. A full stop to participating in the system.

Don’t go to games where agents are waiting to kidnap our friends. Don’t line up at a corporate coffee shop where your money is funding wars overseas. Don’t shop the big brands. If you can, take a week off. Use mental health leave if you’re in corporate. Support your local small businesses if needed but otherwise pause. Lean on your community. Rest. Reset.

A week of stillness would speak volumes. Imagine what it would look like if LA simply stopped.
