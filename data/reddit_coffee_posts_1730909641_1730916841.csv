I'm David, and I've been working as a writing professor for the past six years here in California. I started pretty early, which was a wild ride--and it still is--but it truly is the best job in the world. Other things I enjoy doing are reading, writing, listening to music, playing music, playing volleyball, working out, drinking coffee, watching a movie, playing video games, traveling, cooking, learning something new, or a mix of any of those.

I absolutely love good stories regardless of where they're found, which expands to enjoying meeting and talking to people. When I'm not teaching, I'm talking to students before and after class (often risking being late to my next class!) or meeting with students both current and former and talking about writing, life, and everything in between. It's a lot for an introvert like me, but I'm awful at saying no, and it is one of the aspects I enjoy most about the job.

That's enough about me. I'm trying to keep this shorter than my usual posts, which apparently is a struggle for me. I want to know about you! There's something to be appreciated about the raw honesty and vulnerability of meeting strangers online, so come say hi!

I played football in middle school and decided it wasn’t for me.  I joined cheerleading in high school because all my friends were trying out, and I fell in love with the sport.  I later found love for competitive cheer.  Fast forward to this year I now have a job as a competitive cheer coach and im also on a team at the gym I coach at too.  We recently had our annual showcase where all the teams show off their routines to their friends and family.  Because it’s my first year I am coaching the kids that are the youngest and most new to cheerleading.  The way the showcase works is the lower level teams go first and higher levels go towards the end.  The showcase is about 2.5hrs with a 30 minute intermission.  My kids performed at 12:20 while the team that I am on performed at 2:00.  Here is where the issue came.  My family has never been good with time, especially my mother.  I told them about this showcase over a month in advance and even reminded them the morning of.  The show started at 12:00, and doors opened at 11:45.  We live about 15 minutes away from where the showcase was, so I told them to leave at 11:30 and be there by 11:45.  Fast forward to 12:15 and they still haven’t shown.  I wanted my family there because even though they do stuff like this and are often late I still considered them my support group.  My kids perform and they do awesome, but my family wasn’t there. 12:45 comes and they finally walk into the gym.  The second I saw them, I had to excuse myself to go to the restroom because I was so mad.  They tried to come up to me and say hi but I brushed them off.  My mom was texting me and saying things like “it wasn’t her fault”, “they left the house by 11:50 was parked by 12:10”, “there were a lot of places on campus I got lost.”  She also lied and said she saw a part of the kids routine from the window, which is a complete and utter lie because the doors were closed when my kids went on.  When the showcase was over and I confront my family about it I start getting the truth out of them.  I checked their Life360 and found out they left the house at 12:15 and got to the parking lot by 12:40 because they stopped for coffee.  When I confronted them about this, they just ignored it.  I cried and told them how much it meant for me to have them there to see this as my first year of coaching and how disrespected I felt that they came an hour late to an event I told them about over a month ago.  They told me that more important stuff was happening in the world and people are dying and I shouldn’t be upset over a little cheerleading event.  I understand that other stuff is happening in the world, but to me cheerleading is MY WORLD.  This sport has provided me with so many friends and opportunities, and I wouldn’t not be a fraction of the person I am today without it.

1gl4rtj,https://i.redd.it/pha868tombzd1.jpeg, 6 weird and disturbing facts about Donald Trump's personality .,""" i took this content from an older post , originally written by Jannet Allon, Altor Net "". 

1.HE HAS NEVER DONE DRUGS.

Trump has never smoked a cigarette or had an alcoholic drink. 
Trump has said the alcoholism and early death of his older brother turned him into a life-long teetotaler, and maybe that is true. He won’t even have a cup of coffee

He has also said in many interviews that his biggest piece of advice for his kids when they were growing up was not to do drugs.

Of course, Trump has tried to cash in on other people’s drinking habits with Trump vodka, which failed.

2. HE’S A GERMOPHOBE IN THE EXTREME.

Trump has called the practice of shaking hands “barbaric."" He won’t shake hands with his children’s teachers because teachers are in touch with too many germy kids. Then again, it’s hard to imagine he has attended too many parent-teacher conferences.

His germophobia is such that he is unwilling to push ground-floor elevator buttons because they have been touched by too many people (the masses).

Perhaps on the belief that it distances him from germs, he drinks with a straw and eats pizza with a fork.
He has spoken about how he loves to wash his hands, and does it as much as possible.
He has openly boasted about never changing a diaper on any of his five kids, probably as a result of his germophobia, plus sexism and wealth.

3. WHEN HE DOES SHAKE HANDS , HE DOES IT IN A VERY WEIRD WAY.

Whenever possible, Trump avoids shaking hands. When he absolutely has to shake someone's hand, he has a weird habit of aggressively pulling the person in close to him, so that the person practically has to hug him. When the fellow offers any resistance, the whole dance can become a fairly awkward arm-wrestling match.

4. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY PETS. 

Trump is the first president in the hIstory of America not to have a pet, if you count James Polk’s horses. It does not even appear that Trump likes animals much.

He has been publicly criticized by the Humane Society of the United States for having cozy relationships with anti-animal welfare zealots who rake in profits from puppy mills, agribusiness, trophy hunting, factory farming, and horse slaughterhouses.

Being a self-confessed clean-hands freak and Germophobia , may be part of the reason Trump dislikes animals.

5. HE HAS BIZARRE IDEAS ABOUT EXERCISE AND SLEEP.

The fast-food-loving germophobe-in-chief also has some notion that exercise is bad for you. This may be based on his theory that the human body is like a battery, and if you use up the energy it’s all gone, .

Trump also seems to think that needing sleep shows weakness, and claims only to sleep three or four hours a night, which leaves him plenty of time to tweet at people who have affronted him.

“I’m a guy who lies awake and thinks and plots,” he told New York magazine in 1992, somewhat terrifyingly. Among the things he likes to plot, he said, are revenge strategies. Adequate sleep is tied to mental health, and what Trump expressed smacks more than a little of paranoid tendencies, ..

6. THE SUIT THING.

Trump is never seen in anything but a suit. suit is fitting attire for a businessman, but he reportedly also violently demanded that his son wear a suit to a baseball game by one account.

I was excited to go, this would be my first time in Asia, I've always dreamed of going to Japan. It was amazing, beyond expectations. 

Biggest tips up front: 

\> get a e-sim on your phone, I used **ubigi**, it was amazing to not worry about data etc and being able to adjust the amount I had, use maps as much as I wanted, google things etc. I can travel light on data usage other places but not here, also maybe get a japan money card at one of the kiosks right off, u can use it for all travel and for the shinkansen app (usa cards dont work) + at vending machines, **suica or pasmo** u can add to your apple wallet and fill them up as needed -- u do not need to book shinkansen tickets ahead of time, but the machines and options can be tricky, i wish i had used the app more but my usa card didnt work so i gave up-- i think i could have used my suica in retrospect?

\>dont stress about seeing x,y,z if it's your first time in japan? for me the things i enjoyed most were just out of the way things, wandering kinda empty streets, eating, seeing-- i can't at all relate to the people who needed to see every temple, go to big theme parks, etc. also japan is soo convenient i would have worried about so many less things leading up to this trip, u can find anything anywhere all the time almost-- laundry was super easy > i wish i had brought a slip on outdoor shoe though, taking lace up shoes on and off so much was frustrating, some birkenstock clogs woulda been incredible

  
Itinerary --

Oct 15 fly from Paris to Seoul (i flew into seoul bc my boyfriend studied for 1 year there so he kinda insisted i check it out, also, direct flights on airlines i wanted at the time i looked were round trip $900 i think for seoul and about $1400 for tokyo)

Oct 16, 17 I explored Seoul 

Oct 18 Fly into **Nagoya** in morning, meet a childhood friend living there working for Toyota, drive 3hrs to Norikura - Kogen for 2 nights in a ryokan, Hirayu No Mori, it was around $500 for 2 of us for 2 nights, in a super nice traditional room that had western style thick mattresses and fluffly pillow/comforter, which after 2 nights kinda partying in Seoul I needed this badly, the onsen that first night + the ryokan dinner buffet had me in tears of joy

Oct 19 it was rainy this day, with a little sun inbetween but we hikes all around **Norikura-Kogen** this day, a bunch of small hikes, a few ponds/waterfalls all super accessible and just walking one-to-another, we had wild chai lattes(which we could smell a lot hiking) at a cute cafe called Kurumu, and some pumpkin cake, got a few cermaics here for gifts, i had gotten stung by a wasp or hornet on the trail and the girl working here was so helpful to give me a like suction thing and alcohol to treat it -- we had an amazing lunch at Cafe Maple and took a bus up to the top of the mountain, went back for onsen time, and had dinner at a ramen bar walking distance from the ryokan -- it was such an excellent first day in japan, and maybe one of my favorites of the whole trip-- i loved this place so much

Oct 20 we went to **Kamikochi** via a super easy shuttle bus across from the ryokan, saw monkeys on the road on the way, had breakfast at a fancy hotel near the bus stop-- hiked in a few hours, gorgeous views everyhere-- lots of people here compared to norikura though, more touristy-- had lunch at a little place in the woods along the trail that had fish being trapped from the river and cooked over charcoal all right there, delicious and easy -- drove back to Nagoya stopping at the **Shirahone** public onsen, which was on kinda a cliff, and very local and beautiful 

Oct 21 & Oct 22 I just explored **Nagoya** alone as my friend went to work & we had dinner together, I LOVED Nagoya, it wasn't touristy at all, was a bit she-she in a good way, had incredible food & vintage shopping around the Osu area, we had Maze Soba, conveyer belt sushi, an incredible teppanyaki at 鉄板ダイニング藤彩, one of my best meals, also being up early every morning and having incredible filter iced coffee and red beans on toast, anywhere u wanted u could have this 'coffee service' was such a treat

Oct 23 Apa **Asakusa** Ekime

I regretted staying here, everything before this felt quite special and perfect, and here was just rough, i chose this area because i wanted to maximize tokyo and thought, hey, i can just up early, see the temple, explore this neighborhood and move on-- the hotel had no real window, kinda opened directly onto a shaft but like no light + a smell from the restaurant below-- also this neighborhood was lively at night but very filled with tourists and touristy places-- and dead before 11am, no coffee even besides like starbucks chains or konbinis-- this was my least favorite part of my trip, i was just sweaty and stressed

Oct 24 Citadines **Shinjuku** 

2nd least favorite part, i think i coulda just visited shibuya once and moved on, didn't need to stay here, this hotel was directly on the path of the big tough guys trying to get you to buy hookers or go in their clubs, i spent the day trying to find a dry cleaner for my suit for the wedding and just walking around the neighborhood-- it was soo hot and muggy out, i got to see the iconic tokyo streets i had in my head, visiting the **Omotesando** area was a highlight

Oct 25, 26, 27, 28 **Shibuya Ebisu** Graphy Inn

loved this area, good mix of nearby things without being too in the center of it, i was maybe a 15 min walk from shibuya station?? but i spent these days exploring **Nakameguro** & **Shimo-Kitazawa** area and inbetween, these were my favorite parts of Tokyo, it was exactly what I wanted from the city-- I got to see the Meji shrine both as a tourist and seeing my friends wedding there, magical, visit the Marquis Maeda teahouse, lots of cute shops + coffee + snacks all around these neighborhoods, this healed me from the Shinjuku/Asakusa touristy days that made me wonder if I hated tokyo??

Oct 29 **Kyoto** Dormy Inn

This hotel was amazing, I think it was $80 a night, the rooftop onsen was huge and incredible, i loved being so close to the shinkansen, i could walk most places, I visited the Eikando temple (a little out of the way, so serene not too busy) + the botanical gardens & Imperial palace, it was again a little misty out so i think i dodged some crowds, though walking through Sannenzaka at night was wildly busy-- I did fushimi inari at dusk and it was beautiful, hiked to the top to avoid crowds a little, saw a crane on the pond-- in the end i wish i stayed here a little longer, but, also felt i saw it in the best way and got to be in and out

Oct 30 **Nara**

So the trains from Kyoto to Nara were messed up this day, not sure why, what should have taken like 40 mins took 2 hours, both ways, it was amazing to see all the deer, something i'd dreamed of doing, though it was very touristy at the bottom, and just sooo many people being a bit disrespectful maybe-- i walked far up and saw some beautiful shrines and peaceful bits of forest though, if the trains hadn't been a mess it would have been great, but, i was missing kyoto a little i would have been happier doing this as a half day than spending a full on it

Oct 31 **Nagoya** 

this was to recharge a bit, see my friend, have a quiet dinner and go out a bit for halloween, i was shocked how many japanese teenagers were going all out for halloween-- amazing costumes etc. it was fun to be back in this city that i felt i knew my way around etc.

Nov 1, 2 **Osaka**

this was the perfect end to my trip, a friday night in osaka, i stayed at the HUGE apa hotel, which, beyond the check in sucking, getting your luggage etc taking forever because there were something like 30 floors of rooms, the onsen was great and having a lawsons inside was cool-- my room had a nice view-- i walked all around, dotonbori canal, markets side streets malls-- recharged at the onsen then went out drinking-- i had some of my favorite food here, 2 very local vibe places i didn't save but one that was just grilling pork wrapped things like different vegatables i had red pickled ginger wrapped in pork grilled it was insane, the streets at night were so so beautiful, it was like being in blade runner but also reminded me of home (nyc) some times-- i went out drinking, needed to extend my (stupid) 10am apa checkout 2x but it was all worth it, my flight was 4pm

1gl4noa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gl4noa/time_looped_chapter_18/,Time Looped (Chapter 18),"Will watched as his friend shattered before his very eyes. Helen had done a good job arriving at the scene in record time, though too good of a job as far as Alex was concerned. The expression of determined vengefulness on her face made the boy glad they were on the same side.

*Knights really do fight well,* he thought.

“Are you okay?” the girl asked.

Given what just had occurred one would think that a small crowd would have started to gather. At least someone should have noticed a girl leaping over a school fence and shattering a boy to fragments of glass. And yet, no one did. People continued to honk, rushing off to some place or other. A local shop worker gave the car lot a general glance, then returned to getting things ready for the day.

“Yeah.” Will tried to move off the spot he was standing. The mirror tile kept on holding him tight.

As he was hesitating whether to try and smash it or not, Helen approached and did just that. On cue, he no longer felt stuck.

“Thanks.” He stepped away. “You got here fast.”

“I’m good at gymnastics,” the girl said, looking at where Alex had been. By now, the glass fragments had all but evaporated as if they had never been.

“Seen anything like this before?”

The girl shook her head. “Are you sure it was Alex?” she asked. “I mean, this wasn’t him, but are you sure he’s the one?”

“Yep.” Will walked up to the mirror pole and tapped it with his hand.

 

**The class has already been found by someone else. Next time, try sooner.**

 

The familiar message appeared on it.

“See?”

“He must have learned some trick.” The boy looked at the ground again. “Or more than a few tricks.”

During his brief speech, the goofball had given Will the impression he had been at this far longer than either of them, possibly even longer than Danny. Catching him was going to be difficult, although Will had gained one huge advantage: he’d found the location of the starting mirror. Still, there was something that didn’t add up.

“Want some mousse?” he turned to the girl.

“What?”

“Chocolate mousse. I know a place.”

Helen tilted her head, arms crossed.

“We’ve got six minutes till the next loop. After what just happened I don't feel like going to class. Why not use the time to chill a bit in a coffee shop?”

The chances of such an offer being accepted were a hundred to one. If this were a date, or there was a chance that it seemed like a date, he’d never be so straightforward. Since it was loop related, and there were only a few minutes left, Will wasn’t going to feel particularly bad if he were shot down.

On her part, Helen, would normally never accept such an invitation. Everything else aside, she liked to know where she’d be going and gathered a few second-hand opinions of the place first. Going to a random coffee shop that served “chocolate mousse” was without question not it. And yet only a minute later both of them were sitting inside, taking advantage of the place’s cocoa.

“Are you sure you’re supposed to be here?” the barista asked with a note of suspicion. “Isn’t it a school day or—”

“First period teacher got stuck in traffic,” Helen interrupted without batting an eye. “We thought we’d go somewhere special.”

“Ah.” The barista nodded, as if the answer made anything clear. “Right. I’ll go check the inventory.” He gave them a sly nod, then discretely wandered off.

“How fast can you get to the parking lot?” Will asked, the moment they were let alone, doing his best to ignore what she had insinuated just then.

“Running, jumping out of windows… ten-fifteen seconds. It’s not that far if you follow a straight line.” She took a sip of her drink. “Straightish.”

“Even after getting the knight?”

“It takes me less than a second to get the knight. I’m already in the bathroom, remember? Wasn’t like that when Daniel was alive. Then, it sometimes took me half a minute.”

“You never said that.”

“Well, excuse me for not discussing things relating to a dead close friend. He wasn’t supposed to die, either.”

Will had an inkling of how she felt, but even so had hoped she’d share such important things. So, a looped’s death caused eternity to change. It sort of sounded logical.

“When you became a rogue, you pulled the loop forward. At least for me. Of course, I did the same thing I did every morning.”

“Get to the mirror and get your class,” the boy said along with her. “That means Alex will be in front of his mirror too.”

There went the idea of catching the goofball by surprise. Still, it was possible to make things uncomfortable for him. It would take Helen fifteen seconds to get there. With a bit of running, Will could reach the spot as well from the other side. Some testing would be required to tell whether it would be faster to get his rogue class first or run directly to the mirror. Either way, it would put pressure on Alex.

“So, that’s your big plan?” The girl didn’t look at all impressed.

“Of course not,” the boy lied. “We know where he starts. We know where he has to be to get Danny’s file—”

“Not that it will do us any good,” Helen uttered beneath her breath.

“We know that…” the boy paused. “A class has three skills, right?”

“Pretty much.”

“I’m serious. Are there any with more?”

“Not that I know of. Daniel said that all the classes were front heavy and started with three at most.”

“Then it’s impossible.”

The girl narrowed her eyes.

“I mean Alex,” the boy continued. “I know one of his skills is to make him faster. I saw that when I chased after the archer. I also know that he can create traps, and we saw that he can make copies of himself.”

“That makes three.”

“How come no one sees him?” Will leaned back triumphantly. “Even if he has a mirror copy of him rushing off to get Danny’s files, how does he get both copies without being seen or raising the alarm? You tried breaking into June’s office. How did that go?”

“Invisibility…” the girl said.

“And lock picking.”

“Please. That’s child’s play. Anyone can pick a lock with a basic set of tools. Daniel taught me how.”

“I still doubt it, but okay. That still makes four skills, which—” the boy raised a finger “—he must have *before* getting to the nurse’s mirror. Otherwise, she’d have seen him as well.” He grabbed his phone from his pocket and started typing a text. “Danny said that there were only four classes at the school, right?”

“Yeah, but he didn’t say anything about outside. There could be more. The parking lot isn’t part of the school either.”

That was true. It was possible that he’d taken a class from elsewhere. If so, that might complicate Will’s plan a bit.

Helen leaned closer to see what he was typing, but the angle remained uncomfortable.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

“I’m texting to Alex. If all goes well, we might not have to fight after all.” The message sent, he put the phone on the table. “We’ll still have to be ready, though. Just in case.”

The girl took the phone. The text read: *Talk after 1 period* , followed by a mirror and hand emoji.

“Mirror and hand?” The girl looked at him.

“Or we’ll break your mirror.”

It wasn’t a very realistic threat, especially considering the nature of the mirror in question. Still, it was a clear threat that they were going to make life difficult for Alex in every loop moving on. The only question was, whether he’d believe them.

With less than a minute left to the end of the loop, the barista returned to check if they wanted anything else. Despite his reluctance, Will ordered a chocolate mousse, telling Helen she had to try it. Before she had the chance, however…

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Another loop, another rush through the bathroom. Will didn’t pause to wait for Alex or the daily insult coming from the pair of girls. Getting the rogue right off, he went to the art classroom. Helen was already there, as usual, opening the windows. Silently, the boy assisted, then sat at Daniel’s desk.

One by one, the rest of the class started to arrive. Everyone did the exact same things they had been doing for hundreds of loops. The same jokes, coughs, and nasty comments. Students went to the same places asking the same questions to receive the same answers. In his mind, Will often finished the conversations for them, seconds before they had a chance to do it. Then, something different happened. When the jocks came in, they no longer did so with their usual yell. In fact, they were rather quiet, discussing football strategies. Jace didn’t even pay attention to Will, joining the rest of the group at their desks.

*Huh?* Will thought.

After experiencing the same things so many times, he almost wanted to go to them and start a fight himself. It wasn’t even about extending the loop—he knew precisely what actions he had to do in order to achieve that—but rather out of a sense of tradition.

As for the goofball, there was no notable difference. Ever since he had been discovered, Alex had stopped coming to class, doing his thing elsewhere.

Eight o’clock. The bell rang marking the start of class.

The teacher, barely arrived, told the class to prepare their drawing materials—as he did each loop—then went to close the nearest window. Unexpectedly, the door opened once more. Everyone turned in its direction only to see their very own goofy classmate standing there, carrying a large paper bag of something.

“Should I even ask?” The teacher sighed as his glance fell on the bag Alex was carrying.

“It’s fire, teach!” The boy reached in and took out a muffin. “Muffins, the progressive nature morte!”

The entire class erupted in laughter. Even the teacher found it difficult to remain indifferent. Despite all his other faults, and Will could think of several since the recent revelation, the goofball remained highly amusing.

“While I’m impressed you know the phrase, muffins can hardly be described as a nature morte,” the teacher said once calm was restored.

“But, they’re lit. And I brought enough for everyone.”

“Great. I’m sure your classmates would appreciate that… after class. Until then please put the bag on my desk where it won’t serve as a drawing inspiration.”

Alex shrugged, returned the muffin to the rest, folded the top of the paper bag, then placed it on the teacher’s desk. A few rogue comments followed from other members of class, all attempting to match his humor and failing at it. That didn’t disturb the boy in the least. In his usual swagger, he went straight to Will’s old desk and sat down.

“Brought your muffin, bro,” he whispered as he took out his drawing materials from his backpack. It was subtle, but enough to let him know that the truce had been accepted.

Class continued as usual. Will and Helen finished their assignments first, earning themselves a lot of praise and envy. To everyone’s surprise, so did Alex. Seeing the goofball’s “hidden talent” almost made the teacher get a stroke. It was more than skill, it was mastery that required years of practice to perfect.

While the rest of the class was astonished at the result, Will felt a lump in his throat. Alex was sending him a warning. Being looped for so much longer had also made him a lot more experienced. In both confrontations so far, he had proved to have the upper hand. Although, interestingly enough, not once had he attacked. He could done so have back when Will had no idea what was going on. Helen had, after all, so why hadn’t Alex?

The bell sounded bringing the class to an end.

“And remember,” the teacher said just as everyone started putting away their belongings.

“Practice makes perfect,” the students continued in the most unenthusiastic fashion possible.

“Or something of the sort,” the man said with a smile showing he was accustomed to disappointment. “Alex, Will, I’d like to have a word with you sometime this week.”

“Sure, bro!” The goofball grinned.

“Ok,” Will replied in a quiet tone. If this were outside the loop, he would have been thrilled. Right now, the only thing on his mind was the conversation.

“Great. Oh, and don’t forget your…” The teacher pointed at the paper bag on his desk.

“Nah, keep it, teach. For next time.”

A few bouts of laughter erupted as the people poured out into the corridor.

“Nice sketch,” Helen tore away from her friends. “Must have taken you a while to get the technique right.”

“Nah, bro. I’m lit.” He smiled.

Two of Helen’s friends rolled their eyes, leaving the room with a “don’t take long” glance at her.

“Yard?” Will asked in a whisper.

“Muffin place.” Alex finished packing his backpack. “My treat.”

“Muffin place,” the girl repeated.

It sounded just like something the goofball would suggest. It was also a good move. Open spaces gave him the advantage. Additionally, given that it was his home turf, there was every chance that he had set up a trap or two.

“Fine. Let’s go.” Will tossed the backpack on his shoulder.

“For real, bro?” The goofball arched his eyebrows, surprised.

“If it’s a trap, we can still do what I said in the next loop.” Will paused. “And all the loops after.”

1gl4nim,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gl4nim/i_found_out_after_a_decade_that_my_brother_is/,I found out after a decade that my brother is alive and thriving ,"

12 years ago when I 28F was 16, my brother Ryan now 30M was kicked out by our parents when he was 18 because he’s gay.

After he left he moved in with a friend but for the first 2 years I kept in contact with him, he moved in with friends bouncing from place to place.

I would chat with him frequently and would meet up with him from time to time (without our parents knowing) he wasn’t doing well at all and I could tell he was deeply depressed and affected from what our parents did to him.

One day, when u was 18 he invited me for coffee and told me that he was leaving England to stay with a friend up in Scotland, I told him I would continue to call him and that I would be here for him. And I was for about 6 months until my parents found out I was still in contact with him. They’re conditioning was I cut all contact or I’m also kicked out and disinherited. My uncle would have let me stay with him but I needed the money from my parents for schooling so I cut contact in the worst way possible, I would message and call him and then one day I just stopped.

I constantly wonder about my brother, if he was alive and if so how was he doing. He had drinking issues and even dabbled in substances after getting disowned so I tried to make him see I was there for him, maybe try and give him a reason to stay clean but I broke that promise to him. I genuinely thought he was dead as I hadn’t seen anything on social media and after school I tried to reach back out to him to apologise for everything but he must have changed his contact information because it went blank. 

A decade later, my dad passed of a heart attack, my mother moved in with with her sister and her kids and I was left the house previously in my dads name. I earn good in my field of work and I’m dating someone but I still am clueless about my brother.

Recently I was given the task of training a new staff member who moved from Scotland to England where I am. We have been chatting for about 2 months now and we are quite good friends. I told him roughly about my brother and that I haven’t seen him in a decade because of my parents and that I often wonder about him. I have 1 picture of him from when he was 15 and me 13 and I showed him. Turns out the place he worked in Scotland he worked with my brothers husband and he attended their wedding. He showed pictures from his husbands facebook, he’s alive, married, owns a nice house and they have a kid together. I’ve spent all this time wondering about all these things that could have happened to him and now I know. 

My coworker said I went pale when I saw the picture of the wedding, he looks the same, just now with a beard. 

My first instinct was that I had to reach out to him but after thinking about it I don’t know if I should, I’m not sure if the rolls were reversed that id want to be reached out to. I feel as though all I’d do is serve as a reminder of one of the worst times of his life, and what’s worse he might see what I did, after all, I chose inheritance and money over my brother. I wasn’t a young teenager I was 18, an adult who could have moved out but I cut him off anyway. 

I’m at war with myself. One half of me wants to reach out and let him know I’m so sorry for what I did and that I get if he doesn’t want anything to do with me but the other half thinks I should leave him be, he’s content and happy it seems so should I leave him to his life and let him stay ignorant to what I did. But I also wonder what he thinks of me now, if he knows my parents forced me into ghosting him or if he thinks I did it out of choice. 

If anyone has been through anything similar or even if you haven’t, what should I do, what would you want if you were in this situation.

1gl4lje,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1gl4lje/trip_review_3_weeks_of_fall_in_nagoya_matsumoto/,"Trip Review: 3 weeks of fall in Nagoya, Matsumoto mountains, Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka","One of my closest friends is from Japan and had her wedding there a few weeks back. I was excited to go, this would be my first time in Asia, I've always dreamed of going to Japan. It was amazing, beyond expectations. 

Biggest tips up front: 

\> get a e-sim on your phone, I used **ubigi**, it was amazing to not worry about data etc and being able to adjust the amount I had, use maps as much as I wanted, google things etc. I can travel light on data usage other places but not here, also maybe get a japan money card at one of the kiosks right off, u can use it for all travel and for the shinkansen app (usa cards dont work) + at vending machines, **suica or pasmo** u can add to your apple wallet and fill them up as needed -- u do not need to book shinkansen tickets ahead of time, but the machines and options can be tricky, i wish i had used the app more but my usa card didnt work so i gave up-- i think i could have used my suica in retrospect?

\>dont stress about seeing x,y,z if it's your first time in japan? for me the things i enjoyed most were just out of the way things, wandering kinda empty streets, eating, seeing-- i can't at all relate to the people who needed to see every temple, go to big theme parks, etc. also japan is soo convenient i would have worried about so many less things leading up to this trip, u can find anything anywhere all the time almost-- laundry was super easy > i wish i had brought a slip on outdoor shoe though, taking lace up shoes on and off so much was frustrating, some birkenstock clogs woulda been incredible

  
Itinerary --

Oct 15 fly from Paris to Seoul (i flew into seoul bc my boyfriend studied for 1 year there so he kinda insisted i check it out, also, direct flights on airlines i wanted at the time i looked were round trip $900 i think for seoul and about $1400 for tokyo)

Oct 16, 17 I explored Seoul 

Oct 18 Fly into **Nagoya** in morning, meet a childhood friend living there working for Toyota, drive 3hrs to Norikura - Kogen for 2 nights in a ryokan, Hirayu No Mori, it was around $500 for 2 of us for 2 nights, in a super nice traditional room that had western style thick mattresses and fluffly pillow/comforter, which after 2 nights kinda partying in Seoul I needed this badly, the onsen that first night + the ryokan dinner buffet had me in tears of joy

Oct 19 it was rainy this day, with a little sun inbetween but we hikes all around **Norikura-Kogen** this day, a bunch of small hikes, a few ponds/waterfalls all super accessible and just walking one-to-another, we had wild chai lattes(which we could smell a lot hiking) at a cute cafe called Kurumu, and some pumpkin cake, got a few cermaics here for gifts, i had gotten stung by a wasp or hornet on the trail and the girl working here was so helpful to give me a like suction thing and alcohol to treat it -- we had an amazing lunch at Cafe Maple and took a bus up to the top of the mountain, went back for onsen time, and had dinner at a ramen bar walking distance from the ryokan -- it was such an excellent first day in japan, and maybe one of my favorites of the whole trip-- i loved this place so much

Oct 20 we went to **Kamikochi** via a super easy shuttle bus across from the ryokan, saw monkeys on the road on the way, had breakfast at a fancy hotel near the bus stop-- hiked in a few hours, gorgeous views everyhere-- lots of people here compared to norikura though, more touristy-- had lunch at a little place in the woods along the trail that had fish being trapped from the river and cooked over charcoal all right there, delicious and easy -- drove back to Nagoya stopping at the **Shirahone** public onsen, which was on kinda a cliff, and very local and beautiful 

Oct 21 & Oct 22 I just explored **Nagoya** alone as my friend went to work & we had dinner together, I LOVED Nagoya, it wasn't touristy at all, was a bit she-she in a good way, had incredible food & vintage shopping around the Osu area, we had Maze Soba, conveyer belt sushi, an incredible teppanyaki at 鉄板ダイニング藤彩, one of my best meals, also being up early every morning and having incredible filter iced coffee and red beans on toast, anywhere u wanted u could have this 'coffee service' was such a treat

Oct 23 Apa **Asakusa** Ekime

I regretted staying here, everything before this felt quite special and perfect, and here was just rough, i chose this area because i wanted to maximize tokyo and thought, hey, i can just up early, see the temple, explore this neighborhood and move on-- the hotel had no real window, kinda opened directly onto a shaft but like no light + a smell from the restaurant below-- also this neighborhood was lively at night but very filled with tourists and touristy places-- and dead before 11am, no coffee even besides like starbucks chains or konbinis-- this was my least favorite part of my trip, i was just sweaty and stressed

Oct 24 Citadines **Shinjuku** 

2nd least favorite part, i think i coulda just visited shibuya once and moved on, didn't need to stay here, this hotel was directly on the path of the big tough guys trying to get you to buy hookers or go in their clubs, i spent the day trying to find a dry cleaner for my suit for the wedding and just walking around the neighborhood-- it was soo hot and muggy out, i got to see the iconic tokyo streets i had in my head, visiting the **Omotesando** area was a highlight

Oct 25, 26, 27, 28 **Shibuya Ebisu** Graphy Inn

loved this area, good mix of nearby things without being too in the center of it, i was maybe a 15 min walk from shibuya station?? but i spent these days exploring **Nakameguro** & **Shimo-Kitazawa** area and inbetween, these were my favorite parts of Tokyo, it was exactly what I wanted from the city-- I got to see the Meji shrine both as a tourist and seeing my friends wedding there, magical, visit the Marquis Maeda teahouse, lots of cute shops + coffee + snacks all around these neighborhoods, this healed me from the Shinjuku/Asakusa touristy days that made me wonder if I hated tokyo??

Oct 29 **Kyoto** Dormy Inn

This hotel was amazing, I think it was $80 a night, the rooftop onsen was huge and incredible, i loved being so close to the shinkansen, i could walk most places, I visited the Eikando temple (a little out of the way, so serene not too busy) + the botanical gardens & Imperial palace, it was again a little misty out so i think i dodged some crowds, though walking through Sannenzaka at night was wildly busy-- I did fushimi inari at dusk and it was beautiful, hiked to the top to avoid crowds a little, saw a crane on the pond-- in the end i wish i stayed here a little longer, but, also felt i saw it in the best way and got to be in and out

Oct 30 **Nara**

So the trains from Kyoto to Nara were messed up this day, not sure why, what should have taken like 40 mins took 2 hours, both ways, it was amazing to see all the deer, something i'd dreamed of doing, though it was very touristy at the bottom, and just sooo many people being a bit disrespectful maybe-- i walked far up and saw some beautiful shrines and peaceful bits of forest though, if the trains hadn't been a mess it would have been great, but, i was missing kyoto a little i would have been happier doing this as a half day than spending a full on it

Oct 31 **Nagoya** 

this was to recharge a bit, see my friend, have a quiet dinner and go out a bit for halloween, i was shocked how many japanese teenagers were going all out for halloween-- amazing costumes etc. it was fun to be back in this city that i felt i knew my way around etc.

Nov 1, 2 **Osaka**

this was the perfect end to my trip, a friday night in osaka, i stayed at the HUGE apa hotel, which, beyond the check in sucking, getting your luggage etc taking forever because there were something like 30 floors of rooms, the onsen was great and having a lawsons inside was cool-- my room had a nice view-- i walked all around, dotonbori canal, markets side streets malls-- recharged at the onsen then went out drinking-- i had some of my favorite food here, 2 very local vibe places i didn't save but one that was just grilling pork wrapped things like different vegatables i had red pickled ginger wrapped in pork grilled it was insane, the streets at night were so so beautiful, it was like being in blade runner but also reminded me of home (nyc) some times-- i went out drinking, needed to extend my (stupid) 10am apa checkout 2x but it was all worth it, my flight was 4pm

I wanted to thank everyone who gave advice on what to do and where to eat in Tromso (we got back Monday).

In a week we ate and drank at 

* Roast in the Scandic Ishavshotel (twice)
* Kaffeebonna (many times)
* Backstube bakery
* Kaia Bar and Bistro (twice) including Saturday night’s “piano man”
* Storhus Pizza (twice)
* Raketten Bar and Polse
* Roruba (wouldn't go back)
* Fjelheisen (bought waffles from two high school students sitting at a folding table in a snowstorm with a waffle iron plugged into an extension cord selling waffles to raise money for a charity project)
* Misfits Tiki Bar

I’m sure I’m missing a couple restaurants and half a dozen coffee shops, which seem to be on every single block. We also hit every souvenir shop in town.

We did the Chasing Lights tour and the Sami reindeer visit (ground wasn’t hard enough for sledding so we did double time feeding the reindeer). And the tram. 

Also hung out at the Jekta Storsenter, hung out with firefighters at the gigantic fire station in town, and spent a great time with everyone at Lydproduksjon Tromsø and toured the downstairs studio. Also attended the country music concert at the church last Sunday night. 

A good time was had by all. Again, thank you for suggestions. 

My one ""lesson learned"" was that it was approximately 0% humidity in Tromso. Coming from Florida where it's usually 100%, that took some getting used to, particularly my sinuses. And I will forever refer to Chapstick as ""reindeer lipstick.""",4,1730915561.0,tromsotravel,0,1.0,False

Has it made anyone worse or worse before it got better?,"I'm almost a week into taking the aloe vera & something has me in a flare that has me nearly leaking & needing to run to the bathroom or not able to leave it. Zero relief from my usual tricks - avoiding certain foods, drinking high pH water/ baking soda water to balance me back out.

Has anyone taken the aloe vera & it actually made it worse instead of better? Or was it difficult the first week or two & got better by sticking it out & taking for a month or more? Need help deciding whether to stick it out & keep taking to see if it gets better or call it a loss & move on to trying the next thing & consider myself one of the ones aloe vera doesn't help. I appreciate anyone who can share their experience.

Some further context: I've already been in a nearly two month flare with little to no relief & the usual fixes haven't been helping - which is unusual for me to flare longer than a week & for things to not help it even back out within a day or two. I've tried things like quitting caffeine too, but coffee & even energy drinks have never caused it to be this bad before. I was eating mostly fast food for a stretch, up until I just moved a week ago, & I've been eating healthier since the move. That may be a piece of it, but I feel like something has made it even worse *since* the move & I haven't determined a culprit. The only thing that's been new is the aloe vera, so I'm wondering about it. I'm looking to see a doctor soon to help me with the IC in general.",1,1730914668.0,Interstitialcystitis,3,1.0,False
1gl44dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenintech/comments/1gl44dq/usbased_workplace_tips/,US-Based Workplace Tips,"Hi there, woman in my 40s with lots of experience under my belt with a little advice that I was going to post as a response to the thread about not talking about the election results at work.

Worker protections in the US are garbage. Going through the process of suing employers related to discrimination is tedious and challenging. It's SO EASY for companies to target women, non-white people, queer people, neurodivergent people, and disabled people for termination and make it about some other issue. This helps to make it even more difficult to have recourse like successfully suing for discrimination. Some of you are already dealing with this on a day to day basis. The manifestation of this is supervisors who suddenly have problems with your performance after you've brought a hostile workplace situation to their attention. The boss who says that there's a culture fit problem before terminating you because you found out you were being underpaid for the same work as a coworker and asked for a salary adjustment. The team lead who backs up a team member who tells you to calm down after you ask a neutral question.

How do you make it harder for them? Remember the below. And others please feel free to share your own tips.

* Work is not ""family"", they're your employer and they hold the position of power in the dynamic ALWAYS.
* Work friends are not real life friends, they're acquaintances. Work friends will jeopardize your career/health/sanity to save their own. Be friendly, get coffee with people, but keep your guard up. This includes supervisors.
* HR works for the company/organization, not for you. They are there to minimize the company's risk, not act in your interests.
* If you are experiencing discrimination, your best friend is documentation. Screenshots, forwarded emails, logs of certain behaviors. All of this needs to be kept on a device or cloud service not owned or provided by the organization.
* Many/most employment lawyers work on contingency, they get paid when you get paid. If you are experiencing discrimination and feel like you are being pushed out and think you can't afford representation, you CAN find a lawyer who will represent you based on contingency.
* Tech workers can unionize, we can try to level the playing field with these companies. Unionizing isn't without risk, but formally organizing can trigger protections against retaliation and the appearance of retaliation. And honestly, isn't it better to try and get back some of your power from these chumps instead of just doing the capitalism death march while they use and abuse you.

Hi all! Not sure to what put here.. So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 39/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM here or on Discord and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of CoD from time to time.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

1gl3yu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1gl3yu0/the_night_shift_at_the_croatian_museum/,The Night Shift at the Croatian Museum,"Working as a night guard at a small Croatian museum seemed like a low-key way to make some extra money. A friend, David, had mentioned the opening—a quiet place, tucked away in the city’s old quarter, where work was almost nonexistent.

“Come on, man,” David had said, way too enthusiastically. “They pay well. Last week, I made an extra thousand just for staying an hour late.”

“Sounds sketchy,” the boy laughed. “If this paycheck feels like cartel blood money, I’m out.”

“Just show up, will ya? I’ll meet you there. Eight o’clock, and don’t be late, bozo.”

When he arrived, the museum looked eerie under the streetlights, shadows stretching over its weathered, white walls. He hesitated for a moment before stepping inside, drawn to the strange, musty scent that seemed to linger in the air. Paintings lined every wall, all old and unfamiliar. He sighed, already questioning his decision.

At the reception, David was slouched in a chair, half-asleep.

“David?” he whispered, nudging his friend’s arm.

David jolted awake, mumbling, “Huh? Wha—?”

“You seriously fell asleep on the job?” the boy asked, trying to mask his nerves.

David just laughed, rubbing his eyes. “This place drains you. Believe me.”

“Right… And I thought you were here for the easy money. How long have you been at it?”

David shrugged, yawning. “About a month. The boss, Mr. Boris, is… interesting. Friendly enough, but private. I haven’t quite figured him out.”

“Great.” The boy glanced around, the dim lighting doing nothing to ease his discomfort. A faint line of black-and-yellow caution tape blocked off a section of the gallery down the hall.

David noticed him eyeing it and stepped closer. “Whoa, we don’t touch that area, okay? Just ignore it.”

The boy held up his hands in surrender. “Fine. But seriously, doesn’t this all feel… off?”

David smirked. “What’s ‘off’?”

“The place. It’s closed off, yet no one’s here, and the boss is this mystery guy you barely know. It’s just weird.”

David sighed. “You’re overthinking it, man.” His friend grinned, the familiar David shining through. “Now come on, let me show you the ropes, Mr. Security.”

The boy forced a laugh, his tension easing as they ran through the security protocols. After a while, David’s energy flagged, and he started heading for the coffee machine. “One last thing—I need caffeine. You good if I leave you for a minute?”

“Fine, but I’ll haunt you if you don’t come back,” the boy teased, trying to lighten the mood.

“Right,” David chuckled, waving him off as he disappeared down the hallway. The boy exhaled, the silence in the gallery quickly settling back over him, thick and heavy.

Glancing around at the paintings, he squinted in the dim light. A mix of unease and curiosity bubbled up as he scrolled through his phone to pass the time. It was nearly 9 p.m., and the strange stillness made each minute feel longer.

Suddenly, a faint snicker echoed from somewhere nearby. He froze, his heart pounding, and glanced around. There was no one in sight.

“David, this isn’t funny,” he called out, but silence was the only answer.

As he scanned the room, his gaze drifted back to the sectioned-off gallery area, where the black-and-yellow tape was strung up. Behind it, partially hidden beneath a draped cloth, was a painting—a familiar one.

His pulse quickened as he took a few cautious steps closer, and as he neared, distinct features of Leonardo da Vinci’s *Mona Lisa* came into view. What was it doing here?

The cloth had partially fallen away, revealing a black, inky substance dripping from the frame. Against every instinct, he reached out and touched the edge of the cloth. It was cold, almost clammy, like something dredged from a swamp.

He took a step back, his gut twisting with a sense of wrongness. When he looked back at the painting, the woman’s expression seemed… different. The famous smile was wider, unnaturally so, and her eyes seemed to follow him with an unsettling awareness.

Blinking, he rubbed his eyes, half-hoping it was just a trick of the light. But as he focused again, the smile stretched even more, grotesque, twisting into an exaggerated grin that seemed more mocking than serene.

Staggering backward, his foot caught on the cloth, nearly making him trip. A soft, slithering sound echoed from behind him. His heart pounded in his chest, and he spun around, half-expecting David to be there, laughing at an elaborate prank.

But the hall was empty.

Swallowing hard, he turned back to the painting, his breath caught in his throat as he realized… the woman was gone.

The frame was empty, the inky residue smearing the edges, dripping onto the floor where her face had been just moments before.",0,1730914239.0,libraryofshadows,0,0.5,False

For context, I have an OL Pixie and drink milk based drinks (cappuccino or latte).  I’m not a big fan of flavoured coffee and never use syrups.

Despite reading poor reviews, I love the Unforgettable Expresso! It makes an amazing Cappuccino. It reminds me of a cross between Arpeggio and Kazaar. It’s perfect for my first morning coffee as it has a bit of a kick but with a smooth, cereal taste. I will be buying more.


I did not find the Almond Croissant to taste artificial or overly sweet.  Again, I’m drinking it with milk.
I found it had a subtle almond, vanilla flavour and it’s nice as a second coffee on the weekend.
I may buy one more sleeve.

The peanut sesame pod was a surprise for me as I almost didn’t order it.  I do not want to drink coffee that tastes like peanuts!   I made this as a lungo and added a splash of oat milk and it was quite good.
It has such a creamy, pleasant taste and I really like it. I will also have this on a weekend as a second coffee.
I will definitely buy more of this.

1gl3lyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingMallorca/comments/1gl3lyn/trip_recap_mallorca_in_november/,trip recap - mallorca in november ,"this sub helped me plan my trip, so i'm hoping someone will find this helpful! i was a bit worried about going in off season + weather but everything turned out fine. 

We spent 4 days in Pollenca. We picked Pollenca because we mainly wanted to come here for cycling and this is a convenient location in terms of cycling routes. I picked a small boutique hotel near Old Town. The hotel was very nice, had amazing breakfast and had a bike garage. They can also arrange rentals for you. 

Day 1: Flew to Madrid -> transferred to Palma. Madrid airport is very chaotic. I would budget at least an hour between the two flights. From the airport we picked up our car (went with Hertz), it was pretty smooth. From there we drove to Pollenca, about an hour, and checked in, then drove to Port Pollenca and got our bikes (from Mallorca Bike Hire, but there are many other bike shops and some with higher end road bikes). Short ride from Port Pollenca - La Victoria - Ermita de la Victoria - Alcudia, then back. Very beautiful scenery especially near sunset. 

  
Day 2: Pollenca - Cap de Formentor. Also a beautiful ride. Quite windy on certain parts of it and eventhough this is off season there's still bidirectional traffic and lots of cars at the end. You can really appreciate how rugged the coastline is. Nice cafe at the lighthouse. Lots of goats. 

  
Day 3: Pollenca - Sa Calobra, route based on this one:  https://ridewithgps.com/routes/47216085. This route starts with a nice stretch in rolling fields/wine country then 10 miles in the climb starts. We stopped for powerade and food at a gas station (about 20 miltes). The descent to Sa Calobra is breathtaking. There were not a lot of cars around, definitely more cyclists than cars. Once down at the bottom we had coffee and cake at the restaurant near the water. In case anyone else is planning to rent an e-assisted bike, for me using the battery at the lowest setting half of the time made the climb back up very doable. This route was my favorite on this trip. 

  
Day 4: Weather says rain, but by the time we got to Soller it was sunny. I think the weather is pretty unpredictable on Mallorca and changes from place to place, minute to minute. We just brought the bikes with us and ride if the weather is good. Short ride from Soller to Deia which was really nice. Lunch at La residencia which was super fancy lol but they were okay with two sweaty people in lycra. It was $$$$ but tasty. 

For Pollenca - our hotel recommended Respira which was an italian place. It's pretty good. 

  
Overall: November is a really nice time to come to Mallorca. The weather was amazing. I packed short sleeves and it was more than enough. Eventhough there may be rain, it's usually short bursts and you can usually wait it out or find another place without rain on the island. Not a lot of cars on the road at this time of the year and cars are very courteous to bikers. I was not honked at once and everyone gave a lot of room. Both bike and car rental were easy. Driving is easy on the highways but tricky in the towns because alleys are narrow. We were able to find free parking easily. Everyone we interacted with was friendly. Restaurants are definitely still open at this time of the year. We appreciated that the nights were quieter but I suppose if you are looking for vibrant night life November in Pollenca may not be the right choice. 

  
Hope this helps!

I know from the title itself you must think I’m super selfish and tbh I’d agree with you, but first let me give you some context…

I, (27 f) started dating my ex (33 m) a year back, at first, he was very cold, didn’t want to talk a lot, kept a lot to himself, but as he fell in love he started opening up more and being more talkative, but sometimes he would just go back to his little shell and not talk very much, which brought me down a lot, specially when we started having problems. The worst one was that his mom would get in between our relationship A LOT, I am not one to judge or say anything but I came to the conclusion she was jealous that he was in love with me, that he spent time with me, you get the idea, so, she started being rude to me, like throwing unnecessary comments at me for no reason, and damn this made me cry a lot because I’d tell him and he’d just simply say “ignore it” or “don’t entertain that nonsense “ but I wanted more, I wanted for him to have my back, not be mean to his mom but at least tell her “hey, she’s not doing anything to you so this is not cool nor necessary”. Anyways, first it was his mom, then, his dad started adding into it, and to make matters worse, my ex would tell me all about it and damn I was pissed, because what had I done to his parents? Nothing, I was nice, I was polite, I tried it all, I’m very extroverted so to not piss time off I’d just stay quiet when they were around, but nothing I was doing was enough. 

Another problem we had is that he would not like to pay whenever we went on a date, he’s very frugal about his money, but claims to have a lot, so, every time I asked to go somewhere I’d make sure I had the money to go and I just thought like, idk, look, I’m a student, I pay for my school, I work, I live by myself, he’d go and stay at my place and he’d notice I had no food, because I had NO money to buy any, and I felt he was being unfair, like okay I get being a 50/50 relationship, but, he has a very nice job, LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS, doesn’t pay any bills, his car is paid off, you get where I’m going like why was I paying a lot of the times when I was/am making just enough to survive, which is not his fault of course, I put myself in this situation, I’m just saying like; it’s rough out here and it’d been nice to have a helping hand. 

We had more problems of course, and also good stuff, ngl right like we had a good run and it wasn’t all bad! That’d be lying and I did not come to this Reddit group to do that, I’m being as honest as I can be, I have my delulu moments as well, let me get into them because I feel they’re the glue that attach this whole thing together.
Right off the bat, I have abandonment issues, of course caused by my dad, who else! Haha my trauma my jokes, anyways; I also started getting this idea (still have it) that because I’m getting older (I know 27 is not old old but in my mind, for where I wanted to be at yes) so, I just felt like “man, I wish I was married and I had someone to come home to”, to whoever lives alone, hats off to you because damn some days it just hits you, you’re there, by yourself, even if you’re sad, sick, tired, you name it. When I first moved to the apartment where I’m now, I didn’t even have a bed, I remember my ex helped me moved some clothes lol just that because he didn’t want to be bothered with the “heavy furniture” (a table and a couch) sorry I got off track but I just picture his face when that first night I stayed there, on the couch, with no pillows, I think I had a small blanket, and I saw his face, he pitied me, not enough to do anything about it, just felt bad, and so did I, I forgot to give context again! So, I moved from Mexico to Texas, about 2 years ago now, so, my immediate family doesn’t live here, not even close! And, I have a lot of pride in saying like “I’m okay, don’t worry about me” type of deal, another one of my traumas! I feel I can’t ask for help because I need to figure it out myself, so, in that moment, all I had was him, and I wanted to say, please stay, I feel alone and I need you, but I didn’t dare to ask, and he didn’t dare to do it either, he left, and I couldn’t help but cry that night. I’m not trying to make you feel bad, like I said, I put myself in the situation, I just, you know, wish he was there to comfort me, not pity me. 

Now, you might be wondering, what does that have to do with your title? Girl get it together right! I’m about to, if you’re still reading all my nonsense just hang on a little longer, I mean, I think it’s juicy gossip at least for you haha.

So, let’s meet this coworker, met him about 6 months ago, he’s 24, funny guy, talkative and very extroverted, you catch that? Total opposites! Didn’t see that one coming? Oh boy me either, or at least I wish I hadn’t, but I’ll get to that in a bit. 

We started off normally, like, those people you think nothing off after meeting them, for like 2 weeks I couldn’t tell him apart from this other coworker haha, like, I wasn’t paying attention! I was too caught up in my little world, also, I didn’t have any interest, not even in being friends so I was just doing my thing. I mentioned he’s extroverted right, so, he was playing his little extroverted game every time him and like a few other young coworkers and I would go and eat on Friday, like, asking me questions and trying to put me on the spot,
Me? Not very bothered by it, I’m not shy, and I can give a little sarcastic comment back if necessary so I wasn’t even sweating it, and I didn’t think anything of it either you know, when things just flow, you’re not keeping track of what’s happening, who’s saying this or that, or at least, that was me back then. So, idk how or when but we became close, like, at lunch people were just on their phones and he was throwing this jokes and man, I was laughing like he got me there ngl! Haha, so, he also has this little side where he can be very mature and serious and talk about anything, so we started like, talking more and more about deep stuff and I didn’t have that with my ex, so, every time Friday came along, I longed for Monday to come around, crazy right! Monday’s suck! Crazy what the mind can do, I know, so, I knew I started developing feelings, but I didn’t know what to do with them, and tbh I didn’t want to do anything with them. Selfish? Yes! Completely, I don’t have pride in how I did things, but, I can’t do anything about it, and I can’t dwell on it, I guess, learn and move forward. Damn I’m getting into the sad part already, so buckle up if you’re still here reading this. 

So, one day, a regular Wednesday I’m just there, chilling, being just a girly girl when, he sends me a little google chat, “hey I want to ask you something, can you come to my office?” Damn boy ask me through here wdym with all this mystery right, to make matters worse, I was going to NY the day after to celebrate my ex’a bday, talk about bad timing! Or was this all part of his little game? Idk. So, he confesses he likes me, he thinks about me after work, he’s super into me, his words okay? And, I’m just there like what? We’re both in relationships, this cannot be, but, he keeps saying, I know you feel this way too, why would you stay in a relationship where you’re not fully happy? He kept adding, at least you haven’t dated him for too long, not like me and my ex! And he said, our relationships will crumble eventually, why don’t we just give them time to do that and get back to this? And I was shocked, didn’t know what to say, I had feelings too but never planned on getting through them, so, I’d just say he got into my head.

I’m going to fast forward to the present now because if not this is going to be loooonger than what I think you can handle reading, so, guess what? Coworker breaks up with his ex, My ex and I kept arguing about his mom getting into our relationship, I told him also what this coworker had said to me and he took it completely bad, which is totally understandable you know, I don’t blame him for that, kept fighting back and forth, I kept blaming him for not having my back, he breaks it off through text. I’m hurt, I’m sad, I’m confused, my coworker keeps saying stuff like, we should hang out, and, I didn’t want to, even if I liked him, I felt it wasn’t right, the time was off, but I have trauma, I liked him, I thought, why not? (Bad idea, I know, karma’s coming my way don’t worry) 

So, we go out (for a month) at first, it was a fairy tale, you know, all good, all love, all into me, but what comes fast goes fast, and so it did; he started like “I love you, I’ve never had this connection with anyone, you’re so beautiful, I love being with you” to then being like “I really like you but I don’t think we can be in a relationship, I just got out of one (which I had told him of course but he didn’t listen) so, my traumas started peaking through, he started being less interested, I told him, let’s just be friends, at first he’d say, no, I don’t want to lose you! But later on, he’d say, okay; I just want you to be ok, and oh boy I wasn’t, I’m not okay still. So, do I feel like he love bombed me and used me? Yes, was it my fault? Yes, did I deserve it? Probably (yes).

Little vent coming your way:

I’m just pissed he lied, he didn’t need to, he wanted a rebound situationship, could’ve said it, he wanted you know what? Could’ve said it, we used to be friends, we used to be able to talk about things and now, we’re coworkers which only makes matters worse! 

So, what happened at last? (Girl just be done damn). Last I told him, we’re better off as just friends, but not friends that hang out or text, just friends who work together (different offices though at least) so, we’ll see each other whenever the occasion comes (work related) and be civil and polite. He didn’t like that, why can’t we be friends like we used to? Boy because we crossed a line! Can’t uncross it now, can’t go back either, so, for me it was, we either “date” or just be coworkers, whatever that means now. But he doesn’t want to, he’s all like, I just need time to be by myself, we can date but later on, and I’m like, no, not because it’s wrong to wait, which is what we should’ve done, but because we did things wrong and, he lied, made make promises, made me believe one thing, and just, disappointed me, why would I wait around and just expect him to .. come back? He doesn’t deserve that, at least I don’t think so. 

So, I’ve been seeing my ex at the gym, totally coincidental, we talked, he doesn’t want to get back together but he understands where he went wrong, and me? I think I need to take some time off and recover some of my aura, my coolness, my self worth because that’s gone.

So, what am I doing in this group?
 I’m just, sad, I left my relationship that I think I could’ve worked things out, because now talking to my ex he told me a lot of things I didn’t know about, and I feel so stupid for falling into this guy lies, or at least that’s what I think they are. As soon as things started getting just a tiny bit bad, he was like I’m out! But like, he insists on being “friends” (for now supposedly) give him time off, keep texting because he doesn’t want to lose contact with me and then, when the time is right, “date” I smell a bunch of lies, I think he just wants to keep me around for some ego boost until the next victim comes along! But, again, I can be wrong. 
I feel like, I’m confused, once again, I still have feelings for my ex, I do, we still have chemistry, I feel good the last two times I saw him and that we talked, we talked on the phone, like a month didn’t go by, it felt nice. 
Coworker wants to have lunch on Thursday because he wants to be “on the same page” about our situation, I said I will not be texting you if we’re “just friends” and he doesn’t like that, but he don’t “date” now, even if we take things slow. 

So, I don’t know what to say on that Thursday lunch, I think I should stick to, we’re coworkers, we shouldn’t have fed into this madness to begin with and I will NOT be waiting for you to come around but I feel like that sounds like omg you’re so important to me look at all my feelings and I’ve already lost a lot of my coolness and aura to this guy, which is why he’s “weirded out” by me, that I’m super intense and that I want things NOW and my way, which is true, ngl, but; I told him this prior to us going out, plus, he fed me a bunch of lies so, not entirely my fault. 

As per my ex, I don’t think he wants me back, and he shouldn’t, I made a big mistake, and, maybe I’m just sad now and not remembering it wasn’t all good, but when you reminisce it’s hard to stay on the “you also hurted me” lane, at least for me. I miss him thou, I told him, and lowkey, I wish it hadn’t ended. But, I don’t know how to grow close to him anymore, and I don’t want to hurt him. 

Do you think coworker is lying to me? 

What should I tell him when he brings up the “I’m not ready for a relationship but want to somehow keep you around” subject?

Am I completely selfish for wanting to grow close to my ex again, and try to maybe pursue something back?

1gl3ccd,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1gl3ccd/thoughts_for_november_6_2024/,"Thoughts for November 6, 2024","I enjoy reading, especially when it comes to topics of fitness - like weight loss.

So here is my journey. Then I'll add a bit of spice, which will probably piss some people off BUT I wish my doctor(s) would not have sugar coated things for me.

I started gaining weight when I was young probably early teens.

I steadily gained weight.

My parents took me to the doctors. The most *any* doctor said was that if I don't do anything now I'll be 200lbs by the time I'm 18 years old.

Well... I made it! And over the years just kept adding more and more and more...

But you know what? I had a lot of friends. Nobody cared about my weight, so neither did I.

My parents didn't care enough to maybe get me involved in sports, or see a nutritionist or anything else. Do I blame them entirely? Nope - I know a lot of it was on me but when you're young you don't know any better and not all your friends do either.

I wish back then I had done something, but the next best time is now.

But you know what I did for 40+ years? I looked for the magic pill. Seriously. I remember when Phen-Fen was the rage but only *certain* doctors would prescribe it for you. I went to WW. I tried everything except what was *proven to work* because it was too hard. Fuck that, right?

I ended up becoming Type 2 Diabetic. Think that stopped me from eating? Nope. Shit - drugs helped me control my blood sugars. Who needs to diet or eat right???

Now that I got my ass in gear and am losing weight, I had to make drastic change.

* Stopped eating most processed foods with some small exceptions
   * Some cracker are OK
   * NO potato chips or other junk food
* NO SODA or added/processed sugar (so things like chocolate)
* Stopped eating out
   * Do you know how many calories there are in a Filet of Fish?
   * Do you know how many calories are in a chicken burger?
   * Do you know how many calories there are in a small/medium or large fries?
* Walking
   * Walking up to 10km per day
* Strength training
   * Minimum 3x per week
   * Darebee - TRY THEM OUT. THOUSANDS of exercises you an do at home, with or without equipment and they have an amazing support system (forums)
* Recording every fucking thing that I eat
   * It absolutely SUCKS but I've tried eyeballing food and I'm almost always over.

I've lost weight. I've regained my confidence because I fucking LOOK better. I can approach people without being self-conscious about how I look (not that I would - I'm an introvert). But I've had people approach me. Went out for a coffee all by my lonesome and this really cute guy and I struck up a conversation. I'm in a relationship so nothing would come out of it, but it felt ***good***. I've had women strike up conversations with me in the grocery line, or hold open a door. That has **never** happened to me. Ever.

So I totally get all this body positivity stuff and that you should be happy with your body - but the problem is, people around you are probably not. Lets face it, society does not like large people (in most cases).

When I scroll through some of the sub-Reddits or other sites and see posts like:

* I only eat xxxx calories per day and I'm gaining weight
   * You are NOT eating that many calories. You are eating MORE than you think you are.
* I cut out all processed foods but I'm gaining weight
   * Riiiiiight.
* I don't see results
   * You won't right away. It will take time. Stick with it.
* Eating healthy is expensive
   * Damn right it is. But you know what is MORE expensive? Dying. Type 2 Diabetes. High blood pressure. High cholesterol. Well, OK dying is expensive to *someone else that has to bury you*. You know how expensive T2D is if you DON'T have insurance? I spend > $3600/year and I have insurance.
* I don't have time to exercise
   * I know. Neither do I. But you know what, you make fucking time for yourself!

Here are more reasons (aka excuses) that I've read, but I won't comment on...

* I exercise every day but haven’t lost a pound
* I eat low-carb, but my weight isn’t budging
* I’m fasting for 16 hours daily but am not losing weight

I totally get it. I was overweight for over 40 years when I finally decided enough was enough. It is a journey of self discovery and it takes everyone their own time to get there. You need your own motivation.

One thing I've learned is that you CANNOT do it for anyone else.

Hey - if I die tomorrow, yes my family will miss me but give it some time and they won't even realize I'm not around anymore. Harsh, but true. 

So why lose weight? Why get fit.

FOR YOUR FUCKING SELF.

You have to want it for YOU. Not for your wife/husband/partner/kids/parents or whomever. It has to be FOR YOU.

I am tired of being fat.

Of not being able to walk up stairs without sweating like a pig.

Of not walking up the stairs because I will sweat.

Of stinking because I sweat.

Of not being able to wear a nice shirt without spending $100.00 on one.

Of not being able to look at myself in the mirror because all I see is a blob.

Now - had my doctor(s) or parents just straight up and told me what my life would be like as I get older, maybe I would have done something then. I don't know. Hindsight is 50/50, right?",2,1730912677.0,selfaccountable,1,1.0,False

Any other specialty baristas clashing with new people at your job who are coming from old school shops?,"So i have this coworker who has been a barista in a Starbucks like environment for 10 years. I have never worked at Starbucks. I've been in the restaurant industry for 15 years and when I decided to focus on coffee, I chose specialty from the beginning and have formed all of my habits in this environment to serve the goals and values of specialty coffee. 

Enter coworker. 

They have all the telltale habits. Overly thick milk, aggressive uncareful puck prep, leaving milk on the counter, doesn't dial in, when they're restocking milks, if the oat milk is the same date, they just put the warm stuff up front. Everything gets sticky when they work bar and they take syrups off the shelf and then just put them wherever on the counter is closest to their hand instead of back on the shelf a mere six inches away from that location. They're just very disorganized and frantic and they constantly express the opinion that these details don't matter because we're really busy and we just need to get this done. 

Where this really becomes a problem is they are trying to get me to adopt their habits and they make passive comments to me suggesting that I'm incompetent because I'm doing these things that they don't do, or avoiding things that they do. I'm constantly tidying up the bar around them, wiping up their spills, and putting the milk away so it stays cold. 

I aim to provide every customer with a coffee experience that is worth every penny of the 6 dollars they're paying for it and i need as much time to polish microfoam as possible to do that. I need the milk to melt as little ice as possible.  I need space to build tickets efficiently in order to take those extra steps while churning drinks out quickly without everything getting jumbled and the oat milk going in the wrong drink. I throw the puck away if the portafilter cracks the group head because 6 dollars is an outrageous sum to pay for a watery, sour, cup of hot milk. I keep the tamper clean because 6 dollars is an outrageous sum to pay for a watery, bitter cup of hot milk.

And I have this person rolling into a new environment trying to apply completely different rules to it, and frankly disrespecting me in the process by treating me like an amateur, literally for already being adapted to this environment, instead of adapting to the new environment that they've chosen to be in.

It's honestly outrageous and infuriating. I'm not really sure how to approach it. The last time we clashed, I had just tidied up the bar and they told me to leave the milk out. I told them I don't expect them to adopt my habits but I don't intend to compromise my values. They didn't push back but since they've been making pointed comments about the things that I do. I don't want to turn it into a confrontation, but we have to be able to work together and I currently hate working with them because I've deliberately become the barista i am for many reasons and deliberately chose not to become that kind of barista for mostly the same reasons. To have that kind of barista pressuring me to be like them is infuriating.

All im asking is some advice and another points of view.

EDIT 2: It definitely was the moment (during sex) and how she talked that took me off guard. I will talk to her about how it made me feel, Next time, she can tell me about her past misdeeds over a cup of coffee, not while we are fucking like rabbits.

For better context, lets call me A (38M). I've been dating my girlfriend, let’s call her F (33F), for four months.

During this time, she has been everything I could ask for in a partner. We get along amazingly well and share many ideas and values, she is a professional in a really hard field. She describes herself as someone who values honesty in all situations.

I on the other hand I'm an engineer, who has an excellent memory and prone to remember almost all the details from our conversations, like her expressions, gestures, and tone of voice. This ability, along with a traumatic childhood, has given me the skill to tell when someone is sincere or lying once I get to know them and observe their behaviour.

F has always been curious to learn about my life and past relationships, asking me many questions about my experiences and thoughts, because she had a bad string of awful relationships (her words), and never passed the 1 year mark in any relationship. I didn't mind because i don't have anything to hide. We even did the 36 questions to fall in love to get to know each other better, though she skipped some questions, saying they were too private.

I’ve also asked her about her past, but I’ve noticed that she’s reluctant sometimes to go into details. She prefers to summarise or evade the conversation when she feels uncomfortable. I’ve learned her gestures and mannerisms for when she’s being truthful, when she feels forced to say something, and when she’s not sincere. Because of this and out of respect for her personal history, I chose not to push her too much.

Since F had asked me so many questions about my life and past relationships, I asked her some questions about her past and if there was something she was afraid to tell me for fear that I might judge her or be disappointed in her.

She assured me there was nothing to hide, and I let it go, I saw she feel ashamed of something, and while i suspected something, i knew that pushing her was only going to make her more shut about it.

**The ""Problem""**

The issue came up this week. In the middle of having sex, F said she needed to confess something:

When she was 25, she had a relationship that lasted a few months with her university professor, a married man of 50. When I asked who had initiated the affair, if it was him, she said it was mutual. However, I noticed her response didn’t feel genuine, which suggested that she might have started it. She claimed they didn’t have sex, though she mentioned that she had tried to move things in that direction but that he was less willing. According to her, the affair ended because she felt guilty for ""sinning"" and stopped it only after confessing in church. She never told me she thought the situation was wrong.

This confession left me feeling uneasy and full of doubts because she is the exact opposite of the women i dated before. She is for a lack of a better term, a really smart, professional and emotional woman.

Also. it’s not so much the act itself that bothers me because everyone makes mistakes and can learn from them, it’s more her lack of remorse and the justifications she provided. such as saying it happened because he told her he was ""only married for his autistic son and hadn’t been intimate with his wife for two years"" The break of it only after confessing in church because she knew it was morally wrong, didn't sit me well either.  
My problem es that she never said she regretted it, or that it was a mistake or what she did was wrong.

I know I need to talk to her about this, and i know what i wrote here is a good starting point, but still, some advice is always good.

Some clarifications:

\- She was single at the time, the professor kinda courted her (is this the correct word for ""wanted to fuck her""?) when she showed interest in him.

\- She knows i have perfect memory, she was amazed i remembered everything about our first date.

\- She told me she will never ever cheated on my because she loves me a lot.

\- English is not my first language, sorry for bad grammar.",16,1730912497.0,relationship_advice,75,0.62,False

1gl33ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gl33ll/from_graphic_designer_to_game_developer_how_to/,From Graphic Designer to Game Developer: How to Launch a Successful Kickstarter for Your First Game (and Survive the Process),"Hello, everyone! I would like to share the lessons I learned transitioning from a graphic design background to game development, and how I approached my first ever Kickstarter campaign, in case my experience can be helpful to anyone!

Diving into game development from a background in graphic and web design has its advantages: the ability to create a cohesive aesthetic and visually engaging experience. However, when I decided to embark on this journey and launch a Kickstarter campaign for my first video game, **TIES: Soul Link**, I realized that the path held more nuances and challenges than I had imagined.

My design experience was fundamental in creating a visual concept that would capture the attention of potential backers right from the start. Thanks to the branding and web design skills I had developed, I was able to present the game in an attractive and clear way, establishing a connection with the audience. I also had support from a marketing agency, which helped amplify the message to an even wider audience. Here are some key lessons that helped make my campaign a success:

**1. Prepare Before Launching the Campaign**

Before starting the campaign, it’s essential to build a strong follower base. Promoting the game ahead of time and generating interest on Kickstarter can make a big difference, especially in those first few days. In our case, we ensured a solid base of followers and attended in-person events to showcase **TIES: Soul Link** and receive direct feedback from players. This process not only enriched the game's development but also created excitement so the campaign could get funded quickly after launch.

**2. Build a Consistent Visual Narrative**

To capture attention on platforms like Kickstarter, your project needs to tell a story from the very first moment. I created a visual design that reflected the tone of **TIES: Soul Link**, blending an adorable yet brutal aesthetic that surprised and engaged the audience with this uncommon style.

**3. Apply Web Design Principles to the Campaign**

A crowdfunding campaign design is similar to a web page: essential information must be clear, accessible, and visually appealing. We planned my Kickstarter page as a visual journey where potential backers could easily explore the game, clearly understanding **TIES: Soul Link** from the start and being guided step-by-step through rewards and project details without losing interest.

**4. Invest in Quality Images and Animations**

To make the project stand out, I used my graphic design skills to develop impactful illustrations, character animations, and screenshots. Even with a limited budget, it’s crucial that the images speak for themselves and communicate the essence of the game in a single glance, with a compelling Key Art to capture users’ attention and invite them to explore your campaign.

**5. Don’t Underestimate the Power of Marketing and Social Media**

A Kickstarter campaign isn’t just about having a good product; it’s about visibility. I invested in strategic marketing and advertising platforms and leveraged social media to broaden the project’s reach. Additionally, having a team like Make Good Art was fundamental for managing all aspects of marketing. My design and illustration experience also helped me create visually appealing content to promote the campaign.

It was also essential to reach out to streamers who could help spread the word. Since we had a limited budget, we tried to grab their attention with custom illustrations showing how they’d look within **TIES: Soul Link**. This approach intrigued some, and they shared the game with their followers. Sending press releases to media and specialized sites was also crucial for coverage in blogs and gaming sites, increasing the project’s visibility. Finally, having Backerkit to send newsletters and promote **TIES: Soul Link** was also an important part of the campaign.

**6. Leverage Networking and Industry Contacts**

Though I came from a graphic design background, I sought help in the game development community. I established connections with other developers, WhatsApp groups, and platforms that helped me promote the campaign. This is a very important point: setting up cross-promotion during the campaign attracts a good audience interested in your game to Kickstarter.

**7. Carefully Evaluate Physical Rewards and Merchandising**

Physical rewards are an excellent way to motivate backers but can be a double-edged sword if not managed well. I decided to include some exclusive physical items like figures, plushies, and an art book, but it’s essential to be careful with manufacturing costs and the impact on your budget. Production costs can easily spike if you don’t manage to sell minimum quantities, reducing your profit margin significantly. If you include physical rewards, make sure to plan their costs and minimum quantities carefully to avoid unpleasant surprises.

In summary, launching a successful Kickstarter campaign is a mix of design, strategy, and perseverance—plus a lot of work and coffee. For those considering the leap from graphic design to game development, I assure you that the skills you already have can be a solid foundation to succeed in the world of crowdfunding.

As a child, my parents (non-military) moved us every 3-5 years. So I have no sense of home, no stability, and a permanent wanderlust. And since I turned 18, (43 now) I have been entirely on my own. For a frame of reference.
 
I put myself through college in my mid-20's at a Midwest good (IMO) state college. I received a degree with good marks for what it's worth in political science (I know), telecommunications, and studies in music. 

I worked my way through college in restaurants. I took an internship at the state house working for the Democratic Party before I graduated.
 
Since then, I managed a small independent coffee shop for a year and a half, I also took an internship on a political campaign which led to jobs as a field organizer, field director, and then campaign manager in 2016, winning both races I was running, one of the few to do it. I also worked for a pro-lgbt business civil rights initiative 
 
I also waited tables and bartended in between campaigns.
 
I then worked in shipping and receiving at a floral warehouse for a while, until I took a job as a journalist at a small town newspaper. After that I went back to waiting tables for a year.

I then was a digital organizer (basically light graphic design, Final Cut Pro video editing, and social media management) for a non-profit during the pandemic. 

Since then, I worked at a brewery once the pandemic ended, and was waiting tables.

Then worked a temp job for a financial services firm doing onboarding for a few months until it ended.
 
And most recently was a remote technical onboarding specialist for an education org that set school districts up with digital programs for math and science and reading and assessments, until that job contract ended a couple weeks ago.
 
I've been applying for 20-25 jobs a day. And I can't even barely get an interview.

I've applied for everything from Starbucks barista to remote jobs in my skill set to anything in between. I'm willing to stack boxes in a warehouse again, to wait tables, to doing anything to not be financially destitute, broke, and homeless with my dogs. They are my entire world.

What can I do, so I can find a gainfully paid, living wage, professional ideally not contract job? I just want to be steady and stable for once in my 25 years of so called adulthood.

1gl2y7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuseboxgames/comments/1gl2y7r/what_i_think_so_far/,What I think so far:,"I think the hate on this season is a tad unfair.  It's the best **or** second best season since Bombshell. Most of the characters have personalities and we get little bits about them to flesh them out. Nyah preferring the taste of coffee after brushing her teeth for example. Jesse's interests in science is different for a LI.

I chose to exclusively go for Hayden to test the new heart system out. I'm ecstatic we finally have some sort of way to pie the other boys off and they LISTEN (mostly)!!! Sure every guy still wants MC but it's an improvement! I liked the Blindfold Bombshell challenge because I found it fun and different. Plus I think it showcased the heart system well. Look through the sub! People are saying, ""I'm surprised I got X and not Y"" while others (myself) say, ""I got exactly who I wanted/thought I would!"" YAY BRANCHING!

I'm so thrilled that after coupling up with Hayden his personality didn't seem to disappear.  He's his romantic self in the tree house and at brekkie. I 'awwed' when I chose to stay out of the water fight and Hayden ""stood in the line of fire to keep me dry""! It seems like something he would definitely do.

As for the latest episodes (v5) it went exactly as i thought. No surprises.  Dunno if that's good or bad, so I'll say it's neither. I even guesguessed the first episode that it'd end with a dumplings cliffhanger. 
**I really wish we had the recoupling in the SECOND episode** for pacing reasons. It felt unnecessarily drawn out in an effort to poorly build suspense. When we finally got our guy/gal it felt like...rushed when we finally got there? I paid for every gem scene too, trying to pad it out and I still feel that way? Am i crazy? 

Now for my controversial opinion: Sorry, but nothing will *ever* be as boring as Stick or Twist! The characters were bland, Uma was an annoying and predictable pot stirrer, no one had personalities. Yeah Tristan and Sofia are *aggravating as shit* to someone who doesn't like to do drama, but it's entertaining as hell! Most of me wants those two dumped so we can move the plot along, but a part of me wants them to stay because Milo/Nyah are old news and *all* there is to Franki's personality now is sulking about Hayden (in my playthrough)! Seriously,  do we know anything about her likes/dislikes, interests, hobbies? PERSONALITY?! 
Lisbeth and Franki have so much potential as alt girls, which i don't remember one since Najuma?! Neither one seems to have a purpose but either stand there and sulk (Franki) or stand there and look hot (Lisbeth). What do you guys think?",3,1730911720.0,fuseboxgames,2,0.67,False
1gl2vvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1gl2vvi/29_reduction_in_ldl_cholesterol_in_8_weeks_from/,29% reduction in LDL cholesterol in 8 weeks (from 266 to 188),"To preface, I'm pro-statins and will go on one (or several), but I can't take anything right now as I am trying for a baby (I'm 37F).

Here are my results (sept vs nov):

Total Cholesterol: 355 to 263

Triglycerides: 182 to 149

Cholesterol in HDL: 52 to 48

Cholesterol in LDL: 266 to 188

Cholesterol non-HDL: 303 to 215

Bilirubin: 43 to 33

ALT: 111 to 58

I've also lost between 10-15 lbs.

**My story:** I found out I had very high cholesterol (355 mg/dL, which is 9.18 mmol/L) and LDL (266, which is 6.89 mmol/L) in early Sept. Because statins are contraindicated for pregnancy, all I had under my control was diet. I did not have a lot of hope because my cholesterol was in the FH range and [there is a paper that shows that diet is not often helpful for people with cholesterol as high as this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622009580). Also, at 5'6 and 165 lbs and a regular runner on a whole foods diet I didn't think I was the sort of person who could see a dramatic change. But I was wrong!

**My diet:** But feeling otherwise powerless, I cut out as much saturated fat as I could, and increased fibre, and in particular soluble fibre, as much as I could. So I decreased pretty much all animal production except for skim milk in my coffee and the occasional skinless chicken. Dramatically increased fibre with beans, root vegetables, oatmeal, flax seeds, and psyllium. I eat quinoa as my primary grain for lunches and dinners but I occasionally had sourdough or pumpernickle bread, chickpea pasta, potatoes, or a few other things. For fats I ate raw sliced almonds, flax seeds, small amounts of peanut butter, avocado oil, and some olive oil. For proteins I used almonds, soy proteins like tofu, beans, occasional greek yogurt, skim milk, and some fish. I didn't eat any sweets but I did occasionally snack on popcorn or sunchips (I love salty and crunchy snacks). I used dry seasonings, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and mustard as condiments when needed instead of sauces. I take about 2 tbsp of psyllium a day (I was taking it before bed, but I'm trying to take it before meals to optimize binding to bile salts excreted during digestion). I'm also taking vit D and folic acid regularly and occasionally choline and inositol.

So, I obviously haven't solved my problem, but I was not expecting an almost 30% decrease in LDL and almost 50% decrease in ALT over 8 weeks.

My current concerns are if there is a chance these values can decrease further and making sure I can maintain these changes in the long run.

Hopefully this can be inspirational to people with very high cholesterol that yes, your diet could make a big difference.

1gl2ucp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gl2ucp/i_am_in_love_with_my_married_best_friend_and_i/,I am in love with my married best friend and I hate it,"I know I'm a terrible person and I will receive a lot of hate for this. I deserve all the hate. I made those choices and I should face the consequences. I deserve it all. But I really want it to stop hurting.

I met my best friend when I was going through a very rough patch in my life. I had been diagnosed with clinical depression and mild schizophrenia. The first time I met him, I immediately hated him. This was a few years ago, 2018. But, for some odd reason, I opened up to him and cried—probably because I was mad drunk. That was the beginning of my downfall.

We grew closer over time. He was caring even though he didn’t fully understand me. I finally found someone who wasn’t willing to give up on me. Slowly, I felt drawn toward him. We spent a lot of time together. We even kissed once. I immediately regretted it. He was taken. It was wrong. I apologized. I didn’t want any more drama in my life, given I was already quite vulnerable, so I decided to maintain my distance from him. I moved cities in 2019, cut all contact eventually. Almost a year of no contact. I fell in love again and got married to my husband in 2020. I moved to a different country, was happily settled, when out of nowhere my best friend texted me. Early 2021. He was a mess, just like I once was. I decided to be there for him just like he was always there for me. Huge mistake.

He got better over time, and I got worse. The feelings resurfaced and grew stronger. I tried to dismiss them, but I couldn’t. To make it worse, he also started being flirtatious (harmless). I let it slide. He used to say the nicest things to me, care for me deeply, cheer me up. We used to talk constantly, either texting all the time or on video calls. We shared everything, every minute detail. The closer we became, the stronger my feelings grew. It was just bad. I felt guilty because I was married and he was with his girlfriend. He got married too in 2022, but that didn’t change anything. I thought once he got married, our feelings would change, but no. It wasn’t just me; he started falling too. We never confessed our love for each other back then, pretending to be friends, but we both knew this was more than friendship. He was good at dismissing his feelings, though. I couldn’t do that.

One day (late 2023) he sent me an Instagram reel asking something like, ""If I couldn’t say no to you, what would you ask for?"" I replied with a message talking about wanting domesticity—just being around each other. I knew I had made a mistake. Not only was I being disloyal to my partner, I was also disrespecting our friendship. But he let it slide, and we both pretended like nothing happened. But the next day, he actually reacted.

There was this thing I used to do where I’d ask him to tell me something nice—anything at all. That day, when I asked him to, he got angry. He told me to ask my husband if he would be okay with me asking such questions. This was very unusual of him, and I knew this was him reacting to what I had told him the day before. We fought. I cried. I apologized. He never responded, so I walked away. We didn’t speak for almost a year.

A few days back, he messaged me again. A simple ""hi,"" but I was so overwhelmed. Time had passed, but I was still stuck where we had left things. I replied, ""Hi, how are you?"" We exchanged some basic hellos. It felt weird. He finally started talking about that last fight, how sorry he was for the way he reacted, that he had been waiting for my message for so long. I had never messaged him because I thought he hated me. How wrong we both were. He told me he could never hate me. He messaged me to share big news, a milestone with me. I congratulated him.

But I also told him that our friendship was doomed. He knew why: feelings. These damned feelings. I finally told him that I was in love with him, but I wanted to leave because it was wrong. We had defined boundaries for our friendship that we both kept crossing to the point where there were none. The lines were blurred. He had a better handle on his emotions; I didn’t. And the only way for me to deal with this was to walk away and never look back. Before leaving, though, I wanted him to tell me how he felt about us. He said there couldn’t be more than friendship in this lifetime. That was obvious, but it wasn’t the answer to my question. I asked him again, ""How do you feel about me?"" He told me then that I was the person he cared for and loved deeply—but as a friend. There was a time when he felt we were more, when he wanted more, but he didn’t act on those feelings (lie! He did. All the nice things he did for me were out of that love). We said goodbye. But I couldn’t last even a day without him, so I asked him to fix it, make those feelings go away. And he told me to just wait and let time do its magic. I tried. I tried to be a friend. 

We had started to get back to normal when he told me about his office crush. Someone he’d known online a long time ago, someone he’d thought he would meet in a romantic setting, was now sitting right next to him. What are the odds, huh? He tried to maintain his distance, but he eventually started to have feelings. They used to go for coffee together, go for lunch together. But all of a sudden, she went cold, stopped talking to him. When he told me about it, I tried to act cool. But I was hurt. Extremely hurt. For one entire year, I had been living with the guilt that I had done something terribly wrong, something unforgivable, while he was busy falling for someone else. I asked him, “Whatever happened to your boundaries, then?” He told me it was nothing, fleeting. I cried. A lot. Cursed our friendship. Cursed my feelings. Told him he used me. That because the office crush stopped talking to him, he reached out because he wanted a shoulder to cry on. My feelings were wrong, but his for her weren’t. How easy it was for him to dismiss whatever we had, saying there couldn’t be anything more because of loyalty and out of respect for our partners. And then he told me that I was special to him and always would be. ""I love you, but not in the way you think. I don’t miss another person like I miss you. I can’t imagine a world where you’re gone or unhappy. I feel the need to protect you. I want to be there for you when you need me. I don’t care about another person that way. You are special, but it’s probably not what you think it is or expect.""

I was crushed. I still am. I told him I wanted to leave, and I did. But a week later, he was back again. This time to wish me a happy birthday. We spoke, just like old times. I thought maybe I could go back to being friends. So I tried again. If I could pretend for years in the past, I still can or that's what I thought. But here I am, still trying to get over these feelings, still crying, still wanting to leave. It hurts when I leave, and it hurts when I stay. He called me yesterday. His wife was there too. I tried to act normal as always, but I could barely hold that conversation. I was on the verge of a breakdown. Every time I see him, I cry. But I still can’t walk away. And I hate it. I hate myself for being like this. I hate him for doing this to me. Feelings don't just develop out of thin air. And I hate that I know it’s wrong, but I still can’t walk away. I deleted all social media, deleted his contact too. I don’t want to talk to him ever again. I can’t live with this constant pain. It just hurts.

I made a mistake. I never intended for it, and it wasn’t immediate, but slowly, my feelings shifted. I’ve been feeling trapped between guilt, love, and confusion, and the deep bond we built has made this even harder.

I don't know whether I need to ditch my best friend as I don't feel he's got any time for me and puts no effort in, here's how it goes. Me 33F and my best friend, 34M, were besties at school. Basically like siblings, we kinda lost touch over the last 10 years but over the last 2 have got back in touch and we're thick as thieves again. I bloody adore him, we get along when we're together like you wouldn't believe, his wife and 3 kids are the best and my partner gets along with him really well too. All sounds great on a surface level. 

But he literally cannot make even 2 minutes to message me or have a chat or see how I'm doing. Not getting into it but I'm signed off work for the next 2 months at the moment so have a lot of time on my hands. He's repeatedly said oh we should hang out in the day, it'll be good for me to get out, ""I wanna help you get through this blah blah etc"". I said to him a month ago when I was first signed off that I would appreciate that so much, I'm doing my head in as I can't get about easy and even catching up once a week for a coffee would be grand. He always goes ""this sounds great, super excited let me know when and we'll sort it"". 4 times now I've said I'm free whenever, you let me know and he goes oh we'll set up today for instance (the latest being on Monday) Ive told him to let me know this morning and I haven't heard from him. Again. I can nudge him and send a message and I'll get an apology and an excuse. Usually it's ""I'm just soooo busy being a stay at home dad to twins and my ADHD just makes me forget and I do really wanna see you but when I finally get some alone time I just ignore everyone and do what I wanna do because I never get a chance"". I understand that completely. He's struggling with a few things at the moment himself and I want to be a support friend but he's bloody draining me. 

I have brought this up to him, and again I get the same excuses and he promises he'll stop being an arse and let me know and chat with me more than one message a week (he's always been one of those always late people which for me who's always early pisses me off 😂)... But he doesn't. I don't really know how to approach this anymore. I fed up of feeling like I'm bottom of the priority list but getting told otherwise but I love the guy. I don't wanna lose him as he's being an arse. 

Can't figure if I'm being a arsehole or if he just doesn't give a damn anymore and can't be bothered.

Day 1 and 2 I was wired, which was to be expected, but Day 3 all of a sudden I felt truly amazing. I didn't feel much anxiety and my depression had entirely cleared up, and for the first time in years I felt like I could truly just sit down and get my work done. It was an absolute game changer - I realized from this that I may have been living with a serious handicap the past few years. There were some side effects (insomnia for one) but 5-10mg of melatonin seemed to knock me out and get me a good night's rest (surprisingly without leaving my groggy in the morning, another thing I had been feeling for years).

However yesterday, for whatever reason, my blood pressure shot up to 143/90 and my heart was racing and palpitating. I had anxiety like no other and couldn't focus on *anything* at all, a total shift from how I had felt just a day prior. It was so bad I had to leave work and just lie down, I couldn't think straight or communicate at all.

Nothing was different about that day. As with all days prior, I had taken the wellbutrin at 8 in the morning and had two medium cups of coffee brewed at home (so probably only \~100mg of caffeine). It started around 10am. My blood pressure has returned to normal but my anxiety is still high, and my heart feels so bizarre (maybe it's palpitations, maybe it's anxiety, maybe it's psychosomatic, all I feel is like a ""tightness"" and ""hollowness"" in the left side of my upper chest).

It was so bad I called my doctor and she changed my prescription to Wellbutrin 100mg SR. She didn't seem too concerned about anything except for the heart palpitations.

There’s an old lady about 70-80 years old who is often lurking about Tamp Int at around 9pm-1am around the Venus store. She asks people who pass by for money to buy food at either Sheng Shiong or a 24h coffee shop at Blk 619. 

Does anyone know if she’s genuine or a scammer?? I find it strange that she’s always around so late at night. When she approaches me I ask her why she hasn’t gone home to sleep, and she doesn’t really answer. 

She has light brown medium length hair, and is usually slouched and wearing a mask. She speaks Chinese in a quiet voice usually. Sometimes she’s accompanied by a slightly younger lady who says she’s helping her find good people. ",12,1730911347.0,askSingapore,1,0.87,False

The suit follows, sharp and fitted, its lines exaggerated by the stilts strapped to my legs. 

The mask is last. It consumes me completely, as I slide into my role.

I leave the laptop on, the forum open. They wanted this, begged for a sign. Someone needed to give them it. I step out of the cabin. 

The woods stretch out, quiet.

The clearing isn't far, and there they are: three girls, their faces lit pale by the glow of a phone. They stand close, eyes fixed to the edges of the clearing.  

Only the tallest one sees me—a shape at the forest’s adjacent edge. She stiffens, clutching something to her side. I raise a gloved hand slowly, my fingers curling as if beckoning. She sees only what she’s been waiting for—what she wants to see.

She moves, fast. 

The knife flashes as she pulls it free. I freeze, staring from afar as the blade strikes downward toward the smallest girl, over and over. 

Blood splatters, her hand clutching at the wounds as she stumbles back, stunned by shock and betrayal. 

She somehow twists free, limping and scrambling into the trees, her cries breaking apart as she vanishes.

The other girl looks at her murderous friend, horrified, and runs. 

Her face is blank, and she is heaving, the bloodied knife hanging loosely in her hand. She looks at me across the clearing with awe, waiting for something I cannot give. It wasn't supposed to go this far.

I remain motionless, piss streaming down my leg, my body locked in place. She thinks I’m watching, approving. She bows her head slightly, then leaves, walking back into the woods without a word.

I rush back to the cabin, each step strained. The mask drops onto the table, the suit hangs neatly in its place, every line perfect. I sit on the edge of the bed, hands shaking as I take off the stilts. I do not sleep.

Morning brings gray light through the window. The shower burns the piss smell off. The coffee sits cold in my cup.

I open my laptop, scrolling out of habit, until the headline appears:

I failed the 1st attempts in Patent Bar with a 65% and deeply sad. I became sick after the exam exhaustion so writing after few days. Also took a break to refresh. Need all motivation, supports and study advise from this wonderful group. Specially ,I am unemployed and spending each penny with caution. Any advice regarding financing the exam expense second time is also appreciated.

This will be a long post -so I want to say sorry if I waste your time and want to give my big thanks to whoever replying and cheering!

**Few observations about the Test itself:**

1.     It is always said that lots of questions are from 700,2100. I did not notice that. Lots of other chapters are covered in actual questions.

2.     MPEP was not as fast as home definitely. Navigation main challenge is you need to press “Find” every time you search. Though I knew this ,many times, I was pressing “Ctrl+F” was thinking why not seeing anything. Not sure how to fix that habit in home practice-Any tips are preferred.

3.     I noticed question language are very convoluted compared to the practice exams in PLI.

4.     I marked question to recheck and also write the number in scratch paper. I had 1 hr. in AM and 40 minutes in PM to recheck but still I could not complete all questions I wanted to recheck. I was scared to not finish all question so finished them all  first giving 3-6 minutes time max each.

5.     Only 1-2 exact repeat questions and not exact repeat 2-3 from old exam.

6.     I guess some common items need to be memorized confidently otherwise its hard to even finish on time. Not everything you can look up in MPEP when MPEP is slow and inefficient and from an old stone age navigation.

7.Embeded links work in MPEP but slow.

 **Test Day itself**

1.     What I noticed is the test is hard not only because lots of material but also for its length and having AM and PM section. During PM section I was very tired and losing focus easily.

2.     The test place let you take transparent bottle of water. But if you keep drinking too much you will be easily feel urge to go to restroom -which is 15 -20 minutes waste of time considering checking time.

3.     The exam feels to be physically challenging if you don’t have a practice to do whole day exam.

4.     Test center people were nice. But it takes lot of time to check in.

 **Questions to whoever given the exam before and passed.**

 1.     I have completed everything in PLI course. I took the old exams (all 6 sections) 2 times and average scoring 75-80%. I also reviewed all practice exam questions answers and detailed explanation whether my answer is correct or not. But exam questions language itself looked quite different than old exams and PLI practice exam. What is the best way to use the PLI practice exam to ensure pass?

2.     I noticed for some questions I knew the answers but forgot at that moment and could not find it in MPEP quickly. Specially these are questions which you cannot spend much time and need to answer quickly to save time for the big descriptive questions. Any tips to sharp the memory?

3.      Managing my focus and energy all day long and especially PM section seemed one of the big challenges for me. I had headache and I took medication during lunch break. I was drinking less water because otherwise I will feel urge to go to restroom during test time which I cannot do for time crunch.  I ate a small energy boosting lunch and water and coke (did not go out for a coffee) to get rid of sleepy feeling. But not much work. Any helpful tips to break fatigue and keep energy whole day without having urge to go to pee (Gatorade makes me to pee more so avoided)?

4.     How will I know when to register for retake second time? How will I know I am ready? Will I need to get 90% in most PLI practice tests? Somehow my confidence became low as I completed each and every thing in PLI ☹

5.     OED mentioned to wait 30 days. Do I need to wait 30 days to reapply? Last time OED sent me a date range to schedule my test and said that I can take the exam only once between that range. Will I get another new one like that?

6.     Can I request PLI extension? It will expire soon. Is there a fee for extension?

7.     Is there any value to review my mistakes? It has a significant cost 261 dollars. Specially they will not allow you to record anything you need to just remember.

I am in lots of financial pressure and looking for a job too. I have some family to take care. So, managing time for study, funding the exam and scheduling or rescheduling if not prepared is pretty challenging. I am still trying to keep the dream intact to pass it -Please help me with your valuable tips!

- Title of the poem is A Wonderful Wish
- My sisters first name is Moana
- Not exactly sure the year she won, she is positive it was between 1999-2001.
- She was in elementary, Hayward Unified School Dist. in Hayward, CA.
- The prize for the top 3 winners was having their poem published in a book of poetry with other young poets, and a trip to Disney World in FL where they would be presented a copy of the book(if they didn't buy one already), a trophy or medal, and read their poem at some sort of celebration.
- She won first or second place, she knows it wasn't third because ""that doesn't count and she wouldn't be as proud"" 😆🤦🏽‍♀️
- The name of the book has Coffee or Coffee House somewhere in the title.
- Due to financial circumstances, our mom wasn't able to purchase a copy of the book or take her to FL

Any help on this would be GREATLYYYY appreciated!

So I complained to Amazon and they refused to ship a replacement because I think they know I'd just get the same machine again. I said I can't return it and buy it again as the price is much higher, and they said for a 1 time deal they'll compensate me the difference!

An hour later I get a refund notification that it's been refunded. Reason? ""Damaged in transit"". No request to return it...

But this friendship is unlike any other friendship that I usually experience. First of all I'm not gay or Bi in simple terms I'm straight.and within my knowledge I know that my friend is also straight. He is my workmate. We became friends because I really connect with him because of his experiences in life which is similar to mine. We often hangout play games and watch anime. 

We both talk about the past and very open to one another. Unlike to anyone, he's very open to me with his past experience including his past relationship which is to a girl. I also love to talk about how toxic my past relationship with my ex girlfriend. He never really moved on with his past so i kept giving advice and pushing him to try again. Though he really hated that. Our friendship we're really good. Not until he said that he felt like our closeness feels like a relationship thing. He complained that i am very clingy though i know that I was only clingy on a friendly level i never touched him the way i touch romantically. He also said that I'm like his past because him being very open to me saying that the only person that made him open up is his past. He also said that me and his past are the same in terms of our characters. But maybe because of our attachment style because we both have anxious attachment styles
.
 My friend is an avoidant and his past is an anxious attacher so just like any other relationship with these kind of attachment styles they encounter this anxious and avoidant trap. The common push and pull scenario. 

What i am wondering is why he sees me and treats me like his past. I feel the tension between us. My past is also an avoidant and also encountered that push and pull so i know the feeling so this is not a new experience. I also understand that avoidant attacher fears intimacy but I'm not being intimate with him.
I already talked about this with him. And clarified that i only see him as a friend and that i am straight. But he doesn't believe me.

 He always relates everything that i do with his past. Saying that what i am doing is similar to what his past did to him. Just like last time when I asked him out for a coffee. He said that the only person who asked him out for a coffee is his past. So whenever i asked him out. He always refuses because he feels like I'm trying to be romantic with him. Everything that i did feels like romance to him. Now funny how we are now experiencing this push and pull just like what we experienced in our past relationships. Which i find it weird because i did not do anything romantic to him. I just treated him like how i treated my other friends .Now we're in no contact and i just didn't know how to navigate this kind of friendship that feels like a relationship so i need your thoughts about this.I wanted to keep the friendship but i also hoping to make him understand that i don't see him the way he is insisting.

","My ex (M20) and I were together for about 3 years and have known each other for 8, weeks have always had some sort of romantic relationship through high school before fully committing to a serious relationship three years ago. In the end our relationship started to crumble and he was cheating on me with a girl he went to college with when we were 19, eventually I found out and ended the relationship. 

At first I wasn’t strong enough to leave completely and still saw him almost every day and gave the impression I was going to get back together with him, however I was still seeing other people and eventually “cheated” back on him. He found out and we slowly started to fizzle things out but not completely and couldn’t seem to stay away from each other. 


In the past couple of months I have met someone new (22 M), after the first time meeting things moved very quickly and we became very serious. This wasn’t my intentions as I was originally just looking to move myself away from my ex, but now I have found myself with strong feelings for the new person, he has expressed that he feels like he has fallen in love with me and I am “the first girl he feels this way about”. He’s the sweetest most genuine man I have ever met and shows me true respect and love, I can’t fault him, but at the same time something is telling me I am “the one” to him more because of the timing in his life where he feels ready to settle down rather than him being purely in love with me. 

After being away for a month my ex contacted me again telling me he has cut things off with other girls he had been seeing and can’t bring himself to do it and begging me for another chance. It had really thrown me off and I met up with him for coffee to speak but told him there would be no chances of us resolving things as I am happy with the new man.

I am just so confused and overall, am I throwing away a potentially great person by holding onto the past or will I always regret not trying again with my ex I can’t work out my feelings. ",0,1730909767.0,relationship_advice,6,0.5,False

1gl25yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1gl25yf/i_think_one_of_my_roommates_is_making_coliving/,I think one of my roommates is making coliving impossible so she can live by herself?,"I might just need to rant. I'm moving out next week anyway.

Okay, so I moved to an apartment with 5 rooms; it's rented by someone who doesn't live on the property. When I arrived, it was just a couple of guys sharing a room and a 20-year-old girl in another room. They seemed to get along really well. On my first day, I heard them joking about autistic people, later I heard the girl(that doesnt work or study) yelling with her mom on the phone, saying she was stupid and that she has to send her money, so I definitely knew these weren't my kind of people.

From my very first day, the sink was completely full of plates. The couple had a frying machine (not an air fryer, but something to deep fry food using real oil) that they would use almost every day, leaving the kitchen full of spilled oil. They all smoked together in the common area, which was obviously against the rules and made the apartment smell terrible the whole day. I never complained about these things because, well, if they were living like this before I arrived, I didn't want to be the problematic one.

Then the couple left, and it was just the girl and me, but our landlord told us that 3 guys were moving in to occupy the 3 free rooms we had. Two of the guys are much older (+40), and they are almost never home. Then there's this 18-year-old boy who's really hmm ""sassy"". I never had any direct problems with him.

The thing is, these two became good friends. They spend the afternoons barking (yes, like dogs) and laughing in the living room. I'm just saying this for context purposes, this is not the problem at all.

This girl sweeps the floor of the house every day, and when she sees a plate in the sink, she washes it. They decided to make the second toilet their own, printing a paper and taping it to the toilet door with their names (which would be fine if the friends she brings over didn't use the other toilet and ALWAYS left hair in the shower and used my shower gel). They tried to do the same with a bin just for the two of them, saying that the common bin was disgusting. But, none of them ever took the trash out, so after a week, they were back to using the shared bin.

Then, a few days ago, one of the older guys said he was using his own bin in his room and that it would be nice if someone could regularly take out the shared bin so the house didn't have a bad aspect (which I totally agreed with; I myself had been using my own bin in my room for two months). And wow, the girl just exploded.

She proceeded to type about how she and the sassy guy have to clean everyone's plates because, if they don't, the plates will stay in the sink forever; how they have to wipe the floor for everyone; and how the rest of us are making them look like idiots by making them do this (we all pay extra for a cleaning lady to come every week; no one ever asked them to do any of it).

She says they're the only ones who care about the apartment and its living quality, mentioning that when the lights went out (once, for 2 hours), no one moved a finger (what could we do other than tell our landlord?), and that the sink was clogged, so she and the sassy guy had to go out and buy products to take care of it (until she mentioned it, the 2 sinks we have were working completely fine. I had literally washed my plates that same afternoon and there was no problem at all). I told her that when she was living with her messy friends, she didn't seem bothered by plates staying in the sink for a whole week, nor did she seem worried about the living quality when she was smoking with them in the living room.

I think it's important to say that I've lived with people before. I ALWAYS clean up after myself when cooking and absolutely never leave any plate in the sink, unless I need to leave it with hot water to clean something better. I've never seen the sink with more than one or two plates, except when she and her friend cooks the night before, so I know the other guys are not making this big mess she talks about.

Also, everyone's food goes missing from time to time. This was a problem I had since my first week. Everyone, except her, has mentioned missing some food. Once, one of the friends she brought over was looking for something on one of the shelves that belonged to one of the older guys (absolutely everything had his name on it). This friend of hers then turns to me and asks if what she had in her hand was salt. I told her ""I don't know, but those are Room 4 guy's things."" She asks me, ""Hm? Who's this?"" and just keeps going.

Another problem is that we have a single motor for 3 of the AC units we each have in our rooms. Room 1 and my room have really big windows that absorb the sunlight and make the rooms feel like ovens, while the third room is hers, which is just a small room. The thing is, as long as she turns on her AC on the ""heat"" function, Room 1 and my AC will not work on the ""cool"" function. Room 1 and I mentioned it to our landlord, who proceeded to talk to her 3 times, suggesting that if she was cold, she should take the heater we have in the living room to her room and let us both use the AC. To this day, there are mornings where I have to leave my door open so I don't die because of how hot my room feels, because even though she can solve her being cold with the heater, she just turns on her AC and leaves me and Room 1 baking in our rooms.

Now, am I crazy to think this girl is literally trying to make living in the apartment impossible so she can have it all for herself and her friend like it was before? I swear to God, I washed my plates literally one hour before she complained about the sink not working. We have TWO sinks, and the photo she sent was of the sink full of pasta, claiming someone broke the sink after not cleaning up after themselves. I haven't eaten pasta in weeks; one of the older guys had been out since the week before, and the other one said he doesn't even have pasta among his food. After I replied to her acting out over small stuff, I woke up to my bag of apples suddenly disappearing the following morning.

There are also a bunch of minor things, like the fact that she moved my stuff out of the toilet they decided to share without even telling me about it, or the day I woke up and found my cup of coffee that I had left with hot water in the sink placed in front of my door (it happened to the guy next to me too; she left a dirty plate in front of his door). She's all about these micro passive-aggressive actions.

Thanks for reading.

1gl25f5,https://i.redd.it/b3r0e4l33bzd1.jpeg,SPIRIT OF SACRED POWER ,"In the expansive realm of demonology, one unpopular figure stands as both majestic and enigmatic,that is Demon SUSTUGRIEL,the sovereign of shadows, wields the scepter of transformation, beckoning souls to the crossroads of destiny.Through his darkened gaze, new beginnings emerge, where fear becomes courage, and chaos breeds clarity,he is a demon of high ranking and immense influence,demon SUSTUGRIEL is considered to be a teacher and keeper of esoteric and forbidden knowledge within hell,with a specific dominion over the arts,magic, sorcery, forbidden knowledge, wisdom and granter of familiar spirits and invisible magic protectors. He appears as a man with long robes sitted in a golden chair holding keys and a book,this would represent many things to a magician,to me,keys could mean he can open or lock any chapters and  circumstances in your life,the book signifies knowledge and power,he is said to give humans the unknown issues that they may not be aware about,he can pierce the dimensions of the future and see everything regarding someone's life both the past and the future ,he always has a commanding presence and a voice that echoes the sound of a multitude of waters.He is known to possess an intricate understanding of all arts and sciences, while also having the ability to reveal hidden and secret things to any ones he sees worthy of his teachings,he imparts knowledge about arts, science, and other occult subjects, demonstrating his vast intellectual capacity. Yet, his influence extends beyond this, bestowing dignity and conferring and confirming titles, enabling his followers to gain a certain level of recognition or prominence.He is also known for his ability to provide guidance on important matters, offering insights that can clear paths of uncertainties. He helps his followers in decision-making, empowering them with the clarity to make the right choices.Another beneficial powers is granting titles, bestowing honor and recognition. This aspect signifies his influence over matters of respect and societal standing,however, the most profound of all is his power to unveil the unknown. He offers knowledge about hidden things, opening up opportunities for personal and spiritual growth. This knowledge, however, should be sought and utilized responsibly.Not only does he command a vast number of  demonic entities, but he also possesses the ability to grant invisibility to those who invoke him, and endow them with wisdom, knowledge, and the capability to manipulate others. All these qualities make Demon SUSTUGRIEL an entity both feared and revered within the realm of demonology.

Below is a way to summon sustugriel

Summoning Demon SUSTUGRIEL requires a respectful and meticulous approach. Preparations involve crafting his sigil, usually drawn on consecrated paper and setting up a quiet, sacred space where you won't be disturbed. Cleanse the space of any negative energy with sage or do the lesser banishing ritual.During the summoning, Demon SUSTUGRIEL sigil should be held aloft. Clear your mind and focus your intent, visualizing Demon SUSTUGRIEL in your mind's eye. In a firm but respectful tone, call out his name, repeating it until you feel his presence.
Always remember, summoning should be done with respect and the right intent, understanding the implications and potential consequences of calling forth such a powerful entity.for example you could say as below during invocation with the summoning enn 

""O MAGNUM SUSTUGRIEL VENI SAPIENTIAM TUAM (enn)
  
Then when you feel his presence say 

""Dear Sustugriel,master and teacher of magic art and forbidden wisdom, I invoke your presence. Let your wisdom enlighten me and your power guide me. Come forth,accept me to be under your guidance and watch,allow me to gain knowledge in ways unknown to others,dear SUSTUGRIEL, from the depths of the shadow realms, make yourself known to me. SUSTUGRIEL, I respectfully call upon you,teach me and grant me the ability to understand magic on a deep level,bless me with magic familiars to protect me and guide me in my endeavors,may this ritual work to the greater good and benefit of both me ,you SUSTUGRIEL and everyone"".You can just craft your petition and ritual with what feels right for you but respectable to the spirit.

The planets associated with sustugriel are both Sun and mars,this means you can summon him either on Sunday or Tuesday,try to do so during the astrological hours of sun or mars to ensure a potent connection.Its important to remember both mars and sun are strong and melific planets,The astrological sign attributed to SUSTUGRIEL is Aries.In astrology sun is always exalted in Aries while mars feels free and functions best at aries,a cardinal fire sign,it's  characterized by assertiveness, initiative, and leadership—traits associated with SUSTUGRIEL persona. This signs association with this powerful spirit further underscores his dominant presence and the inherent power to instigate change and influence outcomes.

Let's talk about offerings
Offerings to SUSTUGRIEL often take a variety of forms. They may include libations of potent alcohol or the burning of specific types of incense, such as Dragon's Blood or Oudh, typically any insence associated with mars or sun will work well with him,Some practitioners may also offer gold to SUSTUGRIEL, or items symbolically related to the Sun or mars,I once made cinnamon tea mixed with ginger and honey and he appreciated alot.black coffee does work well because if it's attributes with planet mars.These offerings are gestures of respect and honor, serving to appease SUSTUGRIEL and garner his favor, however it's wise to negotiate with him because he might ask specific things for someone,for me he gave me information to share about him and place and stick seals in public areas.
My personal advice would be as follows regarding this spirit, he is ancient and wise,be straight to the point,know what you want and don't ask many things at once,work on on goal at a time and move to another goal,he's a teacher of the occult and this means like all teachers,once in a while he will test you,which is a good way to measure students performance and level of understanding,be ready for growth,he will pull out things that might not be useful in your life and it could be painful at the moment but in the long run you'll appreciate,he's a teacher of all things related to occult and forbidden knowledge to both beginner and advanced practitioners,for those who made a step of working with him will always find treasures they didn't know that existed in the first place.
I will attach two of the sigils for this powerful and ancient demon

1gl257o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1gl257o/aeropress_newbie_guidance_trial_and_run/,Aeropress newbie guidance trial and run,"Hi. I need some dire advice about which parts I may be doing wrong. When I do a the ""press"" at the end, and try the coffee, it tastes quite bitter, not a very pleasant taste... When I do somewhat of a pour over (in a different container) and just let the water ""soak"" through the beans, I get something very tasteless...  

  
These are my steps as to what I do:  

1) I'm currently using 3 different Starbucks beans (not simultaneously), Caffe Verona (dark), Pike Place Roast (Medium), Blonde Espresso Roast (Light)

2) I use a blender for all my beans, cause no grinder... (I know it makes a difference here, but I'd like to know why)  

3) I put 2 of those measuring cup spoons into my Aeropress, move it around to level it, 6 ounces of hot water into it, then stir slowly for about 10 seconds as per the instructions. Then, I slowly push down until I reach the beans, which for whatever reason only nets me half of a cup when I thought I'd get 1 full cup...  And of course it tastes bitter.  

\------  

As I mentioned up there, before my Aeropress came, I just used this random filter, I'm not sure from where. I put the blended beans in until about half way, and just pour hot water in. I don't push down as I can't so I'm just essentially running the hot water ""through the blended beans"" and I guess it's carrying whatever coffee it can into the cup? This resulted in almost no bitterness, but tastes like nothing. Tbh, the other one with the Aeropress method might not taste that different maybe, but the bitterness was so strong that I couldn't tell...  

  
\------  

My question: I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong. I'll be honest and say I'm not an avid coffee drinker like you who probably pays attention to every minor note. I'm mainly going down this route, because I've drank coffee for about 10 years (instant coffee I think like playmate or nestle or whatever), using creamer and like 3 spoons of sugar. I think it could be I'm too used to having it with sugar so I don't really ""like"" this new change.  

I'd like to be healthier and not use any sugar now in my coffee, so I opted for more quality coffee. But, I'm wondering if the coffee can ever taste as ""right"" as what I've been accustomed to. I'm not really sure the words to articulate my point, cause I don't think ""as good"" is the right term....  ",1,1730909648.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False
