1p3ppye,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1p3ppye/am_i_overreacting_about_my_roommate_crossing_a/,Am I overreacting about my roommate crossing a boundary of mine?,"Okay so bear with me I’m not really good at explaining things but basically am I overreacting about a situation that happened with my roommate. We’ve had multiple collisions in the past some I’m to blame and some she is but we’ve moved past a lot of them I’m just adding this to say that this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. 

A bit more background: I first moved into this 2 bedroom apartment and was living there alone with my name on the lease and then my landlord increased the price so I found a new roommate. My landlord is so greedy and said if the new roommate wants to add her name to the lease it will be extra $$$ so I told her don’t worry about it just pay me a deposit which was much cheaper than the price of your name being added to the lease and I’ll just keep my name of there. Me asking for the deposit was just insurance for me if anything happened she was on board. 

Anyways I’m not even sure if that’s relevant. But when she moved in we had a conversation about boundaries and one of my boundaries was that if she were to have guests over I would like to know about it before they show up. I have social anxiety and get really uncomfortable around groups of people especially ones I don’t know and I explained this to her and she was very understanding. I told her I’m never going to stop you having your friends over the least I ask is that I just know about it before they come so I can mentally prepare. We shook on it and agreed.

Over the years she has not respected this multiple times. I’ll wake up to random people in my kitchen and have a panic attack. I understand sometimes you forget or people just pull up but it’s happened enough times that I know she’s just ignoring a boundary I set. Which I think is a fair boundary I’m not trying to control her I just need a heads up for my mental. I’ve talked to her about it she said it wasn’t intentional but she’s going to make an effort to let me know every time. Spoiler alert: she doesn’t. Honestly it was on and off sometimes she would sometimes she wouldn’t. So to combat I just started asking her if she’s planning on having guests over and she would tell me yes or no. That actually worked. 

Now, yesterday she told me she’s having around 8 friends over I said thank you for letting me know. Then I asked will they be spending the night? Another boundary I set is that if people are spending the night I would also like to be aware. It’s a two bedroom apartment with one bathroom and now there’s 10 of us in a house…she has never had this amount of people over and I thought surely it will be impossible for 8 people to sleep here but I asked anyways. She said no. Couple hours later I go to the kitchen to get a drink and I see 4 people sleeping on a couch. Decided to assume the best and I asked her hey did plans change or something are they spending the night? She said no they’re taking a mini nap because they plan on going to get some food later this was around 2am. I said to her oh okay when they leave can you close the door quietly (she had a bad Habbit of slamming the door shut instead of just pushing it closed) - which I also talked to her about and she didn’t fully listen. With her it’s always on and off she sometimes follows through and doesn’t but it’s starting to really affect me. Anyways I fell asleep , woke up at 4am because the door was slammed shut. I checked their stories I saw they indeed to go out to eat so I was like okay cool they’re probably going to leave soon. I woke up at now which is 10am to 6 people sleeping on the couch!!!!!! And the living room is connected to the kitchen so I feel uncomfortable making my breakfast and coffee with random people in my space especially when I asked my roommate multiple times about this. I’m just really annoyed and I don’t know if I’m overreacting and I don’t know what to do. Please just give it to me straight of im being too uptight. I don’t believe I am because it was something I told her before she even moved in , after she moved in I said it again and even during her time living here which has been around a year. I feel like if you don’t want to respect a boundary just be upfront about this instead of pretending to. Idk ",1,1763806197.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

From the very beginning of the night, I made it clear that I would not be going to his place and that I would be returning to my own home. Since I was driving, I only had two glasses of alcohol and then switched to non-alcoholic drinks for the rest of the night.

At the end of the date, he kept insisting that I come to his place, and I kept refusing. When he dropped me off at my car, he asked if I could also give him a ride home and got into my car. I agreed. While we were driving, he brought up again that I should come upstairs for coffee after dropping him off. I said no again and told him clearly that I was going home. At that point, I started to feel uncomfortable with how persistent he was.

Once he realized I definitely wasn’t going to his place, he suddenly said, “Stop here, I’m getting out. I’ll walk home.” We were not close to his home at all. I told him not to get out and that I would just drop him off properly, but he insisted. So I stopped and he got out.

About ten minutes later, he started sending me voice messages repeatedly, saying I had dropped him off too far away, that he had to walk a very long distance and still hadn’t reached home. He said the night ended horribly and that it was a terrible date. He also claimed that if I wasn’t the type to sleep with someone on the first date, I should have said so, and added that he wasn’t even that interested in sleeping with me anyway.

After multiple voice messages, I finally replied: “I was going to take you home, but you chose to get out in the middle of the road. I assumed you knew a shortcut to your own place. I also told you from the beginning that I wouldn’t come to your house. My stance never changed.”

So, AITA for letting him get out in the middle of the road even though we weren’t close to his home? Should I have been more firm and insisted on dropping him off properly after telling him we were far from his place?",3,1763805821.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

1p3pl4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1p3pl4f/focus_isnt_a_skill_its_a_dopamine_game_and_youre/,"Focus isn’t a skill, it’s a dopamine game (and you’re probably losing)","Everyone talks about focus like it’s some stoic discipline you can brute-force. Like if you just plug your phone in the other room and drink black coffee, suddenly you’ll enter monk mode and write 2,000 words or finally open that Excel sheet. But that’s not how it works. Most people around me, especially in high-pressure knowledge jobs, aren’t lazy. They’re operating with fried dopamine systems.

This post is for anyone who beats themselves up for being ""lazy"" or ""unmotivated"". It pulls together what neuroscience, behavior science, and elite performance research actually say about why focus feels so impossible today. Not the garbage you see in TikToks telling you to wake up at 5 am and take cold showers for hustle culture points.  

The truth? Focus isn’t willpower. It’s chemistry. And the good news is, you can \*train\* it. Here’s what actually works, backed by research from Stanford, Huberman Lab, Cal Newport, Gabor Maté, and more.

\- Dopamine is not just the ""pleasure"" chemical. It’s the motivation and \*anticipation\* chemical. Dr. Anna Lembke, psychiatrist at Stanford and author of \*Dopamine Nation\*, explains we don’t get addicted to outcomes, we get addicted to the \*chase\*. Every scroll on TikTok is a dopamine lottery ticket. Every tab switch is chasing tiny novelty hits. Which means your brain learns to \*expect\* stimulation every 30 seconds. No wonder a 20-minute task feels impossible.

\- If your brain is constantly stimulated by dopamine-overloading activities (YouTube shorts, IG reels, Reddit, junk food), your baseline dopamine level drops. This is called ""dopamine downregulation"". Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says this is one reason why normal tasks feel ""boring"" or even painful because your brain’s reward system got hijacked by too much stimulation. Focus doesn’t feel good anymore because NOTHING feels good unless it’s hyper-stimulating.

\- The fix isn’t quitting dopamine. It’s \*resetting your sensitivity\*. This is why Huberman recommends a 30-day ‘dopamine fast’ not from everything, but from \*high-frequency novelty\*. It means: delay gratification, restrict short-term highs (social media, sugar binges, even background noise while working). Over time, your brain starts to ""upregulate"" its sensitivity again. Focus starts to \*feel\* rewarding again.

\- The 45/15 rule works better than Pomodoro. According to peak performance researcher Steven Kotler (\*The Art of Impossible\*), the brain needs about 20 minutes of uninterrupted effort to shift into flow state not 5 like Pomodoro fans think. But after about 90 minutes, mental energy crashes. So he recommends working in 45-minute deep blocks with 15-minute low-dopamine breaks (walk, journal, silence). That gives you dopamine regulation \*and\* recovery.

\- Start your day with “dopamine discipline”. First 60 minutes are sacred. No dopamine flooding. No phone, no social scroll, not even checking email. Instead: sunlight, movement, hydration. This stacks your brain to \*earn\* dopamine through internal rewards. Dr. Paul Conti (Stanford psychiatrist) argues that external dopamine is cheap, but internal dopamine builds long-term drive.

\- Novelty is not always bad. You can \*harness\* dopamine for focus by mixing in “intermittent novelty”  change work locations, listen to new (non-lyrical) music, or introduce a competitive timer. Your brain loves surprises. Brain scans from the University College London show that unexpected rewards spike dopamine more than predictable ones. Just make sure the novelty supports, not distracts.

\- Your inputs shape your chemistry. Diet and sleep aren’t optional. Low tyrosine foods (dopamine precursor) and poor sleep reduce dopamine receptor sensitivity. Magnesium, omega-3s, and regular movement support better dopamine regulation. Multiple studies in \*Nature Neuroscience\* show that even mild sleep deprivation cuts focus by up to 40% and weakens impulse control.  

\- Context beats willpower. The environment controls your cognitive load. From \*Deep Work\* by Cal Newport: willpower burns out fast, so you need to ""design for discipline"". That means: no more than 1 tab open. Pre-block all temptations. Set up a visual cue for your main task (notion doc open, post-it on screen). And use tech tools like Cold Turkey or the Forest app to automate restraint.

Focus is not some moral high ground. It’s a neurochemical state your brain enters when the environment, timing, and rhythms align. We’ve just been trained by bad platforms and worse advice to destroy our ability to access it.

You’re not broken or too weak. You’re just overstimulated. But chemistry can be rebalanced. And when you rebuild your dopamine system with intention? Focus becomes fun again. Not a punishment.",1,1763805690.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

Wantaaam!!!

I’m running a small mobility startup in Nairobi focused on safe, reliable transport for late-night workers. We’ve been running a pilot using electric vehicles, and the response has been very positive.

Right now, we’re at a critical point the business is at risk of shutting down this Monday unless we raise emergency funds. I want to be fully transparent and offer all verification privately to anyone interested in supporting.


What we do:

Our startup provides corporate carpooling/employee transport, mainly for night-shift workers who struggle with safe transport options after midnight.

So far we have:

Averaged 100+ bookings per night

Generated around KES 6,000 daily revenue operating only 3 hours per night

Completed multiple successful routes

Attracted interest from 3 additional companies, set to begin operations on December 1st


The demand and impact are real.



Current challenge:

Unexpected payment obligations + operational costs have created a cash gap. To continue operating and avoid shutting down, we need:

KES 350,000 by Monday

KES 700,000 by Friday next week


If we don’t raise this, we risk shutting down, losing credibility, and collapsing the upcoming company partnerships — undoing all the progress made.



How we’re offering transparency:

I understand this may sound unusual, so I’m offering full proof privately to anyone who wants it:

*Invoices & statements

*Revenue screenshots

*Proof of bookings

*Contracts/LOIs from interested companies

*Live video call verification

*Breakdown of costs

*anything else you might require.

Day at work experience for higher contributors  see first-hand how operations run


How we say thanks

We want to show appreciation for every contribution. Here’s our incentive structure:

Contribution	Reward/Incentive

KES 10–499	Thank you message + social media shoutout
KES 500–1,999	Arm band or coffee mug + thank you message
KES 2,000–4,999	Branded t-shirt + thank you message
KES 5,000–19,999	Hoodie + t-shirt + arm band + thank you + optional day at work
KES 20,000+	Equity/share offer + full incentive package + day at work + full transparency & verification


Even small contributions make a difference  every shilling counts.



How to help...

To protect the business and avoid scams, the payment link is shared only via DM.
If you’d like to contribute or invest, DM me and I’ll provide:

Till/payment link

Verification documents

Full breakdown of how funds will be used

How to book your day at work


Even sharing this post helps  spreading the word keeps operations alive.


Why this matters..

This isn’t just a business; it’s solving a real problem for people who otherwise have no safe transport options late at night.

We’ve shown traction and demand, and we’re close to expanding to new companies. We just need a temporary bridge to keep operations running.

Thank you for reading.

1p3pdrl,https://i.redd.it/orwb3rym5s2g1.jpeg,Can’t believe I’m already done with Book 4 of the series.,"The pages are filled with a lot of text and you don’t wanted to stop. The epitome of comfort read, those who read *Knausgaard* knows he doesn’t create just environment but rather paints a landscape, that you can feel it. The thoughtful, European-style essays that stood out in the earlier books, known for their deep insights and creative connections, are missing. Instead, everything is presented as scenes, one after another, which is very engaging but lacks the seriousness of the previous books. This suggests a more relaxed and joyful time in Knausgaard’s life. I really dig the part where he’s pouring coffee and nothing much is going on, but his description is so spot on, it’s like you’re right there, yes, that’s exactly how it is…

> **""I got up and went into the staff room, picked up the coffee thermos, and shook it. It was empty, I filled the pot with water, poured it into the machine, popped a filter paper into the funnel, measured five spoonfuls, and started the whole shebang, lots of spluttering and gurgling, the slow rise of black liquid in the pot, and the bright red eye.""**

Book Four primarily explores the transition from childhood to the liberty and partial accountability of adulthood. It centres on an 18-year-old boy with artistic inclinations that are both vague and ambitious, dressed in a white shirt, and black pants secured with a studded belt, stepping out from the confines of youth. There was intense sexual yearning, plenty of alcohol, very young girls with perfect figures, self-awareness, a hunger for life and excitement, and the adolescent male in his primeval glory. I was thinking to mention a famous author who mentions sex in his every book in a creepy way, but I’ve decided against it. Unlike others it was so real. 

There’s no denying **Knausgaard** live for Art & music. His deep affection for the subject matter is the primary reason I appreciate and fell in love with his writing. For instance, read this and judge for yourself:

> **“ If my memories were stacked in a heap of the back of my life’s trailer, music was the rope that held them together and kept it my life in position.”**

> **“ I never worked out what It was that possessed me when music possessed me, other than that I always wanted it.”**

It nothing astonishing or out of the blue, but growing up music was the essential part of my life. I know how it influenced me or shaped my mind or childhood per se. The writer describes the transformation of the countryside from darkness to light, creating a sense of movement and life. As dawn breaks, the darkness seems to recede, revealing elements like the rock wall Lihesten, the grey fjord, and the birches, which appear to advance. The mist returns in the morning, enveloping everything in grey and dampness, with fine drizzle and moist soil adding to the atmosphere.
Reading his book has undoubtedly made my life slightly easier.

1p3pb9z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3pb9z,The Adventures of the Mud Queen — Episode 8: “Seattle Spill Saga” (a.k.a. The One Where Gravity Wins Again),"By the time Friday rolled around, Lila Bellyton had accepted her fate in the universe:

If she wore a crop top,
if she stepped outside her house,
if she breathed near anything liquid, sticky, furry, or crunchy…

it was going to end up on her stomach.

At this point, even her friends couldn’t resist teasing her — even though none of them were at the National Dog Show last week.
Sophie Young even said:

> “Lila, honestly, your belly has seen more chaos than my entire dating life.”



Which was… a fair comparison.


---

A Free Trip? Oh No.

That Friday afternoon, Lila’s cousin Laurie showed up at her door practically vibrating with excitement.

“GOOD NEWS!” she shouted.
“Is it something clean?” Lila asked warily.
“Well…” Laurie hesitated. “Depends how you define clean.”

Laurie explained that her close friend Elena had extra tickets for a weekend train trip to her hometown, Seattle. Elena wanted to treat the girls — Laurie, Lila, AND Lila’s friend Sophie Young.

Sophie, who was a hardcore Starbucks fangirl, instantly said yes.

> Sophie: “Seattle? HOME OF STARBUCKS? COUNT ME IN.”
Lila: “As long as I don’t get messy this time.”
Laurie: “…Yeah… about that—”
Lila: “LAURIE.”



But it was already too late.
The plan was happening.


---

Departure: The Striped Disaster-in-Waiting

Saturday morning, Lila wore a cute navy-and-red striped crop top and red pants with a Chanel belt — stylish, clean, elegant.

She was determined:
“No spills. No splashes. No accidents. I am a normal adult on a train.”

Laurie and Sophie clapped dramatically and said it together:
“GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!”

They arrived at the station, dragging their suitcases, and boarded the train. People recognized Lila again. Some whispered:

> “Isn’t that the Mud Queen?”
“Omg she’s clean right now.”
“Bet it won’t last.”



Lila pretended not to hear them.
Sophie absolutely heard and immediately snorted.


---

Coffee Time… the Beginning of the Beginning of the End

Once the train started moving, Elena walked down the aisle holding four cups of fresh, hot, glorious coffee.

“Ladies! Hazelnut latte for Lila, matcha for Laurie, caramel macchiato for Sophie, americano for me.”

Lila accepted the cup very carefully.

“I swear if something happens—”

“Girl,” Sophie said, “we’re on a moving train. Something always happens.”

And oh boy… Sophie was not wrong.


---

The First Jolt

About five minutes in, the train hit a tiny bump.
Just a small, barely noticeable shake.

Laurie held her drink like a pro.
Sophie didn’t spill a single drop — probably because she was too busy taking photos of her cup like a true Starbucks fangirl.
Elena just laughed.

But Lila?

SLORP— SPLASH.

A perfect ribbon of latte spilled right over the rim, streaking down her crop top, down her stomach, and pooling in her bellybutton like it was a tiny coffee mug.

“NO. NO NO NO NO NO—” Lila gasped.

Laurie burst into laughter.
Sophie screamed laughing so loud the couple two rows back stared at her.
Elena covered her mouth but clearly lost the battle.

“LILA,” Laurie wheezed between laughs, “HOW DO YOU EVEN—”
“It wasn’t even a BIG bump!” Sophie added.
“This isn’t FAIR,” Lila muttered, looking down at her latte-soaked abs.

And of course…
Someone in the next car immediately recognized her and shouted:

“HEY! SHE DID THE POSE!”

Because of course she did.
Her arms were up.
Her eyes wide.
Her tongue halfway sticking out in panic.

Someone snapped a photo.
Someone else filmed.

The Mud Queen got new content within seconds.


---

Surrender to the Chaos

After wiping herself off (which honestly didn’t help much), Lila sighed.

“You know what? Fine. I give up. Let the universe win.”

And with that, she raised both hands, stuck her tongue out, and deliberately posed — latte stains and all.

Laurie: “SHE’S ACCEPTING HER DESTINY.”
Sophie: “POST THAT. POST IT NOW.”
Elena: “This trip is already worth it.”

People in the car clapped.
Someone shouted:

> “Coffee Queen! Coffee Queen!”



Lila groaned.
“Oh great, now I’m beverage royalty too.”


---

The Second Disaster (Because One Is Never Enough)

Later, after the chaos calmed, Lila tried drinking water instead, thinking it was “safer.”

The train turned a corner.
Her water bottle rolled.
And somehow — SOMEHOW — it flipped open and splashed her again.
Right across the stomach.

Laurie collapsed laughing.
Sophie pretended to interview her like a journalist:
“Miss Lila, how does it feel to have water betray you?”
Lila answered dramatically, “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Elena took another picture. “This is going in the group chat.”


---

Arrival: A Wet, Sticky Victory

When the train arrived in Seattle, Lila stepped off with a damp, sticky crop top and a shiny belly still glistening from all the coffee and water.

“Welcome to Seattle!” Elena said cheerfully.
“You look… caffeinated,” Sophie added.
“I look like someone dipped me in a Starbucks trash can,” Lila sighed.

A person on the platform pointed at her.
“OMG it’s her! Do the pose!!”

Laurie whispered, “Just do it. Resistance is useless.”
Lila: “Ughhhhh.”

And yes… she did the pose.


---

Epilogue: The New Nickname

By the evening, Twitter and TikTok had a new nickname for her:

“The Coffee Queen”
#MudQueenOnTheMove
#TrainSpillLegend

One fan edit even said:

> “She boarded as a passenger…
She left as a latte.”



Lila nearly threw her phone.

But deep down?
She couldn’t help but laugh.
Because at this point…

Being a mess was her superpower.

1p3payv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1p3payv/odd_nightmare/,Odd Nightmare,"So, i typically don't dream and if I do it's usually something that happens up to a month or two later and gives me wicked deja vu, or its a nightmare. I woke up from an odd nightmare and wanted tk share cuz it seemed really odd.

For reference, I haven't met Liv irl yet. They're one of my friends I'm moving in with next summer (I've met the other two IRL once before and have known one of them for ab 4.5 years). I don't particularly have strong feelings, but I do find Liv cute and wouldn't mind getting to know them better. But anyways on to wgat happened.

Fell asleep kissing Liv and then cuddling in bed. I woke up early to go get coffee but got lost. My headlights weren't working and I barely avoided a herd of dear I hadn't seen. I swerved and got out, yelling and scared because it was dark and there was a lot of shadows lile deer and bears. I found myself running back to the apartment (or dorm, i forget) wanting to be back in Livs arms. As i open the door, it then cuts to me driving again and realizing I was lost omw to a cafe i frequentee cyz ir was dark. I turned around in the middle of the road but turned to quickly and kost control of the car. I was swerving and went off the side of the road and off the side of a hill that didn't have a guardrail but should've, and hit a tree infront of someones house mid-air which resulted in an explosion and me dying. I saw the resulting explosion in 3rd person from a distance afterwards. And somewhere between the deer and starting driving again, there was a small unrelated segment where Liv and I went to school together and he was next to a building while texting before coming to the tennis courts to play while I was playing volleyball. It cut away after we flashed each other smiles and saw each other at the courts. The warmth and love felt real and for once, non-lustful in the kiss and cuddles. I swear I could've felt his warmth.

I have no clue what to make of this, to be honest. It may have just been a nightmare but ik sometimes they do actually mean things.",1,1763804639.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

me 21f and my bf 24m have been in a relationship for nearly 2 years.
my bf works food delivery by motorcycle and encounters madness everyday from asshole customers, road users, and service staff, which i completely understand the frustration behind it, on top of being on the clock to complete order number quotas to hit incentives, i have worked with him previously before a couple times and i understand it is a hard job. i too ride a motorcycle and i empathise with the many risks and frustrations caused by inconsiderate and hazardous road users that is a common occurence in our country

prior to this incident he has been unable to regulate his emotions eg. really really bad road raging in a foreign country by chasing a bike that brake checked us WITH A CAR and lane splitting through heavy traffic, at one point banging into another vehicles mirror. another time riding through an immigration checkpoint where our passport faced a malfunction and the immigration officer who assisted us asked him to politely get down from the bike and push it to the office, my bf being very overworked and not rested tried to pester the officer to let him just ride to the office but the officer politely said no and he had to follow SOP (my country is very strict with immigration) and he immediately and loudly responded with ""SOP, SOP, FUCK YOUR SOP"" and a few other occasions, these have left me feeling unsafe as he cant regulate his emotions and lashes out, especially since he wants to have children, how would he treat me or the kids in the future? i have spoken to him nicely about this on multiple occassions to the point it got ugly and we fought over it, to his credit he improved, but only when i was physically together with him.

3am in the morning he collects and order from macdonalds and the app stated the order was ready. he had collected the food but not yet the drinks which was sitting on a tray just barely out of reach from the counter. the service staff was making drinks for other orders when my bf called out to him to ask him to help push over the tray a little so he could take his drink order and be on his way, the staff told him to wait. this persisted for 2 mins of him asking the staff and the staff telling him to wait or ignoring him. finally he asked the staff one last time while the staff was waiting to fill a cup of coffee and the dialogue went something like this

""bro can you just help me to push the tray forwards a bit then i can take already""
""you can wait right, im doing something now right""
""it's just pushing the tray only, how long more do you want me to wait for you to do your things""
""its no my problem""
""NOT YOUR PROBLEM THEN DONT WORK HERE"" (loud enough for a macdonalds at 3am and all its patrons to hear)

when my bf told me this, my immediate response was 

""you shouldn't have shouted at him tf, i get the frustration but you dont need to be an asshole, you need to go for therapy"" 
""i waited 2 mins for a 2 sec job i was patient i asked nicely 2 times""
""if you say so but it doesnt give you the right to make a scene, i get the frustration of waiting and time is money to you but im not justifying his attitude either, everytime you tell me you want kids but you treat service workers like shit, this is pissing me off""
""tf you on bro""
""if you keep this up, idk how im gonna be with you already, do u have no patience at all, i have to gentle parent you through this?""

he proceeded to immediately forward a selective chain of the above messages to a mutual friend group chat (friend group a) consisting of his best friend, and his best friend's girlfriend (who was my friend prior to their relationship, i essentially matchmade them). previously he told me he hates airing dirty laundry after he assumed i told my own group of close friends (friend group b) but continuously breaks this boundary he laid by telling his mother, his sister, his friends whenever we fight but i digress. in retaliation i proceeded to send the entirety of our conversation to the group chat and his best friend's girlfriend responded by trying to calm us both down and mitigate the situation.

i proceeded to not engage for awhile and during that time sought counsel from my own friend group (friend group b) and his best friend's girlfriend. all parties agreed my stand was not outrageous, and his reaction was unwarranted despite also empathising and validating the emotions behind the reaction, they do not agree nor justify this behaviour, DID NOT INSULT HIM AT ALL SIMPLY POINTED OUT THE FACTS AND THEIR DISAGREEMENT

for context, i am more progressive and i believe that both men and women contributes to a relationship, simply put reciprocating and equity
my bf thinks more traditionally in terms of needing to take care of the lady, more traditional gender roles, which i have no issues with as long as my effort/love is reciprocated in a way i can feel it
i started sending a bunch of ig reels from my page promoting healthy masculinity (how to take care of your partners emotional needs, why your wife does xxx and you will feel xxx you need to change kind of content) and he got triggered the conversation is as follows

""stop sending me those ig reels they aren't constructive to our relationship they dont apply to our relationship""
""do you ever realise the shit i send you aligns with YOUR values and not mine in the first place""
""like what being responsible and taking lead? which i do take lead in the relationship and am responsible?""
""more like your role as my partner, and being responsible of taking care of your emotions or mine either?""
""how?""
""not regulating your emotions and you cant check yourself""
""i asked 4 different people yesterday and none of them condone your actions""
""i did too and everyone i asked said my actions were valid""
""are they emotionally intelligent?""
""they are also delivery workers""
""delivery workers ≠ emotional intelligence""
""maybe that's why you can't sympathise""
""everyone i spoke to validated and empathised with your emotions and reasoning they simply didnt condone your outburst""
""outburst? i said i raised my voice a bit not shout at him?"" (he literally did)

i proceeded to forward all the chats with my friend group b and he responded

""bro just stfu, all you do is make remarks i dont want to hear, everytime you whine and yap about your misfortunes i just keep my opinions to myself even though you were in the wrong, all i wanted was for you to comfort me""
""all you do is protect your flawed ideals, i dont validate this behaviour, and when i whine to you about my unfortunate situations in my day, i do not react like you did, i will either disengage or politely but firmly stand my ground""
""maybe thats how you cope but so many people step on delivery workers, cant i just have it over and done with?""
""yea you cant because you arent supposed to react like this?""
""just ask your friend to stfu shes blowing this out of proportion for what?she literally made a hypothetical situation and then proceeded to get you to think about it""
""she simply added on to my point about my worry for the future and not once did she insult you as a person or your character, she simply disapproved your actions, to add on you react to this situation by throwing your temper, if this happens to me i would definitely feel frustrated but at most this might warrant a 'bro ive been standing here for so long and you can't just help me push a tray towards me a little? im also on the clock'""

intermission because he continues being busy with work for at least 4 hrs and i told him to reply me before my shift started, which he didn't until a whole hour AFTER my shift ended and made me more pissed 

""i dont know how my reaction to a stranger made you feel unsafe, i sent it to our mutual friends and no one else, why must you even send your friends, and if they never worked as a delivery person before how can they empathise with what i feel at all?""
""either u have 0 emotional intelligence or you are in denial idk which and, CONSIDERED you literally told ME you hated airing our laundry""
""because i was shocked you were making it such a big thing, this small thing lead to me being a bad father in the future, where is the correlation? how can you say how i treat you based on how i treat a stranger, so if someone insult me in public i beat them i do the same to my girlfriend?""
""literally everyone but you can see it, i literally broke everything down for you and its not even my place to be explaining everything to you""
""the most you can do is just tell me i shouldn’t do that, why must you go behind my back and ask your friends""
""i did and you took that as a personal offence""
""then it’s my choice to listen to you or not, my own situation my own choice doesn’t affect you at all, you ask people who never worked delivery job before to comment, it’s dumb, i’m just sick of giving in to you""
""not one of them said ur job was easy, they all validated and empathised with you, also I'm not entertaining this conversation anymore im talking to a brick wall, no emotional intelligence, empathy, or perception""
""so next time my family gets pushed around in public i should accept it?""
""standing your ground vs being an asshole doesn't have a thin line, did you even read anything i sent you, I'm not entertaining you anymore im talking to a brick wall""
""then just keep your opinions on this matter to yourself, the issue is closed""
""no? i have clearly given up educating you but that doesn't mean you have resolved my sentiments?""
""but you have given up already""
""open your eyes a bit bigger and read everything i sent you if you did you wouldn't be saying that i asked you to suck up to someones attitude and take it""
""it’s still my own choice and decision to act how i want to a situation which doesn’t even involve you, stop forcing your opinion and idea down my throat, if i want to behave like that it’s my own problem, don’t you see you’re controlling?""
""they aren't opinions or ideas they are values and morals and i don't want these kind of values and morals in my partner, are you going to change or not? keep in mind i have changed mine for your sake multiple times even though i disagreed with it and im not expecting you for some outofworldly shit my expectations really aren't that high""
""you say your expectations aren’t high, who are you to even determine what’s high and what’s not?""
""so you cant cope with me wanting to have a morally upright partner""
""if it’s our problem i would react differently, this situation involved me solely, and you want to control how i react?""

this is the part where i start pulling up receipts from the prior incidents where he couldn't regulate his emotions in a situation that i was present in (par.3) his response is as follows

""why do you like to bring up other things, stop correlating them, you don’t believe i can change, i don’t mess up anymore, you see you’re just so desperate to fault me again, put me in the fucking spot light, fault me, but when want money"" (i believe he was implying that in a gold digger here because i chased him back for 20 bucks i desperately needed to fix my bike but was still another 20 bucks short so i had to borrow from him)
""so you're victimising yourself now, self pity much? the point is you were not able to regulate your emotions happened even when i was not with you which means you still dont properly regulate your emotions, which leads me to feel unsafe""
""no? when im with you, i act differently, stop blowing it up, people ignore me when im working so I'm just supposed to be stepped on?""

basically the conversation proceeded to go in circles after this so i will stop here

Now I realise it’s been because I never had to share much with her or spend much time with her-had very surface level relationship. She is the kind od person that has 2 sides. One is extremely controlling, giving advices about anything, considering you not equipped for life, literally the whole convo with her is her giving you lectures about life and asking you private questions about your life that she has nothing to do with (e.g. Did you pay your bills, how much do you earn), and whatever answer you give her she is ready to lecture how thats a bad way to do it and you should do this instead. When the baby arrived it was awf-millions of unsolicited advices, overbearing me sooo much and almost convinced me I am not producing enough milk until the lactation nurse checked me and told me I should feel blessed for having this much milk this early-sometimes I even felt she is envious because she wasn’t successful with breastfeeding. The other side of her is this supposedly nurturing side, like she will do things for me, hug me out of the blue, massage my head when it hurts, make me tea etc and because of these things I find it hard to hate her even though my feelings gravitate towards that especially after my baby. When I gave birth to my kid she came with my husband to pick me up and in the car she asked me “what is his poop like”(?!) I said green she immediately told me that baby is hungry with the harsh voice. He wasn’t, he was just born and I was just staring breastfeeding. Like wtf is this interaction even?! Post partum days were hell to the point I told my husband to tell her to go. She immediately started checking my baby down there for any signs of infection because he is not circumcised (3 days old) and when i told her stop pulling his skin that harsh she said aggresively -move away I did this before-. In the days that came I snapped one time told her to leave me alone with my baby because she would come and press herself onto my naked body multiple times without any regard for me so she could watch baby breastfeed. I said to leave me alone I am his mother and she told me “fuck you stupid woman you should visit psychiatrist”. I guess I will never forget that esp since she never apologizes for anything. Two months later she would come and say that she is ready to get him circumcised  (?!) and I snapped again told her that is none of her business. But the thing about her, she would never accept accountability, she just goes “I never meant it like that, you are crazy for thinking that way about me, you got it all wrong, are sou crazy” and then she is the one that gets hurt somehow. E.g the other day she was walking the baby and put him on his own holding the chair and he fell head down almost hit his head and neck on the heater tubes. When I picked him up because he was crying she attacked me from taking him from her and asked why I did that. I am his mother, I wanna comfort him. She goes. You just wanna say I did it on purpose and she literally had a fight with herself yelling snd all-I never raised my voice or said much. I forgot to mention we started living together like a month ago so now I have to share space with her. She of course never apologized for that but (now comes her 2nd personality) rather started acting at service to me. I was sick so she made me tea and coffe in the morning, she would always ask me how I am, how my mom is, rubbed my head because I was terribly sick. And genuinely she is generous, she reaches out to me and asks how i am even when we didn’t have baby and didnt live together she buys me stuff and geniunely I think she cares of cared about me. My husband is irritated by her most of the time but he loves her of course and he had lot of arguments with her putting boundaries for us even though he shares my opinion just wont act on it very much. He is always like”we will talk to her”. And we do but things don’t change much. I have to mention she never cheers him on (he started family bussiness recently), never is positive about him, never tells him she is proud of him but rather puts him down any chance she can, like telling him he should do it differently and that he is not ready for somethig, wont be able to do something etc. She always wants well though-at least what she says and what my husband believes its just her delivery that is wrong. I am not sure about anything anymore. I am really torn about my feelings for her and I blame myself when I snap at her even the slightest but sometimes I think she deserves it. She also have this weirdly competitive and hateful attitude towards females- before I moved she gave me a lecture about how I have to wear different clothes when I move in with her because I wear tempting clothes and that has to change because neighbours will laugh at me(I don’t wear tempting clothes, I am half naked in my home sometimes because I breastfeed fairly often), she just thinks someone will laugh at her for having a DIL that is half naked at home because her female friends stop by for coffee here and there. Ugh. It would be easier to hate her if she didnt have these moments of compassion and care or whatever they are.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I've crossed off a few things i already considered getting him:

 Perfume(his rich friend gave him an expensive one). A unique  style lighter(friends gave him like 5 already. Any puzzles and games, i've considered flowers but he doesn't like money being used on ""useless"" things

He doesn't really like going anywhere unless his friends bring him to drink coffee nearby

He likes certain breads, and certain crackers but is pretty picky, he doesn't eat much sweet things other than the occasional offered candy and he enjoys soda. But it feels a little odd to give food and sweet drinks as a birthday gift",2,1763804257.0,AskMenAdvice,11,1.0,False
1p3p7eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machupicchu/comments/1p3p7eg/salkantay_trek_unguided_no_accommodations_things/,"Salkantay Trek unguided, no accommodations - Things I didn’t know","Hi everyone, I did the Salkantay trek with a friend in Sept. 2024. We did it solo and unaccommodated, meaning no guides, porters, or rented tents/hostels along the way. We carried our own tents and sleeping bags, but we did buy food along the trail. 



As I was preparing for the trip, I found some posts from people who did the trek solo/unguided ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1cddzbi/salkantay_trek_self_guided_march_2024/) [2](https://www.machupicchutrek.net/solo-salkantay-trek/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/vs2y2j/salkantay_trek_unguided/) [4](https://www.thehikinglife.com/2017/10/salkantay-trek-independent-hikers-guide/)), but most of them were staying in hostels or rented rooms along the way. I had trouble finding resources for trekkers who were carrying their own camping equipment, so despite my best preparations, we did encounter some hiccups along the trail as trekkers without accommodations. I’ve been meaning to write this post up as a resource for future unaccompanied trekkers. I will try to keep the post to (mostly) info and advice I didn’t find elsewhere in my pre-trip research. I’d also be happy to hear from anyone whose experiences differed from ours. 



Bringing our own tents offered us more freedom in where we spent the night. Rather than following the typical Soraypampa > Chaullay/Colcapampa > Playa > Aguas Calientes plan, we took an extra night and mostly stuck to the in-between spots with fewer or no other people. Here’s a day-by-day itinerary:



**Day 1: Cusco to Soraypampa**



We caught a colectivo from [this intersection](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nFt1yyGyNKxouUkNA). Just stand around looking confused with your backpacks and someone will come up to offer you a ride. The drive cost 45 soles for both of us and took 3.5 hours with a stop to pay the entrance fee. We originally were going to disembark at Challacancha but the driver would have charged us the same amount, plus we had gotten a late start, so we went all the way to Soraypampa. I would do it that way again.



FOOD: This was the first unpleasant surprise of the trip. Every guide I found said that we would have no problem getting food at a hostel in Soraypampa. This was unfortunately not the case. There was one lady selling skewered meat by the trail when we arrived but she had left by dark. Around dinnertime we started walking around looking for a place to eat. We were turned down by all three places that we found serving food; they will only serve people staying at the hostel to which they are attached. We ended up having to just eat a bunch of the dried snacks we brought. It was just a big surprise based on what I had previously read.



WATER: There's a shop at the trailhead to Humantay Lake. The water is overpriced but not egregious, however the prices get much worse between here and Chaullay. If you must buy bottled, do it here. We had iodine tablets and purified some at Humantay Lake. If I remember correctly this is the last convenient spot to get water until just past Salkantay Pass.



CAMPING: We brought our tents with the intention of not having to pay for lodging, but the locals will charge about 10 soles per tent to set up anywhere near the trailhead. There were also a lot of dogs barking near the spot we chose. If I did it again I would continue about a mile into the trail and find a free flat spot to camp.



**Day 2: Soraypampa to just past Huaraymachay**



Huaraymachay doesn’t look like much on first approach but it gets a little busier as you go further past the sign and first booth. We were also there later in the season which may have explained the lack of activity.



FOOD: We had heard that there was food in Huaraymachay, which was true, but it was hard to find. After the terrain flattens out the first thing you run into is a trailside booth selling dried snacks. She told us there wasn’t any hot food to be had in the town but as we kept walking we asked a random lady and she took us into her backyard and cooked for us at 10 soles apiece. We were in a major caloric deficit at this point so the food hit the spot AND she let us use her toilet AND refill our water at her spigot so she was no doubt the MVP of the trip. I would not confidently rely on finding a meal in Huaraymachay, but if you want food, ask every local that you pass and you might get lucky.



WATER: The first water we encountered was flowing freely out of a tube sticking out of a rock just over the Salkantay Pass. After that you will follow the river for a while but the higher you filter it, the better, since livestock will be grazing as you approach Huaraymachay. As mentioned above we also refilled at a spigot offered by one of the ladies in town.



CAMPING: After the town the trail descends into the jungle. We walked for 2 miles, occasionally passing improvised campsites off the trail, most of which only seemed big enough for one tent. We eventually settled on a large open space to the right of the trail which ended up being a grazing spot for the burro trains (as we found out soon after setting up camp). 



**Day 3: Past Huaraymachay to Lluscu Mayu**



Once you reach Chaullay/Colcapampa you will have to make the call to follow the trail on the left side of the river, or the road on the right side of the river. If you plan to camp before the road and the trail merge at Playa Sahuayaco, take the trail. If you are doing Chaullay to Playa in one day and want an easier trail, take the road. You will miss out on the cute farms on the other side of the river but the trail is gruelingly up-and-down at times. 



FOOD: Lunch in Chaullay (just ask around), dinner at our camping spot in Lluscu Mayu (see below).



WATER: Available for purchase in Chaullay/Colcapampa. Reasonably priced now that there is connection to a road. No river access but locals might let you use their spigots.  
  
CAMPING: We planned to camp at Churubamba but were forced to turn around due to encountering a minor rockslide on the trail right as it was getting dark (this was 2024, so no idea how it’s doing now). A lady at Lluscu Mayu (shows up on AllTrails, but not Google Maps) gave us dinner and a lawn to crash on for 10 soles each. There are at least 3 or 4 small properties between Chaullay and Playa where you’d be welcome to pitch a tent for a small fee, but I’m not sure that all would offer a hot meal.



**Day 4: Lluscu Mayu to Llactapata**



Another family member arrived on the property in the morning, and we found out that they owned a pulley system that spans the river. We paid him to ferry us across rather than deal with the rockslide. Got some dope photos.



FOOD: There are signs for food as soon as you reach Sahuayaco Playa, it won’t be hard to find. Llactapata, where we camped, also offered food.



WATER: Purchase in Sahuayaco Playa or Llactapata. I don’t remember if there is river access.



CAMPING: This was my favorite campsite of the trip. We paid 15 soles per tent for an incredible view of Machu Picchu and the surrounding mountains. Absolutely stunning. However, our Peruvian friend was a cheapskate and continued on the trail to find a free campsite. He ended up hiking another 5 minutes to the Llactapata archaeological site and sleeping there (for free).



**Day 5: Llactapata to Aguas Calientes**



Pretty self-explanatory from here on out. One thing I will add-- about 10 minutes’ walk from the train station, before you cross the green bridge, there is a house (not on Google Maps) on the left side of the trail advertising coffee for sale. We stopped in there and had a lovely chat and coffee with Claudia and Pepe, the couple that lives there. Claudia showed us around her garden and Pepe played us some music from some woodwinds he had carved. It was awesome! Stop in if you can.



FOOD: Breakfast available at Llactapata. We ate lunch at a restaurant at the train station, and dinner once we arrived in AC.



WATER: Refill at the train station.



CAMPING: n/a



Other general advice that I didn’t hear anywhere else

* Bring small bills. This should have been obvious to me but people won’t want to break 50 or 100 sol bills out on the trail. Break them up in Cusco.
* The selection of “trail snacks” seemed limited in Cusco, so if you have any favorites I would pack them with you rather than expecting to find them there. I had trouble finding trail mix and dried fruit but maybe I was looking in the wrong spots. 
* Many of the people who live along the trail speak Quechua as a first language, Spanish second, and English third if at all. Keep that in mind especially if you are a native Spanish speaker. We walked with a local Peruvian for part of the trail (hi Ali) and he was awesome but he slurred his Spanish like crazy. I had the semi-entertaining experience of him trying to communicate with a Quechua lady and she was struggling to understand his Spanish as much as I was! 
* Moleskin is an essential for me on any hike, but I was all out as I was packing. No problem, I’ll just buy some in Cusco, right? WRONG! There is NO moleskin in the entire city of Cusco!! I checked!!!



**TL;DR: If you are not staying at hostels along the Salkantay Trail, it is near impossible to find hot food at Soraypampa, and difficult at Huaraymachay. Everywhere else, ask and ye shall (probably) receive. Water-wise, treat Soraypampa to Salkantay Pass, then Salkantay Pass to Chaullay like dry spells unless you want to pay a lot for bottled water. You must pay to pitch your tent if you’re on/near someone's property, but I had luck walking an extra 0-2 miles past and camping trailside for free.**



Again, happy to hear from others especially if your experiences differed. Maybe things are totally different during the busy season. Sorry if a post like this has been made recently-- I haven’t been keeping up on this sub since I finished my trek. If I remember anything else, I’ll add it to the bottom of this post. This trip was one of the coolest experiences of my life-- thanks to this sub for providing so much useful info!

That night, Rosalie opened the door and threw my daughter's tiny corpse inside.
And I burned.
When I opened my eyes again, I was face-to-face with Leonardo, who was cleaning up the evidence. I forced myself to stay calm despite the searing pain.

Chapter 1
To move Isabella Carrington's grave to New York, I went with my husband on a business trip.
I hadn't expected that the moment we separated, I would return to my former home only to see Leonardo Carrington walk in—his arm wrapped tightly around Rosalie Whitmore.
The moment he saw me, a smug smile spread across his face. ""See?"" he said loud enough for everyone to hear. ""I told you. Three years gone, and Juliette still waits at home for me.""
A few of his friends couldn't resist teasing. ""Quit flaunting it,"" one of them snickered. ""Everyone knows Juliette only has eyes for you.""
Another chimed in, ""She kept your bed empty for three years. Tonight, you'd better make it up to her.""
Leonardo didn't even blush. Instead, he chuckled, punched his buddy lightly on the shoulder, and strode confidently toward me with open arms.
""Honey, have you missed me?""
The shock snapped, and just before he pulled me into his arms, I shoved him hard.
""We're already divorced,"" I said firmly, voice trembling with restraint. ""Please, keep your distance.""
His expression faltered for a split second, then he burst out laughing even louder, as if my words were some amusing joke.
""Alright, alright,"" he said, still laughing. ""I get it. You're still angry about the divorce.""
""But I only divorced you because I lost that bet, didn't I? We're going to remarry tomorrow.""
Rosalie rolled her eyes and scoffed. ""You've been gone three years since the divorce. Maybe she has already married someone else.""
Leonardo's face darkened at her words. ""Impossible. The house is the same as it was three years ago, spotless, unchanged.""
""She and Bella must be waiting for me.""
At the mention of Bella, my fingernails dug into my palms.
He had left this house to me in the divorce.
It was filled with the sweetest memories of Bella.
I couldn't bear to sell it, not even after moving to New York. I kept someone coming to clean it regularly.
I hadn't expected he would twist that into... this.
Bella's face—twisted in pain in her final moments—flashed before me.
The sight of Leonardo and Rosalie standing here together made something dark and poisonous curl inside me.
Rosalie shot Leonardo a look, impatient. ""Alright, fine,"" she said dismissively. ""You're very charming.""
She tossed in a casual tone, ""But I'm starving. When are you going to cook me some soup?""
Leonardo looked sheepish. ""Julie, Rose is picky and didn't eat on the plane. Why don't you make her some soup?""
A cold shiver ran down my spine.
When Leonardo was home, he insisted on having soup every single day.
Once, I had a high fever and could barely sit up, yet he still woke me early to cook.
I hadn't even taken a sip myself when he poured all of it into a container and left for work.
I thought he just really loved porridge.
Later, I learned that the soup I made went straight into Rosalie's stomach.
All my grievances, all the pain over Bella's cruel and sudden death, burst forth in a surge of rage and sorrow.
I slapped Leonardo hard across the face and screamed, ""This isn't your home anymore. If you want to eat, go somewhere else!""
The moment those words left my lips, Rosalie lunged forward and shoved me hard.
""So you won't cook, fine! But did you have to hit him? Lunatic!""
Caught off guard, I crashed to the floor, trembling in pain.
Pain shot up my spine as I struggled to get up, bracing against the coffee table. Gabriel Blackwood, one of Leonardo's friends, picked up the papers lying on the table.
""Grave relocation? Whose grave is being moved?""

Chapter 2
Leonardo shot me a look full of disgust, snatched the contract out of my hands, and tossed it straight into the trash.
My fingers shook with anger. I was about to grab it back when he caught my wrist.
His brow furrowed hard. ""Juliette, your parents are both alive and well. Whose grave are you even trying to move?""
""Stop dragging all that bad luck into the house.""
I glared at him. ""Of course it's for Bel—""
""You two never quit,"" Rosalie cut in before I could finish. ""I just got back and you're already fighting.""
""If I'm not welcome, I'll just leave.""
Her face was icy as she yanked her suitcase toward the door.
Leonardo's expression shifted instantly. He jerked free of me and lunged to stop her.
""Your place isn't even ready yet, and you're a total neat freak. Just stay here tonight.""
Sensing the tension thick in the air, Gabriel stepped in to break it. ""Juliette, Leo finally came back. Don't drive him off again.""
""Oh, and where's Bella? Get her out here to greet her dad, or Leo really won't remarry you. Bella will end up fatherless.""
I was so furious I actually laughed. ""Who the hell wants to remarry him? I'm already married.""
But my words drowned beneath their useless attempts to smooth things over.
Leonardo steadied himself and stepped closer. ""Why hasn't Bella come out yet?""
My throat tightened before I could stop it. ""She... she's gone...""
He froze, then let out a short, incredulous laugh. ""Bella's six now. She should be in school.""
""Which one? Let's go pick her up, take her out for a big dinner.""
I stared at him, disbelieving, pitying Bella for having a father like this.
Leonardo had never been careless.
But now, he couldn't even see the grief in my eyes.
Back then, if Bella or I so much as caught a cold, he'd panic and rush us straight to the hospital.
He'd always call in the best doctors to check on us.
But once Rosalie came into the picture, he turned into someone I barely recognized. All his tenderness and all his care belonged to her.
He even let Rosalie hurt me and Bella.
I'd fought him over it countless times, but he always shut me down with the same excuse.
""Rose's boyfriend died saving me. Taking it out on you two is her right.""
""Just bear with it, for my sake.""
That decision cost me Bella.
Pain shot through my chest like a spasm, and just then, Rosalie leaned closer.
""Juliette, you're still the same as three years ago. Angry over every little thing.""
She turned to Leonardo, her voice sharp with annoyance. ""You begged me to stay here just so I could deal with her attitude?""
""Do you think I'm lowly and pathetic?""
With that, she spun on her heel and walked out without looking back, her face cold as stone.
Leonardo gave me one last look, disappointed and detached. Then, he hurried after her.
Once they were gone, their friends exchanged uneasy glances and quietly slipped away too.
Every look they gave me was laced with blame.
I stood there for a long time before finally pulling out my phone and putting the house up for sale.
Maybe I should've done it years ago and cut Leonardo out of my life for good.

Chapter 3
On the day of the grave relocation, I hesitated for a long time before finally calling Leonardo.
When the call connected, I took a steadying breath. ""Leonardo, are you coming to Bella's grave relocation?""
His voice came through sharp with irritation. ""What grave relocation? I've got real work to handle. Can't you stop being so dramatic and calling me over nonsense?""
The line went dead before I could even respond.
I let out a short, bitter laugh. Of course. I should've known better.
After the staff handed me the urn, I held my daughter close and turned to leave.
I'd only taken a few steps when a voice I knew all too well floated over.
Instinctively, I turned, and there she was. Rosalie. Smiling, nestled comfortably in Leonardo's arms.
""Leo, you really spoil me,"" she said in that sugar-coated tone. ""You actually ditched a deal worth hundreds of millions just to come with me to visit my dog's grave.""
I froze.
So this was his ""important business.""
This cemetery had the best place in the city. It wasn't somewhere money alone could get you in.
To have Bella buried here, I'd called in every favor, emptied my savings, and begged until I finally secured one spot.
And yet Rosalie's damn dog was buried here without a hitch.
My chest felt tight, suffocating.
I turned to leave quietly, but Leonardo stepped into my path.
""Juliette, you never fail to surprise me,"" he said, voice dripping with contempt.
""I try to make peace, and you give me attitude.""
""I stay at a hotel for two days, and you can't wait to come chasing after me.""
He smirked. ""Here's the deal. Apologize to Rose for what happened the other day, and I'll remarry you.""
I sucked in a sharp breath, my nails digging into my palms. ""I didn't do anything wrong, so I'm not apologizing. And for the record, I'm already married. I'm never going back to you.""
The one who should be apologizing was Rosalie.
And now that she was back, I'd make sure she paid for everything she'd done.
I tried to shove Leonardo aside, but his hands clamped hard on my shoulders.
His face darkened. ""What do you mean by married? You married another man? Letting Bella call a stranger dad?""
Before I could even answer, Rosalie's voice cut through, laced with mockery. ""Leo, didn't you say she and Bella were waiting for you to come home? And now she's out here claiming she's remarried?""
Leonardo froze, then exhaled heavily. ""Juliette, I know you're upset, but don't joke about something like that.""
Rosalie's gaze slid to the urn in my hands, her lips curling.
""I don't know if she's really remarried, but I'd bet anything she's about to tell you those ashes are Bella's—just to make you dump me.""
Leonardo's eyes snapped to the urn, fury sparking.
Instinctively, I held it tighter and stepped back.
I hadn't even said a word, but somehow, I'd already angered him.
""You're seriously trying to trick me with a box of ashes? How dare you curse Bella?""
His rage was blistering, and before I could stop myself, I blurted, ""I'm not lying! This really is Bella!""
But I didn't even get the words out before he ripped the urn from my arms and hurled it to the ground.
""No!""
The urn shattered, the ashes scattering with the wind. My heart twisted painfully in my chest.
""Leonardo, that's Bella! How could you? How could you do this to her?""
I frantically tried to gather the ashes with trembling hands, shielding what was left with my body.
But Leonardo kicked me aside.
""Juliette, you've really disappointed me,"" he said coldly.
""All this because I lost one little bet to Rose? You curse Bella and try to guilt me into coming back?""
Hearing him pretend to care about our daughter made me laugh through my tears.
Lost once bet?
How dare he even say that?
From the day Bella was born until the day she died. Those three years, he lost to Rosalie over and over again.
The first time, Rosalie threw my one-month-old baby into a bucket of water. Bella almost drowned.
The second time, she locked me in a sauna and nearly cooked me alive.
There were countless others I can't even bring myself to remember. But the last one... the last one cost Bella her life.
I still remember clutching Bella's tiny, burning body and begging Leonardo to take her to the hospital.
Rosalie just sneered, ""It was only laxatives. Does she really need to make such a scene?""
Leonardo hesitated for a moment, turned his back on us, and left with her.
Now, seeing me laugh like a lunatic, he looked stunned. He started toward me, but Rosalie shoved him back.
""The moment she cries, you're ready to believe her. You're so damn easy to fool.""
Then, without a shred of hesitation, she stepped on Bella's ashes.
Something inside me snapped. I lunged and shoved her away.
I hadn't even pushed hard, but she fell, hitting her head on the pavement.

1p3p5wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1p3p5wp/this_is_how_you_end_pain/,This is how you end pain,"My husband never left me.

His body might lie in the ground, but every culture in the history of our species has sought the ephemeral piece of each person that remains unclutchable. If a spirit is nothing more than a whisper in the dark, then it lives on through the impression it left on the one who took time to listen.

I don’t feel the touch of Henry’s hand on mine anymore; but the first sip of coffee, which he taught me to drink black, is and ongoing physical sensation that exists because of him. I made him a reader of Poe, and he would evermore look up and tell me that the moon never beams without bringing him dreams of his darling, his life, his bride. 

For the rest of my life, I will look into the night sky and feel him staring back. If that’s not immortality, I don’t know what is.

But I think I’ve taken too much. Every culture believed in the spirit because there’s something beyond the veil; everyone feels it, but no one knows it. Henry’s essence communes with me through anger when I laugh, noise when the 112-year-old house should be quiet, a feeling of being watched at every intimate moment. 

Everyone who laughs at the idea of being haunted by a ghost will turn around and confess to being haunted by a memory. Their superstition is that they believe these to be disparate notions.

Henry is alive, but he has no body. So he lives in me; I’m possessed, and it’s unnatural. When I stare at the mirror, it’s not my eyes looking back.

I’m aware how unnatural it is. But it’s just so *painful* to accept how memory associations fade. The smell of fresh-cut grass doesn’t bring me back to Henry’s Saturday morning routine the way it once did. Neuron by neuron, molecule by molecule, the ghosts get weaker. It’s like watching him die a second time. I wish that I’d stopped to consider how each birthday, every chore, any given kiss, and hell – even every fight, not matter how painful at the time, could be the last. Because there *will* be a last for all of us, and very few will see that coming. 

So I held onto his ghost.

I knew that things had reached a breaking point when I woke up with bite marks in places my mouth cannot reach. Biting used to be Henry’s intimate game – but he had always stopped before things went too far. So the current bruising and bleeding tell me that a line has been crossed. 

It’s time to let my husband go. 

So I dug his bones out of the flower garden and burned them in the woods under a full moon. It’s a shame, really, because the decomposition juices were *really* making the azaleas pop with color (this is why you dismember before you plop). Then I threw his severed penis, which I’d been fucking nightly, into the garbage grinder.

Sleek, sophisticated, and effortlessly cool, this subtle twist on a classic tee opens the door to endless styling possibilities—whether you're going for casual comfort or sharp minimalism. Let’s dive into how you can rock a high-neck tee with confidence and ease.

# 1. Keep It Simple and Sleek

One of the best ways to style a high-neck t-shirt is to embrace its minimalist nature. Pair a solid-colored high-neck tee with slim-fit jeans or chinos. Neutral shades like black, white, grey, or beige work well and give off that clean, put-together look. Add a pair of crisp sneakers or loafers, and you’ve nailed a sharp everyday outfit.

# 2. Layer Up Smartly

The high neckline adds a refined edge, making it a perfect layering piece. Throw on a lightweight bomber jacket, denim jacket, or even a structured blazer over your tee for a smart-casual look. This approach gives off an effortlessly polished vibe, ideal for dinner dates, semi-formal events, or a creative office environment.

# 3. Dress It Up

Believe it or not, high-neck tees can be dressed up. Tuck one into tailored trousers and finish the look with a belt and dress shoes. It’s a fantastic alternative to a button-down when you want a contemporary, fashion-forward touch without sacrificing elegance. Bonus tip: a monochromatic outfit using varying textures can really make the look pop.

# 4. Street Style Ready

For a more relaxed, trend-savvy approach, combine your high-neck tee with joggers, cargo pants, or wide-leg trousers. Top it off with a casual overshirt, bucket hat, or crossbody bag. This vibe is perfect for weekend hangs, coffee runs, or hitting up your favorite spots in the city.

# 5. Experiment with Layers and Accessories

Don’t be afraid to accessorize. Neck chains worn over the collar, stylish watches, or sunglasses can elevate your outfit instantly. You can even play with contrasts—mix your high-neck with a flannel shirt or a bold patterned overshirt for a fashion-forward edge.

In conclusion, a **high neck t-shirt** is more than just a fashion piece—it's a style statement. With the right pairing, it can transform your entire look, offering both comfort and sophistication in one simple garment. Whether you're layering it or letting it stand alone, it’s a staple every modern man should have in his wardrobe.",1,1763803843.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

1p3p1st,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3p1st,The Sandwich hangover of colonial Bombay (pre 1995),"Most Mumbai bakeries trace back to the colonial era when the British needed European bread and Goans, who’d learned baking under Portuguese rule, saw opportunity. The 1900s to 1920s saw a flood of these bakeries. They thrived because the city needed cheap, consistent, quality bread for working-class neighbourhoods. They also served up their signature sandwiches, baked puffs, quiches and pattices, khari and other classic biscuits, and simple cakes, the names usually scrawled on the counter in red or black marker.

One thing that’s distinct about these sandwiches is that they come wrapped in cellophane, a quick grab-and-go deal that sets them apart from the made-to-order ones you get at cafés nowadays. This post is about my thing for those cellophane-wrapped sandwiches, which is pretty different from the iconic Bombay sandwich but still sits firmly within Mumbai’s sandwich culture.

Growing up in the 90s in a convent school, having these sandwiches was something to look forward to. You would find them outside most churches, the perfect quick fix for the pious and the hungry. The chicken mayo sandwich may look humble and easy to make, but it takes some real skill. You need just the right balance of mayo to chicken and you have to spread the mix thick, not so it gets soggy, not so it feels dry. I could go on about my obsession with the chicken sandwich, but let’s get to the point: where do you actually get the best?

**Fresco Bakery, Juhu (Top Tier):** I found this place way too late in life but it’s become my go-to spot. The breads are soft, the chicken mayo sandwich has never tasted like it’s been sitting in syrup, and the mutton pattice, chicken salami, and chutney cheese sandwiches are all spot on. This is what a Bombay deli sandwich should be: fresh bread, real filling, nothing extra.

**American Express (Multiple Locations):** Most people know American Express because of the Salman Khan hit-and-run outside Bandra in 2002. Five people died. My real connection is from much before when my father would repair their ovens at the Clare Road factory in Byculla, so I grew up eating AE bread and eventually ended up on their deli menu. Their ham and cheese sandwich, salami sandwich, and mutton roast are always solid. But the cheese celery roll is my personal favourite. Back in college, it was the cheapest thing on the menu, so I got it by default. Turns out I actually really liked it. Their Hungarian coffee cake is pretty good too.

**J. Hearsch & Co., Bandra:**  
Hearsch is good, no doubt, but honestly it’s overhyped. I’ve never understood standing in a queue for a sandwich.

**The Bakery Outside Gloria Church:**  
This one didn’t have a name. That’s where it started for me after school - small, nothing fancy, just a counter. But the chicken mayo sandwich, Manchurian roll, and chocolate ball are my childhood. I can’t say if it was the best, but it’s what got me hooked.

**Parsi Amelioration Committee (PAC):**  
Not your usual Goan bakery. But it’s genuinely hidden. Their brain cutlets are insane. They mix it with sandwiches and some proper Parsi snacks, which is the whole point.

When these bakeries opened, they weren’t Indian or European just something uniquely Bombay (pre 1995). Portuguese Goans, British colonisers, Parsi families, and muslim bakers all did their bit to build a food ecosystem that has survived independence, riots, liberalization, and everything since.

These bakeries and their sandwiches are a piece of Mumbai's food culture that’s quietly fading out while NYC-style sandwich shops and sourdough bakeries take over Instagram. Deli joints like these are turning into relics.

The question isn’t if they’ll survive. Some will. It’s whether they can stay true—cheap, consistent, no frills while the world pushes everything toward premium packaging and artisanal brands.

It’s his first time in Central America, and I think one of his American friends helped suggest the destinations. I’m a little worried the places we picked might feel too gentrified or touristy, and that we might be missing some of the more authentic parts of the country.

For context, I’m from Panama and I love the Caribbean vibe (Bocas del Toro especially). I’m not a huge fan of super Americanized beach towns, so I want to make sure we’re getting a mix of nature, culture, beaches, and the real CR experience.

Here’s our current itinerary:
Dec 6: Arrive Liberia, stay in playa hermosa
Dec 7–9: Playa Hermosa (2 days of diving)
Dec 9–12: Manuel Antonio (park, beach, Nauyaca waterfall, ziplining)
Dec 12–16: La Fortuna (horseback, hot springs, coffee tour)
Dec 16–20: Santa Teresa area (Tortuga Island, beaches)


My questions:
1. Are we spending too long in any of these places (La Fortuna/Manuel Antonio)?
2. Is Monteverde worth cutting a day or two for?
3. Or should we skip Santa Teresa and go to the Caribbean side (Puerto Viejo / Cahuita) instead for a more cultural, less Americanized vibe?

If we want something that feels more like Bocas del Toro or more authentically Central American, what would you recommend?

The cover itself is like a psychedelic hidden object picture: intricate reflections, the band in a casual 60s aesthetic, plus that wonderfully matt, slightly yellowed look of the old pressing. You immediately notice that this record already contains half a century of stories.

Ummagumma was released in 1969, right at the point where the band began to break away from the Syd Barrett era and build their own experimental cosmos. One side live recordings full of wild improvisations, the other four solo mini-albums from each member - completely crazy, completely uncommercial, completely Pink Floyd. For many it is a transitional work, for others an underrated gem... I love this strange, untamed energy.

The fact that this is the first German edition makes the whole thing even more special for me. These slightly worn corners, the paper that is no longer completely white - it is precisely this “patina charm” that makes it so attractive. It feels like you're holding a piece of music history right in your hands.

The live page is currently running and I'm sitting next to it with coffee. A Saturday couldn't start better. ☕️✨

I remembered she mentioned early on that she loved scavenger hunts as a kid, so I decided to create one around our city. I spent a few days mapping out locations that meant something to us: the coffee shop where we had our first date, the park where we had our first kiss, the bookstore where we spent three hours browsing together.

For each location, I wrote a clue that would lead her to the next spot. Some were riddles, some were inside jokes, and one was even a terrible poem (she roasted me for that one, deservedly). At each location, there was a small surprise waiting - her favorite candy bar, a Polaroid from that day, a handwritten note.

The best part? Watching her face light up when she realized where each clue was leading. We ended up retracing our entire relationship, and it felt like experiencing all those moments again for the first time. The final clue led her to the place where we first met, where I had a picnic set up.

Total cost: Maybe $40 for the picnic supplies and little surprises. Time invested: A few hours of planning. Her reaction: Priceless.

If you're looking for a date idea that's personal, memorable, and doesn't break the bank, I can't recommend this enough. It showed her I paid attention to the little things and remembered our story together. Plus, it got us out exploring the city instead of just sitting somewhere staring at our phones.

As someone who has explored various weight management products, Java Burn stands out as a revolutionary solution. This review sheds light on my personal experience with Java Burn, a product that has redefined my approach to weight loss.

\*\*Effective Weight Management: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn's primary claim is to enhance weight loss, and it delivers on this promise with impressive results. After incorporating it into my daily routine, I experienced a noticeable increase in my metabolism. This translated into more effective fat burning, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. The pounds started melting away, and I felt more energetic throughout the day.

&#x200B;

\*\*Sustained Energy: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

One of the most remarkable aspects of Java Burn is its ability to provide sustained energy without the typical jitters associated with some weight loss supplements. Instead of experiencing crashes, I felt a steady and consistent stream of energy, which was instrumental in maintaining an active lifestyle. It helped me power through workouts and stay alert throughout my day, making it easier to make healthier choices.

&#x200B;

\*\*Enhanced Mental Clarity: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn doesn't just target physical weight loss; it also supports mental clarity and focus. The blend of natural ingredients, including nootropics, contributed to improved cognitive function. This mental boost helped me stay on track with my weight loss goals by reducing cravings and emotional eating.

&#x200B;

\*\*Natural Ingredients: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn's use of natural ingredients is commendable. It contains a blend of powerful compounds like green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and more, which are backed by scientific research for their weight management benefits. Knowing that I was consuming a product with safe and natural ingredients gave me confidence in its effectiveness and safety.

I'm a little hesitant to post here but I think it is the case with all of the students. I'm also a student , in my 3rd years and I have to travel a lot because of studies and I also love travelling. But every time I find myself searching on Google 'is this place safe to go' and I end up with generic reviews and years old threads. There is not a single method to know is place is actually safe and should I visit. This is the case with almost all students who leave their home town for studies.

I remember during my first year I skipped plans because most of my friends were day scholars and I don't want to come back my pg alone . I was so literally so frustrated and have to come back to my pg before 7 most of the times. Every time I want to explore somewhere new or plan a trip, it's the same anxiety: checking five different sources, asking random people, still not knowing for sure. I don't have a big friend group just me and my 2 friends and that's why it still a problem for us!

The cost of batteries and materials to upgrade are too expensive it needs to be toned down, because I ran out so quick not being able to max them in one go. 

How do you guys farm your materials? For me what I do is I stack the battery number each day until the number reaches 500 or 700 each week by logging in everyday to get coffee. Then by weekend I start farming and upgrading, building the character where I play most of my free time. The back up battery storage recharges full like once a month (I think) if I don't use it. So it takes a while for it to be used 2400 fully charged. Without using the battery storage or a consumable, let's say I have 500 batteries saved up, it is not enough required materials needed because the material cost is expensive when used. So I have use to 100 battery consumption each battle until I eventually run out. Which forced me to wait again or use the battery storage or consumable until I run out. Even if playing the events, it is not enough what they give for rewards of agent level up materials, I'd still be a hundred short. Because of this it's like I'm obligated to buy the pass every new version just so I could have a boost. 

I repeat the same routine by stacking the battery during weekdays and play it on weekend to farm the materials, which is still not enough to max everything all in one go like the engine and the talents. It takes like 3 weeks or a month straight to build one character to max. Other hoyo games I have no issues on farming materials which is a breeze and easy to max characters no problem in a single week or two. But Zenless alone is time consuming the most it takes a whole month. Been playing since launch I still find difficult it becomes a routine. The materials required are just too expensive when used.

In October we welcomed our baby girl at 35 weeks after a risky pregnancy where my c-section from the previous birth was starting to fail from within my womb because of the growing baby and kicking. It was a burning sensation, lots of pain and muscle spasms if anyone is curious about the signs. Also preterm labor, contractions started from 27 weeks and became more regular as weeks went by, I would get a series of mild to serious contractions every few hours. I was in and out of hospital being monitored by my OB and maternity nurses for a few weeks.

Anyway, we had to bring our little one into the world early and I held on until 35 weeks in hopes of the best outcome. Baby was born at 1.98kg. She was fine on room air. She needed an NG tube as she was not feeding well and then lost weight after birth to 1.83kg so we had to wait for her to pick up again. It was an extremely emotional 2 weeks for me with ups and downs. I was able to board at the hospital and be there with my baby and handle as much of her care as possible while also trying to rest in between. 

There was one nurse who was determined to help my baby take her bottles and send us home, she helped me try different feeding positions and bottles until we found exactly what worked best for my baby, and within 3 days of her help my baby was able to start finishing her required bottles, lose the ng tube and pick up weight faster. Then I had my first night with my baby allowed to sleep next to me in her cot in the boarding mother's room, and then 1 more night to be sure my baby was okay out of the nicu ward, and we were able to go home the next morning. I will forever be so grateful for that nurse's determination and her confidence in me and my baby. 

I credit my remaining sanity to the nicu nurses being there to ease me into the newborn phase again, the speech therapist who I actually started looking forward to her rounds so we could chat while she checked on all her babies, and the hospital coffee shop. (Also my husband for handling absolutely everything else including home school with our older son). 

I did not leave the hospital for 19 days in total pre and post birth/nicu stay. It was not what I expected but it was what had to happen. I think I'm still on auto-pilot and will only come to terms with the immense anxiety, emotions and trauma I experienced again, much later on. 

I wanted to share my story as I often see parents asking about 34 and 35 week babies and their possible outcomes. Please bare in mind I think we had the least complicated situation. 

My previous baby was born at 33 weeks last year and unable to breathe on his own, he went from nasal cannula to cpap to the ventilator and passed away shortly after lung collapse, emergency surgery and then sepsis. He had a lifetime of 5 days only. There was so much I was still trying to learn and understand in those few days before he was taken from us. I wish I knew then what I know now, I wish I had the confidence I have now. Since his passing, I spent a lot of my free time reading about nicu babies, their conditions and how to give them the best outcomes. 

Some little things I did differently when preparing for our baby, I bought her a little octopal to hold in her incubator because it mimics the comfort of holding the umbilical cord and is also something safe for babies to handle instead of pulling the monitor wires or ng tube. I also bought her a little lamaze sammy star to look at for visual stimulation since it's small enough to not get in the way in her incubator cot. I also bought little velcro vests online that could go around the monitor wires so I could still 'dress' her up and have that connection. I bought a premie sized pacifier which thanfully we didn't need, she was able to use the normal newborn avent soothie. Lastly, I brushed her hair. I will always regret not brushing my angel baby's hair when he was alive. 

I also bought a snuza pico monitor for going home, instead of an owlet.

To parents, be confident, you can do hard things. Don't forget to take care of yourself. It's okay to take a break, it's okay to rest, it's okay to have a huge slice of comfort chocolate cake, it's okay to cry, it's okay to ask for help. 

I wish each of you and your babies the best. ",1,1763801160.0,NICUParents,1,1.0,False

Arabica coffee usually has less caffeine and a mild acidity. Many specialty coffee shops prefer Arabica for its delicate flavors.

# Robusta Beans

Robusta beans grow at lower altitudes and warmer climates. They have a stronger, harsher flavor than Arabica. Robusta coffee contains more caffeine and a bold, bitter taste. These beans are often used in espresso blends to add body and crema. They are also cheaper to produce and more resistant to pests.

# Specialty Beans

Specialty beans come from unique farms with careful cultivation. These beans score high in quality and flavor tests. They offer distinct tastes depending on the region and processing method. Specialty coffee often has bright acidity and complex flavors. Coffee drinkers seek these beans for a premium experience.

# Leading Coffee Bean Origins

The best coffee beans come from specific regions known for ideal growing conditions. These places produce unique flavors and aromas. Understanding these origins helps you appreciate your cup more.

Different countries have distinct climates and soils that affect coffee taste. The leading origins include Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil, and Kenya. Each offers something special to coffee lovers worldwide.

# Ethiopian Beans

Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee. Its beans are known for fruity and floral notes. Ethiopian coffee often has bright acidity and a complex flavor profile. Many are grown in wild or semi-wild conditions, which adds to their uniqueness.

# Colombian Beans

Colombia produces smooth and balanced coffee beans. These beans have a mild acidity with nutty and caramel flavors. The country’s mountainous terrain provides excellent growing conditions. Colombian coffee is popular for its consistent quality.

# Brazilian Beans

Brazil is the largest coffee producer in the world. Brazilian beans are usually nutty, chocolatey, and low in acidity. They are often used in espresso blends for their rich body. The country’s vast farms help supply coffee globally.

# Kenyan Beans

Kenyan coffee beans stand out for their bright acidity and fruity taste. They often carry berry and citrus flavors with a wine-like finish. The high altitude and volcanic soil contribute to their distinct quality. Kenyan coffee is highly prized by enthusiasts.

# Factors Affecting Coffee Quality

Quality coffee starts long before brewing. Several factors shape the taste and aroma of coffee beans. These factors influence the beans’ characteristics, from growth to processing. Understanding these helps to appreciate why some coffee beans stand out worldwide.

# Altitude And Climate

Coffee plants grow best in specific altitudes. Higher altitudes mean cooler temperatures and slower bean development. This slow growth helps beans develop complex flavors. Climate plays a big role too. Stable temperatures and regular rainfall make a perfect environment. Too much heat or rain can hurt the bean quality.

# Harvesting Methods

The way farmers pick coffee cherries affects quality. Hand-picking allows selecting only ripe cherries. This method ensures better taste and fewer defects. Mechanical harvesting is faster but less selective. It can mix unripe and overripe cherries. Careful harvesting protects the beans’ flavor and freshness.

# Processing Techniques

After harvesting, beans undergo processing to remove the fruit. The main methods are washed, natural, and honey processes. Washed processing uses water to clean beans, creating a bright flavor. Natural processing dries the whole cherry, giving fruity and sweet notes. Honey processing is between the two, balancing sweetness and acidity. Each method changes the final taste of coffee.

# Top Brands And Their Best Beans

Top coffee brands have crafted unique blends cherished worldwide. Their beans offer distinct flavors and aromas. These brands maintain high standards for quality and consistency. Here is a look at some top brands and their best coffee beans.

# Lavazza

Lavazza is a renowned Italian brand with a long tradition. Their Super Crema blend is famous for smoothness and rich aroma. It combines Arabica and Robusta beans. This blend delivers a creamy texture and balanced taste. Lavazza beans suit espresso lovers who prefer mild bitterness.

# Price And Value Comparison

Choosing the best coffee beans involves balancing price and value. Coffee lovers want great taste without overspending. This section compares different beans by cost and flavor. It helps find options that suit various budgets and preferences.

# Affordable Options

Affordable coffee beans offer good flavor for everyday use. Brands like Lavazza and Black Rifle provide quality at lower prices. These beans suit people who enjoy coffee without high costs. You can find them in many stores and online.

# Premium And Rare Beans

Premium beans come from special regions and rare plants. Examples include Black Ivory and Stumptown’s rare blends. These beans cost more due to their unique taste and limited supply. They appeal to coffee enthusiasts who want exclusive flavors.

# Cost Vs. Flavor

Price does not always mean better taste. Some affordable beans deliver rich, smooth flavors. Expensive beans can offer complex notes but may not suit all palates. Test different beans to find the best match for your budget and taste.

# Brewing Tips For Best Flavor

Brewing coffee is an art. Using the best beans needs careful brewing. Small details make a big difference in taste. Follow these simple tips to bring out rich flavor from your coffee beans.

# Grinding Techniques

Grind size affects flavor and extraction time. Use coarse grind for French press and fine grind for espresso. Grind beans just before brewing to keep freshness. Avoid pre-ground coffee to prevent loss of aroma.

# Water Temperature

Water temperature impacts the taste greatly. Ideal temperature is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C). Water too hot burns coffee; too cold under-extracts. Use a thermometer or kettle with temperature control for best results.

# Brewing Methods

Different methods highlight unique flavors. Drip coffee makers offer smooth taste. French press gives full-bodied and rich flavor. Espresso machines create strong, concentrated coffee. Choose a method that suits your taste and grind size.

# Sourcing Ethical Coffee Beans

Choosing the best coffee beans involves more than taste. Ethical sourcing plays a big role in quality and impact. Ethical coffee beans come from farms that care about people and the planet. These beans support fair wages and protect the environment. They help build stronger farming communities. Learning how coffee beans are sourced helps you make better choices.

# Fair Trade Certifications

Fair Trade certification ensures farmers get fair pay for their work. It stops exploitation and promotes safe working conditions. Coffee with this label supports small farmers and their families. It also encourages transparent trade practices. Choosing fair trade coffee helps reduce poverty in coffee-growing regions.

# Sustainable Farming

Sustainable farming protects soil, water, and wildlife. It uses natural methods instead of harmful chemicals. This keeps the land healthy for future crops. Shade-grown coffee is one example that preserves forests. Sustainable farms reduce carbon footprints and fight climate change. Buying these beans supports eco-friendly farming practices.

# Impact On Communities

Ethical coffee farming improves local communities. It funds schools, healthcare, and clean water projects. It creates stable jobs and better living conditions. Women and children gain access to education and safety. Coffee farmers can plan for the future with confidence. Your coffee choice can bring real change to these areas.

These are not my plants--they caught my eye at the coffee shop where I often go.  It's that time of year when the weather goes from bearable to freezing, and all the folks around here start moving their container plants inside or closer to it.  The Polly caught my eye so I took all the pictures.  Most of these plants don't live here most of the year, though I'm not sure where they do.  Most of the shops in town look a bit like this, plants just inside windows soaking up the sun without getting too cold.  
Nights will get down to freezing probably end of next week, and days will get that low early January.  Homes and shops will be crowded with plants.  <3 ",2,1763800627.0,houseplants,0,1.0,False

Now for the first time I'm not at a relatives home or a hotel, and since I'm a shorts/flip-flops person, this 1st winter is kicking my behind.

I got a couple of space heaters but they seem to be just enough for the bathroom.  The place I rented has these built in metal coils don't know the name but they are connected to the water heater and have a thermostat in the hallway that seem to control it.  Now maybe I'm using the wrong keywords when searching YouTube but I just don't quite get the procedure. Do you set it to the temperature you want and leave it on until May?  am I going to have an aneurism when the first gas bill shows up?  Already had a minor one when the summer electric bill showed up after using these individual AC units from the turn of the century.

As I write this laying on a sofa having coffee,  I see my outside thermometer shows 8 C brrrrrrr even my drinks are warmer than that... Inside is 19 C and I'm wearing flannel plus a blanket folded in half to be double layer. Farther inside the apt is 20-21, the glass doors to the terrace have less insulation than the backyard open tiki back home so it is a challenge to keep the house at one temp.  

I've been putting the thermostat to 22 during the day to warm up the house and then 21 at night, (don't have heat in the room so why bother). hoping to wait for the 1st bill to see how it goes, but I'm still mostly cold 24/7, it doesn't help that whoever design the apt. must've been drunk or failed all the design classes, the kitchen has a window but no heater element or AC unit, so that affects the whole apt in a bad way. Then the main bedroom has AC next to the sliding doors to the terrace but no heat, truly don't understand just trying to be one with the Spanish ways.

So how do you set up things for the cold? I figure it's gonna get worse and I won't  become one of those snowbirds that flocks to S.Florida, somehow I need to tackle this winter thing.

So basically, two years ago I (23 F at the time, 25 now) met this guy (23 M at the time, 25 now) and we went out two or three times. At that time I was just coming out of an incredibly abusive relationship. After our few dates he became very attached (when I broke it off he made a comment about how hearing that from the ‘person he thought he would spend his life with’ was really hard.” I was not ready at the time to be in a relationship and honestly overall was just not really attracted to him and didn’t feel a connection. So I told him I wasn’t ready to be in a relationship and we went our separate ways. Well, he happened to reach out randomly the other day and I happened to have been getting home from a night out (with a few drinks) when he called. I answered and we talked for a bit and made plans to get lunch. After a few drinks I was not thinking of the implications of making a plan like this. He has always been very sweet and even ordered coffee and breakfast to be delivered to me the next morning (I did not ask him to do this and actually told him he doesn’t have to do that and it’s not necessary but he did it anyways.) So now I am unsure how I should proceed. I am still not interested in him romantically as the connection was just never there for me but he has had feelings for me all this time and I agreed to this lunch date when I was not in my right mind. After thinking about it the next morning I realized that agreeing to this plan probably sent the wrong message. Now I do not know how to break it to him that I am not interested romantically and that I don’t think we should continue with our lunch plan. When I expressed I wasn’t interested the last time I blamed the circumstances of my abusive relationship rather than highlighting how I felt about the whole situation. Now I feel like I need to express that I don’t think we are compatible in that sense in order to be completely clear, but that is hard for me as I am a people pleaser and I have a really hard time hurting peoples feelings.

1p3o3wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1p3o3wr/dexamphetamine_different_effects/,Dexamphetamine - Different Effects?,"Hello all 


>**CONTEXT**

I (25M) was recently (~2 months ago) prescribed dex and have had varying effects and just wanted to see if anyone’s had similar experiences. 


First of all, I think it’s overall worked a charm. I am way more productive, most importantly in ‘life admin’ stuff that I would continually put off. There’s absolutely still a ways to go but the medication has really helped take those first steps. 


I have previously been on basically every antidepressant under the sun to little avail - the one that did work for a year or so also had awful side effects and after having increasing amounts of panic attacks I got off it. 


I was prescribed the 5mg dex tablets - originally 15mg a day which i took at around 8, 11-12 and 3 (if needed), but revisited with my psych and upped it to 6 (30mg). This has mostly been where i’ve seen effects, and is now my usual dose. I try to have at least one day off a week - usually my busiest/‘deadline’ day at work where I would NEED to have stuff done and managed to do so pre-medication and/or on a Sunday if I don’t have a lot to do that day. 


I have also had full blood work, blood pressure and ECG testing which has all shown no issues. 


>**ACTUAL QUESTION**

So, has anyone experienced completely varying degrees with their dex? Most days I will take the full 30mg and won’t ‘notice’ i’m on it (in a good way). This is in contrast with other days where I will take it - and while it still works as well - feel like i’ve just railed 3 lines of coke. Other days, i’ll take the same dosage and feel like my old unproductive self and not get anything done. I’d say it’s a 80/10/10 split respectively.  


I understand that food and tolerance play a big part, but i’ve monitored both and these times don’t feel like they have any connection (not occurring the day after i’ve taken a day off taking it or on an empty stomach etc). The only time I could point to was when I also had an energy drink (I used to have at least 2, usually 3 500ml white monsters per day), but I (loosely) cut out caffeine pretty easily since and still noticed it occurred at times. The few times i’ve had a coffee or energy drink since it also hasn’t had that effect. 


I’m mainly wondering if this is a common thing, or if maybe this medication isn’t right for me. I have pretty bad anxiety and these times where I can feel the dex ‘high’ out of nowhere on my regular dose just kind of spirals me into worrying about my heart rate, health etc. 


I’m seeing my psych again next week, and plan on discussing moving to a long acting medication, or just switching from dex, even though I do like how well it’s working currently. 


Any help/advice/experience is welcomed and greatly appreciated. ",3,1763799894.0,ausadhd,3,1.0,False

I used to have a steady job, a small emergency fund, and I felt like I had things mostly under control. Then last year, the company I worked for shut down our entire department with barely two weeks’ notice. I figured I’d find another job quickly, but the market has been a lot tougher than I expected.

It wasn’t just the job loss itself that hit hard, but how quickly my savings disappeared once EI ran out. Grocery shopping, something I never thought twice about, now comes with mental calculations about what I can stretch and what has to wait. I even stopped buying small things like take-out coffee, and now I just make the cheapest coffee at home and still feel a bit guilty for the cost.

I’m on social assistance now, which is something I never imagined I would need. The staff were polite and helpful, but I still walked home feeling embarrassed and defeated, like I had missed some milestone everyone else managed to reach. I keep reminding myself these programs exist for people who need them, but it’s hard not to feel the weight of it every time I tap my transit card and hope I still have enough balance.

I’m applying for jobs constantly. Some days I feel hopeful when new listings appear, and other days it feels like every application just disappears into a void. I’m trying to stay positive, but it’s exhausting pretending everything is fine when I’m counting coins for fare or groceries.

I’m sharing this here because I know a lot of people in Canada are dealing with similar situations right now. I’m not looking for magic advice or motivational speeches just maybe some perspective from others who’ve been here and managed to get through it. It helps to know I’m not the only one trying to hold things together one day at a time.",9,1763799718.0,povertyfinancecanada,3,1.0,False

If you’re someone who enjoys calm company, meaningful talk, and a comfortable atmosphere, feel free to reach out.
Let’s see where a conversation takes us a friendship, a connection, or just a pleasant evening.

Thanks for reading.

1p3nyk3,https://i.redd.it/1xgxqyymer2g1.png,Totally Joshculous Episode 8,"With yet another double elimination on the horizon, Jose takes to attempting to seduce Axel to sway her to his side as he did with the twins in the previous episode, however she refuses his advances and outright tells him she doesn't trust him. Jose warns Axel that she can't survive this game alone, but she waves him off, she considers him a worthy teammate but she has enough friends. In the boys cabin, the rest of the Killer Bass boys discuss who their team could do without, considering the failures of everyone evenly. Topher calls them insane for expecting him to get his hair chopped off with a chainsaw and shifts the blame to Zee for not being able to go a single day without drinking soda. Damien calls Topher a jerk for targeting Zee when he just lost his best friend. The hockey bros agree that Topher hasn't really brought anything to the table aside from being rude, and with the tides shifting against him this close to elimination it seems too late for the preppy boy to save himself.

As the Killer Bass file in for elimination, Blaineley once again warns them that with the numbers thinning out no one has a place to hide and you'll have to earn your spot if you want to stay in the competition. Josh gives marshmallows to Jose, Damien, Wayne & Raj, Max & Scarlett, Amy & Samey. Axel, Lauren, Topher, and Zee remain endangered as only two marshmallows remain on the plate. The survivalist shares an uneasy look with her spooky friend as the odds of them both making it out of this seem slim. Topher glares at Zee who's absentmindedly chugging a soda. The final marshmallows go to...Axel and Zee.

Josh teases the drama club member on his way out for using up his 15 minutes of fame and says he hopes his time in the spotlight was worth it because it's all downhill from here, kid. Jose comments on how Zee was a hair from elimination. Damien chimes in that's because Topher got himself into a hairy situation. Max says he bald hard but it's over now. The boys laugh at Topher until Axel finally demands they zip it. Lauren says it looks like rain. (Good thing she brought an umbrella.) In doing so she leaves the game.

\---> Jose: Axel told me she has enough friends already, and it didn't take long for me to figure out who she meant. Certainly not going to miss that *psicópata,* and with her gone Axel will find herself with no choice but to find safety in my Latin warmth.

\---> Scarlett: Something tells me I'm not the only power player on this team. It's time the real mastermind finally put her sidekick to work. (adjusts her glasses)

The next morning, the hosts waste no time in gathering the remaining twenty-three campers for today's challenge: canoeing to the haunted Boney Island, starting a bonfire, and making it back! Blaineley explicitly warns the contestants *not* to take anything from the island, though Josh cuts her off and says if they did, it would be great for ratings. Blaineley leaves to find a bathroom after having her morning coffee as the teens take off, aside from one farmboy who shows up late. Josh doesn't bother warning him as he runs off to join the others.

Leshaniqua and Jasmine partner up for the canoe challenge, the Australian asking her teammate for advice on if she should pursue a relationship with Shawn, or stay mad at him for leaving her buried alive. Leshaniqua tells her that if Shawn really likes her he'll do something to show it. Sky travels with Ella, the princess admitting to her crush on Dave, though she's noticed he seems more interested in Sky and doesn't wish to intrude on true love. Sky laughs and says that yeah Dave's cute but he's not all that and Ella can totally go for him if she wants. In another canoe Dave asks Ripper for advice on when he should ask Sky out, who offers him solid advice on being confident and asking about what she likes. Dave says that Ripper is actually kinda cool sometimes, inadvertedly causing the bully to take offense and fart on him. Emma travels with Chase and tries to share a romantic moment with him, however he's too self-absorbed in posing for the cameras and trying to make their canoe go really fast, causing the blonde to start to feel ignored in their relationship. Shawn and Priya are an unstoppable dream team and are the first to arrive to Boney Island due to their athleticism and coordination. Julia chooses to travel with Bowie to attempt to sweet talk him onto her side, however he brings Rodney with them to act a communication barrier as he asks stupid questions like ""what's an alliance?"" whenever the purple-eyed girl tries talking strategy. Bowie confesses that he knows what Julia is trying to do and that Mother Theresa act may be working on the others but he sees right through it.

Jose and Amy pair on the Bass, the hunk further taking the narcissistic bimbo under his wing by paying her compliments every few moments. Wayne & Raj pair up, the inseparable duo that they are, and are the first from their team to each Boney Island. Max asks Scarlett if she will be his travel partner, however she advises that they split up for the day to expand their influence into the boy's alliance. The purple gnome instead travels with Damien, who considers him a little strange but has no reason to turn down the alliance offer as a rookie player. Scarlett meanwhile travels with Zee, attempting to coax him to coming to her side. Zee agrees and confesses he wishes he could bring all his friends together, suddenly coming up with the genius idea for a super alliance! Axel travels with Samey, the two forming a slight bond as the tomboy comments on how the cheerleader has been quiet lately and seems like she could use a friend. Samey appreciates having someone to open up to, and shares her stories of abuse from her sister. Before the blonde can mention she wants to make up, Axel promises to have a ""talk"" with Amy later that day.

Predictably, Rodney takes the cursed totem from Boney Island, seeing it as a cool souvenir to share with his folks back home. The curse takes hold as a rogue spark from the Gophers bonfire burns a hole through Shawn & Priya's canoe, going unnoticed by the duo until its much too late. As Jasmine finds herself worrying about Shawn's fate on the Wawanakwa shores, a hand shoots out of the water a la zombie flick as Shawn swims himself and an unconscious Priya to safety. The Australian hugs him, overjoyed the beanie boy made it out alright until she's cut off by a smug Josh who reminds her that their team lost today, and while they all might be alive \*for now\*, they still gotta vote someone off. Tonight.
