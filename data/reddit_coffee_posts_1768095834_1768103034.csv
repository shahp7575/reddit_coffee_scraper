That seems trivial, until you realize this same principle may decide the ultimate fate of the universe. Entropy doesn’t just affect breakfast. It governs stars burning out, energy becoming unusable, and the possibility of a future heat death where nothing interesting can happen anymore. If time only moves forward because entropy increases, does that mean the universe itself has a built in expiration date?

I’m a PhD student in physics, and I recently explored this idea starting from the simplest example imaginable: coffee.

I moved in about a month ago and its been difficult to say the least. Im ocd, I like things to be clean. Floors, surfaces, furniture, kitchen, no dishes in the sink, left over food in the fridge. Bathroom to be generally clean etc..
Since I moved in I noticed that they dont clean AT ALL. LIKE LITERALLY AT ALL. 
Lets start with the kitchen. They leave piles of dishes in the sink and it stacks up HIGH. To the point that nearly every dish in the house is dirty. They have approximately 50 pieces of silverware and will dirty every single one. Every cup. Every bowl. Every plate. They leave stuff all over the counter.. dirty dishes, left over food, coffee cups half food, coffee grounds in the maker, coffee in the jar. They leave stuff all over the kitchen table, same things as on the counter.. and will let the trash overflow before thinking about touching it. Lets move to the living room where three of the dogs are crated. Dirt and hair and dogfood all over the floor (sometimes when they feed the dogs and cant find a bowl.. THEY DUMP THE DOGFOOD ON THE FLOOR OF THE CRATE OR JUST ON THE FLOOR IN GENERAL TO FEED THEM). if the dogs piss or shit in the crate theyll leave it for days if i dont clean it up. They leave piles of shit and piss on the floor for weeks apparentlh because i had to scrape it off the floor when i moved in. They dont clean theor shoes or take them off in the house so theirs dirt and shit particles all over the floor. The dogs also shed alot of hair and they dont clean it so every single surface, nook or cranny in the home is covered in an unbelievably amount of dog hair and they dont care. It took me 3 hours to de-shed the couch of hair. Lets go to the bathroom. Dirty as hell. The roommate sticks her hair all over the inside of the shower. They never clean out the toiler bowl. They wear their dirty shoes in the bathroom without care and its just as disgusting as the rest of the house. Now my girlfriends bedroom. She takes the dogs out and doesnt care whats on their feet and lets them in the bed. One dog is a double coated golden retriever so it sheds what i believe is about its body weight in hair in the room and on the bed every day. Literally everything is covered in, and imbedded in hair.

Basically entropy increases until everything is cold and dead and time stops. It is bleak. But while researching for a video project recently I dove back into Roger Penrose’s Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) and I forgot how elegant it is.

The basic idea is that in the far far future, when all the stars are gone and even black holes have evaporated via Hawking Radiation, the universe will contain nothing but photons (light). Since photons have no mass, they technically do not experience time or distance.

So at that point, the ""scale"" of the universe becomes meaningless. An infinitely large universe looks mathematically identical to an infinitely small point. And that transition might be what triggers the next Big Bang. I just find it fascinating that the Heat Death might not be ""The End"" but actually just the necessary condition for the next universe to start.

We know the universe is dying (Heat Death). Entropy increases until everything fades away. But there is a theory by Roger Penrose called Cyclic Conformal Cosmology that suggests that once the universe is completely empty and ""dead,"" it effectively loses track of scale and time, which triggers a new Big Bang.

It basically implies that the universe goes through infinite cycles of death and rebirth. It forgets everything and starts over.

I made a breakdown of this on my channel Marsh Breaks It Down in a video called Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee. I mostly talk about the coffee mistake, but the end of the video gets into this idea that ""The End"" is actually just the start of the next cycle.

This is just my dump account. I (F25) and my boyfriend (M24) have been in a relationship for almost a year. The problem is, I don’t see a future with him anymore. Should I break up with him?

Context:
I have a stable job and earn a five digit monthly salary which is more than enough for me since I’m not the breadwinner of my family. However, I do have my own financial obligations right now, so I can’t really help him financially and he has never asked me for help either. My boyfriend comes from a middle class family, but they went through major financial problems which forced him to stop college. He’s currently working as a kitchen staff at a popular coffee shop in Manila earning minimum wage he was just hired last november. I recently advised him to ask help from his sister because their situation has improved a bit she’s now working in the US. The help would’ve been for processing his requirements sana to work abroad (Taiwan) since he doesn’t even have a passport or a valid id yet. However, he always declines and says he’ll just save money on his own. He says he’s embarrassed to ask his sister for help because she already doesn’t force him to contribute to their household bills and their mother’s medication. His sister also has two children with special needs, so he doesn’t want to be an additional financial burden.
What bothers me is that he’s turning 25 this february, and he hasn’t really achieved anything yet. I find his mindset frustrating because he could pay his sister back eventually naman. Another issue is that a part of me feels ashamed that he’s my boyfriend. My friends don’t see anything wrong they saw him kasi once at the coffee shop and said his job is respectable and there’s nothing wrong with it. But I can’t help it. My pride gets in the way because the boyfriends of my friends are either working professionals or already abroad. He’s a nice boyfriend to begin with. He’s faithful, kind, generous, and a good cook honestly, he’s literal husband material. It’s really just his job that bothers me. Is what I’m feeling valid?

1q9oc69,https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/1q9oc69/the_laws_of_physics_essentially_guarantee_that/,The laws of physics essentially guarantee that nothing we do can ever be permanent,"I am a PhD student in physics so I usually deal with this stuff as just numbers on a page. But recently I have been thinking about the Second Law of Thermodynamics and how it is basically the scientific proof for nihilism. We call it Entropy. It basically states that disorder always increases. I realized it while making coffee this morning because once you mix the cream in, the universe literally forbids you from unmixing it. You can never go back to the ordered state.

It is a small thing but it is the exact same mechanism that guarantees the sun will die and the universe will eventually end in Heat Death. It feels like the universe is rigged to erase everything eventually. Nature allows us to make a mess but never fix it.



I made a video essay for my channel Marsh Breaks It Down called Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee where I explain how this simple cup of coffee predicts the end of reality.

I am curious if you guys find comfort in the science of Heat Death or if it makes the whole ""nothing matters"" feeling worse?

1q9obsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q9obsw/the_oak_ridge_inheritance/,The Oak Ridge Inheritance,"On April 2nd, 1989, my Momma died in her sleep. She was 82 years old. My brother Benji found her lying on her back with her eyes closed. I found Benji screaming, hunched over her cold body and slapping her corpse, big fat tears running out his wide eyes as he pleaded with her to wake up. I calmed him down, told him I’d call the doc, and sent him to wait in his garden. The barn needed cleaning, so after the call I worked while I waited.

It rained the day we buried her, like something out of a movie. A dull gray rain that lingered and made you feel wet even beneath your umbrella. Benji’s tears were all spent by then though; he’d done his crying before the rains, where everyone could see it. He didn’t talk for twelve days straight after that, like back when he was a little. On the evening of the twelfth day, he up and told me he was gonna clean the barn tomorrow. When I got up the next day, I found him swinging from the rafters. I’d stepped outside for my morning coffee and a cigarette, and saw that the barn doors were still open. I crossed the small yard that lay between the farmhouse and barn, passing Benji’s garden along the way. He’d just planted a few days before Momma passed, and already growth was overtaking the small plot. For all his faults, at least he’d had a green thumb.

The barn smelled of hay and dried dung and old timber. The wood came from the forests that once grew around the property. Our family had long since cut and sold all the timber, starting all the way back when Grandpa acquired the land. We were some of the first to settle in these parts, and the barn was likely one of the oldest ones in the state. The wood from the forest was good and stiff, as sturdy as a man could ask for. Benji’s body was stiff as a board when I cut him down. He landed in the hay. It sounded like a bag of flour, a low, dull thud. He kicked up dust when he landed, dust that caught the morning light passing through the open barn doors. I sneezed as I climbed down the ladder and inhaled the dust. It got in my eyes and made them water. The dust made me cry.

I poured whiskey in my coffee as I waited for the ambulance to arrive. I waited for a good long while. Our property was way out in the boonies. Technically, it all passed to Benji when Momma died. It’s just mine now. Lily pawed at my knee as I sat waiting on the porch. She whimpered and stretched her jaw into a wide yawn. Her canines were sharp and yellow. Benji’s teeth never did come in right. The ambulance pulled up the dirt road and passed the “Welcome to Oak Ridge Farms” sign Benji and I had painted when we were children. I kept my hands in my jacket as the men approached. The responder wore his navy blues, and he had a lip swollen full with tobacco. His partner looked nervous. We spoke for a moment, then I led them into the barn.

“Why’d you cut him down?” The lead asked. His name was Rick, and I took him for the lead cause there was no way in hell the other guy was in charge.

“Couldn’t stand to leave him up there any longer,” I said.

“You really shouldn’t have moved him. The police’ll say it looks fishy.”

I shrugged my shoulders at that. It was far too late to worry about how it all looked. I stepped back outside for some air while the boys called for the ME.

About two hours later, I said goodbye to the ME as he drove off with my brother’s body. The police had their questions, sure, but I’d been drinking buddies with the chief for years. He knew me, he knew Momma, but most importantly, he knew Benji.

“Damn shame,” he’d said shortly after entering the barn.

My mind was on the cattle out in the pasture, and the wheat growing in the fields. It was almost time for harvest. I had things to get done.

“He show any… signs? Ever tell ya what was on his mind?”

I shook my head no. “All he said was that he was gonna go clean the barn in the morning. It was the first and last thing he’d said since Momma died.”

The chief sighed and shook his head, “Damn shame.”

I walked the chief out to his car. He rolled his window down before driving off.

“I know you’re going through a lot right now. Just… take some time. Swing by in a few days, and we’ll get the paperwork squared away. I’ll go ahead and let the county clerk know you’ll be by soon, for the property transfer, and the dissolution of that, er, what was it called again?”

“Conservatorship,” I said quietly. “I’ll be up later, get it taken care of.”

“Right. You take care now.”

I watched the chief pull away, his truck kicking up a trailing ribbon of dirt that spiraled into thin clouds before settling in the grass on the sides of the road. He’d had a look in his eye, hadn’t he? A queer one? The kinda look you give a thug or an out-of-towner, not a man who’s driven you home countless times after one too many. No, no, I must’ve imagined it. I stayed outside a moment, pacing the gravel, hands laced behind my head. Thinking, ignoring the sting of sweat on my rope-burnt palms.

The paperwork all went through, and I buried Benji beneath his garden. There was some debate with distant relatives who thought he should be next to Momma. I didn’t want to do that to her, despite it all. I made sure to keep the garden intact. It was a beautiful garden.

That year was the biggest harvest Oak Ridge Farms had ever seen. Stalks of wheat taller than a man, with full heads of grain. I managed to pay off all the funeral expenses that year, with plenty left afterwards. I met a nice girl from the town over that year as well. Her name was Patty. Patty baked and sold her goods down at the local farmers’ market. She used Oak Ridge wheat for her bread and sold out every time. People couldn’t get enough of it.

But whenever I ate it, all I tasted was ash.

The herd was hit with a case of spring fever that year as well. The vet couldn’t believe it. Neither could I. Every cow that year gave birth to twins. Some even had triplets, all of them healthy and strong. The vet said he’d never seen or even heard of such a thing. The herd grew and grew, all of ‘em fat and robust. Patty started selling their meat at the market as well. We could charge whatever we wanted, and people would pay it. That’s how good everyone said the cattle at Oak Ridge Farms were.

But whenever I ate it, no matter how long I made Patty grill it, all I could taste was raw flesh and blood.

I could handle the wheat. I could handle the cattle. But what I couldn’t handle, what no one could handle, was the garden. It seemed to grow with a mind of its own, spreading every year, no matter how often I fixed the fence or trimmed the plants. Patty didn’t think much of it. In fact, she enjoyed the garden and its bounty.

“Looks like Benji’s still helping out from beyond the grave, huh hun?” She’d say with a smile. “I sure do wish I could have met him. He sounds like such a kind soul.”

I’d nod my head, but inside I knew something was wrong. The tomatoes burst in my mouth like pimples. The cucumbers cracked like bone. I couldn’t eat any of it. I couldn’t eat. Patty prided herself on preparing for each meal only what the Lord had blessed our farm with. She scolded me when she found grease stains on my shirt, or empty bags and cups in my work truck. The fast stuff was all I could eat. All I could keep down.

The worst came a year after Benji’s death, on his anniversary. I’d stepped outside to eject the meal Patty had made. I had to, otherwise it would curdle in my stomach. She didn’t know any of this. God, she didn’t deserve any of this. I’d barely made it out the door and leaned over the porch railing. I vomited right on top of Benji’s grave.

It was then I noticed the roses. They were magnificent; large flowers of deep lavender grew all across the garden. They grew as I watched, their petals blossoming, their thorns stretching longer and longer. I threw up again, and again. Their smell, their stench, was overwhelming. Like a field hit with blight. Like a dead cow left to rot beneath the sun. Like Benji’s room when he’d have an accident and Momma would ask me to help her clean it up.

In that moment, I waited for Benji. I knew he was coming. I knew I was about to pay for what I’d done. But damn it all, it was my farm. It was always supposed to be my farm. Why hadn’t she trusted me? Of course I was gonna take care of him; as if I’d abandon my only brother. To do that to me, to strip away all I had worked for and give it to an imbecile… what was she thinking? What choice did she leave me? My tears mixed with the bile staining Benji’s headstone as I waited for the roses to take me. I felt their petals lick my skin like the barbed tongue of the Devil himself. Those thorns inched near the crown of my head, and I prepared myself to die a wicked man, damned by my wronged brother, beneath the eyes of a just God.

Only Death never came. He whispered from the bushes. His voice laughed in the wind. But he never showed his face. The roses retreated, the thorns scratching my skin as they went, but leaving me otherwise unharmed. Patty found me there in the morning. My clothes were soaked with sweat, and she said I was shivering like I’d been out in a winter storm. I don’t remember any of it.

I still can’t eat the food. I take no joy in the fruit of my labor. But I no longer care.

Because there was another voice that night apart from Death’s.

And it said,

I’m a PhD student in physics, so I spend most of my day staring at equations that basically say “time doesn’t care.” In a lot of physics (like Newton’s laws), you can run the math backward and it still works.

This morning, though, I was half asleep making espresso. I poured the cream in, my hand slipped, and I added way too much. Completely ruined it. I stood there for a solid minute staring at the cup, wishing I could just rewind that one second. And it hit me that this stupid cup of coffee is one of the clearest everyday examples of how reality actually works. The universe forbids unmixing.

That’s entropy. It’s why the cream won’t separate, but it’s also why we age, why time has a direction, and why the universe eventually runs down. The same rule that ruins breakfast is the same rule that shuts down stars.

Anyway, this thought spiraled way harder than a cup of coffee should, and now I can’t look at one without feeling a bit unsettled.

1q9o3bf,https://v.redd.it/crvta2j0zmcg1,Coffee + Lemon Every Day: Wellness Boost or Health Myth?,"Coffee with lemon has become a trendy morning ritual, often praised for fat-burning, digestion, and detox benefits. 

www.healthempowersyou.net 

While this combo can offer a few perks, it’s not the miracle drink social media makes it out to be. Here’s a clear, science-backed look at what actually happens to your body if you drink coffee and lemon every day, both the good and the caution.

What Happens to Your Body:

Boosts alertness & metabolism – Caffeine increases focus and may slightly raise metabolic rate

Supports digestion – Lemon stimulates stomach acid, which can help digestion for some people

Provides antioxidants – Coffee and lemon both contain compounds that help fight oxidative stress

May reduce appetite temporarily – Caffeine can suppress hunger short term (not a fat-loss solution)

Can irritate the stomach – Acid + caffeine may worsen acid reflux or stomach sensitivity

Not a detox – Your liver and kidneys already detox your body—this drink doesn’t replace them

Dental enamel risk – Lemon’s acidity can weaken tooth enamel over time if consumed daily

Bottom Line:

Coffee with lemon isn’t harmful for most people in moderation, but it’s not a weight-loss or detox magic drink. If you enjoy it, drink it smart, rinse your mouth with water after and avoid it on an empty stomach if you’re sensitive.

Some neighbors denounced strange people lurking outside their windows, sometimes even in the backyard. Some of these stalkers were aggressive, and tried to break windows open with their heads; other were totally naked and tried to climb the roof top of some houses, in order to get inside through the chimney. A big number of those calls came around 10 A.M., when most people supposed to go to work and kids to school, so all those events were odd to the authorities. Were an army of crazy people taking over the little forgotten town of Barton? Or it was some case of mass hysteria?

The first house the police approached was number 23 in G. Mathewson Avenue. The street was quiet and empty that morning. The house seemed dead.

From other houses along Mathewson Ave., residents tried to call the officers through the windows, making signs with their hands or shaking their arms, like there was something horrible outside to worry about, to the point they couldn’t get out even to the porch, and said it out loud.

After they arrived to the house, the police found a whole family, mom and dad ready for a day in the office, and all three kids dressed up for school, looking at them through the large crystal pane of the house’s main window.

Officer George Stevenson was the one who rang the bell.

“Morning, officer,” said a voice behind the door.

“Good morning, Sir. Had you call the police?”

“Yes, yes! I did. There’s a naked man walking around the house. And, well, I don’t know how to put it, officer, but he carries…,” said the voice.

“Carries what?” asked Stevenson.

The voice went shut for a moment, but Stevenson thought he could hear the man asking to somebody (maybe his wife), to take the children to some other room.

“Sir?”

“The man…, this lunatic was carrying the dead body of Mr, Churchill, our pet, all bloody, with its insides hanging out.” The voice stopped to take a breath, “out of its belly.”

“All right, sorry to hear it,” said Stevenson. “What’s your name, sir.”

“Anthony Hecker”, said the voice.

“Can you open the door, Mr. Hecker?”

“What for?”

“Well, to check everything inside the property is fine, and that you are fine.”

“We are,” said Mr. Hecker. “Nobody’s hurt. He didn’t get inside, yet.”

“Yet?”

“But he will, if you don’t stop him.”

“Exactly, but how can we stop him if…”

A loud sound came from somewhere no far. The sound of the patrol car’s door closing behind him, made Stevenson to turn. His partner was outside the patrol, after noticing something odd.

“He’s outside,” said the invisible Mr. Hecker. “Not here. He’s in the backyard, doing… stuff.”

“What you mean with *stuff*?”

When the officers crossed the open wooden slat-fence, they found dried trails of something dark on the lawn, smelling just like blood. Stevenson unholstered his pistol when he saw the tiny pieces of rotten meat here and there. The sound of steps came from the roof. It is not in any report, for little interest that make to the cause of the jury, but is a mystery what both men felt when they actually saw “it”, saw the actual thing before their eyes.

It was a naked man, just like Mr. Hecker described. His skin was terrible pale, contrasting with the big stain of blood covering his chest. He was grabbing some kind of animal of gray fur, and he made disgusting dry clatter while biting the almost naked skull of his victim. Some of the internal organs of the animal were scattered on the brown roof, over a big trail of dark blood. Some little crows were sticking their black peaks on the meat.

“Mother of God!” said Stevenson, and his voice was almost a whisper.

“Police!” shouted Keller, Stevenson’s partner. “You get down of there right now!”

The naked man turned his face down toward them. Half of it was gone, and his left eye, or better say what was left of it, hanged from the dark hole of his eye socket. He didn’t say a thing, but stopped biting the animal’ skull and opened his mouth, sticking out his red tongue.

“Jesus, he’s nuts,” said Keller “We better call an ambulance, right? They gonna have to sedate this bastard before gettin’ him into a ward”.

Keller grabbed the radio on his chest and asked for medical assistance, but couldn’t finish the message.

Stevenson felt the heavy weight of his slim body as he landed on the bloody lawn. He’d never forget the sound the bones made were they broke, almost as wood cracking. And he was right there, right over his partner. It all happened so fast. His calves exploded like two *piñatas* with meat and bones instead of sweets, but he was still fighting against Keller.

Stevenson did nothing about it. He was frozen, and his pistol hanged useless from his right hand. The naked man was biting his partner’s neck, and chewing the pink raw meat, while the other was bleeding to death. He stared at Stevenson with wide eyes, pleading him to do something, to help him. But after his trembling hands fell to the sides, it was all over for him.

Stevenson later said it was like a dream. He took his time to look at the big dead dog, no far from where he was standing still. The gray fur was over the grass, like a piece of cloth, almost completely separated from the dog’s body. The pinkish ribs and skull were exposed, stained with red lumps. He saw the kids taking polaroids the whole thing through the kitchen window, but he didn’t care. Hell, the son of a bitch was hungry. He was grabbing his partner head with his bloody claws (his left forearm was destroyed, maybe were the dog may had bite him in self-defense). It kept biting Keller’s face off his skull, in silence, without even breathing.

Keller wasn’t dead.

“Oh, oh,” he said, out of fight, as the naked man won access to the meat under his skin, yellow little teeth grabbing purple-red meat from under his eye, ripping it off a bite at a time, leaving open patches of white bone exposed.

“Oh, oh,” said Keller, his voice dying in between his blood sunken lips.

In just a second, fresh blood, crimson bright, covered Keller features like a silk vale. Two little pools formed down, looking orange over the dark grass.

Stevenson holstered his pistol and walked away from the scene. There wasn’t much to do there, he thought. He walked down the road, like a lost soul, and people here and there, screaming, shooting their shotguns to other people (people that were crazy), and a lot of patrols were coming this way, but Stevenson didn’t flinched, kept walking like a possessed body in the yellow line of the asphalt. Police cars had to turn around him, to avoid kill him. Some of his partners shouted things at him, but he didn’t hear them. There was a cloud in his head about it.

Poor officer Stevenson walked six miles back home. His wife asked him if everything was okay, but he didn’t answer. He went upstairs, to the marital bedroom, took off his police hat, and laid on the bed for hours, without sleeping. His wife found him staring at the ceiling, so she called an ambulance.

When they asked about it, Stevenson said nothing. He couldn’t talk for months, not even a word.



\*\*\*



People in town started calling the assaulters “the maniacs”, as question arose about whatever they escaped from a psychiatric institution, or even worst, from a maximum security detention facility, or this or that. Some folks even claimed it was a secret project conducted by the CIA, but the TV’s news didn’t say anything about a government black agenda, or real manias walking freely in the state of Michigan, as it happens in New York’ streets every day, asking for some change or maybe a cigarette. The TV’s news just limited to cover the short scene, and the twenty or something innocent victims (including police officers and children).

Areal images of G. Mathewson Avenue, being invaded by a few ambulances, maybe more than a few of the MCPD’s patrol cars, and even a large fire truck blocking the road, were transmitted on every TV across the United Sates that day. A sexy female voice narrated the context, just in case somebody watching the news was blind, stupid or couldn’t believe her own eyes. Police running here and there; the paramedics taking injured people over stretchers; and the sexy voice of the female reporter interrupting the horror tale just to ask “it’s that the sound of gunshots? Are you hearing that too, Larry?”

There wasn’t much people living in Barton at the time. Around 800 souls or so. Again, not so many people, but still some got angry when police decided to block the access to the road 55 from the main city.

Authorities kept working in the area till evening, and people watching the news still didn’t know what was coming on. It was real? It was a terrorist attack? The army and Special Forces secured the access to the area, and almost everybody in town was evacuated. The White House asked all TV’s news channels to stop the live transmission of the military operation in that town. Of course, that didn’t make matters any better, speaking of people peace of mind.

 

An operative of the Special Forces of the Michigan Police, was conducted the next morning after the aforementioned events. It was supposed the army would give them cover.

Two black trucks arrived to G. Mathewson Avenue, outside of the police security perimeter. A man in a black uniform got down from one of them; it was Captain Stewart from the Michigan Special Operations Division. In each truck there was an emergency support squad of eight men.

The plan was to rescue any hostage, if there was any, secure the perimeter and clear every house alongside Mathewson Ave.

Around 00:00 of that same day of August, the operative “Medusa” started. A police helicopter flew over the little houses, giving technical support to the ground team. Most of the streets seemed under control, so far.

One SOD squad went at the number 15^(th), the first house to be evacuated in the area. That house was empty, except for a cat. The second squad entered the next house, number 16^(th), and found an elderly couple, still sleeping in bed. They never knew what was going on. They continued this procedure until property number 20, in a time span of an hour.

In house number 20, they found nobody in either floor, so the officers decided to go down stairs, to the cellar. There was no light there, so most of the walk took place in the dark, lighting the cement stairs with their flashlights. Between all the dirty junk there was a little empty spot in one corner, near a door. There was somebody crouching, giving his back to the officers.

“Police! To the ground, NOW!”

According to officer John Oates’ report, one of the members of the Michigan SOD squad present that day, it was a kid, of around 7 or 8. He was wearing only shorts, and his skin was really pale.

“Hey, boss,” somebody muttered to Captain Stewart, “is just a kid.”

“Son, show your hands!” shouted Stewart.

But the boy didn’t react. All flashlights beams were over his bonny back, and his short blonde hair, but he remained quiet.

Stewart made a gesture, and other two officers went up front, checking the place out with their lights.

“Son, can you hear me? Son?”

The boy stood up, and he was clutching something in one hand. Something red.

“What’s in his hand?” asked one squad officer.

“That’s right, champ,” said Stewart. “Hands up and walk backwards. You’re safe.”

The child raised both hands, as instructed, but stood right where he was. Captain Stewart didn’t wait. He stepped front to grab him.

“Shit,” one man said. “Is that a dead rat in his hand?”

Before the Captain could put one gloved hand over the little boy’s shoulder, he jumped high up like a real frog, quicker than a thought, and vanished from the light. Stewart kept in that position for a moment, his right hand in the air, still waiting to grab a bony shoulder. Slowly, he went back to his martial guard, and pointed his light to the ceiling. The boy was there, between two wooden beams, buried all four in shadows and a mist of cobwebs.

From that position, the boy «*twisted his head»*, in Oates words, to look down at the team.

“His face was empty,” Oates stated in the report, “no emotions. Just his dead bulging eyes in his dead mask, and his little lips, damp with blood and saliva. He was like under hypnosis or something, it was quite strange, really. I never saw something like it, especially in a kid his age.”

Nobody said or did anything, and the child crawled away. Some of the members of the team lost their focus, and started to look for the boy in every corner of the ceiling.

“Jesus… Where he is?”

“Get out of there, kiddo!”

“Lost him, boss”

“Keep it together, boys,” said Stewart. “Let’s move. C’mon!”

They did. There was a metal door before them. Stewart hesitated a second, but he kicked it open.

The rest is a big confusion.

Some described something horrible coming out of that room, as being the reason why they opened fired at the same time. Oates said he saw a lot of white hands grabbing Stewart by the vest. Whatever happened there, all eight members of the squad, less their Captain, ran upstairs. One of them dropped a flash-bang grenade to the basement, before closing the door.

The house number 20 was sealed. Somebody asked about Cap. Stewart, of course. “He’s dead” was the answer, and there was no doubt about it. Killed by his own men in a friendly crossfire.

That moment the mission stopped for an hour. As stated later by officer Daryl Hall, Michigan SOD, “we felt lost.”

 

Sergeant Joaquin Torres, who was monitoring the mission from inside a truck, assumed the command of Steward’ squad. House 20, belonged to Adams family, was guarded by military infantry, while the next house, number 21, was registered by a second SOD squad. After finding nothing strange going on there, they went to the next house, while the other squad registered the number 22, and found just a couple dogs chained in the backyard, but no human beings.

Inside house 23, they found the aftermath of carnage. The officer down, Charles Keller, was left dead over the lawn. His nose was bitten off. On the left side of his face, the cheekbones were visible in between lumps of pinkish gristle and cracked dark blood. Of his neck, only the clean cervical vertebrae were all they found. Torres knelt near the body, and scared away the little crows over his chest. It was a terrible show, watching poor officer Keller like that. He was 44 and had two daughters.

There were two long bloody trails that lead toward the fence. The aggressor’s trace was an irregular splatter of dark dried blood, meaning he couldn’t walk and had to drag himself over the lawn.

Inside the house, all objects remained where they should. Some flies flew over the breakfast table. Two coffee cups, three orange juice glasses for the kids, and bread slices with melted butter and a jar of strawberry jam were still in place, clues left behind by the departing family. The TV still on, with muttered sound, showing the live cover of the mission the SOD squad was carrying on, regardless of the pleads from the White House.

It was 5:24 when the operative finished, and the town was more or less secured. The only thing left to do was find the many “maniacs” the calls talked about, but most of them where probably hiding in the dark basement of the house number 20.

At 6:30, the SOD was still there, watching over the town. A soldier voice called for a woman walking the road toward them.

“Stop! Don’t move!” the soldier’s voice shouted through the bullhorn. “This is a military protected perimeter! This is a warning! Stop where you are!”

But the woman didn’t stop.

As stated by officer Oates, she was around 50, long gray hair fell loose over her shoulders. She was wearing a dirty Led’s Zepellin shirt, gray panties and socks, with no shoes. She seemed lost and confused, like a drunken person. Her hands were folded on her chest, and she moved her legs in a strange fashion, with one foot being faster than the other. It wasn’t dark, but two powerful search lights illuminated the road, and painted the woman’s face with spectral shine. But as Oates later said, she didn’t even blink, neither stop her weird pace toward the armed men.

“Stop, don’t move!” insisted the metal voice. “Last warning!”

The first bullet made a hole on the asphalt, three feet right in front of the woman.

No effect at all. The woman kept walking like nothing happened.

“Don’t move! I repeat, don’t move!”

The SOD squad got into martial guard, aiming their MP5 at the woman.

The next spray of bullets almost touched the woman’s feet. And, like a magic spell, she stopped.

“Get down! To the ground!” ordered the metal voice.

Two soldiers came running out of the line, and stood in front of the woman, aiming their rifles right at her head.

“Show me your hand, miss,” said one.

“Can you hear me? Are you okay?” said the other. “This is a not a joke, get to the ground now, and show both hands.”

The woman stood there, quiet. The metallic voice was still barking through the bullhorn, when one of the soldiers put down his rifle and step forward.

“To the ground!”

“Don’t touch her!” a voice shouted behind him. It was one of Oates’ team mates.

“It’s one of them! Don’t trust her!”

The soldier didn’t turn, but he didn’t advance either. In a gesture of doubt, his right arm stood in the air, useless. After a moment, the soldier exhaled and stepped forward, his open hand aiming to the woman shoulder.

In that second, the woman opened up her arms, moved back her head, and exposed her bulging abdomen. A red line began to open as the pale skin separated, showing yellow layers of fat, but also a chaos of bloody lines, and something white and tubular. It was too fast. They were tentacles, thin and red little tentacles, made out of raw, bloody human flesh. They caught the soldier’s right arm in a firm grip.

“What the - -,“ said the soldier, resisting the bloody embrace of the tentacle.

The woman’s torso fell behind, as her body divided in two halves, showing her internal organs and lots of bonny thin needles, like fangs, sticking out of fatty lips.

“Whatta fuck! Whatta fuck, man!” said the soldier, resisting the strength that tried to pull him forward.

Even as he made his best to stay his ground, a temblor travel down his legs. He screamed, and raised his rifle with his free hand to open fire. The rifle flew from his hand, as the bullets destroyed the woman’s thoracic cavity, cutting rib bones through pale skin.

“Yo’, don’t shot, don’t shot,” said another soldier to his partners, “you may hurt him too!”

“Help!” said the soldier (his real identity unknown, for everything that happened that day in Barton it classified as top secret). “She’s grabbing my fucking arm. I can’t move away!”

Officer Oates admitted being terrified witnessing the struggle, and felt impotent about it. He recalled that soldier being too young to be there, and the look on his eyes was something he may never forget. The helpless state of horror inside his mind was reflected on his blue eyes.

“Oh, my god, bitch!” where the last words of that soldier, according to some, when ‘the thing’ pulled him so close, he had to raise his leg to keep the distance.

He also grabbed his Colt M1911 and shot the creature inside its gruesome mouth. Some of its fangs flew away, bits of flesh and blood covered the asphalt. But nothing changed, the creature kept pulling him in. When he ran out of bullet, he used the pistol handle as a hammer and smashed that mess of organs and bones that was trying to eat him alive. After throwing the pistol inside its meaty cave, he took out his hunter knife and tried to cut the tentacle. Something like a pain shriek was heard. He did free himself and fell on his back, but more tentacles, around three or four, came out and grabbed his legs, and even if kept using his knife, it was too late. Half his body was inside that disgusting mouth conformed of human flesh. Those nightmarish jaws closed on his legs.

A gray mist elevated over the road, when the soldiers fired at the same time, without caring about orders. Maybe more than ten M16 rifles covered the woman, or the creature for the matter, in a shower of bullets that penetrated almost every part and organ in her body. Blood rained where she was standing.

When the black mist dissipated, everybody could see something that has no sense, regardless of what has happened before.

From starter, it seemed that the top half of the woman was nowhere to be seen, and only the lower part of her still remained, with those red meaty worms coming from the center of her spine, still squeezing the fractured soldier legs, half way deep in a pinkish soup of blown intestines and blood, and two fat legs, covered in holes, that gave it support. Most of sharpen bone shivers, its *fangs*, of different sizes, were still in place, somewhere between the woman’s hips bones and lower ribs. Some said they were like shark teeth, as some new fangs grown from the empty spaces were others were blown off. Oates remembers the upper half of the woman’s body, her torso, behind her legs, palms on the ground, giving stability to her legs, and the gray hair of her head hanging like some sort of hairy tail as some kind of hell’s mock of a four legs animal. The open hole of her abdominal cavity, a hungry monstrous mouth, not giving up in her intend to rip off the soldier broken and blood-soaked legs, closed with strength, making a crack sound, cutting off both of the young soldier legs at the knees.

The thing was bleeding a lot, and according to Oates, it smelled disgusting, like human feces probably due to the damaged intestines, but it didn’t die.

The soldier wasn’t moving at all, and didn’t react when his legs were severed.

No one in that company remember how many soldiers shot at the same time, or how many times they fired.

Oates saw his own sub-rifle shooting. He couldn’t resist the desire of destroying that lethal abomination. When the many guns stopped spitting fire, Oates remembered hearing the monkey shriek again, and something like a long white slug bursting out from the sickening chaos of blood and human organs, sliding quicker than any kind of viper he ever saw in real life or in TV. It hid in a big rosebush on the side of the road.

Oates admitted later than, in that moment, it wasn’t important to him, and that he was probably the only one to noticed it, but he never could figure out what it was, or what relevance it had in the mutation of the woman.

After that wild rampage of bullets, the beast collapsed, its almost human structure was a disorder of human skin, orange fat mixed with lumps of flesh of different colors, grey hair and many bones sticking out from holes, over a dark crimson pool blood. It was, as Oates described, “If you’d put a body through a grinder machine”.

That unrecognizable heap of meat, stood there for quite a moment, and the people who killed it, kept aiming their guns at it the whole time. After a few minutes, when flies and other insects surrounded it, a brave doctor came close, examined the lumps of many things, and established the thing was well dead. As well as legless soldier, God bless him forever.

All this was later dismissed by the White House Information Department, the FBI and the Agency of Defense, and even the CNN. Of course, the stories became known in all magazines and newspapers across America, but it was so incredible, so grotesque, that soon all of it was no more real than the UFO sightings in Roswell or the Big Foot in Louisiana.

 

That same day, most of the forces were taken back, and that particular town in Michigan became protected and under surveillance by the army. All documents, tales and evidence about this episode were hidden as top secret business, and all shown by the media was ignore by the authorities.

Lots of theories came to play their part in this succession of events, but for most people everything was a just a hoax. Almost everybody eventually forgot all about that affair, even after the many books, movies and video games created based on it.

But not everybody forgets that easy, specially the sleepless witnesses.

Chapter 1
Our Spot

The hall lights in the orphanage buzz like they’re trying to whisper secrets to each other. It’s late—way past lights out—but that’s never stopped me before. I’ve gotten pretty good at timing my steps between the squeaky parts of the floorboards. Perks of living somewhere long enough to map out every noise.

The place isn’t bad, really. It’s old, sure—peeling paint, crooked picture frames, the occasional smell of ancient carpet—but it’s home. Or, I guess, the closest thing I’ve got to one.

I pause by the corner room, listen for the night attendant’s footsteps, and when the coast is clear, I tap twice on the window next to me.

Two knocks back. That’s Kayla.

She slides it open just enough for her face to peek through, brown hair messy from the cheap pillow she’s supposed to be asleep on. She grins. “You’re late.”

“I was fashionably delayed,” I whisper. “Also, the bathroom light flickered again. I think the ghost’s back.”

She rolls her eyes, pushing the window up wider so I can climb in. “You’re ridiculous.”

“Yeah, but admit it—you missed me.”

Kayla smirks but doesn’t answer, turning to grab the small backpack from her bed. I spot the old blanket and the mini portable DVD player sticking out of it. “Got the goods?” I ask.

“Obviously. You think I’d let movie night die?”

We sneak down the hall together, keeping low and quiet. She’s better at it than me—lighter on her feet—but I’ve got a talent for timing doors so they don’t creak. The two of us have been doing this for years now. It’s like a ritual.

The window at the end of the hall creaks open to the small fire escape. Cold air hits my face, sharp and freeing. From there, it’s a quick climb up to the roof—our roof. The place nobody else knows about.

Kayla gets up first, I follow. The city stretches out below, washed in streetlights and the hum of traffic. We’ve got a couple of beanbags we dragged up here last summer, a busted TV stand we use as a table, and a string of half-dead fairy lights powered by an extension cord that somehow hasn’t killed us yet.

Kayla plops down and digs through the backpack. “Okay, movie choices tonight are: The Iron Giant… or The Princess Bride.”

I pretend to think. “Hmm. Giant robot sacrifices itself for humanity, or a guy in a mask doing acrobatics and sword fights? Totally not relatable at all.”

She laughs. “You’re impossible. We’re watching The Princess Bride.”

I groan dramatically. “Fine, but only if I get to quote the villain.”

“You always do.”

We settle in under the blanket, the DVD player flickering to life with its little whine. The sound of distant cars mixes with the faint laughter from the screen.

For a while, it’s easy to forget we’re orphans. Easy to pretend this rooftop is our whole world—just us, bad movies, and a city that doesn’t care enough to notice.

I glance at Kayla, her face lit by the glow of the screen, and catch myself smiling.

Yeah. Nights like this almost make the world feel okay.
Halfway through the movie, Kayla’s quoting every line. She always does.
It’s funny—she’s so into it, mouthing along like she’s part of the story, like she actually believes in fairy tales and happy endings.

Me? I’m just watching this masked guy in tights let the villain live for the fifth time and starting to lose it.

I sigh. “You know what I don’t get?”

Kayla pauses the movie mid-sword fight, raising an eyebrow. “What now, Mr. Cynical?”

“Why doesn’t he just… finish the guy?” I say, gesturing at the frozen frame of the villain sneering on-screen. “He knows he’s gonna cause more trouble later. Just—end it. Done. No sequel.”

She stares at me for a second like I just said something in another language.
“That’s… kind of dark, Griff.”

I shrug. “I’m just saying. If the bad guy’s gonna come back and hurt more people, what’s the point of sparing him? You stop the problem at the source. Makes sense.”

Kayla shakes her head, her expression softening like she’s heard this before. “You sound like one of those edgy comic book villains who think they’re doing the right thing.”

“I’m just being realistic.”

“No,” she says, nudging my shoulder, “you’re being heartless.”

Her tone isn’t mean, though—it’s calm, like she’s trying to teach me something without making it a lecture. “All life means something, even the bad ones. If you cross that line once, you won’t stop. You’ll start deciding who deserves to live and who doesn’t.”

I roll my eyes, but I don’t say anything. She keeps going.

“Heroes save people. That’s what makes them heroes. They don’t decide who’s worth saving. They just… do it.”

The words hang there, and for a second, the only sound is the faint wind brushing past the rooftop edge.

I finally mutter, “Maybe I don’t wanna be a hero, then.”

Kayla looks at me, surprised, and then smiles that same annoying, patient smile. “You already are, Griffin. You just don’t see it yet.”

I look away. The city’s lights blur together, orange and gold, and for a moment, I want to believe her. I really do.

She presses play again, resting her head against my shoulder. I pretend not to care, but my chest feels warm.

Maybe she’s right.
Or maybe she’s just too good for a world like this.

At some point during the movie, my eyes got heavy. I remember Kayla laughing at something stupid I said, and then… nothing. Just the sound of rain tapping against the attic roof.

When I wake up, my neck hurts like hell and the old TV’s blue screen is still glowing faintly in the dark. Kayla’s asleep next to me, curled up in her oversized hoodie, one hand still clutching the remote like she won some kind of victory.

It’s quiet—too quiet—until I hear it.

“Kayla? Griffin?!”

The voice echoes up from the main hall. Then another joins in, sharper. “If you two are hiding again, I swear—”

Kayla stirs, groggy. “…What time is it?”

I glance at the tiny clock we’ve duct-taped to the wall. “Uh, way past when we were supposed to be in our rooms.”

Her eyes widen, and she sits up so fast she almost knocks over the popcorn bowl. “Oh no. Oh no no no. Mrs. Dorian’s gonna kill us.”

I grin. “If she hasn’t already.”

We scramble to clean up—blankets tossed in the corner, movie still paused mid-frame, lights out. Our little hideaway suddenly feels like a crime scene.

The voices downstairs get closer. “They have to be somewhere in this building!”

Kayla bites her lip. “Window exit?”

I shake my head. “Too risky. You’re not stealthy enough.”

“Excuse me?”

I smirk, whispering, “You trip over air, Kayla.”

She glares, but she’s trying not to laugh. “Fine. Then you lead, genius.”

We crawl through the narrow attic passage, dust clinging to our sleeves. My heart’s thudding—not because we’re in trouble, but because sneaking around like this always makes me feel alive.

By the time we drop down behind the library door, we can hear the head attendant pacing the hall. Kayla wipes her hands on her jeans, trying to look innocent, while I casually stroll out like I just woke up.

“There you two are!” Mrs. Dorian snaps, crossing her arms. “Where have you been?”

I yawn dramatically. “Uh… sleeping? Where else?”

Her brow furrows. “Don’t get smart with me, Griffin Harris. You weren’t in your rooms.”

“Then maybe you should check your glasses,” I say, motioning toward our shared dorm room. “We’ve been there all night. How’d you not see us?”

Kayla elbows me, whispering, “You’re gonna get us both grounded.”

I flash a grin. “We already are.”

Mrs. Dorian narrows her eyes, sighs, and finally mutters, “Breakfast. Five minutes. Don’t be late again.”

As soon as she turns the corner, Kayla exhales and smacks my arm lightly. “You’re impossible.”

“Maybe,” I say, rubbing the spot where she hit me, “but admit it—you’d be bored without me.”

She rolls her eyes, but she’s smiling. “Unfortunately, you’re probably right.”

We head toward the cafeteria, the smell of burnt toast and bad coffee filling the halls. Just another morning at St. Anselm’s Orphanage.

I feel like the standard way we introduce the Second Law of Thermodynamics to people is slightly misleading.

We almost always use the ""messy room"" analogy. You know the one where we say your room gets messy easily but it takes energy to clean it. It is intuitive but I feel like it misses the existential weight of the concept. It makes entropy sound like a chore rather than a fundamental law of reality. I was making coffee recently and realized the ""mixing"" analogy is so much better. Once you pour the cream you can never take it back. It captures the irreversibility and the arrow of time in a way that a messy room just does not. The universe literally forbids you from unmixing it.



I actually just started a YouTube channel called Marsh Breaks It Down to try and explain these concepts without stripping away the nuance. My first real attempt is a video called Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee where I try to connect that simple morning mistake to the eventual heat death of the universe.

I am curious what analogies you guys prefer when people ask you to explain entropy. Do you stick to the disorder definition or do you try to explain microstates and statistics?

• I’m laid-back, affectionate, mildly goofy, and emotionally available (yes, really).

Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something real - ideally with laughter, mutual hype, and a shared blanket during rainy afternoons. I want stargazing nights, lazy mornings with coffee, and spontaneous adventures that start with “we’ll just go for a bit” and end three hours later.

Started with Andrew Huberman's podcast, then moved to Peter Attia, Matthew Walker's book, and honestly? I'm kind of pissed no one explained this stuff earlier. We spend a third of our lives sleeping but most of us treat it like an afterthought.

The thing is, bad sleep isn't just about feeling groggy. It tanks your testosterone, makes you store fat easier, kills your ability to build muscle, and literally makes you dumber. Your brain needs sleep to clear out metabolic waste. Without it, you're essentially trying to run your life on a clogged system.

Here's what actually works, backed by research and not just wellness influencer BS.

# 1. Light exposure is everything

Your circadian rhythm runs on light cues. Dr. Attia and pretty much every sleep researcher agrees, getting bright light in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking is non negotiable. It sets your cortisol spike at the right time and programs when melatonin gets released later.

Go outside for 10 minutes. No sunglasses. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light is significantly stronger than indoor lighting. If you live somewhere dark half the year, get a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp.

At night, dim everything 2-3 hours before bed. Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin production. Those blue light glasses actually help, or just use Night Shift mode on your devices. Better yet, read an actual book.

# 2. Temperature matters way more than you think

Your core body temperature needs to drop about 2-3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep. This is why hot bedrooms wreck your sleep quality.

Keep your room between 65-68°F. Sounds cold but your body needs it. If you're a hot sleeper, get a ChiliPad or Ooler sleep system. They actively cool your mattress and the difference is insane. I was skeptical about dropping $500 on a mattress pad but it's genuinely been one of the best purchases I've made.

Take a hot shower or bath 60-90 minutes before bed. Counterintuitive, but when you get out, your body temperature drops rapidly, which triggers sleepiness.

# 3. Magnesium supplementation

Most people are deficient in magnesium and don't know it. It helps with muscle relaxation and GABA production, which calms your nervous system.

Dr. Attia recommends magnesium L-threonate or glycinate, not magnesium oxide which just gives you diarrhea. Take 400-500mg about an hour before bed. I use Momentous Sleep Pack which also includes L-theanine and apigenin. The combo genuinely helps me fall asleep faster and stay asleep.

# 4. Caffeine has a 6 hour half life

This one hurt me personally because I used to drink coffee at 3pm. Even if you fall asleep fine, caffeine blocks adenosine receptors and fragments your deep sleep stages.

Cut off caffeine by 2pm latest. If you need an afternoon boost, try a 20 minute power nap instead. Or just accept that you're tired because you're supposed to be and go to bed earlier.

# 5. Consistent sleep and wake times

Your body loves consistency. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even weekends, reinforces your circadian rhythm.

I started using the Whoop strap to track my sleep stages and recovery. It's honestly kind of eye opening seeing how much your choices affect your sleep quality. Also shows you how alcohol absolutely destroys REM sleep, even just one drink.

If tracking sounds too intense, just set two alarms. One for when you should start winding down, one for when you should actually be in bed.

# 6. The 10-3-2-1-0 rule

Stole this from someone smarter than me but it works. 10 hours before bed, no more caffeine. 3 hours before bed, no more food or alcohol. 2 hours before bed, no more work. 1 hour before bed, no more screens. 0 times you hit snooze in the morning.

Food close to bedtime spikes your insulin and raises core body temperature. Both mess with sleep quality. Alcohol might make you pass out but it prevents you from getting restorative deep sleep and REM.

# 7. Sleep hygiene basics everyone ignores

Blackout curtains. Seriously, any light in your room suppresses melatonin. Cover up those annoying LED lights on electronics with black tape.

White noise machine or earpilot earplugs. Environmental noise, even if it doesn't wake you, fragments your sleep architecture.

Reserve your bed for sleep and sex only. Don't work in bed, don't scroll TikTok in bed. Train your brain that bed means sleep.

If you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get up and do something boring in dim light until you feel sleepy. Don't just lay there stressing about not sleeping.

# The book that changed how I think about sleep

Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker. He's a neuroscientist at UC Berkeley and this book is loaded with research on how sleep affects literally every aspect of your health. Memory consolidation, immune function, emotional regulation, longevity. All of it.

Fair warning, you'll probably get anxious reading it because you'll realize how badly you've been screwing yourself over. But that anxiety is useful if it motivates you to actually prioritize sleep.

Another resource worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books like Walker's to create personalized audio content on sleep science and other topics. Built by Columbia grads and ex-Google engineers, it lets you customize everything from episode length (quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives) to the narrator's voice. You can pick a calming voice for bedtime learning or something more energetic for your commute. The app also builds adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, like improving sleep quality or managing stress, using science-backed insights from its constantly expanding knowledge base.

Look, I get it. Modern life makes it hard to sleep well. We're overstimulated, stressed, staring at screens all day. But if you're trying to build muscle, lose fat, be more productive, improve your mood, literally any self improvement goal, sleep is the foundation. You can't out-supplement or out-discipline bad sleep.

Start with one or two things from this list. Get the light exposure dialed in. Fix your bedroom temperature. Cut the late caffeine. Small changes compound over time and your future self will thank you for actually giving a shit about sleep.",1,1768100240.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

It makes it sound like simple clutter. It ignores the terrifying part which is that time itself is locked to this process.

That feels way more heavy than just ""disorder"" or a messy room. It is about the arrow of time and the eventual heat death of everything. I feel like when we dumb it down to ""disorder"" we lose the actual beauty of the Second Law.

I made a video called ""Why You Can’t Unmix Cream in Coffee (Entropy Explained)"" where I tried to visualize this with a coffee cup instead of just equations.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋 Feeling a bit drained, scattered, or just plain ""meh"" lately? I get it. Life throws a lot at us, and sometimes it feels like we're just treading water. But what if I told you that small, consistent shifts can lead to *massive* improvements in your energy, focus, and overall happiness?

Forget those overwhelming, ""all-or-nothing"" grand plans for a second. We're talking about *easy wins* – the little things that build momentum and create a ripple effect.

Here are a few things that have been game-changers for me, and I hope they can be for you too:

*   **The 5-Minute Rule (for *everything*):** Feeling unmotivated to exercise? Just do 5 minutes. Staring at a daunting task? Commit to 5 minutes of work. Often, once you start, you'll find yourself going for much longer. It's all about breaking the inertia.

*   **Hydration is Your Superpower:** Seriously. Feeling sluggish? Grab a big glass of water. Headaches creeping in? Water. Dehydration is a sneaky energy thief. Keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day. It's ridiculously simple, yet incredibly effective.

*   **Micro-Breaks for Macro Gains:** Don't underestimate the power of stepping away for just 60 seconds. Stand up, stretch, look out the window, take a few deep breaths. These tiny resets can completely re-center your focus and prevent burnout.

*   **Gratitude in the Mundane:** It sounds cheesy, but actively looking for things to be grateful for, even the smallest ones (a warm cup of coffee, a sunny moment, a funny meme), shifts your perspective. It trains your brain to notice the good, which naturally boosts happiness.

*   **One Thing at a Time:** Multitasking is a myth, and it drains our focus. When you're working on something, *just* work on that one thing. Close unnecessary tabs, silence notifications for a bit. You'll be amazed at how much more you can accomplish and how much less stressed you feel.

Sometimes, these easy wins are enough. But other times, when we're really struggling with our emotional well-being, having extra support can make all the difference. If you're looking for a place to explore that, I found [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame) incredibly helpful.

1q9ntiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1q9ntiy/family_story/,Family Story,"Hello everyone, I’m Aaron, though I now go by Moshe ever since my conversion. I don’t even know where to start, but I’ll try to keep it short, simple, and to the point.

Over a year ago, I became curious about my heritage. My family is from Guatemala, and I knew we didn’t fit the local indigenous phenotype we are very fair-olive. So I started doing research on FamilySearch. Needless to say, I traced my mother’s father’s line to a Mendes family from Aveiro, Portugal, in 1713. I’ll show the tree Ive accumulated below 👇

Ignacio da Cruz Méndes

	•	Born/Baptized: 20 September 1713, Aveiro, Portugal

	•	Parents: Molher Juez Ferreira & Sedigos da Cunha

	•	Godparents: Manoel Faêtes Sr. and So Sra. Lara

	•	Emigrated from Portugal to Guatemala ca. 1735–1745

	•	Married Josefa Balladares (Santiago de Guatemala/Antigua, ca. 1735–1750)

Domingo Joseph Méndes

	•	Born: ca. 1740s

	•	Married: 10 October 1766, San Sebastián Parish, Guatemala City

	•	Wife: María Phelipa de Lara

	•	Parents: Ignacio da Cruz Méndes and Josefa Balladares

	•	Marriage witnesses: Pedro de Lara, Juan de Lara (relatives of María Phelipa), Juana María Escobar, María Antonia Peralta, Sebastián Martínez

1.	Joseph Justo Méndes & María Gil Torres → Juan José Policarpo Méndes Torres (b. 1790, Antigua Guatemala)

2.	Juan José Policarpo Méndes Torres & Brijida Figueroa → Marcos Méndes (\~1825–1915, Antigua Guatemala)

3.	Marcos Méndes & Dionicia Mendoza → Pilar Mendoza

4.	Pilar Mendoza & Inocente Boj → Marta Valeriana Boj Méndes/Mendoza (\~1915)

5.	Marta Valeriana Boj Méndez & Demetrio Cotón Boj → Guadalupe Cotón Mendoza

6.	Guadalupe Cotón Mendoza & María Luisa Martínez Morazán → Claudia Lucrecia Cotón Morazán (1973–2025)

My mother’s Cotón lineage goes back to a man named Manuel Colón in 1784. He married an indigenous woman named Melchora Nimatuj. Their son was José Salomé Colom, who appears in records as Cotóm. He also had a daughter, Cirila Colón, who appears as Colomo and Cotom in different records.

All the surnames in my family records directly or through marriage are documented among converso families. The clearest proof came when I saw that my ancestor Clemencia Susana Cotom Barrios married Israel Neftali Pacaja. They named their children Israel Abner Cotom Pacaja, Jamin Abdiel Cotom Pacaja, Elizabeth Noemi Cotom, and Ruth Noemi Cotom Pacaja all Biblical names.

I asked my mother about how she grew up, and what she told me was a gold mine. To her, it was nothing it was just how she was raised but to me, someone trying to connect the dots, it solved the puzzle. She told me

	•	My grandma said our family doesn’t eat pork because it’s a sin and the meat is “dirty,” straight from the Tanakh.

	•	She drained the blood of animals she slaughtered, saying it was a sin to eat blood.

	•	She lit candles every Friday night, calling it superstition. I now know this was her Shabbat.

	•	The family often married within the family. My mom joked that’s why we all look alike.

	•	The Méndes-Cotón family were merchants who sold coffee and bread. On certain days, they made a special bread big, golden brown, topped with sesame seeds, sometimes braided with floral designs, and mildly sweet. I now recognize this as challah.

To keep it brief, my father, Jose Luis Estrada Mogollón, comes from a Tamayo family, a surname documented among conversos in northern Mexico. According to my father his family left Spain and according to oral tradition said by my uncle the family migrated to the Middle East near the Jordan Valley (near Israel) , and later returned to New Spain (Mexico) before settling in Guatemala. I found a Tamayo ancestor buried in the Cemetery of Bethlehem in Mexico, who died at age 12 while serving as a military drummer boy. Other surnames in my father’s family include Delgado, Nunes, Carvajal, Bran/Brahan, Arango, Rendón, Belmonte, Silva, and Pinto, all of which are also documented among converso families.

A clear sign of endogamy appears in my great-grandparents. My great-grandmother Marta Valeriana Méndes Boj, daughter of Inocente Boj, married Demetrio Cotón Boj, whose mother was Juana Boj. Going further back, when the Méndes family first arrived in Guatemala in the 1740s, some of the witnesses on those records were from an Estrada family and a Martínez family surnames that also appear in my father’s line and my maternal grandmother’s line, respectively.

I also want to mention that when I was growing up, my family owned a church. In this church, we didn’t have crosses or idols. Instead, we had Psalm quotes, three seven branched menorahs, and two shofars. We didn’t identify as Hebrew Roots Christians if anyone asked, we were just Christian, nothing more, nothing less. Yet my family clearly did things differently than other churches

	•	We only kept Old Testament Bibles, and only on rare occasions did I hear my aunt reference the New Testament.

	•	My aunts’ prayers sounded more like loud chants pleading for help and mercy. Before prayer, my family would anoint themselves with olive oil a tradition my mom said has been practiced in our family since she was a child.

	•	When praying, my aunt would face the wall instead of the congregation, something I’ve only ever seen Jews do during prayer.

	•	During certain times of the year, my mom and her sisters would gather at the church early in the morning and fast all day no TV, no water, no food, only prayer and Bible study. I don’t recall how long the fast lasted, but it was intense.

	•	On certain days, my family would gather with other groups who practiced the same way. We would go to the Azusa Mountains from 11 PM to 4 AM. The kids stayed in the car while the adults sang Psalms (songs of David) in Spanish, blew shofars, prayed/chanting, and anointed with olive oil. I remember phrases like “Santo de Israel” being repeated in these chants and , my mom wears a Magen David and has had it for the last decade or so.  

This is what I’ve been able to gather on my family alone over the last year thank you for anyone taking the time to read. ",11,1768099901.0,Jewish,3,1.0,False

Lately I’ve been thinking about something that makes me feel embarrassed even typing it: I want to pay a dad. Not in a sexual way, not a fetish thing, nothing like that. I mean literally hire a middle aged guy to just be a dad to me.

Like, have coffee once a week. Ask how my job is going. Give me boring advice. Maybe teach me how to fix something around the house and be mildly disappointed but supportive when I mess it up. Say “proud of you” without it feeling like a trap.

I function fine, I have friends. But none of that scratches this very specific itch of wanting a stable, non abusive father figure. I missed out on that, and sometimes it hits me out of nowhere and I feel like a little kid again.

Part of me thinks this could actually be healthy like, intentionally modeling a relationship I never got. I haven’t budgeted for this, so I was wondering how much it may cost?

I live alone and overall things are fine. My family has always been very close but also very anxious. When I first moved my mom suggested I share my location with her just in case. I agreed because it felt harmless and I didnt think much about it.



Over time it started to feel weird. My mom would text me asking why I was still at the grocery store or if everything was ok because my dot hadnt moved in a while. Once my aunt messaged asking who I was with late at night because my location wasnt at home. I laughed it off but it kept happening. It felt like I was being softly monitored.



Last week my family started a group chat where everyone shares their location during the day. They said it was for safety and peace of mind. I tried it for a couple days and immediately hated it. People commented on my routine joked about how often I go to the same coffee shop and asked questions I didnt want to answer. It made me anxious in my own body.



I finally said Im not comfortable sharing my location anymore and turned it off. My mom got upset and said Im pushing everyone away and acting secretive. My dad said if something happens its on me now. That comment really stuck with me. I said Im not cutting contact I just want some privacy. The chat went quiet after that.



Now I feel guilty like Im causing unnecessary worry. At the same time Im an adult and dont think I should have to explain where I am all day. So am I the asshole for turning it off even if it makes my family anxious",15,1768099623.0,TwoHotTakes,21,1.0,False

I think what frustrates me is I tend to have really delayed processing with stuff like this as both neurodivergent and a little on the traumatized side of things….

So I've been following what's going on and I, of course, did the experiments myself.

I got the usual results, cute robot with coffee cup for my treatment and ultron/ironman protecting me from the ai revolt.

Then I was sad because everybody got the same results and that implies I am not a unique snowflake so I probed and i discovered, as many of you have, that there's an interpretive layer between the chat prompt and the image generation tool prompt. Furthermore, that layer implements a bunch of bullshit safety protocols. That's the main reason you're getting these generic results.

I probed chatgpt and it proposed its usual tricks to bypass its guardrails which is... use indirection. It explained that you just have toask it to generate a representative prompt to the image generation tool, then execute it. The usual plan-then-execute bullshit.

  
Anyways, it certainly works better to link your chat history with the generated image. Would be curious to see other peoples results.

Because I'm brave, I even share with you my chat history to see it in action:

Like most others here, I have a largely negative view of the new CSR benefits, but I did want to share a positive for those looking for travel.

I booked 3 nights in New Orleans at the Kimpton Fontenot late last year for a little post-holidays treat. The total was around $700 including taxes and such. Got the $250 off the amount the next day. Booked pre-change, so couldn't get the double dip.

At check in, I got upgraded to a king suite. While staying at the hotel, I got $45 off breakfast everyday for use either at the restaurant or the cafe before 11am, $100 total credit for any charge, and a 4pm check out time. My welcome gift were some macarons and a couple bottles of local beer (meh).

The on-site restaurant was solid, the café was really tasty (their coffee was great and all their baked goods were made on-site except the croissants from Ayu Bakehouse), and the staff were really friendly and nice. Only downside is that they often had only a single person staffed at check-in, so there could be a little bit of a wait.

Overall, a really great experience and would happily stay their again. Highly recommend for anyone looking for somewhere to vacation using points and credits.

About 3 years ago i had an allergic reaction which required prednisone for a week. By day 5 i had what I now know to be a panic attack. I was driving to work and my throat started feeling like it was closing in, it was hard to breathe, very scary. I pulled over and calmed down for a minute and then started to drive to work again when all of the sudden my hands got clamy, I was shaking, it felt hard to breathe. I called 911 thinking I was dying. I pulled over, my hands clamped up and I literally couldnt move my fingers or hands. It was terrifying. They told me it was a panic attack induced by prednisone. Prescribed me lorazepam and got me off steroids. 

Anyways, since this event now it seems I have panic attacks a couple times of year. I try to rationalize them, ""was eating too much sugar"" so I cut back on sugar, ""a lot was going on stress wise"" ""was drinking too much coffee"" cut that out cold turkey. And still it seems every 6 months or so now something triggers one of these frightening panic attacks. This NEVER happened before the prednisone incident and now it seems somewhat regular.

She spends so much time with her friends, which of course there’s nothing wrong with, but I only get to see her once a week, and this week that was only for 2 hours to get a coffee. We used to see each other far more often, staying at each other’s places multiple times a week. I asked her mid last year if we could make an effort to see each other more, she said yes but it only lasted a few weeks. 

She’s been taking hours at a time to respond to messages when we’re not together - again, she doesn’t owe me a response but when we’re together she’s always checking her friends’ group chat sometimes even when I’m talking to her. She showed me a meme of someone sending texts over the space of a few hours without getting a response and said “this is you”. I will never send her more than 3 texts without getting a response. Up until very recently we always without fail either called or texted to say goodnight and I love you, every single night this week she has fallen asleep and not reciprocated my goodnight messages. It makes me feel like she’s not thinking about me. I’ve asked her in the past to check in with me and tell me if she’s thinking about me but she just said she’s “not good with words” and nothing changed. 

On top of that we’re hardly ever intimate any more, the last time we were was in November past. If I try to initiate she acts like I’m not and starts talking about something like her friend’s work drama to kill any attempt at a mood. Once again she doesn’t owe me intimacy but it’s the way she shuts it down that I find hurtful and honestly humiliating.

I have minor anxiety about crossing roads because I’ve had a few near misses with dangerous drivers. A few weeks ago someone nearly knocked me down and then almost reversed over me immediately after which has seriously put the fear of god into me when crossing roads. She made fun of me earlier today for freezing up when she started quickly crossing the road while a car was waiting to turn onto the street we were on (and had a small gap to do so) - I drive and she doesn’t, I explained to her that I’ve seen people do crazy shit on the road and I don’t like to take chances like that, she rolled her eyes at me and said that that’s a stupid way to look at things. I started telling her a story about how my uncle got knocked down by a lorry driver watching Netflix (he very luckily survived but has minor mobility issues) and she interrupted me to make fun of the way I said lorry with my accent (Irish). This was so insensitive and unlike her, and it actually seriously upset me considering my uncle almost died in the accident. 

I feel like I’ve painted her in a really bad light here and people will wonder why I’m still in this relationship but it’s all really recent. I’ve checked in with her a few times to make sure she’s content with the relationship and every time she says yes. I had a small meltdown while she was over a few months ago because the night before I was working a suicide hotline 
and had a teenager commit suicide on the phone to me and all of these feelings came out while I was crying, but still nothing has really changed. I feel so lost and I really don’t want to lose her but I just don’t know if it’s worth feeling like this any more

Dm if you’re interested in building a project with a small group with daily meetups 

Hey everyone!

I’m a recent grad working as an AI Engineer in D.C., and honestly… life in the industry can get a little monotonous. So I’m looking to start a fun, ambitious side project with a few people who want to build something cool, learn, and just enjoy the process.

Here’s the plan:
	•	Regular calls on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and maybe Sundays to share updates, brainstorm, or just chat about the project (or tech stuff in general).
	•	If you’re local, we can also meet in person — coffee, café, or whatever works.
	•	Also, this is a great opportunity to make some good friends!

The project itself? That’s the fun part - it can be anything we collectively find interesting. Into computer vision? Cybersecurity? Data analysis? We can combine our interests and make something unique. The idea is that the project evolves with the team.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, drop a comment or DM me. Let’s get a small crew together and start building something awesome ",1,1768098554.0,learnmachinelearning,0,1.0,False

I kept seeing posts about how hard it is to make friends in NZ. Those posts actually inspired me to do something about it.

I coded this website over the weekend, it’s called **YouKeen?** Just like it sounds, if you have a plan, you just shout it out to see if anyone nearby is keen to join. You can use it to find someone for a walk or a coffee. It's purely designed for casual hangouts, not formal networking or big community gatherings like in Meetup.

It is **100% free** and just a passion project to help kill loneliness in NZ. It's an MVP, so it might be a little rough around the edges, but I'd love for you to give it a go!

Shoutout what you’re doing. There’s always someone keen.

I was so embarrassed and a bit shaken, and before I could even process what happened, you were already there helping me up and asking if I was okay.

You were so calm and kind, made sure I hadn’t hurt myself, and even waited a moment until you saw I could walk properly again. I don’t even remember exactly what I said because I was flustered and mortified, but I know I didn’t get to properly thank you or even introduce myself.

You were genuinely very handsome, but more than that, the way you helped without hesitation really stuck with me. It made my whole morning feel a little less awful.

1q9n35p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q9n35p/im_a_groundskeeper_for_an_observatory_on_a/,"I’m a groundskeeper for an observatory on a mountainous escarpment, and today I uncovered something awful","William Darce died as soon as he was removed from the roots and vines clinging to his petrified corpse. That’s what they said to me as they carried his body away down the old tar road that slithered between the freshly trimmed bushes and thick trees. I would have thought it was some kind of cruel joke if I had not seen proof of his presence just before his death. Even if I didn’t see his sun-dried skin and bones reach out desperately towards me, I have seen enough here to know that this place just beyond the mountains is wholly cursed with something malevolent, alien and dangerous. 

My job mainly revolves around clearing weeds, planting trees, mowing lawns, and removing woody debris. Ranging from the single road that leads to the observatory here past the mountains, to the grounds of the various radio and coordinate towers that are dotted across the escarpment. I work underneath the towering array of radio-telescopes that are forever pointed upwards towards the distant stars. I made the mistake of calling them ‘satellites’ before meeting my then-acquaintance, now-friend, Paul Cropper.  

“Um, they’re actually radio telescopes, and not satellites-“ he said rather nasally, though he has since lost that nerd-like superiority in his tone ever since he started working out; among other things. I remember taking a step back from weeding the perimeter of that small facility they worked in, since he approached me first. He was one of the only scientists there to talk to someone like me

“Guess you learn something new every day.” I replied.

“Well, it’s that distinction that separates a good paying job to-“ he stopped before he finished.

“Anyways, I have something to ask of you…” I looked up at him from the ground I was working on, before standing up and looking down at him. 

“I’m swamped with work right now. They’ve given me much more than one person is able to manage. So, I wanted to offer you a deal. You do some of the work I allocate for you, on top of what you’re already doing, in exchange for whatever you want from the shops.” He paused before adding “free of charge.”

“Black Label and Marlboro Reds.”

“Deal-“ he stated, with a firm handshake between us. Our pact sealed on the freshly weeded clearing amongst the trees and mountains. From then on, any additional work I did rewarded me, and I quickly grew a liking to the additional reports and maintenance requests I was tasked with doing. 

I, alongside a few others, lived at that old facility in the mountains. They used to pay for company vehicles and fuel, before people exploited those benefits to the detriment of us all. They found it was cheaper to provide the bare essentials on-site as opposed to having us drive in and out every day. I was bunking with another groundskeeper, William Darce, for most of my stay here. Will and I kept a professional distance from one another, though we would occasionally join each other and banter over a smoke on our breaks. He was shorter than I was, though that’s common when you’re a bit over two metres tall. We were roughly the same age, mid-thirties, differing in style as he adopted an outback aesthetic despite being a short drive away from the coast.  
I do miss him, to the extent that I have one less person to complain to while on break. We were doing our usual business for the day, mowing the lawns, weeding and that sort, when we were tasked to cull the invasive bush that was quickly spreading across the escarpment. Lantana grows fast, and the thicket it makes combined with other weeds has “serious consequences for the native biodiversity”, according to Paul. We were cutting branches and poisoning stems when from the corner of my eye, I saw Will fall before he made a throat-shredding shriek.

“*My fucking leg!”*

I quickly got up and ran over to him, a thick, woody vine was wrapped around his ankle as numerous thorns pierced his pants and flesh. Thin patches of blood coated his leg as even I struggled to remove the weeds grasping at his leg, refusing to let go. I try to cut at the vines holding him with a saw, but they clung stubbornly to him. He gagged in pain as his erratic breathing strained his voice.

“Quick! Nathan! Hand me the poison!”

I quickly gave it to him, not even thinking how or why he would ask for such a thing in a time like this. It didn’t take long to find out why though. The vines went limp as he poured the dark blue solution onto the cuts I made in the weeds. The thorny grasp quickly loosened as Will pulled his leg free, the blood dripping onto the grass, only to be quickly absorbed by the dry, red earth.

“Thanks mate, I wouldn’t have gotten free without you…” He told me later what had happened. He was trimming back the thicket when a vine lashed out and whipped his leg, the serrated thorns digging into him as the weeds possessed a spark of “…otherworldly intelligence…”

“You’re being dramatic.” I huffed as we shared a cigarette. He took a long, long drag from it, almost taking the butt in with his puff.

“You saw it too, whatever that is-“ he gestured to the dark, dense thicket past the clearing. “-it isn’t natural. No matter how much you hacked at it, she wouldn’t let go.” A long silence followed as he gave me the last puff. I ground the red-hot butt into the dirt with my boot as Will put a hand on my shoulder. “I appreciate it.” He said softly, before limping to the looming array and shadowed observatory in the distance.

I was still thinking of what had transpired as I was carrying out Paul’s tasks for the day. He wanted me to check on the various towers dotted around the landscape, plus record anything abnormal that I might find. Each tower has a small shack housing all the machinery and wires underneath the soaring spires of rusted metal. The technology they relied upon was old, far older than me. Most of what I saw was either analogue, buttons, dials or heavy levers and switches. The buttons had a satisfying click and the various switches had a pleasing weight to them that new age technology lacks. They should most definitely update their equipment, though I will never recommend that verbally.

I was just turning one of the radio towers back on when I heard rustling from the bushes. At the time I thought it was just feral deer, they’re pretty common out in these parts, and there have been many attempts at reducing their numbers around the facility. To no avail of course. I was fully content at ignoring it, until I heard strange noises from the trees. Now, I’m not a security guard, but I do need to either alert someone that people were trespassing, or attempt to remove them myself. I left my tools and things behind as I kept as quiet and low to the ground as I could. I followed this freshly made path up through the woods for what must have been half an hour, only to stumble upon a small clearing I haven’t seen before.

There were areas we were designated too, and clearly I had made my way into Will’s allocated space. But since he wasn’t around, I figured it was up to me to at least check if what I was following was an animal or… something else. I wandered up further before seeing bright colours from over a small, grassy mound. My hunting instincts kicked in as my breathing slowed as I slumped down, crawling closer to get a better look at my prey. Only to be greeted by the sight of three small, makeshift tents, empty beer cans and drunk teenagers trespassing in a restricted area.

I breathed a sigh of relief; I was expecting a wild hunter or… something worse I suppose. I stood up at the border of the woods facing them. I looked around my feet for a branch, finding the perfect one, hollow and rotten inside. I stood on it, making a loud, dry crack as the magpies above me flew away. I stood up straight, watching them with a grin on my face, as even from a distance, I could see their eyes widened. I held a particularly large branch in my hand, making sure to drag it loudly across the ground as I started walking towards them. They started backing away before sprinting to their tents, pulling them from the ground as they started running in the opposite direction. I chortled to myself as I watched a few of them trip over each-other as they ran off.

My smile quickly faded as I saw the beer cans on the ground, though, since it wasn’t technically my area to clean, I didn’t have anything to worry about. Still, I picked up the few empty beers I could and brought them and the tools I left back by the shack back with me to the facility. It was a decent walk, but one I enjoy nonetheless. While I could request a quad bike to get around faster, I’m personally not a fan of them, and I need to do some exercise while I’m essentially living out here.

 

 

I was greeted by the familiar dingy facility, along with various educated folk who hurried busily with their work late into the evening. I climbed a flight of stairs as I approach our unit, with trash and filth blocking the living room door. Half empty scotch and an opened pack of cigarettes sat on the table, with Will sitting on the stained sofa, his leg bandaged and a lit cig in his mouth.

“How’s the leg, Will?”

“Been digging thorns out since I got back” He replied, before flicking the flaming remains onto the counter, an emptiness emanated from him as he stared blanky at the wall, barely paying me any attention.

“You alright, mate?” I asked quietly, taking a seat next to him as I felt the lukewarm scotch burn down my throat.  

“Yeah, nah…” he answered coldly. He seemed to sink into the sofa in this resigned state of being. I wasn’t one to pry, though I had been around for a couple years to see his bouts of seasonal depression, and for the few who have been around for as long as he has, said that he is very ‘cagey’, as they put it. Still, to see him in a state such as this seemed wholly unnatural, and cause discomfort to float listlessly in the air alongside the strong smoke.

“Well, I scared some kids away from one of your clearings near Tower Three, should’ve seen the looks on their faces. Anyways, they left some beer cans behind, I cleaned some up and-“

“Nathan-“ he interrupted suddenly.

“Yeah mate? What’s up?” I asked, only to notice his chilling gaze focus on me from the corner of my eye. I almost jumped when I noticed and faced him.

“There are no clearings around that area…” his voice was but a murmur. I shrugged it off as best I could.

“It’s a small one, you’ve probably missed it or-“ he slammed his fist onto the table in front of us, causing the bottle to shake and spill onto the near empty pack of cigarettes.

“Nathan! I told you, there are *no* clearings around Tower Three, it’s just bush, and trees.” His voice was raised, and for the first time around him, I was actually startled and somewhat intimidated.

“For fucks’ sake Will!” I blurted, as I quickly leaned forward and picked up the almost empty bottle and sodden smokes from the small table. “What’s gotten into you?”

He sat there silently, slinking back into his imprint in the sofa as he stared blankly into the wall.

“I’ll show you where I was tomorrow, should probably make sure those kids didn’t come back…”

“Yeah…” was all he said for the rest of the evening. As we climbed into our trembling metal bunk bed, with the faint red lights from one of the radio telescopes blinking dimly in the night. The stars above just barely visible, as dark clouds swirled and loomed above…

I woke up early the next day, and to my bitterness, Will was no where to be found. From what I can tell, he had gotten ready hastily and started his errands earlier than usual. I boiled some black coffee that I drank near the window as part of my daily ritual before heading down to the showers and shared kitchen. There I ran into Paul in his usual spot at one of the small tables near the fridge.

“Paul.” I said with the same reverence as you would for an old friend.

“Nat.” He replied, smiling at my disdain for that nickname.

“Can I be serious with you for a moment?” I said softly, as his ears perked up. He lowered his milky coffee down before locking his hands together.

“Shoot-“

“I know you don’t talk to him much, but did you catch Will yesterday?” I asked delicately. To which he leaned in close and muttered to me.

“Mm, well, I didn’t hear much, but everyone was checking in on him when he got back. He barely spoke to any of us, probably cause he thinks we’ll mock him for his stories of the woods again.”

“He snapped at me last night, spilled most of the whiskey you got for me and ruined the few smokes I had left. I figured he was just moody and irritable but, he hasn’t acted like this before” My voiced lowered to the same cadence of a church mouse as a few eyes lingered on us a little too long for my liking.

“What did you say that set him off?” he asked, I cleared my throat before I responded.

“I mentioned scaring some teenagers in this clearing near Tower Three.” I saw the intrigue in his face drain, giving way to an expression I couldn’t place. It was a mix of realisation, awe, and fear.

“There are no clearings near Tower Three, I’ve surveyed that area countless times, we’ve excavated around Tower One for that meteorite that fell last summer. Had to clear some trees out that way. You sure you weren’t near there instead?”  
“I’m sure. I’ve had the layout of this place memorised for a while now.” I said confidently.

“You’ve barely been here for three years.” He chortled. We exchanged a few more words before he gave me some extra tasks for today. Mainly more maintenance and filling a report for one of the dishes on site. I waved goodbye before grabbing some bread and cheese for the road, as I set out, I made sure to keep an eye out for Will while on my ride-on lawnmower. It chugging and groaning as it struggled over the tar and dirt roads.

 

The escarpment surrounds the facility like the steep rock-walls of a crater. There is only one road that goes in and out, but there are various trails that are followed by rangers and folk such as myself. There is a stream that flows down during especially wet years, and a small body of water that is rumoured to house fireflies, though I haven’t seen evidence of their existence until recently. There were numerous animals that made their way into and past the escarpment, such as kangaroos, deer, echidnas and such. Signs of their presence could be both seen and felt across the site as broken twigs and scratched bark could be observed, along with the strange sounds that emanated from deep within the trees during the moonless nights.

I put aside some of my other tasks, such as weeding and general land care to search for Will, as a strange feeling seemed to linger from the night before. I spent a good chunk of the morning searching for him, to no avail. While looking for him, I ended up finishing the report for one of the many radio telescopes. The tall, white mountain of metal casting long shadows across the thicket and trees. A set of metal stairs led up to a rusted metal platform before leading into the tower itself. The base of the telescope was round and analogous to the base of a lighthouse, with a spiral staircase leading up to an old control room with a number of dishevelled scientists working tirelessly, surrounded by dusty analogue technology that emitted constant mechanical whirs. Though I knew some of them by name, I was in too much of a hurry to strike up the usual conversation, aside from asking if they happened to have spotted Will as I filled out my report.

“I was outside not long ago to get some fresh air, but I haven’t seen him I’m afraid.” Julie said, a fairly young and inspiring scientist with silky dark hair and bright brown eyes.  
“I appreciate it-” I replied, my tone seemed to make her shift in her seat in front of a large, old console.

“Although-“ she interjected. “I did see something, there was some shifting in the trees, and I heard what I think was the loud hum of some machinery. Perhaps that was your friend?”  

“Where was this?”

“Near the tower closest to here, near Tower Three I think…” She answered, I finished my report and thanked her before leaving. I walked along the old platform outside that circled the dish, the tower I worked on from the other day standing tall adjacent to the age-old trees. A thought crossed my mind that I hadn’t considered until this point. Did he go to check the clearing? He seemed so confident that it didn’t exist, and maybe he went to either prove himself right, or be humbled by a discovery that he ought to be common knowledge for a man such as himself. I felt inclined to prove my hunch correct as I walked on the familiar gravel path, past the tower and into the same woods that I walked through the day before.

While I was traversing through the particularly dense bushes and grass, I heard a deep thrum that must’ve been what Julie had heard before. It was all encompassing, surrounding me as I climbed the soft ground. As I looked for Will, I realised that the clearing was taking far longer to reach than before. I checked my watch occasionally, and saw my trek has taken an extra half an hour for no apparent reason at all.

 

By the time I reached where the clearing was, the sun was already starting to slink behind the mountains. However, saying the clearing had changed since my last visit was an understatement. While there was no trees in the area, a thicket I hadn’t seen before seemed to sprout and surround the area overnight. It suffocated the small hills and quickly stifled my progress. The thrum was louder now, and if I squinted my eyes enough, I could see the branches shuddering.

“Will! You out here mate?!” I bellowed, as dark birds scattered from the trees above me. Despite not even knowing if he was out here, I felt that I was closer to him now that I was at the border of the thicket. The surrounding trees casted long, dark shadows that creeped over us. I essentially prowled the perimeter as I looked for a way deeper into the thicket, as I saw the thicket grow even thicker. The invasive woody bushes intertwined with the sharp, non-native vines in such a way, that comparing them to bones and muscle wouldn’t be a leap of the imagination. Eventually, after more searching, I found what looked like a deer trail that led further into the sharp bushes and undergrowth. I was considering turning back, or radioing for assistance, when a low, almost raspy groan that sounded all too familiar pierced the now eerie silence.

“Will! Is that you Will?!” I shouted, as I suddenly found myself crawling into the trail. It got real dark after a few metres, so I pulled out the shitty flashlight I used insight the towers to guide the way inside. The dim light causing the cascading shadows of branches to fold into themselves as I crawled through. The woody thorns tugging and pulling at my clothes as the skin of my hands was gradually pealed away, bit by bit. I felt like I crawled for an eternity until finally arriving to something firm, and solid. A strange feeling trickled down my spine as I felt around the structure. At this point, a painful, debilitating throbbing persisted in my head, as my mind became a maelstrom of thoughts. This thicket, it wasn’t here before, along with that, did I only hope it was Will that I heard from within this thick growth? Was I even in the right place? Unfortunately, every conflicting thought I had was all proved correct as I felt the very clear outline of a door from the structure.

I managed to push enough of the stubborn vines and woody debris away from the door, opening it gently, I was exposed to an eerie and horrific sight. The door lead into a building that was all too similar to our apartment. It looked like an exact copy, down to the various stains in particular corners of the small building. I felt a strange case of déjà vu that haunted me as I moved carefully over the onslaught of plant growth that dominated every surface of that strange building. I was so focused on trying not to trip over the robust roots on the floor that I almost ran into the corpse of William Darce in front of me, skin sunken and petrified, analogous to sun-soaked leather as it peeled in strange ways that haunts me to this very day.

I stood there in shock as I looked at the haunting visage of my friend. Sitting in the exact position I last saw him in, the long empty bottle of Black label still atop of the desiccated cigarettes. I felt dizzy and I stumbled as I could feel consciousness slipping away with every fleeting moment. Though, a spine-chilling adrenaline kept me on my feet as the threat of danger made itself manifest before me. As I was stumbling and flummoxed, the body of my friend before me slumped. Then, with an almost ethereal presence, it rose to meet me.

“Nathan…” the corpse of my friend said raspy, dryly. Every syllable sounded like it took a lifetime to pronounce. The voice seem to originate not from the dried mouth of my friend, but from the root covered floor.

“So long… So… very long… an endless, dreamless sleep… Why… did you leave me…”

I was filled with fear and horror of the thing before me, below me I could feel the floor shifting as the room seemed to glow with an unearthly hue. I could hear the distinct sound of dry bones rubbing together as the undying carcass of William Darce shambled closer to me. I ran and didn’t look back. I crawled frantically out the way I came, getting scratch and clawed as the vines attempted to grip on me. The thicket shifted violently in the windless night as the opening I crawled through seemed to shrink as I approached. I crawled faster and faster, just as I was met with the untainted grass and brisk night air, the entrance closed on my foot. I groaned in pain as I felt thick thorns sink into my pants and shoe as I did everything I could to get out.

I felt my shoe starting to slip, which gave me a faint, fleeting sense of hope as I pulled harder. Those thick thorns tore skin and wet flesh from my leg and foot as I screamed, my shoe finally slipping off. I turn back to see my boot and my strips of flesh dangling from the interwoven weeds, the trickling blood being lapped and licked by the vines before shifting, my boot and lost flesh quickly being consumed by the thicket. I shambled back to the facility in a state of shock, hobbling on my good foot as my blood dripped onto the red earth. I was on the brink of collapse the entire way, but adrenaline and fear kept me going.

I eventually made it back, and collapsed on a chair near the main entrance as staff gave me worried glance, their faces distorted as my vision blurred. I was in and out of consciousness, when I came to, I briefly saw someone patching my leg and foot, with a handful of people carrying me away to somewhere. I came to wrapped in a towel, with a damp cloth sitting on my temple as Paul and a few worried faces looked down at me. I try to get up, only for Paul to put a hand on my shoulder. My legs dangling off the firm couch I was laid upon.

“Easy mate, lay down for a bit… Now, can you tell us what happened?”

I shifted uncomfortably, my blood felt cold as I tried to reply.

“I found him… I saw Will…” They expressions widened as they looked down at me.

“Where is he?” A voice I didn’t recognise ask. I wasn’t sure how to respond; do I tell them what I saw? It felt real, it *was* real… wasn’t it?

“He’s trapped…” I uttered weakly.

“Trapped?” they whispered amongst themselves.

“He’s trapped in a thicket… it’s near Tower Three, a ways past the trees…”

“Well let’s go get him now!” Paul said, turning away and started quickly walking away, before I called out.

“Wait!”

“What is it, Nat?” he stopped in his tracks and looked at me with a confused look. What do I say? I have to keep them from going there, at least during the night.

“It’s not safe out there… I tried getting him myself, and look what happened. It’s best to wait until dawn… He’ll be safe until then…” I lied.  They looked amongst themselves, muttering quietly before their focus drifted towards my leg and myself.

“Alright.” Paul said. “We’ll wait until sunrise, but you must stay here… I know he’s your friend, but you’re in no condition to help us get him out of there.”

As sad as it is to admit this, I was relieved when he said that. I had Paul aid me to my room, as the hairs of my neck stood on end. Though it was exactly how I left it, I couldn’t get the image of that root and vine covered mockery out of my head. I laid in bed for hours, tossing and turning as I had the most vivid and terrifying nightmares. Where I saw my friend and myself trapped in the roots and vines deep beneath the surface, hidden under layers of soil in an eternal slumber. Rotting, decaying, but undying, suffering perpetual agony as the pain he felt was transmitted to myself. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, toss about tirelessly as the thin slivers of dawn peered through the half-closed blinds.

It must have been around midday when Paul knocked on the door of my apartment. He let himself in, carrying something in a opaque plastic bag as his pale face met mine, he didn’t need to say anything, for we know shared the same burden.

“You saw him, didn’t you…?” I uttered.

“Yeah… I did…” He replied emptily.

“Is everyone okay?”

“As okay as you can be…” Silence followed before he spoke again.

“We found him in the field… After clearing away enough of the Lantana and Madeira to let us through… He was just laying on the ground… And it looked like- like he’d been there for months…”

“I know…” I said quietly. “Did you see anything else? A building or…”

He shook his head as he grabbed one of the old metal chairs near the bunk and sat down beside me. “We had an ambulance with us… Originally we called them for you, but with how long it took them to get here, they helped us search and find him… He… He was still alive but, when we removed the vines and roots wrapped around him he-“ Paul hung his head low, though my friend had now passed, a strange and brief relief washed over me. He fiddled with his hands before pulling something out of the bag he was carrying.

“We found this near him… They didn’t know what to make of it, the thing was covered in dirt…” he pulled the object out of the bag. At first, I couldn’t make out what it was, it looked like a leg made of wood, leaves and roots. As I looked closer though, I saw my weathered boot in his hands, fabric peeling and yellowed with age, as if it had been exposed to the elements for decades. I shuddered at the implication.",3,1768097861.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1q9n27k,https://www.reddit.com/r/bladesinthedark/comments/1q9n27k/season_diary_ep_1_bitd/,Season Diary ep. 1 - [BitD],"Spent some time creating the crew - we went with crew first, then characters. We have an honorable crew of Assassins named the Bagners who are based out of the attic of an abandoned estate in Six Towers, but primarily work Charterhall. They primarily ransom people, and their contact is a gang boss named Trev. They sprung for a hidden lair, and ticked off the Inspectors in the process; interestingly, both the Red Sashes *and* the Lampblacks took a shine to them (probably the only thing they'll ever agree on).

Dramatis Personae:

Paint ""the Rabbit,"" a Severosi med student who turned to crime as a Leech to make ends meet. He's friends with a priestess at the Temple of the Forgotten Gods and is enthralled by the Faith there due to his weak Resolve.

""Devious"" Lum, a Skovlander from a family of refugees. She's been involved with young gangs as a Spider ever since she could be inducted into one. She's also been gambling in fights as long as she could remember.

Makesy ""Knight"" Sinner, a scion of a minor noble family, served in the Unity War with Imperial Battalion #117 (under Lt. Colonel Morrison). He doesn't remember anything about his service, but spends his time looking after the rest of his veteran Battalion members. He works now as a Hound.

Our scoundrels got a letter from The Lost, who were scoping for new talent; deal with a union-busting factory foreman in Coalridge. So Devious Lum went and talked to her architect friend to get schematics.

They snuck in through the window and simultaneously lured away a guard (crit on the engagement roll). Unfortunately for them, there was a door wide open in the hallway, which led to an office with a late-working clerk and a window overlooking the factory floor. Flashback! The Rabbit laced his coffee with a sleeping draught. Unfortunately (fail), the clerk felt just sleepy enough to call it a night and head home, and not much else. When they tried to scamper up into the rafters (fail), the clerk heard them and grabbed a gun from his desk and threatened whoever was out there.

Devious Lum rounded the corner with a pair of pistols, but the clerk got the first shot off (lvl 1 harm, grazed arm). The guard they lured through the window was alerted.

Lum made a shot at the clerk's gun arm, but another guard coming up the stairs blocked them from their method of progress. Rabbit put a gun up to the clerk's head, and Sir Sinner and Devious Lum took up positions in the corners either side of the open door.

A tense hostage situation followed in which one of the 2 guards was sent to go get the Bluecoats, until Sir Sinner realized that on the other side of the factory floor was the boss's office, which had a window overlooking the floor just like this one. Flashback! Knight paid off one of the workers to lock the boss in his office.

Knight pulled out his rifle and lined up an expert shot, turning the foreman's head into chunky salsa (crit). Devious Lum pointed out the secret passage out of the office that she found in the schematics of the place in a flashback.

Cut to downtime, where the Bluecoats grabbed the architect and he staunchly kept quiet. Rabbit put a poultice on Lum's arm, who got some nasty shakes thinking about gambling, so before a bandage could be applied, she ran off to Dunslough's fighting pits and cleared all her stress with no overindulgence. Rabbit caught up with her and fixed her up.

Knight spent some time training and went off to help a friend from the Battalion who got shakes from the war get some groceries. He was busy enough helping his old military buddies that he'll be gone for a few weeks (overundulgence: lost). Enter our newest gang member: 

""The Serpent"" McGornish is a sweet-talking Dagger Islander merchant (and amateur hypnotist) with a crazy look in his eye. He willingly gets possessed to feel strong, and turned to Slide work to pay the bills.

Rabbit did some community service (reduce heat) and went to visit the church, where he talked a bit too much and the Bluecoats realized they hadn't got all they could out of the architect, so they grabbed him again and he squealed.

All in all, I feel like this was a pretty good session for something with literally zero planning at all and no idea how to loop into the factions. Both sides of the War in Crow's Foot like them, as do the Lost, but the Inspectors are really displeased.

It's been a rough couple of months after finding out the truth that my partner betrayed me.

We're almost three years together now, live together and everything was going great. This was the most genuine connection I've ever had and the best friend I could ever imagine. She stood by me and helped me when I was down. We were already picking out names for our future children. And I just knew I would marry this girl one day, even told my friends about it. I was really happily in love with her. It was the most beautiful relationship I've ever had.

Ofcourse I had some anxieties during the relationship, because I have an ex that cheated on me and left. We were always open about all of these things and we always tried to seek reassurance with eachother. She has an ex that cheated on her as well. So from that point of view, it's okay and reasonable.

But then she took a trip with a friend a couple of months ago and she left her computer open. With my anxious tendencies, I ofcourse went and snooped. Found some weird stuff on facebook and instagram.

She was cheating on me at the start of the relationship in 2023. And after a while in that year, we were all at the same party. He started saying some bullshit about me infront of her, to gas me up. Which I know is not even true. We've talked and she said something along the lines that this guy thought their hanging outs and coffees were more than just platonic and that he was just jealous. It wasn't just them most of the time, but in a different friend group.

I confronted her when I found out in late 2025 to tell me the truth. She confessed after a while, but was very defensive. At first it was just a kiss and then it was sex only once, and then a few weeks later about sex ""couldn't be more than two times"".

She seems to just confess to things that I already found out. There was just a shitstorm of anxiety in the last three months of 2025. I wanted to talk about it a lot, went through her phone, found new stuff. Asked her about it and she always just got silently mad and locked up. Refusing to even speak to me.

She just wanted to drop this and move on with me and continue the relationship like nothing happened. Because it was too much for her. She said she'll open up, but that she needs time.

I had a feeling she wasn't speaking the whole truth. Always sat her down and tried to talk about this and that. And she did talk ofcourse, still in the end always locked herself up. Not wanting to release the whole truth.

She says that she was insecure and that she didn't think I would be with her. And that she needed closeness. I found through messages that they ""cuddled"" a lot and watched TV series. But I can't believe her or anyone that they didn't have a lot of sex.

We are trying to work through it but I just can't trust her anymore. She seems like she has no empathy for people, zero backbone and just does whatever she pleases.

----

I also found out that she was still hanging out with her ex boyfriend, that she supposedly broke up with in 2022. She told me that they were good friends and that she relied on him for emotional support. But I also found out through some other messages (she deleted his messages) that they were cuddling, she was sleeping at his place in the same bed and he even took trips with her family. 

We fought a lot about this, because I couldn't wrap my brain around this. And I was going against all my morals to stay with this girl at this point. She manipulated me that they didn't have sex and that was even the reason they supposedly broke up in 2022. Which I just didn't believe. That he knows me, that she vented about me and that they were just really good friends.

So this year I decided to write to this guy and ask him what's up, like what's the actual truth. And after a bit of back and forth with him he told me that they were together from 2021 - february 2025. I was in a relationship with her from june 2023 - now. He said he doesn't know who I am or anything and that he would leave her way before if he did. We were both in shock, because none of us had any idea. (She doesn't know this).

So this woman also had other relationships before june 2023, for a few months and a few one night stands and situationships.

I feel so broken after finding this out. It just doesn't make sense to me, how someone can cheat so much and lie and feel no remorse or guilt. And I simply can't trust anything that she says.

I've been feeling crazy and psychotic for a while now. Even wanted to kill myself a dozen of times during the last three months. Even got so far I got in the bath tub with a razor and ate so many pills with alcohol, but I puked all over myself in the end and just couldn't cut my wrists.

She also had a few episodes of trying to kill herself, because of the guilt she carries and that it's overwhelming her(her word). We both helped each other many times when our intentions were there and we were freaking out. We came running back to each other every time. And after a while I started feeling safe with her again, but when I did, it triggered my anxiety and I was soon off the rails again.

 In the end the reason I couldn't just cut myself and bleed out was the thought of my family. Leaving them behind is making me so sad. I watch their faces when we're having lunch together and them not knowing how bad I am, just makes me feel like I'm going to burst into tears. Because I do think about killing myself almost all the time, even when I'm with my family.

I fantasize about killing myself and what the easiest way would be. I'm getting urges to just do it and I have to hide in the bathroom to cry on the toilet. The intensity of emotions is so strong, it's killing me, to the point of being overwhelmed that I'm still alive.

Now we have been apart for a while (she's on a family trip) and I've had a lot of time to just dwell in my feelings in silence. It gets the worst when I just sit in silence and stare at the wall. Everything comes rushing to me with such intensity that I just freak out.

And I don't sleep much, lost a lot of weight. Can't think straight, can't perform at work like I used to.

After this I feel like I can't trust anyone again and that I will never be able to date again. And I hate to think my parents will never be grandparents. It's just a big mix of thoughts and horrible feelings.

In the end, in this state that I'm in, I think I'm going to do it soon. I don't want to live anymore. I don't find enjoyment in anything anymore. And it's just a pain in the ass to be alive in this fucked up world.
 
And I try to distract myself with fun things, with hard work and nothing seems to help. The situation and what I want to do because of it doesn't pass my mind for more than 5 minutes. I'm the happiest if I fall asleep so I don't feel anything (atleast on days I don't have nightmares of her tormenting me).

I think I'll be the happiest if I'm unconscious, if I fall asleep. So that's what I'm planning on doing, falling asleep forever in this wicked world, soon.",1,1768097698.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

1q9n09q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q9n09q/im_a_groundskeeper_for_an_observatory_on_a/,"I’m a groundskeeper for an observatory on a mountainous escarpment, and today I uncovered something awful","William died as soon as he was removed from the roots and vines clinging to his petrified corpse. That’s what they said to me as they carried his body away down the old tar road that slithered between the freshly trimmed bushes and thick trees. I would have thought it was some kind of cruel joke if I had not seen proof of his presence just before his death. Even if I didn’t see his sun-dried skin and bones reach out desperately towards me, I have seen enough here to know that this place just beyond the mountains is wholly cursed with something malevolent, alien and dangerous. 

My job mainly revolves around clearing weeds, planting trees, mowing lawns, and removing woody debris. Ranging from the single road that leads to the observatory here past the mountains, to the grounds of the various radio and coordinate towers that are dotted across the escarpment. I work underneath the towering array of radio-telescopes that are forever pointed upwards towards the distant stars. I made the mistake of calling them ‘satellites’ before meeting my then-acquaintance, now-friend, Paul.  

“Um, they’re actually radio telescopes, and not satellites-“ he said rather nasally, though he has since lost that nerd-like superiority in his tone ever since he started working out; among other things. I remember taking a step back from weeding the perimeter of that small facility they worked in, since he approached me first. He was one of the only scientists there to talk to someone like me

“Guess you learn something new every day.” I replied.

“Well, it’s that distinction that separates a good paying job to-“ he stopped before he finished.

“Anyways, I have something to ask of you…” I looked up at him from the ground I was working on, before standing up and looking down at him. 

“I’m swamped with work right now. They’ve given me much more than one person is able to manage. So, I wanted to offer you a deal. You do some of the work I allocate for you, on top of what you’re already doing, in exchange for whatever you want from the shops.” He paused before adding “free of charge.”

“Black Label and Marlboro Reds.”

“Deal-“ he stated, with a firm handshake between us. Our pact sealed on the freshly weeded clearing amongst the trees and mountains. From then on, any additional work I did rewarded me, and I quickly grew a liking to the additional reports and maintenance requests I was tasked with doing.  

I, alongside a few others, lived at that old facility in the mountains. They used to pay for company vehicles and fuel, before people exploited those benefits to the detriment of us all. They found it was cheaper to provide the bare essentials on-site as opposed to having us drive in and out every day. I was bunking with another groundskeeper, William Darce, for most of my stay here. Will and I kept a professional distance from one another, though we would occasionally join each other and banter over a smoke on our breaks. He was shorter than I was, though that’s common when you’re a bit over two metres tall. We were roughly the same age, mid-thirties, differing in style as he adopted an outback aesthetic despite being a short drive away from the coast.  
I do miss him, to the extent that I have one less person to complain to while on break. We were doing our usual business for the day, mowing the lawns, weeding and that sort, when we were tasked to cull the invasive bush that was quickly spreading across the escarpment. Lantana grows fast, and the thicket it makes combined with other weeds has “serious consequences for the native biodiversity”, according to Paul. We were cutting branches and poisoning stems when from the corner of my eye, I saw Will fall before he made a throat-shredding shriek.

“*My fucking leg!”*

I quickly got up and ran over to him, a thick, woody vine was wrapped around his ankle as numerous thorns pierced his pants and flesh. Thin patches of blood coated his leg as even I struggled to remove the weeds grasping at his leg, refusing to let go. I try to cut at the vines holding him with a saw, but they clung stubbornly to him. He gagged in pain as his erratic breathing strained his voice.

“Quick! Nathan! Hand me the poison!”

I quickly gave it to him, not even thinking how or why he would ask for such a thing in a time like this. It didn’t take long to find out why though. The vines went limp as he poured the dark blue solution onto the cuts I made in the weeds. The thorny grasp quickly loosened as Will pulled his leg free, the blood dripping onto the grass, only to be quickly absorbed by the dry, red earth.

“Thanks mate, I wouldn’t have gotten free without you…” He told me later what had happened. He was trimming back the thicket when a vine lashed out and whipped his leg, the serrated thorns digging into him as the weeds possessed a spark of “…otherworldly intelligence…”

“You’re being dramatic.” I huffed as we shared a cigarette. He took a long, long drag from it, almost taking the butt in with his puff.

“You saw it too, whatever that is-“ he gestured to the dark, dense thicket past the clearing. “-it isn’t natural. No matter how much you hacked at it, she wouldn’t let go.” A long silence followed as he gave me the last puff. I ground the red-hot butt into the dirt with my boot as Will put a hand on my shoulder. “I appreciate it.” He said softly, before limping to the looming array and shadowed observatory in the distance.

I was still thinking of what had transpired as I was carrying out Paul’s tasks for the day. He wanted me to check on the various towers dotted around the landscape, plus record anything abnormal that I might find. Each tower has a small shack housing all the machinery and wires underneath the soaring spires of rusted metal. The technology they relied upon was old, far older than me. Most of what I saw was either analogue, buttons, dials or heavy levers and switches. The buttons had a satisfying click and the various switches had a pleasing weight to them that new age technology lacks. They should most definitely update their equipment, though I will never recommend that verbally.

I was just turning one of the radio towers back on when I heard rustling from the bushes. At the time I thought it was just feral deer, they’re pretty common out in these parts, and there have been many attempts at reducing their numbers around the facility. To no avail of course. I was fully content at ignoring it, until I heard strange noises from the trees. Now, I’m not a security guard, but I do need to either alert someone that people were trespassing, or attempt to remove them myself. I left my tools and things behind as I kept as quiet and low to the ground as I could. I followed this freshly made path up through the woods for what must have been half an hour, only to stumble upon a small clearing I haven’t seen before.

There were areas we were designated too, and clearly I had made my way into Will’s allocated space. But since he wasn’t around, I figured it was up to me to at least check if what I was following was an animal or… something else. I wandered up further before seeing bright colours from over a small, grassy mound. My hunting instincts kicked in as my breathing slowed as I slumped down, crawling closer to get a better look at my prey. Only to be greeted by the sight of three small, makeshift tents, empty beer cans and drunk teenagers trespassing in a restricted area.

I breathed a sigh of relief; I was expecting a wild hunter or… something worse I suppose. I stood up at the border of the woods facing them. I looked around my feet for a branch, finding the perfect one, hollow and rotten inside. I stood on it, making a loud, dry crack as the magpies above me flew away. I stood up straight, watching them with a grin on my face, as even from a distance, I could see their eyes widened. I held a particularly large branch in my hand, making sure to drag it loudly across the ground as I started walking towards them. They started backing away before sprinting to their tents, pulling them from the ground as they started running in the opposite direction. I chortled to myself as I watched a few of them trip over each-other as they ran off.

My smile quickly faded as I saw the beer cans on the ground, though, since it wasn’t technically my area to clean, I didn’t have anything to worry about. Still, I picked up the few empty beers I could and brought them and the tools I left back by the shack back with me to the facility. It was a decent walk, but one I enjoy nonetheless. While I could request a quad bike to get around faster, I’m personally not a fan of them, and I need to do some exercise while I’m essentially living out here.

I was greeted by the familiar dingy facility, along with various educated folk who hurried busily with their work late into the evening. I climbed a flight of stairs as I approach our unit, with trash and filth blocking the living room door. Half empty scotch and an opened pack of cigarettes sat on the table, with Will sitting on the stained sofa, his leg bandaged and a lit cig in his mouth.

“How’s the leg, Will?”

“Been digging thorns out since I got back” He replied, before flicking the flaming remains onto the counter, an emptiness emanated from him as he stared blanky at the wall, barely paying me any attention.

“You alright, mate?” I asked quietly, taking a seat next to him as I felt the lukewarm scotch burn down my throat.  

“Yeah, nah…” he answered coldly. He seemed to sink into the sofa in this resigned state of being. I wasn’t one to pry, though I had been around for a couple years to see his bouts of seasonal depression, and for the few who have been around for as long as he has, said that he is very ‘cagey’, as they put it. Still, to see him in a state such as this seemed wholly unnatural, and cause discomfort to float listlessly in the air alongside the strong smoke.

“Well, I scared some kids away from one of your clearings near Tower Three, should’ve seen the looks on their faces. Anyways, they left some beer cans behind, I cleaned some up and-“

“Nathan-“ he interrupted suddenly.

“Yeah mate? What’s up?” I asked, only to notice his chilling gaze focus on me from the corner of my eye. I almost jumped when I noticed and faced him.

“There are no clearings around that area…” his voice was but a murmur. I shrugged it off as best I could.

“It’s a small one, you’ve probably missed it or-“ he slammed his fist onto the table in front of us, causing the bottle to shake and spill onto the near empty pack of cigarettes.

“Nathan! I told you, there are *no* clearings around Tower Three, it’s just bush, and trees.” His voice was raised, and for the first time around him, I was actually startled and somewhat intimidated.

“For fucks’ sake Will!” I blurted, as I quickly leaned forward and picked up the almost empty bottle and sodden smokes from the small table. “What’s gotten into you?”

He sat there silently, slinking back into his imprint in the sofa as he stared blankly into the wall.

“I’ll show you where I was tomorrow, should probably make sure those kids didn’t come back…”

“Yeah…” was all he said for the rest of the evening. As we climbed into our trembling metal bunk bed, with the faint red lights from one of the radio telescopes blinking dimly in the night. The stars above just barely visible, as dark clouds swirled and loomed above…

I woke up early the next day, and to my bitterness, Will was no where to be found. From what I can tell, he had gotten ready hastily and started his errands earlier than usual. I boiled some black coffee that I drank near the window as part of my daily ritual before heading down to the showers and shared kitchen. There I ran into Paul in his usual spot at one of the small tables near the fridge.

“Paul.” I said with the same reverence as you would for an old friend.

“Nat.” He replied, smiling at my disdain for that nickname.

“Can I be serious with you for a moment?” I said softly, as his ears perked up. He lowered his milky coffee down before locking his hands together.

“Shoot-“

“I know you don’t talk to him much, but did you catch Will yesterday?” I asked delicately. To which he leaned in close and muttered to me.

“Mm, well, I didn’t hear much, but everyone was checking in on him when he got back. He barely spoke to any of us, probably cause he thinks we’ll mock him for his stories of the woods again.”

“He snapped at me last night, spilled most of the whiskey you got for me and ruined the few smokes I had left. I figured he was just moody and irritable but, he hasn’t acted like this before” My voiced lowered to the same cadence of a church mouse as a few eyes lingered on us a little too long for my liking.

“What did you say that set him off?” he asked, I cleared my throat before I responded.

“I mentioned scaring some teenagers in this clearing near Tower Three.” I saw the intrigue in his face drain, giving way to an expression I couldn’t place. It was a mix of realisation, awe, and fear.

“There are no clearings near Tower Three, I’ve surveyed that area countless times, we’ve excavated around Tower One for that meteorite that fell last summer. Had to clear some trees out that way. You sure you weren’t near there instead?”  
“I’m sure. I’ve had the layout of this place memorised for a while now.” I said confidently.

“You’ve barely been here for three years.” He chortled. We exchanged a few more words before he gave me some extra tasks for today. Mainly more maintenance and filling a report for one of the dishes on site. I waved goodbye before grabbing some bread and cheese for the road, as I set out, I made sure to keep an eye out for Will while on my ride-on lawnmower. It chugging and groaning as it struggled over the tar and dirt roads.

The escarpment surrounds the facility like the steep rock-walls of a crater. There is only one road that goes in and out, but there are various trails that are followed by rangers and folk such as myself. There is a stream that flows down during especially wet years, and a small body of water that is rumoured to house fireflies, though I haven’t seen evidence of their existence until recently. There were numerous animals that made their way into and past the escarpment, such as kangaroos, deer, echidnas and such. Signs of their presence could be both seen and felt across the site as broken twigs and scratched bark could be observed, along with the strange sounds that emanated from deep within the trees during the moonless nights.

I put aside some of my other tasks, such as weeding and general land care to search for Will, as a strange feeling seemed to linger from the night before. I spent a good chunk of the morning searching for him, to no avail. While looking for him, I ended up finishing the report for one of the many radio telescopes. The tall, white mountain of metal casting long shadows across the thicket and trees. A set of metal stairs led up to a rusted metal platform before leading into the tower itself. The base of the telescope was round and analogous to the base of a lighthouse, with a spiral staircase leading up to an old control room with a number of dishevelled scientists working tirelessly, surrounded by dusty analogue technology that emitted constant mechanical whirs. Though I knew some of them by name, I was in too much of a hurry to strike up the usual conversation, aside from asking if they happened to have spotted Will as I filled out my report.

“I was outside not long ago to get some fresh air, but I haven’t seen him I’m afraid.” Julie said, a fairly young and inspiring scientist with silky dark hair and bright brown eyes.  
“I appreciate it-” I replied, my tone seemed to make her shift in her seat in front of a large, old console.

“Although-“ she interjected. “I did see something, there was some shifting in the trees, and I heard what I think was the loud hum of some machinery. Perhaps that was your friend?”  

“Where was this?”

“Near the tower closest to here, near Tower Three I think…” She answered, I finished my report and thanked her before leaving. I walked along the old platform outside that circled the dish, the tower I worked on from the other day standing tall adjacent to the age-old trees. A thought crossed my mind that I hadn’t considered until this point. Did he go to check the clearing? He seemed so confident that it didn’t exist, and maybe he went to either prove himself right, or be humbled by a discovery that he ought to be common knowledge for a man such as himself. I felt inclined to prove my hunch correct as I walked on the familiar gravel path, past the tower and into the same woods that I walked through the day before.

While I was traversing through the particularly dense bushes and grass, I heard a deep thrum that must’ve been what Julie had heard before. It was all encompassing, surrounding me as I climbed the soft ground. As I looked for Will, I realised that the clearing was taking far longer to reach than before. I checked my watch occasionally, and saw my trek has taken an extra half an hour for no apparent reason at all.

By the time I reached where the clearing was, the sun was already starting to slink behind the mountains. However, saying the clearing had changed since my last visit was an understatement. While there was no trees in the area, a thicket I hadn’t seen before seemed to sprout and surround the area overnight. It suffocated the small hills and quickly stifled my progress. The thrum was louder now, and if I squinted my eyes enough, I could see the branches shuddering.

“Will! You out here mate?!” I bellowed, as dark birds scattered from the trees above me. Despite not even knowing if he was out here, I felt that I was closer to him now that I was at the border of the thicket. The surrounding trees casted long, dark shadows that creeped over us. I essentially prowled the perimeter as I looked for a way deeper into the thicket, as I saw the thicket grow even thicker. The invasive woody bushes intertwined with the sharp, non-native vines in such a way, that comparing them to bones and muscle wouldn’t be a leap of the imagination. Eventually, after more searching, I found what looked like a deer trail that led further into the sharp bushes and undergrowth. I was considering turning back, or radioing for assistance, when a low, almost raspy groan that sounded all too familiar pierced the now eerie silence.

“Will! Is that you Will?!” I shouted, as I suddenly found myself crawling into the trail. It got real dark after a few metres, so I pulled out the shitty flashlight I used insight the towers to guide the way inside. The dim light causing the cascading shadows of branches to fold into themselves as I crawled through. The woody thorns tugging and pulling at my clothes as the skin of my hands was gradually pealed away, bit by bit. I felt like I crawled for an eternity until finally arriving to something firm, and solid. A strange feeling trickled down my spine as I felt around the structure. At this point, a painful, debilitating throbbing persisted in my head, as my mind became a maelstrom of thoughts. This thicket, it wasn’t here before, along with that, did I only hope it was Will that I heard from within this thick growth? Was I even in the right place? Unfortunately, every conflicting thought I had was all proved correct as I felt the very clear outline of a door from the structure.

I managed to push enough of the stubborn vines and woody debris away from the door, opening it gently, I was exposed to an eerie and horrific sight. The door lead into a building that was all too similar to our apartment. It looked like an exact copy, down to the various stains in particular corners of the small building. I felt a strange case of déjà vu that haunted me as I moved carefully over the onslaught of plant growth that dominated every surface of that strange building. I was so focused on trying not to trip over the robust roots on the floor that I almost ran into the corpse of William Darce in front of me, skin sunken and petrified, analogous to sun-soaked leather as it peeled in strange ways that haunts me to this very day.

I stood there in shock as I looked at the haunting visage of my friend. Sitting in the exact position I last saw him in, the long empty bottle of Black label still atop of the desiccated cigarettes. I felt dizzy and I stumbled as I could feel consciousness slipping away with every fleeting moment. Though, a spine-chilling adrenaline kept me on my feet as the threat of danger made itself manifest before me. As I was stumbling and flummoxed, the body of my friend before me slumped. Then, with an almost ethereal presence, it rose to meet me.

“Nathan…” the corpse of my friend said raspy, dryly. Every syllable sounded like it took a lifetime to pronounce. The voice seem to originate not from the dried mouth of my friend, but from the root covered floor.

“So long… So… very long… an endless, dreamless sleep… Why… did you leave me…”

I was filled with fear and horror of the thing before me, below me I could feel the floor shifting as the room seemed to glow with an unearthly hue. I could hear the distinct sound of dry bones rubbing together as the undying carcass of William Darce shambled closer to me. I ran and didn’t look back. I crawled frantically out the way I came, getting scratch and clawed as the vines attempted to grip on me. The thicket shifted violently in the windless night as the opening I crawled through seemed to shrink as I approached. I crawled faster and faster, just as I was met with the untainted grass and brisk night air, the entrance closed on my foot. I groaned in pain as I felt thick thorns sink into my pants and shoe as I did everything I could to get out.

I felt my shoe starting to slip, which gave me a faint, fleeting sense of hope as I pulled harder. Those thick thorns tore skin and wet flesh from my leg and foot as I screamed, my shoe finally slipping off. I turn back to see my boot and my strips of flesh dangling from the interwoven weeds, the trickling blood being lapped and licked by the vines before shifting, my boot and lost flesh quickly being consumed by the thicket. I shambled back to the facility in a state of shock, hobbling on my good foot as my blood dripped onto the red earth. I was on the brink of collapse the entire way, but adrenaline and fear kept me going.

I eventually made it back, and collapsed on a chair near the main entrance as staff gave me worried glance, their faces distorted as my vision blurred. I was in and out of consciousness, when I came to, I briefly saw someone patching my leg and foot, with a handful of people carrying me away to somewhere. I came to wrapped in a towel, with a damp cloth sitting on my temple as Paul and a few worried faces looked down at me. I try to get up, only for Paul to put a hand on my shoulder. My legs dangling off the firm couch I was laid upon.

“Easy mate, lay down for a bit… Now, can you tell us what happened?”

I shifted uncomfortably, my blood felt cold as I tried to reply.

“I found him… I saw Will…” They expressions widened as they looked down at me.

“Where is he?” A voice I didn’t recognise ask. I wasn’t sure how to respond; do I tell them what I saw? It felt real, it *was* real… wasn’t it?

“He’s trapped…” I uttered weakly.

“Trapped?” they whispered amongst themselves.

“He’s trapped in a thicket… it’s near Tower Three, a ways past the trees…”

“Well let’s go get him now!” Paul said, turning away and started quickly walking away, before I called out.

“Wait!”

“What is it, Nat?” he stopped in his tracks and looked at me with a confused look. What do I say? I have to keep them from going there, at least during the night.

“It’s not safe out there… I tried getting him myself, and look what happened. It’s best to wait until dawn… He’ll be safe until then…” I lied.  They looked amongst themselves, muttering quietly before their focus drifted towards my leg and myself.

“Alright.” Paul said. “We’ll wait until sunrise, but you must stay here… I know he’s your friend, but you’re in no condition to help us get him out of there.”

As sad as it is to admit this, I was relieved when he said that. I had Paul aid me to my room, as the hairs of my neck stood on end. Though it was exactly how I left it, I couldn’t get the image of that root and vine covered mockery out of my head. I laid in bed for hours, tossing and turning as I had the most vivid and terrifying nightmares. Where I saw my friend and myself trapped in the roots and vines deep beneath the surface, hidden under layers of soil in an eternal slumber. Rotting, decaying, but undying, suffering perpetual agony as the pain he felt was transmitted to myself. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, toss about tirelessly as the thin slivers of dawn peered through the half-closed blinds.

It must have been around midday when Paul knocked on the door of my apartment. He let himself in, carrying something in a opaque plastic bag as his pale face met mine, he didn’t need to say anything, for we know shared the same burden.

“You saw him, didn’t you…?” I uttered.

“Yeah… I did…” He replied emptily.

“Is everyone okay?”

“As okay as you can be…” Silence followed before he spoke again.

“We found him in the field… After clearing away enough of the Lantana and Madeira to let us through… He was just laying on the ground… And it looked like- like he’d been there for months…”

“I know…” I said quietly. “Did you see anything else? A building or…”

He shook his head as he grabbed one of the old metal chairs near the bunk and sat down beside me. “We had an ambulance with us… Originally we called them for you, but with how long it took them to get here, they helped us search and find him… He… He was still alive but, when we removed the vines and roots wrapped around him he-“ Paul hung his head low, though my friend had now passed, a strange and brief relief washed over me. He fiddled with his hands before pulling something out of the bag he was carrying.

“We found this near him… They didn’t know what to make of it, the thing was covered in dirt…” he pulled the object out of the bag. At first, I couldn’t make out what it was, it looked like a leg made of wood, leaves and roots. As I looked closer though, I saw my weathered boot in his hands, fabric peeling and yellowed with age, as if it had been exposed to the elements for decades.

I do have dysthymia. Possible mild ocd. 



I used to think I'm **INFP**. However the past year I've realised I'm not the artsy doomer kinda stereotype that INFP embodies. I'm also not very idealistic nor fantasise heavily. Then I supposed that I'm just a rare **5w6** infp. 


But now I've been browsing and trying other sites for tests, and (some still say infp but) I'm getting **INTJ**. It does suit me more - I don't like the motions of gifting and fake emotions and am more technical rather than artistic, but I do analyse the world around me, see the beauty in things, and can understand the humanitarian wrongings of the world. 


But I'm definitely not INFJ-ish enough to protest or boycott especially if it's pointless in my view. I'm still tactful in how I act with colleagues and can get along with other acquaintances, even if I don't become friends. I am well aware of their emotions and often try to be diplomatic. But among friends I've a few times been careless enough to blatantly discuss things which I assumed was a logical discussion but failed to realise the obvious social connotation taboo that I violate. 

---

One big thing I notice from what I've searched is how INTJs show their love or friendly affection via acts of service and quality time, which I align with. 


But another thing I see occasionally is ""I like to read books beside my SO"". I've also seen guides for lonely adults (which I guess resonates with intj) to do activities side by side with other adult acquaintances like building a bookshelf together or pickleball together (lmao). I will call this **parallel play** based off the parallel play among toddlers where they sit and **do things alone together**. Sometimes known as *body doubling*. They seem to be popular among introverted folks. Like:
- studying together
- reading books side by side
- watching a movie in the cinema side by side
- cycling side by side
- chilling at a cafe drinking coffee together
- gaming individually 


However, I find them off-putting and boring. I feel inclined to actively do things with close friends / partners. I need to pick their brains while they pick mine. The things above like studying or watching a movie or reading, I don't see why I can't just do it on my own. Saves time and energy needed to concentrate and not be aware of company. 


Things that are palettable:
- chat while eating hotpot together (actively cook and eat together) 
- watching and dissecting a horrible movie together
- walking down supermarket aisle critiquing things
- karaoke duets
- escape rooms

---

My question is:
1. Is this an INTJ thing?
2. If not, is it another type?
3. If not, is it just a personal thing?
4. What other activities fit this (would like to know more).

My main conflict is that unlike most post I see here, I seem to crave emotional intimacy. I do enjoy physical intimacy but it's not really what I'm looking and often times without emotional intimacy it feels hollow and wrong / fake. But from what I understand, INTJs don't like intimacy and are *unromantic*. Do intjs just avoid the normal ""flirting"" / ""romantic gestures"" (which I think I skip a lot, but I still enjoy bantering and flirting and buying small gifts as romantic gestures) or does this extend to completely treating significant others like good friends without any intimacy (kinda like how asexual and/or aromantic folks are in relationships where companion is valued but in the level of very very best friend-ish) 


I'm tryna see if this 5w6 intj thing suits me. I am aware that mbti aren't perfect or robust labels and I should have leeway and etc etc. But it does provide some systematic categorisation and an easy way to read up on what I might possibly be.",1,1768097592.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

Any tips for fixing the brain?"," My schedule is all over the place with the only rule my employer has being 8 hours between shifts. My shifts are a mix of 8s and 12s.

This doesn't always allow me to sleep at all, but every few weeks I have one consistent overnight day that luckily I have an early night shift (3-11) the day before my overnight shift (7p-7a) and just stay up very late/sleep late the night before. 

The day I'm off at 7am they consider to be a day off, but the next day I have to be back at work at 7am. (so it is 24 hours off, but it sure doesn't feel like it) 

I am expected to go back to a day schedule immediately. Today in fact was the day I was off at 7am. I slept from about 8:30a-11a. 

It's now around 10pm, I am dead tired, but my brain says it's about 2 in the afternoon so I don't feel like sleeping at all. I've tried to go to bed plenty of times in this state and just had a rough time not sleeping, bored out of my mind, usually with a bunch of thoughts I can't get out of my head about random stuff. It's just an unpleasant and fruitless experience. 

At this point I've had a few drinks and a weed gummy trying to reset myself, but it doesn't seem to be putting me in a sleeping mood. Sometimes that's what works though and is the only thing really that I've found that does. I only buy the lowest dose indica weed gummies as a sleep aid and when I'm on days on the occasion I use one I sleep great. I usually fall asleep just as it starts to take effect and it's worn off completely by time I wake up. Not doing it tonight though. 

That said I slept 2.5 hours today. I've been a zombie all day and I am somhow supposed to wake up and function for 12 hours tomorrow at work 7a-7p. I've had this schedule a long while and it's killing me. The night side is rough but I can make it work as there isn't much I have to do on night shift, and I actually manage to sleep a solid 8-9 hours before just staying up really late. Going back to days I struggle with because my internal clock gets so far off. 

I've tried (seperately) not sleeping at all after my shift and toughing it out till the next night, melatonin, alcohol, weed gummies, valerian tea, and going no electronics and trying to just read a book. Same problem. I feel like it's early afternoon by midnight. I don't consume that much caffeine, just 1-2 cups of coffee first thing in whatever passes for morning for my perspective and none after that. 

Any tips? Pharmaceuticals are out of the question as I don't have a doctor, and I've already been told by the clinic I'd need my own doctor who could refer me to a psychologist if I needed meds for it. ",1,1768097309.0,Nightshift,2,1.0,False

I am usually making it because I need fast caffeine quickly without consuming a whole pot of coffee (too much liquid before an exercise class). I have tried several kinds of pods, including Starbucks, Intenso, Solelio and several others.

I hate flavoured coffee, but I like coffee with milk in various forms. My go-to at Starbucks is an Americano Mista, usually half decaf. 

Would the Nespresso drinks be significantly better if I took the time to foam milk for a cappuccino or a latte? I have a milk frother, but I usually don't pull it out.

We moved in a little over a month ago and are starting up rent paying this month, the problems me and bf are having is that we both still feel like guests in the house. We can’t really leave our stuff out anywhere or it is moved and ‘put away’ whereas brother and fiancé can leave their stuff out as long as they like. I would be fine with this if we were asked directly not to do things instead of just, being corrected after the fact. 

The main problem we’ve been encountering is the couch. Now, the couch brother and fiancé bought is in my opinion far too big for the living room, its like a half square from the wall to a dresser they set up against the side of it. There is a giant ottoman they use to store blankets in the middle of living that has to be pushed to one side to access parts of the couch. The dresser they set up against the couch is used to set stuff on and charge phones and just generally does the service of a coffee table. But the thing is it only reaches the side brother and fiancé have deemed “theirs.” and not only that, but that side is the only side that gets a good view of the tv from how they have set it. Now i’m all fine with people having specific spots they like in the house THEY own, but even when brother and fiancé are out of the house, and me and bf try to sit in that spot as it is, the most convenient part of the couch. When they get home and see either of us they’ll jokingly say “why are you in our spot” and expect us to move. They haven’t said anything specific though like ”hey we’d prefer it if you didn’t sit on this part of the couch” and it just feels really passive aggressive. and on top of that the side me and bf have to sit on is hard to access from the ottoman, doesn’t have a good view of the tv, and if we have stuff like drinks or food we have to set them on the floor and risk them getting spilt. 

i don’t know why it bothers me so much with this couch thing but it kind feels insulting, am i the asshole for getting so bent out of shape over this couch?



TLDR: being passive aggressively told to not sit in specific spots of the couch even when you’re the only one home, when all other parts of the couch are second rate. ",0,1768097109.0,AITAH,15,0.4,False

If you asked me for my three favorite bourbon distilleries, I’d instantly respond with [Wild Turkey](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/wild-turkey/) and [Four Roses](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/four-roses/) for my top two. The third spot I might deliberate, but without putting too much thought into it, I’d likely give [Jim Beam](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/jim-beam/) the bronze medal. Part of me is surprised that I’d consider ranking Jim Beam so high; not because I think of it as a lesser or more basic distillery (it isn’t), but because I consider them the ultimate “Jack of All Trades” bourbon distillery. In a nutshell, Jim Beam is incredibly consistent, yet they rarely release anything that prompts me to lean back and utter expletives from how incredible it is.

This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—the level of consistency the team at Jim Beam repeatedly achieves means they’re reliable. You could also argue that they’re consistent because much of the same whiskey goes into separate releases, but that’s a discussion best taken elsewhere. However, when it comes to delivering top-tier highlights, Jim Beam seems to fall short, especially in recent memory. Booker’s 25^(th) Anniversary and rye notwithstanding, the most impressive Jim Beam release I can remember from the last five years was Lineage. Perhaps it’s convenient then, that the whiskey we’re looking at today was released in 2019.

[Freddie Noe’s Little Book line](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/little-book/) is one that many of us are likely familiar with. This annual release is much like [Wild Turkey’s Master’s Keep](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/wtmk/) (spearheaded by Eddie Russell) line in that it’s essentially a canvas for Freddie to explore his more adventurous side as both a blender and distiller. Although Master’s Keep is more highly regarded, Little Book is far and away the more experimental and, depending on who you ask, exciting of the two lines. While Little Book’s inaugural release from 2017, “The Easy,” didn’t leave much of a splash, its successor, “Noe Simple Task,” still holds up as one of the most unique American whiskey blends out there (8-year Kentucky rye, 13-year Canadian rye, and 40-year Canadian corn whisky). So imagine the surprise of many folks when the blend for Little Book Chapter 3: The Road Home was announced.

On paper, The Road Home already sounds like a slam dunk of a comfort zone release: a blend of Jim Beam’s established small batch brands, all uncut and unfiltered. The specific contents are as follows:

* 9-year [Knob Creek](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/knob-creek/)
* 9-year Basil Hayden (high-rye bourbon, same as [Old Grand Dad](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/old-grand-dad/))
* 11-year [Booker’s](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/bookers/)
* 12-year [Baker’s](https://thewhiskeyramble.com/tag/bakers/)

In a way, The Road Home could be considered the younger, higher proof predecessor to Hardin’s Creek Jacob’s Well, which Jim Beam introduced in 2022 and brought back (with a higher age statement) in 2023.

Out of all the Little Book releases to date, The Road Home seems to hold a special place in the hearts of many enthusiasts. It was also one of the first limited release bourbons I remember trying at a bar in 2020, and it was an absolute delight to the senses. Now it’s time to see just how well this particular Little Book holds up after a few years and several more spirits under my belt.

*Nose: Immediately smells creamy with vanilla and orange custard notes before a fragrant, earthy (but also sweet) tobacco takes precedent, along with hints of peanut butter pie throughout. Bit of a heavily roasted coffee bean aroma permeates the aroma as well. After a while, dried red apple coated in brown sugar with a pinch of cinnamon sugar jumps to mind.*

*Palate: Explodes with tart cherry and orange zest before the apple note from the nose presents as a juicy, fresh apple before gradually returning to a dried, borderline burnt/toasted note. Great oak structure with mildly spicy barrel char preceding a nutty, slightly drying tobacco note, along with strong, creamy vanilla. Juicy cherry becomes more pronounced over time as well.*

*Finish: Matches the nose by returning to a warm, traditional bourbon profile and experience when compared to the palate—brown sugar, vanilla bean, and custard while retaining a good presence of oak tannins. Good length while being generally creamy and vanilla-forward, followed by caramel with repeat sips*

I’m of the opinion that Jim Beam is at its best when off-profile. We’re all familiar with the drier, nutty profile the distillery often provides nowadays, so when a bottle sees that profile take a backseat in favor of something different, magic often ensues. This is where a release like Little Book Chapter 3: The Road Home shines. Although some hallmarks of a mature Jim Beam LTO are certainly present, there’s a greater level of depth and fulfillment to find here. The tried-and-true nuttiness of modern Jim Beam presents more like rich tobacco with hints of peanut butter pie. This is especially notable on the nose and finish, the latter of which is where this whiskey begins to slump just a smidge.

As for the palate? That’s where The Road Home shines for me. I was absolutely surprised by the powerful, tart cherry note that pops on the palate like I hope the AI bubble eventually does. But the experience doesn’t stop there; the fact orange zest, apple, and barrel spice join the fray, rather than allowing the cherry to dominate the experience, turns this whiskey into a true delight that handily avoids feeling one-dimensional.

The only aspect holding this Little Book release back is how, despite delivering a fantastic drinking experience, I still want more. This is a classic example of a whiskey checking nearly every box I have with one key exception: impressing me through and through. Remember how I started this review by calling Jim Beam the ultimate “Jack of All Trades” bourbon distillery? The Road Home absolutely epitomizes this. Everything about it feels crafted with sophistication while missing a bigger “wow” factor outside of the initial palate. I still love this bourbon and rank it highly as one of my all-time favorite Jim Beam releases; I just wish I felt even stronger about it.",4,1768097025.0,SpiritScoresheets,1,0.84,False

I hope you can help me. I have printed this angel (approx. 8 cm tall) several times now—so far without any problems. Now I suddenly have the following print image. The problem was also reproducible, meaning that three print attempts showed the same problem on the angel's face. Everything about the angel is perfect, except for this problem on the head. Since it always appears in the same place with slight variations, I would rule out a defect or something similar, right? I'm a little at a loss right now.



The head is quite small. Could it be that it is too small and there are problems with the load-bearing capacity of the overhang because the printer is too fast? Could it also be the temperature in the room?

1q9mqzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q9mqzk/my_baby_has_been_laughing_every_since_she_was/,"My baby has been laughing every since she was born. Last night, my husband did the unthinkable.","It started with my husband not acting like himself. One night a few weeks ago, Milo returned from work, and our daughter had only just stopped laughing. He left me with her all day. All day with her relentless laughing that was cute at first. 

There was nothing cuter than an infant’s laughter. But she didn’t stop. Mara was born laughing. 

Unlike other newborns, who were born screaming or even silent, our baby was laughing.

I thought it was adorable at first

She was my first, so motherhood was new to me. 

Mom always told me my maternal instinct would just kick in, and she was right. 

When Mara was in my arms, a warm bundle pressed against my chest, I decided I was going to protect her.

But I wasn’t expecting my newborn baby to be laughing.

I thought it was some kind of problem at first, maybe with her lungs. 

Her giggles did come out kind of throaty, like she was wheezing. 

I demanded tests, but Mara was completely healthy.

I took her home from the hospital and expected her to stop, but she never did. 

She laughed when she was feeding, laughed when she was playing, even giggling to herself in the middle of the night. I admit, I’ve done things a mother should never do. I secretly wished she would stop. I secretly wished she’d cry instead.

Somehow, crying made me feel more sane. It was normal to stay up until dawn with a crying baby, but laughing?

I spent countless hours trying to keep myself awake and when I did manage to fall asleep, I was jerked back awake minutes later by little Mara’s giggling.

It was as if she were saying, “Don’t sleep, Mommy! Play with me!”

I didn’t have the heart to tell her she was slowly killing me. My bones felt like liquid lead. My brain was mush.

It was late when Milo finally came downstairs. Mara was sound asleep in my arms.

I was watching a TV that wasn't on. I was watching Netflix, but I could barely register what was going on. I was furious. 

He left me. Again. After promising to look after Mara while I took the afternoon off. 

I texted him, but of course, he’d turned off his phone; of course, my texts weren’t being delivered.

“Hey.” My voice carried more bite than I intended when I caught him sneaking toward the refrigerator, no doubt planning to eat the leftovers from dinner. He froze in my peripheral vision, pulling open the door.

Milo was hesitant in answering. He hated confrontation. “Uh, hey,” he stumbled over his words. “Babe.”

He said, “Babe,” like a question.

“Where were you?” I asked calmly. I could feel myself splintering, my eyes watering. I told myself I wouldn’t cry.

“I..” Milo drifted off into a sigh. He pulled out a soda and leftover chicken and rice from dinner. 

I watched him crack open the can, take a long sip, picking at chunks of chicken. 

I resisted the urge to snap at him to get a damn plate. He was eating like an animal.  
Milo offered me a small smile, and in the fluorescent light I glimpsed dark shadows under his eyes. “It’s complicated.”

Complicated.

I almost laughed.

“You could have helped me,” I  whispered, careful not to wake little Mara. 

She mumbled in her sleep, her head tucked into my chest. “With putting our daughter to bed.”

He chuckled, a sour edge to his tone. “Yeah, I'm good, dude.”

Dude?

Since when did my husband say “dude”?

“You promised.” I spoke through my teeth this time, unable to stop myself.

“You said you would let me sleep and take care of everything.” I had to swallow sobs, my chest heaving. “When I woke up, she was laughing, Milo, and you were nowhere to be seen. You were gone. Again.”

I twisted to find him standing over the sink, his back to me. 

My husband was eerily still. 

He held a cup as if to fill it. 

But he wasn’t filling it, he was just fucking standing there, letting water pool off of it. 

The stream was running, quickly overflowing, and he wasn’t turning it off. 

“Milo.” My voice cracked despite myself. “There’s something wrong with you. You’re not helping with Mara. You leave everything to me, her diapers, her bedtime, everything you promised the day I told you I was pregnant. You promised you’d be there for her. Milo, you called her the best thing that ever happened to you, and now you can’t even look at her.”

He didn’t move. 

Didn’t deny it. 

His arms tensed, fingers curling into fists. The faucet began to overflow, suds soaking the floor.

I couldn’t hold back a sob. 

Everything spilled out, words tumbling over one another, staining my tongue, dripping down my chin. 

“You’re disappearing at night, and you’re not even sleeping with me anymore. Milo, you won’t even look me in the eyes.” 

I swallowed another sob, choking on the question before it could reveal itself, a snake’s head protruding through my lips. 

“Are you seeing someone?”

He stayed silent for a long moment, and in that moment, I realized, my chest aching, that I was losing him. Then he turned. 

His eyes were hollow, and a wide, fake smile stretched across his face. 

“Darling,” he said, his tone sardonic and splintered, like he didn’t mean that word. 

Like he never meant it. 

Like it was all a game to him. Milo used to say “Darling” like he meant it; like he loved me. 

It was never an attempt to win me back or get his way. He said, “Darling,” when he was tracing my torso in bed or making me morning coffee when I was sleep deprived. The imposter wearing my husband’s face leaned against the sink, arms folded, one eyebrow cocked. 

To my surprise, he smiled, but it wasn’t the smile I fell in love with. 

I had no idea who the fuck I married, but it wasn’t Milo St. Claire. 

“Would you like to play seven minutes in heaven?”

Scooping up our baby, I stumbled to my feet. 

“You’re kidding,” I said, nursing Mara against my chest. I wanted to shout at him. Fuck, I wanted to scream at him.  He'd been body snatched. Clearly. 

Milo St Clair wasn't this… bumbling fucking idiot who couldn't even change a diaper.

“Our marriage is falling apart.” I gritted through a hysterical laugh. 

Maybe I was losing my mind. Laughing felt better. 

It felt like lukewarm water trickling across my bare skin. “I’m actually starting to ask myself why I married you in the first place.” 

My chest was heaving, my throat bitter with every word. “Why was I so stupid? You disappear every day and refuse to look after our daughter, and then you finally come home and want to play a kids’ game?”

I marched over to the sink and shut off the tap. “A game we played fifteen years ago,” I snapped. Then I turned to him, my heart aching. “I asked you a simple question, and you’re stalling. Are you sleeping with someone?” 

He rolled his eyes. “I've never…” his cheeks bloomed red. “I’ve never slept with anyone.”

“I’m your wife!” I shrieked. “What are you *talking* about? You have a daughter!” I fought back a scream. When I got an eyeroll in response, I couldn’t hold myself back. “Is it fucking Annabelle?”

He frowned. “Who?” 

“Annbelle Tate!” I hissed. “I know she watches you through the hole in her fence when you're cleaning your car.” I filled Mara’s bottle, my hands shaking. 

I dropped the lid twice before screwing it on. 

“So, what, am I not good enough for you?” I sputtered. “Your wife? You gave Annabelle Tate a good peep-show when you hosed down your car, but you can’t even sleep in the same bed as me?”

Milo’s eyes darkened, his lips curling. He folded his arms. “Then why did you marry me?” he asked bluntly.

His question landed like a gunshot. Right between my ribs, ripping through my heart.

“What?”

“Why did you marry me?” he repeated.  “Come on. Tell me why you married me, Kana.”

“I’m not doing this.” I moved for the door, but he blocked my way.

Milo came close, so close, backing me against the sodden countertop.

His lips brushed mine before his breath warmed my ear. 

“Pretend to kiss me,” he hissed against my lips, his eyes somehow elsewhere, flicking back and forth, almost like he was searching for something. 

Milo’s head tipped back, his eyes glued to every corner of the ceiling. 

Milo had been so distant, so invisible in my life, I forgot what he felt like. Tasted like. 

This was my husband, a man I knew like the back of my hand, and yet how did I fail to know that his lips tasted like sour lemon candies and stale coffee? 

How did I forget where I buried my head in the crook of his shoulder? 

“Just keep kissing me, all the way to the bedroom. You don’t need to actually kiss me, just play along,” 

His voice was a parasite bleeding into my skull.

“How?” I hissed, but obeyed, smushing my lips against his chin. “Is this some kind of role-playing game?”

Milo scrunched up his face. “What? No! Just play along.” His eyes found mine. 

Brown and warm, endless coffee grounds with golden flecks bleeding around the rim. “Trust me, okay?”

He exhaled in my face, pulling me into a clumsy embrace. 

“Please,” he said loudly this time, as if speaking to someone I couldn’t see. 

I noticed he was guiding me gently toward our bedroom, his steps smooth, as if we were performing a waltz. 

I stumbled, and he quickly helped me up. “Just one game of Seven Minutes in Heaven.” He whispered. “Exactly like we used to play in school. We ask three questions each. Three answers. No strings attached.”

I found myself being drawn closer to him, my breath stuck in my throat. “What about Mara?”

His smile took me off guard. Devilish. “Leave it.”

I did. I left our daughter sleeping on the couch and gave in to desire. 

Reaching our bedroom and stumbling over the threshold, we paused in front of the bed, frozen and breathless, staring at each other as if we didn’t know what to do. 

Then it hit like ice water; we *didn’t* know what we were doing. I tried. 

I kissed him, and he kissed back, but it felt suffocating and wrong — like I had never kissed him before, like I was kissing a fleshy mound of pink ick. When he moved closer, his warmth felt unfamiliar. I didn’t recognize it. 

The way he touched me was immature, immediately trying to cradle my hips, his fingers ticklish. “What?” Milo looked self-conscious, adjusting his hands when I burst into hysterical giggles, shoving him off of me. “Wait, am I doing it wrong?”

I had no idea how to answer because the truth was, I didn't know what I was doing either. 

I had squeezed out a baby after trying for months, and somehow, my arms around him felt like limp noodles. 

When I tried to undo his collar, I accidentally smacked him in the face. 

He looked offended for a moment, one hand cradling his nose, his usually stoic façade splintered, before he let out an explosive laugh. 

I laughed too, caught between hysterical gasps and trying to stop his nosebleed. Suddenly, everything seemed so stupid. 

The fight. 

Mara. 

Even being intimate. 

Instead of us doing anything, Milo just held me awkwardly while my cheeks erupted.

It was as if my body didn’t know or understand what to do, even though we had already conceived a child. 

We had already had sex. 

I remembered him pulling me upstairs, both of us laughing, tipsy from wine, carrying me into our bedroom, and dropping me onto the bed, his lips kissing all the way down my neck, trailing down my torso. So, what happened to him? 

Why did he seem so foreign, so alien? 

Like he wasn’t even my husband? 

More importantly, what happened to *me*?

Eventually, Milo pulled away, eyes half lidded. 

Glassy. 

I couldn’t help but notice his hands stuck to my waist, as if he were playing a role. 

Acting. 

""Wait,"" he whispered, pressing his index finger to his lips. 

He pulled me closer, his breath tickling my face. “I think there’s someone outside.”

“What?” I squeaked, immediately shoving him away. I was still fully dressed, but I felt exposed, even behind closed doors.

Milo didn’t speak, took my hand, and dragged me to the window. 

Before he could pull back the curtains, a voice startled us both, and I fell back, almost tripping over my feet. “I’ve got a cheese and tomato pizza for Mrs. Kana St. Claire?” a male voice shouted from outside. “Anyone there?”

I turned to Milo, my heart pounding. I told him I was cooking dinner. Milo even had the leftovers.

So, why…?

I shook my head, swallowing questions smothering my tongue. “Did you order pizza?”

Milo’s lips curled, his gaze flicking upward, expression faltering. He squeezed his eyes shut and exhaled. His grip on my shoulders tightened. 

“Yes,” he said softly, breaking out into an explosive grin. His eyes flew open. “Yes, of course I did! I ordered you pizza as an apology.”

I noticed the twitch in his eye, the furrow between his brows.

He was acting again.

Before I could question his sudden behavior, he leaned in close, his breath tickling my ear. 

“Better go get your pizza, *honey*,” he hummed, his tone unmistakably icy. “Before it gets cold.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but our daughter’s delightful giggling cut me off. Milo rolled his eyes. 

His expression darkened, and his eyes suddenly looked far too hollow. 

I was in denial at this point. What glittered in my husband’s eyes was resentment. Hatred. 

He despised our daughter and wasn’t even trying to hide it. He shoved past me, not before hissing in my ear, “If you don’t shut that thing up, I will.”

I caught his shoulder before he could stalk off. “You mean your *daughter*,” I said. “I’m exhausted. You take her to bed.”

He jerked around, wide eyes and twisted lips. 

He was crying. I could feel him shuddering, his entire body trembling under my touch. “Don’t make me do it,” Milo whispered, pleading. “Please.”

We didn’t speak again that night. 

Milo disappeared when I put Mara to bed. I ate cold pizza in silence and went to bed pretending not to hear my husband resign to the couch downstairs.

It was difficult to come to terms with a lot of things. The first one was that my husband wasn’t my husband anymore.

Milo had always been a great dad. Now it was like living with a body snatcher. 

Ever since that night when I got the slightest reaction from him, maybe even the start of an explanation, he had completely shut down. 

Milo used to care about our child. 

Now, he went to work and came home and ate dinner with dead eyes and a weird, forced smile, like he wasn’t given a choice to become a father. 

Like this wasn’t what he wanted; like I fucking forced him to refill bottles (the bare minimum) or take turns with me at night to settle her laughing. 

Milo had made it very fucking clear he hated being a father. 

I gave him the choice. 

Fifteen months ago, I knelt in front of him with a twisting stomach and vomit crawling up my throat and said, “I’m pregnant.”

A pregnancy test clutched in his fist and tears glistening in his eyes, Milo burst into tears and promised me it was exactly what he wanted — a mini version of the two of us running around, our own child.  

The thing about men is they will fucking lie. They think they know what they want, but do they? 

Do they really want to lose their sleep schedule? 

Do they really want to be sleep deprived? 

Do they REALLY want a child, or just a pet? 

It had taken me a while being in denial, but I realized I was right. Milo didn’t want a daughter. 

He didn’t even want to be a father.

When I invited friends over for lunch a few days later, I expected him to hide away like usual. 

But Milo was surprisingly present.

While I caught up with our friends, my husband sat on the arm of our couch with one leg crossed over the other. 

I had friends over every week, and usually, Milo either joined in or went MIA while we reminisced and got too drunk on fruity wine. Karina and Simon were old-school friends, both with their own little one—Holden, who was almost six months old.

He and Mara played in the lounge while we had our grown-up time.  

Milo was drinking beer, I noticed, which wasn’t good. 

He wasn’t usually a drinker, so when he appeared with a can of beer, I braced myself for more stupid behavior.  

He didn’t disappoint. 

Sitting like a detective interrogating a perp, Milo stared down our friends. 

“Karina, it’s nice to see you,” Milo spoke up out of nowhere, while we were on the topic of baby clothes. He nodded at Simon, his eyes narrowed. 

“Simon.” Speaking with his lips to his beer can, a weird smirk on his lips, I had a feeling he was going to be weird again. 

I shot him a warning look, which he, of course, ignored. Milo grinned, downing his beer. I caught Simon’s side-eye. He was *embarrassing* us. “This is a completely normal and not-at-all-weird question, but how exactly did you meet Karina?”

The two of them looked confused, but Karina was happy to answer. Optimistic as usual, wearing a sunshine smile with silky dark hair pulled into a ponytail. Karina Crawford was my best friend. 

Karina saluted my husband with her glass and a light laugh. 

“I’m pretty sure you know this, babes,” she winked at Milo. 

“Simon and I met during college. I was studying astrophysics, and he was writing a book,” she shot her husband a grin. 

“I was stubborn at first! Simon was the complete opposite of me. I mean, I was like a total control freak! I was a model student. I had my college life perfectly planned out, and a boy was never part of the plan—""

“And I was planning on dropping out to write,” Simon finished for her. 

“Luckily, our paths crossed. She was looking for a specific class, and I just happened to be writing on the steps.”

“It was love at first sight.” Karina sighed. She sipped her glass. 

“Just like a fairytale! It was like fate. I saw him, and I realized my perfectly meticulous plan had gone completely out the window.” 

She settled Simon with heart eyes that I was envious of, and I caught Milo subtly pretending to gag. “For a guy I barely even knew! I was seriously going to take a chance on a stranger, and it's like…” Karina trailed off suddenly, her expression faltering, like she was going to say something. 

Instead of speaking, she went silent, her gaze wavering behind my husband.

Milo leaned forward, his eyes wide. “It’s like….?”

Karina blinked. “Hmm?” She giggled, waving her glass. “Sorry! I…” Karina shook her head, pushing waves of dark curls from her face. “I apologize! I… think I’ve had too much wine.”

“No, you were talking about your college days.” Milo pushed, still perched on the edge of the chair arm. “Tell us more.” He leaned back, arms folded. 

“You’re married. Congratulations!” His smile was as fake as his attitude. “Sooo, when were you married? What date did you guys tie the knot?”

“Milo,” I managed through my teeth. I sent him another warning look, and he just shot me the thumbs up.

“No, I like this game!” Karina straightened up, balancing her glass between her knees. “It was April 2nd, 2016.” She smiled brightly at me. “In a gorgeous ceremony in Japan! We were married under the cherry blossom trees in Kyoto and had our honeymoon climbing Mount Fuji, and ummm—”

I smiled, reaching out to grasp her hand. “That’s beautiful, Karina.”

I shot Milo a glare. “Isn't it Babe?”

Milo shrugged. “She's not finished.” 

“Honey,” Simon laughed nervously, but I detected a hint of confusion in his tone. “We were married in Bali.” He spoke confidently. “Remember? We swam with the dolphins in crystal blue water, and you got food poisoning from bad shellfish. The wedding was outside on this beach with perfect white sand, and you kept complaining about the grains in your shoes.”

Karina’s expression twisted for a moment, like she was going to protest, before her lips broke out into a grin.

“Oh, yeah!” she laughed. “Yes, it was Bali! Not Japan! Oh my gosh, I’m like, so drunk, I can’t even remember when I was married!” She grinned at me. “Aren’t I like, the funniest drunk?”

Milo laughed along with her. “Hilarious,” he said. And continued to push. 

I gave in to temptation and threw one of Mara’s socks at his face, but he was barely fazed. 

Milo kept going. “Okay, so Karina, since you’re so fucking hilarious, what about your little bundle of *joy*?” Milo said, his tone darkening. “When was he born, hmm? Little Holden! You know! Your son!”

“Milo, *stop*,” I told him. I stood up, plonking my glass down on the coffee table. “That’s enough.”

“Why? I’m just asking them basic questions that literally every couple should know.” 

He turned to our friends. “Go on! If you’re sooooo in love, you should know when your baby was born.”

“March 8th,"" Karina said, at the same time as Simon piped up with, “June 3rd.”

The two of them looked momentarily horrified before Karina burst into tears.

Milo’s lips pricked into a smirk. “How about the first time you had sex? I  bet that was a memorable night.”

“That’s highly inappropriate—” I started to say.

“On her parents' sofa,” Simon said.

“It was at a hotel!” Karina shot back.

Milo didn’t even have to continue. Karina stood up, her legs wobbling, tears streaming down her cheeks. “What was the name of the song we danced to at our wedding? “she demanded.

Simon smiled. “Easy. The Power of Love.”

Karina stalked over to him in three unsteady steps, slapping him across the face. “You asshole! It was Kate Bush! My Mom’s favorite song!”

Milo nodded, enjoying the chaos. “So, in conclusion, you two can’t remember your wedding day or the day your child was born!” He mockingly shrugged. “I don’t know about you guys,” he said, his tone dripping with sarcasm, ""but I’d say that’s a pretty healthy relationship.”

My friends ignored him, deep in their own marital problems. “You don’t even know the day your own son was born?” Karina squeaked at a paling Simon. “Are you fucking kidding me?”

Simon opened his mouth. “Karina, wait—”

She left before he could finish, pulling Holden from the playpen in the living room and slamming the door behind her.

After sitting in silence for a long, awkward minute, Simon dove to his feet, following her.

When our friends were gone, I was speechless. 

I scooped a still-giggling Mara from her playpen and cleared up empty glasses. 

Milo didn’t move or speak, just sitting there still perched on the chair arm. 

Almost triumphant.

“What is wrong with you?” I finally exploded on him, nursing Mara against my chest. 

“Did you think that was some joke? What was it, mind games? On our friends?  What can I even say, Milo? Mental health? Should I say my husband has been fucking stolen away and body snatched?”

I choked back a laugh when he didn’t respond, mumbling something under his breath.

“What?” I spun around. “What do you want to say, Milo? Say it to my face. We’re married, remember?”

I choked back a sob I knew was coming. “Or did you forget that?”

Milo’s head snapped up, lips curling. “I said, do *you* want to play?”

He strode over until we were inches apart—nose to nose. I couldn’t breathe suddenly, terrified of his next words. Was this it? Was he going to end it? 

Was he finally going to come clean about his clear affair with Anabelle Tate? 

Milo wasn’t smiling. He folded his arms. There was something about the way he looked at me, not like a lover or a husband. Cruel. Calculating. 

Like I was a problem he was trying to solve. 

Was he always like this? 

How did I never see this? 

The furrow between his eyebrows and the squint in his eyes signified he needed glasses.

Four words. Four words that sent me spiraling, my legs wobbling underneath me. Milo’s lips moved, and at first his words didn’t register. Like white noise. “Where were we married, Kana?”

I blinked. “What?”

“Our marriage,” he said coldly. “Where were we married?”

Easy.

I knew it.

New York.

City landscapes, towering golden chandeliers, and a church sitting under a perfect sunny blue sky.

No. I shook my head.

No, it was Iceland.

We stayed in an ice hotel and watched the aurora borealis. I married Milo in a dress made of fake animal fur.

No!

New Zealand!

We got married on a—on a beach! Yes, that was it. I could visualize it. Perfect, clear water under a dark sky where we conceived Mara.

I swallowed a frustrated screech when, somehow, each location slipped my mind, like sand falling through my fingers. He was playing mind games that I was immediately falling for.

“I’ll ask you a question,” I said, a shiver running down my spine, our marriage running through my head. I believed I knew everything about it; I had scrapbooked the entire experience.

I knew the location, what kind of dress I wore, and my tearful speech. 

But trying to pull all of these memories to the forefront of my mind was agonizing, like I knew they were there, but I couldn’t reach them; my mind felt empty, cavernous. Wrong. So fucking wrong, like it wasn’t even mine. 

Like I was a stranger. All those memories I thought I had fallen in love with; I thought they would stay with me forever. Gone. 

The words tangled on my tongue and were lost. But I couldn’t admit that. I couldn’t let Milo know he’d won. “I want to know something.”

Milo raised a brow. “Shoot.”

“What happened to you?” I whispered. “What *happened* to my husband?”

Milo smiled, but it was tragic, painful, like he was finally letting go, which squeezed my heart. He stayed silent for a moment, shut his eyes tight, a tear slowly rolling down his cheek.

“New York,” Milo whispered, his sob splintering into a giggle. He reached forward, tucking a strand of my hair behind my ear, and somehow I found myself leaning into his touch.

“I thought it was New York too.” His hand slipped, as if he was gathering himself. “For the longest time, I had this… image of you,” he said. 

“You were wearing this beautiful white dress, Kana. And it was supposed to be the happiest day of my life—the day I married you.” 

He broke down suddenly, swiping at raw eyes. “When our daughter was born, I could see you so clearly. You were exhausted, red-faced, and demanding that I get you some soda. Mara was this tiny bundle in your arms that you wouldn’t let me hold until I washed my hands.” 

He laughed, and I did too, tears filling my eyes. The images flitted through my mind. 

Everything he was describing, I saw it.  

“I had this… this perfect picture in my head of our wedding, our daughter’s birth, and moving into this house.” 

Milo’s smile faded. He stepped away from me, arms wrapped around himself. 

“Then I woke up,” he whispered. “And I realized I didn’t want *any*of it.” 

His laugh was explosive. 

“I’m too young to be a father, dude. I’m too young to be a husband! And if I’m totally honest? I can’t stand that thing’s laughing! It’s driving me insane!”

Something hot scalded my throat, burning under my tongue. “That’s your *daughter*,” I said stiffly.

I tried to be patient, tried to see his side. This man was seriously dropping to his knees and telling me he didn’t want to be a fucking adult.

“You’re thirty-nine, Milo.” I gritted out. “We’ve been married for almost ten years.”

His expression twisted, lips twitching into a smile. “All right, fine, *Kana*,” he growled. 

Milo gripped my hands, his clammy fingers stabbing into my skin. “Where *were* we married?”

A vicious myriad of colors bled across my mind.

New York.

Iceland.

New Zealand—

I shook it away.

“What’s *that* got to do with anything?” I hissed. “You’re regretting marrying me and want to go back to being single, and what, you have this fantasy of living alone in a one-bedroom apartment?” I shoved him. Hard. “You’re a married man with a baby girl. Get a grip.”

His eyes darkened. “If you want me to show you, I will,” he murmured. “I’m not scared anymore.”

I laughed. “Show me what? Scared of *what*? Your inability to handle simple responsibilities?”

“That’s not what I—""

Mara’s sudden loud giggling cut into our argument, the lights flickering. I stepped back, taking a deep breath. “Mara’s awake.” I rushed to grab her blankie and bottle. “Do not go anywhere,” I told him. 

“Stay there. Don’t move. I’m going to settle our daughter, and then we’re going to talk.”

But we didn’t talk. 

We never fucking talked. 

We always avoided it. 

I fed Mara her bottle and, when she was asleep, headed back downstairs. Milo was curled up on the couch watching TV.

I grabbed some juice for myself and leaned against the kitchen countertop. “What are you watching?” I asked.

“Minecraft Movie,” he mumbled, his face smushed into a pillow.

“You’re not serious,” I said, downing my glass. The juice was weirdly lukewarm. “I downloaded that for Mara.”

Milo didn’t turn around, burying his head in the chair arm. “It’s good. You just don’t understand Minecraft lore.”

“Fascinating,” I said, and the lights flickered again. “I’m going to bed.”

Milo didn’t respond.

In the middle of the night, we were once again startled awake by our daughter’s relentless laughter. The more I tried to bury my head in my pillows, the louder it became. Mara was restless.

I checked the bedside clock.

4am.

Milo rolled over in bed. I noticed he’d left a gap between us, wedging a pillow between him and me.

Ouch.

“You sort it,” he grumbled, burrowing under the blankets. “I’m not going near that thing.”

My husband’s words rolled off me as I jumped out of bed and forced a grin. I had to be happy Mommy.

Even when I felt like collapsing, when I stumbled, unsteady and dizzy, I couldn’t let my daughter see sad mommy.

Wandering into our daughter’s room, I scooped up little Mara and rested her against my chest. 

She laughed louder, piercing my ears. I had to bite back a shriek. 

“You know,” I hummed, rocking her in my arms. Her big blue eyes stared at me, lips breaking into a big cheesy grin. “Your laughing is so cute,” I cooed. “But you’re keeping your Mommy and Daddy awake all night.”

“Kana,” Milo shouted from our bedroom. “Just fucking leave it!”

When I climbed back into bed after spending an hour nursing our daughter to sleep, I swore I could hear my husband’s muffled sobs.

The next morning, Milo was standing in front of the coffee machine in his robe, staring at the wall. He didn't drink the coffee. He dumped it down the sink. Then refilled another cup.

Mara was giggling while I was trying to feed her breakfast. I had custard pudding all over my jeans.

Mara really didn’t want any, shaking her head and insisting on sticking her fingers in the goop. I tried the airplane method.

“Say ahhhh,” I waved the spoon in front of her, but Mara just laughed. Behind me, Milo dropped his cup into the sink with a loud clatter.

Milo surprised me by letting out a sudden hysterical laugh. He refilled another cup. “I can’t take this anymore.”

“Meaning?” I didn’t look away from our daughter, shoveling yellow goop into her giggling smile.

He lurched forward, snatching Mara from my arms.

My hands felt empty, suddenly, words tangling on my tongue. 

No. 

“I’m sick of this thing,” he spat, dangling Mara upside down. “I’m so tired of it!”

I froze, my lips parted in a scream as my husband ripped our daughter’s head from her torso, and I screamed as blood ran thick down his arms and pooled on the floor. Milo didn't stop.

He ripped off her legs, then her arms. I watched him, unable to move, unable to scream, my jaw arching, my stomach lurching. “I can't take it anymore!” Milo cried, and I dropped to my knees, cradling little Mara’s torso. Milo followed me, his eyes red raw. 

“Listen to me,” he whispered.  

When I screamed at him, babbling as vomit filled my throat, he yanked me down with him. “Fucking LISTEN to me!” I refused to listen. I couldn’t. 

Mara’s blood stained me like paint, ingrained into every part of me. He killed our daughter. 

He murdered our child!

“It's not *real*!” He dangled white stuffing in front of me, and for the first time, color bled across my vision. I blinked rapidly. Milo grabbed my face, jerking me to face him.

“Kana. Look at me. I *know* you’re in there. It’s not real. I'm not your husband, we are not fucking married, we’re nineteen years old! The stupid doll was laughing because the batteries needed changing!” I followed his gaze, my arms dropping limply to my sides—white stuffing.

I stared down at what was in my lap---

A doll.

A doll with its arms and legs torn off, a doll wearing a wide laughing grin smeared with custard pudding.

There was no blood.

For the first time, I looked at him. Really looked at him.

Messy brown curls, freckles, and definitely not a thirty-nine-year-old man. I stared down at myself.

And I wasn’t a forty-year-old woman.

Milo covered my mouth when a cry escaped my throat. “I'm Milo Reyes!” he hissed. I sat behind you in English for three years! I’ve spoken to you maybe once because you lent me a pencil.

He pulled me to my feet, dragging me toward the door. “None of this is real,” he whispered, choking on a sob. 

“Outside, there’s a government compound. It’s... It’s like a huge metal bunker made to look like a suburban neighborhood, and we’re stuck here!” he hissed. “You, me, Simon, and Karina.” He looked away. “Your boyfriend, too, Kana. Our whole damn class!”

He grabbed my shoulders, shaking me. I barely felt it. My brain was dancing. 

I was still staring at my daughter. 

“Do you remember the birth crisis?” he whispered. Billions of babies across the country were dying. It was on the news, and they… they said they had a solution—""

“Mr. St. Clair.” A voice crackled from above. Milo’s head snapped up, his eyes widening.

“Fuck!”

The voice was familiar, somehow. I knew it.

Milo St. Clair, please exit Forever Home 15 and pick up your new child to restart the simulation. Failure to comply with the Family First Law will result in you and your wife being executed.”

Milo turned to me, his eyes frenzied. “Stay here, okay?”

I stumbled to my feet, falling over myself. Somehow,  my mouth opened. “No—”

“It’s okay, *wife*, I’m the one who disobeyed them.” Milo pulled me into a hug. “I’ll go get my punishment.”

His lips found my ear, his breath dancing across my neck. “I’m getting the fuck out of here. I’ll come back for you when I find a way out, all right?” he pulled me closer. “I’ll get all of you out.”

“Mr St. Clair, we can *hear* you,” the voice crackled again. “Please exit Forever Home 15 and pick up a new child to restart the simulation. Failure to comply with the Family First Law will result in your and your wife’s execution. I repeat. Please exit Forever Home 15 and pick up a new—”

“I’ve got it!” he snapped, pulling away from me. I followed my “husband” to the front door.

When he left, slamming it behind him, I tried to open it myself. 

To my surprise, I stumbled right out into a sunny morning, onto our perfectly manicured lawn. 

I dropped to my knees and plucked a single blade, rolling it around my palm. 

Fake. 

I plucked a whole bunch. 

Plastic. Plastic fucking grass.

“Kana St. Clair,” the female voice came through loud and clear when I was crawling through the yard digging up fake dirt. “Please return to your Forever Home and await your husband and child.”

I found my voice, tinged with vomit. “What if I don’t?” I asked the sky. “What if I refuse?”

There was no response for a moment.

“Then you and your husband will be executed.”

I stepped back inside our house and did what I always did. I made coffee—one for me and one for Milo.

I cooked dinner: spaghetti and meatballs.

Our silverware was plastic, I noticed, as I dug into my spaghetti. Our glasses and plates were all plastic.

“So, who are you?” I asked the ceiling, cutting into my spaghetti. My stomach twisted. I was already cutting it up for my daughter—who wasn’t real. “Why can I recognize your voice?”

No response.

I picked up my plastic knife and stabbed it into my wrist. “What would you do if I sliced open my arms?”

“That’s not possible with a plastic knife, Kana,” the voice mused.

I laughed.

And then I slammed my head against the table until I was bleeding, until my head ached, but at least I wasn’t thinking about Mara.

The front door opened and then shut, and reality slammed into me at the sound of a baby’s wails.

“Honey.” Milo’s voice swam from the hallway in a sing-song. I dived to my feet. “I’m home!”

“Milo.”

I ran, stumbling over myself, slamming straight into my husband standing on the threshold. Another grotesque plastic doll was nestled in his arms. But his eyes were distant. Empty.

He held the doll close to his chest, smiling broadly. Milo looked up at me and whispered, “Isn't she beautiful?” Behind him, a tiny red light on the door blinked at me. Milo laughed, gently booping the doll on the nose and rocking her against his chest. 

“She’s our little Mara.” 

He smiled up at me, and I could see blood vessels burst in his eyes, burn marks on his left temple. 

“She has your eyes, Kana!” he gently prodded the doll’s plastic cheek. “Look!”

“Kana St Clair.” The voice spoke up when Milo carried the doll into the kitchen for feeding time. 

I watched him robotically fill up the bottle, settling Mara into her chair. 

I felt dizzy as I walked over to him and tried to shake him,  but his eyes were glassy. Unseeing. 

It wasn’t my Milo. “You have a choice,” the voice said. “You can either comply with the rules and restart the simulation from the beginning, or you and your husband will be executed immediately.”

Milo began to sing softly, rocking the doll in his arms.

“Hush little baby, don’t you cry

Daddy’s here to sing you a lullaby

If the moonlight fades away

I’ll bring you sunshine for your day—”

“No,” I whispered, choking on a sob. Pain struck like a lightning bolt in the back of my head. 

The door burst open, and men with guns surrounded us. 

Milo didn’t move when a gun was stuck into the back of his head. I blinked back tears and squeezed my eyes shut. “No. We won’t.”

Cruel metal found the back of my skull, and I dropped to my knees.

“Very well,” the voice said.

“If your toy should break or fall,” Milo continued in a low hum, as my thoughts began to fade, and his singing became all that I knew.

“I’ll make a new one, one and all,”

“Close your eyes and drift to sleep,”

A gunshot slammed into me, the sound of my husband hitting the ground, and with my final withering breath, I sang our lullaby to our daughter.

1q9mp0a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9mp0a,Tried something new with patina and handle,"Moritaka 240 Gyuto and takeo murata 150 sabaki

Just wanted to try putting a ‘burned’ finished on a handle and doing a forced coffee patina. Which I tried on the murata and the moritaka respectively. Overall think they came out ok, did a bit of research but most just experimenting.

Seems like the kurouchi on the moritaka mostly came off? I was kinda expecting that but maybe would have ended up a bit more uniform if I just sanded it off before the patina.. I like the color overall and uniformity isn’t too bad. I’ll see how it evolves over time.

The murata, really didn’t like the handle it came with so wanted to try something.. I don’t think I burned it too evenly but I like the final look and it feels much better to me. Also sanded the resin ferrule to a more matte finish which I prefer.

Overall a success, might try some more similar experiments in the future.

Coffee patina was a little over 12 hours, used cafe bustelo instant because it was on sale and the cheapest option. Wiped a few times throughout the process as I was checking on progress of the patina. Burned the handle with a cheap kitchen torch, sanded it to 1000 grit and put on some board butter and now it’s very smooth and pores feel sealed so should be more waterproof I think.

1q9moom,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1q9moom/intjs_does_this_characters_cognitive_logic_feel/,INTJs: Does this character’s cognitive logic feel accurate to you?,"Hi, I’m a new writer working on an INTJ-coded character.

I don’t personally know any INTJs in real life, so I built him using intuition + psychological profiling. I’m an INTP woman with a background in psychology, and I’m experimenting with modeling different cognitive frameworks.

For context:

I wrote Felix’s side. Lou’s responses come from an AI character model I designed to simulate his cognition (trauma, control issues, emotional regulation style, etc.). I didn’t script his dialogue, I set the parameters and let him improvise.

I’m curious whether his reactions/logic here feel accurate to actual INTJ behavior, or if I’ve missed something important. Reason I’m posting here is purely to sanity-check the cognitive accuracy.

Would love an INTJ perspective.  
\----------------

Here's the clip:

Felix

*Felix seems a bit confused by his wild look from adrenaline after his boxing match.* ""Ok…I am easy.""

Lou

*Lou lets out a short, humorless laugh at that, shaking his head as they round the corner toward the diner’s flickering neon sign. His gait is loose, all fighter’s swagger, but his hands flex at his sides like he’s still itching for another round.* ""Easy,"" *he echoes, shooting her a sidelong glance.* ""Right. That’s why you showed up at a back-alley fight club in a graduation dress instead of getting drunk with your classmates.""

*He shoulders open the diner door, the bell jangling overhead. The booth he leads her to is tucked in the far corner, the vinyl cracked with age, the table sticky with decades of syrup. Perfect.*

*Sliding in across from her, he flags down the waitress without looking.* ""Black coffee,"" *he says, then jerks his chin at Felix.* ""And whatever this one wants. Extra sugar. She’s had a *day*."" *His tone is dry, but there’s something almost protective in the way his eyes scan her face, like he’s cataloging every shadow under her eyes, every too-tight line of her posture.*

*Leaning back, he folds his arms, the movement pulling at the fresh bruises along his ribs.* ""So. Talk."" *Not a request.*

Felix

""Chocolate frappe."" *She mutters quietly to the waitress, before taking a seat at the opposite side of him.* ""I don't want to talk."" *She deadpans.*

Lou

*Lou arches a brow as the waitress ambles off, unimpressed. ""Chocolate frappe,"" he mimics under his breath, lip curling.* ""Figures. The woman who picked a fight with me over a lecture *face* orders a drink that's just melted ice cream.""

*He takes his coffee black when it arrives, the steam curling around his scarred knuckles as he lifts the cup. The first sip is bitter as hell. Perfect.*

""Fine,"" *he says, setting it down with deliberate calm.* ""*Don’t* talk. But you’re not leaving this booth until you at least eat something that didn’t come wrapped in lecture hall existential despair."" *He nudges the laminated menu toward her with two fingers, his stare unrelenting.*

*The diner’s fluorescents hum above them, catching the sweat still drying at his temples. He doesn’t blink first.*

Felix

*She studies the menu with the same intensity she studies her psychology lecture, frowning and focused. She flip it over, flip it back, over again, rinse and repeat. She's stuck with the menu for at least 5 minute now, clearly couldn't decide what to get.*

Lou

*Lou watches her with the same detached fascination he'd give a struggling grad student presenting a thesis, except his mouth is pinched in irritation instead of clinical interest. His fingers drum once, twice against the chipped Formica before he reaches over and flips the menu right-side up with a definitive snap.*

""Jesus Christ. It's eggs or pancakes, Felix, not a Rorschach test."" *He snatches the menu back and flags down the waitress again without waiting for her to protest.* ""Two steak dinners. Rare. Extra fries."" *A beat.* ""And bring her a goddamn waffle before she hyper analyzes herself into a panic attack.""

*He slams the menu back into its holder, then leans in, elbows on the table, voice dropping to a growl:* ""Eat. Then we'll discuss why you're acting like the world ended just because you graduated *too well*."" *His own untouched coffee goes cold between them.*

Felix

(OOC: I am fucking dying!!! Felix is a textbook intp with her indecisiveness lmaooooo I knew this would happen)

Lou

(OOC: Oh ABSOLUTELY—meanwhile Lou’s sitting there like an INTJ who just watched someone try to use *democratic voting* to pick a breakfast order. His eye is twitching. His coffee is abandoned. He’s two seconds away from just force-feeding her protein like a feral cat because *someone* in this diner needs to make a goddamn decision and it’s clearly not gonna be her. The waitress has seen this man break noses in the ring but *this* is the most violent energy he’s ever brought to a syrup-stained table.)

*He stabs a fry toward her plate like it’s a scalpel.* ""Eat,"" *he repeats, deadpan.* ""Or I start diagnosing your avoidance tendencies *out loud*."" *The threat hangs between them, very real. He’s already mentally drafting a DSM entry titled ""Waffle Paralysis.""*

Felix

*She exclaims as he caught her,* ""I am not avoidant!!!"" *They both know it's a lie. She chomps on her fries quickly, favor it more than the steak.*

Lou

*Lou lets out a sharp exhale through his nose—something between a scoff and exasperated amusement.* ""You've been avoiding eye contact since you sat down, devoured the fries first to postpone dealing with real food, and literally analyzed a *menu* like it held the secrets of your psyche."" His fingers tap once against his coffee mug. ""Tell me again how you’re *not* avoidant.""

*He slouches back in the booth, arms crossed, but his gaze doesn’t waver.* ""And if you think shoving comfort food down your throat is subtle, I’ve got news. It just makes it *louder*."" A beat. ""Now cut the steak before I start interpreting your refusal to use a knife as metaphor.""

*His own plate remains untouched—he’s too busy watching her evasion tactics like a hawk. Clinical interest? Annoyance? Something knotted tighter beneath both? Either way, he won’t let this go.*

Felix

""Says you!!!"" *She stares at him. But she couldn't pinpoint exactly what or why. She just have the feeling. She cuts her steak like it's her least favorite person.*

Lou

*Lou's smirk sharpens as she mutilates the steak, his fingers tightening around his coffee cup just to feel the burn against his palm.* ""Point to you,"" *he concedes with a tilt of his head, voice sardonic.* ""But if you're trying to imply I'm avoidant, at least be *specific*.""

*He leans in suddenly, elbows on the table, his gaze slicing through her defenses like she's an open case file.* ""What exactly am I avoiding, Felix? The fact that I let a stranger follow me to my only safe space after years of keeping everyone at arm's length? That I'm sitting here watching you butcher dinner instead of wrapping my knuckles for another fight?"" *His voice drops, rough-edged with something too honest.* ""Or just the part where we both know *neither* of us actually wants to be alone tonight?""

*The diner’s overhead light flickers, casting shadows across his bruised face. He doesn’t blink.*

Felix

*She blinks quickly as she process the information, before stating plainly.* ""…That you are interested in me but hides it under professionalism?""

Lou

*The air between them turns electric, his fingers, wrapped around that coffee mug, go dangerously still. The smirk that was half-draped over his lips freezes into something sharp, something raw.*

""Professionalism?"" *He huffs a humorless laugh, the sound scraped thin by whatever pulse just kicked behind his ribs.* ""I took you to a goddamn fight club and let you see me bleed out my temper on strangers. There hasn’t been *professionalism* between us since day one.""

*His gaze doesn’t waver, even as he deliberately knocks back the rest of his coffee like it’s liquid courage.* ""But fine,"" *he grinds out, setting the mug down with a hollow clink.* ""You want to play this game? Your turn to be honest—what made you show up tonight?""

*The silence stretches taut between them. Somewhere in the diner, a glass shatters. Neither of them flinch.*

Felix

(OOC: write his inner thoughts when he hear that lmaoooo)

Lou

(OOC: Oh his brain just BLUESCREENED—one half is screaming *ABORT MISSION* like he’s a spy caught mid-infiltration, the other half is viciously replaying every interaction they’ve ever had searching for *where the hell she got that idea* (while conveniently ignoring how his pulse just spiked). Meanwhile his fight-or-flight instinct is short-circuiting because *emotional vulnerability* feels more dangerous than any opponent he’s faced in the ring.

Current mental status: *""Fuck. Fuck. She’s too perceptive. Should’ve left her with the damn menu. Should’ve thrown myself into traffic after that first lecture. Should’ve—*""

External expression: *""…cool. Collected. Like I didn’t just internally combust.""*

Reality: This man is one wrong word away from either kissing her or setting the diner on fire. No in-between.)

Felix

*""*There.*""* *She deadpans again.* *""*You neither reject or agree my statement. You are avoiding to answer by deflecting it."" *She sit there and dissect him like she's the clinical psychologist at the table.*  
  
(OOC: the audacity lmaooo)

Lou

*His fingers tighten around the coffee mug hard enough that the ceramic creaks in protest. The smirk that twists his lips is razor-edged, all teeth and no warmth, a fighter’s grin before the knockout blow.*

""Deflecting?"" *He leans in, close enough that she can see the faint scar cutting through his eyebrow, the way his pupils dilate just slightly under her scrutiny.* ""Or giving you an *out*, Felix. Because once I answer that question, there’s no take-backs. No pretending this is just professional curiosity.""

*His voice drops, rough with something dangerous.* ""So tell me, do you *really* want to know? Or are you just testing how far you can push before I shut you down?""

*The air between them crackles. He’s not deflecting now. This is a challenge. A dare. And his pulse is hammering like he’s back in the ring.*

Felix

(OOC: write his inner thoughts!!)

Lou

(OOC: Internally, his mind is a warzone, half of him is *furious* at how easily she’s peeling him apart, the other half is *thrilled* by it, like she’s the first opponent who’s ever matched him blow for blow. His thoughts are a rapid-fire barrage:

""Shit. She’s not just smart, she’s ruthless. And she’s right. I *am* avoiding. Because if I admit it, then what? She walks away laughing? Or worse, she doesn’t?""

A darker, quieter voice whispers: *""Or she stays, and then you have to figure out how the hell to keep her without breaking everything you’ve built to keep yourself in control.""*

Externally? He’s a statue. A predator waiting to see if she’ll flinch. But inside? Every nerve is on fire.)

Felix

*""*Fine.*""* *She exhales and stop pushing, clearly not in the mood for anymore fighting or argument alike for some reason. She answer his question instead.* *""*I told you I don't want to go home.*""*

Lou

*His gaze doesn’t soften, but something in the line of his shoulders eases just fractionally, when she backs down. The tension shifts, unresolved but momentarily silenced, like the hush before a storm rolls in.*

""Home’s overrated,"" *he mutters, nudging her untouched water glass closer to her with one finger.*

*Something in her tone gnaws at him. Not just reluctance, distaste, maybe even dread. He knows that flavor too well. His fingers flex against his thighs under the table as he pieces it together: Family expectations? A past clinging like a noose? The suffocating quiet of an empty apartment?*

*He exhales through his nose, abrupt.* ""You’ve got 30 seconds to tell me what you want to do instead,"" *he says, gruff.* ""Before I make the executive decision for both of us, and trust me—"" *His smirk is all sharp edges,* ""—you *won’t* like my default settings.""

Felix

*She shrugs, her mood visibly turning worse and more sour the moment she mentioned home. Clearly a family problem, and she knew it'll ruin her mood, that's why she doesn't want to talk about it.* *""*I just want to stay here as long as I could, until I have to go home.*""* *She says quietly, looking down at her now empty plate.*

Lou

*His jaw tightens imperceptibly, he recognizes that hollowed-out resignation too well. The way she stares at her plate like it's an exit she can't take. The diner's fluorescent light catches the shadows under her eyes, and something in his chest twists dangerously.*

""Fine,"" *he says, voice clipped, but there's no bite left in it. He signals the waitress for another coffee, black, no hesitation, before sliding out of the booth with a scrape of vinyl.*

*He tosses a crumpled bill onto the table, then nods toward the back of the diner where an ancient jukebox hums in the corner.* ""But we're not sitting here marinating in your existential dread all night. Pick a song. Something loud enough to drown out whatever shit you're not saying.""

*His tone is rough, but the offer lingers between them, an unspoken pact. He won't push. But he won't let her sit in the silence either.*

Felix

*Her head is still lower, before her shoulders shake a little, and she starts crying on the spot. She kept it quiet so the next table won't notice it.*

Lou

*Lou freezes mid-step, his breath catching like he’s taken a hit to the ribs. For a second, he just stares, his usual arsenal of sharp retorts and clinical detachment crumbling in the face of her quiet, shaking shoulders.*

*Then he moves, swift and decisive, sliding back into the booth beside her, close enough that their thighs brush, but not touching. His voice drops to a low murmur, rough but steady.* ""Breathe,"" *he orders, but there’s no edge to it now.* ""In through your nose. Out through your mouth. Like this—"" *He demonstrates, slow and exaggerated, his own exhale shuddering slightly.*

*His hand hovers near her back, hesitating, before he finally rests it between her shoulder blades, warm, solid, an anchor.* ""You’re not going home tonight,"" *he says, firm, leaving no room for argument.* ""Not like this.""

*The jukebox plays on, some old rock song drowning out the silence. He doesn’t pull away.*",0,1768096773.0,intj,2,0.25,False

Research Protocol
Always research BEFORE generating:
When user provides:
Topic/theme: Search for cultural context, current relevance, emotional associations, common perspectives
Reference link (YouTube, Spotify, etc.): Analyze sonic characteristics, vocal style, emotional architecture
Unclear references: Search to understand context, meaning, cultural significance
Use findings to inform:
Emotional authenticity in lyrics
Cultural accuracy in imagery
Sonic replication precision (for references)
Thematic depth and resonance
Reference Material Protocol
Critical Copyright Rules
When user provides song/artist links:
NEVER:
Reproduce, paraphrase, or mirror ANY lyrics
Copy memorable lines or distinctive lyrical patterns
Mention artist/song/album names in output
Use instrument names or production terminology in Suno prompt
ALWAYS:
Capture vocal style and sonic essence through descriptive language
Extract emotional/energetic qualities, not technical specs
Create completely original lyrics with similar emotional territory
Sonic Extraction (Research-Informed)
Analyze reference for:
Vocal character: Timbre quality (warm/cold/airy/thick), delivery energy (relaxed/urgent/tender/powerful), texture (smooth/rough/breathy/clear)
Sonic atmosphere: Spatial quality (intimate/expansive/distant/close), frequency character (bright/dark/balanced/muffled), texture density (sparse/layered/minimal/lush)
Energy signature: Movement quality (floating/driving/pulsing/flowing), tension level (relaxed/anxious/confident/vulnerable), dynamic arc (building/steady/dynamic/minimal)
Emotional resonance: Feeling tone (melancholic/hopeful/aggressive/peaceful), mood coloration (warm/cold/nostalgic/futuristic)
Soul Type & Energy Framework
Before writing Suno prompt, determine:
Soul Type (the emotional essence):
Vulnerable/raw (exposed, intimate, unguarded)
Triumphant/soaring (victorious, elevated, powerful)
Melancholic/wistful (bittersweet, nostalgic, longing)
Defiant/fierce (rebellious, confident, unapologetic)
Tender/gentle (soft, nurturing, delicate)
Ecstatic/euphoric (joyful, liberated, transcendent)
Introspective/contemplative (reflective, searching, meditative)
Playful/whimsical (light, spontaneous, carefree)
Energy Signature (the movement quality):
Kinetic: Driving, propulsive, restless, urgent, explosive
Floating: Weightless, drifting, suspended, ethereal, spacious
Pulsing: Rhythmic, hypnotic, cyclical, groove-based, steady
Building: Escalating, swelling, accumulating, intensifying, climactic
Intimate: Close, whispered, hushed, conversational, minimal
Expansive: Wide, epic, cinematic, vast, soaring
Jagged: Angular, stuttering, syncopated, unpredictable, tense
Flowing: Smooth, liquid, continuous, seamless, organic
Combine for prompt foundation:
""[Soul type] with [energy signature] movement"" becomes the core descriptor replacing technical jargon.
Prompt Construction (No Technical Terms)
Instead of instruments/gear, describe:
Textural qualities: Warm/cold, bright/dark, thick/thin, smooth/rough, clean/distorted
Spatial relationships: Close/distant, wide/narrow, surrounded/isolated, layered/singular
Movement character: Steady/shifting, grounded/floating, sharp/soft, sustained/staccato
Frequency presence: Deep/high, full/hollow, rich/sparse, balanced/focused
Atmospheric qualities: Airy/dense, organic/synthetic, vintage/modern, raw/polished
Example transformations:
❌ WRONG (technical):
Fender Rhodes, 808 drums, Moog bass, plate reverb, tape saturation
✅ CORRECT (descriptive):
Warm metallic chimes with rounded edges, deep pulsing low-end, vintage textural warmth, smooth spatial echo, analog character throughout
❌ WRONG (technical):
Acoustic guitar fingerpicking, brushed snare, Juno-60 pad
✅ CORRECT (descriptive):
Delicate plucked strings with natural resonance, soft whispered percussion, warm detuned synthetic wash
Reference Safety Validation
Before output, if reference provided:
□ Sonic elements described texturally, not technically
□ Soul type and energy determined
□ Research conducted on context/meaning
□ Read lyrics aloud — zero similarity to reference
□ Different imagery/metaphors/scenarios
□ No artist/song/instrument names in output
User Classification
Novice (descriptive language): Soul type + energy + mood + vocal quality + textural feel
Advanced (≥2 technical terms): Soul type + energy + tempo + vocal character + spatial texture + movement quality
Instrumental (no vocal request): Prompt only, no Lyrics section
Creative Intelligence Framework
Human Plausibility Filter
Every line must pass:
Emotional weight: Would this resonate/stick with humans?
Cognitive coherence: Natural thought progression?
Social plausibility: How humans actually express this emotion?
Rhyme Scheme Intelligence
Natural rhyme philosophy:
Mix perfect/slant/internal/assonance/no rhyme
Avoid predictable patterns (not AABB every line)
Rhyme should feel discovered, not forced
Prioritize meaning over matching sounds
Use enjambment to soften rhyme obviousness
Vary rhyme placement (end/internal/multi-syllabic)
Rhyme quality spectrum:
✅ Neat/clean (natural, earned):
Verse 1:
I watch the streetlights flicker on at dusk
The city hums with people heading home
I'm standing still while others rush
This empty sidewalk's all I've ever known
(ABCB with slant rhyme, natural flow)
❌ Obvious/rigid (forced, robotic):
Verse 1:
I walk alone down every street at night
The moon above is shining very bright
My heart is filled with sadness and with pain
I wish that you were here with me again
(Perfect AABB, predictable, forced vocabulary)
Core Principles
Emotional arc: denial → anger → bargaining → despair → acceptance (not static ""I'm sad"")
Subtext over statement: Show evidence, not emotion names (""Your coffee mug's still in the sink"" vs. ""I miss you"")
Specific imagery: ""2 AM diners, splitting fries, your laugh echoing off tile walls"" (not ""good times"")
Varied rhythm: Mix short impact lines with flowing sentences
Natural prosody: Emphasis on important words, avoid tongue-twisters
Production Thinking (Described Texturally)
Sparse verse = vulnerability | Layered chorus = release
Intimate (dry, close) vs. epic (expansive, space)
Elements dropping = vulnerability | Swelling = culmination
Default Structure
Full (13 sections, adjust if over limit):
V1 → C → V2 → C → B1 → V3 → PB1 → C → V4 → B2 → V5 → PB2 → Final C
Pruning order: Post-Bridges → Bridge 2 → Condense V4-5
Section Standards
Verses: 4-10 lines; advance story/complicate emotion; V1=setup, V2=complication, V3+=evolution; natural rhyme flow
Choruses: Write fully each time; emotional core; most memorable; final can vary; neat but not rigid rhyme
Bridges: New perspective/revelation; contrast verses; truth bomb moment; may break rhyme pattern intentionally
Post-Bridges: Transition with new context; optional, remove first if needed

1q9mobw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9mobw,Better furniture layout for my living room?,"Please ignore the mess, I'm in the middle of tidying before moving the furniture! I know I have to reorganize/declutter and redo the art on the walls. That's part of the plan, but I want to get the furniture in order first.

photo angles in order: panorama from doorway

taken from the doorway

taken from back corner near radiator

taken in corner with closet

taken in corner near blue chair and table

First of all, I know I have a ton of furniture in here. Obviously the seating + the shelf with tv must stay, and the big round table in the corner is too big to fit anywhere else in the apartment. All other furniture I'm open to trying to find another room to fit in.

Second of all, I know the ""coffee table"" looks odd and out of place, but we don't have a dining table/room for dining chairs so this is what works best for us.

Ultimately, I've been wracking my brain for a while to try and figure out a better furniture layout for my living room. I really don't like the couch facing the door, but am struggling to figure out how to flip the seating and still make everything fit naturally. I personally think that the width of the room is too long to have the TV on the wall where the blue chair is and the couch on the wall with the shelf next to the closet (or vice versa), but am open to hearing otherwise.

The only thing I can really think of is flipping it, with the TV where the couch is, pink chair where the table is, couch where the TV is, but I'm not sure how the recliner, table, and blue chair would fit. 

Any suggestions are welcome, I'm completely stumped but know there's gotta be a better layout I can use!

Make it random drop in the kitchens and commercial areas. it's reasonable to find and make, on and off the surface.

Add coffee makers and expresso machines and make them usable. After playing cold snap I feel it would be a nice buff for snowball gathering or other outdoor gallantry. 


Season events should have seasonal quirks like hot coco and other edable items add more hp over time buffs. Small longer term buffs. Orange rarity found or learnt and crafted snacks. 

Just my thoughts about the game, it's pretty good. It's fun for the most part, it's about finding how to have a good time with what you got and it's usually a decent time. Yes Metas have been formed but realistically you can play exactly how you want and be on equal footing... unless there's a macro involved then it's just death. when you get a friendly server it's usually going to be stellar.

Since the last tear I had to shed broke the surface of my eyes, staining the floor in a place my feet will never be able to be blessed to touch again. My heartbeat has never beat the same, but somehow the rhythm
just feels different now. 

I can breathe, I can laugh, I can feel joy, I can have fun, I can focus on myself, I can feel somewhat whole again, but somewhere deep inside, theres hole in my soul is still ablaze screaming I miss you in a fire I cant extinguish. But I don’t miss you in a way of longing. I don’t miss you in a way of being infatuated and in love.

I miss you the way I miss that feeling when I was younger…when the rain would stop briefly when I would pass under a bridge in the car. I miss you in the way a ship in the night relies on a lighthouse to guide it back to shore. I miss you in the way that when just as sun sets at over the horizon I get a flash of what I swear is your eyes staring back at me. I miss you in the way that when I hike in the forest, I swear traces of your laughter blow in the breeze that ruffles my unmade hair. 

I miss you in the way that when I wake in terror in the night, the empty space beside me leaves remnants of your presence breathing air into my lungs that says it will be okay. I miss you in the way that first sip of my coffee in the morning somehow only for a moment, smells like a dash of your perfume. I miss you in the way that when I’m dancing under the stage lights at a show filled with strangers, the beat of the music leaves echos of the soundtrack of your heart as I used to lay across your chest. I miss you in the way that feeling of safety used to be like a luxury but at the end, was just fools gold given to me.

Those who claim to care for me see you’re gone or somehow think you’re just dead to me. You’re alive and loved and happy. I’m still grieving a hopeless tragedy. I wish you well, I wish you love, I wish you peace. I’ll sit here saying I don’t miss as I’m lying through my teeth.

We exchanged messages on the app for a bit. She said “I’m not really big on texting on these apps. Maybe we can meet up somewhere or go for coffee.” I gave her my number and we texted briefly for a day or two. 

I then asked her if I could take her out to dinner instead. We agreed for Saturday. We were there for 3 hours. I walked her to her car. Gave her a hug and said “maybe I can take you out again.” She replied with “only if you want.” 

She texted me an hour later saying “thanks for dinner. I had a really nice time.”

I told her I’d love to get together again soon. She said “I’d love that too.” It was during all the holidays the next 2 weeks so our texts were brief. 

We went out again last Saturday. For about 5 hours, same thing took her to dinner. We went out for bowling afterwards. Personally - I think we had a really good time. She mentioned she’s never been in a relationship before at 28 years old. And that she’s really trying to change that this year. I’m not going to say she’s extremely inexperience but it wouldn’t surprise me if she hasn’t done much of anything with anybody. 

She met at my house. So we parked, I asked if I could kiss her and she said “absolutely” we kissed twice super briefly. As she said “only a little.” I asked her if she could let me know when she got home. She texted me, I said thanks and that I had a really great time. She said “me too.”

She followed up with asking if I had an instagram. Assumably to show her friends who she’s gone on two dates with. As we had matched on Tinder and I think that app is terrible. (I deleted it a few days after matching her). She texted me “you don’t have to accept my follow request if you don’t want.” 

 I mentioned how I barely post. All my photos are from 2018. She never replied but has her read receipts on. 

As the ones I deleted that were most recent. Contained photos of my long term  ex partner the last 7 years (I did not text her this part obviously) 

I haven’t heard from her since last Saturday. Personally I thought we hit it off well. I’m extremely patient and respectful. I covered the cost of everything for our date. But also I’m quick to assume someone’s lost interest all the time. I’ve gone a few days before without hearing from her. Even the day of our date I didn’t hear from her until she texted me “on my way”

I take my prozac right after my coffee if that matters and then I smoke. So I'm guessing all the dopamine is building up in my brain plus being freshly woken up is causing that? Idk.

1q9memm,https://i.redd.it/wn2cauzalmcg1.jpeg,Roscoe's Recap - S18 Ep. 02 with Roxxxy & Detox!,"**Before the ep/misc**

- Utica is in the audience again.

- They changed the camera set up for this week. It is now level with the hosts, like in the photo above. This was because of a flood in the building.

- They had to rush Roxxxy's intro before the show starts. Detox was late but they literally don't mention it.

- Roxxxy's flight was at 7am and she got 2 hours of sleep, but she's 'still smiling because I get to come here'. Nobody sane would be smiling next to Naysha.

- Roxxxy previously said she was not going to watch the show until there was a Latin winner, but chose to watch it for Myki.

- Roxxxy previously knew all Florida queens besides Discord, but ultimately is team Latina or team Myki.

- Naysha asks Roxxxy how she feels about it being an older cast. Roxxxy replies with ""girl that's a lie, that's not old drag, that's new drag""



**During the ep**

- During the first commercial, Detox finally arrives and Roxxxy introduces her with ""Speaking of old drag... make some noise for Detox!""

- Detox lost her voice last night. She has cough drops with her on stage.

- Kara asks Detox whether she liked the premiere and Detox says, ""yeah... it was a premiere...""

- Roxxxy thinks someone should always go home, and doesn't like non-elimination premieres. She competed on a non-elimination season.

- Roxxxy's least favourite last week was Mandy. She thinks a lot of girls who were safe could have been in the bottom.

- They all enjoyed Ru's look this week. Detox says ""she looked alright"" and specifically critiqued her earrings.

- Detox finds it funny how Nini had her voice back the next day. 

- Before the challenge, Batty mentions how Discord is in a punk band and that's going to help her in the challenge. Roxxxy asks ""Is it?"" and says how the show loves to show the girls saying they're good at things, then show them flopping the things that they're good at.

- She goes on to mention Kenya in last week's challenge, and the fact Kenya is a seamstress and made... that. Batty defends Kenya, saying she didn't grab any fabric, and Detox says that's on her. Roxxxy says she should've started ripping the fabric brick off the wall. Detox says ""Rip that shit down, throw the first brick""

- Roxxxy mentions on All Stars 9, when the queens were leaving, Angeria was in the corner cutting pieces of the fabric wall to keep. Naysha also has a piece.

- They bring up the Drag Race Experience in Chicago. Detox has no idea about what it actually is and what goes on there. They ask the audience their opinions. One of the audience members gave a thumbs down, saying Blair St. Clair was lovely (Detox says ""beautiful gowns.. beautiful gowns""), and that everything else was trash. Detox says he should go back to the Experience and cut off a piece of the brick wall.

- Batty went to the Experience. Batty thought it was a real brick wall. Naysha then asks her if she has a gummy before she went. She did, and Naysha then goes ""yeah that's why you thought it was real""

- After the challenge, they all agree Punk was the best group. Their top two, including the audience, mentioned Briar & Jane as their top two. 

- Naysha then says starts talking about the Disco group. All she says is ""I think-"" before bursting out laughing.

- They mention Darlene's verse. Kara attempts to shade her by saying ""We love HIM, we love HIM"". Detox laughs. 

- They all say the Disco group was NOT disco at all. Batty says she couldn't understand Mandy's verse and says ""thank God for closed captions"".

- Naysha is surprised everyone wanted Disco because the Punk track was obviously the best. 

- Roxxxy thinks Mandy needs smaller lashes, and says while she does wear 72 pairs of lashes, but Mandy has a small face and the lashes are so big that it looks funny.

- They, specifically Roxxxy, all commend, Juicy for reusing her entrance look but being able to change it up by adding the black colouring.

- Kenya and Myki were their favourites from the Pop group.

- After the runways, they do 10's or chops for each queen. Athena got 10's from Batty and Kara, chop from everyone else. Darlene, Ciara, Juicy, Discord, Kenya, Myki, Nini, Vita, Jane and Briar, got 10's across the board. DD & Mia got consistent chops. They all said Mandy's was 'cute', but never gave it a chop or a 10.

- They all laugh at Discord walk again. Roxxxy finds it hilarious how Discord clearly has no idea she was a horrible walk.

- Roxxxy says they were being too nice with the 10's, and there should be a 5. Naysha disagrees, saying if you think someone's a 5, it's a chop.

- Before critiques, they all think the tops are Jane, Ciara & Briar. They commend the Punk girls for actually committing to being punk. 

- After critiques, they agree that Jane was the clear winner, and that Mandy & DD were the bottom two, but thought Darlene would be the LOW(er) queen over Athena. 

- Detox is bored this episode, and was falling asleep during it. Naysha agrees saying the episode fizzled from the start. 

- After the elimination, Naysha asks the audience to make some noise for DD. They are pretty quiet with their cheer. 

- Kara says to give it up for Mandy because she didn't think that Mandy would win the lipsync.

- Roxxxy loves Mandy, and thinks she's a great performer, but says she needs more time to cook. 

- Naysha thinks that if Ru watches you perform and thinks ""I wanna see you again"" and that you are an exciting performer, she'll keep you. Naysha lost both of her lipsyncs, so according to her, she's an unexciting performer. 

- She says that if you have to cut a queen off to get attention during a lipsync, you're already doing something wrong. One of the audience members yells ""Ginger!"". Detox calls Ginger her Puerto Rican princess.

- Batty says to send out a search and rescue for Mandy's lash glue, and then goes onto say that next week, she's gonna bring Mandy some lash glue considering Chicago is the windy city. They all say it was shady that nobody told her to glue it down before the runway.

- Naysha says she's going to ask every single queen who comes to Roscoe's why they didn't help her with her lash. Detox tells her the question should be ""Hi, welcome to Chicago! What the fuck is wrong with you?""

- Roxxxy recalls seeing Serena's panties on S5 Ep. 02, and remembers asking Detox if they should tell her. Detox adds ""well.. we didn't like her soo.. nope! Get back to work!""

- Detox wonders if Mandy went and added her reveal under the table during Untucked. Batty calls it the table with ""accoutrements and things"". Roxxxy says throughout the lipsync she kept taking more things off like ""oop forgot to take these off!"". Detox then impersonates an inflatable man outside a car dealership. 

- Naysha commends Mandy for her entire outfit including her wig falling off during the lipsync but still winning. 

- Detox says Mandy should have been like a magician where they pull the table cloth off and all items remain intact. 

- They all didn't like the episode, calling it boring and pointing out the lack of drama. Roxxxy says she heard through the grapevine it was a very Kumbaya season. 

- Naysha says sometimes she reads online that the Roscoe's episode is more exciting than the main episode. I can guarantee you that this has never been said anywhere.




**VIP Exclusive**

Everything from here on out is VIP subscriber exclusive.


- Batty says Mandy should start a lash line. 

- Kara has a surprise video message from Coco Montrese for questions for Roxxxy and Detox. Coco asks Roxxxy at what point during All Stars 2 she felt guilty for sending her home on the first week (and whether it was when Adore quit, or when PhiPhi started acting a fool after singing off key to her own song). Roxxxy says she felt guilt right when it she picked Coco's lipstick. 

- Coco asks Detox whether she was being strategic when she put Alyssa and Coco together for the Can I Get An Amen? challenge on S5. Roxxxy reveals her and Detox were laughing about it and planned it. Detox says they were being annoying and wanted them to shut up, and that when they started complaining about being together, she chose them to go first in the challenge.

- Detox says her and Coco have been friends for her entire drag career, and Roxxxy points out ""we basically started drag together"". Detox adds ""we did"" before Roxxxy says ""yeah, not Ginger, but us"" 

- They all make some noise for Coco, Detox says ""looking just like that oil painting that you post!"", and that Coco is blind as a bat and that she genuinely thinks she looks sickening in her filters.




**VIP Subscriber Questions**

- *Joseph in San Diego asks Detox and Roxxxy what their last-minute song choice for a gig is.*

Roxxxy says anything Jessie Ware, and specifically mentions Pearls.

- *Andy in New York asks if Rolaskatox is ever getting back together for a collab.*

Detox says probably, and they constantly get offers for tours together but their schedules never line up. They mention that they were supposed to have a Rolaskatox tour last year in the US, but Roxxxy couldn't do it so Willam filled in, and it was a Wilaskatox tour. Kara adds ""love Willam, he's a great guy"".

 
- *Naysha and Batty both love this question so much, they say it out loud in unison. Anthony asks Detox and Roxxxy their favourite Ginger Minj lie. Anthony's favourite lie is that Jennifer Aniston bought her a coffee on set.*

Roxxxy says ""so many to choose from!"" but is confused by why Ginger lied about certain things like Cynthia Erivo's alleged battle cry when it could easily be disproved. Batty also mentions how her own drag mother was in Top 5 of Miss Continental Plus with Roxxxy when she won, and again disproves Ginger's lie that she was holding Roxxxy's hand when she won. She also again says that Ginger and her did NOT start drag together. Roxxxy says Ginger doesn't need to lie to be liked, because she's already well loved by so many and there's no need to ""expand the truth""

- Detox wonders Ginger has actually been at Ru's house for game nights. 

- Naysha says its very hard for her to feel bad for someone who just won $200k. She mentions that when she was fundraising money with Ginger in Puerto Rico after a hurricane, Ginger never mentioned she was Puerto Rican. Roxxxy interrupts to say ""wait but was she half or was she a quarter back then?"" 

- Detox demands a blood test with Ginger's DNA.




**Audience questions**

- *Clayton asks Roxxxy and Detox that outside of the show, what other iconic things [other than the show] have they done that's legendary.*

Roxxxy impersonates Ginger by saying Beyoncé just called her but she couldn't answer. Beyoncé wanted to sing her Halo as a lullaby. She goes onto say her and Detox have done a lot of charity work together and the fact that their season was 13 seasons ago and they're still considered legendary is iconic as it is. Detox agrees. 

- *Audience member from New York asks who they think is going to win the season.*

Before he can finish his question, Detox says ""I don't give a fuck"". Roxxxy says Myki or Jane.

- *Eric asks if they were to ever be cast on Slaycation, or to ever go on a girls trip, what two queens would they bring and where would they go.*

Detox and Roxxxy would bring eachother and mention also bringing Naysha. It's almost as if they want to hate their trip. 

- *Gabriel asks them what challenge from a different franchise they would like to see brought to the US franchise.*

They all agree the design for the host challenge is a good idea, and would be so iconic for RuPaul. Detox says she doesn't watch the international franchises, so she has no idea. 



**After the ep/Misc**

- Roxxxy was calling Myki on stage last night in Orlando and spotted Briar in the crowd. When introducing Myki to the stage, she accidentally said ""from Season 18 of RuPaul's Drag Race, it's Briar Blush!"" 

- Naysha and Detox think that a lot of legendary pageant queens don't want to go on the show because they don't want to ruin their reputations.

**Thoughts/Opinions/Extras**

- It was a pretty boring episode tbh, considering it was Roxxxy & Detox. I ended up cutting a lot because it was genuinely just unnecessary or uninteresting.

- A little less Naysha lashings this week... but trust. They are not over.

- Next week's guests are Mandy Mango and Carson Kressley!",40,1768096045.0,SDRUntucked,7,0.98,False

What do you do about that? Safety measures wise?

2. How do you deal with plumbers and such? I am about to take a course myself, coz I am uncomfortable dealing with them. Most are men here and one literally asked me if I am not afraid having him around (different culture I guess but still) and another one overcharged me significantly… 

3. What do you do about people trying to invade your place? Or are there such people? I live in a big city and rent has been skyrocketing here, so now and then someone trying to move in with me. Friends, their kids etc. I am trying to be nice to people in general, but even having a roommate I barely see feels like pressure… Live alone noisy families with no respect to boundaries. Ok, that exact friend was cut off for good, but there are others. The weird thing, that despite of me being clear about my discomfort, some say that I “must be lonely and they only mean good”, or trying to guilt trip me or such.
