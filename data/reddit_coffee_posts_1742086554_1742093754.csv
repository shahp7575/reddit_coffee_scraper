I’m gonna have a conversation with this guy that I’ve known for three weeks now. We met online (never met in person due to long distance), and text almost every day (albeit less now than we did in the beginning). We’ll also do video chats once a week. We’ve had three of them so far, although they had to be cut short.

About the conversation: I’m confused if he likes me or not. Before our first video chat, we talked a lot throughout the days, and maybe he was even flirting a little? But ever since our first video chat, he’s been messaging me a lot less. Maybe he doesn’t feel the need to text as much now that we video chat? Also, he IS going through a lot personally, and DID go through a situation that I’m sure affected his communication with me, but it seems to be better now. So I’m confused about him messaging me less, and am gonna talk to him about this. In particular I’m gonna ask if everything’s okay with him, if I said something that might’ve put him off, what works best for him with communication. But I’m also thinking of telling him that I have feelings for him.

Is it too early to do that? I know I don’t know him that well, but people will sometimes show interest (i.e. asking them out for coffee) right off the bat. And, hey, I do know a LITTLE bit about him because of our video chats, and what I do see I like. Is it still too early to tell him how I feel though? Should I just have the conversation about our change in communication patterns without admitting my feelings?

1jcbx4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jcbx4x/help_recommend_me_a_grinder_aud_10001500/,Help recommend me a grinder. [AUD $1000-1500],"Hi all.

Ordered the Bambino Plus which will be delivered next week (had some frequent flyer points which allowed me to purchase this machine for essentially $50 out of pocket). I currently have a 1zpresso J ultra hand grinder but will look to palm that off to a relative soon, so I am in the market for a new grinder.

    Budget: $1000-1500 AUD
    Usage: 90% Milk based drinks (inc iced coffee/latte), 10% espresso. (subject to change once we get the gear!)
    Frequency: 2 x adults once a day, possibly extend to twice a day.

I have looked at a few entry level grinders reviews (Varia VS3/6, DF54/v, DF64/v, DF83/V, Encore ESP, Timemore 064s, etc) but am having a tough time deciding on a path to take as the machines all have cons which sway my decision.

Ideally I am after:

    Single dose grinder
    Easy to work with, out-of-the-box (not interested in upgrading burrs at this stage, might as well put the budget to a higher end grinder if that's the case).
    Easy to perform maintenance/cleaning. Should perform with minimum static buildup
    Able to process light to dark beans without stalling or risk of motor failure.
    Doesnt sound like a turbo jet engine in the morning
    Not shy in paying once, crying once. If the budget can be extended but covers the wish list then I am happy to make that move.

Maybe down the line I might want to obtain the Mazzer Philos (unless I can be convinced now), as it tickets a few more boxes with durability and build finish.

I wanted to ask for some insight about a couple of things I’ve noticed recently (last two weeks) concerning my heart/hands/feet. I’ve attached some pictures in the comments to show what I mean.

-Elevated heart rate for the past week: as soon as I stand up, my heart rate climbs up to 100 bpm (more than double my resting rate). I also sometimes get the same feeling you get when you drink way too much coffee.

-Right foot redness: My feet are usually very cold and white (always had cold hands and feet), but my right foot (mostly my big toe) sometimes becomes red, tingly, and hot, while my left foot stays normal. Lasts about 20-40 minutes and goes away on it’s own. I usually lie down when it happens so it might help idk. This happened for the first time two weeks ago and has happened again a few times since.

-Fingertip redness: I’ve also noticed that my fingertips sometimes appear red while the rest of my hand looks a more normal color. 
	
-Hands turning white after clenching: I took a video of myself clenching my fist tightly and then opening it, and my hand turned abnormally white afterward before returning to normal. Noticed this while biking. I’ve included three pictures—one of my hand at rest, one with my fist closed, and one just after opening it. I understand this should be quite normal, but never experienced it to this extent. On the contrary, my hands also become really red and even bluish when they’re below my heart and come back to normal when I put them in the air. This mostly happens when I’m in the shower.

Took my blood pressure at the drug store results came out at 139/85, no clue what these numbers mean.

May be unrelated but I also have experience major headaches (past weak) and nausea (past months)


I’m wondering if these could be signs of a circulation issue or something else I should be concerned about. I have really bad health anxiety so I could be reading Into it too much, although I’m almost certain something is off with my heart. I’d really appreciate any insights or advice. 

Ps. Before yelling at me for not going to the clinic or something I already have a appointment scheduled April 9th with my family doctor.

I just moved back from Canada to Hyderabad and one thing I see missing here is premium wellness centres to connect with like minded individuals while also engaging in recovery. 

So the idea would be to launch a premium wellness space in India (Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore) that combines sauna + cold plunge therapy—not just for recovery but as a “third space” for health-conscious individuals. It would be designed in a high-end, artistic way, catering to those who appreciate the finer things.

Concept Highlights:
	•	A place for gym-goers, yoga/meditation practitioners (late 20s–40s) to recover, connect, and unwind.
	•	A coffee bar/lounge to create a social, community-driven experience.
	•	Investment: ~₹60L ($100K CAD), inspired by Tality Spa.

1jcbljg,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1jcbljg/my_experience_growing_up_sda/,My experience growing up SDA,"I came across this community trying to see if others held the same opinions I do about the SDA church, especially those who were raised in it.  I'm so grateful to find other like-minded individuals on here.

With that being said, I was born into an SDA family.  I'm a 5th generation Adventist, and my parents are definitely not the liberal type of SDA Christians.  Both of my parents are very traditional people when it comes to their marriage, my dad went to work and my mom stayed home with my younger sister and I.  I never experienced attending kindergarten, since my mom homeschooled me for that, using some lame SDA program.  Even she admits I learned nothing from it.  Following this, I attended an SDA school from grade 1-2, and went back to homeschooling after the first month of 3rd grade (by my own request, which I regret SO MUCH to this day).

And I do want to highlight, the kids who went to that SDA school with me were more liberal Adventists.  They did their own activities on Saturdays, their moms wore jewelry, and they could watch movies I was not allowed to watch.  So just imagine, you grew up being taught that these things are not what you are supposed to do, yet you see your peers, who are SDA like you, doing those same things.  That definitely struck a chord in me and that was when I started questioning a lot of things.

I was never allowed to go to the movies, in a theater, or go to Disney or any other amusement park (for some reason Ellen White says we should not be doing either of these).  I was born a vegan, because of the Ellen White diet.  Never allowed to drink coffee or eat chocolate, we had to replace that with carob when we baked desserts at home.  It sucked for me when I saw other kids who were SDA eating the chocolate cupcakes at a birthday party, or devouring their cheese pizza, while I had to sit and watch them enjoy it, pretending as if I didnt feel bad.

Going out to eat with my family is so irritating when it comes to ordering our foods.  The menu will be full of options but we barely have options and have to substitute everything.

I was never allowed to be in sports, since Ellen White said that we should not participate in competitive activities since it will make us focus on ourselves and make us prideful.  As it is, I was never a very athletic kid so I didnt feel I was missing out too much.

I always felt bad that I could not be a normal girl and wear jewelry and paint my nails.  That was a huge no for my parents, and even wearing a hair tie on our wrists made them upset.  They would act as if we were trying to wear bracelets and my dad sternly told us he never wants to see us wearing that on our wrists to church.  It was only till I was 19 that I started to buy clear polish, then after several arguements, I started doing very natural mani-pedis.

I was quite sheltered all my childhood, although my parents will always claim that they are not even strict and give us freedom.  I was never allowed sleepovers because Ellen White said so, and couldnt go hang out with friends at their house, even though they were SDA too.  I was never allowed PG-13 movies, or any movie that had the slightest curse word, including ""damn"" or ""hell"".  Cursing is a GIANT no in this house, and that upsets my parents to no end.

When I was around 14, I started going online and chatting with guys in chat rooms.  I met this dude on there, a year older than me, and ""dated"" him for about 3 months till my mom caught me up at night texting on my computer.  After that, my unrestricted internet access was completely cut off.  I did this same type of thing at least 3 more times, then stopped after I turned 16.

That same year I turned 16, which was during the pandemic, we packed up our beautiful home (so grateful for having the means for that) and left for a smaller home in a very very rural part of Pennsylvania.  Ellen White stressed so much about country living, so, you can finish that part for me! I hated it at first but then got used to it, now it sucks again because I'm not sure how I am supposed to start my career with living far from every good job out there.  But, the world has gotten crazy and it is safer out here, but it is not practical for someone trying to find good income and figure out their life.

When I was 18, during my second semester of my freshman year, I met this guy on a discord server.  We quickly became friends, then only 10 days later we confessed our feelings for each other.  Now, two years later, he is my boyfriend and I am planning to marry this wonderful man one day.

He is not SDA, which worried me a lot because my parents were strict about us only dating and marrying SDA guys.  However, to my surprise, they ended up finding out about our relationship a year ago and they accept him, but they expect that I will be having him convert to SDA religion, otherwise they cannot bless our marriage.  Guess what? He will not become SDA, nor will I ever tell him to do so.  What matters to me is that Jesus is in his heart and that he obeys THE BIBLE ITSELF (Ellen White is not the Bible).

This man has really helped me wake up from a lot of things and I am trying my best now to reprogram my mind, after being taught things all my life that are not in the Bible.  I have long conversations with him about how cultish the religion can be and that what matters is that we are real Christians and try to do good and follow Jesus himself.  I will always be grateful to my boyfriend for this, for being someone who I can talk to about this and reason with more.

Today, I still am living with my SDA parents and sister.  I am an online college student, in my 3rd year and stressing about my internship situation this summer (because I live so far).  This means that I kind of spend a lot of time at home with my parents and they are always talking about something.

Last year was the first time that I ever voted, my parents suprisingly let me make my own decision on whether I can vote or not.  They are against it since Ellen White says not to vote. But they always are saying that the person I voted for is corrupt, or will bring this nation to a bad place, blah blah.  Half the time I am up in my room, working on school, or pretending I am because I get so tired being around them all day with my mom constantly talking about something that will irritate me or make me feel guilty for absolutely no reason.  It gets in my head so much then I go talk to my boyfriend and it clears my mind so much.

It's hard when you are trying to wake up from things, but constantly are getting fed more things that make you question everything even more.  It affects my relationship with God so much. From reading many of your posts on here, I see that a lot of you are atheists.  For me, I will never be anything but a Christian.  I follow the Bible as good as I can.  My boyfriend and I are not waiting for marriage even though the Bible has told us to do so, only because we will be marrying each other and trust each other to that level.  We date to marry and will be each others only partners.  Many will say that cant happen, but it is very possible I promise.

I love Jesus and I want to know the Jesus in the Bible, and take my beliefs from the Bible itself.  I am a conservative woman and against feminism.  Please no hate for this, I respect those who have the opposite beliefs as long as you respect mine.  I have traditional values, and so does my boyfriend, that is what we have built our relationship on.

I plan to raise my children to love God and follow the Bible.  I do believe that Saturday is the correct day to worship, since the BIBLE specifies it.  So I probably will still be attending SDA church with my future family, only because no other church out there worships on Saturdays.  As for keeping Saturdays, I may take off the day from work but I will not be depriving myself of having some fun on the weekends and depriving my children from playing sports and having fun with their friends.  What matters to me is that we attend church, and I certainly will not be using Ellen White to base my parenting and decisions off of.  I see her as a person giving us advice and suggestions, not as a replacement for the Bible. 

 I will definitely not be eating vegan once I move out also, nor vegetarian!  I plan to slowly introduce meat into my diet, and become animal based. Also coffee and chocolate, I cannot wait to start my mornings off with that! Right now, no meat or dairy products or coffee or chocolate is allowed in the house. I've been watching a lot of animal based influencers who dive into the science of feeding your body with REAL foods, not some processed vegan junk, full of seed oils, preservatives, and chemicals to lower your testosterone levels.  The bible mentions raw milk, cows, goats, and fish hundreds of times, but I do not see tofu or Loma Linda meats in there lol.  Eat biblically!

I know there is creme base for the not-coffee fraps and then a coffee one for the rest, and that that ingredient is what emulsifies the frap and makes it the correct texture. Do either (or both) of the frappuccino bases contain sugar? 

Are frap roast and frap base the same or are they two different things? I remember reading that a lot of people think the frap roast is gross, so I tried to order a frappuccino with espresso instead of frap roast. I ended up with a creme based frap with espresso shots poured on top, which made the texture different, and that's why I'm seeking clarification here.

My mom can not have any sugar. It will make her very sick. She likes frozen blended coffee drinks with strong coffee flavor and a bit of sweetness. Starbucks is confusing for her, but she's about to go on a long car trip and I know she will want to get something on the road.

What can I tell her to ask for to make sure that she gets a Frappuccino that preferably contains espresso (but not affogato shots) or at least coffee base and is a little sweet but contains absolutely no sugar. Would a sf vanilla espresso frappuccino make sense to order? I don't want this interaction to be confusing for her or the barista bc I won't be there in person to help. I just want to tell her how to get a tasty frozen coffee bev that will be the intended texture and won't hurt her.

He moved in with us a long time ago, and his memory and things have quickly declined over the past year or so. He has weekly check ups, but we know he must be dealing with some form of memory loss. He's always been quite a rude and judgemental man, which I know is obvious because he's elderly, but he's gotten worse. On top of being racist, homophobic, misogynistic, narcissistic, and sexist, he only ever really talks to my dad even if everyone else is there, and has ignored us on purpose multiple times for no reason.

My dad has talked to him but he didn't change or seem sorry at all, didn't apologise to us or anything. My mother put signs up, telling him what day it was, or where everyone was, but he didn't read them and just went to my dad. He has his TV on full volume every night, and when we ask if he could turn it down, he will keep it low for five minutes and then turn it up again. He laughs whenever my dad talks to him about his behaviour, and doesn't care that he's causing a problem that is moving my family apart. When my dad talks to him, my granddad talks about out, unprompted, as there are a lot of cheap places to stay in my area. I think he's saying it to get pity, but he might be serious.

And recently my family has said that they want him to leave, which is where I don't really agree with. I've told them that he's elderly and that he has problems, and yes he's a nuisance but we can't really just make him buy another place to live because it's not very fair. But they just get annoyed with me, and I can't get through to them, i'm outvoted and I wouldn't be able to do anything if they let him leave. He wouldn't be homeless, as I said there are plenty of options for him to live, but I don't know. Apart from his memory loss and diabetes, he hasn't got any other problems as far as I know. He leaves the house on his own everyday to go shopping, or have a coffee, (walking, we stopped him from driving), and always comes home fine. I've just been stressing over this for a while and I wanted some help if anyone can give it to me please.",7,1742091024.0,AmItheAsshole,20,0.82,False

Here’s how it works in plain English:

	•	You buy some SOLMAX coins: It’s like buying shares in this club. You hold onto them in a digital wallet, kind of like a virtual piggy bank.
	•	Every time someone buys or sells SOLMAX, there’s a fee: They take 10% of every transaction—like a little toll. That money doesn’t just disappear; it goes into a pot to keep the club going strong.
	•	That fee turns into rewards for you: The club uses that 10% to buy more of a coin called SOL (the big currency on Solana, like the dollar in this world). Then, they share that SOL with everyone holding SOLMAX coins. It’s like getting a dividend check in the mail, but it happens automatically—pretty neat, right?
	•	They sell some coins now and then: The club cashes out some SOLMAX coins at smart times to keep the cash flowing. This keeps your rewards coming regularly, almost like a paycheck for just sitting tight.
	•	They manage extra coins to keep things steady: If there are too many coins floating around, they scoop some up and hold them back. This helps keep the value from bouncing around too much—think of it like stabilizing the price of your favorite coffee so it doesn’t jump from $1 to $5 overnight.
	•	Nobody’s in charge, and that’s a good thing: The club’s rules are locked in by something called a “renounced contract.” It’s like putting the club’s charter in a safe that no one can mess with—not even the folks who started it. This keeps it fair and safe, run by the community, not some bigwig.

So, what’s in it for you? If you buy SOLMAX and hang onto it, you get a little extra SOL trickling in over time without lifting a finger—passive income, like rent from a property you don’t have to fix up. Plus, you’re part of a group that’s all about keeping things secure and growing together. It’s a modern twist on investing, but instead of stocks or bonds, it’s digital coins rewarding you for sticking around",7,1742090899.0,SolanaMemeCoins,8,1.0,False

I don’t use the word obsessed lightly as I am diagnosed comorbid ocd and ADHD and GAD

I spend most nights planning out my morning so my meds work correctly. Take med first, don’t eat, take a tums if you do, don’t have coffee, check a yogurt label to see if it has any acidic properties to it, google if it’s acidic, scroll these subreddits to see if anyone relates or has tips… like the amount of times these things pop into my head like little scary reminders like “oh! A coffee right now! It hasn’t yet been an hour since you took your medicine. Now it won’t work. It’s not working. You will be comatose with no emotional regulation all day.”

Then all day I am constantly, constantly checking in with myself to see how I feel. Do I have motivation right now? Can I get off the couch? Why am I so tired? I’m back to paralysis. I can’t do anything. Nothing works. Adderall doesn’t work. I’ll never be fixed. Google how to fix this. 

I’ll start by saying I really do not believe my medications do work correctly. They wear off SO quickly, even XR. I’ve posted about it a few times with still no luck from my psych. They kinda just brush it off with a “a pill wont solve everything” attitude, which I agree. So I get almost fearful of the “they’re not working anymore” feeling, and i hyperfixate on that. So sometimes I’m like maybe it’s better to just fully go off them and be my anhedonic self full time. 

Now that I have felt normalcy, I’m obsessed with the idea of making it last // not going back to my normal (which is sluggish, depressed, anhedonia)

Saturday was a busy day for him because he was working an event outdoors all day and didn’t get back until 8pm.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Or if it's under a different name. I think it might originally be a Chinese novel that's translated. 
Chapter 1 
“If we get hitched, you gotta quit your job and stay home. Take care of me, and pop out a healthy baby boy within a year!! don’t want a girl, cause girls need more parenting!” 
The man said with a smug grin. 
Ellinor Mendoza looked at her blind date, a balding, chubby man in his forties. 
Her stepmother, Tracy, must have wanted her to settle for a less desirable man, hence the pressure to meet this unsuitable 
date. 
The middle–aged man had initially criticized Ellinor’s makeup, but seeing her slim figure and decent demeanor, he figured she was quite the catch. 
He then asked, “How tall are you?” 
Ellinor, bored stiff, stirred her coffee nonchalantly and replied softly, “5‘ 6“.” 
The middle–aged man seemed pleased. “Hmm, your height is just about right for me. I’m about 5‘ 7“. You might need to stand on your toes when we kiss. But no worries, I can bend down a bit for you!” 
Ellinor’s eyelid twitched slightly. “Sir, I think you might be misunderstood. A man who needs a woman to stand on her toes to kiss him should be somewhat taller than you.” 
The middle–aged man frowned, displeased. “What do you mean?” 
Just then, a tall and imposing man walked into the coffee shop, radiating a strong aura. 
Ellinor glanced up and noticed the man. She got up and walked over to him. 
“Excuse me, handsome. Could you come over here for a second?” 
The magnificent man’s gaze turned cold. Before he could decline, Ellinor grabbed his tie, stood on her toes, and planted a precise kiss on his lips. 
“See? You should at least be as tall as him to deserve a woman standing on her toes for a kiss.” 
“You…” 
The middle–aged man was embarrassed and angry, pointing at Ellinor 
“You’re so audacious, kissing a stranger like that! I will tell the matchmaker about this and ruin your reputation. You can forget about finding a date in future!” 
Ellinor scoffed. This was exactly what she wanted. 
After the middle–aged man stormed off angrily, Ellinor waved at the tall man who had helped her. 
“Thank you for your help, sir! If fate allows, we’ll meet again. Goodbye!” 
She turned to leave, but her wrist was suddenly gripped by a cold, strong hand! 
A deep, icy voice reached her ears. 
“You kissed me, and you think you can just walk away?” 
She felt an overwhelming pressure, and looked up to a handsome face suddenly appearing in her line of sight. 
His face was stunning! 
His hair was elegantly combed, his features were sharp, and his expression was calm. He gave the impression he could 
handle any situation with ease. 
There was also a hint of danger! 
Ellinor thought to herself, “I was so focused on getting rid of that middle–aged man and picking the tallest man nearby to kiss, I didn’t pay attention to his face. Now that I look closely, he’s unusually handsome and has a unique aura!” 
Ellinor frowned slightly. “…What are you going to do?”  [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1742090047.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False

I’m not religious at all, and super open-minded, so I decided to go. It was all fine and everyone was nice, but I found the watchtower portion of the meeting really odd, so here’s my question.. is it normal that the audience is literally parroting the exact reading and scripture, like verbatim the entire time?

The first few people I heard, I chalked up to maybe just some slowness.. idk how to explain, but the entire thing went that way.

My son and I were planning on going. He called two hours before, and said he was in my neighborhood and had time to kill so he asked to stop by. I panicked, the house was a mess, my kid was a mess, I was a mess. 

I paused and remembered this friend has a child with autism. I relaxed. He came over and my son instantly took a liking to him. They played dinosaurs, my son gave him a tour of the house. No explanations were needed about his word approximations, standing on his head, toe walking, at one time running out of the front door. All was peaceful. We went for a walk to the coffee shop together, and saw him play. My son did well and wandered around and tried to go up on stage with his new friend a few times,  but nothing out of the ordinary or control by redirection.

My friend didn't want to call me out with the audience, but he told me ahead of time a song he was dedicating to us which he wrote for his son with autism. It was the one song my kid actually sat still for.

Thanks for listening and providing any insight. It feels weird coming to reddit for this… but I can’t afford a counselor, and really need some outside opinions. 

The past 24 hours has been a whirlwind. On a business trip that my GF of 2 years came along with. Had a fun night of dinner and drinks with some friends then retired to the hotel. Got ready for bed, time to cuddle, things were fine. She says she sent me some insta posts she wanted to watch with me(often our bedtime routine). We open insta and the first thing that pops up on my feed is a video from a page I follow that shows “karma” type videos(Karen’s freaking out and then tripping and falling, etc), except this particular video is obviously them going clickbait mode and it’s a video of a girl in a car starting to pull her pants down.

She sees this video and is like “what the hell are you watching!?” And I’m like “well that’s not what is usually on here”, I show her the account, the typical videos that are not like that, laugh and move on to watch the videos she sent me. After that, I can tell she’s unhappy, and she takes my phone and blocks the account, which I told her was fine and no problem.  

From then on she gets distant, no longer wanting to cuddle, not talking, pushing me away when I attempt to put an arm around her. Maybe I should’ve pressed the issue and tried to make her talk about it more, but at this point it was late and I had to work in the morning so I attempted to go to sleep. 

I slept horribly, waking often, worried about her being upset, and each time I awoke she was just sitting up, scrolling on her phone, not attempting to go to sleep, up until I woke up to go to work. We had planned on getting up together, getting breakfast or coffee, her coming with me to the work event that she had expressed interest in seeing. Instead she decided she was just going to sleep in, which I didn’t complain about but was disappointed. 

She texts me while I’m at the work event, saying I don’t make her feel wanted or sexy when I’m “looking at naked women online”, I don’t compliment her enough, etc. Granted I’m not a super vocal guy when it comes to feelings and such, and we’ve had issues with that before, but I do try to work on that. But it seems that video got those thoughts going with her. 

I apologized, tried to console her through text. When the work event was done, I came back to the hotel and she was sitting in the car so I got in and could tell she was still upset and not talkative so I asked if she wanted to discuss things. 

She is distraught and starts telling me that she feels like I must be always looking at such things online because she looked through my Instagram last night while I was asleep and there was a message from a lifelong friend(we’ll call him Bill”) on there. It was an odd video I admit, a clothed woman dancing provocatively with what looked like Angelina Jolies face on another body. This was odd, as he never sends me messages on insta, heck I can rarely get a text reply from him most days. Bill does a lot of drugs and has had some rough times lately so I just chalked it up to him being high. So that had her more upset. 

Then she brings up a month ago when another lesser friend had sent an insta video that was of some lady saying something about open faced roast beef while part of her anatomy was hanging out and glimpsed for a split second at the end, making a crude joke obviously. She was sitting next to me when I opened it, and we watched it together, and she was offended by it and we didn’t talk for at least a day then. 

Then she brings up another time when an even lesser friend(more like an acquaintance become occasional fishing buddy) sent a meme with a topless girl holding a fish. Admittedly he’s a dirty ol man, and sends stuff like that occasionally to a group chat of fishing buddies, mixed with tinfoil hat conspiracy videos and similar types of dumb humor that I scroll on past. 

So these three things are combined to have her really upset, thinking I’m just “sharing porn” nonstop with all my friends. Now i definitely have some crude, immature, goofy friends from all walks of life, and I do sometime cringe and scroll on through the group chats. But it’s not a very common occurrence that something is sexual in nature. 

I try to console her, and promise I’ll try to do better about not engaging on stuff like that. I never actively share such things, and if I see a shared thing that’s clearly going to be inappropriate to her I do scroll on. But I’m kind of at a loss as to what to do? Do I leave my friend group chats? Do I call them out in the group chats? Call them on the phone and berate them? I convey this to her, that I can’t guarantee 100% of the time that I can control what my friends might say or do. 

Next she says “while we’re clearing the air, when’s the last time you went to a strip club?” I told her it was when Bill had taken the guys on a trip about 2 years ago. At that time, we had met and been intimate for a few months, but not officially dating… She was still currently dating, in an open relationship, her previous boyfriend. They were in that stage when she and I first met, which was very odd for me, being kinda old fashioned I guess. But I was trying to be open minded and we really did enjoy each others company. Fast forward to today, she eventually broke up with the ex BF, and we have been exclusively dating each other, very seriously, practically living together ever since. 

I had never told her about the strip club trip, knowing she was very disapproving of strip clubs in general.  Honestly I didn’t feel that at that point, while she was still dating another guy and we weren’t officially dating, that I was obligated to not go nor obligated to tell her about it. But currently, I felt I should be honest since she asked, and since we are now dating exclusively and are very committed, I would not go to a strip club if asked to go, out of respect for her. 

So now she gets even more upset at hearing this, saying she never thought I’d be such a liar, etc. I explained to her what I said in the previous paragraph above, but she’s crying at this point, storms out of the car, and goes into the hotel. 

 Now I’m sitting in the car upset, sad for her, sad for me, confused, lost, and don’t know wtf to do from here. Any advice, insight, criticism are very welcome and again, thanks if you took the time to read all this. ",1,1742088758.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

I'm not a doctor, but I've been living with this condition for about a decade now.

I first noticed something was off back in college when I started losing my voice and struggling to speak during a public speaking class. At first, I thought it was just a cold and post nasal drip that wouldn’t go away, but it kept getting worse and eventually i felt like i was struggling to swallow. After seeing an ENT and following up with a gastroenterologist, I found out I had LPR and turns out it’s linked to a hiatal hernia and a weak esophageal muscle. Fun times. 😅

Managing LPR has definitely been a journey. Lots of trial and error, some brutal flare-ups, and stretches where symptoms barely showed up at all. But over time, I’ve picked up a bunch of strategies that really help. I thought I’d share what’s worked (and what hasn’t) in case it can make things a little easier for someone else dealing with the same thing.

**What’s Helped Me**

* **Standing and Moving** 
   * One of the simplest but most effective things I’ve I’ve found is that spending more of my day standing and getting regular exercise really helps. Running three to four times a week for about 20 minutes makes a noticeable difference in my symptoms. I think it helps with digestion and weight management, which both seem to keep reflux under control
* **Managing Stress** 
   * This one took me a while to figure out, but stress is a huge trigger for me. High-stress periods almost always bring on a bad flare-up. 
* **Losing Weight**
   *  My weight has fluctuated between around **215 lbs and 175 lbs** over the years, and I’ve noticed a huge difference in symptoms at the lower end. When I’m closer to 180, my symptoms are way less frequent and much more manageable. 
* **Diet (Only When Things Get Bad)**
   *  I don’t follow a super strict LPR diet all the time, but when I’m going through a bad flare-up, cutting out acidic and trigger foods helps calm things down. Once symptoms settle, I can usually loosen up a bit without too much trouble. 
* **Carafate for Flare-Ups**
   *  When I feel a flare-up coming on, I dissolve a **Carafate pill** in a bit of water, gargle it, and swallow it. Doing this for a few days helps coat and protect my throat, and it usually calms things down pretty quickly.
* **Sleeping with a Wedge**
   *  self explanatory 
* C**utting Out Caffeine and alcohol (Temporarily)**
   *  I love coffee, but when I feel symptoms ramping up, cutting out caffeine and alcohol for **three days or so** usually helps reset things. Once things calm down, I can usually always reintroduce without too much trouble.
* **Small Meals for a Few Days**
   *  When I’m in a bad patch ill try to skip lunch or just eat smaller meals for a few days. 
* **No Late-Night Snacks**
   *  Eating too close to bedtime pretty much always results in waking up with mucus in the back of my sinuses and throat. so its a no go. 

LPR can be a real pain in the ass, but managing it *is* possible. It’s taken me years of trial and error to figure out what works for me and what doesn't. 

Hope this helps and if you’ve got any tips or questions, please let me know

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Too willing to impress

Too simple to be depressed

Happy to be able to fix their equipment and operate their machines complacent enough to not question the ends of our deeds

I just moved back from Canada to Hyderabad and one thing I see missing here is premium wellness centres to connect with like minded individuals while also engaging in recovery. 

So the idea would be to launch a premium wellness space in India (Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore) that combines sauna + cold plunge therapy—not just for recovery but as a “third space” for health-conscious individuals. It would be designed in a high-end, artistic way, catering to those who appreciate the finer things.

Concept Highlights:
	•	A place for gym-goers, yoga/meditation practitioners (late 20s–40s) to recover, connect, and unwind.
	•	A coffee bar/lounge to create a social, community-driven experience.
	•	Investment: ~₹60L ($100K CAD), inspired by Tality Spa.

**Chapter 8: Talks**

Maya’s room was small. She had a bed in one corner, a desk, bathroom with shower, small kitchen area, and some chairs organized around a table; there was little else. Maya sat in her desk chair, the same one she had since they were teens. Coco and Mymy pulled chairs to face her. The mood was tense as Maya was the first to break the silence.

“Alright. I invited you in, now what exactly do you want?” she didn't shout but her voice was filled with a notecable anger. 



Coco responded first. She had waited years for a moment like this and now, finally, Maya opened the door to her. Maya’s words from the previous night had hurt, but they had also enlightened her in many ways. For the first time she felt like she had a chance.

“We want to help you Maya. Both of us” she said, gesturing towards Mymy.

“We know you’re in pain and we now realize just how much we hurt you”



Her words carried a sad and repentant yet also determined tone, spoken to ensure that the listener received the full weight of the speaker's love. 



Maya realized that this was different, the way Coco spoke was different. She had never seen Coco like this. It seemed like for once she was being humble and genuine, different from the half hearted apologies of old, which Maya had always seen as hollow. 



Coco continued:

“You may never forgive us. But we still love you Maya, and though we may not have been there for you in the past, we’re here for you now, and we want to show it”

  


Mymy then spoke up

“We want to take you out” she said with joy, a happy and determined smile strewn across her face.

“We want to include you in as much as we can during our break.” she paused to let her words sink in.

“If you’ll let us” added Mymy  



Maya didn't know what to say. Her life had been made hellish and lonely by the two people before her. Yet, those same people now came to her in love and sincere sorrow for their actions. 



Maya looked down and thought as her sisters eagerly anticipated her response.

Maya thought back to all the times she had turned down an invitation, a potential conversation, group, activity, or friend, countless missed opportunities, limitless potential lost because in the moment, the only thing that held her back was her own fear. And at the end of the day, ultimately it was HER choice, for all that had gone wrong, for all the blame that lay on the shoulders of others, Maya knew that only she could do something to break the cycle. 



This sudden realization, a fact she had hidden deep down, caused her to break. She curled up in her chair and cried, raw emotion, years of regret now crashed into her and it was too much. 



Mymy and Coco were taken by surprise when Maya suddenly burst into tears. Immediately the two got up and went to their sisters' side, wrapping her in a hug.



Maya was surprised at first but found comfort in their embrace. The three stayed like that for a while. Even after Maya had stopped crying, they sat in a silent embrace. Eventually Maya loosened her hold, signaling that the hug was over. The girls returned to their original seats, once again awaiting Maya's word.

“Alright” she said softly

“What did you have in mind?”

  


**Chapter 9: Baby steps**



*Why did I agree to this? Why didn't I just turn them away? They cant help me, why bother?* These thoughts danced around Maya's head all morning. She felt nothing but an anxious sickness, she put on her music and played some games on her computer but they only dulled the anxiety.

It felt like forever since the last time Maya had gone to any form of social activity. She remembered this feeling well. It was there every time before and especially during any event. To anyone else, coffee with one's siblings would be seen as a fun activity to look forward to. But to Maya, it was a two hour chore with two complete strangers. No, worse than strangers, people who, for most of her life, she perceived as malicious forces.

*Why am I giving them this chance again?* 



Her fear only grew as she got into her car and drove to the shop.

  


Mymy and Coco had already arrived at the coffee shop. They were brainstorming strategies and activities to get Maya out of her shell. Today, they wanted to spend some time one on one, getting to know Maya was something both wanted to do and something that would help them help her.

“Mathew and Antonio, are big into war gaming.”

“Wargaming?” asked Coco

“Yea” said Mymy, 

“Like using models and figures to play a game. They say that it's a great way to make friends. Its a social activity, and Antonio says that if you find the right group they are very welcoming” 

Coco added it to the list of activities and hobbies to introduce to Maya.

“Like her video games!” she said, gleefully writing it down.

They continued exchanging ideas, taking notes as they went.



Maya stepped into the shop and scanned the room for her sisters. It didn't take long to find them or for them to notice her.

“Hey” she said softly, taking her seat at the table

“Hoi Maya!” said Coco

“We’re so happy you came!”



Maya took her seat and Mymy could immediately see she was uncomfortable. She didn't recognize it when they were young but thinking back, Maya was always looking down, fidgeting with the drawstrings of her hoodie, or staring off into space, it was as if she was trying to be as absent and invisible as possible. She now saw it happening right next to her, Maya was sitting low in her seat and looking towards the floor, hands between her legs. 



Coco had always been a bit more involved with Maya, she was the only person to ever reach out or at least try to.



“So, Maya” began Coco

“We were talking about fun things that we could do together. Do you have any suggestions?”



Maya was stumped by the question. Years of no friends, hobbies, extracurriculars, or interaction in general meant her interests did not extend far beyond the games she played and shows she watched. This realization sank Maya's already poor mood, her internal sadness immediately became reflected in her face.



Coco saw her sister's face change and quickly put the pieces together. She was quick to follow up with clarification:

“It can be anything Maya. Shows, games, any interest of yours. We’re just brainstorming.”



Mymy also looked up from her notes, devoting full attention towards Maya. 



“W-well. I like anime and videogames. Is there something we can do with that?”

The sisters took note. Coco never figured out video games or anime but she would be happy to learn about the few interests Maya had. Mymy happily took her notes, Loui and Mathew had introduced her to anime and, while limited, Abel had introduced her to the Total War games in the academy. 



Maya watched as her sisters gleefully took down notes on her interests. She was surprised at their eagerness to learn her interests, it felt good. 



“Any specific games or shows?” asked Mymy eagerly.  

At this question Maya sat up more visibly, more at ease, more engaged.

Maya spent the next hours eagerly discussing her games and shows. She talked at length about the stories and narratives she would make up, occasionally stopping to answer a question. 



As Maya elaborated on her interests, Coco and Mymy encouraged her to continue and asked questions to keep her going. Over time, Maya became more and more comfortable and less and less encouragement was needed to keep her going. Of course the sisters still listened and engaged when possible, but for all intensive purposes, Maya was holding the conversation.



The lore and details of her favorite stories was relayed to inquiring ears for the first time and Maya was thrilled. 



Coco and Mymy were happy to listen. For the first time Maya was happy and energetically engaging with them. They were learning about their reclusive sister and it brought immense joy. Furthermore, both of them knew that this was invaluable information, Maya could open up and be social, she had interests and they could find people who shared those interests. This led Mymy to something that she was surprised she didn't ask sooner.

She waited for a pause in Mayas rant before asking her question

“So Maya, what music are you into?” 



Maya didn't have to think wrong about it, music had always been a great distraction for her, something that helped her dissociate. Maya was thrilled that now she was able to share it with her sisters.

“Oh, Its mostly alternative Rock, but I really enjoy lots of music”



“Could you share some with me? I’d love to hear some of it.” Said Mymy. Maya’s expression was gleeful, she could tell Mymy was genuinely interested in her music and wanted to try it.

“Of course!” she said excitedly “I’ll make it as soon as I get home”

“I would also love to hear some of your music Maya!” Said Coco happily. 



Maya nodded at Coco’s request. The topic of music reminded her of Coco’s band, ‘Running in the 60s.’ Without thinking, as if by instinct she asked:

“Are you still doing the band Coco, Running in the 60s?”



The question caught everyone off guard and there was a short silence that followed it. 

For the first time, Maya was the first to initiate a conversation. Not only start a new conversation, but inquire into her sister's life. Coco was deeply touched and inwardly ecstatic. Mymy was astounded and happy at this event. Maya realized that for the first time in her life, she had taken the initiative to know her sister, to know someone better. Everyone at the table realized the significance of what, for anyone else, would be a trivial question But to them, this was progress, this was groundbreaking.



“Y-yeah” stuttered Coco,

“Unfortunately we fell apart. We kept it together through some of college but eventually other priorities took over for everyone.” She paused, taking a sip of her Coffee.

“We stayed friends though, even after I left we kept close contact.” 

Maya was interested, she knew so little about her. Emboldened by Coco’s smile and positive response. Maya asked some more.



For the rest of their time, Maya and Coco conversed with occasional interjections from Mymy. Mymy didn't mind being more on the outside of the conversation, she was content to watch Maya be invested in conversation, learning more about Coco. She would get time to talk as well, but she decided it best not to break the flow between the two. 



Time passed and eventually they had to leave. In a day full of firsts for Maya, for the first time, she didn't want it to end. She wanted to stay and know more about Coco, she knew that there was so much she still didn't know about her experience. She wanted to talk with Mymy, who she still knew so little of, no doubt she had seen and experienced many things. Mymy had changed so much and Maya wanted to know every detail. There was so much Maya wanted to hear and say, but it couldn't be now.



As they stood up, Maya embraced Coco,

“Thank you so much” she said softly. 

Her sister's words almost caused Coco to cry as she reciprocated her embrace.



When the hug ended, Maya moved to Mymy for a hug.

“We need to plan something soon,” she said, loosening her arms.

“How about dinner tomorrow?” asked Mymy,

“I’ll send you the place. We can talk some more about your music” she said eagerly. 

As she walked back to her car. Maya wrestled with her strange emotions. She had dreaded this going in, she had started the morning with regret and anger. Now, she wished it didn't have to end. She realized that these people, while still somewhat strangers, loved her and truly did want to help her. 

When she got home, she sent Mymy and Coco her playlist. There was still a sense of anxiety in everything she did

*What if they Hate it? What if they hated talking with you? What if they hate YOU?* The thoughts were strong, and grew steadily. 

Then, she got a response:

Coco: Thanks Maya, I really enjoyed talking with you today! I can't wait to listen to this!

Mymy: I can't wait to listen to this either! I’m looking forward to having dinner with you tomorrow!

As if by magic, her thoughts dissipated, though her feeling of anxiety remained, it was weaker. She went to bed that night believing that, whatever may happen and whatever her doubts, her sisters were here to stay now, they were here to help her.  

Today was the first good day she had in a long time.

She drinks vodka. Chair on pack. Goodbyes. ""I hope you come back through here again sometime."" ""Thanks! Have a good one!"" ""You too!"" Bus stop. Cach bus that will effectively put me on the south end of Port Orange. 

Maps is telling me to stay on this bus, but it's a different bus number to get all the way to where I'm going. Look up route I'm on. It's nothing like the route I'm taking. But, it's following the maps route. 'Fuck it. Roll the dice.'

Turned out to be no big deal. I stayed on. The bus changed numbers at the transfer center automagically. An hour and twenty later... Gear up. Off bus. Cross intersection. Down the road a ways. 'This looks like a good spot.' Gear down. Thumb out.

Five minutes. Maybe. I wasn't keeping track. A truck changing lanes away from me turns back my way and pulls over. Backs up. Gear in the back. Me in the front. ""I hitchiked cross country once."" ""Nice!"" ""I'll take you to the end of the next town. It's a little farther than I'm going but it will be a better spot for you."" ""Awesome man! Thanks!"" We trade a couple hitchhiking stories. He takes me even farther than he said originally. Drops me in a spot in the shade, perfect car access, with a bench even. On pretty much the end of any civilization for another thirty miles. This might be the first time someone said they were gonna put me in a good spot and it was actually true! 

Me out. Gear out of truck bed. Thanks. Walk a few feet. Gear down. Thumb out. Check time. 4:21. 😆. After a while a guy comes walking toward me on the sidewalk. ""Do you need a votran pass?"" ""Nah man, I'm hitchhiking."" ""'Cause I've never had a good experience hitchhiking here."" ""Really?"" ""It seems like nobody around here wants to pick you up. It was easier in Ohio."" ""No shit?! Ohio was always a little slow for me."" ""Alright man. Take it easy!"" ""You too!"" Dude continues on his way. Thumb out. Just shy of forty minutes total wait time a truck pulls over.

""Watcha got in that pack?"" ""Some clothes. Chargers."" ""No weapons?"" ""No."" ""Ok. 'Cause I do have a weapon. Just so you know."" ""Cool."" Gear in. Me in. There's weapons. Tools to me. But in a pinch?

We chat. It turns out he only happened to be driving by me due to having lived in that area years ago. A last minute decision to cruise through the old stomping grounds is why we met. And he's driving through where I'm going. Not bad universe. Not bad. 

Dude's drinking a beer while we drive. ""I only allow myself one beer. And I don't care where I drink it."" Sure enough, he switched to water when he was done with it. He gave me a number for a maybe on some work down south.

Get dropped at a Publix. Woods nearby. Food. Out to woods. Find semi hidden entrance. 'Trail? Hmmm. It's used, but not like every day traffic used. Might as well check it out.' Down trail looking for spots. Here's a kinda tight one, but a look around tells me it's a good spot to drop my gear while I explore.

Down trail. Come up on a camp. Quick one-eighty. Back the way I came. Down an offshoot. Good enough spot for the night. Back to gear. Gear to spot. Tent. Gear in tent. Me in tent. Smoke...",68,1742087806.0,vagabond,32,0.97,False

1jca7kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1jca7kg/multiple_problems_need_emotional_support_and/,multiple problems need emotional support and logical advice before I go to my family about it,"so long story short, I moved to queens ny because of a new job I took. I became a flight attendant which took 6 weeks of unpaid training (longer story short my mom was a FA since I can remember and recently just became a pilot so ive been fully aware and prepared for the mental and physical load the job requires as I grew up with it)
before that I was living in miami with my mom, very comfortable working on my architecture degree which im still very passionate about. During training the give you a base and u have no choice but to start working out the base and then transfer later when theres openings. 

I got my second option NY, instead of miami my home but I figured it was do able since I have family in queens and my mom also had the same scenario happen to her, I was hopping on just getting a transfer 3 months into working and everything will be fine... right

I ended up really liking the job and the base cos of the trips I was going paris and london and all these new cities during the summer meeting my friends all over the world essentially living my 23rd yr old care free life. this carelessness ended up finding a boy and started dating him. after about 2 months of being together I find out im late and 5 weeks pregnant!

this kind of (obviously) made me freak out as (1) my job is really hard n has long weird hours 
(2) im looking for studios in queens and I already will be living in poverty (the first year of this job makes it really hard and people end up overworking themselves for that first year which I nowwww cannottttt do cos im pregnant)
(3) I just started dating him & im all pro choice but for my own sanity/beliefs I would not be able to get an abortion as it would go against my own morals and make me feel very empty for the rest of my life cos I know myself 

so thats the beginning of my pregnancy 
he essentially was very supportive of any decision I decided to take but I made it very clear to him that he did NOT need to be involved if he wasnt ready for it but I will be having the baby regardless. I would have preferred a dead beat dad who knew he wasnt ready for that responsibility than deal with an immature man who would just stress me out more.... but thats Just Me! thats why I mentioned that to him, he chose to stay by my side which made me feel better in many ways as also dealing with a dead beat would make any woman spiral but most persevere thru the pain and become awesome single moms (my mom as a huge example of it) 

I went from looking to a studio to him and I looking for a 1bdr which was its whole separate problem as he lives n works in jersey and I work from queens/bk n the ""middle"" would be manhattan which is impossible lol! I felt alone in the search and he was just back seat riding ""helping"" me look which as an emotional rollercoaster of a trimester FTM sent me livid and I was filled with anger and resentment and just felt like the responsibility was just on me.... which is exactly what I wanted to avoid.... after 3 months of looking I finally had to settle and move to jersey as I just gave up. he found a spot in jersey city that worked for us but it was STILL nyc price but way better living. so I just signed a lease and here we are. 

I kept working up until 30weeks which took soooo much out of me and I tried my best to keep working as something in me told me he wouldnt be able to handle the financial burden of the apt and living if I didnt. I am now 35 weeks (5 weeks into my unpaid leave) and I can tell he literally cannot afford rent and I literally cannot afford to even by groceries or eat out or even buy new underwear cos my last check went to the rent which he told me last minute if I could pay half and he would pay me back? this immediately started worrying me as that was supposed to be my savings for the next couple of months until my maternity pay kicked in. 

he has been working non stop of months now only have 1 day off each week. it makes me feel like I could do more sometimes, during the 2nd trimester I started cooking and cleaning more and working a little less while growing a baby. sometimes it would feel unfair other times I felt like I had no right to complain.

another form of resentment built up when instead of saving money and cutting back on expenses he found a hobby in furniture buying (which I get it we just moved into a space we need to decorate I studied design so I understand curating ur space is very important on ur mental health etc but it doesnt need to be an expensive couch or an expensive chair..... its our first apt??? it doesnt need to immediately be perfect especially with our situation.......) he would spend all his free time looking for furniture or playing video games. it would drive me insane as I has no time to do such things, my free time was spent cooking cleaning or going to dr appts and sleeping as I was always exhausted. it would make sense if he was looking for baby furniture or maybe just saving money for the baby but no. 

(this is where idk if im being dramatic or its just me being picky but am I crazy? am I overreacting?)

everytime I would mention babies are expensive and we really dont have the means to buy a coffee table as its not a necessity... a crib is a necessity... a stroller is a necessity... he would get bothered by it and it just makes me feel like somewhat controlling? he would say its his money that hes gonna be spending and I dont think he realized then that I will not be helping him or going 50/50 on rent and it will quite frankly be all on him... 

we have gotten into nasty fights because I have resentment built up & out of mood swings ive said some very fucked up things so he also has resentment towards me. 

im kind of in last couple of weeks of being pregnant and I am really thinking about leaving. he is not what I wanted from a partner and I love him but I feel like this whole thing is a mistake. not the baby I love my baby n I can't wait to meet him n the little feet tht kick me all the time. but the father isn't who I want to parent with. we dont share the same ideals about things, before him I wouldnt be on my phone at all I was always in a phone free environment n being human n talking to people n just living life. he spends all his time working or doom scrolling or playing a video game. constantly behind a screen just brain rotting away n ignoring his feelings n human experience 

i have gotten him to realize how much tht is affecting him but he doesnt really make an effort. 

I just feel like im doing a disservice to my future by staying but idk if I even have much of an option anymore? I have only an aunt up here in queens n thts it. no support system no friends new city no resources I feel dependent and stuck here. 
and if I tell my mom im leaving him she would gladly take me back home n help me figure it out but it will also bring custody battles with him as I would go back to miami n he would still be up here in jersey. part of me thinks tht would make the babies life harder as he wouldn't have a father figure present 24/7 n im also afraid of the courts ruling him full custody as my job requires me to be out of the house some nights... but he works so much he would just have to leave the baby with his grandma which love her but she has too many babies ij tht house n its not really the best environment id want for my baby :( 

I need logical reasonings n advice as my mom is also my ride or die so if I tell her these things she would look at him differently & get worried 

I kno theres potential for him to grow as a person n change his lifestyles n stuff but I know I cant rely on potentials. I love him but theres things tht just don't sit right with me n no matter how many heart to heart conversations we have it doesn't leave a lasting difference. 

I kinda need to make a decision soon as once I have the baby im stuck to tht state, if I have it here in jersey ill forever be stuck here, a place I barely like... im from south Florida where if ur bored u go to the beach n get a lot of sun all year round. here its different yes, but I just haven't acclimated yet maybe? idk im going insane n im tired of ranting ab it with friends or family as they never tell me any advice n I am looking for advice

He didn't know her very well, but he's having a hard time with it because his dad's been gone for a couple weeks being with her in her last days. My friend doesn't have a good relationship with his mom and he's been super cranky and irritated with his mom and been complaining about her for the last 2 weeks cause he's been stuck at home with her without his dad. So he's just irritable all around.

So anyway, I went over there to hangout with him. He was obviously not in a good mood, understandably, I didn't expect him to be. But, I felt like he was being rude and aggressive in a way.

-Telling me not to turn up the TV volume when I grabbed the remote even though I could BARELY HEAR IT. he said it's too loud.

-Saying me 'its people like you' bla bla bla (something about me and star wars???) because he was pissed about the Star Wars movie we were watching not being very good. So I said, I'm not into it either, should we change it? And he said no and looked so irritated at me for asking. Even though he was complaining about it for 10 minutes straight. 

-i asked if he was okay if I moved a chair to kick my feet up on since his recliners broken and he was like ""the coffee table is the exact same height as the chair"". Even though it wasn't, and the coffee table was all the way over where he was with his legs kicked up on it. So it made more sense to me to just move a chair instead of moving over the coffee table.

Anyway, I ended up just saying ""hey, I know you're feeling irritable for obvious reasons, and I kind of am too today, so maybe today's not the best day to hangout and we can get together again in a couple days"". And he just said FINE and pointed and the door. So I just grabbed my bag and started heading to the door. He said one more thing and I can't even remember what it was cause I was just seeing red and I just said ""you're being an asshole to me, so I'm leaving and I'll talk to you later"" and I kinda slammed the door and left.

Someone whose presence brings a sense of calm, safety, and intrigue, whose energy makes the world feel more expansive, and whose mind is as open and curious as their heart is explorative.

I’m not looking for something casual, anonymous, or fleeting. I want something that unfolds naturally - steady, reliable, and filled with the kind of depth that keeps us discovering each other over time. Distance and time zones aren’t a barrier to me; I care far more about the quality of what we build than the miles in between.

**Me**

I’m an attractive and intelligent woman who takes pride in both her work and personal life – although there is work that can be done in either; a woman who has achieved a relative balance of both, and who has worked relentlessly to get where she is.

I value and cherish today; we never know when life is going to change course.

I take care of myself- I love to be active, am naturally competitive, and love a really well prepared meal, a glass of wine, and a delicious pastry.

I am happy both in the mountains in the serenity of nature and in the city at a coffee shop, watching live music, or playing games with friends.

I seek both depth and lightness in conversation - moments that feel meaningful and intimate, an ability to be real and frank, and even playful humor and wit.

I believe in curiosity, in presence, and in the kind of comfort that makes even silences feel full. I am equally as happy spending a night in as a night out. But mornings, mornings I love. Sunrises, the quiet, and the still of a new day.

**You**

You are not a type, a mold version of a human that I envision in my brain before you show up. But…

You are established in your life, you know yourself well, and you reflect some level of the values I hold in high regard in your own life.

You are physically active, emotionally and intellectually intelligent, and have passion for life.

You are unattached - you are not married or separated and are able to put time and energy into embarking on whatever journey we find ourselves on.

You are kind, thoughtful, and unafraid to explore the depths of a connection. You believe in effort, in consistency, in the slow burn that turns into something undeniable.

You don’t rush things. You move with intention. You want something that feels both exhilarating and grounding, something worth the time it takes to create. You’re just as intrigued by a deep, late-night conversation as you are by the comforting presence of someone who just gets you.

**The Meet Cute**

If you are still reading and this resonates, introduce yourself in a way that lets me know you’re looking for the same things I am.

Share something real, something beyond the surface.

Perhaps share a photo (yes, you can send an imgur link with an initial chat) so I know who I am talking to – physical attraction does matter.

And if the connection is there, let’s take the step beyond anonymity – I’m not scared of last names, phone/voice calls, and real phone numbers...because some things deserve to exist in the real world, not just in words on a screen.",1,1742087227.0,r4r,1,0.6,False

I always wanted a Flylady-type system but it never worked for me so I made an alternative routine (after a ton of failed attempts) that’s simple and has been working FINALLY. The house feels thoroughly clean and I’ve been motivated to do it daily because it doesn’t take a long time. And the reward is no cleaning or laundry on the weekends, just M-F. And less resentment towards my husband. And waking up and feeling energized instead of drained. I kind of look forward to it too because it's fitting into my life. I try to do it right away in the morning. I set the timer for certain tasks and almost all take only 5-15 min (30 min max for the weekly task)

\* \* \* 

Schedule - What I've been doing on weekdays:

**> Dishes:** Unload and load every day (I race the coffee maker in the morning)


**> Laundry:** 1-2 loads daily - my trick is to make sure the 2nd load never needs to be folded and can stay in the dryer until tomorrow if I don’t have time (like towels, rags, pet stuff). Then I can get through the laundry at the beginning of the week and keep up and it only feels like 1 load because I’m leaving the 2nd load for tomorrow. If needed I’ll “refresh it” for a couple minutes in the morning while I put the new load in the washer.


**> Robot vac:** 1 floor/area every day. Makes me pick up the floor in those rooms, bonus! I dump it out and clear out the brush before I run it - only takes a minute if I do it daily. I keep the hair ripper/brush in a utility drawer near the garbage can.


**> 1 toilet, 1 sink:** I “swish and swipe” one bathroom M-W, Thursday I do the kitchen sink, Friday I check the bathrooms and touch up anything before the weekend.


**> 5-min toss:** I clear specific clutter-prone areas.

.

**> Weekly Task:** Takes 10-30 minutes each if I do it each week

**M -** **Carpet:** Deep vacuum carpet in specific area

**T - Bathrooms:** Dust, wipe surfaces, clean shower - in a different bathroom each week (toilets, sinks and steam-mopping floors are done in every bathroom each week on other days)

**W - Kitchen:** Disinfect counters and one other deep cleaning task in kitchen

**Th -** **Dust:** Dust ceiling to floor in one specific area

**F - Hardwood floors:** Vacuum/robovac area, then steam mop. I’ll do all bathroom floors one Friday (I use it to clean the walls around the toilets too), then kitchen/living area the next. Each area gets done twice per month and the basement steps are done on week 5 if it works out on the calendar).

.

**> Maintenance Task:**

**M - Meal prepping** (a couple of big meals with leftovers for the week)

**T - Mail, papers** (Toss and file)

**W - Garbage/Recycling** down to road

**Th - Order groceries** for the following week (Saves SO much time - I add groceries to my online cart instead of making a grocery list. If something isn’t right, I get an immediate refund. If I have to run inside for something to fix an issue, I’m just getting 1 item instead of 50.)

**Fr - Errands**

* Pick up groceries (Fridays are 4x fuel points) 
* Drop off donations 
* Pick up fresh dog food 
* Returns

⸻

1. Daily Intermittent Fasting (Best for Long-Term HSV Management)

✔ 16:8 or 18:6 Fasting (fast for 16-18 hours, eat within 6-8 hours)
✔ One Meal a Day (OMAD) (fast ~23 hours, eat in a 1-hour window)
✔ Drink plenty of water, herbal teas, and electrolyte-rich drinks (without sugar)

Why?
	•	Supports autophagy to help remove infected cells.
	•	Lowers inflammation (a key trigger for HSV reactivation).
	•	Does not cause significant immune suppression like prolonged fasting.

Example Schedule (16:8 Fasting)
	•	12 PM – 8 PM: Eating window
	•	8 PM – 12 PM (next day): Fasting window (only water, herbal tea, black coffee)
	•	Antivirals (if prescribed): Take during eating window to maximize absorption.

⸻

2. Short-Term Fasting for HSV Outbreaks (24-48 Hours)

✔ Best for early signs of an outbreak (tingling, itching, redness).
✔ Drink only water, herbal tea, black coffee, bone broth (if needed).
✔ Take antiviral medication (valacyclovir, acyclovir, famciclovir) to stop viral replication.

Why?
	•	Short fasts activate autophagy, which may help clear infected cells faster.
	•	Reduces inflammation that can trigger or prolong outbreaks.
	•	Allows for immune system reset while avoiding long-term immune suppression.

How to Do It:
	•	Start fasting at the first sign of an outbreak.
	•	Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration (which can stress the body).
	•	Take antivirals as prescribed (with minimal food, like a small protein source if necessary).
	•	Break the fast after 24-48 hours with a lysine-rich meal (see below).

⸻

3. What to Eat When Refeeding (Break the Fast Correctly!)

Key Nutrients to Prevent & Heal Outbreaks:
✔ High Lysine, Low Arginine Foods: Helps prevent HSV replication.
✔ Anti-inflammatory foods: Reduce outbreak severity.
✔ Immune-boosting nutrients: Support WBC recovery after fasting.

Best Foods to Eat After Fasting:
	•	High Lysine Foods (good for suppressing HSV)
	•	Wild-caught fish (salmon, cod, tuna)
	•	Poultry (chicken, turkey)
	•	Dairy (yogurt, cheese, kefir)
	•	Eggs
	•	Avocados
	•	Immune-Boosting Foods
	•	Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
	•	Garlic & onions (natural antivirals)
	•	Berries (high in antioxidants)
	•	Turmeric & ginger (anti-inflammatory)
	•	Avoid High Arginine Foods (Can Trigger HSV)
	•	Nuts & seeds (almonds, peanuts, cashews)
	•	Chocolate
	•	Wheat & oats
	•	Soy products

5. Supplements to Support Fasting & HSV Prevention

✔ L-Lysine (1,000-3,000 mg daily) – Blocks HSV replication.
✔ Zinc (30-50 mg daily) – Boosts immune response against viruses.
✔ Vitamin C (1,000 mg daily) – Reduces severity of outbreaks.
✔ Vitamin D (5,000 IU daily) – Supports immune health.
✔ Probiotics – Helps gut health, which plays a role in immunity.

⸻

6. Lifestyle Habits to Pair with Fasting

✔ Manage Stress – Stress triggers HSV, and fasting raises cortisol levels. Use meditation, breathing exercises, or light exercise.
✔ Get Enough Sleep – Lack of sleep weakens immunity, increasing outbreak risk.
✔ Avoid Overexertion – Extreme exercise during fasting can stress the body too much.

⸻

7. Final Recommendations

✔ Intermittent fasting (16:8 or OMAD) daily for ongoing HSV management.
✔ 24-48 hour fasts at the first sign of an outbreak to stop viral replication.
✔ Antiviral medication during refeeding to maximize absorption and effect.
✔ Avoid arginine-rich foods, especially during fasting and outbreaks.
✔ Prioritize lysine, zinc, and vitamin C when breaking the fast.

⸻

Conclusion
	•	Short fasting + antivirals may help suppress HSV outbreaks faster.
	•	Intermittent fasting is safe long-term and can reduce inflammation, a key trigger for HSV.
	•	Prolonged fasting (5+ days) should be used cautiously to avoid immune suppression.
	•	Proper refeeding with lysine and immune-boosting foods is critical to preventing outbreaks.
