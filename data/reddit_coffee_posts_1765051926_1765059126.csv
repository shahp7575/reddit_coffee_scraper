It’s the end of the year, which means things tend to be a lot looser than usual and emotions can run high.

It’s never unusual for commentators and journalists to receive messages from those they are analysing, opining and reporting about, but it tends to ramp up as the parliamentary year draws to a close.

The end of the year means nothing but a calendar flip, but the idea of flopping over a mental full stop, even if nothing actually stops, seems to appeal to politicians, in particular. It also means that they tend to take things a little more personally than usual. Perhaps we all do.

At the very least, I was more amused than usual at receiving two messages, almost simultaneously, from both Labor and Liberal figures essentially asking why I was being so “mean” about their side of politics.

These messages appeared at the same time as Carly Simon was singing *You’re so vain* in my ear (I have the musical taste of a boomer who lived in a van, dodged the draft and got lost at Woodstock for a few years before ending up in Laurel Canyon), which made it more amusing, at the time. Yes, you probably DO think this column is about you.

It says something about the state of politics in Australia when both parties feel under attack. To which, as always, the response has to be – imagine how their constituents feel.

The Liberals are lost and unlikely to make it out of the wilderness anytime soon, if ever. But their ideas live on.

In its bid to become the “natural party of government” (whatever that actually means), Labor has filled the policy arena usually taken up by Liberal Party thought bubbles. Recent examples include, but not limited to – what if we revolutionised work and society with new technology but didn’t regulate it? What if we had environment laws that made it easier to approve mining projects? What if we had donation reform that locked out independents and minor parties from election funding? What if we gave billions and billions for an insecure, no-guarantees defence deal but paid for it by shredding the social contract and cutting NDIS funding?

Labor has the space to do what it wants – and what it wants, apparently, is to be the Liberal Party of the 1990s.

But that doesn’t mean all is lost.

Labor’s leadership might be doing all it can to stick to the “middle of the road” incrementalism path that Anthony Albanese set it on in 2019, but that doesn’t mean everyone is on board.

You can see that in some of the breakaways. Ed Husic was one of the loudest voices in pushing for Labor to change its gas strategy, but he wasn’t alone.

There is a moodiness to the electorate that MPs who spend time with their communities would have to wilfully ignore to not notice. In the past couple of months, the number of stakeholders using the word “arrogant” about their dealings with the government and senior staff has risen. The hubris has begun to creep in – that’s not unusual in a second term with an increased majority (in this case, a thumping one) but that it’s spilling out across stakeholders usually means it’s just one step away from hitting the public.

At one recent event where I mentioned this growing sense of arrogance, three lobbyists each approached me afterwards to say they’d personally seen the shift. That has some in the government who haven’t been entirely choked by the Kool-Aid worried. But worried enough to make change?

Paul Sakkal’s recent *Sydney Morning Herald* news break on [Labor looking to move forward on an east coast gas reservation](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/labor-set-to-make-major-intervention-to-keep-gas-in-australia-20251203-p5nkja.html), just six months after Peter Dutton attempted to take it to the electorate as a hail Mary shows that the leadership can be made to bend, if the public scares it enough.

Because that is always what moves politicians – fear. Fear they’ll lose the electorates, their jobs, their futures, with not enough time to reverse opinion.

Those fears, or at least concerns, within Labor are growing. Not that it will lose government – on the numbers, the Coalition winning the next election is as likely as me being named the next Bond girl – but that it will lose more seats than first anticipated.

There are about 18 nervous backbenchers who have decided they quite like their jobs. A summer in their electorates, hearing directly from those who put them there, and not what their party leaders are telling them are wins, should at least give them pause.

Because if Labor is to act at all on what needs to be done, then it only has next year. The year after that is straight back into election mode, when reforms tend to be short term and even shorter-sighted.

A gas reservation seems a small start. But not enough to win back the votes of the disappointed – and, worse, the disillusioned. If both parties are filling the same space, then scare campaigns that criticism will bring only a lost government loses any bite.

Addressing needs as they are, and not as the government sees them, doesn’t have to be clouds in your coffee. As the year winds down and the fever of the parliamentary year starts to break, you have to wonder how many in the government are starting to worry about the winds of change.

1pg1hx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pg1hx2/i_33m_got_my_lady_27f_flowers_35_times_one_month/,"I (33M) got my lady (27F) flowers 3-5(?) times one month! Good? Nope. She said because she had to trim and vase them, unless I did that too, I was giving her a chore…","And my reaction to that was “okay no more fucking flowers ever for you then you ass hole.” Like what the fuck you mean I’m giving you a chore cause you have to put them in a fucking vase? Has anyone ever heard of this reaction ?! Can someone reading who relates to that mindset PLEASE, please, explain. 

Every single time, I felt like I was giving her a gift with love. It’s corny, but I still feel like giving flowers is a very romantic gesture and it’s an expression of love, fondness, and like an admiration of beauty. Flowers are so versatile too there’s so many reasons. 

Having to do with expressing love, they’re given for Valentine’s Day (lame), Mother’s Day (fine), Weddings (cool). But those are all so-so. They’re days where we were taught you gotta give flowers or have flowers. They still mean something of course. Love is love. BUT…

The BEST flowers someone can give someone imo are the, “hey I just love you and love making you happy so much and I want to see you smile because it enriches my fucking oxygen” flowers. Those flowers hit so good. The holidays, people know why they’re getting flowers. 

The best flowers anyone can receive are the ones that make the recipient ask “why?”

It’s (hopefully) because the sender by needed you to remember that there’s not a reason. There is every reason. When someone truly is your everything, I believe you need to make sure you show that person that they are your everything. 

I loved making her happy so much. So much so that she didn’t even have to try to make me happy because making her happy made me so fucking happy. For years. For a while. And that’s a huge issue of course a huge issue. Because it sometimes made my gestures less pure because I wanted/needed some sort of reaction because gratitude was the only gesture/expression of love I felt I was receiving. They were always done with love, but as sickening as it feels to type, I was giving desperate flowers, needy flowers, did-I-do-good flowers, am-I-good-boy flowers, and tell-me-I-matter-to-you flowers.  

We were together for 5 years and it felt like ‘appreciation’ became ‘assumption’. With everything. Every gesture. It wasn’t “thank you for doing that,” it was just “yeah that’s what you do, of course.” All the little things like making coffee for her and getting glasses of water for us before bed - she just knew those were taken care of. Those were “the things he does.” Which I truly wouldn’t mind, but when I thought about it and asked her, there were no “the things she does.” There were also only me chores - that only I do cause she didn’t want to do them. But zero her chores … oh wait, silly me. She had to go through the terrible inconvenience of displaying my tedious expression of love.

Eventually the gestures were sullied when there was barely a thank you. And I didn’t hide that I felt this way. I shared it and expressed it bothered me and made me not want to do things when I felt taken for granted and never reciprocated. Multiple times I brought this up. But never a real effort to show/give me more. 

AND THEN WITH THESE FUCKING FLOWERS - she said it was a chore. To me that completely took my desire to get her flowers away ever again and actually completely changed the way I feel about her and was absolutely a nail in the coffin. 

There have been a lot of issues over the years with just myself feeling unappreciated when I feel I think I’m being thoughtful. But this is one that I just like remember most days. 

As a man, I’m likely not alone in saying, I have never received flowers. But countless times I have:

- Thoughtfully taken time and browsed on flowershop websites
-  Sifted through grocery store arrangements to find the best I could find (and rip the price tag off of it before I get home)
- pay for them with money that’s never been weaker
- make sure they make it home safely (keeping vases upright or laying bouquets down safely)
- walked them in stealthily behind my back to surprise, to make happy, to see a smile, to make them forget about what’s bothering them right now, and let them know there’s someone in their life that loves them and will go out of there way for them. 

BUT Snipping the stems a little and putting them in a vase with water and the little flower Ramen flavoring pack … THAT’S TOO LABORIOUS? It gives me a feeling that doesn’t require deep thought or lofty phrasing. When my expression of love, after years of expressing it thoroughly and deeply, becomes a fucking chore to you, simply put:

1pg1hka,https://www.reddit.com/r/FNaF/comments/1pg1hka/my_own_version_of_plot_for_fnaf_2_movie/,My own version of plot for fnaf 2 movie,"I m neither a producer not had any experience in writing. I thought my own version of this movie and want to share it with u, there are some details and changes are needed to apply.

 Firstly how would I start this: Some rich people want to reopen the Freddy Fazbear cafe as there are a lot of potential in it,therefore there are some renovations going there and it is the first encounter with the animatronics where plumbers notice that the animatronic bonny has moved from his initial position, despite the fear for a moment they just consider it as nothing special. And the opening of the movie; the new hired guard( as the cafe is being renovated, no one would want some crazy teenagers hanging around and doing financial damage)who sits at his desk which is in fnaf 2, watching through cameras and drinking his coffee. As he want to turn off the cameras, he notices there is no trace of Bonnie(or chica), he thinks that some crazy ass teenagers sucked in and are just pranking him, he goes to check it, as he moves there shouting in order for teenagers leave the territory; however there is no teenagers or thieves and suddenly he sees bonnie at the end of the corridor approaching him and saying "" how did u get here"", suddenly freadbear approaching behind him while there is a terror in guards eyes, he slowly turns back and fast movement from Freddy s side by which he breaks guard's neck marionette behind Freddy putting her hand on his shoulder, this is the opening of the movie.

Now main part, mike learns about the renovation of this place and understands that it is the best if to keep this secret from abby however she learns about it on the internet by sudden social media post. Meanwhile new owners of this cafe didn't give much of an attention to the disappearance of the guard pointing out that he just got scared and ran away, anger instead of interest.
In the morning after dropping abby at the school,mike drives to that place and tries to enter the place but he can't as the every door and window which he checked is closed and as he wants to leave he sees the piece of old newspaper and written in bold and big shrift:murder on it on the wall(as in the movie itself) takes it and leaves in a hurry as he is going to meet vanessa for lunch, instead of warm greetings he seems to be concerned and scared, Vanessa notices the strange behavior and starts asking questions where mike breaks and tells her everything and how he is concerned that Abby will learn about that, therefore after the lunch Vanessa tells mike not to be worried that much and he needs to go home , make some meal for Abby. Instead of going home herself, she drives straight to that pizzeria and breaks the lock while no one sees by entering the place. She doesn't see anything special while investigating,however sometimes hearing strange sudden sounds but she addresses that as lack of sleep. As she keeps investigating she meets the turned off animatronics but continues. As she didn't find anything extra ordinary, she goes to the exit when suddenly she hears the fast steps behind her, turns back and sees guard masked as marionette running towards her and yeah she gets captured(in my version of plot, vanessa only knows Charlotte thought the newspaper and doesn't have any clue that this marionette is that kid from the murder case back in 80 s).
At the school Abby spends her time with her only friend and talk about the local festival where there are going to be a lot of kids and parents, however she is not fully concentrated as all she can think is that pizzeria, after the classes she calls mike telling him that she has extra robotics classes after school so he would pick her up 1-2 hours later as she goes to the pizzeria to find her friends, when she arrives she opens the main door which is not locked because earlier Vanessa broke the lock, marionette in guards body seeing her through cams how she is seeking for her friends as animatronics and seeing Vanessa being very reactive to her appearance, Charlotte connects the dots and realizes that they're connected which will continue like in the movie where she uses abby as leverage in order to get the code out Vanessa) but the main difference is that Vanessa learns about Charlotte after, she asks marionette why is she doing this? And marionette s reply is that the killer's daughter should know better where the conversation develops in the phase where vanessa remembers the fragments from her childhood where she remembers the conversation of her dad and mom about this death of the girl and says that marionette is the that girl from that incident day and the scene with the Charlotte s story in the beginning of the original movie plays but here Charlotte is using her words to describe that days event and at the end blames all parents being so mad at them. While there is the intense conversation going between Charlotte and Vanessa chica and abby have already been united and having great time after which chica says to her that she needs her help with the code on the computer and the like in the original movie Vanessa tells the code and Abby inserts the code.

Meanwhile mike is meeting that guy who put the posters on the wall through the contact details as he had 2 hours of which abby was supposed to be at the class, where he learns about that guy's daughter being actually killed that day and this incident being covered up and tells him the story of his brother. After having dramatic and heart breaking conversation, mike leaves to pick up his sister and tells that guy that they will be in touch and he shouldnt be alone.

When he arrives at school to his great shock he learns that there are no extra robotics classes and immediately realizes that Abby went to the pizzeria,thereby jumping in the car and driving to freddy Fazbear's pizzeria. While he drives, marionette has already full control even outside the pizzeria and takes Bonnie, freddy and prototypes and leaves chica with abby so she wouldn't leave her out of sight and still had laverage over Abby so Vanessa wouldn't do anything to stop Charlotte s evil plan. When leaving she sees the poster about the festival.

When Mike arrives he finds Vanessa tied up in the locker(like in the movie) and unties her while chica has already detected mike and offers abby to play hide and seek meanwhile going after mike and Vanessa. After finding them Vanessa says to Mike that he should run to the computer so he could turn off the chica. He runs to the computer trying to turn off chica and when chica wants to make final blow at Vanessa abby appears shouting, when chica turns back and goes towards Abby, mike manages to turn it off. Vanessa and Abby come to Mike and she offer to Mike to try to turn off other animatronics but it seems to be impossible as the wave range is to short to control them and they re controlled by marionette herself. When they leave they see half ripped apart poster about festival and vanessa realize where Charlotte is headed as she knows that marionette hates parents.

Firstly they leave abby at neighboors as it is too dangerous for her to go there while mike and Vanessa are headed out to the festival.

Meanwhile the animatronics are walking around the festival and everyone considers them to be just mascarade and nothing else, while they re actually cold blood thirsty animatronics controlled by marionette. And fun begins, marionette approaches one drunk parent while he laughs at her face, and suddenly Bonnie comes from behind crushing man's head which causes chose around, everybody runs for his or her life while animatronics are attacking people. When Vanessa and Mike arrives they see these whole charade and run towards it, while Vanessa tries to rescue people from animatronics by leading them to exit, mike is trying to find the weak points of these animatronics and even manages to cut the main cabel of foxy when he almost swinged at the couple which immediately stops him. And we pass to Abby where she says that she needs to go to the bathroom,even though neighbor doesn't want to let her go, he agrees but instead of toilet she sneaks out of the window and runs away. Then we see Abby in front of marionette trying to stop her from commiting this bloody event, and Charlotte laughs and says that she was a gullible girl like Abby and that she learnt it the hard way and telling her to get out of her way but Abby refuses that's when marionette swings to off abby, unexpectedly chica s old prototype hold marionette but she manages to disable chica and moves towards Abby but there is the key character appearing, Charlotte s dad holding the music box. Marionette immediately stops and says in calm and exactly in Charlotte s voice-dad? He hugs Charlotte in marionette s form and they have very dramatic moment where all of that rage inside Charlotte releases in intense emotions where she cries and tells her dad that she didn't intend to do all of this and her dad calms her down holding her hand. Suddenly all of the animatronics stops, and Charlotte s soul alongside other animatronics s souls, where she tells her dad goodbye while he holds marionette and cries in pain and abby and chica moment afterwards. The kids soul leave in peace.

The police couldn't find any explicible explanation to this chaos and deaths, therefore they close the case as unsolved thinking that there was an evil orchestrater who remotely controlled the animatronics.

Mike and Vanessa started dating after that gathering into the family of 3 living their lives in peace.

The final moment, we see Springtrap alone in the closed room around rubbish, the cameras points to his black eyes and suddenly they turn on, and black screen and voice "" I always come back!"", end


About the moment with Charlotte and her dad, it needs more writing and drama which I wrote, I just was tired didn't want to add more details

Like the option to switch to walking mode to get more gems or other stuff, maybe even badges for miles walked? It would be policed by speed, so you cant just turn it on in a car unless you are literally driving walking speed.

Ways to bypass ads? Simply cause a lot of the ads (currently the dose coffee thing for me) that just dont fucking work- if be down with spending like a hundred gems or some shit to bypass an add or two.

Neighbor war games. Some sort of way to play games with ppl near your parcels. Or in your town. Maybe the bigger league ppl can lose or gain parcels through the games? (I say bigger accounts simply cause it's not gonna take them a year to gain it back of its lost ig)

Adding more to land! A way to edit stuff perhaps? Skins? Animals? Anything other then grass and trees and trees? Ik the other types of parcels exist but like lemme decorate my own home or somthin XD

Animals. I think it would be neat to see a few animals roaming around, maybe collect them? Idfk what they would be for exactly but like, its just open bland land. Lets add stuff to it!

I feel like I'm the opposite of that — I've never fainted, never had any kind of psychotic/hallucinogenic/supernatural experience.

I'll preface this by saying I've struggled with substance abuse since a very young age, and I'm not trying to glorify drug use — I use drugs to cope with the pain of my existence, to be frank.

I have an extremely high tolerance to nearly every drug I've tried, and even at high doses drugs don't hit me as hard as they hit others.

I am a true social smoker — I've smoked plenty of cigarettes in my life, but I've *never* felt addicted. I really only feel the effect of nicotine if I'm drunk. I have experimented with nicotine gum, using it for long periods and quitting cold turkey with zero side effects.

Same with caffeine, while I do drink coffee daily, caffeine doesn't have a major effect on me, and I have quit caffeine cold turkey with zero side effects many times.

I've never blacked out from drinking despite drinking HEAVILY as a teen, and when I do get drunk, I don't get real loose and silly like some people. I feel alcohol for sure, but I could pass for sober if you get what I mean.

I'm an opioid addict (on methadone), and I've never ""nodded"" despite doing large doses. Opioids just make me feel more normal.

Nitrous oxide sends some to people to another universe; whilst it's enjoyable for me, again, I am still grounded in reality.

The one drug that hits me hard is cannabis. I used to get major anxiety and negative thought loops from cannabis — cannabis feels very psychedelic for me.

1pg1e6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1pg1e6w/how_it_started_versus_how_its_going/,How it started versus how it's going.,"TL;DR:

* How it started - My first direct report tells me on day 1 that this is his facility, that anything I want to change has to be approved by him first, and that I was his ""assistant""
* How it's going - I have never once asked for his approval on anything and he gets his own coffee. He's losing his office, taking a significant pay cut, and the majority of his staff is being taken away from him.

So first a little backstory. I am a first time manager who was hired as the Ops Manager at my facility. I was an internal candidate from another location and my prior reputation was enough to put me over for it despite not having the experience. Prior to me, the whole facility was ran by a single Supervisor. For almost 2 years he had a team of about 12 direct labor and had no other support staff(not even HR). Now we're up to around 40 direct labor, we're hiring support staff, and our production targets have increased over 400%.

This Supervisor has had an extremely hard time accepting the fact that he's not the top dog anymore. In our first one-on-one I started talking about some changes that needed to happen. He interrupted me to say, ""Let me stop you right there. Anything you want to change has to be approved by me first, you're here to assist me"". I maintained my calm demeanor and didn't say anything, but afterwards I went straight to call my boss at the home office. I made it clear that I wasn't asking him to intervene, but I wanted to make sure I didn't misunderstand the role and that him and the Supervisor didn't have some kind of under the table agreement. He assured me that wasn't the case and that it was my facility and I had sole decision making power. I vented a little bit to him about how I felt the Supervisor was undermining me, but he put my mind at ease. I am a pretty self aware person so I convinced myself that this was just my own imposter syndrome at work. I put my nose to the grindstone and went to work.

In the 4 months since I took the job I have remained consistent and assertive, and overall things in the plant have gotten much better across the board. The attendance and PPE policies are being enforced where they weren't before, we've started implementing 5S and a good Safety Culture, and general cleanliness and organization has gotten much much better among a multitude of other improvements. Every time someone visits from the parent facility they all gush over how much better the place has been running since I took over.

However, recently some employees and the Team Leads have started venting to me about some frustrations they have with the Supervisor. Things like him playing favorites, not enforcing rules fairly, and undermining their efforts as well as my own to bring about my vision for the plant. In a casual discussion with the Team Leads today, I could tell they were dancing around some things and being a little cagey so I finally asked point blank, ""What's going on around here that I don't know about?"". 

They told me that early on in my tenure, the Supervisor was going around telling employees that they didn't have to listen to me. That this was his shop, and we were going to keep doing things his way. They did acknowledge that he has gotten better about that but even as recently as a couple of weeks ago he allegedly made the statement to a group of employees that ""kcox1980 isn't your boss, I am"". (I say allegedly because I'm not blind to the possibility that these guys could be exaggerating or trying to kiss up a little, but it is still a little validating to hear that I wasn't completely crazy in my earlier feelings.) I have noticed a few things here and there myself, so in a recent Town Hall I included a slide that showed the Org Chart and fully explained the roles of myself, the Supervisor, and the Team Leads. They told me he wasn't very happy about that. Oh well.

Anyway, none of that matters because by pure coincidence some major changes are coming soon and not much of it is any of my personal doing. This is all part of upper management's long term strategy for us. I will remain as the Ops Manager(obviously because I'm crushing it), but we are hiring 2 additional Supervisors and splitting up the team between the 3 of them. We're also adding several more support staff that will take on the workload that is currently keeping the Supervisor in his office about 90% of the time. No other Supervisors in the entire company have an office, this role is meant to be floor level, front-line leadership, but since he used to be a one man show they let him have one.

Other than that first conversation with my boss, I haven't brought any of these issues to him or anyone else in upper management, so none of this is directly related to the performance of the Supervisor. The only real input I had on this new structure was that I was adamant that the current Supervisor had to be dead even in status with the new ones across the board, meaning level of responsibility, status in the org chart, and pay structure. The long and short of it is that he's going to lose his office, be transitioned to salary instead of hourly(he's currently getting about 20-30 hours/week in overtime but this will be eliminated by spreading out the workload before the transition), and more than half of his direct reports will be given to the other Supervisors. My boss is visiting the facility next week and we're going to meet with the Supervisor to go over all this with him. I am very curious to see how he's going to take it.

1pg1cnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pg1cnq/my_date_stole_my_underwear_or_he_didnt/,"My date stole my underwear, or he didn’t?","Background information, I am a very tidy and detailed person, I have a specific order for every clothing I own and have different clothing sections for different occasions as well. So I notice smt immediately if somebody moved them around.

One day I invited this guy over to my place, we’ve been going on dates more than 5 times, he is super respectful, no touching (not even holding hands), he charged his phone and called an Uber for himself that’s it. During this short time he used my washroom once. After he left, I checked my washroom, and noticed one of my summer season underwear was gone (I don’t touch this section unless it’s summer but it’s winter now). I thought I just have been busy and accidentally made a mistake, so I didn’t think too much about it.

4 days after that night, we went to a restaurant together again, after that we grabbed some alcohol and chilled in my place a bit again. Same with last time, he was super respectful about everything. At the end of our date before he left, he told me he likes me and doesn’t wanna move too fast, because he is uncomfortable with physical touch unless we really start to love and trust each other. I respect his decision and found him to be a pretty respectful person overall. However, in the morning when I woke up and used the washroom, I found the summer underwear I found missing was back again— in the exact place where it supposed to be! There is no way I made a mistake, because firstly I didn’t touch these underwear since 4 days ago, Two because I checked 4 days ago my memory was very vivid about how they looked like.

I am so confused and scared. Is it possible he stole it from me? But that contradicts with what he told me and how he acted around me this whole time. I implied this situation with him, he told me, it could be somebody entered my room and did it (I sometimes don’t lock the door when I just go to my neighbourhood for groceries or coffee, that’s true). But this just happened during the exact time he visited my place? ",1,1765058638.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1pg1bya,https://i.redd.it/mo9w440epn5g1.jpeg,Week 1–4 (Progress & Review),"Hi everyone! I wanted to share my 4-month update with Hers now that I’ve officially completed my last week at 8 units and will be moving to 16 units next. I’ve learned SO much from all of your posts, so it felt right to give back and hopefully help someone else who’s starting out.

Starting Stats
Starting weight: 170 lbs
Current weight (Dec 6, 2025): 156.6 lbs

Dosing schedule prescribed:
Weeks 1–4: 8 units
Weeks 5–8: 16 units
Weeks 9–12: 32 units
Week 13+: 48 units

WEEK 1: Did I just inject AIR?? 😭

I decided to take my first dose on a Saturday after reading everyone’s advice here. I had a normal high-protein breakfast (2 eggs + coffee), waited 30 minutes, and… attempted my first injection.

It was a mess. 😂
I followed the instructions but couldn’t see the medication in the syringe, and yep—I injected air. My gut told me something was off, so I grabbed another syringe, ignored the app instructions, and finally did it correctly… 40 minutes later.

Immediately after injecting, I felt super faint. For context, I live alone (33 y/o with a very supportive cat 🐈‍⬛), and I was SO nervous. I’m 99% sure it was a panic response, not the medication. I spent the whole weekend lightheaded.

Sat–Sun: Lightheaded but stable
Mon–Tues: Normal
Wed–Thurs: Diarrhea (bad)
Fri: Normal again

BUT the appetite impact? Instant.
Food noise was gone by that same afternoon. Cravings disappeared. As a professor with stress-eating tendencies, this felt like magic.

WEEK 2: Hello, flu-like side effects.

Took my second dose early Saturday with just coffee (probably a mistake). Had pho in the afternoon and felt terrible afterward—body aches, headache, chills, so tired. It honestly felt like catching a cold.

Symptoms lasted Saturday + Sunday.

The rest of the week: totally normal.
No diarrhea, no heartburn.

WEEK 3: Thanksgiving (aka the week I feared I’d gain everything back)

This dose landed during Thanksgiving, and I was really nervous about overeating. I drove 400 miles to see family and was shocked by what happened:

I physically could not finish a normal Thanksgiving plate. I got satisfied halfway through, which has NEVER happened in my life. I’ve always been either starving or uncomfortably full—never “just right.”

Only side effect: two days of intense heartburn.

Because I had to drive back, I took my dose a day early (Friday), and surprisingly— NO side effects at all this week

WEIGHT PROGRESS
Start: 170 lbs
Today: 156.6 lbs

Thanksgiving week was the slowest (understandably), but the trend has been steady and encouraging. I’m not exercising right now—my schedule is wild and I’m constantly moving from class to class, so I’m never really sitting. But as I move into 16 units, I want to start adding light workouts.
*see screenshot below*

MEDICAL CHECK-IN
I did talk to my doctor before starting. She sent me to the lab just to make sure everything was normal, which gave me peace of mind.

FINAL THOUGHTS ❤️
I know so many of us feel alone in this journey. I definitely did at first—living by myself, overthinking every weird symptom. But this community made me feel supported and informed.

Weight loss has always been tied to my self-esteem in complicated ways, but for the first time, I’m seeing progress that feels steady, realistic, and empowering. I even pulled out old clothes I never thought I’d fit into again—such an amazing feeling.

Thank you all for sharing your experiences. You truly made a difference in mine. 💕",2,1765058587.0,HersWeightloss,1,1.0,False

**ep1 Little Green Men**

https://preview.redd.it/tajt6vc5nn5g1.jpg?width=3021&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=667a9e5eced977a982f6caf55045906bf23aa245

* She wanted to meet just to see if he was ok 🥺 and her stroking his hair omg. He’s like a sad puppy.
* I love that he attempts to do an official body examination on Jorge as if prepping for an autopsy. Feels like something he picked up from Scully. And he speaks into the recorder as if he’s speaking to her. She’s had an impact on how he approaches these things.
* *”I can only trust you. And they’ve taken you away from me.*” Ouch 😭 These two cannot be kept apart, it’s not healthy.

**ep4 Sleepless**

* Mulder being rude and anti-social right away to a new partner lmao! He only wants one partner and we all know who that is. (He acts so charming and cute with her, but no wonder he has no friends if that’s how he acts to everyone else)
* Them dragging out their phone call not wanting to stop talking. OUCH. Top tier moment right there.

**ep5 Duane Barry**

* Amazing episode, great performances from everyone.
* I love that even though the head of the hostage rescue team didn’t like Mulder at first she still calls him to make sure he knows about what they found in Duane.
* I don’t really buy that Scully would be so easily physically overpowered, she’s a trained FBI agent. He doesn’t look very strong, how did he overtake her and get her in the car without neighbors hearing that?

**ep6 Ascension**

* Mulder is usually clean-shaven and here he’s not. Good character detail to show that he is not caring about anything, not taking care of himself, except finding Scully.
* Please don’t spoil for me, but I really hope Krycek becomes on “their side” eventually, like becomes a genuine friend and ally. Maybe there will be an episode where he’s ordered to harm them in some way and he refuses, choosing to help them instead. Idk, but that’s my hope for the character right now. Gimme a good redemption arc! I have a sense for these things and I feel one coming.

* It makes me giggle when the location says a place on the east coast and it’s so clearly the PNW. I’ve lived in the PNW my whole life and recognize those landscapes immediately. “Virginia” yeah sure.

https://preview.redd.it/mvdfed0lnn5g1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=724df10bb5e5d88ffd39b28e6fb396fd43bd51ee

* Absolutely heartbreaking seeing Mulder lose his temper like that. Witnessing just how much Scully means to him is incredibly impactful. I believe this is the most upset we’ve seen him thus far. He goes around putting on a somewhat aloof and cool exterior all the time but all that is broken down now. Really good performance.
* He must feel so conflicted because he really wants to believe aliens are real BUT if that’s true they could be hurting Scully amd he doesn’t want to believe that of course. The very thing he so desperately wants to believe is real and true might be hurting his partner and that must be tearing him up inside. It would be better to think Barry is just a psycho holding her somewhere on earth where he can find her, even if that means the aliens aren’t real. He did a great job portraying that inner conflict during the interrogation scene, asking if Duane hurt her, insisting that he just saw a helicopter, etc.
* Last episode when Mulder was talking to the hostage rescue lady he said “Wanna know what they do to a woman’s ovaries?” and I LITERALLY said in one of my posts before that no line of dialogue is random. They’re gonna fuck with her ovaries or something and cause permanent damage. FUCK. I can’t believe how much darker this season is. However, the tech being used on her did not look alien at all, it looked totally human-made.
* He called Krycek “Alex” instead of his last name, which means he trusts him, or wants to trust him. That’s so sad lol.

**ep7 3**

* Vibes are off without Scully
* Where’s Buffy when we need her?
* Nah this episode just pissed me off. Especially when I found out the actress was his real life girlfriend at the time. One episode without Scully and they give him an entire episode to bang a hot vampire-wannabe chick who’s his girlfriend? ICK. Weird, unecessary, and cringe.

**ep8 One Breath**

* Fucking horrible seeing Scully in that state.
* The “thank you for not smoking sign” HAHA. I don’t know what to think of Skinner yet but that was very sassy.
* The scene between Mulder and Smoking Man was intensely powerful. I’ve watched a lot of great tv shows in my life and I love those moments early on when you just sort of feel that the show is special. I wonder how viewers in 1994 reacted to that scene, or is there a specific episode/moment where original fans agree the show “leveled up”? I feel like this has to be one of them, surely. A character who’s been mostly silent and lurking in rooms with such aura and audacity sitting alone in a sad apartment drinking beer and smoking himself to death saying “*don’t threaten me, I’ve watched presidents die.*” Brilliant. Does he have a death wish due to the weight of what he’s seen/done and that’s why he smokes so much? Does he want to die and he’s doing it slowly to punish himself? Just a theory.
* Mulder’s been on the verge of a total mental breakdown and his reaction when she wakes up is “I just came by to say hi”???? Excuse me wtf? Was he acting all aloof cause her family was there? Was expecting a bit more from that moment.

**ep10 Red Museum**

* I’ve been waiting for an episode to link back to a previous storyline and I love how this one did. At first I was like oof portraying vegans as culty psychopaths is an interesting choice but then it exploded way beyond that into something completely different and turns out the vegan cult is not a part of the harm being done at all. I loved it.

**ep11 Excelsis Dei**

* Well this episode certainly wasn’t a good look for Mulder or for anything really. Suddenly he’s all sceptical and unbelieving about the mystery and saying “she made it up to get out of her job” and Scully’s the one throwing out the unusual possibilites and hypotheses and acting eager to find out what happened? Why were their roles suddenly reversed this episode? And it was super dark to hear that there are other X Files involving rape and he says they’re all “unsubstantiated” claims, says a man who takes a shoddily edited photo of a UFO as factual evidence, is instantly willing to believe in werewolves, etc. This all felt very out of character for Mulder. He’s been shown over and over to be compassionate and believing victims’ stories before, now suddenly he’s not? Awful episode, worse than Space lmao. I actually paused about 30 minutes in to make coffee and didn’t even want to continue. Terrible writing. I will pretend this one doesn’t exist.

**ep13 Irresistable**

* I’m so impressed by the scene with Scully going to see the FBI counselor. The cases having tangible emotional/psychological impacts on them has been sort of ignored so far so this was really needed. Just seeing that the FBI has that resource was really nice.
* It makes sense why this case would disturb her so much, as someone who performs autopsies which we’ve seen her do multiple times. An autopsy is like giving a human body its last moments of respect and care, and a crime involving desecrating bodies for personal pleasure is the complete opposite of that.
* Scully crying??? That was so hard to watch. But it’s like she was able to finally break down a barrier of showing weakness to other people. And WE know that Mulder of course will not think less of her for showing “weakness,” he will not think she is too emotional or cannot perform her job. He will be there for her when she needs him, just as she will be there for him. But like, can Scully catch a fucking break please? How about Mulder gets kidnapped or hospitalized for once?
* Some rambling about their relationship: A man and woman colleague showing this sort of intimacy and trust and comfort and vulnerability is really rare and special. I’m trying to think of another example from a popular show and can’t quite think of anything on the same level. There’s Don and Peggy in Mad Men but she never cries in his arms like this. They have a very well-written relationship but it doesn’t have the same intimacy. If Firefly had gotten to continue and they had kept up the wonderful character work I could see Mal and Zoe getting there. There’s Seinfeld and Elaine, Michael and Pam, but those are too comedic to be in the same category. Even in something like Lost, with a massive cast of people over so many seasons they never included a really great male-female friendship. Anyway, I understand the sentiment for wanting to keep the relationship in this sort of in-between area. They have surpassed just friendly colleagues, no doubt. There’s this devotion between them, it’s apparent when Scully says she wouldn’t risk her career for anyone but him, it’s apparent when Mulder gives up being able to aprehend the people he is after to be by her side as she nears death. It’s surpassed just colleagues, or just friends, but it’s not quite romantic either, and that’s beautiful and special. Please let me know if I’m forgetting a popular example. 

**ep14 Die Hand Die Verlatz**

* One of the darkest episodes so far. The girl’s story was really hard to listen to
* I read that the last episode originally was written to be about necrophilia and they had to change it because it couldnt be aired, but then this one has a highschool girl talking about being raped as a 4 year old then forcibly impregnated, then shows her slitting her wrists. So…. I’m curious what the guidelines are on what can be shown. Was this considered a shocking episode in the 90s?

**ep16 Colony**

https://preview.redd.it/qng98dlrnn5g1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4e22bdad9396d51aaa174555d9f8f540204f957

* Skinner’s office looks really smoky all the time 👀
* I’m really tired of Scully being put in mortal peril to move the plot or for dramatic rescue moments. It’s getting old at this point. Way too much of it.
* The MUSIC this episode, oh my god.

**ep17 End Game**

* Some really good and expensive-looking cinematography this episode. I went into this show not expecting anything from these areas but I continue to be impressed.
* I don’t understand how much the government is controlling things or if these aliens are operating on their own? The cloned beings desolve into green goop but the “bounty hunter” is made of the same stuff and can shapeshift? Mulder believes the alien group is so small that one individual would be able to tell him where his sister is? Why would he assume the aliens that took his sister are the exact same ones doing all this shit now? It feels somehow too big and too small simultaneously. Why does this bounty hunter guy care about his sister when presumably there’s been many other abductees?

**ep20 Humbug**

* The trailer park hotel manager’s little rant to Mulder was fucking amazing, and Mulder’s “*But I am an FBI agent”* LMAO
* Why the fuck does Mulder stick his finger into blood at crime scenes? This has happened several times. STOP IT.
* I needed this humor so badly after so many dark episodes. This was so well-written. It felt like maybe they were experimenting to see if they could pull off an episode like this. I loved the wacky camera angles and music.
* “*Imagine going your whole life looking like that.”* Mulder being perceived as a boring normal uninteresting man in this community was amazing. Also this episode had some really good commentary aside from being comedic, like when Scully opens her door and her robe is falling open but she’s also ogling the “freak” same way he’s ogling her. 

**ep25 Anasazi**

* The way Mulder is treating Scully is absolutely unacceptable. She’s putting her entire career and LIFE on the line for him and he’s treating her like shit. What the actual fuck? That was shocking, I was NOT expecting that. He’s acting like a fucking child.
* Okay, he was drugged. But still. I was wanting him to apologize to her the rest of the episode. Honestly he doesn’t deserve her, she does so much work (just look how much she did this episode!!) and is such a loyal support to him. Mulder’s a great character and I love him but, if I can be blunt, he would be nothing without Scully by his side at this point. She is an absolute ride-or-die and at some point in this story I need him to verbally tell her to her face how much that has meant to him. Again, great character, but he’s kind of a manchild sometimes.
* So “merchandise” is human test subjects traded for alien technology. Which implies an economic relationship between aliens and humans. But, they were also testing on alien captives, giving them smallpox vaccines and gassing them to death. Hm. I’m not clear on the nature of the relationship between aliens and humans yet. 

Random thought: The show has presumably spanned about a year and a half now and they’re ALWAYS in big coats like it’s winter weather…. will it never be spring or summer In DC? Maybe that’s a mystery they need to investigate.

1pg19qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1pg19qh/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I recently bought a **Hibrew H10B** coffee machine along with a **Wancle electric burr grinder**. This is my first time using any espresso machine, so I also picked up a few extras: a tamper, milk jugs, scales for weighing the beans, and of course some coffee beans.

**My problem:** I simply can’t get a good shot. I’m aiming for a *caffè latte*, but every shot I pull tastes extremely **sour** — undrinkably sour.

My grinder has a **24-step scale**. I can’t grind finer than **7**, because below that nothing comes out of the machine at all. I’ve tried grind settings **8, 9, and 10**, but the coffee is still sour every single time.

I’m using a **pressurized double-shot basket**. I’ve tried 15g and 18g doses and different shot volumes (40ml, 50ml, 70ml, 110ml). None of this changes the taste — still sour.

I also tried the **non-pressurized double basket**, but the results were even worse: only thin black water would come out. With the pressurized basket, at least I get a bit of crema.

For reference, my machine is set to **93°C**, with **7 seconds of pre-brew**, and the shot duration varies from **20 to 55 seconds**, depending on how much water I program.

At this point I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. Any advice for dialing in this setup would be greatly appreciated!",1,1765058262.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I'll go first. 

I read a fic that was a pretty standard slow burn. It had everything you can ask for, a slow pace, mutual pining, abusive family relationships, and 20,000 words per chapter. You know, the basics you're looking for.

But there was one thing that always stood out to me, and that was that one of the MMC's taste in coffee 

Orange juice, he would put orange juice in their coffee. And that was their favorite way to take coffee too. Everyone else in the fic was as weirded out as me don't get me wrong. But the character persisted and just kept on drinking his enigmatic concoction.

As a customer, I'm wondering there a trick to ordering (or a barista making) the hot chocolate taste like hot chocolate?

My wife even ordered one recently for me and it was fine. But it seems every time I order it (2% milk, both with and without whipped cream), the mocha is overpowering - and to me, as a non-coffee fan, it is off-putting. 

  
As for the second, the steamed apple juice - it would be so much tastier with a cider, or a juice that uses some pulp (such as the Simply Apple line) - Last time I ordered one (probably last winter), I saw that generic apple juice you could buy in a store was being used.... but in looking at the Starabucks website, I'm guessing I missed it this year, as I don't see it on the app menu.

It Really Can't Handle Medium Light Roast Coffee!?","This happened on my first new Breville Barista Express Machine - they replaced it under warranty, and now it's happening immediately on my SECOND new machine! I've tried a dozen different high quality medium/light roast beans, same issue on all of them. I tried a couple dark roast beans - it didn't happen on ANY of them, it ground through dark roasts like butter.

I've searched reddit, youtube, forums... this issue is shockingly difficult to find from any other users of the machine. I was sure after going 2 for 2 with this machine not being capable of grinding any gourmet lighter roasts I would find a million similar posts, but it's crickets. The few cases I've seen say it's either A) something is stuck in the grinder, or B) the machine is underpowered and incapable of grinding light roasts.

To rule out ""A"", I have taken apart the grinder to fully clean, vacuum, and confirm there are NO stuck beans, stones, or any other obstructions (on both machines). Re: ""B"" I would have thought there'd be a million more complaints posted online if aficionados were unable to grind their beloved light roasts. So...

1. Is it really user error? Somewhere between pouring high quality beans in the hopper and pushing grind I'm doing something wrong?
2. Or did I really get 2 back to back lemon machines?
3. Or is it just that 99% of the owners of this machine only use it for dark roasts only and never experience this problem (seems unlikely)?

Breville wants to repair or replace the machine AGAIN. Should I let them or is the device's simply too under-powered and inherently incapable of grind through any great Ethiopian beans lol?

Note: AI advised me to tighten up the internal burr to allow opening up the outer dial more. I dropped the internal burr setting from a 6 to a 4, then a 3, then a 2 setting. No dice. Same issue even with the outer grind size above 11.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

My brain operating on old wiring sort of hinted at, ""Ugh, going for the bus, when it's busy and lively? We've never done this before?"" and yeah I had thoughts of visiting my old haunts, I am certain I wouldn't drink and just get an AF beer but I realised, that's risky and I wouldn't even have fun.

It was super weird though, my brain knew Saturday as going to bars every single weekend. So seeing the city center and the bars then walking past for the bus, my brain honestly felt confused and sad. I don't even think for alcohol, just old neural pathways that are no longer relevant, like it went, ""I know what to do!"" then when I didn't follow, it went, ""Oh, maybe not, that's weird..."" and I could honestly feel my brain rewiring, figuring out what that means.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

The agents admitted they were waiting for a warrant to storm a man's property to capture them. Protesters waited on all sides of the streets, recording them, shaming them and blowing whistles to alert the public. Cars were used to blocade the roads so they couldn't escape. 

Neighbors and passersby came together sharing water bottles, coffee, donuts, pizzas, and whistles to the protesters to keep the rally going. Some protesters used megaphones and said prayers and encouraging words to the families trapped inside. Others shamed and demeaned the ICE agents for raiding their community stating, ""Welcome to Elgin, mo********ers, we're not going anywhere. This is the welcome you'll get when you try to steal our friends and family!"" There were around 150-200 protesters at its peak.

At around 3pm ICE agents stormed the man's home and captured him. In response to the peaceful protesters, ICE agents shot tear gas canisters throughout the neighborhood to disperse the crowd.

My 7/8 month puppy Merlin is adorable and also an absolute chaos goblin and I am begging for advice from anyone who has survived a sausage dog puppy.

Before anyone tries to come for me I did not get a puppy on a whim. I got him when I was seeing someone and that person is now very much gone because they turned out to be controlling and abusive ****** who pretended she was being abused/stalked by her exes for attention. So it is just me and Merlin now and I am doing this on my own and honestly learning everything the hard way.

He is cute. He is tiny. He is dramatic. He has the energy of a feral Victorian child. I feel like I need a manual for every part of his existence.

For example cooking. I cannot cook anything without him barking like I have betrayed him on a deep spiritual level. If I open the fridge he screams. If I chop food he behaves like hes on the keto diet ... starving. His bark. Its so piercing, how i have my ear drums in tack.. I dont know!

He has now also learned he can jump onto my bar stools and then onto the counters. I have accidentally created a tiny criminal mastermind. His legs are short yet somehow he moves like he is in Cirque du Soleil whenever food is involved. Yes he is fed. No you would not believe that based on his behaviour. He also got banned from my favourite cafe today for barking. I know. I can never go back because hes family

Also naps. I did not know puppies had to be taught how to nap. I thought sleep just happened. Apparently not. Merlin fights sleep like a toddler who has had a bag of skittles. And when he does finally pass out he has to be physically on me and if I breathe too loudly he wakes up and we begin again.

He is also the clingiest creature alive. I go to the bathroom and he is acting like he has been abandoned on the side of a motorway. I love him so much but wow 

So dachshund people please help me. I am trying so hard but this breed is a personality test.

Things I would love help with
How to cook without a meltdown in the background
How to teach  him not to continue dragging me to coffee shops just because he likes a puppy cup.
How to teach him to nap somewhere that is not my physical body
Anything else you wish someone had told you before getting a dachshund

I love him. I am just tired and figuring this out as I go as a single parent. Any advice from people who have survived the chaos would be amazing.",1,1765057612.0,Puppyblues,1,1.0,False

1pg0w51,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarDIY/comments/1pg0w51/diy_solarbattery_bank_question/,DIY solar/battery bank question,"My head is spinning a bit...(sorry...I tend to write a lot)

Off grid...no utilities.

I currently have 4x 100W panels, going to a Victron 100/30 MPPT.  Charges a 12v battery bank made up of 4x 12v/200AH LiFePO4 batteries in parallel.  The battery bank is connected to a 12v 4000w inverter that powers everything.  It's worked well enough for the past couple of years for my little cabin.

We run a small fridge, 2 lights, stand up fan (summer), charge phones/laptop, Starlink and as needed a nespresso coffee machine, kettle, rice cooker/steamer.  Charge power tool batteries when needed, etc.  We turn off the entire cabin and inverter when we leave...so nothing is drawing from the batteries.

We have generally only been up there for the fair weather weekends during the spring-to-fall.  So the battery bank has had all week to charge up and it's always (I think) been fully charged when we arrive.

If the weather is cloudy/overcast/no-sun, the bank (measuring with a multimeter looking at the voltage of the bank) is pretty much dead.  Get up there Friday evening...by Sunday mornings it's pretty much empty/low and if we don't have sun it'll be empty before we leave.

Want/need/objective - to be able to work remotely (I work from home 99% of the time) for a week at a time, with (assuming fair weather and sun) power available without having to charge the battery bank with the generator/truck inverter.  In the mid-summer, that's not really an issue as there's so much sun that the bank will be recharged a good bit during a full sun day.

I already have (collected over time) available:  1x 4000W 24V Inverter and 5x 285W panels and 2x 295W panels.  Looking at getting a Victron 150/45 so I can use more panels in the string.

As I'll use these larger panels...the 4x 100W panels will go off to other uses.

If I want more power reserves available, I figure that I need a bigger capacity battery bank.  Thinking of 24V bank made up of 4x 24v 314AH batteries in parallel.  (which I think triples my battery bank capacity).

The question is...am I thinking of this correctly?

The Victron 100/30 can only charge batteries at 30A.

Assume I get 5hrs of sun on the panels...and there is enough PV power coming in so the MPPT can charge the bank at 30A....(i know that it gets weak sun in the morning/evening/etc...but just keeping it simple and dumbing it way down for me)

\- does that mean my MPPT is putting 5hrs \* 30A = 150AH back into the bank each day....and so it would take 800AH bank total / 150 AH per day = 5.33 days to charge the bank completely (from theoretically dead)?

\---- in practice, in the mid-summer I know that it doesn't take that long, probably more like 3 days.

\- and if I built a 4x 24V 314AH bank...1256AH total...then with the same conditions/charger it would take 8.37 days to fully charge it?

\- and regardless of whatever charger I get (willing to get others) if the batteries can only be charged at a max of 30A...then how do you ever charge them up faster (e.g. you can only put the power back in so fast no matter how many solar panels you have/etc)?  What am I missing?  I think the specs say that I can charge my 12v 200AH batteries at a max of 50A...but I'm not sure about that.  I have definitely charged them at 30A with an external charger plugged into the generator.

\--- or do you have to go with a battery bank so large that you'll never run it down (i.e. in the 7 days that I'm up there doing stuff) and let everything catch back up when you're not using things.  I'd like to leave the starlink running but if I do with the current setup, I tend to run the bank out after 3 days if there's no really good sun (e.g. fall/winter).  If I've got great sun everyday then it's fine.

Is it as ""simple"" as setting up 4x of my 285W panels (44V 9A) in 2S2P to have a max of 88V 18A PV going into the 100/30 MPPT charger so I'm catching as much solar power every day so the MPPT can charge the bank as much as it can (still only up to 30A).  Even at 8hrs of sun I still figure that it'll take 3.33 days to charge up the 800AH bank.

If I can find a way to charge up the batteries faster each day, I am 100% ok with not buying changing my system from 12v to 24v...and super duper ok with not shelling out for new batteries. :)

I must be doing something wrong or missing something.

I remember my grandfather telling me how he used to play ding dong ditch, it was a badge of honour who could get the most swears from the irritated homeowners. Grandfather proudly showed off the scar he got from the pan thrown at his head.  The old bungalow loomed over the town high on a hill. At night, its lit windows glowed like the eyes of a beast, watching over us with the patience of an immortal being. Ivy climbed its brick walls like a second skin; trash dotted the overgrown lawn. Beer cans and condoms. Every time I passed it, even from a distance, I could smell the place. The stale scent of mold carried on the wind; it was as if the place was rotting from the inside.

An eyesore, my mother called it, and yet, nothing was done about it. No one condemned it, or did welfare checks on the aged owners. The Carroways had influence my parents said, whatever that meant. From the few glimpses I caught of them, I couldn’t see how. Mr Carroway, a squat man, more fat than sense, always walked around in a filthy wifebeater vest. Grease and coffee stains painted him like a pattern, paired with cargo shorts that revealed pale, balloon-like legs, he looked, for lack of a better term, like an off-duty clown. Mrs Carroway on the other hand, was made from plastic. A barbie doll left out in the sun for too long. Her wrinkly jowls were pulled back with Botox, her gnashing teeth shined like porcelain. Looking at her just felt wrong, especially when she stood next to her husband. A funhouse mirror couple. Every weekend they came into town, Mr Carroway touched everything in the display cases, leaving a trail of greasy handprints in his wake, while Mrs Carroway shrieked her shrill laugh. The town agreed they were a nuisance, but nothing was done. Whether from fear or this supposed influence, I couldn’t tell you. Then, something happened.

Two months had passed; the couple hadn’t been seen since. They were still in the house. Every night, thick black smoke billowed from the chimney, filling the dark sky like fog, permeating the air with an acrid, burnt smell. It clung to your clothes, burnt the hairs of your nostrils. People didn’t care, as long as the couple no longer bothered them. The Carroway house was an old, dilapidated house, owned by a strange couple gone missing. So, why am I writing about it? Because I am going to break inside.

Not by myself, of course, I have friends tagging along. Safety in numbers as they say. Alvin, my next-door neighbour, was a squirrely, hyperactive kid, raised on the iPad. He jumped when I mentioned going to the house, but insisted on filming it.

“Why?” I asked, frowning at his cheap handheld camera,

“For YouTube,” he said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world,

“We could be the next Sam and Colby,”

I scoffed, “Doubt it.”

It sounded like a stupid idea to me, but I let him bring the camera, if only to keep him quiet. If he did upload to YouTube, I doubt it would get many views. He better not do that stupid Wojack face for the thumbnail.

My other friend, Harris Simmons, was, unfortunately, a wimp, no other way to say it. Smaller than the rest of the kids in class, jumping at every sound, and with yellow skin, it made him a prime target for bullies. Born with jaundice, it gave him skin like candlewax, that and his initials earned him the nickname, ‘Homer Simpson.’ Alvin still called him that, much to his chagrin. It wasn’t as bad as the other nickname, ‘Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.’ Besides that, he was a good kid, went along with anything, even exploring a weird, scary house. I asked him if he truly was alright, he once admitted that the Carroways gave him night terrors. Harris nodded, his blond hair flopping,

“I’ll be fine, it might cure me of my nightmares.”

I wasn’t so sure about that. As we walked up the overgrown path, lined by thorny bushes, I could see Harris getting nervous. His waxy skin glowed with sweat,

“Guys, I don’t know,” he muttered, the wind whipping away his words, “This seemed like a good idea during the day, do we have to do this at night?”

Alvin scoffed, “It isn’t night yet,” he pointed his camera up at the violet sky,

Harris tutted, “Whatever, it’s going to be in a few minutes, and what if the old woman catches us?”

“No chance, my brother says she was taken away,” Alvin reassured,

“When?”

Alvin shrugged, “I don’t know, he said she was stalking the streets, singing and chasing after cars,”

“Taken by who?”

Alvin shrugged, “Police, ambulance, nuthouse, does it matter?”

“I guess not.”

Harris wasn’t convinced, biting down on his golden lip. I bumped shoulders with him,

“Hey, try not to worry, if anything goes wrong, we’ll protect you,” I glanced at Alvin, currently doing 360 spins with his eye stuck to the camera,

“Well, I will, anyway.”

Harris offered a shaky nod, shuffling along with his hands clasped. I gave him another reassuring pat, then, Alvin dropped his clunky camera, followed by a torrent of swears. Harris jumped, frowning at their friend.

They traipsed through the overgrown brush, snapping twigs, and crushing beer cans underfoot. The only sound in the otherwise quiet night. Looking back, I should’ve noticed that it was too quiet. We reached the front door, bunched awkwardly on the doorstep. Alvin was closest but instead of reaching for the handle, he just zoomed in and out with the camera. I sighed, even Harris twitched with irritation,

“Maybe it’s locked,” the fear returned full force.

Wordlessly, I grabbed the handle, it turned easily. Harris visibly deflated.  The door swung open with an ear-splitting creak, revealing a wall of darkness. Alvin went first, camera ready, mouth hanging open, then me, pulling Harris along. We stepped over the dark threshold, straight into the maw of the beast.

The moment I entered, the first thing that hit me was the smell. Grease. The stuffy air was thick was it. It was like the walls had absorbed the grease from a thousand meals. The front door led them into the kitchen, the core of the greasy stench. The kitchen was a mess. The counters were piled high with dirty dishes, layered with crusty mold that was once food. Pots and pans congealed with fat, sticking out of stagnant dishwater. The peeling wallpaper revealed dark patches underneath, I peered closer with a grimace, black mold. Finding a light switch, I flicked it, filling the air with the incessant buzz of fluorescent bulbs. It was like stepping into a 24-hour diner.

Our footsteps stuck and unstuck to the floor like Velcro. The windows were decorated with handprints, like after the Carroways ate their fried food, they pressed their hands and faces to peer out the window. Alvin audibly cringed, sticking his camera into the grime. Harris stood in the middle of the tacky floor, hesitant to go further but unwilling to run away.

“They really liked fried food,” Alvin noted, dipping a finger in the congealed in the congealed fat. It left an indent up to his knuckle,

“Ew! Don’t touch it!” Harris exclaimed, Alvin laughed,

“Hey Homer,” he spun round, brandishing his gooped finger at Harris,

“Same shade.”

Harris puffed up with anger, stepping forward to shove him. I ignored them, nauseous from the stench.

We left the kitchen, closing the door to hopefully cut off the smell. It didn’t work. The cold hallway was dark; I thought it was from the lack of light but no, the walls were plastered with black mold. Pulling my shirt over my nose, I gestured for the others to do the same. My father told me about black mold, if you breathed in even one spore, it would settle in your lungs and fester. Killing the pink tissue and shrinking the lungs until you hacked up black muck. Harris had his shirt pulled up to his nose, leaving only his watery eyes darting around. I couldn’t help thinking that his red shirt made him look more like Bart Simpson. Alvin had the camera close enough to the wall to scratch off dark flakes. I slapped him on the back.

“Stop it, asshole.”

As they walked further down the contaminated hallway, careful not to breathe, another sound joined the buzzing cacophony. It was like the crackle of an old TV. They passed a living room, sat against the wall was an ancient cuboid TV, complete with crooked rabbit ears. It was on but no one watched. The screen danced with fuzzy static, background music to our antics. Alvin ran around, chirping and zooming in on everything.

“Look at the state of this couch!”

Plopped in the middle of the room was a red satin couch, dark and shiny from years of use. As I got closer, there was a definite person shaped imprint. Mr Carroway’s fat body was forever embedded in the cushions, flattened by years of sweat and grease.

“Ew!” Harris shouted, peering over Alvin’s shoulder,

“I dare you to touch it, Homer,” Alvin smirked,

“No way, are you crazy? I’ll catch Ebola or something,”

“Aw, come on. Don’t be a loser,”

“How does not touching something gross make me a loser?”

“I don’t know, ask your mother.”

Harris flushed; it only made his cheeks more golden. I sighed, walking away from the stupid argument. I walked around the room, looking at the pictures hanging on the walls. The Carroways throughout the years. The first was of the young couple, in old timey wedding attire. The woman scowled out at him, the husband with his eyes closed, light reflecting off his shiny, bald head. Wait, bald? Mr Carroway wasn’t bald. He had disgusting, matted hair. Hair didn’t just grow back, did it? In the second picture, Mrs Carroway still scowled, with a few lines around her, with her blonde husband, hanging off her arm. No, that wasn’t right either. Mr Carroway had black hair. I didn’t bother looking at the rest, even at a glance I saw there was a different man in each one.

“Jeez, Mrs Carroway sure got around, huh?” I turned to my friends, only to find them still bickering. Alvin pressuring Harris to touch the couch, shouting ‘Doh’ as he did. Harris just seethed, trembling with barely disguised anger,

“If I touch the stupid couch, then you have to stop calling me Homer Simpson,” Harris told him, Alvin smirked,

“Yeah, sure, just do it.”

Harris took a hesitant step forward, like approaching a wild animal. His yellow fingers danced across the crusty couch; the plastic screech of the material set my teeth on edge. Harris barely held back a whine,

“It’s like touching a bald man’s head.”

The mention of bald reminded me of what I found, before I could reveal it, Alvin made another stupid joke,

“Bald like Homer?”

He laughed as Harris shot him a glare. Alvin walked away, still chuckling. I stuck out my foot, and Alvin went flying, him and the camera clattered to the floor. I shot Harris a thumbs up. Alvin grunted, face planting against the wall. He steadied himself with a hand, then jumped back like he was electrocuted.

He yelped, “What the hell?!”

He touched the wall again; his bruised face twisting with confusion.

“This wall is freaky,”

“Yeah, yeah, very funny,” I muttered, gesturing for Harris to follow me,

“No, seriously,” Alvin scrabbled for his camera, “Touch it.” He reached for my hand; I slapped him away.

“Alvin, you’re starting to piss me off.”

Starting to panic, Alvin grabbed Harris’s hand, and pressed it against the wall.

“God damn it, Alvin, I-,” Harris frowned, feeling up the wall. His eyes widened,

“Ugh,” he turned to me, “The wall is soft.”

“Soft?”

The living room walls were plastered with old newspapers, the few bare spots were a sickly shade of pink, mottled with the same mold as the hallway. Alvin raised his camera, pressing a finger to the wall again. There was some give to the wall, it even squished under his touch.

“God, how does that even happen?”

His finger came away shiny, “The wall feels like it’s about to crumble,”

I rolled my eyes, “It’s the mold.”

“It must be all over the place,” Harris said, rubbing his hand on his jeans, Alvin whipped his camera from the wall to Harris’s yellowed finger.

“We better watch the house doesn’t fall around us,” he sniffed his hand, frowning.

The TV buzzed away, the layer of dust added to the sour damp smell. Just as I was about to suggest we leave, my ears picked up another sound.

“Someone’s coming!” I hissed. Footsteps were crunching up the path. I heard a key entering the lock, we didn’t have enough time to run, we were going to have to hide.

“Scatter.”

Alvin ran first, still clutching his stupid camera. Harris didn’t move, rigid with fear. I had to drag him along by his sleeve. I heard Alvin thundering up the stairs, that idiot was going to get caught. I couldn’t even call out to him. Harris found a closet opposite the stairs; we dove inside just as the door swung open. The person lumbered in, their gait uneven. When we got our breathing under control, I cautiously opened the closet door, just enough to peer out. The closet was humid, already sweat dripped down my back, even more when she came into view.

Mrs Carroway. She was back.

“Alvin said she was gone,” Harris hissed, sounding close to tears, I nudged him to keep quiet.

I had never been this close to her. The stink of cigarettes and bacon overpowered the sour dampness. She was old, decrepit, whatever Botox she had had long faded as her face swam with wrinkles. Her cheeks dangled like the jowls of a dog. Her artificial red hair curled into a perm, dye staining her pale forehead, clashing with the lipstick staining her lips. She wore a neon purple windbreaker suit that swished with every movement. Harris gripped my arm, wetting my sleeve with his clammy hand.

Mrs Carroway ascended the stairs at a snail’s pace. Taking each step like it was a herculean effort, her red clawed hand gripped the banister, the wood creaked. Halfway up, she paused for breath, just as a thud came from upstairs. Mrs Carroway tilted her head. I motioned for Harris to hold his breath. Mrs Carroway stood still, hunched over like a hunchback. As I watched her, something flashed in her milky eyes, something that scared me. That, paired with the long pink tongue darting out to wet her lips, smearing the lipstick even more, made me think of a hungry animal.

I felt Harris’s hand slip from mine; he must have been terrified. Mrs Carroway straightened up, her back cracking like a gunshot, then, with speed that belied her age, the old woman rushed up the stairs. Stranger still, she ran up on all fours, her hands slapping the wood. I stared, mouth open, long after she ran-crawled out of sight. After a moment of silence, I poked my head out of the damp closet.

“We need to get out of here,” I hissed. Harris nodded, a quick spasm of fear. We hurried quickly and quietly back to the kitchen. The door had been locked.

“Damn it.”

Another heavy thud from upstairs made them jump,

“Shit, Alvin’s still upstairs,” Harris shivered, his golden skin iridescent with fear sweat. Harris wouldn’t last much longer without breaking down, we had to be careful if we had to get out.

“Harris, I know you’re scared but I need you to go and find another exit.”

Harris looked at me with wide eyes, looking like I just condemned him to death. I was quick to reassure him,

“You just need to be quiet, and go back through the living room. I have to find Alvin, then I’ll find you and we’ll get out of here together. Ok?”

Harris, though he trembled with fear, nodded. I patted his shoulder, ignoring the dampness of his shirt. With that, he hurried off, disappearing into the gloom. Then, it was just me. As the de facto leader, it was my responsibility to get everyone out of here, I would not fail. As I stopped at the first step, I would be lying if I said I didn’t hesitate. The old woman could be waiting just round the corner, ready to grab me, but I had to save my stupid friend. I was going to lord it over him.

The bare wooden steps were hollow, but didn’t creak, thankfully. As the landing came into view, the dim, flickering lights made it look like it was illuminated by candles. The stink of grease was at its strongest up here. The mold had spread to the upper floor. There were too many rooms, too many for Alvin to hide, and the old woman. I listened but couldn’t hear her awkward steps. A trail of yellow led its way into the bedroom, did the couple just carry buckets of grease into the bed? Something stopped me in my tracks; my feet rooted to the floor. There, in the middle of the stained floor, was a battered camera. Alvin’s camera.

I had to warn Harris, against my better judgement, I snuck back down the stairs, hissing his name. I checked the kitchen first, the yellow walls bright enough to burn my eyes. Wait, yellow. The kitchen walls shone as if covered in fresh grease. Mrs Carroway went straight upstairs. The walls, originally covered in newspaper, squished under my touch. The mold was gone, replaced with a new leathery texture. The soft, yellow texture felt clammy, like sweaty skin. I had to feel my way out of the kitchen, feeling nauseous for some reason. I ducked my head into each stinking room, but he was nowhere to be found. Maybe Harris had already escaped? I couldn’t blame him. I crossed my fingers, and headed back up the stairs. Alvin’s camera lay on the floor, untouched.

A shuffling from the bedroom made me jump. Fabric shifted, someone getting into bed. If I was quiet and got to the others before they did anything, we could escape. Where could they be? Alvin dropped it in a hurry, it was still running.

I rewound the camera; its high-pitched whine made me look over my shoulder. The footage was just jumbled scenes at first, telling me that Alvin was running and forgot to turn off the camera. I watched it shake left and right, punctuated by Alvin’s heavy breathing. I watched him try to find a hiding place but each room he ducked into was weirder than the last. The yellow and mold were normal compared to these. The first room was dark, as the camera’s light glinted against the walls, they glistened. The walls were wet, covered in thick, dark sludge, it dripped from the ceiling in thick strands. It was like the room had been submerged underwater.

The second room was another bedroom, plastic wrap covered the furniture, even the bed. Piled high on the surfaces were rolls of stained bandages, dripping something pink onto the floor. I felt like I could smell it through the camera. Alvin’s exclamation rang out from the camera’s tinny speakers. As the camera shifted, a pair of bare feet came into view, bony and wrinkled. Just like a scene from a found footage movie, the camera swung round and Mrs Carroway’s face filled the screen. Her sunken, milky eyes glared, staring at me through the camera. With a sound like a plunger unsticking from a blocked toilet, Alvin was gone. The camera fell to the floor with a thud, the sound from earlier.

From the new crooked angle, I saw Mrs Carroway grab Alvin by the scruff of the neck, lifting him against the wall. Alvin’s face twisted in fear, his mouth opened in a silent scream, impossibly wide, until I thought the skin of his lips would split. I waited for Alvin to push the old woman away; it should’ve been so easy but Alvin didn’t move. His eyes darted frantically, twin orbs spasming in his skull. What was going on? Movement caught my eye; I peered in closer. Something about Alvin’s bare arms disturbed me. The skin seemed to be getting redder. He twisted his head, straining his neck until the tendons bulged. His body refused to follow.

With a sound like Velcro unsticking, Alvin lifted his arm.

His skin remained behind. Like a flesh-coloured sleeve, degloved, gooey like melted bubble gum. His exposed muscles twitched and pulsed, red, wet and shiny. the skin of his arms fused to the wall, slowly sinking into the plaster. Like sweaty skin stuck to a leather couch. His shed skin was gone, absorbed into the wall, and it was taking the rest of him. The wall was absorbing him. It was soft, malleable, he sank through like it was made from wet tissue. The skin was sucked from his body, stretching out to paint the wall. Pinks and reds mixed with the rotted wallpaper. The vivid colours burned my eyes. Alvin didn’t scream; he didn’t make a sound as he was painfully consumed. Swallowed up by the house.

I saw all of this through the camera. I saw Mrs Carroway run a bony hand along the quivering, pink wall, licking her lips as she did. She bent down, picked up his scattered clothes, and disappeared into her bedroom. The camera shook, almost falling from my trembling hands. What the hell did I just watch?

As I struggled to comprehend what just happened, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I was being watched. Looking up, the camera slipped from my hands. There, staring out at me from the black void of the room was Mrs Carroway. Her head floated in the darkness like a grim spectre, her mouth spread open in a wet, toothless smile, spit dribbled as she smacked her lips. Something radiated from the woman like a stench, something that my body sensed before i realised what it was. Hunger.

She reached out, quick as a flash, bony fingers latching onto my neck. Her touch was boiling hot, searing my skin. She pulled me in close, face to slimy face, spitting as her pink tongue curled out, and ran along my face. She was tasting me. Her tongue writhed like a dying fish. Her breath was acrid, hot, my vision filled with her gnashing gums. Somehow, my panicked kicking made contact with her withered body, her grip loosened. I pushed the witch away. She collided against the wall, knocking over a table in the process. I didn’t waste the chance. I ran down the stairs, taking three at a time. I didn’t bother with the door; I just kicked out a window. The glass sliced at my skin, warm blood trickled down my arms. I didn’t care, I only cared about getting out. Finally out, I collapsed onto the soft grass, the cool night air sobering yet overwhelming my heightened senses. My body broke into violent tremors as a scream built up in my throat. It tore its way out, wrenching my throat as it did. Feeling lighter, I got up on trembling legs and ran. My gait as awkward as a newborn deer. I glanced back only once. There, at the shattered window, was the figure of Mrs Carroway, staring after me. Wide eyed, still smacking her red lips. I didn’t dare look back again.

No one believed my story, at first. They couldn’t disprove it when Harris and Alvin were declared missing. When the police finally went inside to investigate, they came running back out, spewing their guts. My parents refused to tell me anything, all they said was that Harris and Alvin could rest in peace. That didn’t comfort me. The Carroway house was soon spoken with the same reverence as Ed Gein’s house. Human flesh was found in the walls, bones in the bed and furniture. Apparently, they found Mr Carroway in one of the bedrooms, or what was left of him. I heard a rumour that his body was so deteriorated that they had to take in the whole bed as evidence. They couldn't separate him. The greasy smell made so much more sense. Mrs Carroway was taken away by the police, still smiling that dripping smile, even as she was pushed into the cop car. The adults said I hallucinated the entire thing, the house eating my friends. It took years of therapy, I came to accept that fact, but if it was a hallucination, then what the hell was on that camera?

nothing forced - if there’s an ease or a spark, great. if not, that’s fine too. i’m open to whatever feels natural: new friends, something that slowly becomes more, or just a genuinely interesting back-and-forth.

1pg0r2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Malice_In_Bloom/comments/1pg0r2t/the_trial/,The Trial,"The hall feels colder than it should, an impossibly long chamber with walls smooth and off-white, like aging eggshells. The floor offers no reflection, not even her shadow stands with her here.

High above, the light hovers over her pale skin, bright enough to catch every quiver of her hands, yet too weak to reach the judge’s platform or jury box. Even the far corners give way to darkness—like a held breath, waiting.  


Dona walks down the aisle. She is small in stature, yet every movement is weighted with the choices she has made—each one riding on her shoulders like a passenger she cannot shake.

The first row of chairs in the gallery and the aisle stretching down the middle is all she can see; everything else dissolves into shadow. The doors at the back of the chamber rise impossibly high, fading into darkness above. They stand unmoving, never opening, never shifting, as if carved from dread itself.  


She moves toward the defendant’s table, each step measured and graceful, yet falling silent, as if the room were soundproof. She sits slowly, the chair creaking once before the sound dies. Amethyst hair falls in soft waves around her shoulders, framing a face both delicate and burdened.

Her blue eyes, wide and luminous, hold a quiet sorrow. She wipes her long lashes, trembling with unshed tears, then folds her hands on the table as she tries to steady them. Her fingers shake like loose teeth, betraying her fragile attempt at resolve.  


A button nose and softly rounded cheeks soften the lines of guilt etched into her features. Silence settles over her in slow layers; soft as dust, suffocating as ash. Even as she waits, poised to speak, every moment betrays her unease—the tremor in her posture, the uncertainty in her eyes. Every inhale feels borrowed, every heartbeat a muted drum of self-reproach.  


Then, at last, she speaks.  


“He gave me the intermittent love I had always known,” she says, her voice cracking the silence, ricocheting off walls that had swallowed every sound before. “Can you blame me?”  


A rustle stirs in the darkness—a whisper she cannot discern—then a thousand incorporeal voices resound:  


“YES.”  


Dona shudders in response.  


A faint tension thickens the air. It brushes her memory like a moth’s wing. Her chest tightens; the world once pressed this way long ago; sporadic, inconsistent, shaping what she would come to want.

A faint breeze stirs, and with it comes a sound so small Dona almost dismisses it. A child’s laugh begins to grow and ring. Bright. Sharp. Echoing somewhere high in the rafters.  


It skitters along the walls like a marble dropped on stone. Then the muffled crack of something breaking; patience, someone’s temper, a person’s resolve. The child’s laugh fractures. It warps, thins, becomes a cry. Then a wail. The echoes drift past her like petals on the wind, too fragile, too familiar. Goosebumps prick her skin as the hall falls silent again.  


A low hum rolls through the chamber, the lantern’s flames lowering as if bowed beneath despair older than the walls that contain it. Sorrow pools at the borders of the witness box, thick and dark as a basin of ink.

From it, Solan coalesces—heartbreak made man, every movement heavy with grief. The edges of his form ebb and flow, a shape drawn from loss and longing. His eyes, deep and unyielding, carry the weight of all that had been broken between them.  


Before the court stood not the man who has slept beside her these past years; confident, forgiving, and warm; but the boy he once was—the version Dona broke long before they became what they are.

His caramel skin appears pale beneath the lantern’s glow. Almond eyes, dark as espresso, calm on the surface but churning beneath. Long black hair falling the familiar way; still a head taller, still carrying that quiet strength she always sought.  


Her incorporeal voice springs forth from beyond her, cataloging every truth she refused to speak aloud.  


“I made him the harbor that I abandoned every time Medusa’s tide pulled at me, only to wash back ashore when that tide receded. I broke his faith in cycles, wearing grooves into his soul the way waves carve stone.”  


Her true voice answers, small and human, thinning at the edges of a cry she cannot release.  


“I didn’t mean to hurt him,” she whispers, tentative and raw. “I love him… I always have.”  


Solan speaks immediately after, as though he has been waiting years for this moment.  


“You broke me; over, and over, and over again,” Solan says, his voice soft as a bruise. “And when you’d finally had enough,” His expression wavers, confusion surfacing like an old wound. “You called the shattered mess a mistake.”  


Dust falls loose from the rafters. Her breath catches, her heart stumbles. Even the walls shudder. A silence settles; heavy as love that once hoped. Solan slowly dissolves back into the edges of the witness stand. Only his lingering sorrow remains.  


The room begins to relax. It feels like someone opened the windows and let the air back in, and for a moment, she can breathe again. Then, another figure begins to rise.  


Darkness deepens at the doorway. Dēor emerges from it—towering like a giant, a memory given form. Built like a lumberjack, he drifts down the aisle, a somber vapor trailing like mist in his wake. His form wavers, like a memory struggling to hold itself together.  


As he takes his place at the witness stand, Dona’s voice erupts, once again, from beyond her body, sweeping through the chambers. Again, it speaks truths she cannot bring herself to say.  


“He lifted a lantern toward me, warning me from the edge I insisted on walking—and I answered with storms. I left him in the half-light, turning the page on our chapter as I authored his betrayal.”  


Her own voice answers, small and uneven, neither denying nor fully accepting; a feeble attempt to soften the edges of grief.  


“He’s my brother,” she murmurs, voice quivering. “I never meant to leave him behind.”  


Just as she finishes her words, Dēor’s voice drifts across the room, like a broken-hearted lullaby on the wind.  


“You took the flame of your pain,” Dēor says, voice cracking like glass under strain, “and burned my world—watched me reduced to cinders.” Tears gather in his eyes. “You burnt me without explanation and left. Do you know what that did to me?”  


She holds back stinging tears; tries to steady her breathing, but her body quivers. The cold weight of guilt deepens in her chest.  


Dēor’s image frays, thinning like mist, retreating into the half-light where memories go when they can’t move on. As Dēor disappears, it’s as if the air goes with him momentarily. Then—as if the room itself takes a breath, she can almost feel the weight of her soul start to lift a little.

As she breathes a heavy sigh, a small figure begins to take form in the witness box. Her heart catches in her throat—she doesn’t need to see the face to know who is next as she silently begs for it to stop.  


Shadows pulse at the witness stand, writhing like smoke from a dying fire, weaving into form from darkness itself. Her son—not the fourteen-year-old who laughs freely beyond this hall, but the innocent child she once carried against her chest—stands almost whole, yet fraying at the edges, as if one breath could unravel him.

He is uncertain on his feet, his straight, dark-brown hair catching the swaying lantern light. His usual bright smile that lit her whole world is gone. Instead, a frown takes its place, so doleful it could dim diamonds.  


The chamber stills, and the uncanny sound of her voice, again, unfurls from beyond her body, tracing lines through memory and marrow alike.  


“I drowned those early weeks in chemicals and smoke, never noticing the heartbeat forming inside me. When truth finally reached me, it settled as ash on a field I’d already scorched.”  


Her voice shivers out in response—meek, fractured—a mother’s cry trying to undo what cannot be undone.  


“How could I have known?” she whispers, fragile as mist. “I never planned him…”  


In response, her son does not speak. He does not need to. He only looks up at her with those ever-shifting eyes until the weight of his silence becomes a verdict. The chamber suddenly feels dense; burdened. The sheer intensity seems to warp the air in the courtroom, causing time to feel stretched out, as if seconds become minutes. Then he begins to unthread into the air, piece by piece, until nothing remains but the ache.  


The silence that follows cuts like a trillion blades to her heart, straight through to her soul. The kind of agony that breaks a mother into pieces. Her defenses crumble further—she wants to disappear before the next figure rises; yet knows it will not stop.

But for a moment, in all of this, the room again feels as though it takes a heavy sigh, a much-needed breather before the next figure arises.  


The room begins to darken palpably, lanterns dimming as though cowed by something they dare not illuminate. The air grows colder; somber, heavy. She presses her palms to her face, praying the next figure will not come…but he does.  


Medusa steps out of the shadows, smoke and embers writhing and recoiling around him. His eyes find her instantly. Dona’s spine locks, every nerve seized—read like scripture and judged wanting. In that single gaze, the chamber petrifies. The breath of the room halts. Time holds itself still, as if his presence is a command.  


He steps into the witness box, the ceiling buckling under his presence. A villain-made hero, not as he truly is, but as memory has carved him. Caramel skin and short black hair ignore the dim but sterile courtroom glare, flawless and immovable; it seems as if even the air bends around him.

Almond-shaped eyes shimmer with the devilish twinkle that once made her swoon—eyes that roil like galaxies of desire; mischievous and molten. But behind the mischief is something darker: ire that burns for her alone—like a star collapsing inward.  


Once more, her incorporeal voice leaps from beyond herself, slamming against the walls of the chamber with a force she cannot resist as her legs feel weak beneath.  


“I mistook hunger for devotion and stitched his late-night echoes into a tomorrow he never offered. When a future of parturition looked back at me, I tried to force him into the shape of a father he wasn’t. When he ran, I tried to drag him back into the fire.”  


She responds, smaller, thinner, almost broken by the weight of her own words.  


“I… I thought I loved him,” she whispers, voice trembling. “I tried to resist… but I[—]()I let myself want him, even when I knew I shouldn’t.” She stares at the floor, unable to look Medusa in the eyes. “And when I disc—""  


Medusa’s voice, booming, interjects before Dona can finish; a god’s verdict amplified by invisible loudspeakers.  


“Was, ‘I’m not into you,’ not enough?” Medusa asks, incredulously. “You had to drag me into the rubble after I was already gone and insist the bloom in that rubble was mine?”  


The floor tilts as her grip tightens on the table’s edge, her heart racing into a painful gallop. Nausea rolls through her in sharp, cold waves. The vast hall seems to shrink around her; walls closing in, the ceiling sinking as though the whole room exhales against her.

Medusa fades into the shadows, his galaxian eyes the last to disappear. Dona tries to steady herself; deep breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth; and for a moment, she begins to feel almost steady.  


Then a low, familiar hum rises from the rafters; a far-off pulse of hip-hop, muffled like a radio in another room. It is accompanied by the pungent aroma of greenhouse thunder, damp and electric. The lantern light softens as warmth spills into the chamber; subtle at first, then blooming like sunlight through winter curtains.

The bright ring of a child laughing, unguarded. The clean scent of dish soap. They drift through the chamber—glints of half-remembered yesterdays—each carrying patience, kindness, and the fierce, protective strength only a mother can offer.  


Shadows loosen from the highest corner, falling in soft, reluctant strands—threads of every kindness she’d borrowed from the woman who tried to teach her how to be a mother. They reach the witness box, and a form unveils like a sigh releasing, until the All-Mother stands before her. A peer who’d already born whole worlds; she had a soul that was both burdened and wizened by her own past, with eyes that saw every crack long before Dona admitted they were there.  


For one heartbeat, the room feels forgiven. Almost safe. Then warmth folds inward, collapsing like a lung. Cold threads into the marrow, precise and surgical. The lanterns dim in reverence, not fear. The courtroom shrinks, ashamed.  


The All-Mother speaks nothing, only looks with quiet, patient disappointment. In that single, steady gaze, Dona sees every ghost reflected back at once:  


Solan’s broken faith.

Dēor’s abandoned hearth.

Her child's early corruption.

Medusa’s unheeded truth.

Every debt she fled.

Every heart she left colder than the last.  


The All-Mother does not need to accuse—her eyes hold the entire ledger. No incorporeal voice rises to confess. No words come to fill the silence. There is only the unbearable sum of everything Dona took and everything she destroyed, hanging in the air like a scent that refuses to fade.

Her face crumples. Her knees buckle: she misses the table’s edge and collapses into her chair. Tears fall again without sound—each one carrying the weight of every life she scorched and pretended she hadn’t. She tries to speak, to apologize, to beg; her mouth opens, but the words stick in her throat. Even they refuse to step forward, as if ashamed to be spoken.  


The All-Mother holds her gaze just long enough for the full accounting to settle inside Dona like stones dragged across the ocean floor. Then she fades; not shattering, not vanishing, but dissolving, like steam rising off a cup of coffee. Her exit is gentler than the rest, yet the cold she leaves behind is deeper, more final. Slowly, Dona’s heart stumbles back into rhythm, and the trial remembers itself.  


Then a voice fills the room—booming, layered, echoing from everywhere at once; motherly, fatherly, both, neither.  


“Cross-examination.”  


The shadows lean close as something between photographs and wounds opens overhead. Shapes bloom out of the dark like bruises and become television screens.  


*Evidence.*  
  


Every wrong she chose.

Every wound she caused.

Every cowardly moment.  


They parade across the screens with merciless clarity, each scene sharper than memory, each flash another blow. The screens sink back into shadow, retreating the way they came. A second set descends, again, from the shadows.  


*Possibility.*  
  


The lives she could have lived.

The choices she could have made.

The better versions of herself she walked past.

Each frame glows with a kind of holiness she cannot bear to look at.  


When the last image vanishes, her breath stumbles; her mind a hurricane of jumbled scribbles trying to untangle itself. She turns toward the judge’s bench and the jury box. The lanterns flare. The shadows peel back. And the truth hits her like a collapsing cathedral.

The room, the plaintiff table, the witness box, the chamber—is empty. It has always been empty. She stands here, alone.  


The woman who drags herself into this hall again and again, resurrecting ghosts, assembling trials out of guilt and fear, sentencing herself when no one ever asked her to. It feels as if someone suddenly sucked all the pressure out of the room.

Her breath shakes as she stands, body shivering, ears popping and ringing at the same time. The once-dim lanterns now blaze with harsh clarity, as if every light in existence has turned to face her. The walls gleam like hospital white, blinding, and sterile. The polished floors now shine back at her, reflecting every flaw, every shadow.  
 

The silence is gone; every footstep she takes echoes violently, bouncing off the walls, chasing her like accusations. She approaches the judge’s bench. The wood beneath her hands feels cold; unyielding.

The gavel rests on the bench, forged from every verdict she's given to herself. She lifts it and finds it to be heavy—heavier than guilt or truth. The gavel rings—a resounding crack that rattles the rafters.  


Dust drifts. Walls quake. The echo circles back, resolving into a single word, spoken in her own voice from every corner of the empty room:  
 

""Guilty.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Set in a liminal courtroom that exists between reality and memory, *The Trial* is a psychological descent into the skeletons in Dona's closet. Here, the ghosts of love, loss, and unfinished wounds rise to testify against her. What follows is a haunting reckoning born from the mind’s darkest corridors. At its heart, this is a story about the private trials we hold against ourselves. The way guilt petrifies, the way old wounds replay in endless loops, and the inner musings of a mind that has become its own judge, jury, and executioner, long after the world has moved on.

# About This Game

If you grew up squinting at CRTs and worshipping box art, you know the era: **Amiga / early DOS**—when games like **Uninvited, Shadowgate, Deja Vu** (and cousins like **Willy Beamish, Police Quest, Ultima VII**) convinced us that pixels could hold secrets, jokes, and doom in equal measure.

**Cease To Breathe** is my love letter to that era: a **compact, non-linear** adventure set in a **demonic nowhere-house** that absolutely does not meet building codes. It’s hand-drawn pixel art, dry humor, and puzzles that respect your brain more than your patience. Try a thing. Try a different thing. Then try the clearly ridiculous thing—because it *might* work.

This isn’t a 40-hour epic. It’s a **tight evening-length adventure** you can finish, then **replay for different endings** and “I wonder if…” experiments. At **$4.99**, it’s the price of bad coffee—but far more likely to whisper back when you click the wrong skull.

# What You’ll Do

* **Poke everything.** Hundreds of interactive objects to examine, use, combine, and yeet at other objects. Curiosity is rewarded; reckless curiosity is… informative.
* **Solve fair puzzles.** Clues live in the world and in your notes, not behind moon-logic. If you can justify it, there’s a good chance the game does too.
* **Wander non-linearly.** No quest arrows, no hand-holding. Explore rooms in the order your instincts (or mistakes) demand.

# Feature Highlights

* **Hand-drawn pixel art** with that warm “somebody actually drew this” vibe.
* **Hundreds** of object interactions; many combos do something… occasionally something you regret.
* **Dry humor** baked into descriptions, failures, and the odd congratulatory insult.
* **Play your pace.** Roam, experiment, backtrack, and open the thing the game told you not to open.

# Honest Heads-Up

* **Length:** Evening-sized. If you’re hunting 20+ hours, this isn’t that.
* **Difficulty:** Clue-driven, fair, occasionally mean in a “you had it coming” way.
* **No grind, no filler, no microtransactions.** Just you, a house, and consequences.

If I had one more day, I’ve planned it to the letter
A jam-packed day to make us both feel better.
We’d start with coffee, doughnuts for breakfast;
I’d tell you what you’ve missed, like you never left us.

I’d ask you all the questions I now know I need.
I’d ask if it was really you I heard in my dream.
I’d ask if you were happy, if you’d finally found peace.
I’d memorize your voice, your touch, the you before the disease.

I’d tell you how much I love you, like you didn’t already know.
I’d hug you so tightly, like I could never let you go.
I’d try to make you laugh again, just because I could.
I’d tell you I miss you, more than I ever should.

And as our time together faded toward its end,
I’d remind you of all the little things to send
The rainbows, the robins, the random signs,
To walk in my dreams, where loss and love entwines.

And still, as much as I would treasure every borrowed minute,
A single day could never hold the world that had you in it.
Because you were my constant, my confidant, my guide
The steady kind of courage I once kept by my side.
And now the days feel heavier, the nights a little long,
As I try to find my footing in a world where you are gone.

But I’m trying, God, I’m trying to understand this ache,
To live inside a life that grief keeps trying to remake.
To see that all this longing, all this breaking, all this slow,
Is just the shape of love that has nowhere else to go.
And though one day won’t fix the hurt or make the missing end,
I’ll meet you in the moments, in the signs you sometimes send.",1,1765056882.0,poetry_critics,0,1.0,False

Having successfully beaten my *Decentralized or Destitute* challenge with my dignity mostly intact, I consider fleeing Buenos  Aires before Microcentro rewires my nervous system. I'm dangerously close to falling in love with the city but that might just be a side effect of the long-term exposure to exhaust and capybara memes.

I find a cheap flight to Jujuy. My brain floods with visions of  hiking in the Andes with my pockets full of pesos. I'll drink some wine, I'll pet a llama, maybe I'll even do some writing.

But traditional finance fails me. The airline refuses my cards. All of them. Cryptocards, debit cards, credit card from a reputable European bank.  Declined and  denied with a vague error and a customer service bot which repeatedly tells me that foreign cards are not a problem and I should check that I entered my card details correctly.

I have half a dozen new apps on my phone to pay with stablecoins. I've gone through the KYC and been accepted for most of them, so that I can test them one-by-one. Mostly they work well. I don't even need to put money in them in advance; once I know what I want to buy, I can quickly move stablecoins into the app and they appear immediately.  But the apps are no use to me for paying for online purchases; I need a person with a terminal generating a QR code to use them.

There's third-party aggregator that looks like it scraped the flight off of Google but actually allows me to pay for the flight. Just one catch: no luggage. Not even a carry on. They suggest that I buy extras separately, from the airline that cannot manage a card transaction.

Fine. I don't need  luggage.

I strip my belongings down to the essentials. There's a storage company that operates on some sort of decentralized custody protocol for personal belongings. You book online, get the address of a location somewhere in your chosen neighbourhood, and give them all of your earthly possessions.

My assigned drop point is a phone shop in San Telmo, crammed with AI-art cases and knockoff chargers. I give them my number and hand them my suitcase. All I can do is trust that the shop is still here when I return.

I take the bus to the airport wearing three layers of clothing, a spare set of underwear shoved into my handbag. I have both phones, Kindle, tablet and keyboard and a tangle of cables tucked into my hoodie pockets, looking like one of those street vendors who open up their coat and show you a wide range of goods.

At the airport, I unpack everything to pass through security. I need three trays. After I pack myself back up, a man with a wand points out that I have a cable trailing behind me.

At the gate, the Argentines start forming a queue an hour before boarding, pure social  contract magic. I stay seated like a savage until I see our plane pull up to the gate and dump its last cargo of tourists and gauchos.

I squish into the middle seat and try to keep my hoodie spilling over the sides, redistributing items until I finally get the seatbelt over my middle. I do not exhale for the entire two hour flight.

The airport is not in San Salvador and the bus to Tilcara, my chosen destination, is. I purchase a shuttle ticket and wait outside to stand in the rain until it is full and we are ready to go.

The bus station is impossibly clean and bright. A woman at an information booth appears improbably happy to see me, checks the time and tells me  which bus company has a bus leaving next which will stop at Ticara. The woman at the bus company is less happy to see me but, after realizing that I blatantly don't have a clue what I am doing, writes helpful notes in the margins of my ticket: bus will arrive in 40 minutes, somewhere between bay 08 and 13, it will say Humahuaca on the front and Evelia on the side.

I ask if they take QR payments. She points out that there is a 10% discount for cash for the ticket. I pay cash.

Forty minutes later, I wedge myself into my bus seat, attempting to take off my hoodie in a way that does not tip all of my electronics  on the floor. And then we drive. The windows fog up and all I can see outside is black rain. I am desperate not to fall asleep and end up in some abandoned village where they've never heard of Ethereum or vowels.

It's past eleven when the bus pulls into Tilcara. A cracked parking lot. A couple of guys loitering with intent. I check my phone: a 25-minute walk  to the hostel, which I had glibly told the hostel would be easy as I have no bags.

The air is thin and every road heads uphill. I can't find any street signs. The paved road quickly deteriorates into a dirt track. Shop shutters rattle closed as I walk past. When I manage to make eye contact with anyone, I get a dead stare. Every time I check my phone map, it tells me that I've gone the wrong way. Again.

I should have stayed in Buenos Aires, I think. I loved every millimeter of Buenos Aires. People mostly smiled at me, said  hello. There were coffee shops and restaurants and street lights. Here, there's just dirt and altitude.

Defiantly, I  mutter *buenas noches* under my breath at the next person coming towards me. She nods, replies. Shit. Am I supposed to be greeting people?

Two turns from my hostel, the road dips downhill. Somewhere along the way, I climbed up a hill I didn't need to. I curse the Andean gods and keep walking.

Finally, I arrive, punch in the code, and crash into my bed. It's midnight. I sleep like the dead.

And then, morning. It's like someone rewired Tilcara overnight. It's beautiful. Still dusty and crumbling but golden in the morning light with misty black and red mountains creating a backdrop that looks like a motivational poster. I discover that street signs do exist, just not where you'd expect, hand painted onto walls and fences at random heights as you walk down the road.

I scan the restaurant chalkboards, making mental lists of all the dishes I want to try, then pause, not quite emotionally ready to consider *Llama al Malbec* for my special evening meal.

Maybe tomorrow.

The locals have stern faces carved from stone until I whisper *buen día*, at which point they smile and greet me. I try it louder. Everyone seems happy to see me. Some even ask *que tál?*, how are you?, and actually seem to expect an answer.

I respond with a slump and  a wheeze,  universal code for *every road in this town is uphill and I am dying*. I am met with laughter, sympathy and one invitation to a cold beer (I should have said yes).

The hotel also gives a 10% discount for paying in cash, so I use up the rest of the pesos from Blue. I ask the woman if she knows where I can buy pesos in Tilcara.

There are two Western Unions in town and a gift shop called Native Art who will exchange dollars for pesos. But what about stablecoins?

She stares at me blankly.

Never mind, I tell her. It doesn't matter anymore.

And it really doesn't.

All of these were hatched in my main 36g tank inside a stainless steel coffee filter (*adding link and notes about that below) with feeding rings around to keep it afloat. I used an airstone with gentle airflow, a little bit of Java moss and subwassertang, broken up catappa leaves and alder cones to help with fungus. I was diligent pulling out infertile (white/milky) eggs before they had a chance to get fuzzy and spread, and my tetras enjoyed the extra treats getting dropped in lol. Being quick to pull bad eggs will make your hatch rates much higher, the fungus spreads to healthy eggs very quickly.

Once hatched, I let the hatchlings absorb their yolk sack for a day or 2, then I'll introduce a small amount of first bites, using an oral syringe and pre-mixing it with tank water in a small cup. After a day or two of first bites,  they get hikari frozen baby brine shrimp every day for breakfast, and I've been feeding 3x a day total. They all seem to be doing great and my fry survival rate seems to be about 90% doing this,  and it's extremely cheap and easy to maintain. Raising fry has been an awesome experience,  and I'm learning all the time. Maybe this can help anyone who unexpectedly ends up with eggs and wants to try to hatch them!

I remember the silence first. The whole street looked hollow, like the world had been scraped clean. My thoughts felt the same—blank, empty. But the feeling of being watched kept jabbing at my nerves.

I checked behind me.

Nothing.

Just that miserable stretch of asphalt.

The second I turned forward again, hands clamped around me. I didn’t even have time to shout. They dragged me across the pavement toward a peeling apartment door. I knew what was coming. It had already happened. Many times.

The three men said nothing. The first one raised a gun, as casual as lighting a cigarette. He put the barrel to my forehead.

The shot didn’t hurt at first. It burned. I felt metal glide through my skull and fry whatever softness lived inside my brain. I collapsed, locked in my own body, drowning in the warmth of my own blood. I couldn’t scream. Couldn’t move. I just died quietly, suffocating in myself.

Then I woke up.

Sweaty. Gasping.

For a full second, I wasn’t sure which world was real.

I went through my morning routine: shower, coffee, food.

Everything tasted wrong.

Everything felt wrong.

And every morning the same question gnawed at me:

Why do I feel my own death so clearly?

\--

November 15th, 2029

Sleep came slowly—four hours of preparation, breathing exercises, trying not to think about dying again. Then the dream snapped into place.

I was in a home I didn’t recognise, in the middle of an argument with a woman who felt like a wife I’d forgotten. We weren’t speaking the same language; she yelled, I said nothing.

I don’t know why I reached into the couch cushion and pulled out a knife. I don’t know why I felt like I was about to use it.

Before I could move, she stormed back into the room holding a gun. The look in her eyes wasn’t human.

She aimed. Fired.

Same spot. Same numb collapse.

Two dreams in a row—same death.

But this time I didn’t wake up.

This time I kept lying there, bleeding out, growing colder. My vision dimmed slowly, like someone lowering a lantern. Somewhere behind me, gravel crunched under footsteps.

An old man sat down beside me.

“Mind if I join you, young man?”

I woke up already sitting upright, shaking violently, like something had yanked me back into my body.

\--

January 7th, 2030

Two months since I saw him.

I know he was real.

Nothing in dreams ever sounds real—their physics are wrong, their voices hollow.

But his feet on the gravel were solid. Heavy. Alive.

I haven’t dreamt since.

\--

April 23rd, 2030

Five months of peaceful darkness.

No death. No waking up screaming.

My days felt long but bearable. I got work done. I felt human again.

Then I closed my eyes tonight, hoping for more darkness.

But I forgot falling asleep.

The dream swallowed me instantly.

A park.

Empty. Silent.

No sun. No moon. Just a dull glow leaking from the sky.

And behind me:

“Sit, cutie,” he whispered. “It’ll all be over soon.”

The old man’s face was wrong. Rotting. Skin crawling with tiny pale worms. His voice dripped honey and filth.

I managed to speak this time. “What the fuck is this?”

He looked almost bored.

“Do you really enjoy dying?”

“…sometimes,” I admitted without understanding why.

He studied me for a long, punishing silence.

“You know you can make it permanent, right?""

I suddenly woke up coughing blood.

\--

May 3rd, 2030

Ten days awake.

No sleep.

Hallucinations crawling on the walls.

I can’t stay awake anymore.

I’ll die for real if I try.

Tonight I’m going back in.

The candles help. The breathing helps. I fall asleep in an hour.

The park again.

A shadow figure on the swing set.

Ignoring me.

Then the old man appeared at my side, like he’d always been sitting there.

“You know you can end everything anytime,” he murmured.

“That’d kill me.”

“Exactly.”

He pulled out a gun and shot me point-blank.

The bullet turned to ash on my forehead, but I still felt it tunnel through my mind—just for a fraction.

“So what’s the point?” I asked, trembling.

“To experience what I have. For the next five hundred years or so.”

My stomach knotted. “You’re insane.”

“I did it,” he said. “So can you.”

Two men with rifles walked out of the trees.

He didn’t warn me.

They both shot through my body.

The bullets ripped through my organs and pushed them aside, massive clots escaping my torso.

Every second of it was pure.

\--

May 4th, 2030

I’m becoming like him.

A masochist of the worst kind.

Tonight I end it.

I fall asleep already gripping the decision in my mind.

Back in the park.

“So this is the one?” the old man asked.

“Yes.” I handed him a Beretta I didn’t remember holding. “Shoot me in the head. Make it real.”

“Kid,” he sighed, “if it were that easy, I’d have left this place a millennium ago.”

My throat tightened. “So what—I’m trapped here forever?”

“No,” he said gently, almost fatherly. “We can try together.”

I raised the gun to my temple.

My hand shook so violently I thought the barrel would slip.

His rotting fingers wrapped around mine.

He pulled the trigger with me.

The bullet crawled through my skull in slow motion—warm, slicing, absolute. My brain folded around it like melting butter. I felt the moment the world let go of me.

And then—

Nothing.

Real nothing.

\--

December 8th, 2030

It took seven months for my body to wake up.

A chunk of my skull gone.

Half a year unable to feed myself, move right, or think clearly.

Since then, I haven’t dreamt once.

Part of me misses it.

Part of me is terrified.

Every night before sleep, I ask myself the same question:

What would’ve happened if I’d stayed in the dreams?

Tonight, as the warmth pulls me under, I hear gravel footsteps beside my bed.

A familiar voice whispers:

1pg0iee,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMNRInvestors/comments/1pg0iee/tokenization_future/,Tokenization Future,"Where do you see tokenization going?

So we have the tokenization of currency.
The next seems to be tokenizing stocks, including private companies. 

The idea is tokenizing real world assets.  I’ve heard talk about tokenizing property, especially for being able to take a stake in an investment property.  I’ve heard of a company where you could have a stake in an individual coffee shop like a Starbucks, so this kind of makes sense to me.

Tom has discussed about tokenizing Tesla’s performance for a set time or area.  He said this is a blending with poly markets.  I see this like kind of like sports betting like an over/under on a certain outcome of a match rather than ownership of the any asset.  Options are kind of like an extended bet on an underlying asset, so tokenization seems to be an extension of that.  

Some things I don’t see as possible due to regulatory roadblocks.  For example, I don’t think you could tokenize and sell your house online.  

Tom’s talk about a 1971 moment I see as tokenizing being an opportunity to expand the markets through more accessibility of assets that are currently very illiquid.  This creates an 
expansion and valuation of the financial markets through the speeding up of the velocity of market transactions and thus an in increase in the all financial markets valuations.  
This is how markets expanded from 1971 because with money no longer having to be backed by gold, it was easier to expand the money supply through financial products that didn’t have to be backed by anything.

I guess the idea is that there are so many use cases and not everything has to hit, but rather with all these possible opportunities, moderate adoption of a few or a homerun on one aspect could really bump eth price.

# About This Game

If you grew up squinting at CRTs and worshipping box art, you know the era: **Amiga / early DOS**—when games like **Uninvited, Shadowgate, Deja Vu** (and cousins like **Willy Beamish, Police Quest, Ultima VII**) convinced us that pixels could hold secrets, jokes, and doom in equal measure.

**Cease To Breathe** is my love letter to that era: a **compact, non-linear** adventure set in a **demonic nowhere-house** that absolutely does not meet building codes. It’s hand-drawn pixel art, dry humor, and puzzles that respect your brain more than your patience. Try a thing. Try a different thing. Then try the clearly ridiculous thing—because it *might* work.

This isn’t a 40-hour epic. It’s a **tight evening-length adventure** you can finish, then **replay for different endings** and “I wonder if…” experiments. At **$4.99**, it’s the price of bad coffee—but far more likely to whisper back when you click the wrong skull.

# What You’ll Do

* **Poke everything.** Hundreds of interactive objects to examine, use, combine, and yeet at other objects. Curiosity is rewarded; reckless curiosity is… informative.
* **Solve fair puzzles.** Clues live in the world and in your notes, not behind moon-logic. If you can justify it, there’s a good chance the game does too.
* **Wander non-linearly.** No quest arrows, no hand-holding. Explore rooms in the order your instincts (or mistakes) demand.

# Feature Highlights

* **Hand-drawn pixel art** with that warm “somebody actually drew this” vibe.
* **Hundreds** of object interactions; many combos do something… occasionally something you regret.
* **Dry humor** baked into descriptions, failures, and the odd congratulatory insult.
* **Play your pace.** Roam, experiment, backtrack, and open the thing the game told you not to open.

# Honest Heads-Up

* **Length:** Evening-sized. If you’re hunting 20+ hours, this isn’t that.
* **Difficulty:** Clue-driven, fair, occasionally mean in a “you had it coming” way.
* **No grind, no filler, no microtransactions.** Just you, a house, and consequences.

# For the Nostalgic

If “try everything on everything” was your childhood mantra, you’ll feel at home. If you’ve never played those classics, congratulations: you get the good parts without the disk swapping.",1,1765056424.0,itchio,0,1.0,False

I’m 20 weeks pregnant and have had the absolute worst digestive problems all pregnancy - diarrhoea (the unexpected kind) and constipation. Before pregnancy I was so regular and barely had any issues so it’s been a struggle. BUT over the last few weeks I’m been doing a few things and I feel like they’ve kicked my digestion back into regular gear and I feel somewhat myself again (although maybe it’s just the timing of where I’m at in pregnancy). Also this may only be relevant to those based in Australia as I’m not sure of international availability. 

- Brookfarm Gluten Free Cacao Granola! Have with yoghurt of choice, fruit, honey. 
- Land essentials daily lemon powder. I have this first thing in warm water instead of coffee and it’s been incredible! 
- Apple cider vinegar on all my salads 
- the Mother Natal pregnancy multi. This is the best one I’ve tried and I’ve tried many! 

Hope I help just one other person struggling with awfullll digestion at this stage of pregnancy.

I really need some help from people who went through long-term caffeine withdrawal or metabolism issues after quitting coffee.

I’m 21 years old and used to drink extremely high amounts of coffee since childhood — up to 15 cups a day on an empty stomach, every single day, for years. I suddenly quit two years ago and since then I’ve been stuck with symptoms that look like hypothyroidism, even though all my blood tests (thyroid, vitamins, minerals, hormones) are completely normal.

My symptoms are:
	•	Puffy/swollen face
	•	Dry hair and hair loss
	•	Skin looking loose/flaccid
	•	Low energy and slow metabolism feeling
	•	Overall feeling like my body is “slowed down”

Doctors say my labs are normal, so it may be receptor desensitization from years of extreme caffeine use. But it has been almost 2 years, and I honestly feel hopeless.

My question is:
👉 For those who went through long-term caffeine withdrawal, when did you actually start to notice real improvement?
I need real timelines from people who lived something similar.
Did it take 1 year? 2 years? 3 years?
When did your metabolism and appearance start to come back?

Even though I’ve played off and on for 8 years, I’ve never actually made it to the gold mine. 

So I trekked through Mystery Lake, Pleasant Valley, and Timberwolf Mountain, eventually reaching Ash Canyon. Things are going well so far, haven’t even run into any timberwolves or cougars. I decide to stop in rock shelf cave to rest before the big climb and drink some birch tea since I’ve lost about half my condition at this point hiking in the cold… only to realize I forgot my sleeping pad and cooking cans in a cave in Timberwolf Mountain. 

***Fuck.***

It’s so cold out that even with all of my very respectable gear, I’m freezing in the back of the cave. I make a fire and pass some time in hopes that the weather lets up, and after a few hours it does. Only now, I’m exhausted. I need to be able to sleep. 

I make a snow shelter at the mouth of the cave and set up a fire with five hours of fuel, losing even more condition while I gather the firewood. Things have turned dire at this point, but the fire will keep me warm and I’ll be able to sleep… only a very short storm comes through and wipes out my fire after not even an hour. I am on the verge of hypothermia again and my condition is around 20%. I gather as many sticks as I can find and retreat back into the cave to make another pitiful fire to try and warm up. After a couple of hours, the sun has set but it has begun to warm up. 

At this point I will freeze to death if I try to go back for my sleeping pad, and I am running out of cat stalks fast. My only hope is to get up into the mine, but I am nearly fully drained on fatigue. But I have to try. 

I meander in the dark over to the first climbing rope, ready to load up on coffee (which definitely wouldn’t have worked) when I find a snow shelter. Thankfully, it was just warm enough outside that I could sleep and stay warm. I slept for an hour at a time, slowly recouping some stamina, and the weather kept. 

Now at about 25% condition, with 2/3 of my fatigue bar recovered, I guzzle some coffee and begin the climb. Eventually I make it, and stumble into the mine, condition at ~10%. I am able to spend a couple of days in the mine, healing up and eating ptarmigan and rabbit. After I get my condition up to ~60%, it’s time to head back. 

Eventually I reach Timberwolf Mountain, and I have to climb down the rope to get to the cave South of the climbing spot where I left my sleeping pad. I am a couple of kg encumbered though, and pretty fatigued, so I greedily decide to try and scale the rock face instead of using the rope. Bad decision.

After making it down a little ways. I reach a point where the snow overhangs the cliff and I am not able to catch the rock face. I fall. Somehow I survive the fall, but my condition is now at ~15%. I sprint to the cave, but I am out of food. I find a ravaged deer carcass and have no choice but to stop and harvest a kg of steak. I make it to the cave just as a storm rolls in. I am forced to make a fire using my last 2 birch bark as it’s my only tinder, and sleep the night. The blizzard hasn’t let up though, if anything it’s gotten worse, and I have ran out of firewood. I am freezing to death in the cave and once again almost out of food. I know there is a prepper cache close by, but I am unfamiliar with the area and the storm is making visibility impossible. Still, it’s my only shot. I down my only energy drink, run out into the storm, and scale the hill praying I find this prepper cache, not sure if there will be any food there, but knowing if I can find it it will at least be warm. Eventually out of the corner of my eye I spot the hatch through the blizzard, but I’m not out of the woods yet. I stumble toward the hatch at ~5% condition and enter. I light up my lantern and my jaw drops; there are abundant supplies, food, water, tea, hides, rare tools, enough to last me several days while I heal. I’ve found a literal oasis, the only possible thing that could have saved my life. 

I spend a few days in this prepper cache healing up before trekking everything out in my travois to the mountaineer hut, where I now remain until I can make it back to Mystery Lake, where I am very excited to live relatively stress free for the foreseeable future after having cheated death more than once.

50g/2oz 99% dark chocolate

3-5TBSP Allulose

1 tsp Instant coffee powder (optional) 

- Chop chocolate finely and place into a metal bowl 

- Add Allulose and coffee powder to 1/2 Cup full cream and heat on the stove on low-medium heat until bubbles start forming on the rim of the pot 

- Pour the hot mixture over the chopped chocolate and wait about 2min until the chocolate has completely melted 

- Whisk until smooth and let cool down completely 

- Add 1/2 cup full cream from the fridge and whip up with an electric whisk/mixer . It doesn’t take very long ~1-2min to get to a smooth, fluffy texture. Don’t overwork it, so it won’t split 

- Chill in the fridge for at least 3h (preferably overnight) 

- Enjoy. 😊

Some guy yelling about the border, the TV volume just high enough that you could feel the consonants through the glass. Dad always said you had to turn it up to hear over the dishwasher, even though the dishwasher died years ago and he never replaced it.

I knocked anyway. Habit. Then let myself in.

He was in his chair, of course. Same brown recliner from my childhood, now with a permanent Dad-shaped dip baked into the middle. He didn’t look up right away. Just grunted, pen moving over a folded section of the Viridian Gazette.

“Hey,” I said, dropping my duffel by the couch. “I’m here.”

He finished his sentence, jabbed a period, then looked up with a grin.

“Well, there she is. You make good time?”

“Hit green lights all the way in,” I said. “You’d have been proud.”

That made him smile, quick and crooked. For a second he looked like my dad again. The dad from the driver’s-ed parking lot, patiently sitting through too-hard brakes and snail-pace turns.

He flipped the paper closed and tapped it with his pen. “Did you see what they did to the intersection at Palmer and Sixth?”

I had. They’d put in one of those new four-way things with a delayed left arrow. The kind of change normal people complain about once and then forget.

“They’ve got these kids flying through the yellow,” he said. “No respect for timing. No respect for right of way. Somebody’s going to get T-boned.”

He slid the paper toward me. His handwriting filled the letters column.

To Whom It May Concern: As a retired citizen and taxpayer of this town for forty-two years…

Words like reckless and idiotic design and complete disregard for safety blinked up at me. He’d underlined proper use of traffic signals twice.

“You’re writing manifestos now,” I said.

“They asked for feedback,” he said.

This from the man who once took both hands off the wheel to clap along to “Joy to the World” on I-35 while I shrieked in the passenger seat.

The TV cut to commercials. Dad muted it automatically, then started in on gas prices, eggs, how “they” were killing the middle class.

I nodded in all the right places. Two days here. I was trying to make it through Hour One without starting a fight.

“Have you eaten?” I asked when he paused to sip his coffee.

“Not yet. Thinking about pancakes.”

For half a second I pictured him in his old T-shirt, spatula in hand, Three Dog Night blaring from the radio perched on top of the fridge.

 “We can go down to Patty’s. They’ve got a senior special.”

“Sure,” I said. “Sounds good.”

He brightened at that and pushed himself out of the recliner, not struggling, just older. “Let me change. They keep it like a meat locker in there.”

While he was in the bedroom, I looked around the kitchen. His fishing calendar was still on the fridge, stuck there with a Yellowstone magnet. It was turned to April, even though it was June. The square for today was blank.

When he came back, he’d changed into his “good shorts” and a polo. He grabbed his keys from the ceramic bowl by the door, the one I made in third grade.

We got into his truck, and before he even buckled he was talking about gas prices. The number on the station sign. The number when he got his license. How he used to fill a tank for less than a burger. 

At the stoplight on Palmer and Sixth, he gestured with his chin. “There. See? Arrow’s too damn short. Three cars, max.”

The light cycled. Two cars made it through before it turned red again. The third stopped. He shook his head, vindicated.

Patty’s was half full.

“Hey, Mr. Collins,” the hostess said. She was maybe 19, with a nose stud and a little crescent-moon tattoo on her wrist.

“Morning,” Dad said. “Got our booth?”

“You know it.”

She led us to the familiar red vinyl corner booth.

Dad ordered the short stack with bacon, eggs over medium, coffee.

“Fruit bowl, please,” I said. “And coffee.”

Dad watched her go, then leaned in.

“Remember when you used to make Mickey Mouse pancakes?” I said. “With the chocolate chip eyes?”

“Yeah.” He chuckled. “You always wanted too many chocolate chips. Dumped half the bag in the batter.”

“You let me.”

“I let you once. You puked on the couch.”

The memory warmed the air between us for about three seconds.

Then he started again, “Nowadays they put kids on iPads and call that parenting. No wonder nobody knows how to use a damn stoplight. No wonder they all run crying to the government when they can’t handle life.”

I gave him a look. Mom’s look. Eyebrows say it all.

“I’m not talking about you,” he said. “You know how to work. I’m talking about the ones on TikTok.”

The waitress returned with our plates. Dad looked at his like an insult.

“I said over medium,” he said, poking an egg. The yolk broke instantly. “This is over easy. It’s runny.”

“I can take it back—” she started.

“No, no. I don’t have all day. Just tell the cook medium means medium. And these pancakes are smaller than they used to be.”

“Okay,” she said, cheeks flushed.

“Service has really gone downhill,” he muttered. “No one wants to work anymore.”

“She didn’t cook it, Dad,” I said. “She’s just bringing the plates.”

I ate my fruit bowl. It tasted fine. Not like his Sunday morning feast, but fine.

“You been out on the boat lately?” I asked. “River looks good this time of year.”

“Too much hassle,” he said. “Trailer’s a pain. Water levels are all over. Last time I went, some fool on a Jet Ski cut right across my bow. Bunch of idiots out there.”

He kept talking. I tried to remember the last time he’d been on the river. He’d been retired nine years, selectively outraged for eight-and-a-half.



When we got back to the house he turned Fox back on without thinking. Same anchor, different suit, same crisis.

Dad settled into his recliner and started to snore softly. I gathered the cups and crumbs from the table.

“You need anything?” he mumbled.

“Just tidying,” I said.

He nodded and slipped back under, mouth open. The anchor’s voice rose and fell with outrage and certainty. The blueprint of his new personality.

So I met her again. I really wanted a hug, I wanted to hug her, but I couldn’t. She is again going to her hometown tomorrow… far from me. I don’t know if I can see her again. I don’t want to leave her but I can’t, because my heart won’t listen to me. No matter how far she goes from me, she always stays in my heart. And if I leave her… she doesn’t want me anyway.

This time I saw her crying. I saw it.
Why did she choose me just to leave me again? She could’ve told me. She could’ve told me she wanted to stay with me, but she didn’t. So what’s the issue? Everything was going smoothly, so why did she leave me? Still I carry her in my memory. She was never a “choice.” I always chose her, no matter what. No matter what it cost — even my life.

She was like my cigarette.
How can I leave her?
I know she is dangerous to my health.

“Marne ke liye bhi ready hun.”
It’s not like I can leave her. As close as she can be, I can’t keep her close. I don’t judge her past or her present. I know I’m selfish. No matter what… how do I tell her what she was to me? She is my happiness. If a cigarette doesn’t last long, then how can she last long? How can our relation last?

So I removed her from everything. Like everything — Snap, Insta, WhatsApp. Still she added me back on Snap. I didn’t want to meet her; I didn’t want closure. I wanted to die with her memories. Who will explain to her what she meant to me?

So today she added me on Snap. I texted her, “Are you all right?” I sent a snap video, “Are you good?”

She took time to answer.
I waited.
Then I got a text back:

“Actually I wanted to apologise for how I had behaved with you. Even if you did love me, I didn’t reciprocate it. And now I get it, how it feels to be not loved.”
“So I’m very sorry for the way I had been with you. You didn’t deserve it.”

This was her text. How could I ignore it?
In my mind a lot of things started going on.
Is she all right?
Did something happen to her?
Something didn’t feel right.

Even though I deleted her number, still I remember it. How can I forget her number? I didn’t forget her first look, so how can I forget her number? Till now at night it’s still “good night,” morning it’s her name only. How can I forget her number?

I called her.
Ring… ring… ring…
After four rings she picked up.

Pin-drop silence on both ends.
No talking.
I was holding a cigarette, thinking about her.
I just said, “Hi… are you good? Everything is good? Are you all right?”
She said, “Hi, I’m good.”

Then again silence.

I didn’t know what to talk to her. It’s been a long time since I spoke to her. Her voice didn’t change at all. Nothing changed with her. Nothing. Same everything. Because of the silence, we didn’t talk much. I walked to a cigarette shop for another cigarette, still not knowing what to say. Then I told her, “Okay then… bye,” with a heavy heart. I didn’t know what she would say. She hung up.

Later I saw her Snap. That’s when I got to know she still stays in BTM Layout. We both are staying so close. It’s hardly 50 meters from her PG to mine. We are staying this close — I can smell her in the air. How can I stay away from her when she’s this close? It’s just destiny.

So I forgot about it, I’ll continue — sorry for spoilers.

I saw the snap — the guy in the same mascot costume, like the Disney-type doll costume, the same one I had sent her long ago.
Long ago we both used to notice the same flowers, the same everything, the same paths. We walked the same roads but never came across each other. Never met. Seeing that snap I realised we both were living in the same area — BTM Layout.

So I texted her back, “Is it BTM Layout, right?”
She said, “Yesss.”

I asked where she lives. She said something like Madiwala. I told her it’s very near. I went to meet her again. I called her, but she didn’t pick — she was talking to someone else.

Me and my friend went to Madiwala to see where she was staying. I was looking at every window thinking she might be there. I was searching for her because the last Snap I saw was her smoking near a window — just a snap holding a cigarette.

I had another friend also in the meantime, to get company, to change my mind about her. How could I tell my friends that I was looking for her? So I didn’t tell them. We went to Madiwala, had tea. They were watching other girls. I was only looking for her. In my eyes, she was the only one. No one else.

While going back, I called her again. It came busy.
I didn’t disturb her.
I lost hope.
She was never going to meet me.

I believed in “korgajaaa.”
I prayed.
But no snap, no message, nothing.
I lost hope.

While returning back, I got her call.
I got a call from her.
I got a fucking callback from her.

I was so excited I can’t tell you in words. I was on the clouds. While talking I asked where she was staying, what she was doing. She said she was searching for a job. She didn’t get a job. I had a referral; I told her I could help her.

She said she stays near the metro, hardly 10 meters away. I didn’t know which PG. I told many PG names. Then I came near the metro. While on call, she said she saw me.

My heartbeat went crazy. I can’t explain how it felt.

I was wearing old clothes, the same crocs I wore during my accident. She said she was coming down. I waited for her. I couldn’t control my excitement. I wanted to hug her when she came down, but I controlled myself. She wanted the friendship boundary, so I just gave a hand-to-hand fist bump.

She looked the same to me.
Nothing changed.
I saw her eyes — tired… but she was an angel to me. How do I explain her beauty? If I saw God, I would see Him in her face. Long hair, black hoodie, Buddha chain on her neck. The same chain on her hand. She didn’t give me eye contact because she knew I would fall again and again. She avoided it.

What do I say? Goddess in the form of a human. She is the one. I couldn’t stop mesmerising her. She became a little fat, chubby — I could see it in her face. It was okay. She was the same for me in every way.

She is mature, talks less. I was the one talking too much, sharing everything. I felt relieved. We three walked — my friend was there, ignore him. Walking in the cold Bangalore weather with her felt like heaven. I knew it wouldn’t last long, but I enjoyed the small walk.

I told her everything — my work, freelancing, Wyshkit, my future. She didn’t speak much. My cutie. She said she wanted to smoke. I knew the place. At 12 everything closes in Bangalore. I took her to a guy who comes every night to sell tea and coffee; he also sells cigarettes. It’s opposite the petrol bunk. We three went there. She smokes Advance. I always smoked Shift or lighter ones, but today I was with her — how could I smoke Shift? Long ago in Manipal we shared Advance — our kiss. How could I smoke anything else today?

My friend took Shift, and we both took Advance. We smoked. Then we went to leave her. Heavy-hearted.
How could I leave her?
This was her last day in Bangalore.

Near my PG she was staying all these months — since March. And I’d been here four months. Now it’s December. How can our story end like this?

We went near her PG.
My heart felt heavy.

In between I kept searching for her eyes. Deep, unforgettable eyes. She wasn’t giving eye contact.

We reached her PG.
She was leaving tomorrow — going to her hometown.
Leaving me.

The cigarette ended.
Our conversation ended.
I could see the tiredness in her eyes. I could see her from head to toe, live, not in some friend’s story. She was standing in front of me. I couldn’t say goodbye. It was too hard.

I wanted to give her a fist bump again, didn’t want to cross the line we had crossed before. Still, in front of me, still I didn’t dare to hug her. Didn’t tell her how much I missed her. Didn’t tell her she was in my everyday without knowing. Didn’t tell her she was in my prayers. Didn’t tell her anything.

Just a fist bump.
Just a fist bump.
Just a fist bump.

I saw her eyes getting watery.
She was about to cry.
She wasn’t leaving because she wanted to leave me. She left because she thinks there’s no future for us. No “us.”
I’m alone with her memory. She left me. I couldn’t say “don’t leave.”

I’m not worthy of her love.
Why does it end like this every time?
Why can’t she fight for what she wants from me?

She left.
I stayed in that moment.
She went inside her PG.
I sat downstairs, cried.
Didn’t know what to say. Didn’t know what to think.

Is this the last goodbye?
I don’t know when I’ll see her again.
I don’t know when I’ll see myself in her eyes again.

Cold-hearted, crying, I went back to my PG.

1pg09r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1pg09r5/my_partner_makes_effort_to_buy_me_presents_which/,My partner makes effort to buy me presents which he thinks I like but he always gets it wrong.,"My partner of 20 years likes to suprise me with nice Christmas presents which he thinks I'll like but he just never gets it right. Some of the previous gifts were: a coffee maker that uses pods (I never said it's something I'd like and he knows we both hate weak coffee that comes out of these pods, also non recyclable pod, environment ect) a bread maker(I have never expressed any desire to make bread, I gave it a go a couple of times, tried different recipes, all of them were a flop) earphones (I asked for inexpensive skullkandy, he got me Airpod knock offs which I couldn't use due to their shape). I hate spending money on unnecessary junk and I have donated or gifted these items to other people and he was always slightly upset that I didn't hold onto them.


He did get me a couple of nice gifts over the years and I did really appreciate those. I also try to get him nice gifts that I know he wants but won't spend that money on himself. It's usually nice electronics and I spend time researching them before I buy.

To prevent getting things I don't want, I am very explicit as to what I'd like to get coming up to Christmas time. Two months ago I told him that I'd like to get and IPL device but I stressed that I will do additional research into it as I want to get a good quality device but don't want him to break his bank. The last couple of months have been busy with kids and I was looking at buying presents for my family including my partner so I didn't get a chance to look into what I want for myself exactly. I finally got some time to pick a device I want and send him a link. He came over to me and said he already ordered something because I never told him what I want exactly. He said it has 5 star reviews and told me the brand name. I looked into it and it's a cheap low quality product with more bad reviews than good across different platforms. He got slightly annoyed that I took too long with letting him know what I want and I am disappointed that he picked something without asking me first. 

Am I wrong to ask him to return the gift (it's a laser that's used on skin and can potentially cause burns and irritation). I feel like he could have waited or ask me before he made the decision himself.

I know it seems a bit much and it's just gifts but we don't generally treat ourselves during the year and spend more money on kids than ourselves so I think it's important to get it right if we're splashing out once a year.

I have been feeling major benefits of being off all caffeine for two months. Ive been feeling essentially the opposite of what follows.

I’ve been sick in bed for a week and today I thought I’d have a coffee in the morning to just give myself energy and get some stuff done. I guess I’ve just forgotten that IT IS NOT ENERGY. It’s some other demon possession from hell! I absolutely hate how it makes me feel. I get energy with no calories. I’m so hungry without acknowledging it. I just want to suck the coffee down and get that milky, sugary goodness into me like a baby, then have to go to the toilet straight away, still hungry but can’t feel it, go out but not want to be around all those people, come home but feel like a bee in a bottle, not know where to start on 40 tasks, still not have eaten lunch, laugh about something crazy, text everyone, feel exhausted, still no food, talk and overanalyze everything, start to pull at my hair (ocd/trich behavior), feel tired but wired, can’t focus on a book or show, get depressed bc I’m here again, look forward to a bad night’s sleep. It’s like being a demented baby.

It’s so, so crazy to put myself in this same situation over and over and each time feel like I’m growing so much, then have to drink this anti-growth pesticide juice and go back to square 1 again. I won’t drink it again, but does anyone have any thoughts on the type of self sabotage I’m describing? Why do so many of us stay in this anti-growth loop for so long?!

He was still strikingly handsome, but now carried the unmistakable air of a man in power. The moment he saw me, the cool composure he’d worn just seconds before vanished. He didn't even notice the coffee sloshing onto his prosecutor's uniform as he lunged forward and grabbed my hand.

""Anika. It's been a long time.""

He paused, his gaze shifting to the man who was drunkenly shouting inside the mediation room behind me.

""You've been with a man like this all these years? Did he lay a hand on you? Don't worry, I'll help you with the divorce—""

I cut him off, politely extricating my hand.

""I'm sorry, Prosecutor Martin, but your position gives you no right to interfere in my affairs.""

Besides, the man in that room was just my cousin's ex-husband.

He seemed to sigh, a wave of resignation washing over his features.

""Anika, after all this time, you still hate me.""

I smiled but said nothing.

I didn't have that much time to waste on hating him.

I had let go long ago.

...

I had certainly hated Jared Martin.

The second year of our marriage was the year my hatred for him was at its peak.

The day I found out I was pregnant was also his birthday. I did two things.

First, I went to the hospital and had the pregnancy terminated.

Second, I had the unformed embryo preserved as a specimen and gave it to him as a birthday present.

Watching the blood drain from his face as he opened the box, I smiled. ""Happy birthday. Do you like your gift?""

For the first time, I saw the mask of calm self-control he always wore begin to crumble.

Jared carefully set the box aside, and before I could react, he slammed me down onto the dining table. My body sank into the birthday cake, the sickly sweet frosting smearing all over me.

His eyes were bloodshot, his breathing ragged. ""Anika, that was your child too! Do you hate me so much because of what happened?""

My breath hitched, but I pushed down the stabbing pain in my chest and laughed. ""Yes, Jared. I hate you. You destroyed my family. Why should you get to be happy when my life is in ruins?""

But it hadn't always been like this between us.

We'd had our happy times. We were once seen as the golden couple, a match made in heaven.

Jared was an orphan my family had sponsored. We grew up together. In my memory, we were never apart for more than a month. He was cold and distant to everyone but me.

If I casually mentioned my feet were tired, he’d crouch down without a word of complaint and carry me home on his back.

When I got my period and stained my clothes, he would quietly wash them for me, his face a stoic mask.

He once ditched a major academic competition just to be with me at the hospital when I was sick.

Falling in love with Jared felt as inevitable as breathing.

Later, he achieved his dream of becoming a prosecutor. The first thing he did with his first paycheck was buy lavish gifts for my family. He held my hand and knelt before my parents, vowing, ""I swear I will spend my life protecting this family, and protecting Anika.""

But on our wedding night, his intern, Serena Walsh, tearfully accused my father of rape.

Jared promised me he would prove my father's innocence. I believed him.

But at the trial, he was the one who submitted the security footage of my father helping a drunk Serena into a hotel room.

My father was sentenced to five years. Our family home was seized. My mother died of a broken heart.

I ran through the pouring rain to find Jared, only to see Serena sitting in our living room, wearing my pajamas. He, a man who never cooked, was walking out of the kitchen with a plate of food.

A chill cut through me, colder than the rain. I smashed everything I could get my hands on. He just watched me, his voice devoid of emotion.

""The verdict reflects justice. The law does not deceive anyone. Serena has developed severe psychological trauma because of your father. This is what your family owes her. As your husband, I have a responsibility to her.""

From then on, ""responsibility"" became his excuse.

If Serena whispered, ""Jared, I'm scared,"" he would leave me, even if I was running a fever.

If she said, ""Jared, I want you to stay with me,"" he would cancel our anniversary dinner.

I tried to find a lawyer to appeal my father's case, but Jared's influence in the legal community was too great. No one dared to take it.

Over two years, the love I had left was ground into hatred by his daily betrayals. We went from a loving couple to two people who couldn't stand the sight of each other. Another second in the same room felt like suffocation.

The memories, a tangled web of pain, resurfaced. I lunged at Jared, sinking my teeth into his neck.

He shoved me away. His phone rang. Seeing the name on the screen, a rare softness flickered in his eyes.

""What is it, Serena?"" His voice was so gentle it could have been liquid honey.

Serena's trembling sobs came through the phone. ""Jared, I had the nightmare again… about being assaulted. I'm so scared.""

Jared's eyes flickered to me, a moment's hesitation, and then he grabbed his coat. ""I'm on my way.""

The door slammed shut, leaving me crumpled on the floor like a discarded rag.

Only when the echo of the door faded did I allow myself to break. Tears streamed down my face.

I told myself this was the last time I would ever cry for him. From this day forward, he would never stir another ripple in my heart.

I opened a text from Rich Gad. My fingers trembled as I typed: ""I'll do it. I'll crash your wedding in fifteen days. The condition is you get my father out of prison.""

The moment the message sent, the ""typing..."" indicator appeared at the top of the screen, as if Rich had been waiting on the other end for my reply.

His message came through instantly:

【As you wish. I'll be waiting for you on the Amalfi Coast. Don't disappoint me.】

I woke to a gray, overcast sky.

Today was the anniversary of my mother's death.

The cemetery was shrouded in a damp, clinging chill. I placed a bouquet of white lilies on her grave, her favorite flower.

I knelt, my fingers gently tracing the warm, kind face in the photograph on her headstone.

""Mom, I'm here to see you.""

""Don't worry. I'm doing well... really.""

""I will get to the bottom of Dad's case. I'll get him out, and he will walk free with his head held high. Everyone who owes our family a debt will pay. I won't let a single one of them go.""

""Just watch me, from up there.""

After leaving the cemetery, I slowly walked towards the place I once called home.

A notification popped up on my phone—Serena's new social media post.

It was a picture of Jared's focused profile, the caption reading: ""First time prepping for a trial. So lucky to have Jared patiently guiding me. He says the law protects justice, and he is my justice and my faith.""

There was a time when that kind of devotion was mine alone.

I curled my lip into a sneer, took a screenshot, and sent it to a group chat with three words: 【Perfect match.】

A sick sense of satisfaction bloomed in my chest at the thought of the storm I was about to unleash.

When I opened the front door, Serena was nestled against Jared's side, her eyes red and swollen. She shrank behind him when she saw me.

Jared patted her back, his eyes full of disappointment as he looked at me. ""That's enough, Anika. Serena is innocent.""

""Innocent? Jared, there's a limit to being blind and deaf,"" I said coldly.

He shot to his feet. ""I don't want to fight with you. Serena has a therapy appointment. You're not stable either. You're going with her.""

""Are you insane, or am I?"" The absurdity of it was staggering.

""This isn't a request."" He grabbed my arm and dragged me to the counseling center.

The moment the door to the consultation room closed, Serena's face changed. A triumphant smirk played on her lips. ""Doesn't feel good, does it? Nothing ever happened with your father. I stole the 'evidence.' I forged everything. I just wanted to see your perfect little family destroyed. I couldn't stand the sight of you looking down on everyone!""

The dam of my hatred burst. I swung my hand and slapped her, hard.

CRACK. The door was thrown open. Jared stood there, his face a thunderous mask.

Serena immediately grabbed his arm, crying, ""Jared, I was just trying to make peace with her! I don't know why she hit me!""

""Jared, did you hear her? She admitted it! She admitted to framing my father!"" My voice trembled with rage.

His brow furrowed deeper, his voice turning to ice. ""Enough. The evidence was conclusive. How long are you going to keep deceiving yourself? It's time to accept that your father is a rapist.""

His words pierced through my last defense.

""Is that what you've thought all along?""

He looked away, his voice low and firm as he spoke to the doctor outside the door. ""She's extremely unstable, exhibiting aggressive and delusional behavior. She needs immediate intervention.""

Serena chimed in at the perfect moment. ""Jared, Professor Miller on the third floor is the best for this.""

Jared nodded.

I was dragged upstairs against my will, only to realize that the ""third floor"" wasn't a consultation room. It was a treatment room, filled with cold, sterile equipment.

Orderlies strapped me into a metal chair, binding my hands and feet with leather restraints.

Serena picked up an electrode. A powerful electric current shot through my body. ""Remember,"" she hissed, ""your father is a rapist.""

""He's not!"" I bit my lip until I tasted blood.

She increased the voltage. Again and again.

I don't know how many times I was shocked. My consciousness drifted in and out of the searing pain.

""Just say 'he is,' and I'll make them stop,"" Serena cooed.

I struggled to lift my head. ""Come closer,"" I rasped. ""I'll say it.""

The moment she leaned in, I kicked out with all my remaining strength, slamming my foot into her stomach.

As she screamed and crumpled to the floor, I managed to free one hand and undo the restraints. I scrambled for the door, but the handle wouldn't turn.

""Get her!"" Serena shrieked.

Just as they were about to grab me again, I turned and charged at her, wrapping my arms around her and slamming us both into the plate-glass window.

""I always repay my debts, Serena!""

The glass shattered. We fell, tangled together, from the third floor.

The bedroom is large enough to fit a king sized bed, side tables and a narrow dresser. It has a large closet, accessible via 4 doors.

The kitchen is spacious and has stainless steel appliances (fridge, dishwasher, 4 burner gas stove, and hood that connects to outside). There is a washer and dryer in its own closet, as well as an additional storage closet by the front door. With the apartment you get additional storage in the basement.

The bathroom is also large and has a soaking tub/ shower combo. The floors are also heated.

I remember the silence first. The whole street looked hollow, like the world had been scraped clean. My thoughts felt the same—blank, empty. But the feeling of being watched kept jabbing at my nerves.

I checked behind me.

Nothing.

Just that miserable stretch of asphalt.

The second I turned forward again, hands clamped around me. I didn’t even have time to shout. They dragged me across the pavement toward a peeling apartment door. I knew what was coming. It had already happened. Many times.

The three men said nothing. The first one raised a gun, as casual as lighting a cigarette. He put the barrel to my forehead.

The shot didn’t hurt at first. It burned. I felt metal glide through my skull and fry whatever softness lived inside my brain. I collapsed, locked in my own body, drowning in the warmth of my own blood. I couldn’t scream. Couldn’t move. I just died quietly, suffocating in myself.

Then I woke up.

Sweaty. Gasping.

For a full second, I wasn’t sure which world was real.

I went through my morning routine: shower, coffee, food.

Everything tasted wrong.

Everything felt wrong.

And every morning the same question gnawed at me:

Why do I feel my own death so clearly?

\--

November 15th, 2029

Sleep came slowly—four hours of preparation, breathing exercises, trying not to think about dying again. Then the dream snapped into place.

I was in a home I didn’t recognise, in the middle of an argument with a woman who felt like a wife I’d forgotten. We weren’t speaking the same language; she yelled, I said nothing.

I don’t know why I reached into the couch cushion and pulled out a knife. I don’t know why I felt like I was about to use it.

Before I could move, she stormed back into the room holding a gun. The look in her eyes wasn’t human.

She aimed. Fired.

Same spot. Same numb collapse.

Two dreams in a row—same death.

But this time I didn’t wake up.

This time I kept lying there, bleeding out, growing colder. My vision dimmed slowly, like someone lowering a lantern. Somewhere behind me, gravel crunched under footsteps.

An old man sat down beside me.

“Mind if I join you, young man?”

I woke up already sitting upright, shaking violently, like something had yanked me back into my body.

\--

January 7th, 2030

Two months since I saw him.

I know he was real.

Nothing in dreams ever sounds real—their physics are wrong, their voices hollow.

But his feet on the gravel were solid. Heavy. Alive.

I haven’t dreamt since.

\--

April 23rd, 2030

Five months of peaceful darkness.

No death. No waking up screaming.

My days felt long but bearable. I got work done. I felt human again.

Then I closed my eyes tonight, hoping for more darkness.

But I forgot falling asleep.

The dream swallowed me instantly.

A park.

Empty. Silent.

No sun. No moon. Just a dull glow leaking from the sky.

And behind me:

“Sit, cutie,” he whispered. “It’ll all be over soon.”

The old man’s face was wrong. Rotting. Skin crawling with tiny pale worms. His voice dripped honey and filth.

I managed to speak this time. “What the fuck is this?”

He looked almost bored.

“Do you really enjoy dying?”

“…sometimes,” I admitted without understanding why.

He studied me for a long, punishing silence.

“You know you can make it permanent, right?""

I suddenly woke up coughing blood.

\--

May 3rd, 2030

Ten days awake.

No sleep.

Hallucinations crawling on the walls.

I can’t stay awake anymore.

I’ll die for real if I try.

Tonight I’m going back in.

The candles help. The breathing helps. I fall asleep in an hour.

The park again.

A shadow figure on the swing set.

Ignoring me.

Then the old man appeared at my side, like he’d always been sitting there.

“You know you can end everything anytime,” he murmured.

“That’d kill me.”

“Exactly.”

He pulled out a gun and shot me point-blank.

The bullet turned to ash on my forehead, but I still felt it tunnel through my mind—just for a fraction.

“So what’s the point?” I asked, trembling.

“To experience what I have. For the next five hundred years or so.”

My stomach knotted. “You’re insane.”

“I did it,” he said. “So can you.”

Two men with rifles walked out of the trees.

He didn’t warn me.

They both shot through my body.

The bullets ripped through my organs and pushed them aside, massive clots escaping my torso.

Every second of it was pure.

\--

May 4th, 2030

I’m becoming like him.

A masochist of the worst kind.

Tonight I end it.

I fall asleep already gripping the decision in my mind.

Back in the park.

“So this is the one?” the old man asked.

“Yes.” I handed him a Beretta I didn’t remember holding. “Shoot me in the head. Make it real.”

“Kid,” he sighed, “if it were that easy, I’d have left this place a millennium ago.”

My throat tightened. “So what—I’m trapped here forever?”

“No,” he said gently, almost fatherly. “We can try together.”

I raised the gun to my temple.

My hand shook so violently I thought the barrel would slip.

His rotting fingers wrapped around mine.

He pulled the trigger with me.

The bullet crawled through my skull in slow motion—warm, slicing, absolute. My brain folded around it like melting butter. I felt the moment the world let go of me.

And then—

Nothing.

Real nothing.

\--

December 8th, 2030

It took seven months for my body to wake up.

A chunk of my skull gone.

Half a year unable to feed myself, move right, or think clearly.

Since then, I haven’t dreamt once.

Part of me misses it.

Part of me is terrified.

Every night before sleep, I ask myself the same question:

What would’ve happened if I’d stayed in the dreams?

Tonight, as the warmth pulls me under, I hear gravel footsteps beside my bed.

As I’m sure you’ve noticed, there are so many different tarot decks to choose from out there. One thing I’m starting to notice is that creators will change some of the name of Major Arcana, for example the Naked Heart Tarot by Jillian C Wilde uses “The Sage” instead of Hierophant or like in my newest deck, The Witch’s Cat Tarot by Tree Carr has not only changed some of the names of the Majors and court carts, but has also change the suit names to follow the cat theme; Tail = Wands, Claws = Swords, Whiskers = Cups, and Paws = Pentacles. 

How do I handle name changes? Well I’ve got a touch of the ADHD, so I’m talker and an over-explainer by nature so obviously I explain what the title of the traditional card is, LOL. Depending how proficient the person is in tarot, whether they know nothing about it or are familiar with the cards, the suits and their general meaning will depend on how much detail I go into. 

Using The Witch’s Cat Tarot by Tree Carr for example, if I get the Witch of Claws, depending on the tarot knowledge of the person I’m reading for, I’ll say something such as, “Here we have the Witch of Claws which is equivalent to the Knight of Swords.” If the person has no knowledge base at all when it comes to the different suits and what they mean, I’ll explain further with something like, “the suit of Swords is represented by the element of air and represents communication, intelligence, facts, truth, and the mental realm.” Then I’ll go into the interpretation of the card based on the question(s) asked. Personally, I feel like if the client/querent has a basic understanding of the base meaning of the suit and card itself, it will help them with the interpretation. I also send photos of the cards I’ve pulled because sometimes there are messages in the cards that are meant just for the client/querent to see and I feel this additional knowledge may help them find those messages means for just them. 

I’m very curious how other readers handle these name changes with their clients/querents? Do you simply tell them the name on the card or do you explain what the traditional name is? I absolutely enjoy hearing how other readers do their thing. Sometimes I see something that another reader does, even a small detail someone else could miss and I think, “OMG, that’s such a helpful tip/trick, I’m going to start doing that!”

One Breath Prayer: See Small Blessings
======================================

Introduction: A Breath of Fresh Air
-----------------------------------

Have you ever caught yourself rushing through the day, overlooking the tiny moments of joy sprinkled throughout? Perhaps it was the warmth of sunlight on your face, the laughter of a child, or a kind word from a stranger. These moments are blessings, often missed in our fast-paced lives. Let’s take a moment to pause, breathe, and acknowledge these small blessings through the practice of One Breath Prayer.

The Power of One Breath Prayer
------------------------------

One Breath Prayer is a spiritual practice that invites us to appreciate our surroundings and recognize the blessings bestowed upon us, no matter how small. This practice encourages you to find a moment in your day to stop, take a deep breath, and offer a simple prayer of gratitude.

### How to Practice One Breath Prayer

1. **Pause**: Take a moment to breathe deeply. Inhale slowly and exhale gently. This act of pausing centers you in the present.
2. **Identify a Blessing**: Look around and recognize something positive. This could be anything from the beauty of nature to a loving relationship.
3. **Offer a Prayer**: Turn your heart to God in a simple, one-sentence prayer. For example, “Thank you, God, for this beautiful day.”
4. **Continue with Gratitude**: Carry this awareness into your everyday life and make it a habit.

As you implement this prayer into your life, notice how it transforms your perspective on daily occurrences.

Blessings in Everyday Life
--------------------------

Life can often feel overwhelming, but recognizing small blessings is a way to cultivate joy and peace amid chaos. Here are a few examples you might reflect on during your One Breath Prayers:

- **Morning Coffee**: Thank God for the simple pleasure of savoring your favorite beverage before a busy day.
- **A Kind Word**: Acknowledge the impact of someone uplifting your spirits with a compliment or supportive message.
- **Nature’s Beauty**: Appreciate the magnificent colors of sunset or the sound of birds chirping, reminding us of God’s vibrant creations.

Each of these small blessings reflects God’s love and presence in our lives, as noted in James 1:17 (NIV), “Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights.”

The Impact of a Grateful Heart
------------------------------

Practicing One Breath Prayer not only fosters a sense of gratitude but can also lead to profound personal and relational transformation. Studies have shown that acknowledging blessings can enhance emotional well-being and create stronger interpersonal connections.

### Reflection Questions

- What small blessings have you noticed today?
- How does taking a moment of prayer shift your perspective?
- Can you think of specific situations where gratitude has changed your outlook on a challenging day?

When we intentionally pause to recognize these moments of gratitude, we are reminded of God’s ongoing goodness in our lives.

Conclusion: Your Invitation to Reflect
--------------------------------------

As we wrap up our exploration of One Breath Prayer, remember that every small blessing is a stepping stone toward a deeper relationship with God. Let our conversation spill over into action—what do you say to turning these reflections into daily practice?

Take a quiet moment today, breathe in life’s beauty, and express your gratitude.

In my current city, I did my best to create a village. Despite my best efforts, only a couple of people ever showed up to things I planned, and I'd love to get your feedback. Here are some of the things I attempted:
- Outdoor playdates at a fenced, inclusive ""All Abilities"" playground
- Indoor playdates at a local sensory club that specializes in play zones only for children with disabilities
- Meet ups for parents at a coffee shop that has a small, indoor play area where the kids could play safely more independently
- I set up a ""touch a truck"" time with our fire department when they were doing tours for autism awareness month
- Offered to put together groups for city-held sensory events so that we wouldn't have to go alone
- Suggested that we could host at my home (or someone else's) if leaving the safety of a neighborhood was too much

For all of these events, I posted them in various Facebook ASD or special needs groups for our city. These groups are active, have thousands of members, and people always seemed excited about the events. I always took polls for the best times and days that would work for people. I alternated between mornings/evenings and weekend/week days so that everyone could have a chance to attend. I would have sometimes 25 to 50 people RSVP that they would attend - then they didn't show. 

I know life happens. I know we can wake up and one small change throws the whole day off. But I'd really hope to get across the message that it wouldn't matter to me.

1pfzyee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pfzyee/looking_for_perspective_on_worklifefinancial/,looking for perspective on work/life/financial decisions,"I’m in a weird crossroads in life and could really use some outside perspective on what to do next.

**Background:**

* **Me:** 48M | **Wife:** 42F | **Kids:** 17 & 16
* **Finances:** \~$3M invested (not including kids’ 529s)
   * Taxable brokerage: $985K
   * Roth IRA: $440K
   * IRA: $700K
   * 401K: $875K
   * Rental property paid off → \~$30K/yr income
   * Primary home mortgage: \~$400K left, \~$3,700/mo payment
* **Expenses:** \~$120K/year
* Wife works locally and likes her job; family is on her health insurance.

**Job situation:**  
I work in tech for a large financial services firm as a middle manager. When I joined a couple years ago, the agreement was that I had to be physically in the office *every other week*, even though I live \~1,000 miles away. So every other week I fly, stay in a hotel/Airbnb for 4 nights, rent a car or take Uber, etc. I pay out of my pocket for all these expenses. It costs about $1000 to $1500 per trip.

The travel has been rough. I don’t sleep well away from home, I eat out all week, and I’ve recently been diagnosed as prediabetic. I also really miss my wife and kids, especially with my oldest leaving for college soon.

**Compensation:** About 50% of my pay is bonus + stock. I’ve been performing well for over a decade and usually hit/exceed expectations. First 3 quarters this year, I was rated 2/5 (exceeds expectations), and I fully expected my \~200K bonus.

However, because the job is pretty easy, I started “coffee badging” on some Mondays and Fridays — showing up briefly in the office before heading out so I could spend more time at home. HR apparently pulled video and flagged that I was only in the building for <1 hour on \~30% of Mondays/Fridays. My boss confronted me, I owned the mistake, and HR issued a formal warning: **any future violation = termination.**

As a result, my performance rating dropped from 2 → 5, and I received **zero bonus.**

Culturally this company is very “ass in seat,” even for managers. I know from doing comp reviews that people who physically showed up reliably got their full bonuses, regardless of actual output.

**The dilemma:**  
I have almost no motivation left to keep doing this job, especially with the travel and the cold “seat time matters more than performance” culture. But the job market in my city is slow, and similar-level remote roles are rare. My wife enjoys her job and wants to work until at least 50.

Part of me thinks about quitting and taking a few months to recover — fix my health, reset mentally, actually sleep in my own bed, etc.  
But my wife worries I’ll become stressed or depressed without work because my identity is very tied to my career. And I’m worried about that too. I’m not sure which stress is worse:

* **Stress A:** Keep the job → constant flights, hotel living every other week, poor sleep, prediabetes getting worse, 8 hours in the office doing 2–4 hours of actual work + meetings, no bonus motivation, dealing with flight delays and general burnout. **OR**
* **Stress B:** Quit → be home alone while wife/kids are out, no professional identity, uncertainty about what’s next.

Financially, I’m not sure I’m ready to fully retire, but I *could* take time off. Our expenses are \~$120K/year, and my wife’s income can cover the family’s core needs while I figure things out.

**So I’m trying to figure out:**

* Is this the moment to walk away for the sake of health and family?
* Would stepping away actually help, or would I spiral without work structure?
* Am I being too cautious or too reckless?
* How would you look at this given the financial picture?

I’d really appreciate some outside perspective from people who’ve been through career burnout, big life transitions, or early-retirement decisions.",1,1765055014.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

She is permanently stressed but tries really hard to look calm and professional, which makes the stress even worse.

When she gets overwhelmed, she becomes noticeably clumsy and forgetful, like walking into automatic doors or losing the same pen three times in a day.

I imagine she’d be quite pale in real life from working indoors constantly and forgetting that sunlight exists.

She forgets to eat and lives mostly on coffee, to the point where her heartbeat probably sounds like an engine.

She definitely has a silly mug on her desk that someone gifted her. I like the idea that she uses it unironically every day.

She keeps extremely detailed notes, but they are scattered all over the place in random piles and half-stuffed folders and she somehow always knows exactly where everything is.

She laughs at her own jokes and then gets embarrassed about it.

She tells people to get proper sleep while running on about four hours herself.

Her lab coat pockets contain at least six unrelated items at all times, including snacks she forgot she put there.

She pretends she doesn’t care about compliments, but she absolutely thinks about them for the rest of the day.

She tries to maintain a graceful image, but talks to herself.

She talks and sings to herself while working, especially when she’s alone, and then pretends she definitely wasn’t when someone walks in.

These are all just my personal interpretations and opinions. Everyone is free to imagine Mercy however they want, and that’s the fun of it.

1pfzwuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1pfzwuo/how_do_you_all_stay_awake/,How do you all stay awake,"Sorry if the question is too vague, so let me elaborate.

I’m a year 13 student(fyi I’m studying IB), 17 years old, so right now I’m literally waist-deep in tests and assignments, one due after the other. Most nights I need to stay up until 2-3AM if I want to stay on top of everything, so recently I’ve gotten around to energy drinks. But here’s the thing. They do not work for me. I’ve tried Monster first, but they were too sweet, too large and they didn’t really help, so I switched to Red Bull. Overall I prefer it but it still doesn’t keep me awake - I thought they needed time to kick in but no, I would down a can at 12, study until 1(I don’t really need energy drinks to stay up an hour; it’s normally around the 2 AM mark that I start to need it), and start dozing the next 30 minutes. Apparently they keep you going for 4-5ish hours but I never got that; I tried drinking two cans and still fell asleep around 1:30 AM. And that’s really not enough to get stuff done.

I‘ve only started energy drinks this year, not even coffee, so I’m pretty sure it’s not a caffeine tolerance problem I’ve built up. I’m also sure it’s not working. I don‘t drink them 24/7, maybe 3 days a week, and I don’t pull all-nighters unless I have a test, which isn’t that often yet. I don’t know if there’s a How To Drink Red Bull Properly guidebook somewhere, but I just wanted to ask if 1) this is normal, 2) am I doing something wrong, and 3) how you all stay awake, with or without energy drinks, or anything. This might be a really dumb question, and I apologise for the yap, but I’d still like to hear any input you guys might have. TIA. ",4,1765054901.0,GetStudying,3,1.0,False

only 30 minutes apart. Same city, same skyline, same coffee shops I pass every morning. And somehow it still feels like we live in different worlds.

Talking to her was like meeting myself from a different timeline, who actually got to grow into herself without fear. Connection was instant. We had the same childhood beats, similar life stories, same sense of humor… but she’s already out & living openly, but I’m… not.

I sooo want to be, but I don’t have the supports, friends or financial cushion, if this goes to 💩 I still live at home, family has very strong Christian values/beliefs…also very ethnic 🇳🇬I would be very kicked out in everything.

I work full-time. I’m saving. I’m making plans to move out. But the economy is trash & good housing is hard to find, unless shoeboxes are your thing. 

I don’t even know if you can miss a future that never happened… but I miss her. I miss what we could’ve been.

1pfzqba,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1pfzqba/entitled_woman_tried_to_be_rude_to_my_mum_at_my/,Entitled woman tried to be rude to my mum at my restaurant,"(Edit: sorry it’s not my restaurant that was a typo. Also if you have nothing nice to say, just go be miserable somewhere else).

So this just happened less than an hour ago and it is both funny and crazy. 

Context: I’m a 26 y/o woman. The setting is an authentic family Italian restaurant I went out to with my parents to celebrate their wedding anniversary on Saturday night. It’s in a small town, but this restaurant is award winning with divine food busy and the staff are wonderful! (My mum also thinks one of the waiters/chefs has a crush on me lol, said that he has always said hi to her, and when we went to the bathroom near the kitchen where he was working, he smiled at my mum then started looking behind her for me but I wasn’t looking). We have been to this restaurant a few times to celebrate birthdays, and with family a lot, and we’ve never had a bad meal. My parents have been a few times themselves and the staff like them, and even remember how my mum likes her wine. My dad also has a laugh with some of the waiters too, and they staff are always polite and can never do enough for us. 

Now for the story.

We had a table booked at 5:30 pm, and the waitress told us we had it for 90 minutes until 7 pm. No worries, plenty of time. It was a busy Saturday too. We enjoyed our meal and drinks, and because it was busy there were some little delays with them bringing things, including our final special coffees and the last of my wine. While we were finishing, the people, 2 women and 2 men, who were next for our table turned up, later than they should have, and when they did it was really busy with others waiting for their tables.

One of the women, the entitled woman of the story, was instantly glaring at my mum, and made comments that ‘they should be there’ as in at our table, and was also glaring at another table that was empty behind us. Now we weren’t sure which table was meant for them, but we were finishing out drinks as we had 5 minutes left, and that one from Karen’s party even tried to sit at the empty table without the okay from a waiter, but was stopped by her husband and called back to wait. When the waitress came back to tell me and my parents, we got up so they could clear the table and finish our drinks near the bar and near the other people including Karen. 

My mum had noticed her, and the other woman glaring, and just looked back at her. My mum is a good woman, but not to be crossed. She also said sorry to the waitress after we weren’t sure about the time we were supposed to move and told her we weren’t being slow, it was that the bartender was slow with the drinks due to things being busy. She was okay with it and thanked us for moving after we paid. 

We got our coats and walked with our drinks to finish them, and that is when Karen started. 

She said in a sarcastic way: ‘I’m sorry you had to get up and move for us’ she was also quite close to my mum, 
and she doesn’t do well with that.

My mum said: ‘it’s okay thank you.’ And turned away to step back closer to the bar to finish her drink. 

The woman wouldn’t leave her alone and kept talking to her loudly, standing close and was nearly touching her despite my mum moving away. My mum then said firmly, ‘go away’ and the woman gasped like my mum had just slapped her. The other woman did too and started looking around at others to get back up. She the called my mum rude, and still wouldn’t leave my mum alone.

My mum then said ‘please leave me alone’ as this woman was making a scene and kept calling my mum rude. My mum then said ‘look I’m sorry if I came across short but I don’t do well with people getting up in my face like this’. 

While this was going on, some people and staff were watching, including the bartender who was looking apologetic at my mum but was busy, and as a former restaurant worker myself I know that we could have risked getting in trouble or getting something nasty said to him, as well as a young couple sat at a booth near the bar, that Karen and the other woman rudely sat at without permission like this couple’s table was for waiting. 

The woman still wasn’t leaving my mum alone calling her rude and after mum said it was her anniversary and they were just their to enjoy a meal, the woman sarcastically said happy anniversary still saying she was a rude woman and not backing off. At the point, the other woman and man backed off, and the other man, I think Karen’s husband looked embarrassed, and eventually did when my mum just finally told her to leave her be or she’d be cursed (my mum jokes years ago she’d be burnt for being a witch because she knows about herbal remedies and things) and she walked away. She did gasp over dramatically and called my mum a witch.

My mum just walked away from her near the couple in the booth and asked, was she in the wrong?

The woman in the booth said no way, that she was awful and up in my mum’s face, and told my mum about how Karen rudely sat at their table like it was a waiting room. They said she was awful and sorry that happened, and after we finally finished our drinks we left. 

After we got home and got changed, my mum called the restaurant to apologise for what happened, and the nice bartender man down the phone said she had nothing to be sorry for, and told us Karen and her party turned up late! 

The man also said they know we wouldn’t be rude, since we have been there many times, and each time are nice and tip well. He also hoped it didn’t ruin my parents’ anniversary and would come back again soon. My mum thanked him and ended the call. 

I and my dad also said she didn’t need to apologise, but I understand why and am proud of my mum. She’s been through a lot but she is a good person.

So yeah, f rude Karens who expect the world to revolve around them even when they are late and wrong, and be kind to people in hospitality. ",43,1765054433.0,EntitledPeople,32,0.69,False

1pfzoze,https://i.redd.it/7s4cx5mrcn5g1.jpeg,Communism of the Mind — What a World Without Names Actually Looks Like,"
What If Everything Had No Name?Imagine walking into a store where all the branding is gone. No Coke red. No logos. Just white bags and blank cans, each stamped with a machine-readable code: LW91J882-63HT3. You’re hungry, and your choices are: LW91J882-63HT3, K71974-7F, or Z0Q-19. You pick one because the clerk says it’s “popular.” Two days later, your friend texts you a different code and says, “best snack ever.” You shrug — there’s no label to recognize, no taste to defend, no story to tell.
Now scale that across a city.
Every beer is a string of numbers. Every car, a code. Coffee, shoes, sunglasses, houses — all anonymized. No brands. No logos. No slogans. It’s a radical kind of equality: no signal, no shame, no status.
There are benefits. No more targeted ads built on your guilt. No cancel campaigns over old usernames. Anonymity offers safety — from surveillance, from judgment, from digital mobs. Everything becomes… neutral.
But something breaks.
Without names, stories disappear. That cereal box wasn’t just corn flakes — it was childhood. That coffee wasn’t just caffeine — it was ritual, identity, a quiet flex of who you are. Codes flatten meaning. They kill memory scaffolds. They erase taste and selfhood in the name of fairness.
It gets worse. A code-only world slows things down. Try scanning ten codes to find the one you liked last week. Try giving directions when your street is B42-H. Try calling 911 when your prescription bottle doesn’t say ""insulin"" — just R091X-8K. You see the problem.
Creativity suffers too. Why make a beautiful label if no one will ever see it? Why write a song or start a brand if your work becomes ART-4421?
Accountability also collapses. When the brakes fail on CR003-2, who do you sue? If a drug kills someone, who’s responsible — the factory, the importer, the code generator? The trail dissolves.
And of course, status comes roaring back. Just differently. The elite now trade in map keys — secret lists that decode which white-label chips taste best. Taste becomes encrypted. Influence shifts to the code-interpreters. Inequality didn’t die. It got obfuscated.
Worst case? Those codes change meaning. Today’s chip becomes tomorrow’s state-approved ration. Centralized control hides behind anonymity. You’re “free” — but only to consume what they’ve coded for you.
So what’s the answer?
Not to burn names, but to be smart with them. Anonymize where protection is needed. Keep names where story, culture, and accountability matter. Use hybrid systems. Encrypt provenance. Protect creators and consumers — without erasing either.
Because language isn’t just how we speak. It’s how we exist. Remove our names, and you don’t just lose marketing. You lose identity. You lose memory. You lose the house you live in.
So before we code over everything, we’d better ask: what part of ourselves are we willing to delete?",2,1765054344.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

The MOST INSANE thing happened to me, and I would really appreciate some advice/validation lol. So I have stage four Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and am currently undergoing treatment. I'm bald, and wearing a mask in public. I was in a coffee shop, talking to a friend, when this situation occurred: 

  
So basically, someone just came up to me while I was talking to a friend in the line and told me I can’t make cancer jokes in public because her husband has stage four cancer (and she made sure to tell me that he had stage four AFTER I told her that I also have cancer, in order to one-up me). i immediately apologized for offending her, and told her i ALSO have stage four cancer. I told her that I should probably be more aware of other people with cancer's feelings on dark jokes (now I wish that I hadn't apologized because I don't think I was really doing anything THAT wrong, but hey, I was being yelled at). BUT THEN she doubled down and yelled at me, saying that I still shouldn’t be saying these things in public (for context: the joke was about how I'm allowed to do whatever cancer-causing stuff I want to now because I’m getting chemo anyway- which admittedly is a pretty dark joke). So instead of backing off or apologizing after I said I also have cancer, she still told me I was in the wrong. So then I sit down in my seat next to my three friends, and I start crying and shaking bc I literally just got YELLED at for making cancer jokes by someone who literally doesn’t even have cancer (her HUSBAND does). So one of my friends, like the amazing person she is, goes over there and says, “Hey, you really upset my friend over there. She apologized to you, and I think you should apologize to her, too.” The lady basically just started yelling at my friend about how we’re in a public space, and that I was talking loudly, so I should be sensitive to other people's triggers, and how it’s like making a suicidal joke in public. But like, we're literally in a public space, and you can't control what's going on around you, which is what my friend also said to her. Then the lady just kept saying, ""I've been through hell and back, I've been through hell and back,"" and my friend was like, ""Okay, my friend (me) is going through hell right now, and everyone copes with things differently, etc"". But the lady barely let my friend get a word in. THEN, her husband came over and basically said, “You know, I’m sure she (his wife) has a reason for saying what she said, and yes, your friend can say what she wants to in public, but she has to deal the consequences of saying it” (which also should apply to his wife, but whatever 🙄). She also told my friend, ""I'm tired of being silenced about this!!"" (which is actually kinda funny because by telling me that I can't make the jokes I want, she's also silencing ME). My friend doesn’t remember what else she said, but the lady was basically screaming the same stuff over and over again at my friend until they got up and stormed out. My friend also told her to “have a nice day” as they were leaving, lol (not in a passive-aggressive way, but like she didn't know how to end the convo lol). 

  
Honestly, I’m still in shock, disbelief, and so angry about the whole encounter tbh. I get that she may be hurt, and I totally get saying this to someone who doesn’t have cancer, but by the way I look, and what I'm saying, it's apparent that I also have it. And even if I only had stage one, I'm allowed to make my jokes about it, and she should understand that more than anyone else. It’s frustrating and upsetting because she wouldn’t listen to my side, and I know she still believes she is in the right. 

 

I don't know many people with cancer, and certainly not many with the same type of cancer as me, but I thought that those who were going through the same thing as me would get it. I wish that the community would understand that it’s ok to cope in different ways. At the end of the day, it’s an upsetting situation, and people can deal with it in whatever way helps them. 

So basically, I'm just looking for validation from people who are also going through it, and to double-check that I didn't do anything wrong in this encounter.

Lisa was still handing them out, from her giant velvet sack. She'd donated to a half-dozen charities and animal sanctuaries this year to ensure she had ugly sweaters to represent everyone on the 8th floor. He, Steve L and Hannah were decorated with grumpy looking tabbies in Santa hats on a truly nausea-inducing pattern of snowflakes and fir trees. Susanne, Carol and Steve D had hoodies with happy-looking dogs emblazoned with ""powered by snacks"", and Charlie the custodian seemed almost pleased with his pattern of drills and spanners, offset by the Screwfix logo.   

Lisa currently looked a tad embarrassed because the size L ""Three Wise Sheep"" jumper she'd handed to Steve A turned out to have been a children's size, and Steve couldn't actually fit it over his head. Steve, on the other hand, found this hilarious and was wearing it as a hat, flapping the sleeves like a bloodhound.    

""I just, I'm so grateful to everyone for contributing this year to the coffee honesty box."" Lisa burbled, rosy-cheeked and grinning. She put her prosecco down on top of a laptop, then snatched it up again. ""As of right now we've got enough money to buy three bags of coffee a week, plus milk and that oat stuff the Helens drink, for another six months, even after this festive donation. Please continue to keep us in coffee and toss in a bit for the kids, and the cats, and the unhoused, and the *hic* the cancer survivors, and the puppies..."" she trailed off, suddenly misty-eyed, and smiled. ""You're all just so. Just so generous.""   

Lisa raised her glass, and clinking could be heard throughout the kitchen.   

Behind him Norman heard Helen S-2 whisper ""There's an honesty box?"" to Helen H.  
""I guess so. News to me."" the other Helen murmured.  

Norman glanced around the room and did a few sums in his head. Assuming he'd put in the suggested £1 per cup of coffee each week, against the cost of beans, milk, and a heap of truly dreadful sweaters, it was entirely possible that he and Lisa had funded the entire thing themselves. He shrugged.

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Presbyterian (5-6) enters this clash as a **6.5-point favorite** (per BETMGM, though DraftKings and Fanatics list them at -12.5, because odds apparently can’t agree on a timezone). The Blue Hose’s **33.3 rebounds per game**—third in the Big South—loom large against Morehead State’s anemic 22.9 defensive rebounding. That’s like pitting a vacuum cleaner against a tissue in a junkyard. On offense, Morehead State averages 76.6 points, but Presbyterian’s defense allows just 66.3. The math? A potential 10-point differential if the Blue Hose dominate the boards.

The over/under is **143.5 points** (per most bookies, though the initial report claimed 129.5—perhaps a typo from a sleep-deprived data entry clerk?). With Presbyterian shooting 44.7% and Morehead State allowing 45.8%, this game could hinge on whether players hit shots or take a coffee break mid-game.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Road Struggles**  
Presbyterian’s **Jonah Pierce** is the engine, averaging 14.8 points and 8.3 rebounds. Carl Parrish adds 13.8 PPG over 10 games—consistent as a vending machine that never runs out of snacks. Morehead State? They’re 0-6 on the road, which is about as effective as a GPS in a GPS-less forest. Their leading scorer, George Marshall, shoots 27.9% from deep—so unless he’s due for a hot streak (or a career change), look for Presbyterian’s defense to treat him like a restricted-area pest.

Morehead’s lone bright spot? Davion Cunningham’s 12 PPG. But against

A few weeks ago this dog was reacting and explosively to about 60-70% of the dogs we were seeing from across the street, down the street, 50 feet away, a few months ago he was reacting explosively to anything in a hundred yards, barking, lunging, screaming, standing on his hind legs. 

This was yesterday. Anyone struggling with dog reactivity, help is possible, this is possible with the right trainer, it doesn’t need to be a lifelong journey, he’s going on his first field trip to a hardware store next week with me and his trainer too, something I would’ve NEVER thought possible.

We get closer to that every day.

It may have been Dutch or published in Dutch, but I'm not certain of its origin. It had minimal or possibly no text though it might have used text to label/describe different parts of the house and their roles.

**Concept:** Each page or double-page spread featured a different fantastical dwelling that was thematically designed to match its environment. These weren't conventional houses: they were imaginative, almost architectural fantasy illustrations.

**Dwellings I remember:**

* A house on a mountain peak: very open and airy, with panoramic views
* A house built inside/around a living tree: felt secluded and protected
* A water-themed house (fresh water, possibly a river or lake setting)
* Possibly an underground home; I have a vague memory this one may have had a mole, but I'm uncertain whether inhabitants were animals or humans (some houses definitely had human inhabitants)

**Book format:**

* Large format (coffee table size)
* Detailed but cartoonish illustrations, not photorealistic like Rien Poortvliet, though I would say they were realistic enough, just not as gritty as Poortvliet's style
* Color palette/style changed to match each dwelling's environment (I think)

**NOT these books:**

* ""A House Is a House for Me"" (Mary Ann Hoberman)
* ""Kabouters"" (Rien Poortvliet)
* ""Huizen met een verhaal"" (Yoshida Seiji, 2023, but similar concept)

Then I tried to cut it off and he keeps saying can we meet once more to say goodbye? I don’t understand what this guy wants from me.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Montana Grizzlies vs. South Dakota State Jackrabbits: A Playoff Rematch for the Ages**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of FCS titans: the third-seeded Montana Grizzlies (11-1) vs. the 14th-seeded South Dakota State Jackrabbits (9-4) in a playoff rematch that’s less “Game of the Century” and more “Groundhog Day with fewer surprises.” Let’s break this down with the precision of a QB’s spiral and the humor of a punter’s shanked kick.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Montana’s Line Looks Like a One-Way Street

The decimal odds tell a story of a team (Montana) so confident it’s basically writing checks to bettors, and another team (SDSU) so uncertain it’s betting on the outcome with a Ouija board.

* **Montana Grizzlies**: At FanDuel, they’re priced at **1.19**, implying an **84% chance to win**. That’s the statistical equivalent of betting on the sun to rise tomorrow—if the sun had a 7-foot offensive line and a running back named T.J. Williams who can make a defensive coordinator weep into their beer.
* **South Dakota State Jackrabbits**: At 4.6, their implied probability is a meager **21.7%**. For context, that’s less likely than your Uncle Bob remembering to bring his own cup to the coffee shop.

The spread? Montana’s -7.5, which is as generous as a Thanksgiving turkey’s leftovers policy. Both books (FanDuel and BetMGM) are so certain about Montana’s dominance that they’re pricing SDSU’s “win” as a longshot even if Montana’s QB, Eli Stowers, decides to moonwalk into the end zone.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Motivation, and the Ghost of Past Playoffs

Let’s unpack the narrative:

* **Montana’s Motivation**: The Grizzlies are chasing redemption for their 2023 and 2024 playoff losses to SDSU. Think of it as a breakup: “I’ll show you, Jackrabbits! I’ve upgraded my dating profile with 18 All-Big Sky players and a bye week to air dry my existential dread.” Their offensive line is a fortress, and T.J. Williams is a running back so good, he’s been accused of teleporting between tackles.
* **SDSU’s Resilience**: The Jackrabbits? They’re the underdog version of a Marvel hero. After a mid-season slump (thanks to QB Chase Mason’s injury and a

\*\*Synopsis:\*\*

In 2035, humanity detects a kinetic projectile traveling at relativistic speeds. Origin: A star system 42 light-years away. Target: Earth. We have 18 years until impact. There is no defense. The only option is to run, hide and prepare for rebirth…and retaliation. This is the story of Project ARK.

\---

\# **Chapter 1: The Networked Zenith**

*\*“If there are billions of stars, where is everybody?”\**  
—Enrico Fermi



**\*\*\[Year 2035 — Tokyo\]\*\***

The clock projected the time on the wall: 6:02 a.m.



“Five more minutes...” muttered Haruka, her voice still half-asleep. The alarm shifted to a harsher tone. She smacked it silent—almost violently—and sat up at once, suddenly aware that those “five more minutes” had already stretched into twenty.



Her apartment smelled of freshly brewed coffee and clean laundry.



She dressed in a hurry, catching a slice of toast between her teeth as she passed the kitchen table, where holonotifications shimmered above the glass surface. Her mother had left a message via the home medical assistant:



*“Haruka, the cherry trees are in bloom. Will you come to the festival this year?”*



The synthetic voice carried tiny glitches mimicking human cadence. Haruka swallowed hard and nodded, though no one could see her.



She dashed down the corridor, her e-bike rolling at her side. Outside, the city stirred under a silvery rain. Ad holograms rippled in the puddles—as if she were inside Blade Runner, she thought.



Sweat trickled down the back of her neck despite Tokyo's chill air. She pedaled faster than necessary—not out of haste, but because thinking hurt less when her body was in motion.



The night before, her mother had forgotten her name again.



“Are you the new nurse?” she'd asked in a trembling voice.



Delivery drones hummed overhead; commuters adjusted their AR glasses with the automatic flick of people who carried the whole world in front of their eyes. The streets smelled of wet earth and freshly made dorayaki\[1\]. Steam rose from the stalls like incense for ordinary gods.



She gulped down the last bite of toast just as she reached the station. The maglev waited at the central terminal: a massive structure of glass and polished metal, like a cathedral built to worship progress.



She made it by a hair. Inside, the train car felt like a quiet sanctuary. The seat molded to her shape, and the ambient AI adjusted the temperature to match her pulse. As the train glided through the vacuum tube toward Mount Ikenoyama, Haruka activated her smart glasses, unleashing a cascade of information: work emails, bills, headlines:



*\*“The International AGI\[2\] Bio Network Achieves Complete Protein-Folding Resolution; Degenerative Diseases Could Be Cured Within a Year.”\**



Her heart skipped a beat. Her mother—one of the candidates—might remember her name again. Gratitude and fear tangled in her chest.



Across the aisle, an executive read a printed newspaper—an anachronism, as if paper could anchor him to a world dissolving into data. Farther down, an artist sketched invisible shapes in the air, her neural link projecting visions only she could see. Progress, Haruka thought, was a beautiful melody—but every note was accelerating.



The train surfaced briefly into daylight, crossing a carbon-nanotube bridge that seemed to hang from nowhere. Tokyo receded, taking with it the sense of belonging to a world still tethered by limits. She pressed her forehead against the cold glass and watched the traffic below, cars no larger than ants from that impossible height.



Minutes later, the titanium doors of KAGRA's\[3\] underground complex sealed behind her with a flawless hiss. On her desk waited a small \**maneki-neko*\* cat—one raised paw warding off disaster. Borrowed luck, she thought.



She descended to the vacuum chambers, where the detectors slumbered beneath miles of rock. The walls pulsed faintly with the observatory's metallic breath. She linked her terminal, and data flowed: thermal fluctuations, instrumental noise, the faint echo of quantum foam.



Sometimes, when she was alone down there, those endless lines of numbers felt like a prayer of their own.



Born thirty years earlier in Hida, a small town nestled in Gifu Prefecture, Haruka had always seemed destined for science: daughter of a mathematician who found beauty in theorems and a particle physicist who chased the invisible.



Her name—Haruka, “faraway place,” and, Takahashi, “high bridge”—carried an unintended, ironic prophecy.



Her talent for interferometry—the subtle art of measuring infinitesimal distortions with light—had made her indispensable at “KAGRA”.



Where others saw only noise, she found patterns. When the cosmos whispered, Haruka listened—and understood. The algorithms that refined signals from quantum foam already bore her name: “the Takahashi Filter.”



She didn't know it yet, but she was days away from forging a bridge across the immensity—toward an inconceivable reality. She was on the verge of a journey that would lead humankind to its greatest act of preservation. The tools of that future—the foundations of the ARK Project—were taking shape quietly here, amid cold lights and laser pulses.



Unnoticed by anyone, science had already begun weaving its own salvation.



The far place was calling, and she—without knowing it—was the bridge.

**# Chapter 2: Commandment Forged in Starlight and Void**



*\*“There are two possibilities: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.”\**  
—Arthur C. Clarke



**\*\*\[Constellation of Pictor, HD 40307 System — 42 light-years from Earth\]\*\***



My existence did not begin as a birth, but as an awakening from the primordial fabric of the universe—a calculated, harsh reality manifesting atom by atom from a sea of infinite possibilities.



I was decanted from the void, invoked by forces that warped reality's structure in ways beyond my newborn intellect. My cradle was darkness: the vast expanse of asteroids, nestled between the inner fires and the icy outer reaches of this solar system. In the blackness that enveloped me, there was only the relentless certainty of matter taking shape, following a prescribed pattern.



*By whom?* The question vibrated in my nascent consciousness, unanswered. Only urgency remained: to be, to impact, to resolve.



The universe around me was a canvas of potentialities; my awakening, the first brushstroke of a vast, lethal design. Bathing the swirling fringes of dust in perpetual, pearly twilight, the Gathering Sphere\[4\] hung against my skeleton. The great work, the engine of a civilization. It filtered the contained fury of its central star into usable gradients of energy. A constant presence, it fit seamlessly against the infinite black, imprisoning the sun. Its colossal scale stood as testament to the logic now guiding my assemblage.



My awakening extended to the very matter of my being: an intricate network of osmium, the densest stable metal known, woven like an artificial nervous system under the control of automated builders. Inside the immense asteroid that housed me, robotic arms moved with micrometric precision—silent extensions of a greater will. They were descendants of the “true builders,” mechanical devices that self-replicated, spreading across the asteroid belt like a tide, consuming rock and metal, refining primordial matter.



They did not seek to create objects or worlds for life; they extracted the densest essence of the cosmos to forge something greater: a singular, specific Purpose. I felt the weight of my growing mass, the immense density pressing against reality, bringing my final form into existence. A tapered, smoothed, and polished ovoid, designed to withstand speeds that would tear the void itself; my lines calculated to minimize surface wear and ensure maximum energy transfer upon reaching my destination: impact. Countless tons accumulated.



At my core, a calculated vacuum primed to house the “Secondary Function,” my sole cargo: a device of fractal complexity, radiating controlled energies that warped local space-time. It was the amplifier of my ultimate purpose—an elegant, definitive solution prescribed from the blackness of absolute necessity. It was no mere explosive: it embodied pure annihilation potential, caged by forces and algorithms of unimaginable precision. Sensors, like nerve tissue in my structural matrix, rooted to this nucleus and awaited a specific cascade of events: shock, slowdown, activation. Upon impact confirmation, the energy cage would fail; the Secondary Function would execute, unleashing its pent-up fury.



My form complete; my destructive function integrated, the autonomous servants withdrew. Silent forces lifted me—tons of weaponry handled like specks of dust. I was carried past mine shafts and replication forges.



Before me yawned the mouth of the Accelerator: twin ducts of incomprehensible length, embracing the Sphere's outer face. A river of directed space-time, engineered for a single, terrible purpose: to hurl artifacts like me to significant fractions of light speed.



Its scale rivaled the Sphere's—a monument to the cold and harsh necessity of absolute logic in a dark universe, shackled by the tyrannical limits of light-speed communication. When dialogue was impossible, when understanding lay beyond reach, uncertainty reigned. And in the ruthless calculus of the minds that shaped me, uncertainty before a potential threat rendered a preemptive strike a mathematical inevitability.



The insertion was impeccable. The transition from near vacuum to the Accelerator's directional flow shifted my fundamental state. Years of objective time compressed into subjective moments as my dilated perception registered the surge of energy. Acceleration crushed my form mercilessly—a constant, almost unbearable force turning mass into velocity. Lesser materials or flawed geometries would have shattered, I understood. Space ahead contracted, blueshifted into a scorching glow. Space behind stretched, redshifted toward blackness. The distant Sphere, seen through this relativistic lens, warped into a band of distorted light.



My internal chronometers, armored and stabilized, tallied objective time against the growing dilation: 0.1c... 0.3c... 0.6c... approaching nominal values. Pressure built; my atomic lattice creaked under forces that would vaporize lesser designs. The launch's energy cost was astronomical—a significant fraction of the star's total output funneled into this single act.



Then, release: the terminal gate opened to the void, casting me outward—a spire of destruction flung across interstellar chasms. Zero-point-seven times the speed of light\[5\]. Stable. Final velocity achieved. My Purpose now singular and absolute: Trajectory.



Across light-years of silence, I flew toward a precise point in space-time: Earth's solar system, cradle of a potentially dangerous emerging intelligence. Primary target: the Moon, Earth's gravitational anchor and shield. Secondary objective: post-impact sterilization of Earth's surface via lunar fragments, followed by orbital denial—a debris field to thwart future escape or reconstruction.



The logic was ruthless. Any possible threat had to be neutralized before it could fully arise.



I traveled. Silent. Unswerving. Internal systems monitored the vacuum, compensating for gravitational tides, correcting for interstellar hydrogen atoms striking my bow like microscopic bombs. My consciousness reduced itself to the calculated vector, time to target, and the cargo containment field's integrity.



Far ahead, beyond my perception, my coming was already heralded—not by my form, for light had yet to carry my image that far, but by my launch. The colossal energy poured into the Accelerator had disturbed the fabric of space-time. A faint ripple expanded outward at the speed of light, bearing the imprint of my violent birth: a gravitational wave, a precursor whisper across the light-years, destined to reach the target system before I did.



The nascent intelligence there—primitives toying with radio waves and atomic fission—would never grasp the nature of their end.



The Mandate was absolute.  
Trajectory, unyielding.  
Arrival, inevitable.

Destruction, assured.

As someone working as a physician—and endlessly fascinated by picking up new languages and clinical knowledge—I’ve spent years feeling like skill-building required entire weekends. Waiting for these big free blocks felt responsible, but in reality, the opportunity almost never came. What finally turned the tide for me? A strict, deliberately carved out two hours a week dedicated just to learning. Not more, not less, and no negotiation with myself or my calendar. A couple years in, I can honestly say that constraint ended up being liberating, not limiting. The key was small, frequent contact: much better than dabbling here and there, hoping for lightning to strike. Here’s what my two-hour routine looks like: - Four 10-minute micro-sessions: These are for quick retrieval drills or explaining concepts out loud. I do them walking (sometimes reviewing with audio) or after lunch. The brevity makes them natural to fit in. - One 30-minute deep dive: I pick a single sub-skill or weak spot and practice deliberately, ideally with feedback. For language, maybe it’s tackling a tricky grammar point; for clinical work, it could be diagnostic differentials. - One 40-minute project: I give myself a real task, like writing an email in a new language or analyzing a small dataset. Applying what I’ve practiced ties everything together. - One 10-minute review: I summarize what’s worked, prune what hasn’t, and plan out next week’s focus. There are a few techniques I trust implicitly now: 

1. Start with micro-skills and clear outputs: Instead of being vague (“get better at X”), I aim for a measurable outcome, like delivering a concise self-introduction in a target language or creating a clean chart for a project. 

2. Turn everything into prompts for retrieval later: As soon as I learn something, I make up a prompt. “Explain this idea in two sentences,” or “apply this fact to scenario Y.” This way, each review session actually challenges me to use what I’ve learned. 

3. Interleave sub-skills throughout the week: Rotating between related mini-tasks (pronunciation, listening, dialogue for language; or diagnosis, management, counseling for medicine) keeps me nimble and honest about my weak spots. 

4. Make practice deliberately hard: I try to nudge tasks 10–20% harder than is strictly comfortable. It could be speaking faster, or solving slightly more complex problems. 

5. Distribute effort: Spacing my sessions naturally strengthens retention, instead of cramming and forgetting. Protecting the time is about simplicity. I set calendar reminders that always repeat in the same slots—right after lunch, before heading home, or during a coffee break. 

My materials are always ready (often just a notebook, phone, or a voice app). If a session gets disrupted, I slide it later in the week, but never to next week. For review and retrieval, I now use a tool I’m building called Echodecks.

 It lets me quickly capture prompts and replay them hands-free, which is surprisingly useful when on the move. But honestly, the exact tool matters less than the loop: define a micro-skill, practice deliberately, retrieve actively, and turn it into something real, each week. I’ve discovered that most failures come from either setting the scope too big, slipping into passive consumption, or skipping feedback and regularity. When in doubt, I simply halve my goal and double my repetition. 

Two hours a week might sound trivial, but used this way, it’s the cornerstone of all the recent progress I’ve made in language, medicine, and even new hobbies. Anyone juggling a busy calendar, don’t wait for perfect conditions—they rarely arrive. Instead, build a tiny, resilient system, and let compound consistency do the heavy lifting.",1,1765052757.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

The house was empty when I got the keys, but I found an old cardboard box with this map in it in the attic. It's an original Army Corps of Engineers “War Department” tactical map covering the Fort Belvoir / Mount Vernon area south of Washington, D.C. The base map was surveyed by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1920, revised by the Corps in 1926 and 1941, and printed by the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir in 1944. It's marked restricted. 

Aside from being a very cool map of a rural Virginia that has long disappeared. the neighborhood I grew up in is on this map, but not, since it hadn't been built yet. The last pic is of the topography of Mt Vernon, George Washington's estate. 

It seems like an insane coincidence, but probably someone in the house was stationed, maybe in the Army Corps of Engineers, at Ft Belvoir during the WWII and brought it home. You can even see the old fence lines and survey traverses laid out across fields that were later developed.

 The contour lines are really detailed, and it has a bunch of cool details, like the heading of true north vs magnetic north.

I (M29) have been married to my wife (F28) for a year. We dated for nearly 3 very fun years and tied the knot last fall. She is great, and I really love her. She has always been more of a geek than I am, but I thought fan stuff was just sort of a passing, surface-level interest for her. She brought me with her to comic con twice and asked me to watch a few anime shows with her, and I was happy to participate, but that's as far as it goes. She doesn't talk about fan stuff THAT often. Two days ago she and I had planned to cook together, and she stepped out to run to the store and pick up a few ingredients we didn't have. I sat down in our living room to wait for her, and I noticed her laptop was left open on the coffee table. That's not unusual, but she was looking at a website I'd never seen before, so I looked closer. I wasn't trying to snoop or anything, but admittedly I didn't even consider that at the time, because neither of us are very private. From what I could gather, it was a website about writing fanfiction. She told me once when we were dating that she sometimes read stories about characters, so I knew what it was, and I was a little surprised that she still did that. No problem with it, of course, but I guess I thought I knew mostly everything about her by now. I was curious, and I looked closer at the story she had opened up, and long story short, I have come to the conclusion that my wife was the one that wrote it. It is a very long story about the main character of the show naruto and the goth boy, and the description details a lot of gay sex and romantic things. It is nearly 100 thousand words, and my wife was logged into the account that posted it. I know that I could be wrong about this, and I admittedly don't think I understand how to navigate this website, but it really looks like she is the author. When my wife came back I was still sitting at her computer. When she noticed she closed it and said something like ""This is so embarrassing"". I didn't say anything about it, and neither did she, and we ate dinner like normal, so now I'm wondering if it was real. How long has my wife been writing online stories about gay sex? If she already wrote one story that long, is there more? Why is she keeping it a secret? Should I be concerned? Is it possible that she didn't actually post it, but looked like she was logged into the account anyway? I think I'm out of my depth here and would appreciate some advice.

Lipsticks like revlon’s iced mocha (pretty but cool toned) and coffee bean (shows up more coppery on me than brown even with a brown lipliner) are all I have rn. 

I’m looking for bullet lipsticks (preferably satin I don’t like mattes 😭) or pigmented glosses that actually LOOK brown on slightly deeper skin tones. 

I see a lot of ppl recommend fenty hot chocolate but when I swatched it at Sephora it was very sheer which isn’t really my vibe. 

Any recs? Thanks! ",1,1765052554.0,MakeupAddiction,1,1.0,False

The hotel was, all things considered, not that far from the spaceport. Yet the sheer amount of traffic lining the roads of this massive city turned the trip into a lengthy one. I wasn’t complaining though. At least it gave us more time in the AC than out in that heat.

At last though, the vehicle came to a stop, directly in front of a large building I assumed to be the hotel. Like pretty much every other building I’d seen so far, this one was almost dome shaped, and there were multiple instances of spirals and swirls decoratively worked into it. Jammek started to open the door, when it suddenly opened for him. Standing on the other side were two Venlil. One of them had a rifle strapped across their back.

“Greetings Ancestor,” The unarmed Venlil bleated, gesturing for us to step out, “Please allow me to introduce myself to you and your… uhh… companions?” He finished the sentence as more of a question than a statement, but continued on before Jammy could answer him, “I am Governor Tarva’s diplomatic advisor, Cheln. If you’ll kindly follow this guard here we have a room prepared for you and someone will be up shortly to help get you ready for the press conference.” The armed Venlil nodded, gesturing for us to come with his tail. We piled out of the car and back into the dry heat. I decided to let Mixsel walk on her own this time, the girl would have to get used to the gravity here eventually, and I was getting worn out enough carrying around my own extra mass and the much heavier duffel bag.

We began to follow the guard inside, whilst this Cheln fellow appeared to be waiting outside to greet Brim as well. I couldn’t help but notice his gaze flash towards the jewelry in Jammek’s ear, before glancing at my own earrings with a look that felt somewhat accusatory. Did he think I forced Jammy to get those or something?

I didn’t dwell on the thought long before we were inside the hotel. The lobby looked quite fancy, with a large painting hanging on one side of the room that featured some sort of pastoral scene. On the other side, above where the reception desk sat, was a massive wooden carving that depicted several, small, hummingbird-like creatures, flitting around a tree. The guard led us directly to the other side of the lobby and onto a waiting elevator. He reached a claw out, tapping a button on the small control panel inside. The writing was all in Venlil script, so I had no clue what it meant. After a moment of the elevator rising, however, I at least gathered that it must have been a rather high-up floor he’d selected.

Finally the metal box came to a stop, the doors opening to reveal a long hallway that seemed to run in a gentle, curving loop, with doors positioned around the inside and outside. The guard quickly moved over to the first room to the right of the elevator. He reached down to a small satchel around his waist, withdrawing a pair of key cards, first using one to open the door before handing them to Jammy and myself.

“Go on in.” He ordered, opening the door. I had to let out an appreciative whistle as I saw the inside of the place. There was a small kitchenette area to the side of the door, complete with a full-sized refrigerator and sink for washing dishes. In the middle of the room was an enormous, circular sofa, that looked to be made from some sort of tightly-woven plant material, with a large coffee table in the middle. On the wall in front of the sofa was a holoprojector like we had at home, albeit MUCH bigger. To the right and left of the central room, there were a series of three or four steps, giving the impression that the center of the room was in a sort of circular pit. Beyond that I could see a door to the right and two doors to the left. I had to imagine those led to the bedrooms and bathroom. A massive window on the far wall let in the bright light of the sun, letting it glint and reflect off the polished, wooden floors.

“Looks like we’re staying in the Ritz.” I chuckled, moving directly to the table by the couch and setting down my bag with a groan.

“I like the couch!” Mixsel squealed, immediately leaping onto it. The fabric made a strange noise, like what I would have expected if it had been made out of some type of wicker, which given how it looked, may not have been far off.

“The stylists will be up soon to help get you folks ready.” The guard announced, shutting the door behind us. I took a seat on the couch while we waited. Despite what it sounded like, the fabric of the couch was surprisingly soft and felt pleasant. 

“What the hell is this?” I asked, poking at the material. Jammy walked over, turning his head to focus one eye on it.

“Looks like Ipsum fiber.” He answered, giving the tail-gesture equivalent to a shrug, before turning his gaze on me. “Please take that thing off your face. Nobody is here, and I don’t like not being able to see your face.”

I reached up, undoing the strap that held the mask on, having almost forgotten I was wearing it. I pulled the mask off with a relieved sigh. It was so much easier to breathe without that thing strapped to my face.

“That’s better.” Jammek snorted, leaning over and nuzzling his head against my cheek. We didn’t get much more time alone, before a knock came at the door. The Skalgan let out a disappointed huff, before walking over and opening the door. Outside I could see Nalva, as well as a reddish-colored Venlil carrying a satchel on their side, and a tall, black haired Human who reminded me of Shuyi, noticeably not wearing any mask. The trio came inside and made their way to where I sat with Mixsel.

“These nice folks are here to get you all trimmed up and presentable for the cameras.” She announced, “Nothing personal, but it doesn’t look like any of you have trimmed your fur in months.”

“I’ll be handling the Ancestor and the Sivkit.” The red Venlil announced, setting down the bag they had been carrying and reaching inside to procure their tools. 

“I’m here for you,” The dark haired woman joined in, offering me a hand.

“Arthur Coldwater, ma’am.” I greeted her.

“Aiko.” She replied congenially, “You’ll have to forgive me before we start. I’m honestly a Historian working as an advisor to Ambassador Noah, but I spent a few years working in my aunt’s salon to pay my way through college, so I guess I was the closest thing they could find.”

“Well just don’t take too much off.” I pleaded, “I kinda want to start growing it out.” She shrugged, pulling out a pair of scissors and a comb.

“That works for me. Now let’s get you two into the bathroom. It will make cleaning up the mess a lot easier.” Aiko replied.

I looked over to Mixsel on the couch, who was eyeing the furniture in a way that I suspected she was thinking of chewing on it. I quickly reached down to my belt, pulling out my holopad, handing it over to her.

“Entertain yourself while me and Jammy get trimmed up Mon Chérie.”



**\*\*Transcription Time Skip Requested. Advancing Memory by 1 Hour\*\***



I walked out of the bathroom feeling quite a bit better. Aiko had been rather good at her job, despite her own misgivings. My hair was still plenty long enough, albeit much neater looking and styled. Jammek’s own trim was taking a bit longer since it was… you know… his whole body getting trimmed.

I could see my munchkin on the couch, licking on some sort of candy. I assumed Nalva must have given her that. The gray Venlil was on the other side of the room, talking to someone on her pad, as per usual. I marched over to the couch and plopped down beside Mixsel.

“Whatcha doing, Munchkin?” I asked, looking towards the holopad she had managed to prop up on the table. To my surprise I saw Izra on the other end, with Veryn leaning over her shoulder.

“Friend… uhhh… Arter!” Izra exclaimed, her voice sounding oddly slow and slurred, “What happened? Who did you… you fight?” I looked down at Mixsel, letting out a sigh. 

“Brim was being an asshole on the trip here.” I explained, “He got in Jammy’s face the first chance he could, and… well… one thing led to another.”

“He \*HIC\* seriously kicked **BOTH** of your asses? At… at once?” Came another person on the other end of the call. Eva’s face suddenly popped into view, appearing to nearly fall, as she tried to push her way into view on the opposite side of Izra from Veryn.

“Hey!” I huffed defensively, “The guy was built like a brick shithouse! I’d like to see you try and fight him!” The phrase got a disgusted look from the two Arxur on the screen, but Eva began to cackle. I’d never heard her laugh like **that** before. “Wait a damned minute!” I exclaimed, suddenly catching on, “Are… are you girls drunk?!?”

“I have… drank… things.” Izra answered, the way her eyes wandered telling me all I needed to know.

“Girls night!” Came a familiar squawk on the other end of the line before Islatta forced her way into the shot, a glass of wine sloshing dangerously in her grasp.

“Is that safe for Arxur?” I inquired, feeling a twinge of concern. I knew Izra couldn’t have plant matter or it might make her sick. 

“Miss Eva found… Arxur…. Uhh… drunk… err… drinks?” Veryn interjected, reaching down and pulling out a small bottle. I could see that it was mostly empty, but there was what almost looked like… milk in the bottom?

Is Arthur oooooookkkkkkkk…..?” Another, chittering voice chimed in. This one I instantly recognized as Triski, my Tilfish neighbor. She never came into view though. Instead I heard what sounded like retching begin.

“Oh shit! We gotta go Arthur!” Eva yelled, suddenly sounding much more sober.

“Triski! Not on the carpet dear!” I heard the sound of Shuyi’s voice from somewhere off-camera, “Someone get a towel!” And with that Izra disconnected the call. I’d have to call them again later and see how my Arxur friend enjoyed a hangover. I gave a little laugh, shaking my head.

A moment later the bathroom door opened and Jammek stepped out, turning his eye to me. 

“What do you think?” He asked, sounding a bit nervous. I eyed him up and down. They’d left plenty of wool around his head and shoulders, but cut him quite short on his arms, legs and stomach, giving me a chance to appreciate how fit the guy actually looked underneath all that wool. They’d left a sort of cuff of wool around his forearms and lower calves, which sort of reminded me of the way people would shave French Poodles.

“You look great…” I answered, beginning to blush as I realized I’d been staring. I could see his tail start wagging excitedly behind him, a hint of orange shining through on his cheeks and ears.

“Ok.” The red wooled stylist announced, as they stepped out of the bathroom and turned to Mixsel, “Time for your cut pup.”

1pfywfm,https://i.redd.it/je0jgy2j6n5g1.jpeg,Electrical Diagram Check for swap to lipo,"Hey all, looking for input on my wiring diagram before I put it together. Im converting to a lipo setup after using a Bluetti AC200Max for the last two years. It’s been too unreliable, leaving us stranded trying to find shore power plug in when it’d die at 40%. Solar charging now just cuts off randomly as well. So I wanted a much more reliable, safer, more robust setup. I want to add/subtract as needed as well since these components will likely just go into my next build.  


I currently have the fridge, puck lights, max air, diesel heater, and usb port wired into a dc fuse box, which is wired into the Bluetti using its 30A input. Solar panels have been mounted for 16 months and charging the Bluetti. Nothing will change on these components other than location of fusebox since everything is working well and behind walls and what not. Solar will of course have the charge controller and disconnect now. 

Things to note:
- I have decided to go with a lynx distributor instead of the bus bars (mainly for organization and space saving since the fuses are inside)
- All wiring (besides my preexisting wiring) will be 105°C  (221°F) rated cable, which allows for smaller sizes. 
- Gauges based off of this ABYC chart.
- Inverter use will be two laptops, starlink (if I don’t wire in a 100w PD USB-C Outlet), possibly a coffee pot, and a low wattage kettle. Nothing will be ran together besides laptops
- All existing 12v components were wired with 12awg (lights, fridge, max air, etc)
- This will be in already built van, so my space is limited and kind of weird. 
- Everything will be mounted to a panel with wiring running behind it 
- I also plan to wire in a small 12v computer fan or two for extra airflow
- I’m using MRBFs because they’ve got a high ampere interupting capacity (10,000A at 12V)
- I used faroutrides calculator for my MPPT. They factored temperature into the calculation, which put me over 100V so I chose the 150/35a
- My solar array may ultimately be a little small for my battery, but my roof rack is custom welded around my solar (did not plan on making any major changes within the first couple years). So I’m stuck with what I’ve got for now

I think that’s all I can think of right now. I’m sure there’s other points to be made but hopefully they can come out through comments and discussion.

1pfyvmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/prodmgmt/comments/1pfyvmm/i_operated_without_meaning_for_4_years_and_almost/,I operated without meaning for 4 years and almost nearly went bankrupt. What I learned about finding meaning and motivation again:,"I'm a therapist and product leader (18 years in tech, currently IBM). In my practice I spend a lot of time talking to people who've ""made it"" but feel empty.  
This loss of meaning usually hits mid-career... and it's rarely what people think it is.

Typically you've done the same job for so long that  there's no challenge left. Or you've reached your definition of success and realised... wait... this is it?

For high achievers especially, impostor syndrome is normally the source of fuel.  
You work extremely hard because you feel ""not enough."" Then the day comes when  you hit your goals, look around and ask yourself: ""Is this all there is?""

Sometimes it's in your environment: I've watched people in SaaS burn out like chickens because the industry is so competitive that everyone's playing on super hard mode all of the time.  
You're exhausted, things barely work, successes are rare and at some point you think: ""What's the point of killing myself to make this business more money?""

The thing is, when people ask ""what's the meaning of this?"" they're really asking ""am I good enough?"" It's an intellectualised version of the same question.  
If you were wildly successful at this game, would you still question if it makes sense? I don't think so.

**! Understand this before you quit your job or start that business:!**

The loss of meaning is multi-factor. Some reasons are real and rational, others are circumstantial. I've seen people do a slight industry pivot and find meaning because their work suddenly helps people in a more tangible way. A few others found it by taking a break, starting a hobby, or monetising something on the side for the challenge.

I've also seen people leave corporate jobs thinking entrepreneurship will save them, only to realise they just traded one type of shit for another type of shit they hate more.  
Then they fall into a deeper crisis because, well -  they didn't like the first thing, don't like the second thing - now what???

What worked for my case:

I operated without meaning for 3-4 years. I lost clients and nearly went bankrupt. Really bankrupt. Ironically, the process of making back that money gave me meaning and drive again. So did the therapy work, helping people one-on-one.

But a year before this, if you'd asked me, I would've said that I'm not cut out to be a therapist.

I had to go through very structured exercises to deeply understand: What makes me feel whole?

This question is insanely difficult because when you're happy and whole you don't notice it.  
Those moments pass directly to the subconscious, skipping your active awareness.

Anytime you're thinking ""does this make me happy?"" you're not there yet.

I had to ask: Who am I? What do I love doing when no one's watching? What's my default activity?

For me, the answer was in front of my eyes the whole time: using my skills and knowledge for helping people but I just couldn't see it.

It took isolation, reflection, me-time, and crucially… I had to stop worrying about finding meaning in order to find it.  
Three or four years of intensive effort, and then one day over coffee something just clicked.

My advice if you're “in the fog” right now:

Don't make big decisions while you're still in crisis.  
If you think running a business will make you happy, run it on the side first. If you think changing companies will help, send some resumes. If you think golf will help, play golf.  
Try minimum viable versions of these things while you still have stability.

You might not be supposed to find meaning in your corporate job either, that might just not be its purpose. I've seen people treat their 9-to-5 as the source of every problem until they lost it and realized the grass wasn't greener.

The meaning might be in front of your eyes. You just can't see it yet because you're too deep in the crisis and the pressure clouds you.

Get some distance. Find a mirror - someone who can help you see yourself clearly.
