- Age: 34, young enough to hike, old enough to know my limits at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
- Height: 5'7"" – tall enough to reach the top shelf, short enough to ask for help with the really high stuff.
- Religion: Sikh – So yes, I believe in Waheguru and good vibes. Open to matches from all castes because love doesn’t need a filter (except maybe for coffee).

Hobbies:

- Cooking – My kitchen experiments have a 90% success rate (not counting the time I tried baking).

- Driving – Long drives + good playlists = perfect therapy.

- Hiking – Nature’s gym, minus the monthly membership fee.

- Sports – TT, Badminton, Football, Cricket… basically, if it involves running or smashing, I’m in.

- Volunteering – Helping others fills my heart. It’s also a great excuse to dodge Netflix guilt.

- Movies & Documentaries – From The Shawshank Redemption to The Last Dance, I’m ready to dive deep into the magic of storytelling.

- Stock Markets – By day, I’m a Technical Lead. By night, I moonlight as a wannabe Warren Buffett.

- Long walks – Because deep conversations deserve scenic routes.

- Freehand exercise – Gymming? Nah, but push-ups on a whim? Always.


Work & Location: 

Occupation: Technical Lead & Manager (IT). Basically, I solve problems (and occasionally create them).

Work from home setup, but can relocate for the one – Delhi isn’t glued to my soul.

Salary - Comfortable enough to support a good life and some adventures. Happy to share details when we connect.

The Fun Diet Section:

- Mostly veg but can occasionally be lured by butter chicken.

- Occasional drinker – because life’s too short for just soda.

- Non-smoker – because fresh air is underrated.


Partner Preferences:

I don't have any caste restrictions. But would prefer someone who:

- Has a balanced mind, mature heart, and a sprinkle of humor.

- Loves companionship and isn’t afraid to share the kitchen (and Netflix passwords).

- Bonus points if you have a zest for life and can match my enthusiasm for long walks and random debates.

If this sounds interesting (or if you’re just curious), let’s connect and see where this goes! DMs open. I can share JS profile if required. ",1,1736431536.0,reddmatch,1,1.0,False

For the last two weeks before this, I was having huge kicks and movements that would shake my whole stomach and happen every 20 minutes all day long. Starting the day before yesterday, they started to become weaker and less frequent. Yesterday morning they were even weaker and by the middle of the day they had stopped entirely for the rest of the day. I decided to go into labor and delivery at around 8:00 and the second I got there, specifically when they tried to put the monitor on, my baby was thrashing around like crazy. They weren’t able to get the monitor to stay on because I’m still not big enough yet. They ended up just using the Doppler for a minute and taking my blood pressure and then released so I really didn’t get any answers there. This morning it’s still really reduced, and I’m not feeling a lot of movement after eating and having my coffee. I’m feeling more than I was last night which is good, but not anything like I was getting used to. I just have a really bad feeling about this. I figured they weren’t really going to do much and just brush me off, that seems to be what emergency rooms and triages in my area do unless you’re in your third trimester. It’s like you and your baby don’t matter at all until you reach 30 weeks. It’s kinda irritating. I’m not sure what to do. I guess there isn’t much I can do, but was wondering if anyone has had this experience and what ended up happening with it. Thanks guys ",1,1736431470.0,BabyBumps,1,1.0,False

I am going out with a girl on Saturday, and atleast the convos have been amazing. I'm a bit split on the location, as I do have many alternate plans so some advice here would be great. 

I won't be driving, coz well, one of my dad's colleague's son died in an accident so he's a bit shaken and I'd wanna respect that. Also, I'm planning Dubai mall, so the traffic nowadays is horrific too. 

My ideas are:
1. Dubai Mall: Get some good coffee and dessert at one of the fancier cafes there (recommendations appreciated), and then go to the fountain boardwalk for a close up view, feel like that would be a lot nicer than standing in the crowd. I spoke to her and she was fine with the metro too so that's an option. 

2. Dubai Festival City: I saw the festival bay at Festival City and have been curious if it's worth it. Ik metro doesn't connect directly, so I may have to suggest going to creek and then water taxi, but festival city might be quiet and they have the dsf and festival bay going for it, but the connectivity is iffy. 

I'd welcome any opinions, tips and alternate plans too , preferably ones that aren't super far and easier without a car. I also have entertainer, so I've got quite a few offers as well

1hxdflc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1hxdflc/to_my_darling_wife_i_miss_you_so_much/,"To my darling wife, I miss you so much. ","It's been 4 weeks since you left me behind. 

  
I have experienced grief before, the death of my mother, my grandmother before her, close friends or their families, and various pets, but you have now shown me there is grief and then there is grief. 

  
I've been aware that there are stages of grief, and common wisdom is that there are 5 of them but learning more there is also a school of thought that there are 7. The five are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance with the 7 adding shock to the beginning and testing before acceptance.  In my previous grief, I felt sadness, and dismissed the stages to some degree, I mean there was shock, maybe some anger and depression, but it was always mostly sadness and acceptance. The most apt comparison I suppose I can give is panadol to morphine...

The thing about listing the stages, it sounds so clinical, and as if they are ordered, and maybe a progression. The reality is more like a chaotic cacophony of intense feelings. A coalescence of multiple - even as you lock some away. For instance, I have accepted that you are gone, that is the last stage, logic dictates that with acceptance, other feelings should be able to be controlled, but grief laughs at that notion. Anger, depression, shock come in waves, individually, in combinations, bits of denial and bargaining pop up from time to time too. Also missing from these stages are guilt, self recrimination, and rebuke, and the endless series of ""what if's"" that run through my head. Maybe these can all be lumped into trauma.

I always knew you to be bigger and more powerful than the body you lived in. In a way, that frail body that held you prisoner must have been made of really really tough stuff, because containing the essence of you must have required fortress levels of strength. 

It is now in your absence, I can fully see the size of the hole that is left, it is enormous. So many places where you are no longer there, where your absence, a palpable almost physical sensation, gives credence to the scale. The voids that are now scattered everywhere around me as I do things that you were part of, the silent yet screaming reminder of what was... They say you don't know what youve got til it's gone, but I knew what I had, I never took it for granted, but fed it, nurtured it, and it grew in and around me, I cannot help but miss it.

  
I find myself trying to explain to others what it is that you did for me, the way you grounded me, supported me, enabled me. Your belief in my capability and encouragement, wisdom and love helped me grow as a person, a leader, a friend, a human. I used to just say that you filled a Rachel shaped hole in my soul that I didn't know existed before you stepped into it. As I grew, as our relationship grew, that part of me grew with it. I have tools and strength now from that growth that are enabling me to function now. A gift from you that is still sustaining me. It is also painful, in that just by coping, I feel your touch, but I cannot touch you back. I see your influence but I cannot see you. I hear your words in my head, but you are not here. 

When I talked at your send-off, I described this as a unicorn horn to the heart. The pain I feel in missing you is horrendous. The knowledge that there are parts of you that have forged some of what is now the essence of me, those fragments are precious. They are a thing of beauty, wonder and joy. They hurt so much, but I am scared of the notion that I might lose sight of them, lose sight of you. They say with time, things get better, but I am terrified that if I lose the pain, I will lose some of you, so I question whether I want the pain to get better. I may want to nurture it, keep it, build a shrine to it - it is precious and priceless. Therefore, rather than things getting better, my aim is to try to get better while still holding onto this unicorn horn stuck in my heart, the pain is surely worth it.

We sent you off, hopefully in the way that you wanted, there were bright colours and without someone to stop me going over the top, I think I managed to hit peak pink while talking about you. I imagine you laughing at the depth of your grave - it was supposed to be 4 feet, but I reckon it was 7 - the choice to have me and others in attendance help fill the grave was lovely, - we still managed to fill it in under 45 minutes but it was hard yakka and part of me wonders if it was a bit of gravedigger humour. 

We fully covered you in flowers before giving you that blanket of dirt though, and your glittery pink shroud bearer (with genuine biodegradable glitter) and pink shroud covered in messages on paper hearts from everyone that loves you were truly a thing of beauty.If youre going to have a natural burial and become one again with nature, 

There was party fare including fairy bread, cupcakes, sausage rolls and soft drinks. We had tea and coffee for the ""grown-ups"" but my reckoning tells me only 1 person took that option. Its ok though I wont drink instant but dad gets a lengthy supply of nescafe, and will never run out of black tea again.

We tried to keep it joyous, you were always my joy, my heart, my love and you asked me to. You also asked that I try to look after myself - so I am setting myself the target of not getting bitter, I am not sure if it is achievable, but it is the target nonetheless. I know, because we spoke about it, that you want me to carry on, to keep living, to find more happiness. I cannot make promises that I will find happiness, but I can promise that I will at least give it a shot.

Its only 4 weeks, the last proper conversation we had, you thanked me for looking after you so well. I feel like a failure. How many things could I have done that night that may have changed the outcome? I will never know. 

My love, I am so sorry. You were the sun that lit my life, the center of my universe. Now, it all feels cold and dark. I know that you are no longer limited in fluid intake, in pain, exhausted. I do not believe in an afterlife, but if I am wrong, I hope you are living the best one there is, and that one day I can join back with you. If as I suspect there is not, then while I will try not to rush to it, I look forward to joining you in the nothing that comes next.

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1hxdezw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hxdezw/airbnb_management_service/,Airbnb Management Service,"So, you’ve decided to level up your Airbnb game and help out hosts who are drowning in their to-do lists. That’s awesome! You’re like the superhero of hospitality, swooping in to save the day. Let’s break this down, shall we?

### Listing Management

1. **Centralized Dashboard**  
   Think of a control center where hosts can manage every aspect of their listing. This would include tracking bookings, managing availability, and adjusting pricing in real-time. It’s like playing air traffic controller—except you’re directing guests to their cozy home away from home instead of jets.

2. **Cleaning Coordination**  
   Here’s where things can get a bit messy (pun intended). Establish a network of reliable cleaning services that hosts can access. You could create a feature where hosts can schedule cleanings between bookings with just a few clicks. Or, even better, implement a checklist that not only ensures the place is spotless but also gives hosts peace of mind knowing they’re compliant with hygiene standards. Include a “cleaning score” that feedback from guests can influence. Nothing beats that warm feeling of knowing you’ve crushed it on cleanliness!

3. **Automated Messaging System**  
   Communication can be the grease that keeps the wheel spinning. Implement automated messages that reach out to guests at strategic points: booking confirmation, check-in instructions, and even a follow-up thank you. Don’t forget those personal touches though! Maybe throw in that quirky, “If you hear creaking, it’s just the house settling—don’t worry, it’s not about to turn into a horror movie.” Hosts need to strike the right balance between efficiency and warmth. 

### Marketing to Hosts

1. **Create a Value Proposition**  
   What pain points do your potential clients have? Time. Stress. Uncertainty. Craft messaging that speaks to these issues. Emphasize how your services free up time for hosts to actually enjoy their lives. “Spend less time cleaning and more time sipping coffee on your porch watching the world go by.” Visualize their relief—seriously, you need to paint a picture!

2. **Community Success Stories**  
   Share real-life testimonials of hosts who’ve turned their business around thanks to your help. Stories are powerful—like the time I tried taming my hair during a windstorm and realized I needed a better approach. Real-life examples not only lend credibility but also inspire others to join in.

3. **Engagement on Social Media**  
   Utilize platforms that resonate with potential hosts. Facebook groups, Instagram reels, TikTok videos—nothing says “look at this amazing Airbnb” like a little swipe-right action on a dazzling property. Share tips, tricks, and behind-the-scenes peeks into the cleaning process. Remember to teach hosts how to come across as approachable humans, not just money-making machines. 

4. **Free Workshops/Webinars**  
   Hosting a get-together, even virtually, can be a bright beacon for hosts looking to elevate their game. Cover topics like best practices for communication or how to curate the perfect guest experience. Who wouldn’t want to sharpen their skills over some coffee? (Or maybe a glass of wine—because, let’s be real, sometimes you need that after a long week).

### Wrap-Up

Ultimately, you’re not just offering a service; you’re building a community. When hosts feel supported, they’re more likely to offer a magical experience to their guests. And that’s what it’s all about, isn’t it? Helping one another grow, laugh, and navigate this wild ride we call life—together. Now, let’s get out there and connect some hosts with a little less stress and a whole lot of joy!",1,1736431284.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

(Message me privately if you are too embarrassed, no problem). 2) do you think my flare ups are primarily from hot cocoa / instant coffee? 3) how soon do you know what irritated you? Unfortunately, my biggest symptom occurs during bowel movements so I am not forsure of my food triggers til like 20 hours later!!! Sure I cough when I bend over, or have an upset stomach, or the not being able to swallow thing, but the panteprozal seems to reduce those symptoms where I am left with the butt skin problem. 4) is my Paxil making my acid reflux worse? P.S. I have only been drinking rum & cokes about once per month, but Christmas and New years being so close together may have triggered me too. I have zero problems to quit drinking, it’s the hot cocoa with instant coffee I’ll miss so much.

Currently, my plan is to buy the rug photo'd to fit this space - it is rectangular, measuring 120x170cm. I have marked out where it would fall on the photo of my living area.

1. Does my chosen rug fit with the current style of my sofa? I am likely to change the TV unit but this was a gift, whilst I get on my feet.

2. Do I need a bigger rug? The next size up is 160x230 which feels a bit too big to me as it would reach to just below the back legs of the sofa. If there's an ideal size, it would be nice to know.

Apart from this, I have dark brown square dining table with 2 chairs with natural colour cushion pads.  
I planned to get either black nesting tables or a small black coffee table- maybe with a thick base.

I was pretty happy with my hamster even without a camera but sometimes I'd go days without seeing a trace of him. I knew he's fine as food would disappear and his sand bath had pee marks but would wonder what he's up to when I'm not around. 


He is generally tame and sociable, but at his whim, he can get timid and sneaky for days at a time. Some nights, I stayed up all night in the room where his enclosure is located, so I could see him running on the wheel and stuff.


I've finally installed a camera in his enclosure and it's life-changing! I can see his enclosure even when I'm not home, I automatically get video recordings/notifications when he's active.

1hxdb2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hxdb2r/long_time_reader_first_time_poster_first_and_only/,"Long Time Reader, First Time Poster - First (and only) Love","I, M (24) have been single for 5 years since a breakup with my only girlfriend of 3 years. Just putting some of it into words for once.

For context, we have been in and out of each others lives directly and indirectly since infant age. Both having moved with families a number of times to different parts of the world and on every occasion found ourselves in the same place together again. Possibly a bit of a fate idea if you believe in it....

Just before we were both 16, we began to show a love interest in each other, which then developed and flourished. This lasted for 3 years. The entirety of our relationship was healthy.

She then went to college as I began a professional career, putting our relationship into a medium distance situation. Determined to overcome the distance, I travelled weekly to visit her or arranged travel for her to visit me.  Between visits, her parents and I would catch up over a coffee etc. She's an only child and they honestly treated me like a son they never had.

After a couple of months, she returned home for a week. On the day she returned, we went for dinner, drinks etc. and returned to her family home. Nothing was out of the ordinary. Having gone to sleep that night, she woke me up in the middle of the night, accused me of cheating on her with a colleague and declared the end of our relationship. There was absolutely no basis to her accusation as I absolutely did not cheat on her or do anything to even suggest such a thing. I still don't understand it.

Fast forward 5 years, I've moved two-three times again around the world for employment but each opportunity felt more like an excuse to distance myself further from her and what we had to try and get over it. We've had minimal contact in the time but have mutual friends. Through our mutual friends, we still find ourselves interested in what the other is doing and how they are. We both have a natural draw to each other that doesn't hide. Which is incredibly difficult as she's the girl I thought I would marry and raise a family with, I haven't met anyone since that comes close to being like her.

So now I find myself about 10,000 miles from her, 5 years on and evidently from above, she still occupies my mind. I haven't fallen out of love with her in the time that's passed. In my occupation I'm sometimes exposed to risks/dangers that could ultimately kill me. I don't want to live with any regrets and if I still feel right now how I felt about her 5+ years ago, why can't I bring myself to break this whole ""no contact"" thing and let her know? What if there's a chance we could try again? What if it were to work out and be a ""happily ever after""? As you can imagine or know all too well yourself reading this, there's one million and one What If's...

1hxd951,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/1hxd951/believe_it_or_not_many_people_prefer_not_to_own/,"Believe it or not, many people prefer not to own the means of production","Socialists almost always talk about owning the means of production (MoP) in positive terms. However, this is often not the case. 

1. These conversations typically work with the underlying assumption that the business in question is a highly profitable one. Socialists typically envision an Apple or NVIDIA. They're not thinking about a highly risky startup with a 90% chance of failing or a 10 person landscaping company barely turning a profit or a corner coffee shop that's losing money. The latter examples are in fact far more common in reality.  

2. Many profitable companies are profitable because they seek profit. That's not a tautology. Under socialism, if we imagine that profit-maximization is disincentivized, then far fewer companies would make such profits and ownership of the MoP is much less beneficial.

3. Workers would need to buy in or front the capital somehow. Did you think owning the MoP was free? Where do you think the capital initially comes from? If workers own the MoP, then they provide the capital. That comes in the form of capital up front (not likely) or working for a reduced wage to gradually buy in. Oh, you want to take a loan from the government? Guess who becomes the co-signers on that loan: the workers.  

4. Pay is much less stable. In good years, you get extra, in bad years, you get less. We can observe this happening in co-ops that exist today. Many prefer stable wages.  

5. Much higher friction in the firing/hiring process. Want to jump ship under capitalism? Quit. It's that easy. Want to jump ship when you own the MoP? Not so easy. You'd have to get the company (or someone else) to buy back your share of ownership at a price that's likely undervalued due to illiquidity of capital ownership. Then you have to find another company to work for, buy into their company, and repeat the process over again. 

6. I've also heard the criticism that the only true risks capitalists face when their company goes belly up is that they risk becoming wage workers themselves. Fuck that, I'd rather you lay me off so I can find a better job then be permanently tethered to a sinking ship.

Given all of the above, the key thing to understand is that:

**Some people prefer not to own the means of production**

Some people would rather take a lower-risk, stable wage job. Under socialism, this is outlawed. Recall that one of the primary goals of socialism is to abolish exploitation and wage labor. Unless you're telling me workers are allowed to work for a wage if they choose to, in which case you're basically back to capitalism again. Remember, capitalism is not the private ownership of the MoP, it's the private *or* public ownership of the MoP. ",2,1736430794.0,CapitalismVSocialism,2,0.67,False

This is my first Reddit post. I'm coming here for some insights and advice on the fact that my boyfriend was complaining on how I should pay for half of the bill on our dates.

Some background information: my boyfriend and I have begun dating 5 months ago or so. We don't live together. I'm 28F and he is 26M. His salary is 5x mine and atm im in between jobs. My boyfriend has always been willing to pay the bill on our dates & I offer to cover for the bill probably 20% of the times (maybe less). I treat him into homemade food occasionally and try my best to pour into his cup emotionally. Since he makes more money than me I never felt obligated to cover for half the bill but rather cover the full bill rarely & half of it occasionally. However, today my boyfriend was expressing dislike of my behavior during occasions that he asks for me to cover for the bill. He was insinuating that I was acting upset when he asked me to cover for the bill (which has happened the last couple of times). I was only a bit upset on him ordering fancy desserts and then at the end of the date asking for me to pay when he ordered 2 things & I ordered just 1. Now to be honest I don't mind spending money on my loved ones much, but in this case it's my boyfriend who makes 5x as much as me and the bill to our dates is usually not over 15 $ (usually less since it's mainly coffee dates). Is it fair for me to cover for half the bill anytime we go out? 
Ps: I never ask him to ever pay fort things such as clothes & make up. However, I do get ready for our dates - dress well, do my hair& make up, and put effort into smelling as good as possible. ",1,1736430548.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
1hxd4n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hxd4n5/quitting_caffeine_was_way_easier_than_i_expected/,Quitting caffeine was WAY easier than I expected,"35m - Caffeine free for 44 days now. Averaged 2-3 cups of coffee a day + soda/energy drinks for 17 years. I stopped because I barely felt the effects anymore and I was getting some heart palpitations while working out. 

I had been thinking about quitting caffeine for a while (maybe a year), I just wanted to be back at baseline and not need it to function in the mornings. 

About 3 months ago, I decided I'd stop for just 4 days. It was challenging and I did get headaches, but they were easily manageable with Tylenol. Knowing that it was just for a few days made it easy to push through. 

Then about a month after that, I decided I'd go for 8 months. Cold turkey. It was weird, I did not get headaches this time at all. I didn't even feel that tired to be honest, and I wonder if my earlier 4-day abstinence had anything to do with that. It must have, because I kept expecting to be groggy and absent-minded and I honestly felt fine. 

I'm cruising now. I don't even think about coffee/caffeine. I wake up and just feel normal. I think there's a good chance I'll continue beyond the 8 month mark - because I don't see a reason to go back. I drink herbal tea in the mornings and when I go to coffee shops with friends. Mint, lemon-ginger.  

Posting this because I see a lot of ""The cravings are SO HARD, this is awful"" type of posts, and I think it may not be as difficult for everyone out there thinking about quitting. I fully expected it to be extremely difficult, and it was like a 2/10 on the difficulty scale. 

It's nice to not need anything. I'm super stoked on this. Give it a shot, and try a 3 or 4 day stretch before jumping in. Just my experience.",9,1736430401.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

Hello everyone, I am not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this question but here I am. I am dealing with a lot of things and would like to ask if anyone experienced similar issues, and how to heal from this. This will be a long post since I would like to address everything.

I had no problem since university. I am smart person and I like challenge. I am in STEM and I was top of my class. Of course I had experienced lots of obstacles especially since I have anxiety. But nothing like this. Then I lost someone, and entered long grieving period. I couldn’t work, could do anything and nothing seemed important. Time passed, I was still pretty sad but I had this feeling that I had to do everything so I started masters as well. It was hard, since I was taking master class, doing research, and trying to finish my double major. I succeeded somehow but it felt always like I could have done better but tried to do more. Then covid hit, I was still working because of my PI. I had covid 5-6 times, I know this because we got checked regularly. Then I started to experienced this thing. I was always tried, still I am. I couldn’t focus anything. I feel like I have a layer in my eyes and in my brain that blocks something’s. I feel like I am in a party with lots of conversation happening near me and I cannot focus on anything. It’s like white noise all the time. I thought I got burned out or maybe it is a long term covid effect. So I take 3-4 months before my PhD to rest. I didn’t do anything but I couldn’t get rest. Now I am doing PhD, but everything is so hard. 
When I wake up in the morning I am exhausted, it is so hard to get out of bed. All day all I can think of going home and rest. And I don’t get rest. I am having really hard time to understand what I am reading. I’m starting and puff my focus is gone. Sometimes all day I am trying to focus so I can do something but cannot. I thought maybe I am lacking something so I got my blood work get done. I have low vitamin D and iron which I try to supplement but this feeling is not going anywhere.I tried other supplements to improve cognitive health my I couldn’t see any difference either. I am mostly eating home cooked meals. I do try to exercise. Nothing made significant difference. I was doing fasting, then I tried high protein diet, no coffee, tried to sleep better, tomodoro method and others. They are not bad but not that effective. I am so tired of feeling like this. I am not even sure if that makes any sense. I tried to talk with couple of doctors but nothing come out, as soon as they saw my iron they said it is normal. But it was always low and I had no problem before. I miss old me, sharp me, smart me. I feel like I am stuck and don’t know what to do. Is there anyone who experiences similar things and then gets rid of? I tried to write everything but if I forgot I will add it also. Thank you in advance",2,1736429773.0,BrainFog,0,1.0,False

I’m a 21-year-old guy who recently moved to Surrey, and I’m hoping to make some new friends around here! I’m not looking to come off as creepy or weird—just a chill dude who wants to meet some people.

If you’re up for grabbing a coffee, heading to the pub, or just hanging out and chatting, let me know! I’m up for whatever, whether it’s exploring the area, swapping Netflix recommendations, or figuring out which pub has the best pint.

Feel free to shoot me a message or drop a comment if you’re interested. Looking forward to meeting some friendly faces around Surrey!

I'd really appreciate some advice and tips as I (25M) and going to meet a girl (24M) on a first date on Saturday. We met in hinge and have been talking off the app, and it's been good, and I have a feeling that she likes me too, and we match on many things like political opinions, interests, opinions in general and religious beliefs. 
So I've got a few questions that I hope I can get answers for:
1. Is a coffee and walk (with a surprise show that I've planned) a good first date? I don't drink so a date over drinks didn't make sense imo. My plan was coffee and then we catch a show for an event and than have some dessert. 
2. Is it weird to travel with her in the metro to the mall we're heading to for the date? I proposed a cab but she said the metro will atleast not see the crazy traffic that drivers have to, but I feel taking her in the metro might be off-putting?
3. I'm going to be going out of country for a few months, found that recently and haven't spoken about this yet, she plans to move for some experience as well, so it's not like it's out of the picture, but how do I talk about this? 
4. And tips on dressing for the date? I suggested she wear comfy shoes to the mall, and she said she isn't wearing shoes on a first date, so the bar is high for me now. 
5. What's the consensus on some gifts? She's a potter head and I was gonna get this bracelet or some pendant, but my friend said that would be too much so stick to flowers. What would you say, flowers and a card(her bday was last week so)? 
6. Any tips additionally might be great, like the touch barrier, I can talk comfortably, but I hesitate to go in for the hug directly with a girl, so how should I navigate that, and in general. 
7. Also, she's smashing it in her career, and I'm still looking for a good position, so mentally that's there too

Our conversations have been amazing, I had issues with unsendjng and editing messages, and she called me out on it and said that hopefully she can get me comfy, so oddly in my head, the Guruji Ka, koi tumse pyaar kyun karega is running.

I never ever thought I would fall in love so truly so fast, but the past month and a half have been the happiest of my life, or at least the happiest since I was like 7 years old. I don't even know where to start because I don't think I can manage to fit that much of what I love about him so much into a coherent post right now, but I just adore him so much.

He's just so sweet and understanding and compassionate. Even though generally his presence literally makes me more comfortable and at ease than anything or anyone else in the world, there have just been two or three times that I've gotten weird waves of what I assume is anxiety-induced nausea near him - first when we were getting coffee together right before our first time, and just yesterday after we were hanging out playing board games with some of his friends (which was fun, but took a lot out of me). Every time that happens, he's so tender about it, holding my hand, rubbing my back, speaking softly and patiently.

And I cannot get over how perfectly matched we are in every single possible way. We're each other's wildest dreams in the bedroom. We both dream of starting a family, and we both value open, clear, honest communication. He lets me yap about all my niche interests and show him my comfort movies, and he gives me snacks which are extra meaningful because food is a really big deal to him. We got each other amphibian plushies for Christmas - he got me an axolotl and I gave him a frog. We're both queer, albeit in ways we find difficult to decisively label, and we get to have the most wonderful, open discussions about identity, expression, attraction, and more. He just makes me so happy, this post doesn't even do him justice at all. The way he teases me gives me butterflies. His hugs and kisses and the way he holds my hand every time we walk somewhere together all melt my heart. He makes me feel so seen and accepted and liked and loved, more than anybody ever has in my life. He is my safe space and my angel and so much more. And he is so adorable.

I never used to feel very tethered to my own future, but he gives me a sense of direction. I feel like we're building a life together, and he makes me feel excited to get older if I'm doing it alongside him. I think he was genuinely made to be mine; there's no other explanation for how perfectly compatible we are. I just want to give my whole life to him, he is my comfort and my greatest cheerleader and I hope that I make him even half as happy as he makes me.",5,1736429493.0,love,2,1.0,False

It's especially frustrating when people completely ignore Karanveer's behaviour, which is, frankly, far more problematic.

First of all, I hope Karanveer's fans are aware that his pet name in the house is ""Mitti Ka Tel"" (Kerosene). That should tell you something. People are so quick to label Vivian as misogynistic while turning a blind eye to Karan's constant needling and instigation. There's a huge difference between the two, and unless you're into the ""bad boy with daddy issues"" type (in which case, hey, you do you, Karanveer is your guy), it's hard to understand the double standard.

Vivian might come off as arrogant, but he's also self-aware. He doesn't go around poking people unnecessarily. Karan, on the other hand, *loves* to poke and make personal remarks. It's his go-to strategy. Even when everyone's parents entered the house, Karan was still acting like ""Mitti Ka Tel,"" trying to stir up trouble.

Let's look at some specific examples:

* When Karan pushed Sara, Vivian actually listened to her side of the story, even though he had his own issues with her. He gives people the benefit of the doubt, something Karan rarely does.
* Karan has never given Shrutika a fair chance, despite knowing how close she is to Chum. He's consistently dismissed her and refused to accept her. This speaks volumes about his inability to accept people who don't align with his agenda. He hates strong opinionated women, a pattern we've seen throughout the show.
* Remember when Vivian fought for Avinash against Kashish? Even after that, Kashish's mom met Vivian like a loving son, even saying she’d only leave after having coffee made by him. That speaks volumes about Vivian's character.
* Even though Vivian and Shrutika have clashed, even Shrutika's husband acknowledged that Vivian is generally a well-liked person. Again, this points to a fundamental difference in how these two men conduct themselves.
* And perhaps the most telling example: after the last task, even if Vivian won and Chum was injured, he immediately went to her and asked for two minutes to apologize. When was the last time Karan sincerely apologized to anyone? I honestly can't recall.

The list goes on and on...

The point is, there's a clear contrast between Vivian's and Karan's behaviour. One is arrogant but ultimately fair, respectful and willing to listen, while the other is consistently instigating, dismissive, and manipulative.

Bigg Boss is a *reality* show. Winning the game isn't everything. You're putting your real personality on display for the world to see. So, if you're willing to cheat, betray, or stoop low to win, that's what people will remember you for. It's not just about the final score, it's about the kind of person you reveal yourself to be.

So, please, let's stop with the simplistic ""Vivian is misogynistic"" narrative. It's a lazy and inaccurate assessment that completely ignores the far more concerning behaviour of Karanveer.",1,1736428938.0,biggboss,10,0.51,False

2️⃣ Experiencing a lack of fulfillment or satisfaction in your personal or professional life

3️⃣ Finding it challenging to make decisions or set future goals

4️⃣ Overwhelmed or constantly stressed, even in non-stressful situations

5️⃣ Struggling to find joy or meaning in things that once made you happy

6️⃣ Physical symptoms like headaches or muscle tension without a clear cause



If so, it may be time to revitalize your routine. Here are some super simple steps to help you:



🌅 Embrace Natural Light: Start your day by stepping outdoors to soak in the sunrise. Just 15 minutes can help regulate your circadian rhythm and uplift your mood.



☕️ Delay Caffeine: Wait at least one hour before having your first cup of coffee to allow your body to wake up naturally. Too much early caffeine can lead to midday crashes!



🏃 Get Moving: Incorporate movement into your daily routine, whether aiming for 10,000 steps or engaging in intense exercise. Physical health is closely linked to mood and cognitive function.



📱 Take Screen Breaks: Regularly take breaks from your devices. Look at distant objects outside to reset your focus before going back to screens.



🥩 Choose Whole Foods: Give your body a break from processed foods. Include fresh fruits, vegetables, red meat, raw honey, and raw dairy for optimal nutrition.



🧠 Stimulate Your Mind: Engage in activities that challenge your brain, like reading, puzzles, or learning new skills.

My brother is making tea and coffee, and he and my dad nonchalantly tell me that my brother has killed and buried multiple women as if it is no big deal. And I can see the women he has killed. And I woke up frightened. I don't know what this means. I don't feel safe with my brother; he is a very angry person, and I don't like being around him. Maybe my brain just took my hatred for my brother and the fact that he is super sexist and made him into the worst thing ever. 

I don't think my brother could be a cable of something like this. As I am writing this, I realized that before I fell asleep, I was thinking about when my dad told me that my brother told him how he doesn't feel very empathetic towards people. And since serial killers are usually psychopaths and don't feel guilt or remorse for their actions, maybe that made my brain make him a serial killer in my dream. I don't know.

We’ve been together for 4 years and it’s been great and I’ve gotten along with his mom very well. We went out to dinner and when The bill came and the waiter placed it between my husband and I and since it was his birthday dinner I grabbed it to pay  and she said “oh are you going to pay for this or act like you are and use his credit card” and so I said “no…I’m using my credit card…” and showed her and then I said “what is this? My roast?” Jokingly because that was rude as fuck and she said “You’ve been testing me ever since you got married” and I looked at my husband and we were both confused so I asked how so and she said because now I say whatever is on my mind and I told her I have ALWAYS said exactly what’s on my mind and she said while laughing “no you didn’t haha” in like the fakest fucking condescending laugh ever so I said “yes I have, we’ve even had conversations about it” and once again while laughing she said “hahahaha (pause) no, you didn’t” super fucking bitchey. 
My husband and I have no idea why. I do so much for her without her even asking. I sit and have coffee with her because she’s lonely, I dug out her car in the snow, whenever im on my way home i ask her if she needs me to stop anywhere for something or tell her if im going to a store, we include her in every little fucking thing we do which now I’m so annoyed over because we never have quality time together because she’s always with us, I buy her lunch and dinner every time we go out…so I absolutely did not deserve that comment and embarrassment especially on hi birthday and as I’m paying for her dinner. My husband was just as shocked as I was and when we got home I cried for an hour because of how hurtful that was and my eyes were puffy and swollen. My husband was comforting to me but now he’s angry because I told him I need to set boundaries and I won’t be going over her house without him and doing all the extra things I do. She’s our Next door neighbor and lives alone so he is all she has. He doesn’t see it but she’s very manipulative of him, guilting him if he doesn’t go over and spend a few hours with her every day. She texts him every morning at 6am and all day and always before bed. He is a wonderful man and I’m so glad he treats her so well but he doesn’t see how she is manipulating him. It’s only ever been the 2 of them since he was 16 so he had to step up and help with everything. He understands that I’m upset and has comforted me and has told me our marriage is what’s important and that I’m a great DIL to her but now he’s giving me the cold shoulder because I don’t want to go and make up with her right now and want to set boundaries.

[Chefman Crema Supreme],"Hi! My wife is a coffee fanatic. She never really cared for espresso much, but recently we went to D.C. and a little breakfast shop made her coffee and she fell in love with it. The server told us she made it by taking a single shot of espresso and topping it with hot water and steaming it. She also told us the brand of beans.

I went and bought her an espresso machine (nothing too fancy since this is her first non-drip machine) and found the beans online. I can’t be entirely sure I got the same blend/roast, though. I’ve been following the directions to make sure that I’m getting the right pressure reading on the machine and all. I haven’t been able to nail it though. She says it’s still good but not the same. Thing is I hate coffee. I can’t stand the flavor. So, I can’t really dial it in. I don’t know where to go. I could ask her to describe what’s off, but I wouldn’t know what to change.

Does anyone have any advice for someone that hates the stuff, but adores their wife and wants to give them all their favorite things?  What probing questions should I ask? what types of answers could I expect? what adjustments could I make depending on the answers?

Machine: Chefman Crema Supreme  
Beans: Filicori Zecchini Delicato  
Roast Level: Medium Roast  
Grind: I'm setting right in the middle on medium and using the single shot setting  
Roast Date: I cannot find a date other than the Expiration date of 03/2027, which is probably arbitrary.  It is also stamped with ""LA7673"", so maybe that's a lot number?  


I can get the dose, time, and other important measurements if they will be helpful.  I never thought there would be that much intricacy to it.  Please go easy on me, I know next to nothing about this stuff, but I love her to pieces.",2,1736427967.0,espresso,4,0.75,False

I have a crema problem that I hope the group can help me with. The issue is that my espresso shots produce very little crema. I am using a Breville Bambino Plus and a Baratza Encore grinder set at 18, which is the lowest setting I can use without the Bambino choking. The coffee beans are dark roast and fresh, although I don't think the freshness of the roast should matter because crema is an emulsion of water and the oils in the beans. As long as the beans retain their natural oil content, the elements for crema should be present.

I use a leveler on the grounds and a spring-loaded tamper that guarantees 22 lbs of force. I also use the stock single-wall portafilter filled with 9 grams of coffee. The water used is distilled. I believe these are the key details. I look forward to hearing everyone's advice.",1,1736427902.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I was on the couch, scrolling through my phone while a news anchor droned on in the background. I didn’t pay much attention until the power flickered, and the screen went black.  

A low hum filled the room, and then the TV turned itself back on. But it wasn’t the news anymore.  

At first, it was static. Then the image sharpened.  

A man appeared, sitting at a news desk. His suit was torn and dirty, his tie askew. His face was gaunt, his skin sallow under harsh lighting. He wasn’t reading from a teleprompter—he was staring directly into the camera, his wide, bloodshot eyes fixed on me.  

“This is a warning,” he said. His voice was raspy, each word trembling with urgency. “If you’re watching this, they’ve found you.”  

A chill ran down my spine. My first thought was that it was some kind of prank, a pirate broadcast maybe. But something about his eyes... they were filled with raw terror.  

“They’ll come to your door. They’ll knock. Do not answer. They’ll sound like people you know, people you want to help. But they are not human.”  

I reached for the remote, but it didn’t work. The TV’s buttons wouldn’t respond either.  

“They feed on fear,” the man continued, his voice dropping to a whisper. “If you’re afraid, they’ll know. And once they know, there’s no escape.”  

The screen went black again.  

I sat there in the silence, heart pounding, until the knock came.  

It was soft at first—three polite raps against the door.  

I froze.  

“Hello?” a voice called. It was a man. He sounded calm, friendly even. “Sorry to bother you. My car broke down, and I need to call for help.”  

My mind raced. Could it be true? Was this some bizarre coincidence, or had the broadcast been real?  

The knock came again, louder this time.  

“Please,” the man outside said. “It’s freezing out here.”  

The TV crackled to life. The man was back, but now his suit was soaked with blood, his face pale and trembling.  

“They’ll lie,” he hissed. “They’ll do anything to get in. Do not—”  

The screen distorted, his face flickering into static, and then the TV shut off entirely.  

The knocking stopped.  

For a moment, I let myself breathe. Maybe it was just someone looking for help. Maybe I was overreacting.  

Then I heard footsteps—slow, deliberate—moving around the outside of my apartment. A second later, a new knock came, this time at the window.  

I turned my head slowly.  

A face stared back at me. It was a man, but his features were wrong. His eyes were too large, his smile too wide, like someone had stretched human skin over something that didn’t know how to wear it.  

“Let me in,” he said, his voice perfectly calm, but hollow, echoing unnaturally in the small space.  

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the coffee table. The door rattled as something began pounding on it, harder and harder.  

The man at the window smiled wider, his lips splitting, revealing rows of sharp, glistening teeth. “You can’t run,” he said, his voice overlapping with itself like multiple people speaking in unison.  

I bolted for the bedroom, slamming the door behind me. My hands shook as I locked it and grabbed my phone. No signal.  

The pounding continued, now coming from the bedroom window.  

I looked around for a weapon—anything to defend myself. My eyes landed on the closet. Maybe I could hide, wait it out.  

As I moved toward it, the TV in my bedroom flickered on.  

The man was there again, barely recognizable now. His skin was peeling away, revealing something dark and pulsating beneath.  

“You can’t hide,” he said, his voice breaking. His eyes locked onto me, and for a moment, I thought I saw pity. “They already have you.”  

The pounding stopped.  

Silence fell, thick and suffocating. Then I heard it.  

A soft, wet breathing.  

It was coming from behind me.  

Slowly, I turned toward the closet. The door was slightly ajar, just enough to see the darkness inside.  

Something moved.  

And then, as I stood frozen in place, the door creaked open wider.  

Inside was the man from the TV, grinning up at me with hollow eyes and a mouth full of sharp, glistening teeth.  

He stepped out, his movements jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings. “I told you,” he whispered, his voice layered and wrong. “There’s no escape.”  

The last thing I saw was his smile.",3,1736427264.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I wanted to spread out pages and make notes freely, kind of like working on a big desk. Since I couldn't find an app that did this exactly how I wanted, I decided to learn Swift and build it myself!

It took me 13 months of learning and coding (lots of coffee ☕️), but I finally got it working! Built it using SwiftUI and UIKit - went from zero coding knowledge to publishing my first app.

About privacy, I take this seriously! The app works completely offline and doesn't collect any data at all. You can check the App Store privacy section which shows ""Data Not Collected"" 😊

You can try it free (up to 10 PDF pages/images adding and 2 canvases). If you find it useful, you can upgrade to Pro for unlimited adding with just a one-time fee, no subscriptions ever!

During the beginning of the 3 years, we were part of a toxic group (4 ppl including us) and none of us liked her because of her clingy behaviour and we used to just isolate her.

And then me and another girl from the group for into a fight and the group broke apart.
Then after two months or so we grew close and then we became bsf.

There were many moments during those 3 years when I thought she was clingy or annoying. I tried to let it go because I thought I won't find another friend like her.

And we had a school trip, she was acting like a dumb b the whole trip so I acted btchy towards her for being so 

-because of her i didn't get to sit next to my other friend 
-she kept demanding for the window seat so I got up and sat at another window seat (letting her have that window seat), then she kept on nagging about it
-she was taking way too much time getting ready and made me wait till she was ready to leave the room
-she spiled coffee on herself then went to the room to clean herself and left the key in the room (we were supposed to submit the key and leave that day)

Whenever she brings up this (that I was being btchy the entire trip) I get annoyed by her but I don't have the guts to tell her that she was acting like that

And she called me stupid once which kinda hurt me. (Sounds stupid but I get offended easily, and she shouldn't have said so)

And she LOVES to make me feel stupid all the time
She never agrees with me
She always points out the flaws in whatever I say
She doesn't take no for an answer 
She gives out unnecessary advices and critics
She used to make hurtful comments on my parents (because they called her once and told her to stay away from me)

I just hate being with her.

1hxbwik,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1hxbwik/the_body_is_super_odd/,The body is super odd,"So I came out the Christmas holidays feeling rather pleased. I had put on a little weight but not nearly as much as I expected. 

Note, I enjoy holiday periods with the family and don’t want to be the guy saying; nope, I shan’t have that I’m fasting. Fasting is for the other 46 (birthdays, Christmas and vacation) weeks of the year. 

So I’d had a lot of carbohydrates, processed foods and alcohol. Generally alcohol is my vice and I prepare all my food from scratch through the year. I did so with Christmas lunch plus all trimmings too because I enjoy cooking. Over the period I cooked 4 pork belly’s, 2 hams, 2 beef briskets and a turkey in a pair tree 😉. 

Anyway, comes to Sunday and I begin a 30hr fast. All is well, I eat Monday night, a basic veg omelets type thing. I eat soy glazed Salmon 24 hrs later and then start fasting until this evening 48hrs when I’ve got a midweek roast for the family. I’m only having the pork (crackling of course), creamed spinach and brussel sprouts. Will do Yorkshires and roasties for the family though. 

So halfway through Tuesday I start needing to pee, really often. I kinda ignore it but two hours after the Salmon I think something is not right. I check my glucose (5.5mmol). No particular problem, I know I am pre-diabetic hence the fasting protocol to drop weight and get healthy. All yesterday I had frequent urges to pee. I’m starting to look stuff up on the internet now. Prostate, Diabetes, UTIs etc. I decide not to worry and sleep. Comes to wake up today the urge to pee frequently is gone. Drank a vat of black coffee between 9 and 12:30 and only just felt the need to go. 

So, I am racing towards 50, and have my first prostate check scheduled soon but could that reaction simply be my body getting rid of stored water after my holiday diet and back into ketosis? I was still drinking lots of water and coffee the last 4 days.",0,1736426415.0,intermittentfasting,4,0.43,False

Hello all ☺️ I hope this is an appropriate post and is my first ever on Reddit 🥳. I am 32 years old and currently undergoing the process to see whether I may have ADHD (this has not been confirmed yet to make that clear however I strongly suspect it will be). 

A LOT of things make so much sense when I put it through the lease of ADHD. 

As a child:
1. I really struggled in primary school to the point where a teacher said to my parents that I was ‘dumb’. And that I didn’t pay attention, daydreamed and refused to follow instructions on how to do work in class. I remember my feeling at the time wasn’t defiance just I could not retain the information being given to me, like my brain was clouded over. It was really upsetting because I just wanted to be like the other kids.
2. I would fidget incessantly in situations when I shouldn’t. I would climb anything and everything, like the checkout at supermarkets, my chair at school or the desk.
3. I had a hard time making friends due to my incessant chatter. Even adults found me hard work due to the amount I would talk. 
4. Genuinely forget homework or be incapable of sitting still and focusing to get it done. 

As an adult:
1. In my first jobs which were admin related I made so many careless mistakes even if I tried my best to focus. I’d get into trouble and developed extreme anxiety about my work containing mistakes. This is different now in my current job, as my work is checked constantly by many people (everyone’s work is) and that reassures me. 
2. I have poor volume control and talk loudly, too much, and often cut people off. I’ve learned to say nothing instead which has lead my manager to telling me that I really need to communicate more. And then sometimes I cannot stop myself from saying something which is top of mind. My manager says conversations with me are like a rollercoaster.
3. Extreme reactions to rejection and failure - this makes me want to burst into tears. This has been the root of bouts of depression where I hate myself for failing. University was a hard time for me, as I held myself to high standards and would spiral when I didn’t meet those standards. I had my baby 5 weeks early and felt this as my body failing me and suffered immensely with postpartum depression and feelings of worthlessness. 
4. Fear of being late as I am often late - I arrive ridiculously early for anything and everything because I know if don’t I’ll be ridiculously late. On time does not exist.
5. Difficulty following when people talk to me (I zone out) so focus extra hard to make up which can exhaust me. Or I’ve learnt to see what kind of tone the person is using and use a canned response ‘oh really? That’s so bad’ or ‘omg really?!’ Even if I don’t know what they’re on about. After weekends away with family or friends I feel like I need solitude to recharge.
6. Having had difficulties making friends I am ever the people pleaser and will always put essentially everyone before myself to make or keep friends.
7. Constantly losing things or forgetting things. I can make a coffee, get distracted and forget where I’ve put it. This happens with my keys, and phone but sometimes even with locking the house or leaving the key in the door. This causes a lot of arguments with my husband who thinks I do it on purpose. I don’t my brain just blacks out.
8. Always double booking or forgetting events/appointments. I have come to rely on my husband to remind me.
9. Trouble falling to sleep with racing thoughts.
10. Easily overwhelmed when I have a number of things to do in my personal and professional life. It makes me want to go hide in my bed and wake up once it’s done.
11. Avoidance of tasks or over planning to start a task way too early out of fear of missing deadlines.

I’ve realised I found ways to cope (working in short bursts then having to walk around a bit, working with a podcast playing to occupy my mind as I feel like my brain is utter chaos, not speaking to avoid overstepping, arriving stupidly early to avoid being late etc. and there’s loads more I feel could be associated but don’t want to bore you all.

Basically, after my novel above, I just wanted to reach out to see if you had experienced anything similar? This is all quite overwhelming and making me feel a bit emotional.

Thank you ❤️❤️

1hxbqfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1hxbqfs/i_saw_my_friends_husband_with_one_of_his_affairs/,I Saw My Friend’s Husband with One of His Affairs He Should’ve Blocked Long Ago… Part 2,"After reading all the comments on my previous post, I debated whether or not to contact her using my alternate account. She had already blocked me everywhere and even taken jabs at me through a few of her Instagram posts, making it clear she no longer considered me a friend or wanted to hear my side of the story.

Still, I felt there was one thing she needed to know. So, I sent her a link to my post through her DMs, along with the photo I had taken of her husband and his AP together. I thought that was all I could do and left it at that.

I didn’t expect her to reply, but to my surprise, she responded much quicker than I anticipated—and not in the way I thought she would. She threatened to sue me if I sent her one more message, claiming I had invaded her privacy, humiliated her online, and stalked her husband. She even said she wanted to put me in jail along with her husband and his affairs.

I wasn’t intimidated by her ridiculous threats, but the sheer contempt she displayed toward me stung deeply. I felt an even greater sense of betrayal and disappointment than before, so I decided to call her directly. That phone call turned into the biggest fight we’ve ever had.

She accused me of being some pathetic stalker obsessed with her marriage. I shot back, calling her the most pathetic one for being too blind to see who her real enemies were—letting her husband stab her in the back repeatedly while treating me like the villain. I knew my words would hurt her, but I couldn’t stop myself.

She screamed at me for a while, but eventually, as always, she calmed down. Then she claimed she already knew everything. She said she had allowed her husband to temporarily see his AP because he couldn’t let go of her, and she wanted to give him the space to work through his feelings. She explained that he had deleted all his dating apps in front of her, shared all his messages and credit card transaction history with her, and started acting like a super sweet husband after she agreed to him dating his AP. She sounded so confident, as if all of this somehow made everything okay. I’m still struggling to process what she said.

Toward the end of the call, she suggested that once I’d “calmed down,” we should meet up for coffee—with her husband. I couldn’t even respond. I just hung up. Why would I want to sit down with him after everything? The idea felt so absurd, so surreal.

Not long after, I noticed she had updated her Instagram story. It was a video of her husband playing sports, captioned with:

“Rationality, patience, and resilience are the three keys to winning a game… and in life too 🏆”

That was the final straw. I blocked her everywhere. I realized I’d wasted another day being caught up in this ridiculous situation.

And so, I’m here now, writing this second and final post.

To K,

If you ever see this, I want you to know that I never hated you, and I was never jealous of you. I never wished for your unhappiness. Whenever you cried or went through something hard, my heart broke for you. My concern and care were always for you, not your husband. The world doesn’t revolve around him, no matter how much you might think it does. Yes, there are terrible women out there, but there are also women who value loyalty and friendship above all else.

I want to talk about the things you’re refusing to see. Instagram doesn’t manipulate people. Dating apps don’t manipulate people. Your husband is the one manipulating you. And your followers—they’re not supporting you. They’re just sitting back and watching your life fall apart like it’s some kind of TV show. Lastly, you didn’t “let” him cheat on you. He’s always cheated, and he always will, whether you’re aware of it or not. He doesn’t respect you.

You told me you want to stop this nonsense and focus on your life and the real things. But as long as you stay with him, there will be no real things in your life—only this endless circus.",19,1736425805.0,Infidelity,14,0.96,False

Friendships formed in school or college are truly unique—like the ""Swiss Army knife"" of friendships. They’re multi-purpose, adapting to so many roles because they grow out of shared experiences during formative years.

In contrast, friendships in later life often seem more focused. For example, you might have one friend you meet for coffee, another you watch matches with, and someone else you run with. These relationships can feel more purpose-driven, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing—it’s just different.",23,1736425720.0,AskIreland,23,0.93,False

So ayun I 20F have a new friend 21F, and second time namin lumabas last week with our boyfriends who are best friends from highschool kasi we wanted to have coffee and hangout. I've known her bf (24M) for a few years na since matagal na kami ng bf ko (25M) and sila medyo bago pa, pag lapit ko sakanya I'm going to hug her and say hello sana pero she bluntly said ""pumayat ka"", and it's kind of frustrating kasi I've always been a bit insecure about struggling to gain weight, anyways, umupo nalang ako beside her after that and agreed kasi totoo namang mas pumayat pa ko lalo. Our conversation circles around asking questions about my school, my salary (I'm a working student), my physical appearance, kung natural ba hair ko (it's kulot medyo brownish because I'm mixed) and stuff like that, even those questions na nasagot kona through chat (since matagal na kaming magka - follow sa social media) and from our last hangout natanong nya na din, super repetitive ng mga tanong to the point where I feel like she thinks I'm lying because she's not hearing what she wants to hear. I brushed it off nalang but I honestly got kind of tired of answering the same questions but still gave her the benefit of the doubt 'coz why would I think she secretly hates me? I also just wanted to have a proper conversation kasi I really wanted to be friends with her. I tried to change the topic by asking how she's doing with her life, what music she listens to, where she wants to go if we ever want to hang out again habang nag uusap mga boyfriends namin. Then since naka order na kami ng coffee and we're waiting nalang, bigla sila kumain ng food na tinake out nila from another place in front of me and my bf ng walang pag aalok, it's not like we're hungry or makikihingi kami pero we felt awkward kasi nakatingin lang kami sakanila tas kami ng bf ko walang ginagawa, anyway nagtanong bf ko sakin if gutom ba ko since may tinake out din kaming carbonara from another place na diko naubos tas sabi ng gf nya gutom pa daw and asked if she can have it blahblahblah syempre my bf gumawa nalang palusot etc tas diko nalang kinain. So since awkward na, I try to start a conversation again and tinanong ko sya how their christmas went blah blah blah tas biglang she asks casually how much my boyfriend makes in a month tas nakita ko medyo nasurprise yung bf ko sa tanong nya so nag kwento nalang ako ng iba para di na nya kailangan sagutin, anyway inignore ko nalang hanggang makauwi but paghiga ko that night I realized I felt so uncomfortable pala that I went to bed crying.
 
Previous attempts: Wala pa, we're planning to tell her bf para maybe ma-open up nya sa gf nya because uncomfortable talaga mga ganung questions so we can talk to them about it next meet up pero I'm not sure pa pano yung approach 'coz I don't want them to think negatively of us.",1,1736425611.0,adviceph,3,1.0,False

I often see the same familiar faces, but I always find it tricky to just walk up to someone and ask if they'd like to grab a coffee with me.

Back in my school days at CHSB and my college years, I knew a lot of people in and around Chichester. But as time has passed, life has naturally taken us in different directions, and it's easy to lose touch.

These days, I'm hoping to change that and meet some new people, or even reconnect with those I might have crossed paths with before. If you're free between 1 pm and 2 pm and fancy a relaxed coffee break in Chi, let me know! Whether you're a fellow coffee enthusiast, enjoy a good chat, or just want to take a breather from the workday, it would be great to meet up.

No pressure, just a friendly way to make the lunchtime break a bit more social! 😊

1hxblxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1hxblxp/current_clone_collection/,Current Clone Collection,"Hello everyone! ❤️ I got into fragrances in the second half of 2024 and have since been building up my fragrance collection and enjoying the exploration of different scents. That also means I have purchasing clone fragrances as they are a fantastic intersection of affordability and quality.

Just thought I'd share the clone and Middle Eastern fragrances I currently have:

* Lattafa Eternal Oud
* Lattafa Teriaq
* Lattafa Teriaq Intense
* Armaf Odyssey Mega
* Armaf Odyssey Mandarin Sky
* Paris Corner Khair Confection
* Paris Corner Khair Fusion
* Paris Corner Khair Pistachio
* Lattafa Ajwaa
* Fragrance World Fierte
* Fragrance World Lumiere Garcon
* Lattafa Ameer Al Oudh Intense Oud
* Khadlaj Oud Al Sabah
* Lattafa Vintage Radio
* Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa
* Lattafa Bade'e Al Oud Honor & Glory
* French Avenue Spectre Wraith

So far my favourites have been Vintage Radio (absolutely love the smoothness of the wood with the soft plum and pepper notes), Khair Pistachio (I am a sucker for nutty fragrances, and the citrus with the pistachio which also leans into gourmand territory is just delectable for me), Spectre Wraith (dark chocolate, ground coffee beans, soil, and a hint of soapiness - a divisive combination but I personally love it), Lumiere Garcon (the date note in this amber fragrance is stunning), and Lattafa Ajwaa (a divisive scent profile with the liquorice, but it reminds me of salted Dutch liquorice candy - which is what makes me love it).

Would love to know if anyone else also has these fragrances (or has tried these fragrances) and their thoughts on them. I'm also up for recommendations. 😊

Cheers!

1hxbhvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1hxbhvl/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1736424929.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False
