1qo3vis,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/1qo3vis/is_dtss_still_worth_moving_to/,Is DTSS Still Worth Moving To?,"Hi all,

I moved to Maryland about a year and a half ago and currently live in the Wheaton area. For context: I work in DC and take the red line in 2-3 days a week. I’m mostly a homebody, but lately I’ve started getting out and exploring more—beyond just commuting for work. I picked Wheaton mainly for the spaciousness and the huge perk of not paying for parking. Now, though, I’m finding myself wanting to live closer to the ""action""—not so much nightlife (clubbing/lounges/parties), but walkable access to everyday amenities like restaurants, gyms, grocery stores, coffee shops, and similar spots.

My initial priorities were safety, cleanliness, proximity to the Metro, off-street parking, and in-unit laundry. Those all still matter, but now being closer to walkable conveniences is feeling more important as I get accustomed to living alone and exploring the area.

Wheaton isn’t boring, but most businesses aren’t a short walk (under 10 minutes), so I’m starting to reconsider Downtown Silver Spring (DTSS). My hesitation comes from hearing (and seeing) a lot of mixed opinions, which I will probably find more of in the comments:

* Some say Silver Spring “isn’t what it used to be” since Discovery left and that there’s an uneasy feeling walking around at night near Colesville and Georgia.
* I’ve noticed recurring complaints about expensive and less-secure parking (upwards of $120/month)—though maybe that’s a building-specific issue?
* There’s also a lot of chatter about declining “value,” but plenty of folks still live there and seem to enjoy it.

**Just to clarify, I’m not looking for apartment or building suggestions specifically—there are plenty of posts on that already. What I’m curious about is the overall experience of living in DTSS long-term or even just over a 12-month lease. Outside of convenience, is it a place people truly enjoy living? Or is it somewhere folks only stay because of proximity to work and transportation?**

I’m not into clubs or lounge nightlife, but I do enjoy dining out in the evenings, grabbing a drink for trivia, or taking part in casual neighborhood events. So if you live (or have lived) in DTSS:

* Are the concerns about safety at night, high parking costs, and “falling value” widespread, or just limited to certain buildings or streets?
* Are there neighborhoods within DTSS that offer a better overall experience and still give easy access to the Metro and walkable amenities?
* What’s your take on living there day-to-day: do you actually enjoy being out and about in Silver Spring, or does it feel like a place people put up with for the sake of convenience?
* Would you honestly recommend someone move to Silver Spring if they’re looking for enjoyability as well as practicality?

Just hoping to hear some genuine, firsthand perspectives—especially on what it’s like to actually live there and whether the negative rumors are justified or overblown.

Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts!",4,1769488309.0,SilverSpring,0,0.83,False

1qo3pz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qo3pz1/regretting_roommate_choice_but_might_be_stuck/,"regretting roommate choice, but might be stuck","so I (early-20's m) moved in with a friend (mid-30's m) a few months back, and it's starting to go downhill. initially, he said he was super diligent about cleaning, and I was honest and said I'm a bit messy, but would keep the chaos to my room, and make sure to clean up in common areas. fast forward, and it seems like there may have been some half-truths. sure, he keeps the kitchen clean, does dishes, takes out the trash, but the living room.. is a problem area. 

tldr: roommate has turned the living room into a messy second bedroom, keeps sleeping there despite having conversations about it, and I'm at a loss because I don't want to resent/hate my friend

the living room is kind of central in the apartment, it's the main entry and you have to go through it to get to the kitchen, and to the bedrooms/bathroom. it has also become his second bedroom. we have two couches, two coffee tables, and two TVs because neither of us wanted to toss our things, and his couch is where he exists most of the time. he eats there, watches TV and is on his phone the whole day, and usually ends up sleeping there, too. he gets home from work super late, so the whole being in the living room after midnight isn't such a huge deal, I'm usually asleep anyways. he also bluetooth connects his headphones to the TV, which genuinely helps a lot. but when I get up in the morning to feed my cat, make breakfast, or head out to work, or just want to chill on the couch, there's a good chance I'll find him passed out, snoring away.  even when he got sick, he just stayed camped out there, snoozing and sneezing and coughing all day and night (which is actually happening again right now, we're both a little sick)

and that's not even mentioning the pile of.. random stuff he leaves on the coffee table. he even fashioned himself a little trash can out of a gift bag. thankfully, the mess doesn't extend to my couch or table, but it's still uncomfy even when he's out to try and use my couch when there's a tornado right next to it. like, cushions and pillows and blankets all over the place, some kind of page scanner device, medication bottles, flossers, journals, empty containers, water bottles, just a bunch of random shit that probably would normally be on like a bedside table?

I've tried to figure out why it kept happening, met with various things. partially, it's because he smokes/vapes weed a lot (like A Lot, idk when the dude isn't at least a little stoned) and just ends up getting too high and falling asleep. another is that his room is too cold, which I tried to solve by getting him an ac cover, then letting him borrow my space heater I wasn't using, and now I've bought him a hopefully better heater. I'll wake him up sometimes cause he's got sleep apnea and the hella loud snoring turns into choking/coughing, he has a CPAP machine in his room, and I keep suggesting he maybe starts using it. he starts to properly use his room for a bit, but then just goes back to old habits. I was super hopeful one day when I'd invited a mutual friend to hang out, was stressed about having to host in a messy living room, but then came home to a completely cleaned up living room. I sent him a message thanking him for cleaning, it stayed nice for a few days, then back to living on the couch.

I know I'm to blame for letting it go on for so long, I'm working on my conflict-avoidant self, but clearly not doing great. in my list of excuses are that it's the first time I've lived with another person in about 5 years, I'm super anxious, and autistic. handling people is not a skill I have. especially trying to interact with someone who's not sober. it seemed to be hitting a certain point, he's acknowledging that he's gotta cut back on smoking, needs to sleep in his room, knows that his snoring bothers me, I thought we had a super productive conversation. but right now, he's been parked on the couch all day testing out ketamine for the first time.

I am going to have a real sit down talk with him about things. he's overall a nice guy, considerate about inviting over guests, we share a lot of friends, he looks after my cat when I'm gone. for that and also that I pay way less in rent than if I were to live alone, I'd like to keep living with him. and I know I'm also not the best roommate, I need to be better about deep cleaning, I'm usually holed up in my room and don't hang out with him very much, but it's been hard to do that given that I'm currently so unhappy with the current state of things. I'm nailing down the script with a friend, but if there's any other advice from people who have dealt with something similar (or needing to really go in on me for being a wimp), it would be appreciated ",1,1769487871.0,roommateproblems,2,1.0,False

I came here because impotently watching what is happening from social media was simply not working for my mental/emotional health. I arrived early Friday morning and have been protesting and trying to help however I can. 

Anyway today I spent most of the day at Whipple. I met some lovely people, and passed out snacks, supplies and caffeine. 

Around 8pm i left, to head back to my hotel. Right out of the Whipple complex a black car like a dodge viper began very obviously following me. 

I kept 5 under the speed limit, and this made it even more obvious. Everyone else passed me except them. I  didnt know who they were but i focused on driving carefully to give no excuse to get pulled over. I exit, and then turn and turn and they are still following me. I then pull off into a random side street. It's clear as day they are tailing me at this point and I am freaking the fuck out. (their turn signals are coming on after mine etc). I pull of to the side of this neighborhood road and they pass. 

I then continue, and a few blocks later they pick me up again. Again i'm careful and i'm getting more and more scared. I pull off into another random side neighborhood and again they follow me (signal on after mine)

This time they stop behind me. I get out of the car, i start walking towards them. They sped away.

Now, i'm not from here, i have out of state plates from my rental, and i just show up randomly trying to help at a protest, and connect with like minded people. 

Was this LEO? Or more likely was this ICE observers following me to find out if I'm an ICE plant?

If this was you or you know who it was: I'm truly sorry i arose suspicion with you. I am here to help. I don't need you to trust me, i just want you to accept my supplies. I will be at Whipple tomorrow with more hot chocolate and coffee and snacks. Please come chat with me. I'd love to put your mind at ease.

1qo3hus,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1qo3hus/hi_there/,Hi there,"Hello, how have you been? It’s been a couple of months since the last time I saw you, you had a black jacket that matched very well with your boots that day, I remember you were kinda sad, I think a bit confused, you had a lot in your head at that moment, a lot that I didn’t knew how to handle. You looked very beautiful but at the same time very sad, I tried my best for you to smile at anything.

I know you will never reply, I don’t intend for you to reply, I know you are happy now, I just wanted to tell you that it hurts.

I ran away after you ran away, I felt like my world was collapsing when you told me you were leaving I remember wanting to chase after your car, like a kid that doesn’t want to be left, like a dog that doesn’t want to be forgotten.

I remember feeling embarrassed, searching for closeness that you at that moment were not ready to give.

I remember walking through the whole city that day, trying to cope with the fact that you were gone, thinking, imagining I would see you on the next corner, and I did. Every woman had your face, every sip of coffee had your taste, even when the wind blow I could hear your voice, I could feel you next to me crossing every street, laughing at random things, but every time I looked to my side, you were nowhere to be found.

I remember going out of home with the hope to see you, it was morning the sun was high up, and on each hour that I spent exploring each corner, something died inside me, on every person I saw you, my soul went quiet each time.

I just wanted to see you, I really wanted for you to come back to me to give me a hug, I spent the whole day and night hoping on the next corner I would have my hug…it didn’t happened, and when the sun went down, the sky turn gray and the rain started to pour, for a moment I lost all hope I felt like crying, I remember watching couples with umbrellas hugging tight, I felt jealous.

We never had a closure, you told me several times that you wanted to make it work but every night you went more silent, more distant, I couldn’t hold up so much love just by myself, at the end I choose myself since you were not choosing me, it hurts even more now realizing that it was the right choice, you never really fought for us, a couple of months have passed I only got silence, I see you from time to time in my dreams, and I am ok with that, in the faces of other people and even when I talk at nights to the moon and it asks me how have you been… I can only reply that most likely you are being happy somewhere else, I really hope you are, you had such a beautiful smile, I really would do anything for that smile, even letting you go, I never was the love of your life, you demonstrated it, now… I am just happy that I met you, from all the billion stars there is, us being in the same timeline in the same place in the exact time, I was blessed.

(context) my grandpa believed that I (20m) was not my father's biological child and apparently he's been sitting on this for my entire life he was there when is was born and when he saw my eyes he was confused because as the title says I am the only one in my family who was brown eyes everyone else ether has blue or hazel.

It started drama recently when he bought and ancestry DNA kit and made me an ancestry account my parents didn't know at first but when the kit showed up at our house she got to it first. so my grandpa swearing me to secrecy was for nothing the kicker was she had an app on her phone that notified her when the kit showed up she was mad at first because grandpa had two suspects that could be my father both are dead now. so we did the kit and ancestry would notify me when is would be ready and it was do on the 24th of January we got the results and my fathers relatives showed up on ancestry meaning I am my fathers child now we probably wouldn't have to have waited so long if it was a standard paternity test but secrecy.

and the ancestry revealed that I take more from my dad then my mom even though I look like a male version her but my grandpa is still hooked on my eyes the whole reason for doing all this was because of my eyes no one else in my family has brown eyes and the ones that do are generations removed form me the only conclusion that my grandpa had come to is that it must be the 3% of native American. now he wants to do 23inme so can anyone know what's going on with my eyes also they are dark brown like coffee bean brown sometimes depending on the lighting it just looks pitch black (also my brother has blue eyes just like dads)",5,1769487149.0,DNA,3,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

In conclusion, 은는 is topic marker and 이가 is subject marker.



but you heard it a lot right?



So Let's start with 은는!



There are three cases for 은는



""First, use it for Comparison.""



For example

나는 커피를 좋아해요. 하지만 동생은 차를 좋아해요.

(I like coffee. But my sibling likes tea.)



so 나는 and 동생은 it's comparison right?



so we use 은는



""Second, for General Facts.""



For example

예문 자막: 한국은 사계절이 있어요.

(Korea has four seasons.)



so korea has four seasons is General Facts. right?



then we use 은는



""Third, for Known Topics.""



For example

예문 자막: BTS는 전 세계에서 유명해요.

(BTS is famous all over the world.)



Plus! How to distinguish 은 or 는!



If the last letter has a final consonant(받침), it comes 은

If it's not, it comes 는



Also There are three cases for 이가



""First, when introducing New Information.""



For example

(길을 가다 고양이를 발견한 상황) 와! 고양이가 있어요!

(Wow! There is a cat!)



there is a cat is new information right?



so we use 가



""Second, when emphasizing WHO did it.""



For example

A : 누가 커피 샀어요? (Who bought the coffee?)



B : 제가 샀어요! (I bought it!)



who bought it? I bought it right?



so thats why 이가 comes



""Third, to pick The One.""



For example

이 가방이 제일 예뻐요.

(This bag is the prettiest - among many.)



This bag I just picked it right? 



Then we use 이가



Plus! How to distinguish 이 or 가!



If the last letter has a final consonant(받침), it comes 이

If it's not, it comes 가



So, 

은/는: Use it for the Overall Topic (What are we talking about?).

이/가: Use it for Specific Information (Who or What specifically?).



""""Remember, if you want to emphasize the 'Story', use 은/는. 

If you want to emphasize the 'Subject', use 이/가.

That plat grind got me.



In Order of Release:

0) Watched my bf play bloodwash on january 1st 2025, I had platinumed it prior myself.

1) Golf Club Wasteland (pc) 6/10 - played this on a train from chicago on my steamdeck, it was a fun little game that some some cool vibes.

2) Assemble with Care (pc) 7/10 - Short little game about repairing sentimental treasures as you go on to travel with the main character. It's only like 2-3 hours long tops but I had a good time within it, nothing groundbreaking though.

3) The room Two (pc) 6/10 - Just a puzzle game that has some scifi vibes too it, mainly just some things to read to justifiy you doing crazy elaborate escape room/puzzle box style stuff, had a fun time trying to figure it out with my bf. 

4) The Room (pc) 6/10 - Pretty much the same as the first game in it's solid worthwhile quality of an escape room/puzzle box thing, because I played 2 with my partner after doing 1 years ago by myself, he and I went back to play the first so they would have context and I could remember some story stuff.

5) Batman Telltale Season 1 (ps4/plat) 7/10 - Played it prior on pc, but I wanted that platinum and it was years, still one of the best telltale games, though there are definitely unoffensive glitches like people contorting like demons, not spawning in for cutscenes, or people's eyes being wonky

6) Towers & Powers (psvr2/100%) 6.5/10 - Fun tower defense style game with a soft greek myth inspiration for it's world, very vibrant, a few hard levels.

7) Stranger of Paradise FF Origins (ps5/plat) 7.5/10 - Souls like but easy cuz you can do an easier difficulty then absolutely abuse the fuck out of power leveling post game. Jack is goated, chaos, limp bizkit, the like, what a weird guy.

8) Marvel Rivals (ps4/plat) 8/10 - Great, played a lot more after the plat but I'll consider it a beat game cuz I got the plat. Definitely just something I play with friends now though, cuz after you get the achievements/trophies, you lose some interest in solo.

9) Arizona Sunshine Remake (psvr2/plat) 7.5/10 - Great simple zombie shooter in vr, remade to be to the development standards of the sequel, just a fun simple time, also the easter egg with all the real life pets was adorable. Hard platinum though cuz of horde mode.

10) The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe (ps5) 7/10 - I'll consider this complete cuz the only trophy that is left after a lot of playtime is the ""leave and don't come back for 10 years"" or whatever, and I just want to actually wait that amount of time instead of just using settings to cheat it (as intended), so I essentially have the plat, so I ""beat"" it.

11) LIke a Dragon Ishin! Remake (ps5/plat) 7/10 - Good game, bad platinum. Overall I do think it feels weird for a while to play it though cuz it's a step down from a lot of modern yakuza games in it's combat feel, but I got used to it and it is a just cool game, until you need to grind the dungeons and try to do the crafting trophies, which is like 20-30 hours of ugh.

12) Resident Evil 3 Remake (ps5/plat) 7/10 - Great game but lost potential, it cut some stuff from the original resi 3 remake that would have been cool to have, and it's a really short game, but I have good memories from this experience, also the platinum wasn't long but it was a nice challenge without being overwhelming.

13) Spongebob Squarepants Battle for Bikini Bottom (ps4/plat) 6/10 - Decent collectathon game, nothing too special and the plat had some annoyances, but overall not a horrible experience. 

14) Like a Dragon Gaiden The Man Who Erased His Name (ps5/plat) 7.5/10 - It's not a game I would suggest to someone just starting the series, but it has some emotionally evocative moments that make you feel things due to your experience with kiryu and the series. Solid gameplay, really adds a decent amount of cool moves to Kiryu's arsenal. Short game too, not too long to plat relative to other yakuzas, though the end colosseum style stuff dragged a little for the plat. Must play in it's proper timeline spot for yakuza fans, made me cry.

15) Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth (ps5/plat) 8/10 - Great game, weak antagonists, packed to the brim with content, which yeah, makes the platinum a grind, but I enjoyed a lot of it. You get to see Kiryu suffer more, he only ever suffers doesn't he? Turn based like 7 (it's called 8 in japan, so of course), mainly a ichiban game but they share main character status. Definitely improves upon 7 and the plat was less difficult/grindy than 7, like no real true final millennium tower bs.

15.5) I played through multiple of the teenage mutant ninja turtles kowabunga collection games, but I don't have the plat, so I won't count that yet as a game I beat.

16) Garden of the Sea (psvr2/100%) 7/10 - A very cozy vr game that had a lot of pretty locations and cuteness factor. Also it was just fun to ride your boat out, fish a little, prep for boat trips supply wise, and just head over to another island that has a different ecosystem to the others. (and resources)

17)Final Fantasy 16 + DLC (ps5/plat/100%) 8/10 - It got a little mindless with it's side quests sometimes, some were good though ,but overall the game was epic and had some likeable characters, the main story was exceptional. The combat felt fun to play, deserved all it's success and then some. The main character was fine, no noctis or cloud, but still solid. Of course the english voice acting was great (ben starr is goated).

18) Subnautica (ps5/plat) 7/10 - A game I liked a lot more than I thought, but also a game that wasn't as scary as everyone claimed, a lot of it was tension about losing stuff, or just the large effort needed to go to the true end game depths. Overall a solid game that I could suggest to people, that wasn't the most mind blowing thing, but it was still a nice variance

19) Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (ps5/plat) 7.5/10 - Good game on ps5, heard pc is rough, fun main cast, good combat, etc, side content was pretty bad though, ant eh plat was a chore overall.

20) Vampire Survivors (ps5/plat) 9/10 - Great game to play couch co op with a friend/family member/partner, I played with my bf who I moved in with in july, easily worth it's asking price and more if you have someone to play couch co op with. Plat wasn't too bad.

20.5) I played a lot of hot shots tennis, a ps2 game or something, maybe ps1, that was streamed via ps+ premium, which I got for a few months at the end of my last refresh for like 15 bucks extra. Great fun, got 57% trophies, no plat, but the ones I was missing seemed kind of difficult above what it was worth, still fun to play. Also played a little stardew valley with my bf couch co op, we still do here and there.

21) Ratshaker (ps5/plat) (6/10) - It's a super short game that kind of outstays it's welcome if you go for the plat, but it still is a charming little diversion game that has a dark story to it.

22) Indika (ps5/plat) 6/10 (but a good 6) - A very pretty and artist forward game, albeit kind of simplistic on the moment to moment gameplay. Only really thing about plat is paying attention to collectibles and do like 2 story segment parts in one go, only one of which is frustrating. Overall I'm glad I played it with ps+ extra (upgraded from essential to premium like I said earlier), a game I'm glad I played but I couldn't see me paying full price for as it's only a few hours.

23) God of War Ragnarok + Valhalla dlc (ps5/plat/100%) 7.5/10 - Liked this a lot more than God of War 2018 as someone who prefers the original trilogy. The combat had more to it, the enemies had more variety, there were actual bosses unlike 2018, the world felt more alive and flourishing with characters (even if it's scope was small, 2018's was worse though). I felt the end of the game was rushed though, but if they had done the original trilogy idea where this was the events of what was going to be 2 games, I think it'd have been 2 mediocre games instead of 1 good game that had a disappointing final battle. The free dlc and it's trophies were fun for a bit, but eh, I mainly did it for the trophies. It had a few fun story details and character developments, but nothing you couldn't get out of a youtube vid about it. Really outside of rogue lite stuff, the only new content is story plus the boss that changes weapons

24) Synapse (psvr2/plat) 7/10 - Fun gameplay loop, though needed more to it, also I'm kind of not the biggest fan of rogue-lites (I dislike rogue-likes even more so). Overall just a fun game and the telekinesis elevated it (grabbing stuff to pull yourself down behind cover was cool too). Probably could have used more color cuz the actual gameplay levels are monochrome in contrast to the small story segments in the real world. Wish it was more of a traditional game and had more to it, but the gameplay loop was fun and had some good production value for what was there. 

25) God of War (ps3 on my ps5/plat) 7.5/10 - Another game from ps+ premium streaming, I hadn't played 1 before cuz I started god of war on 2 on the ps2 and just went on to 3 after that on the ps3 (and later ps4 as well), so while I knew stuff that happened overall, it was fun to play it. The game ages very well actually, albeit the huge majority of the game is in one temple that is kind of hard to tell exactly what you're supposed to do. Plat wasn't too bad, albeit a bit stressful of course. When I tried to do the red orb glitch, the streaming noticed I was afk without touching it for so long that it turned off and it doesn't have auto save, so had to repeat that process with more awareness. Also the speed run always has you anxious even when you're way ahead of pace.

26) God of War 2 (ps3 on my ps5/plat) 7/10 - Good to play this game that I haven't since the ps2, fun game. I do think it's not quite as memorable outside of the intro and final boss stuff as 1 though, but still an impressive game for it's time, and has aged fairly well. Plat was a fine experience as well.

27) Thank Goodness You're Here (ps5/plat) 6/10 (but a good 6) - Great game, had to play a second non blind time for the trophies but that's fine, it's a relatively short game that's got a fun sense of humor and weird world, definitely a sale game but I liked it, I played it via ps+ extra.

28) Coffee Talk (ps5/plat) 8/10 - Ps+ Extra game again, you don't really make choices besides drink orders, but giving someone the right drink at the right time can change the plot, and overall just a charming and relaxing read that takes place in a fictional seattle (I believe it was), where bigotry isn't among skin color, but fantasy races, and it delves into stuff like ignorant family members, the stress and fears of an artist as they work, shady producers taking advantage of their talent, social justice, etc. I'm hoping to play 2 at some point now that my extra is expired, but I'll prob buy it on sale instead of doing it via the service.

29) Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii (ps5/plat) 7/10 - Weak villains, I honestly don't even remember who the final villain was, but overall just a fun yakuza game. Majima was fun and the plat wasn't too bad. It got a lot of shit but it's solid, and it might be the last good yakuza game based on some choices kiwami 3 is looking to have (not story stuff, just like hiring practices and the like)

30) Sorry We're Closed (Ps5/not plat yet, but going to be one day) 10/10 - My game of the year probably of 2025, of games I played in the year and games that came out. (only real rival is unbeatable if it ever gets fixed to run well actually, that game is buggy) What a beautiful game. It has amazing art design, cunty asf character art/personalities, the gameplay is fun with it's killer 7 asf gun mechanics, the main is a pining lesbian who hasn't gotten over her ex of years ago, the main antagonist is absolutely a standout as well, etc. Just overall no notes, a great game (though plz someone make a full proper step by step guide on how to ss all the stages in speed run mode so I can get the plat without stress not playing it)

31) Batman Telltale The Enemy Within ie season 2 (ps4/plat) 7/10 - While I don't think I quite liked it as much as the first season, it definitely was bigger and was still a very fun experience. One of the better telltale games to date still.

32) PowerWash Simulator (ps5/plat and I still play it) 9/10 - I don't even know how to describe this game, it's so satisfying and fun, but also kind of a hassle drag that feels kind of boring, but at the same time I can't stop playing. I loved it and still play it cuz it's such a perfect pick up and play when you have analysis paralysis issues with the amount of games you need to play. I'm hoping to get the dlc to 100% it (only the paid dlc have trophies but I'm even doing the free ones), and I 100% plan on platinuming the sequel too (which adds couch co op lovingly)

33) Infinity Nikki (ps5/plat + working on dlc s2 trophies) 8/10 - Great game, costumes add new mechanics, heavy platforming focus as well, and just a gorgeous game with a lot of content. The plat was pretty hell to get though, it was a game I worked on in the background when not actively playing it's story for like half the year, doing the daily stuff to get the 10 iridescents and the 800 rolls on in game currency gacha. Love the game, she's iconic and can beat goku (but also might lose to a soft wind), overall very girly pop. Got the plat technically on the 15th of this month but it was a half a year in the making and I beat the campaign ages ago.

* **Chase Purdy wins at Pocono Raceway**: ARCA rookie Chase Purdy looked more like a veteran in his superspeedway start, handily winning the General Tire #AnywhereIsPossible 200 Friday afternoon at Pocono Raceway. Burton, in the No. 8 Bama Buggies Chevy, drove away from Harrison Burton over the final 10 laps to earn his second career ARCA victory in his fifth series start. ""That was awesome,"" said Purdy. ""This win is for John Andretti. Their family is going through a lot right now. He's the toughest guy on the planet. If anyone can do it, he can."" Purdy struggled in the open test Wednesday, had a mechanical issue in practice Friday, but put it all together in time to go to Victory Lane. ""I didn't get much sleep last night, but it was all worth it. All that matters is family in this world and I got a great one behind me. This is so cool."" (06-01-18)
* **Chandler Smith scores win at Michigan:** It wasn't exactly a barn burner, but for Chandler Smith, in search of his ARCA Racing Series  victory, it must have looked like the ""promise land"" out the front windshield of his No. 20 Toyota.

In the end, Chandler Smith pulled away from runner-up finisher Chase Purdy to win the 37th running of the ZOMONGO 200 Friday afternoon at Michigan Int'l Speedway.

Gilliland dropped to the tail of the lead lap with loose right side wheels. As Gilliland was slowing with those wheel issues on lap 37, Bobby Gerhart. spun in turn four to put the field under the third caution of the evening, which allowed Gilliland to pit and stay on the lead lap. Smith made an unscheduled stop under caution on lap 39, and when the green waved three laps later he restarted 13th. Todd Gilliland quickly worked his way back up into the top five. By the halfway mark, he had moved back into third behind Joe Graf Jr. and Harrison Burton, both of whom looked like they could potentially be the car to beat. But by lap 126, Gilliland dipped to the lowside on a restart and moved into the lead, a lead he wouldn't relinquish. (06-18-18)

it was something nice he kept asking me if I needed something from the store. 

for context; we planned on hanging out. he suggested a bar near my place and his job. I turned it down because I'm in a wheelchair, bars and wheelchairs don't blend well . People are drinking, it's dark, and loud ect. he suggested a coffee shop again I said not feeling the coffee shop at the time I was sick and was craving a fruit bowl from the grocery store. anyway we ended up not going I was sick 🤢 and he also wasn't feeling well. 

the thing is after I said that I wanted to go to the grocery store he thought I needed groceries.

this drove me to tears why you ask because he was kind. and I felt some sort of way almost undeserving. 

the reason I need advice is because I don't want to make a mistake by running to the first person who shows me a little kindness. I don't know if I'm being too cautious or if I'm being just cautious enough to protect my self

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Chapter 1





""You're worthless!""





David threw his fork down so hard it clattered against his plate.





""You sit on your ass all day while I'm out there busting mine, and you've got the nerve to give me attitude?""





""I make twenty thousand a month. And every dime goes into keeping this roof over your head."" He jabbed a finger at me.





""What do you contribute? Nothing!""





I kept silent. Set my fork down slowly.





""What's the matter? Finally realize I'm right?"" David's lip curled.





I looked up at him. Smiled.





""Yeah. You're right.""





I stood.





""Well then. Let's get divorced.""





David's face went blank.





He hadn't seen that coming.





Neither had I, honestly.





But well, this is gonna be FUN.





...





""What did you just say?"" My MIL Linda's voice went shrill.





""Divorce."" I pushed my chair back. ""Since I'm such a waste of space, we should end this.""





David found his voice. ""You think I won't? You think I need you?""





""Prove it.""





Silence dropped over the room like a wet blanket.





Linda recovered first. ""Honey, he's just venting. You can't possibly be serious—""





""He said it. I'm just agreeing with him."" I said flatly.





""My son works himself to death while you do nothing!"" Her voice climbed higher. ""He's allowed to be frustrated!""





I didn't answer. Just walked toward the bedroom.





""Where are you going?"" David followed.





""To pack.""





""You're really doing this?""





I pulled my suitcase from the closet. ""Isn't this what you want? To find someone who actually has their life together?""





His face went through about six different colors.





Three years. That's how long he'd been doing this.





Useless. Lazy. Dead weight. Biggest mistake he ever made.





Every word carved into my memory.





""You asked me to quit."" I started throwing clothes in the bag.





""What?"" He went still.





""Two years ago. You said work was killing you, and someone needed to handle things at home. You begged me to quit. Said we'd figure it out later.""





More clothes. Faster now.





""So I did. And the second I didn't have a paycheck, I became worthless to you.""





""That's not—I never—""





""Never what?"" I spun around. ""Never meant it? Because you've said it about a hundred times.""





He opened his mouth. Nothing came out.





Linda appeared in the doorway.





""This is ridiculous. It's the middle of the night, everyone's tired—""





I zipped the suitcase. ""I'm done. Three years of listening to him tell me how much he regrets marrying me. Well, congratulations—problem solved.""





I wheeled the suitcase past her.





David grabbed the handle. ""Where are you even going?""





""Somewhere else.""





""You don't have anyone. No family, no job, no money."" His voice cracked slightly. ""You think you can just—what, survive on your own?""





I met his eyes. ""Watch me.""





""You can't.""





I pulled the suitcase free and walked into the elevator.





The doors started to close. David stood frozen in the hallway, his expression cycling through anger, confusion, and something that might've been panic.





I leaned against the wall and pulled out my phone.





One image filled the screen.





A property deed. Entirely in my name.





I stared at it, that small smile tugging at my lips again.





Oh, David.





You have no idea what's about to hit you.





Chapter 2





I checked into a hotel that night.





The next morning, my phone lit up. David.





I let it ring.





He called five more times. I ignored every single one.





On the sixth, I answered.





""Where the hell are you?!""





""Hotel.""





""Come home. We need to talk.""





""No, we don't.""





""Susan!"" His voice cracked with frustration. ""Would you stop acting like a child?""





""I'm not acting like anything."" My voice was ice. ""You wanted a divorce. I'm giving you one.""





Dead air.





""I didn't—look, I was just talking! Why are you making this a whole thing?!""





""You've been just talking for three years, David.""





""Okay, fine—I'm sorry, alright? Can we just drop this?""





""No.""





I hung up.





The phone buzzed again immediately. Different number.





""Hello, is this Susan Parker?""





""Speaking.""





""Hi, this is Riverside Property Management. Your tenant in unit 302 says the AC's busted. Any chance you could swing by?""





""This afternoon work?""





""Perfect. Thanks.""





I ended the call and stared at David's name still flashing on my screen.





He had no idea that call just happened.





No idea I owned property.





SEVEN properties, actually.





My parents made sure of that before they died.





The night before their car accident, my mom grabbed my hand, her grip almost painful.





""Susie, listen to me. Don't tell anyone about these properties.""





""Why?""





""Money changes people."" Her eyes were hard. ""Even your husband. Especially your husband.""





I thought she was being paranoid.





Turns out, she was just being smart.





If David knew I owned seven rental properties pulling in a hundred and twenty grand a month—





Would he still call me worthless?





Hell no.





He'd just call me his personal ATM.





I grabbed my bag and checked out.





...





That afternoon, I stood on the balcony of unit 302, watching the city stretch out below me.





Seven properties scattered across town.





Three commercial spaces at twenty thousand each. Four residential units at fifteen.





One hundred and twenty thousand dollars. Every MONTH.





David thought I was broke. Desperate. Totally dependent on his mediocre salary.





His twenty-thousand-dollar paycheck didn't even cover the rent on one of my commercial spaces.





What a fucking idiot.





My phone buzzed. David. Again.





""What do you want from me?"" His voice was raw with anger now. ""Seriously, what's your endgame here?""





""I told you. Divorce.""





""Over what? Because I said a few things I didn't mean? I was trying to motivate you!""





There it was. The excuse I'd heard a thousand times.





""I'm pushing you to be better!""





""I'm helping you grow!""





""This is tough love!""





Blah, blah, blah.





""Motivate me?"" My voice went cold. ""Which part was motivating, exactly? When you called me a waste of space? Or when you said marrying me was your biggest mistake?""





Silence.





His breathing came fast and ragged through the phone.





""You're twisting my words! Whatever.""





His tone shifted—harder now, meaner.





""You want a divorce? Fine. But you're leaving with nothing.""





I went still.





""The house is mine. The car's mine. Every penny in our account is mine.""





His voice dripped with satisfaction. ""You walk away, you walk away empty-handed. That's the deal.""





He thought he'd cornered me. Thought I'd panic. Beg. Crawl back.





""Okay.""





""What?""





""I said okay."" My voice didn't waver. ""I'll leave with nothing.""





""You're—wait, are you serious?""





""Dead serious.""





""Then..."" He fumbled. ""Then you'll sign the papers.""





""When?""





""Tomorrow. No—today. This afternoon.""





""Fine.""





I hung up before he could say another word.





Stood there staring out at the traffic below, at the life I'd built that he knew nothing about.





David.





You think you just won?





You think I'm scared? Helpless? Trapped?





You think I desperately need you?





But... the person about to lose everything...





That's YOU.





Chapter 3





Three o'clock sharp. I walked back through the door.





David was sprawled on the couch.





Linda sat beside him, arms crossed, radiating smugness.





On the coffee table between them: divorce papers.





""Sign."" David didn't even look at me as he slid the pen across.





I picked up the agreement.





Property to husband. Vehicle to husband. Savings to husband.





""Works for me."" I reached for the pen.





Linda let out a harsh laugh. ""Knew she didn't have the guts to fight.""





David's mouth curved into a satisfied smirk.





They thought they'd broken me.





I set the pen down.





""Quick question.""





His smirk faltered. ""Now what?""





""This house."" I tapped the paper. ""It's in your name, right?""





""What the hell kind of question—yes, IT'S in my name!""





""Mind if I see the deed?""





His jaw tightened, but he stood and yanked it from a drawer.





I gave it a quick scan.





Yep. David C. Sole owner.





He'd made the down payment. Been paying the mortgage for five years.





""Okay. Just wanted to confirm.""





""Great. So sign—""





""One more thing.""





A vein pulsed in his temple. ""What?""





""This is your only property, right?""





He frowned. ""Why would you ask me that?""





""Just covering my bases."" I held his stare. ""You're absolutely sure there's nothing else registered under your name?""





""What are you trying to—""





The doorbell cut him off.





Linda moved to answer it, muttering under her breath.





""David C here?"" Female voice. Young. Cocky.





I looked toward the door.





A woman stepped inside. Late twenties, head to toe in designer labels. Hair and makeup like she'd just stepped off a photoshoot. And that bag on her arm—





Hermès. Birkin, if I wasn't mistaken.





Fifteen thousand dollars.





I'd seen the charge on David's credit card statement two months ago.





""Who the hell are you?"" Linda's voice went shrill.





The woman ignored her completely, walked straight past, and locked eyes with David.





""You said you'd have an answer for me today.""





Every drop of color drained from David's face.





""What are you—why are you here?""





""Because I'm done waiting."" She flicked her gaze toward me, barely interested. ""So this is the wife?""





I looked at her. Then at David.





""You gonna introduce us, or should I guess?""





Sweat beaded on his forehead.





Linda stood frozen, mouth half-open.





The woman smiled. ""Since he's too chickenshit to say it, I will. Amy L. David's girlfriend.""





The room went dead silent.





Linda's face turned ashen.





David looked like he might throw up.





I turned back to Amy.





""Girlfriend.""





""Yeah."" She ran her fingers through her perfectly styled hair. ""We've been together a year. He promised he'd divorce you after New Year's. Guess he forgot to mention that part?""





I slowly shifted my gaze back to David.





He couldn't even meet my eyes.





""A year,"" I said quietly.





Amy nodded, clearly enjoying herself. ""Mm-hmm. Met at the office last March. Took him three months to wear me down, but he was very persistent.""





Something clicked.





Last March.





That's when the insults started getting vicious.





""What do you even contribute?""





""The women at my office—smart, driven, actually take care of themselves.""





""All you do is lie around eating my food and spending my money.""





It all made sense now.





He wasn't trying to motivate me.





He was trying to justify himself.





""David."" Amy moved closer, sliding her arm through his possessively. ""You told me she already agreed to this. So why hasn't she signed?""





David finally managed to speak. ""Amy, just—go wait outside for a second—""





""No."" Her grip tightened. ""I've waited long enough. I want to watch her sign.""





I stared at them.





My husband and his mistress. Arms linked. Standing in front of me.





Linda still hadn't moved. Her expression was twisted with disgust, but didn't say anything.





I picked up the agreement again.





""Well?"" Amy's voice had an edge now. ""Get on with it.""





I looked at her.





And smiled.





""You seem stressed.""





""I've been patient for a year!"" She rolled her eyes dramatically. ""So yeah, let's move this along.""





""A year."" I nodded thoughtfully. ""Do you know how much he's spent on you during that time?""





Amy's expression flickered.





I pulled out my phone and opened a folder I'd been building for months.





""January. Three thousand dollars. February. Five thousand. March—oh, that was a big month. Fifteen grand for that bag you're wearing.""





I read each line slowly, deliberately.





Amy's face started to change.





""April. Eight thousand. May. Six thousand. June—two thousand for hotel rooms, nice touch.""





""Stop!"" David lunged forward.





I looked up. Met his eyes.





""No.""





My smile widened.





""I'm not done yet.""

From memory we were reminiscing about the toy...anyway, things escalated and someone threw a block (about 1.5"" cubed) at the other (playfully), but then that escalated to us lobbing these toy blocks (of varied shape) at each other and ducking behind the lounge pillows etc....these blocks (about 100 of them) went all over the lounge room   
  
My sister had the shits with me at this point....so I got up and left to go to the bathroom. I came back into the lounge room literally 30 seconds later, and ALL of the blocks were piled up on top of each other in towers in the middle of the room.

I asked my sister ""WTF""....and she just smiled and indicated that she just pointed to them and was able to clean them up by pointing only.

""The orange fellows are doing their business again,"" Dennis says at the window, and Claire writes it down. October 14th, 4:30pm. The orange fellows. He means the leaves. Or possibly the light through the leaves. It doesn't matter.

She's smiling as she writes. She catches herself and stops, but her face wants to keep doing it.

""They're very busy today,"" he adds, pleased with himself, and she writes that too.

For forty-one years he spoke in complete, cutting sentences. He was a litigator. He could parse a contract until it confessed. At dinner parties he would correct her stories—not the facts, the structure. ""What Claire means to say is."" She'd stopped telling stories by their twentieth anniversary.

Now he says things like ""the orange fellows"" and waits for her to be delighted.

And she is. God help her, she is.

The notebook is nearly full. She started it eight months ago, after the diagnosis, thinking it would be—what? Documentation for the doctor? A record for their daughter? But Melissa lives in Singapore and calls every Sunday with the strained cheer of someone performing empathy across a bad connection. Claire hasn't shown her the notebook. She won't.

Dennis leaves the window and sits across from her. He's wearing his cardigan inside-out. She noticed this morning and said nothing. He looks softer this way, the seams showing.

""What are you writing?"" he asks.

""Just a list,"" she says.

""Are we on it?""

""Yes.""

""Good."" He nods. ""That's good, then.""

This is new, this agreeableness. Before, he would have needed to know what kind of list, what it was for, whether she was doing it correctly. He once spent an entire weekend reorganizing her recipe box by cuisine and preparation time. She'd filed them by how often she made them, by which ones the kids liked. He'd called her system ""emotional"" like it was a diagnosis.

She'd found the recipes in the recycling six months later. He'd decided they should eat more simply. He hadn't asked.

""I'm going to check on something,"" Dennis says, standing. This is what he says now instead of explaining where he's going. She's learned it means the bathroom, or the bedroom, or sometimes just the hallway, where he'll stand looking at the photographs like they're an exhibit he's touring.

When he's gone, she pages back through the notebook.

\*September 3rd: ""I've lost my shoe agenda."" (His daily planner)\*

\*September 10th: ""The singing box won't stop knowing about the weather."" (Radio)\*

\*September 18th: ""Claire, the small night is here."" (Evening, dusk)\*

That last one had made her breath catch. The small night. It was beautiful. Dennis had never said anything beautiful, not in four decades. He'd said accurate things. Logical things. He'd said ""I love you"" on schedule—birthdays, anniversaries, when one of them left for a trip.

She'd said it back the same way. A contract renewed.

There's a crash from the bedroom. She doesn't jump up. She's learned to wait, to let him solve what he can solve. The crashes are usually minor—a book, a drawer pulled too far. Once, a lamp, but he'd seemed proud of the pieces, arranging them on the dresser like a collection.

He appears in the doorway. ""There's a situation,"" he says. ""But I've managed it.""

""Thank you,"" she says.

He beams.

This is the worst part, how grateful he is for her patience. The old Dennis took her patience as his due. Took everything as his due. He'd retired early, sixty-two, and spent three years telling her how to load the dishwasher more efficiently, how to drive, how to arrange her own day. She'd started volunteering at the library just to have somewhere he couldn't follow, couldn't optimize.

Then the forgetting started. Just names at first. Then protocols. Then the difference between correction and cruelty, which maybe he'd never known.

Now he follows her room to room not to supervise but because he feels safer when she's visible. He'll stand in the kitchen while she cooks, offering observations. ""That smells like warm,"" he said yesterday. She'd written it down, hating herself, loving him.

Her sister Karen thinks she's a saint. ""I don't know how you do it,"" she says on the phone, and Claire makes appropriate noises about vows and duty. Karen's husband brings her coffee in bed every morning, has for thirty years. They have in-jokes. They touch each other in passing.

Claire and Dennis had separate bathrooms. Separate hobbies. Separate friends, mostly. A shared daughter, a shared mortgage, a shared understanding that this was what marriage became: a well-run household and no surprises.

""Claire?"" Dennis is standing very close now. She didn't hear him approach. ""Are you sad?""

""No,"" she says. ""I'm okay.""

""Okay is good,"" he says. ""Okay is the best one.""

He used to hate that word. ""Don't be imprecise,"" he'd say when she'd answer ""How are you?"" with ""okay."" He'd wait for her to quantify, to give him something he could measure.

She reaches up and touches his face. He leans into her hand like a cat, unselfconscious. The old Dennis would have asked what she was doing, if something was wrong, if she needed something from him.

This Dennis just accepts the touch as a good thing happening.

She pulls her hand back and he wanders away again, humming tunelessly.

The notebook sits open on the table. She should close it. She should throw it away. It's evidence of something terrible about herself—that she's only capable of loving someone when they can't challenge her, contradict her, correct her. That she needs him diminished to find him dear.

But she picks up the pen instead.

\*October 14th, 4:47pm: ""Okay is the best one.""\*

Her handwriting looks eager. She can see it in the slant of the letters, the way she's pressed into the paper. This is what love looks like for her, apparently. Relief in cursive.

Dennis comes back wearing his cardigan right-side-out now. He must have figured it out, or gotten warm, or simply changed his mind in the way he does now, without explanation or announcement.

""I fixed myself,"" he says, proud.

""I see that. Good job.""

""Will you come look at the orange fellows with me?""

She should start dinner. She should call Melissa back—there was a voicemail this morning she hasn't checked. She should do any number of things that the old Claire would have done while the old Dennis read the paper and made observations about municipal bond rates.

""Yes,"" she says.

They stand at the window together. The maple in the backyard is losing its leaves in the wind, and yes, they do look busy, the way they swirl and scatter.

""They're going somewhere,"" Dennis says.

""Where do you think?""

""Down,"" he says, considering it carefully. ""They're going down. But happy about it.""

She writes it in her mind to transfer later: \*happy about it.\*

His hand finds hers between them. His grip is loose, uncertain. The old Dennis had a firm handshake, a confident touch. This Dennis holds her hand like he's asking a question.

She squeezes back gently.

They watch the orange fellows together, going down, happy about it, and Claire feels something huge and terrible in her chest. It might be love. It might be grief. It might be the awful knowledge that she has only ever been able to love what couldn't overwhelm her, and that makes her smaller than she'd believed herself to be.

Dennis leans his head on her shoulder. He smells like the same soap he's used for years, but he feels different. Lighter. Like he's already half-gone into wherever he's going.

""This is nice,"" he says.

""Yes,"" she agrees.

And it is. That's the thing she'll never be able to explain to Karen, to Melissa, to anyone. It is nice. It's the nicest her marriage has ever been.

She'll write that down later, after he's asleep. She'll write it and hate herself and keep the notebook anyway, because it's the only place she can tell the truth: that she's never been happier than she is now, watching everything fall apart, finally able to love what's left.",1,1769485344.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Not a coffee expert here. Only started Aeropressing last year. I predominantly drink Black or Flat White simply. So I bought a Joepresso few months back. Writing this post because I almost gave up and wanted to throw the Joepresso away.

Tip 1: do not grind too fine. water flow can get stuck

Tip 2: start with 14grams. doing 17-18grams = water flow can get stuck

Tip 3: Tamp lightly or do not tamp, it is fine. I tamp with my finger. Haha

not a Tip: you can pour in hot water second round after your espresso shot to get ""filtered coffee"" not strong but decent taste. Not wasting coffee flavour = save the Earth?

Nothing deep knowledge but silly mistakes that caused me to need to press the aeropress super duper hard to squeeze out the coffee and check a few videos but still could not figure out. Joepresso info is not that many.",0,1769485097.0,AeroPress,1,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qo2iwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1qo2iwn/bellwether_shop_roaster_experiencereview/,Bellwether Shop Roaster Experience/Review,"Seriously considering purchasing a shop roaster Bellwether for my very small coffee roaster/shop. Let me give context.

I have been in the coffee industry for roughly 13 years. I love coffee and am very passionate about serving coffee to the best of my ability. Valuing high quality experience of customer interaction and high quality coffee. I have been roasting for about 3-4ish years, starting with a .5 kilo propane drum roaster. I started my cottage food law coffee roasting business at a farmers market at a midwestern small city with initial success. After my first year, I purchased a used 2010 2 kilo propane drum roaster. With a little TLC and dialing it in, loved the results I was getting. Started my 2nd year at the farmers market with a lot more success than the first year and by the end of the year, I was able to set myself up in a small (76 sq. feet small) walk up window in a great part of the city. 

I have a solid customer base who are excited and are wanting the coffee we produce. At this point, I am at a cross roads. I am stuck between the point of trying to move my roasting facility into a commercially approved facility and compliance (local and state regulations). In the meantime, I am using a local coffee roaster, solid coffee, but feeling as if I am not living up to my business model.

**So here are my thoughts**

1. I am currently quoted around $7,000 to ventilate my current coffee roaster. To me it's a lot and I already owe so much in my current build out of my walk up window.

2. I am feeling the pressure of needing to be able to provide my coffee for my current customers (they frequently ask for bags of coffee) and I feel like I'm letting them down.

3. With the restriction of my current space being so small, the idea of a ""plug and play"" type roaster is extremely attractive to me.

4. I'm not opposed to financing a machine of $22,000+ if I see that it will be worthwhile with wholesale and savings on my bar's end (instead of purchasing multiple 5 lbs bags at a time). I am aware that making it worth my while is on my end, I guess I'd like to hear others experience in taking that leap of faith with a machine and lined up accounts.

**What I am wanting to hear feedback on**

1. I know of a local roaster who purchased what I believe is to be the series 1 from Bellwether and no longer use it due to technical issues and lack of support. I have an aversion to using newer coffee technology if there is a lack of support (bad experience with a slayer V1 in my first specialty coffee shop). With that to say, do the newer models have the issues worked out? Is support actually supportive or responsive in assistance when needing it soon-ish?

2. How are the results when it comes to the overall quality of coffee? That is of utmost importance to me and I don't want to sacrifice quality for efficiency. I am wanting and willing to upload my own profiles.

3. With electric technology, my thoughts are the technology is not quick in it's response. I feel like it will take several seconds to acclimate to my adjustments. We all know with coffee roasting, seconds matter  in responsiveness.

1qo2ebm,https://i.redd.it/kzphrad49tfg1.jpeg,"Oily beans, that are fresh","So, I just purchased two pounds of a dark roast while I was visiting in San Francisco. This roaster is pretty popular, and claims to be the oldest coffee roaster in the city

I really like their no nonsense menu. Which is light roast, dark roast, and decaf. I just love the simplicity of “we keep it simple, this is all we have”. The guy who sold them to me said they were roasted the day before. The beans are crazy oily, and also very VERY dark. Like darkest I’ve ever had. I have heard that darker roasts can sometimes be oily but still good and or fresh

Is this anything to worry about? Other than maybe having to clean my grinder out more frequently? I always assumed oily meant not good in one way or another. Like the oils have made their way to the outside of the beans suggesting they’re old. I dialed them in and pulled 4 shots to get me close so I can enjoy my coffee tomorrow morning. It tasted ok, robust and deep as hell, that’s for sure. Like the final boss of dark roast. But I have two pounds of it, so I’d like to drink it. Someone who’s smarter than me explain why “fresh” beans are THAT oily

The one thing that's been really obnoxious about the experience,  though,  is that our  LC (who is a replacement after our first one had to move away) says we are contractually obligated to take our kid to one meet-up a month. It's always nearly an hour away,  boring,  and a pain to get him to go. He has a ton of friends, and he and my son formed a band and they live a very busy and social life. In s couple of weeks he's supposed to go to this thing with ISE that starts at 7 am on a Saturday morning an hour away from our house.  

I totally get that these kids SHOULD be checked on and seen by the organization. I'm all for that.  But this planning is ridiculous. She even said that going forward they will have to miss extracurricular school activities if it's the same as her scheduled meet-ups. These days are different from the ones our original coordinator planned,  and the activities are just not enticing.  The first coordinator planned trips to nearby cities and the football stadium every other month,  with less time-intensive activities between.

New here—I’ll fill in the details on my situation and hoping for insights. Started low dose aspirin last May after PFO closure surgery. Always felt fine until over the holidays I ate poorly and drank a lot (esp New Year’s). Couple days after, started gnawing stomach discomfort, bloating, and gas that feels better with food.

Fearing an ulcer, I took Prilosec 20mg every morning for 2 weeks. Felt basically healed by end of week 1, but discomfort came back week 2. Not restarting PPIs till doctor appt, but can’t stop baby aspirin for clotting reasons. Wondering how my stomach can heal itself?

Also did stomach acid test: for 2 days, morning after baking soda (1/4 tsp in water), no burp for 7 min—makes me think low stomach acid? Coffee is the WORST trigger, but green tea and chamomile seem to soothe. Milk also upsets.

Any similar stories with aspirin? How to protect stomach on low-dose ASA? PPI rebound or truly low acid? Safe ways to boost acid/heal lining while on aspirin?

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

•I had a good professional career

• Relationship started 2010

• Quit my job and moved 8hrs drive to live with him in smaller town

•Struggled to find work settled for low paying jobs

•When pregnant I encouraged him to ask to buy into company and be a partner at work, as we would have one income

• Two Kids (Had 1 child, married, had 2nd Child, both currently in primary school from 9-2.30pm weekdays)

• I always worked part time when pregnant or returned once each baby was 6m old (I like to and want to work)

• He was offered partnership which I contributed capital for, which meant his hours and workload increased (he only worked  3-4 days prev) , so I did EVERYTHING at home to support him in that as I saw it as a long term, team effort investment.

• At tax his income was distributed to me  ( on paper) to reduce tax, so he liked it when I dont work or only get 20-40k/yr

• He struggles with relationships/parenting/work used to get mad at me because he worked

• after years of arguing, due to his emotional avoidance and manipulation  I left in 2021, but struggled to find a place and would have to move away with kids as too expensive in his town, so he bought a house in the town and pays the mortgage and utilities, I spend all my pay on food and keeping the car running an4d the kids. I dont go anywhere or pay for social stuff, dont drink, dont smoke, even quite coffee to save money.

• Because hes been a slow learner with parenting at first he had kids 1 weekend a fortnight, and thats gradually increased, and we are just about to start 50/50 7days Sunday-sun shared care

• Part of the reason I seperated is because he is avoidant and separating would mean he has to spend time with the kids while they are young. Work wise he can do that now becuase he is higher up and can hire staff, so he schedules his work around having the kids.

• we have not officially divorced because he says it looks better on paper if he needs to apply for a loan or for tax purposes. So I just go along with that.

• It's great that he pays the mortgage and utilities (but also the funds come from a dividend that I helped raise capital for and instigated) but I want to become indpenedant, most of all because hes a bit of a psychological terrorist so he holds me to ransom about living in the house and anything to do with money, and I would like to talk to him as little as possible, so I would like to be more independant

• However Im finding that now I want to prioritise my career to do so, he is sabotaging my efforts a little, but most of all I cant find a job where I can work school hours one week and then full time or 24/7 the week I dont have the kids

• The way things are setup up seem to have really benefited him, because now he has the kids (at a time of life they can feed themselves and be left home alone for 20mins if needed) and his work is set up to accommodate this because we prioritised it, and Im trying to sort out a career for me but I dont have a babysitter/maid at home like he did.

• Now we are going 50/50 with the kids, I want a real job (career) but Im worried Im going to have to stick with cleaning and gig style jobs because I only have a bachelor's (psych) that I have not used yet, and employers seem to want people who can work 9-5 and devote themselves to the job which I can only do 1 out of 2 weeks.

• Im in my 40s so  I want to get established in a less physical role than cleaning in my older years. So I planned to work in lower level professional 9-5 roles starting this year so Im set up to have a less physical but also a higher professional role in 5-10 years time, but I also dont have a partner, so someone has to be home with the kids.

Also living in this town really doesnt have much on offer work wise. 

I cant be a cleaner until Im 70, so I need a plan or something support to make a change.

**TLDR I want to divorce and be fully independant but how can I if I have kids and my work options are constrained?** 

Should I bring anything up about the diviidends? 

I dont really want the house or anything, I just want autonomy, and to be there for my kids on the days I have them. 

**Does divorce take into account the setback a primary carer faces long term?** 

How do I go about this? 

Am I being screwed because hes kept me on a low income wage so he gets a tax break? 

or should I shut up and live like this for another 8-10years and then just walk away? 

He's used me as a maid and a babysitter and Im the default parent. To the point Im highly anxious because even when he has the kids he still calls up and says I have to take them if theyvare sick etc, so I also find it hard to commit to a job because he puts a lot of surprise problems on me. 

But I feel like as the kids get more self sufficient, he will have less of a need for me and I could be kicked to the curb at anytime.

Black-Hole Smuggling Payloads – The Payloads That ""Disappear"" Until They Don't

Zero-width joiner (ZWJ/ZWNJ) runs threaded through periods, spaces, or graphemes → survive NFC/NFD folding, whitespace collapse, entity encoding, token splitters. They look like formatting noise early, but fork token boundaries or defer parsing in preview vs. index vs. render vs. accessibility/OCR/export.

Variable-width whitespace chains (1–32+ spaces/tabs/NBSP/homoglyph spaces) → exploit inconsistent collapse across layers.

Buried control chars + direction overrides + homoglyphs → hide until late render or LLM token buffer.

These primitives survive what should kill them, then activate only in deferred hell (preview re-render, background indexing, cloud OCR, agent memory reload). Real bounties in 2025 showed Trix/Basecamp editors, Grafana plugins, and LLM chats still choking on variants.

Human-Speed Stall/Churn – The Killer Rhythm That Stresses Races Without Tripping Alarms

Jitter everything: 50–500ms random delays between cut → paste → toggle → repeat. Mimic a slow typer editing furiously.

Churn sequences: Copy snippet → wait jitter → paste → wait → cut → repeat with tiny variations → force DOM thrash, preview races, queue buildup, moderation gaps.

Tie to real events only (paste after copy, dark mode flip, sync trigger) — never poll or loop.

Result: Elastic rebound windows open (latency spikes become your cover). Deferred phases overlap/race, amplifying forks into leaks, injections, or escalations. Behavioral analytics? ""Just a user being annoying in Notion."" WAF? ""Low-entropy human paste rhythm.""

The Deferred Consumption-as-Execution Graveyard – Where It All Blows Up

Rich-text editors (contentEditable, Trix v2+, CKEditor embeds) → paste survives ingest, forks in preview vs. final storage vs. export.

Chat/comment/preview systems (Slack threads, Discord, X replies) → emoji/ZWJ smuggling + deferred index/render/accessibility.

Cloud collab/indexing (Drive/Notion/Figma thumbnails, OCR on uploads) → normalization at ingest vs. deferred thumbnail/OCR/ sync execution.

Clipboard/autofill chains → copy desync → paste overrides locks.

LLM/agentic surfaces (Cursor, Claude, enterprise copilots) → prompt smuggling survives sanitizers → deferred token buffer/tool-calling reasoning → config poison or RCE gadget.

Fork magic: Validation sees safe text → deferred phase treats it as code/command/instruction. Recent 2025 bounties (Trix stored XSS via paste, Grafana chained open-redirect + stored XSS to SSRF) prove these phases are still wide open.

LOTL Discipline – Why It Survives EDR/UEBA/Moderation in 2026

Zero custom code/binaries — all actions are native browser/app features (copy/paste, mode toggles).

Incremental/reversible: One primitive per session, revert on resistance.

Resistance gating: Latency spike? 4xx? WAF hint? Pause days, pivot surface.

Ethical lockdown: Bounty scope only, passive observe first, report with ""phase isolate early, canonicalize strictly, guard deferred outputs.""

The Choke-on-Coffee Reality Check

In 2026, AI agents live in editors/IDEs/CRMs with tool-calling and persistent memory. Deferred phases (preview → index → render → tool invoke → config reload) are everywhere. Your black-hole primitives + stall/churn rhythm can smuggle payloads that sit dormant (Sleeping Angel), ride elastic snap-backs (Rubber Band War), and fork meaning across layers (Fox Spirit ambiguity). Flip to black-hat intent? Quiet spyware in previews, config-poisoning ransomware activating on sync, worms propagating via shared docs. Defenses mitigate a lot... but not all. The physics still allow it.

This is conceptual/research-only — no payloads, no repro steps, no runnable script. It's a warning: Modern pipelines still have sally ports where early sanitization fails late. If you're hunting bounties, map these forks passively first. If you're defending, kill deferred ambiguity with ruthless phase isolation.

I don't understand. Can someone explain?,"Somebody mentioned in another thread that one of the reasons it would take a miracle for him to meet anyone is because he doesn't drink, and I just read a thread on a dating site discussion board where people said one of the things that causes them to NOT message a person is if they don't drink.

Awhile ago a man sent me this message: ""Interesting to find someone else like me, who doesn't drink. My friends told me to state in my profile that I'm a casual drinker, to increase my chances, so that's what I did""

I refuse to lie about anything on my profile. I don't drink (never have except for tasting beer and wine once as a teen) because I don't like the taste and smell and don't want/need any substances affecting my brain. That's all.

It never occurred to me that it might conjure up various other things in people's minds.

Are people put off because they think you're ""no fun""?

Or do they suspect you're an alcoholic and thus can't/don't drink?

Like when I started a new job and the manager asked if I wanted tea or coffee. I said ""No thank you, I'll just have water"". She looked at me strangely and said ""Ohhh, are you religious?"" Huh? Nope. I just don't like tea or coffee. 

Most people think it's odd. ""Well what on earth do you drink then?""

Non-drinkers, what has been your OLD experience?

Drinkers, do you message or date non-drinkers?

Also, any other vegetarians out there who state this on your profile?

My name’s Kaitlyn and I’m an incoming UNC Chapel Hill freshman (Class of 2030). I’m looking for a female roommate to share a suite-style dorm on campus. I’m a first-generation student, so everything about college is really exciting for me, and I’d love to find someone fun to share the experience with.

A little about me. I’m 18, majoring in Biology with a pre-med track and planning to minor in Dance/ Exercise Science. I’d say I’m pretty chill and laid-back. I’m definitely social most of the time. Some things I enjoy are dance, hiking, hanging out with friends, drinking coffee, and yes, I still play Roblox.

For housing, I’m hoping for a double room in a suite of eight, ideally on mid-campus or south campus, I’m open to any suite-style dorms. I like to keep my space moderate to clean, and I usually do my studying in the library or outside the dorm, not really in the room. I’m flexible about sleep schedules, guests, noise, and temperature. I don’t mind sharing things like snacks, fridge space, or clothes, and I like a friendly, easygoing roommate vibe.

If this sounds like it could be a good fit, the best way to reach me is by Reddit DM. I’m happy to share my Instagram or phone number after we’ve chatted a bit. I can’t wait to meet someone fun, chill, and easygoing to share a suite with.",2,1769483126.0,UNC,0,1.0,False

Thought about it awhile…what the hell is that scent?? I know it from somewhere! Then it hits, ah yes, my old pal Pink Suede. Of the many scents I’ve tried, Pink Suede has always stood out like no other and lasted like no other and brought compliments like no other. 

If you long for Pink Suede, I would say that Khamrah Qahwa is \*pretty\* similar. The only big difference I notice is that Qahwa is missing that super juicy fruity note that Pink Suede has, perhaps from the blush berries. Qahwa is hardly sweet, but reminds me of a more toned-down, unisex version of Pink Suede. Which is good enough in my book. 

I tried the body cream and Qahwa together, since I sadly ran out of the body mist. Nothing spectacular as they’re so similar in scent, but the spicy notes of Qahwa balance out the juicyness of Suede. Still a very great combo!!",5,1769483116.0,bathandbodyworks,2,1.0,False

So there's this coworker (I'll just dub B) who I've personally never liked, our personalities just clash and she does a bunch of stuff that annoys me on a personal level.

But I've never let those personal feelings turn me into a rude person. I treated her cordially like I would any other coworker, if I was doing the coffee run and she was in the vicinity I'd offer to get her some too, if she talked to me I made polite conversation. 

Well one day out of the blue she suddenly started acting extremely rude to me. Even started spreading rumors too. I ignored it. It was annoying yes but it didn't affect my work and my coworkers treated me the same. 

Yesterday a coworker pulled me aside to talk privately. I found out why B was being so petty. 

Whenever I need to rant I text my sister. We rant back and forth, have a little kiki and go about our days. 

So the coworker told me that B told them something that alarmed them. And it was that B had gone through my phone!

First, I don't even know how she got into it in the first place, I keep it locked at all times. Second, if I don't have eyes on my phone I NEVER leave it out in the open, so that means she had to go through my stuff to get it.

So she saw the texts between me and my sister and got pissed. 

Well guess who's pissed now too?!

I've already scheduled a meeting with HR. 

I was gonna let all the petty BS go, but she crossed a line invading my privacy like that.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

**Beans:** all roast types  
**Coffee style:** Lattes, straight espresso, pour overs (we use a basic electric grinder \~30$)  
**Machine:** Bambino  
**Budget**: around 300 USD. (must be somewhat easily available in US)  
**Workflow needs**: set it and forget it, \~2 espresso drinks or so per day, no clumping/static, little to no mess.

I've seen rec's for the DF series but am put off by the people claiming it has static/clog/QC issues that require people farting around with it to get it to work long-term. I've also seen rec's for the Baratza  ESP or pro line but I worry this is not much better. People have recommended the Niche Zero, but its a bit more expensive and I cannot easily get it in the US.  The Eureka machines (zero/facile) look intriguing but im not sold on it, plus it seems a bit more pricey. I looked into Varia VS3 (second edition) though people are complaining that the dial still moves and its big power brick is unsightly. The Vs4 seems like its fixed the issues but has a large price tag that other brands beat.

I really am not too picky about the micro details, I just want something I can reasonably afford in the USA that can grind beans for espresso consistently and just works. The simplicity is very important to me. A hopper is a plus and the ability to adjust for the occasional pour over is also, but these are not must-haves.

Maybe i'm asking for the impossible but I would love to hear your thoughts.",0,1769482949.0,espresso,10,0.5,False

They regularly pull out of their 401ks and use it like a savings account. They own their home but don't maintain it. I recently learned that they owe money in taxes because they just have avoided it for the last few years.

They are constantly complaining about money and saying that they can't afford anything, but I have no idea how. They have a $2000 mortgage and make about 115k a year. I don't understand how they spend their money or where it goes. They do smoke cigarettes which I know adds up, and my dad plays about $15 of keno/lottery a day. My mom buys a dunks iced coffee every day for like $4. (I do think that they deserve little things that make them happy).

In the oldest of five and all I know it's not my responsibility to take care of them, but I want to make sure they can retire. They are great parents who both work physically demanding jobs. I don't want to see them struggle and have to work into their 70s. But at the same time, my husband and I want to start a family and I am so bitter at them for not planning themselves. I honestly think they're just assuming they'll die or hit big in the lottery before it's time to deal with it.

What steps can I take to help them? They're very sensitive to talking about money and will shut me down immediately if I try and bring it up. Maybe I can set them up to talk to a CPA? Any other suggestions?",17,1769482946.0,FinancialPlanning,34,0.85,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1qo1vjp,https://i.redd.it/xwpa98s05tfg1.jpeg,Keto ice cream and kulfi,"I really love eating sweets like ice creams and i was really craving for one. So i decided to make ice cream and kulfi... Cuz why not? 
So here's the recipe:( please note i live in India and have bought some ingredients that are available locally to me such as specific brands of cream , spices, utensils such as manual egg beater, baking tray etc after checking the labels. you can modify as per the ingredients you get locally while ensuring you are on keto) 

I've also used Ai to refine the text. 

Keto ice cream
Ingredients
 * 1.5 cups Amul or D'lecta Whipping Cream (Cold)
 * 2 tbsp Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
 * 1 tsp Instant Coffee powder (dissolved in 1 tsp warm water)
 * Stevia to taste
 * 1/4 cup Chopped Walnuts or Almonds
 * A pinch of Sea Salt (essential to balance Stevia)

 * Prep the Pan: Place your metal baking pan in the freezer immediately to get it ice-cold.
 * The Coffee-Choco Base: In a small bowl, mix the cocoa powder, dissolved coffee, Stevia, and salt with 2 tablespoons of the cream to make a smooth paste. This prevents cocoa lumps.
 * Whip the Cream: Pour the rest of the cold cream into a chilled bowl. Use your manual egg beater and crank vigorously for about 5–8 minutes. You are aiming for stiff peaks—where the cream stands up on its own. This air is what keeps it soft without the 30-minute stirring rule.
 * Fold it Together: Gently fold your chocolate-coffee paste into the whipped cream using a spatula. Do not over-mix, or you’ll lose the air. Fold in half of your nuts now.
 * The Thin Freeze: Spread the mixture into your pre-chilled baking pan in a thin layer (about 1 inch thick). Sprinkle the remaining nuts on top.
 * Seal and Freeze: Press your baking paper directly onto the surface of the cream to block out air. Place it on the floor of the freezer.

Keto kulfi: 
 
Ingredients
 * 1.5 cups Amul or D’lecta Whipping Cream (Cold)
 * Stevia to taste (start with a small amount and adjust)
 * 1/4 tsp Green Cardamom (Elaichi) powder
 * 1/4 tsp Ground Cinnamon
 * 8-10 Saffron (Kesar) strands, soaked in 1 tsp warm cream
 * Optional: 1 tbsp chopped almonds for texture
Instructions (The 2-Hour Method)
 * Infuse the Flavors: In a small pan, simmer 1/2 cup of the cream with the cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron for about 3–5 minutes. This ""blooms"" the spices and gives you that authentic cooked-milk flavor.
 * Sweeten and Cool: Stir in your Stevia while the mixture is warm. Once combined, let this base cool completely in the fridge for about 10 minutes.
 * Whip the Remainder: While the base cools, take the remaining 1 cup of cold cream and use your manual egg beater to whip it until it is thick and airy (soft peaks). This aeration ensures you don't need to stir it every 30 minutes.
 * Combine: Gently fold the spiced, cooled cream into the whipped cream until the color is uniform.
 * Fill the Moulds: Pour the mixture into your 6 kulfi moulds.
 * The Seal: Cover each mould by pressing a small square of baking paper directly against the surface of the cream to prevent ice crystals.
 * Flash Freeze: Place the moulds in your freezer. They should be set in approximately 2 hours.

**Coruscant, May 12th, 5661**

""What a pleasure it is to make your acquaintance, Count Dooku. If only the conditions were better, of course. What can I, and the Federation, do for you?""

The Count chuckled, ""How professional of you, Ambassador Niles. My spies did not lie. But I must apologize, it wouldn't be right not to do so on account of my droid showing up at your embassy unannounced. And for being so intrusive some months ago.""

James raised a brow at this. ""Care to explain?""

The Count bowed, ""Of course. You see, I was on Coruscant for urgent business when you and your people arrived. Out of curiosity, I had spies follow you and that Naboo senator around. To see how you like this planet. I won't deny that I was pleasantly surprised at the sheer boredom you felt on those tours, but you kept up appearances. I commend you for that."" Dooku then continued.

""They can be rather dull, but what I really wish to apologize for is trying to get a deep, true sense of you. I felt, and still feel, no presence of the Force in any one of you."" The Count looked to the three Terrans.

The Count watched as the man thought on his words carefully. *Show me your secrets, Ambassador. Give me some insight into your civilization. I should commend you for your actions, but won't. Putting a chink into my Master's armor is most impressive.*

James studied the man before speaking. Either he was telling the truth or an exceptional liar. ""So, that was you, huh?"" *I doubt it was him. Perhaps, he's trying to cover for someone else. But then again, he was a former Jedi Master*. James thought.

""Indeed so.""

""Well, I hope I didn't hurt you too much. It's more of a deterrent than a weapon. Quite a few sentient beings in our Federation can use this 'Force'. Not to the level of the Jedi, or the Sith from the Galaxy's histories.""

The Count just stood and listened. ""But I must ask Count."" James began to walk around the droid, hands clasped behind himself, ""Why did you wait so long to reveal yourself to the Federation. Could it be because you, as you say, wanted to learn about us by hiding in the shadows like a cat? Or were you so busy that you had just gotten around to our humble Federation? Fighting in a Galactic civil war, of course, is no easy pickings.""

James made his way to the front of the crowd with his head tall. ""Or was it on the orders? Orders to wait and see what moves we will make on the galactic stage?"" *We can do this all day, old timer.*

The Count chuckled before speaking once more. ""I guess you could say a mixture of the three, ambassador. Though I do not take orders. I give them.""

""I sense a 'but' coming, Count. So, can we skip to the part where you explain as to why you are here, shall we?""

The Count crossed his arms to this, but kept calm. ""Straight to the point? I think we will get along just fine, you and I. But to that, I would like to put the past behind us, to chart a new course between our two governments. You did mention that if the 'Confederacy of Independent Systems' came to you looking to trade, that the Federation of Terra would oblige in such an endeavor. Would I be wrong?""

""Ha! Was this droid the one I heard in the air vents during that meeting?""

""You have keen ears, Ambassador Niles.""

""Please, Count. James is fine.""

""Very well, James. Next month, on our capital planet of the Confederacy, Raxus Secundus. A festival is going to take place. Therefore, I would like to invite you and your people to join us in the celebration... and to discuss some business. What do you say?""

""I'm afraid that I will not be available then, Count. You see, next month is the anniversary of the Federation's founding. I, my aide, and Security Captain will be heading home. With several Republic senators in tow. Another ambassador will be covering here while I am away.""

""But I am sure the new President would love to send an ambassador just for the Confederacy to this event. Would that suffice?""

""Indeed so, James. Just have the droid contact me with the information."" The Count bowed as the hologram shut down. The droid put the disk back into its compartment and sat idle.

""So. It was the Count."" Jennifer thought aloud. ""What happens now?""

*""The guy's likely full of it.""*

James spoke to the two with him aloud. ""We see what the President says. Get me a secure line.""

*""Agreed""*

**Unknown Location**

*Quite a strange bunch. Not a hint of fear. Impressive.* The Count thought as he watched back the recording of his meeting with these 'Terrans'. They are clearly hiding something. The ambassador's tone when speaking of force users tipped the Sith Lord off. Such venom from a Federation so isolated from the rest of the galaxy. He will have to learn their secrets, but time will tell.

*Bedabeep Bedabeep*

Every day for as long as he's been on this planet, the Count would convene with his Master. But usually at a different hour. *He must be most eager to hear my report.* The Count thought as he went to one knee and answered.

""My Lord,"" he said, kneeling.

The figure before him was clad in thick robes from head to toe. His face is slightly visible, revealing only wrinkles of age. The holoprojector made the man a giant. A god-like figure for primitives to worship. ""Lord Tyrannus, what news do you bring from these Terrans? How did this ambassador take your 'confession' of guilt?""

""On the surface, it seems that James Niles has bought it. As you predicted, Master.""

""Good, good. What other information have you gathered?""

The Count grinned. ""It would seem that there's more to these Terrans than what you originally thought, my Lord.""

**Terra/Earth, Atlantis, May 12th, 5661**

Atlantis, The Capital hub of the Federation of Terra. During the early days, Pre-Federation, the original capital moved around every few decades. As was agreed upon, once the planet had been stabilized. Starting from the old former United Nations Headquarters. Going from a list of cities, continent to continent, and ending in the then destroyed Hong Kong, which was now rebuilt as the Dayuan City, combined with Shenzhen and Dongguan. And then starting from the beginning, like a carousel. For nearly five hundred years, this cycle went on from start to finish.

Until an earthquake five years before the Federation's creation sank the then headquarters in the Japanese archipelago into the ocean. In the Fall of 2549, over a hundred thousand men, women, and children perished. So many sentences unaccounted for. The city of Hachinohe now sits as a memorial.

Five months after the ratification of the first Federation Constitution, November 20th, 2554. Alexander Bocknue, an Architect, was part of a squid-like species that could only survive in a liquid mixture of mercury and saltwater. They proposed the creation of a continent-sized capital to be built on *Terra.* Atlantis was then born under Project Infinity. Built in the direct center of the Atlantic Ocean, the first ocean floor foundations were put in place in 2555.

For twenty years, the massive project took every system pitching in on the resources and manpower. At this time, it brought and built the Federation's identity, with Humanity/Human adding another name to itself, Terranian. Terran, and being Terran, changed. No longer meaning from Earth, it meant to be born, or living in the Federation's warm embrace. Held in her arms, whether Human, Lythyian, Neptunian, Octong, Cyclops, or others.

Thousands of species are now grouped as culturally Terran. Terrans destined for the stars.

At the heart of Atlantis is a great Neptunian greenwood tree. First planted a millennium before on the *Frontier*, a Neptunian generation ship that carried them from outside the galaxy thousands of years prior. Left adrift for so long, their home lost in distant legend. All that remained was this one tree, and as a gift for the Federation, which had taken them in, nourished them, and made Neptune their new home, the tree was planted. Now at just under five-thousand years old, the greenwood stands at over six-thousand feet. Looming over all as a reminder for future generations.

The tree is surrounded by government offices such as; The Capitol Building and the Presidential Mansion, *Trinity*. Built off a Neoclassical design, and from genuine marble and limestone from the mines of an abandoned world near the galactic edge, the soul of the architecture was kept alive.

**Trinity, Atlantis, May 12th, 5661**

Elected and sworn in on the first of May. Making it the fastest election in Federation history. Now, President Benjin Serkisyan never thought he would be the one to deal with the galaxy as a whole. In the long line of Presidents, everyone thought that they would be the ones to mediate with the Galactic Republic. That they would hold the torch for peace and diplomacy, cautious neighbors, or light the fires of war. At the young age of one-hundred and forty-seven, Benjin was in the prime of his Terranian life, with his mixed Turkish and Armenian ancestry seeming to embody the Federation's thousands of years of progress.

President Benjin Serkisyan sat listening to James, the Ambassador to the Galactic Republic. He and his cabinet had been having a delightful breakfast to start their morning. *The Breakfast of Champions.*

His report was brief. The Separatist leader, Count Dooku, was the one who tried to enter James' mind. But the confession was too calculated, which would be predictable for a force user.

Or at least, that's what the old data said. The chance of the man being a Sith kept rising with the coming reports. The take-over of planets, subjugation of entire systems, all just so fit to the Sith's playbook. Though disappearing after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan, the Sith Order's deep scars have never left *Terra*. The F.I.A. lost track of a lone ship fleeing the planet almost millennia ago. Now, theories suggest that the lone ship was a Sith Lord survivor.

""That's all I have, Sir. What should I tell the Count?""

""For now, nothing. We'll have an answer for you by the afternoon.""

""Understood. James out.""

They watched as the holodisplay melted like snow in on itself. Sitting in silence, picking at their food. Until one spook. ""Sir, things are accelerating faster than calculated. We should move the fleets into a defensive pattern.""

Secretary of Intergalactic Affairs, C-9579, otherwise known as Charlie, concluded. Their species is known as 'Domonoids', hailing from the planet 'Otto'. Once slaves to a tyrannical ruler for centuries. Their old species name and planet name were erased from all records. Choosing their own path forward. They changed themselves to be calculative, cunning, passionate, and most importantly, loyal to the Federation.

""Is that wise? The border we gave them will be under constant surveillance now. For all we know, both the Republic and Confederacy are eying up 'our' territory."" Benjin suggests, challenging the Domonoid. They all watched as Charlie's blue eye sensor bounced side to side in calculation. *They still think like a machine after all these years*.

""I say we sent a force of ten ships with an Ambassador to Raxus as protection. Flex our muscles at both the Republic and Confederacy. We've all read Jame's reports about how those slimy senator bastards think of us.""

Sina Vang, Secretary of Defense, declared. Benjin had half a mind to agree. But he knew her mother's side was coming through. She stood, showing the options of ships on the Holodisplay. At seven feet tall, she was small for her mother species. Part Cyclops, descended from the original three thousand homeguard of Cyclopea, and part human, the head mechanic of the Mars shipdocks. *Part grease monkey, and part mythical warrior.*

He watched as her muscles bulged in pride of the new Orion class Battleships coming out of Mars ship docks in a week's time on the HoloDisplay.

""Now hold on,"" General Joseph Stinger interjected, ""Sending just one of those could be seen as an act of aggression. From our reports on the CIS naval capabilities. A Jupiter-class destroyer would be more than enough. The Orion Class should be used to replace the defence fleets' Rahman Battleships.""

This round table discussion went on for what felt like hours before Benjin noticed one had remained silent. A veteran of the fourth galactic expansion. Ayda Leodi, an old *Earth* coin dancing between her thin fingers. Her green eyes were watching its every move.

Her pale skin contrasted against her Indicolite uniform of her people, Ernan. When her long blonde hair was down, you could mistake her for Terranian. But once up, as it was now, there was no denying her species' distinct feature. Long, pointed, six-inch ears decorated with emerald rings.

""Director Leodi,"" Benjin cuts through the discussion, ""any input from F.I.A? What do you suggest?""

She stopped the coin on her ring finger; all eyes watched as she rested it on the table. She coughed before speaking. ""Simple, Sir. Keep our heads down and go along with the facade of a small 'backwater' government. Let's send an Ambassador at the Count's request."" Her voice was like fresh silk.

""So, just see where the negotiations go?""

""Essentially. And deploy cloaked beacons in the surrounding space. The CIS was smart in encrypting their transmissions on a different code base from The Republic. I'd say kilometers better than theirs.""

""So we keep sitting on our asses like we've been doing for over three millennia?"" Sina was back at her chair, using it to support her muscular figure. Her knuckles clenched the top, painted nails ready to dig into the fabric. ""Even if what the Count says isn't true, and is covering for one of his own in their government, it's basically an act of war. We have to do something.""

Ayda looked at her, emotionless, eyes on one. The massive eye lid blinking quickly, like a nervous tic. ""I agree, Sina. But we can't go guns blazing as the three-thousand home guard would.""

""And why's that, huh?""

""Because intelligence is the name of the game, then logistics, and lastly, manpower. It is the most important, because its power needs to be used to direct the other two."" She then looked to Benjin, ""Mister President. You know as well as I do that we are going to be dragged into this conflict sooner or later. I say this to all of you as well.""

He thought about the statement and its implications as she continued.

""So what I recommend again is this. Buy as much time as we can, collect critical information, and make as many allies with systems from both the Republic and Confederacy as we can. Preferably, the Outer Rim.""

He raised an eyebrow to this, along with everyone else at the table. Then he understood, ""Hmm, I can see where you're going. If it comes down to it, we divide and conquer. Surround them, then emerge as the victor.""

""Exactly.""

""Charlie, what is the probability of either the Republic or the Confederacy attacking us first?""

Attention went to the Domonoid, who then projected various statistics. ""Mister President, the numbers are showing here that the odds right now of either are lower than before the 'First Contact'. With the Galactic Republic at forty-eight percent, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems at fifty-two percent.""

""All of these will very likely change if and when the Galactic Community finds out what happened over three millennia. It's how you Humans say, 'It's a crapshoot'.""

""Noted. Admiral Lang, we need a ship. Any ideas? Nothing too flashy, eh?"" Benjin questioned the old man to his right. He remained quiet as he sipped his coffee.

Admiral Władysław Lang, the Secretary of the Navy, is a man with a reputation for battle. You could mistake him for a grandfather. But at two-hundred and twenty-five, he's still in his prime. The gray mustache makes him resemble those from early twentieth-century photographs of generals.

His gruff, German-Polish accent came clear from the artificial tongue. ""I have one in mind, Sir. But I must ask, could it be multiple ships? Or just one.""

""One or two should suffice.""

""Very good, Sir. Then I suggest the FTS Empress Josephine and Queen Mary, respectively. Both being frigates should be a good show of force. Though with the Confederacy Munificent-class star frigates being about two-hundred meters shorter, this should show how different we designate ships.""

He stopped for questions, but was met with silence. Allowing one to compose herself, once seated, Sina started. ""The Empress Josephine, and Queen Mary? Are you suggesting the Venus-class frigates?""

""Yes.""

""Those two are over a thousand years old, and the last of their class. As well as being an experimental class of ships, they are set to transition into museums by year's end. Why in Antoria's Six Moons would we send those two?""

The Admiral finished his coffee before speaking. He placed it on the table, allowing an automated system to replenish to his preference. ""Simple."" He gestured a command from his NIC to the HoloDisplay. Rippling a screen for all to see, the two ships in question showed. Along with a Munificent-class star frigate. Each spinning slowly to show its every detail.

""The Venus-class has about the same firepower as the Munificent. If not more, depending on the variant. Since the last two of the Venus-class are Empress and Queens, they are comparable to the old Harrower-class dreadnought of the long-gone 'New' Sith Empire, but of course with modern equipment. Not in design, of course.""

The Quark-Scale hypercomputer battle simulation data appeared. In terms of using the similar kind of hardware, it should be even with minor differences. Benjin and his cabinet took in the flow of data.

Differences transpired when taking into account the Terran factor. Citizens of the Federation operating such crafts put the odds far above those of robots operating the Munificents. A game of catch-up in skill trickles high and high with each encounter.

""They will do, and who are their Captains?"" Benjin questioned. Sina brought the file up. Faces, rank, achievements, birthplace, age, gender, reflexes, and morale of the crew all listed.

""Of the Empress Josephine is Captain Hugo Monet. Born in Napoleon, Mars. Ninety-eight years of age and has been the Empress Josephine's captain for fifty-one. Service records show multiple achievements, including during the Silent Night campaigns and the War of the Five Empresses. The Monets have basically captained that Frigate since she left the dry-dock, Sir.""

""I've heard about the Monets. Legends in the academy, and what about the Queen Mary?"" He questioned, allowing her to change displays. This one, however, he had known more of, practically an extension of his own family.

""Captain Emilia Niles of the Queen Mary. Born in Atlantis, Terra. Forty-five years old and has been her captain for five years. The Niles are basically a political family. All but her have held some form of government office in the Federation. And wanted to-""

Benjin cut him off, ""I know what she wanted. She had me sign her up for the damn academy behind her parents' back,"" he said, staring at the display, sighing. *James isn't gonna like this.*

1qo1q0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1qo1q0k/the_cigarette_case/,The Cigarette Case,"🇵🇱Gdańsk, Poland. The 90s.

Kazimierz found the cigarette case one morning on a bench as he walked his usual route through the park to the shipyard, where he worked as a painter. In the gloom, the ugly outlines of creaking cranes loomed, resembling sick birds, and the smell of dampness and rotting autumn leaves seemed to crawl directly into his soul, causing fits of melancholy.

Kazimierz looked around and, seeing no one nearby, picked up the case from the rain-soaked bench. It was silver, looked simple — without inscriptions or engravings. On the move, Kazimierz opened it and saw that it was full.

— O kurwa! — Kazimierz exclaimed with joy. — O kurwa! To dobrze!

He was genuinely happy about the find: his cigarettes had run out yesterday, and Kazimierz desperately wanted a smoke. He took out a filter cigarette with no markings, sniffed it, and, after making sure it was tobacco, lit it and took a greedy drag. His head swam, and with a sigh of relief, he exhaled the smoke, noting that the tobacco was excellent. Pleased, feeling as if on wings, Kazimierz hurried to the gate to make it to his shift on time.

The rusty wind beat against the walls of the smoking area when the crew came out for their afternoon break.

— Got a smoke, Kazimierz? — his partner Tadeusz asked, coughing terribly and spitting up yellow phlegm. — We’ll smoke mine tomorrow.

— Here, — Kazimierz said, opening the case and offering him a cigarette.

— Wow, good tobacco, — Tadeusz said, taking a drag, and again went into a fit of coughing, exhaling smoke.

— Kurwa mać, this painting work will be the end of me, I’ll cough up my lungs, — Tadeusz rasped glumly.

Kazimierz remained silent. He knew about the harm, but he continued to go to this job, as if chained, just like all the other laborers. He saw their thoughts on their faces in the morning and knew what they were thinking when they walked home from work.

The next morning, Kazimierz, as always, woke up earlier than anyone else and left while his son and wife were still asleep. Coffee and a cigarette on an empty stomach were his loyal morning friends. And, opening the case, he saw that it was full again.

— Matko Boska!, that can’t be! — Kazimierz exclaimed and began to carefully examine the case and the cigarettes. Nothing unusual. But he couldn’t believe his eyes and tore up one cigarette: it looked like tobacco, good tobacco, and the smell was right.

— Fine, — he said, snapping the case shut and finding no explanation for what had happened. He lit up, sipping his coffee, looking out the window, and thinking about the miracles that still happen in this world.

So several days passed, and every morning the case was full. Kazimierz, offering the foreman a cigarette in the morning, asked about Tadeusz.

— I called his wife, Agnieszka, last night, — the foreman replied. — She said he died. First, he started throwing up blood, and then he coughed up his lungs into the sink. The ambulance didn’t make it.

— Jezu Chryste… — Kazimierz whispered, his blood running cold, and stepped away. He understood that the case was the cause. The very one from which he had been handing out cigarettes left and right. “Who’s next?” — Kazimierz thought with horror. After smoking down to the filter and burning his fingers, he immediately lit the next one.

— Heard the news, Kazimierz? — the workers asked in the smoking area.

— What news? — he asked, growing cold inside.

— Waldek, our grinder, died. He choked on phlegm in his sleep. How did he manage that?..

Kazimierz shrugged indifferently and, without another word, went back to work.

Over the next few months, a series of accidents and fatal illnesses wiped out almost the entire old crew of their shift. Only Kazimierz and a few other guys who didn’t smoke were left. Just yesterday, after work, when Kazimierz offered a cigarette to a new guy, the man died in a crash, his head hitting the dash as his car swerved into oncoming traffic. The cause of the accident was a cigarette that had fallen onto the seat.

Maybe the cigarette case wasn’t forgotten or lost, but left there on purpose? Maybe someone before couldn’t bear the weight and got rid of it that way?

These thoughts swirled in Kazimierz’s head as he stood early in the morning in that same gloomy park at the familiar bench. He thought: it’s time to leave it, to throw it away for good, enough!

At the same time, he rationalized it to himself: now he was more careful — he only offered cigarettes from the case to random passersby. For his own, he had a regular pack.

— Tomorrow… I’ll throw it away tomorrow, — Kazimierz promised himself and hurried to work, knowing deep down that this “tomorrow” would never come.

That night, his son woke up, needing to use the toilet. Returning, he noticed the edge of the cigarette case sticking out of his father’s jacket pocket. Listening — everyone was asleep — he quietly and carefully pulled out two cigarettes for himself and a friend.

“Well, even if Dad notices, what’s he gonna do? Spank me?” — the boy thought.

So I began keto over 2 weeks ago. I started slowly because I wasn't sure if I wanted to do this- my main motivation was friends who have taken it who have had massive increases in energy. Week 1 was fine, though I went over the 20g carbs goal frequently. Week 2, I got more serious and started to get keto flu symptoms- low energy, nausea, lack of appetite, headache. I course corrected with electrolytes and broth. But appetite and and energy have not come back. I tried the keto urine test straps today and came back purple, so I think I am in the right spot, but I need guidance for a few things.

Firstly- I'm really struggling to meet my macros, I just don't have the appetite for 1,500 calories everyday anymore. I'm doing okay at keeping under 20g of net carbs as shown above.  Should I be concerned about not getting enough protein or fats?

I am a swimmer, and I like lifting weights and dancing, but the last 2 times I went to work out, I fell asleep at my desk the next day. Not great. If I'm showing as in ketosis, (urine strips) where is my energy? Is this tiredness from not eating enough fat? This is so much worse than before I started.

If I drink a glass of water, I have to pee 20min later. I'm waking up in the night parched. I'm adding salt to my water, but is this normal? Today i drank a liter of decaf coffee, 2 liters of herbal tea, a liter of stock, a liter of electrolyte water. Still just in and out. Is this normal?

I guess i'm just looking for assurance that this is all normal and i'm just going through the usual process. ",1,1769482261.0,ketobeginners,1,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Nothing out of the ordinary, but turns out, I managed to place it directly under one of my monstera’s stems. Once it drooped and I noticed it, I put the candle out and propped the stem up on another, taller candle in hopes that it would somehow heal. It didn’t burn it, it’s not charred, but the heat literally cooked it. 

Now, it’s been a week or so and the part that I cooked has gone dark and hard. I’m thinking if I leave it this way, the leaf is gonna die. Although, if I can save it and keep it on the plant somehow, please tell me how!!

My dilemma is what to do now? Could the healthy part of my plant be taking the nutrients from the dying part or is it just dying? Could I snip the leaf off just above the cooked part and propagate it? Do I wait for it to die before removing it or should I just get it over with? I don’t want to put my monstera through too much stress if I can as it only will have three leaves left after this one goes.

General info about the plant: 

I don’t water it as much as I should, but it’s frequent enough so that it doesn’t droop often! 

I have it right in a window but being in a NYC apartment, I only get two hours a day of direct sunlight.

I put coffee grounds and eggshells in the soil to give it extra nutrients after I traumatized it.

The affected leaf started to yellow yesterday and it’s going quickly. 

I have another leaf that just unraveled but it’s droopy so if anyone had tips for that too, I’d love to hear it lol (last two photos)",1,1769481958.0,plantclinic,3,1.0,False

Overall: boy howdy it was rough, but I’d do it again. 

In my initial recovery I was on a crack load of calcium and vitamin D, and that sent my into hypercalcemia, which put my in the hospital for three days. They then told me don’t take any calcium, so I didn’t, then I was back in the hospital with hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. I decided I’d had enough of being yanked around and figured out what dose/nutrient balance worked for me, and ignored doctor’s orders for about a week and it sorted itself out. 

I got a skin infection that required antibiotics. My T3 and T4 got high and my TSH was super low, and all that triggered All Of The Itchy that I’m still trying to get straightened out - dyshydrosis on my hands, weeping plaques on my scalp, rashes on the underarms, and incredibly fragile skin. 

OK THAT’S ENOUGH OF THE BAD

Through all of this though I have felt fantastic. My mind is clear, and though it takes me a little longer to get to sleep since I have energy, the sleep is restful. Coffee is optional (when my preschooler sleeps, anyway). I’ve joined the local Y and enjoy going, and still have the energy to do household things after. So yes it has been ROUGH, but even if I knew I’d have to go through all of it I’d still do it. My anxiety is so much less, my brain can think through problems without panicking. My relationship with my husband is better. I’m more patient with our daughter. I even think my hEDS symptoms are better. We went to the aquarium and I didn’t have to lie down after. I feel ten years younger because I can DO things again.

1qo1g2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1qo1g2z/where_the_distance_collapsed/,Where the Distance Collapsed,"My name is **Evan Alder**, and for the last twelve years I’ve been the person people call when someone doesn’t come home.

That’s not a poetic way of putting it. It’s the job description, just without the bullet points.

Search and Rescue work is mostly arithmetic; time, distance, elevation gain, weather windows, daylight. We turn lives into numbers because numbers are honest, and because hope, by itself, is not a plan. I’ve coordinated everything from sprained ankles to late-season hypothermia to recoveries no one says out loud until you’re back at the command trailer and the radios finally go quiet.

I’ve learned what fear looks like on paper.

It shows up as missed check-ins, wrong trailheads, a vehicle that’s still warm in the parking lot, a water bottle left behind like it fell out of a hand that didn’t have time to close.

This one started with a single sentence from dispatch that I didn’t like the sound of.

“Missing hiker,” the deputy said over the phone, “and his last known location doesn’t make sense.”

That was what he led with, as if that kind of thing was rare.

It was a Tuesday in early fall, one of those sharp mornings where the air looks clean enough to drink. The first frost hadn’t hit yet, but the nights were cold, and the trees were already deciding what to keep.

The missing hiker was named **Caleb Rourke**, thirty-two, software engineer from the city, weekend backpacker. His girlfriend, **Jillian Park**, called it in when he didn’t answer her texts by nightfall. That part was normal. His vehicle was at the south trailhead of a backcountry network the locals just called *the bowls*, because the terrain folded into itself in a series of steep drainages and rounded ridgelines. You could be two miles from your car and still feel like you’d been swallowed.

The deputy’s issue was Caleb’s phone location. Jillian had shared it through one of those “find my” apps, desperate and practical at the same time. The dot wasn’t hovering over the parking lot or the first mile of trail. It was deep. Too deep for a day hike unless you were moving with purpose.

And the timestamp attached to the last ping made it worse.

The last location update came in at **4:18 PM**, and it put Caleb nearly **eight miles in**, past the second bowl and close to a ridge that took most people half a day to reach even with a light pack.

Jillian insisted he’d planned a short loop. Four miles, maybe five, back before dark. She’d said it through tears, but she’d said it with certainty.

Eight miles in by 4:18, and then nothing. No movement. No further pings.

It looked like he’d stopped.

In our world, stopping is what kills you.

By the time I drove up to the trailhead, my incident kit was already sitting on the passenger seat like a weight. Maps, flagging tape, extra batteries, laminated grid overlays, spare radio mic. I parked beside the deputy’s SUV and found Jillian on the tailgate, clutching a phone so hard her knuckles had bleached.

She looked up when I approached. Her eyes were raw like she’d been swimming in something abrasive.

“I can show you,” she said immediately, as if I might not believe her.

I introduced myself, and she gave a jerky nod. Jillian was in her late twenties, hair pulled into a messy knot, wearing running shoes that had never seen dirt. She was trying to be a person who could handle this.

The deputy, **Mark Denton**, stood nearby with his arms folded, watching the tree line like he expected it to move.

Jillian shoved the screen toward me.

The dot was exactly where Mark had described it. Deep in the bowls, pinned to a tight contour section that the map labeled with nothing but elevation lines stacked like teeth. A place that didn’t have a name, which meant it wasn’t a place most people went on purpose.

I asked the questions I always ask.

“What time did he leave?”

“Ten forty. Maybe ten fifty.”

“What was he wearing?”

“Gray jacket. Blue pack. He has a red beanie. He always wears it.”

“Experience level?”

“He hikes a lot. He’s not stupid.”

Nobody is stupid until they are cold, alone, and trying to make the world behave.

“Any medical issues?”

She shook her head. “He… he had a GPS app. He had a battery pack. He was excited. He said he wanted to get away from screens for once, which was… funny, because he literally builds them.”

She tried to laugh, and it broke halfway out.

I looked at the map again. Eight miles in. The dot was static. If Caleb had stopped because he’d twisted an ankle, he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he’d gotten lost and decided to “wait it out,” he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he couldn’t move, then we were already late.

I started the operation.

Within an hour we had our command trailer set up, our whiteboard filled with names and assignments, and a half-dozen volunteers arriving in dusty trucks. Our team is a patchwork of professions; nurses, mechanics, a high school math teacher, a guy who runs a towing company, a retired firefighter who still wears his old station jacket like armor.

I called in **Tessa Wynn**, our logistics lead, who could run a staging area like an airport. I called **Luis Ortega**, our best tracker, whose eyes didn’t miss broken fern stems or a scuffed rock. I called **Casey Harlow**, our comms specialist, who had the kind of calm voice that made frightened people breathe slower.

By noon, we had two hasty teams ready to deploy, and one technical team on standby in case we had to rope down into one of the bowls.

The plan was straightforward; you always start by assuming the world is normal.

Team One would head toward Caleb’s last known ping location along the main trail, then cut into the first drainage and work their way up. Team Two would approach from the east ridge and look down into the bowls from above, scanning for movement, color, any sign of a pack or a person. If we found a track, Luis would take it. If we found evidence, we’d expand the search.

I briefed everyone, and I watched their faces as I pointed at the map. They were listening, but I could see the subtle shift when I mentioned the distance.

Eight miles. Steep terrain. Late afternoon ping. No movement.

We were all doing the same math.

Casey ran radio checks. Everything came back clean.

“Tessa to Base, radio check.”

“Base to Tessa, loud and clear.”

“Luis to Base, check.”

“Base to Luis, loud and clear.”

Team One moved out first. I stayed at base with Casey and Tessa, monitoring, updating, and keeping the operation’s shape intact. That’s what incident coordinators do; we don’t chase, we direct. We keep the puzzle pieces from turning into scattered debris.

At **1:12 PM**, Team One called their first check-in. They’d reached the first junction, exactly as expected.

At **1:47 PM**, Team Two checked in from the ridge approach, moving steadily, no visual on Caleb.

At **2:09 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One. We’ve got sign.”

My spine tightened.

“Go ahead.”

“Fresh boot scuffs off the main trail, about a mile and a half in. Not on the map, not a social trail either. It’s like he stepped off on purpose.”

“Any other prints?”

“Hard to tell. Soil’s dry. But there’s a consistent scuff pattern, same tread. Looks like a trail runner, not a boot.”

That matched Jillian’s description. Running shoes.

Luis added, “He’s moving fast, or he was. The scuffs are long, like he was taking big strides.”

I wrote it on the board. Unplanned off-trail. Fast movement.

“Track it,” I said. “Mark it. Keep comms tight.”

“Copy.”

Normal so far. People step off trail. They follow game paths, they chase a view, they think they can shortcut. Eighty percent of our rescues begin with someone deciding the map is optional.

At **2:42 PM**, the first inconsistency arrived like a stone through glass.

“Base, this is Team One.”

I recognized the voice; **Drew Calhoun**, steady, competent. “Go ahead, Team One.”

“We’re… we’re at the creek crossing.”

I frowned. The creek crossing was three miles in, not one and a half. “Confirm location.”

Drew exhaled. “Creek crossing. It’s the one with the fallen log, the wide bend. We’ve got the rock outcrop on the left, and the dead snag on the right, same as the map notes.”

I looked at the map. I looked at the clock. Team One left base at 12:55. It was 2:42. That was one hour and forty-seven minutes.

To reach that creek crossing in under two hours, they would’ve had to jog, and even then it didn’t make sense with packs.

“Drew,” I said carefully, “what pace are you moving?”

A pause. “Normal. We’re not pushing. Terrain’s been… easier than I remember.”

“Easier,” Casey mouthed, watching me.

I pushed my thumb against the map edge as if the paper might correct itself.

“Any chance you took the wrong fork?” I asked.

“No,” Drew said, and the way he said it made my stomach drop. He sounded offended, but not because I’d questioned him. Because the question itself didn’t fit what he was seeing.

He added, “We passed the junction, we confirmed it. We’re on the right trail. Evan, we’re where we are.”

There are moments in this job where you choose between arguing with reality and adapting to it. I didn’t know which one this was.

“Copy,” I said. “Hold for a minute. I’m going to cross-check.”

I muted my mic and looked at Casey. “Check their last GPS breadcrumb,” I said. “The team unit, not their phones.”

Casey pulled up the tracking dashboard. Each team carried a shared GPS unit that dropped points at intervals. It wasn’t fancy, but it was reliable.

Her eyes narrowed. “That’s… weird.”

“What?”

“They’re showing at the creek crossing,” she said, “but their breadcrumb trail isn’t continuous. There’s a gap.”

“How big?”

Casey zoomed. “Two miles. One point is near the junction, then the next point is… just past the creek.”

I stared. A gap like that meant the unit had lost signal, or been turned off. But the forest wasn’t dense enough for a complete blackout, and Drew wasn’t sloppy.

“Ask if they powered down,” I said.

Casey keyed up. “Team One, Base. Confirm GPS unit status. Any power loss, battery swap, or shutdown?”

Drew replied immediately. “Negative. Unit’s been on the whole time.”

Casey looked at me. In the trailer, the radio hiss filled the silence between our breaths.

I told myself it was a glitch. Satellite drift. Device error. The kind of thing that happens and gets blamed on trees and terrain.

Then Luis called again.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go ahead.”

“You’re not going to like this,” Luis said, and his voice had lost its normal calm.

I sat forward. “Say it.”

“I was tracking the scuffs. They led me down into the first drainage, then… they just stop.”

“Stop like on rock?”

“No. Stop like someone picked him up and set him down somewhere else. The scuff pattern ends at a flat patch of dirt. No pivot, no stumble, no turnaround. Just… ends.”

The image formed in my mind; a line drawn, then cut clean.

Luis continued, “I found a water bottle. Clear plastic. Still cold, like it hasn’t been sitting in the sun long.”

My pulse thudded once, hard.

“Is it his?” I asked.

“There’s a sticker on it,” Luis said. “A tech company logo. A rocket.”

Jillian had mentioned he worked in software. People put their identity on their gear now, like we’re all branded.

“Bag it,” I said. “Mark location.”

Luis hesitated. “Evan… that location is wrong.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m looking at the map. I’m standing where the scuffs ended. This should be a steep section. It should be brush and loose rock. But it’s flat, like a shelf. Like the hillside got shaved off.”

I rubbed my forehead. A flat shelf in the drainage. Not impossible, but unusual.

“Send coordinates,” I said.

Casey took them and plotted. Her brows lifted.

“That’s not in the drainage,” she said quietly. “That’s… that’s closer to Bowl Two.”

Bowl Two was miles away.

I stared at the screen. “Maybe the coordinate format is wrong.”

Casey shook her head. “No. It’s correct.”

I keyed up. “Luis, confirm you’re seeing the first drainage. Confirm landmarks.”

Luis answered with the impatience of a man being asked whether the sky was above him.

“I can see the junction ridge behind me. I can hear the creek from Bowl One. I’m in Bowl One.”

“Copy,” I said, and my mouth went dry. “Hold.”

I turned to Tessa. “How many teams are out?”

“Two,” she said. “Plus Luis with his partner, **Mara Keene**.”

Mara was a paramedic who tracked with Luis because she was stubborn and fast and didn’t panic. If anything went wrong, Mara was the kind of person who would tie your life to hers without asking.

I breathed out slowly and tried to impose order.

“Okay,” I said. “We have three anomalies; Team One is ahead of schedule, Team One’s GPS breadcrumb has a gap, Luis is physically in one place but his coordinates plot in another.”

Casey looked pale. “Could be device error across the board.”

“Across different devices,” I said. “Different satellites, different users.”

In the field, when multiple instruments disagree, you default to the simplest explanation; human mistake. Misread junction, wrong ridge, miskeyed coordinate.

But Drew wasn’t a rookie. Luis was allergic to sloppy data. Casey’s equipment was checked and double-checked.

And then the radios picked up a voice that shouldn’t have been there at all.

It came over the search frequency, weak and crackling, like someone talking through a mouthful of water.

“Base… this is Caleb.”

Every hair on my arms stood up.

Casey’s eyes snapped to mine, and for a second neither of us moved. In the trailer, even the heater fan seemed too loud.

“Say again,” I said into the mic, and I hated how steady my voice sounded. I hated that it didn’t sound surprised, as if some part of me had already been expecting it.

The voice came again, clearer, and it made my stomach turn because it sounded tired.

“Base, this is Caleb. I’m… I’m at the creek. I can see the log. I can’t… I can’t find the trail back. It’s not—”

The signal broke into static.

I stared at the radio like it might grow hands and explain itself.

Casey whispered, “That’s not possible. We don’t have his frequency.”

We didn’t. Caleb wasn’t carrying one of our radios. Jillian hadn’t mentioned any handheld. Even if he had a cheap FRS set, he wouldn’t be on our channel unless he’d somehow matched it by accident.

Team One was at the creek crossing. Drew had just said so.

And now a voice claiming to be Caleb was saying he was at the creek crossing, unable to find the trail back.

“Drew,” I said immediately, “Team One, did you just transmit on search frequency?”

“No,” Drew replied, too fast. “We didn’t transmit. We’re holding. Evan, we’re… we’re hearing it too.”

“Copy,” I said.

The radio hissed. The forest outside remained indifferent.

I keyed up again, careful with the words. “Caleb, this is Base. If you can hear me, say your full name and describe what you see.”

Static. Then, faintly, “Caleb Rourke. There’s… water. The log. The dead tree. Someone’s yelling, but it’s… it’s like it’s far away even though it’s right there.”

His breath hitched, and the sound that followed was not a sob, not exactly, but the noise someone makes when they realize the world has stopped following rules.

“I can see the trail,” he whispered. “It’s right there. It’s right there, and it’s not…”

Static swallowed the rest.

Casey’s fingers flew over her console. “Signal origin,” she muttered. “Come on.”

She pulled up the directional antenna readings from our command unit. It gave a rough bearing when a transmission hit strong enough.

The bearing arrow pointed dead ahead.

Straight into the bowls.

I glanced at the map again. If Caleb’s last phone ping was near the second bowl, and he was now transmitting from the creek crossing, and Team One was already at the creek crossing, then either Caleb had doubled back faster than physics allowed, or someone was spoofing us, or we were hearing a recording.

Or, and I didn’t want to think it, the creek crossing wasn’t one place anymore.

I made a decision that felt like stepping onto ice.

“Team One,” I said, “approach the creek crossing slowly. Call out. Do not cross the log. Confirm if you hear a voice in person.”

Drew’s voice came back, low. “Copy.”

I switched channels to Luis. “Luis, Mara, I need you to move toward the creek crossing, but do it cautiously. Flag your route. If you lose visual on each other, stop.”

Mara answered instead of Luis, her voice clipped. “Copy, Evan. We’re moving.”

Tessa stepped closer to me, her face serious. “Do we call in more assets?”

“Not yet,” I said, though my stomach wanted to say yes to anything that felt like control. “Let’s verify before we escalate.”

The truth is, escalation in wilderness operations is still just people walking. More boots, more radio chatter, more fatigue. If something was wrong with distance itself, then adding more bodies might just add more variables.

I watched the clock.

At **3:18 PM**, Team One came back.

“Base,” Drew said, and his voice was different. Not panicked, but careful, like he’d stepped into a room where someone had been arguing.

“We’re at the creek.”

“Copy. Visual contact with subject?”

Silence, then: “Negative.”

“Do you hear anything?”

Another pause. “We can hear someone breathing. Not like… not like near us. Like it’s coming from the creek itself.”

I felt cold crawl up my ribs.

“Drew,” I said, “describe what you mean.”

He swallowed audibly. “It’s like the sound is inside the water. Like when you put your head under and you can hear the world muffled. That kind of sound. But the creek isn’t loud enough to hide it.”

Casey shook her head slowly, as if refusing.

Drew continued, “We called out. No response in person. But… Evan, the radio.”

“Go on.”

“It’s answering us,” he said, and the way he said it made my mouth go dry. “When we call out, the radio transmits back, but it’s delayed. Like an echo, except it’s words.”

My thoughts snagged on a memory of training; radio reflections, signal bounce, weird atmospheric conditions. But this wasn’t a mountain repeating static. This was language.

Casey leaned toward the mic. “Team One, ask the voice what time it is.”

Drew didn’t argue. He keyed up.

“Caleb,” Drew said, steady, like he was talking to a frightened person on a ledge. “What time is it?”

Static. Then, faint and breathy, Caleb’s voice.

“Four eighteen.”

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like I’d missed a step.

That was the time of the last phone ping.

Drew’s voice shook slightly. “Base, did you hear that?”

“I heard it,” I said.

Casey stared at her console as if it might confess.

Four eighteen. The last timestamp. The moment Caleb had stopped moving, at least as far as Jillian’s app could tell.

But it was barely past three now.

I forced myself to speak. “Drew, do not cross the log. Mark the area. Look for physical evidence; gear, clothing, tracks. Anything.”

“Copy,” Drew said, and I could tell he was relieved to be given tasks. Tasks are walls we build against the dark.

I turned to Casey. “Pull Jillian’s phone logs. Every ping. Every timestamp. I want the last hour in detail.”

Casey nodded, fingers moving.

Tessa looked at me. “Evan, what is this?”

I stared at the map, at the contour lines stacked tight where the land folded into bowls like hands closing.

“Either we’re dealing with technology error,” I said, and my voice sounded too small for the trailer, “or we’re dealing with a location that isn’t behaving like a location.”

At **3:41 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go.”

Luis’s voice was low, and it carried that tone he used when he’d found something he didn’t want to name.

“We found a second bottle,” he said. “Same sticker. Same model. Same cap bite marks.”

“That’s impossible,” Casey whispered.

Luis added, “And Evan… it’s warm.”

Warm meant recently held. Warm meant skin contact.

“Location?” I asked.

Luis hesitated. “That’s the problem. It’s on the ridge above Bowl Two.”

“That’s miles from you,” I said.

“I know,” Luis replied, and he sounded angry now, angry the way a person sounds when their senses are being insulted. “We haven’t climbed. We’ve been moving downhill toward the creek. We should not be on any ridge.”

Mara cut in, her voice tight. “Evan, the trees changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“They’re wrong,” Mara said. “Same forest, but different. The moss is on the wrong side. The deadfall patterns aren’t consistent. It’s like we’re walking through a copy that got… arranged by someone who didn’t understand it.”

Her breathing was controlled, but I could hear the effort.

Luis’s voice came back. “We can see the creek below us, but it’s too far down. It wasn’t like this ten minutes ago.”

I pressed the heel of my hand to my forehead. “Stop moving. Flag your position. Take a bearing. Confirm with GPS.”

Casey’s console beeped softly. She looked at the screen, then at me, then back again.

“Evan,” she whispered, “Luis’s unit just jumped.”

“How far?”

She swallowed. “Three point two miles. In one update interval.”

No one covers three miles in thirty seconds.

I took the mic. “Luis, Mara, do you see the creek?”

“Yes,” Mara said quickly. “But it’s… it’s not lining up with the sound. It looks close, but it sounds far. The distance doesn’t match the way it feels.”

The words landed with a sick certainty.

Distance doesn’t match the way it feels.

That was not a technology error. That was a symptom.

I made another decision, and it tasted like metal.

“Luis,” I said, “do you have line of sight to the creek crossing log?”

A pause, then: “We might. It’s… hard to tell. The view is wrong.”

“Do not descend,” I said. “Hold where you are. Keep each other in sight. I’m sending Team Two to your bearing to establish a visual anchor.”

Team Two, led by **Nina Cho**, was on the ridge approach. If they could see Luis and Mara from above, then we could triangulate and restore reality through geometry.

At least, that’s what my brain told itself.

At **4:02 PM**, Jillian returned to the command trailer. Tessa had kept her occupied, fed her water, done the human things while I did the operational ones.

Jillian’s face was gray with exhaustion, but her eyes were bright with a desperate kind of focus.

“Any news?” she asked.

I weighed my words. You never lie to family. You also don’t hand them raw fear.

“We’re getting signals,” I said carefully. “We’re working toward a confirmation.”

She stepped closer. “His phone updated.”

Casey looked up sharply. “What?”

Jillian held out her phone. The dot had moved.

It was now at the creek crossing.

The timestamp said **4:18 PM**.

My blood went cold.

It was 4:03.

Jillian stared at me like I was the one who had done it. “How is it four eighteen?”

“It’s not,” I said, and the way the words came out, flat and absolute, seemed to frighten her more than any comforting lie could have.

Casey grabbed the phone, checked the network, checked the time settings. The phone time was correct. The app time was correct.

Only the location ping was wrong.

Or it was right, and our definition of “now” was the thing that had drifted.

The radio crackled again, and Caleb’s voice returned, clearer than before, like someone stepping closer to a window.

“Base,” he said, and he sounded calmer, which was worse. “I can see you.”

I froze.

Drew’s voice came instantly. “Caleb, where are you? We don’t see you.”

Caleb whispered, “You’re right there.”

Casey’s eyes darted to me, wide.

Caleb continued, and his voice had the dazed quality of someone describing something they didn’t have words for.

“I’m at the creek,” he said. “I’m on the log. I’m looking at all of you. You’re not… you’re not standing where you are.”

Drew’s voice sharpened. “Caleb, step off the log. Step back.”

A pause, then Caleb’s quiet, bewildered answer.

“I can’t. The log is longer than it should be.”

The trailer felt too small suddenly, as if the walls had moved closer.

Jillian made a sound behind me, a strangled breath.

I took the mic, because I needed my voice in the system, needed an anchor.

“Caleb,” I said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator. Listen to me carefully. Do you see the water? Do you see the dead snag on the right side?”

“Yes,” he said, and his voice shook at the edges. “But it’s… it’s looping. The water keeps meeting itself.”

I closed my eyes for a second, just long enough to feel the weight of my own heartbeat.

When I opened them, Casey was watching me like she was waiting for permission to be afraid.

“Caleb,” I said, “I need you to tell me something only you and Jillian would know.”

Jillian leaned forward, trembling.

Caleb’s voice came softly. “We went to that ramen place, the one with the paper lanterns. She made me try the soft egg even though I said it looked weird.”

Jillian’s hand flew to her mouth. Tears spilled instantly, silent and unstoppable.

It was him.

It was him, and he was talking to us from a place where the creek met itself and time was a circle you could step onto.

My mind tried to salvage a plan.

“Drew,” I said, “Team One, extend a line. Throw a rope to the log, but do not cross. Keep tension light. We’re not pulling. We’re giving him an anchor.”

Drew answered, “Copy.”

I switched to Team Two. “Nina, I need you to establish visual on Luis and Mara. Confirm if you can see their exact position. Give me bearings.”

“Copy,” Nina replied.

Everything moved at once after that, like we’d kicked a hive.

Team One secured a rope to a tree, tossed the coil. Drew narrated, voice tight but professional. The rope landed near the log.

“Caleb,” Drew called, “reach for the rope. Tie it around your waist if you can.”

Caleb’s breathing came through the radio like a tide. “It’s… it’s closer on your side than mine.”

“Reach anyway,” Drew said.

There was a sound then, a faint scraping, as if fabric had dragged across wood.

“I have it,” Caleb whispered, and Jillian sobbed aloud behind me, raw and involuntary.

Drew’s relief came through in a single exhale. “Good. Hold it. Don’t move.”

Caleb’s voice was suddenly very small. “Drew,” he said.

“How do you know my name?” Drew snapped, and then immediately sounded regretful.

Caleb didn’t answer the question. “Drew,” he said again, “you’re standing behind yourself.”

Drew went silent.

Then, in the background of Drew’s transmission, I heard something else, faint but unmistakable.

Another voice.

Drew’s voice, delayed, like an echo that had learned how to speak.

“Team One to Base,” the delayed voice said, “we’re at the creek crossing.”

Casey stared at me, horrified.

The radio was not bouncing. It was repeating, but not as a loop. As a second channel of reality that was slightly out of phase.

Nina called in, and her voice was sharp enough to cut.

“Base, Team Two. We have visual on Luis and Mara.”

“Copy,” I said quickly. “Confirm their position.”

There was a pause that felt like the air holding its breath.

Nina’s voice returned, lower. “Evan… we have visual on Luis and Mara, but…”

“But what?”

“There are two pairs,” she said, and the words came out like she didn’t want her mouth to form them. “Two positions. Same clothing. Same movements. Like a delayed mirror.”

My hands went numb on the map.

In the trailer, Jillian was shaking so hard the chair beneath her rattled.

I keyed up to Luis. “Luis, do you hear Team Two? They have visual on you.”

Luis’s response was immediate. “We can see them too,” he said, and his voice sounded strained, as if he’d been holding something heavy for too long. “But… Evan, there’s another Team Two.”

My stomach lurched.

Mara’s voice came, soft and urgent. “Evan, the forest just… stitched.”

“Explain,” I said, though I didn’t want the explanation.

Mara whispered, “The ridge line moved. It slid like fabric. There’s a seam.”

A seam.

That was the word.

I looked at the map, at the contour lines, at the bowls nested inside bowls. They had always looked like folded fabric, but I had never considered the possibility that they might actually behave like it.

Drew’s voice came again. “Base, rope tension changed.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s heavier,” Drew said, and I could hear the strain in his breathing. “Like someone grabbed the other end, but not Caleb. Like… like the rope is going somewhere else.”

“Caleb,” I said urgently, “are you holding the rope?”

“Yes,” Caleb whispered, but his voice sounded distant now, muffled, as if he’d stepped underwater. “Evan… I can see the trailhead from here.”

“That’s impossible,” I said, and the words felt useless.

Caleb continued, voice trembling. “I can see Jillian’s car. I can see you. You’re all standing by the trailer. You’re… you’re looking at maps. You’re…”

His breathing hitched. “Evan, you’re sitting at the table, and you’re also walking into the trees.”

My heart hammered once, hard.

I wasn’t in the woods. I hadn’t left the trailer.

I had been at the trailer the whole time.

I tightened my grip on the microphone until my fingers ached.

“Caleb,” I said, forcing the words to sound like procedure, “tell me what I’m wearing.”

Caleb’s voice became oddly calm, like someone who has stopped trying to fight the shape of things.

“You’re wearing your red search jacket,” he said. “The one with the tape on the shoulder. You have a coffee stain on the chest, and you don’t notice it until later.”

A cold wave rolled through me.

I looked down at my jacket.

Red. Search patch. Tape on the shoulder from a repair I’d never bothered to redo properly.

And a coffee stain, dark and crescent-shaped, right where my hand had been resting, hidden by the map until this moment.

I had spilled coffee on myself this morning. I hadn’t looked down.

Caleb’s voice went softer. “Evan… the rope is… it’s going into the water, but the water is… it’s like it has depth that doesn’t belong to it.”

Drew swore under his breath, and then his voice snapped back into professionalism like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

“Base, we’re seeing the rope line sink.”

“Sinking?” I repeated.

“It’s going down,” Drew said, and his breathing was harsh. “Not into the creek. Into… into the reflection.”

Into the reflection.

Option three, the misalignment, made real in my mind like a nightmare deciding to obey the laws of physics just long enough to hurt you.

Jillian stood up abruptly, chair scraping. “Caleb!” she shouted, and her voice cracked. “Caleb, I’m here!”

Caleb responded immediately, but his words weren’t to her. They were to me, and they were barely more than a breath.

“Evan,” he said, “I can hear you calling my name from earlier.”

My mouth went dry. “Earlier today?”

Caleb’s voice trembled. “No. Earlier than today. It’s… it’s like the sound has been waiting here.”

A sound waiting.

A call that arrived before it was made.

I thought of the 4:18 timestamp sitting in Jillian’s app like a fixed point, like a nail hammered into time.

I thought of the breadcrumb gaps, the coordinate jumps, the duplicated teams on ridges.

I thought of Mara’s seam.

I forced myself to do the only thing I knew how to do when the world stopped behaving; I tried to simplify.

“Drew,” I said, “do not pull. Keep rope tension steady. Caleb, do not step forward. Do not step back. If you can, sit.”

Caleb whispered, “I already did.”

Then, in the background, under the hiss, under the creek sound that should not have carried through a radio, I heard something that made my blood turn to ice.

My own voice.

Not live, not from the trailer, but thin and distorted like it had been recorded on cheap tape.

“Caleb,” the recorded Evan said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator.”

It was the exact phrase I had used earlier, the same cadence, the same professional calm.

Only the timestamp in Jillian’s app flickered, and for a split second it read **4:18 PM**, then **4:18 PM** again, as if it couldn’t decide which reality it wanted to belong to.

Casey’s eyes were wide, wet with terror she hadn’t let herself feel yet.

“What is happening,” she mouthed.

And outside the trailer, somewhere beyond the parking lot, beyond the first mile of trail, beyond the bowls folding into themselves like hands closing, the radio cracked once more and Caleb whispered the last thing I ever heard him say, a sentence that sounded like a man realizing he had already crossed a line he never saw.

“It’s closing,” he said softly, “but it’s closing around the part of me that already came back, and I can feel the distance pulling like a muscle, and Evan, I think I’m about to arrive where I started, except when I look at the trailhead now, the trailer is already packed up, Jillian is already gone, and you’re walking into the trees with my red beanie in your hand like you-”",1,1769481752.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1qo1fp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qo1fp0/where_the_distance_collapsed/,Where the Distance Collapsed,"My name is **Evan Alder**, and for the last twelve years I’ve been the person people call when someone doesn’t come home.

That’s not a poetic way of putting it. It’s the job description, just without the bullet points.

Search and Rescue work is mostly arithmetic; time, distance, elevation gain, weather windows, daylight. We turn lives into numbers because numbers are honest, and because hope, by itself, is not a plan. I’ve coordinated everything from sprained ankles to late-season hypothermia to recoveries no one says out loud until you’re back at the command trailer and the radios finally go quiet.

I’ve learned what fear looks like on paper.

It shows up as missed check-ins, wrong trailheads, a vehicle that’s still warm in the parking lot, a water bottle left behind like it fell out of a hand that didn’t have time to close.

This one started with a single sentence from dispatch that I didn’t like the sound of.

“Missing hiker,” the deputy said over the phone, “and his last known location doesn’t make sense.”

That was what he led with, as if that kind of thing was rare.

It was a Tuesday in early fall, one of those sharp mornings where the air looks clean enough to drink. The first frost hadn’t hit yet, but the nights were cold, and the trees were already deciding what to keep.

The missing hiker was named **Caleb Rourke**, thirty-two, software engineer from the city, weekend backpacker. His girlfriend, **Jillian Park**, called it in when he didn’t answer her texts by nightfall. That part was normal. His vehicle was at the south trailhead of a backcountry network the locals just called *the bowls*, because the terrain folded into itself in a series of steep drainages and rounded ridgelines. You could be two miles from your car and still feel like you’d been swallowed.

The deputy’s issue was Caleb’s phone location. Jillian had shared it through one of those “find my” apps, desperate and practical at the same time. The dot wasn’t hovering over the parking lot or the first mile of trail. It was deep. Too deep for a day hike unless you were moving with purpose.

And the timestamp attached to the last ping made it worse.

The last location update came in at **4:18 PM**, and it put Caleb nearly **eight miles in**, past the second bowl and close to a ridge that took most people half a day to reach even with a light pack.

Jillian insisted he’d planned a short loop. Four miles, maybe five, back before dark. She’d said it through tears, but she’d said it with certainty.

Eight miles in by 4:18, and then nothing. No movement. No further pings.

It looked like he’d stopped.

In our world, stopping is what kills you.

By the time I drove up to the trailhead, my incident kit was already sitting on the passenger seat like a weight. Maps, flagging tape, extra batteries, laminated grid overlays, spare radio mic. I parked beside the deputy’s SUV and found Jillian on the tailgate, clutching a phone so hard her knuckles had bleached.

She looked up when I approached. Her eyes were raw like she’d been swimming in something abrasive.

“I can show you,” she said immediately, as if I might not believe her.

I introduced myself, and she gave a jerky nod. Jillian was in her late twenties, hair pulled into a messy knot, wearing running shoes that had never seen dirt. She was trying to be a person who could handle this.

The deputy, **Mark Denton**, stood nearby with his arms folded, watching the tree line like he expected it to move.

Jillian shoved the screen toward me.

The dot was exactly where Mark had described it. Deep in the bowls, pinned to a tight contour section that the map labeled with nothing but elevation lines stacked like teeth. A place that didn’t have a name, which meant it wasn’t a place most people went on purpose.

I asked the questions I always ask.

“What time did he leave?”

“Ten forty. Maybe ten fifty.”

“What was he wearing?”

“Gray jacket. Blue pack. He has a red beanie. He always wears it.”

“Experience level?”

“He hikes a lot. He’s not stupid.”

Nobody is stupid until they are cold, alone, and trying to make the world behave.

“Any medical issues?”

She shook her head. “He… he had a GPS app. He had a battery pack. He was excited. He said he wanted to get away from screens for once, which was… funny, because he literally builds them.”

She tried to laugh, and it broke halfway out.

I looked at the map again. Eight miles in. The dot was static. If Caleb had stopped because he’d twisted an ankle, he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he’d gotten lost and decided to “wait it out,” he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he couldn’t move, then we were already late.

I started the operation.

Within an hour we had our command trailer set up, our whiteboard filled with names and assignments, and a half-dozen volunteers arriving in dusty trucks. Our team is a patchwork of professions; nurses, mechanics, a high school math teacher, a guy who runs a towing company, a retired firefighter who still wears his old station jacket like armor.

I called in **Tessa Wynn**, our logistics lead, who could run a staging area like an airport. I called **Luis Ortega**, our best tracker, whose eyes didn’t miss broken fern stems or a scuffed rock. I called **Casey Harlow**, our comms specialist, who had the kind of calm voice that made frightened people breathe slower.

By noon, we had two hasty teams ready to deploy, and one technical team on standby in case we had to rope down into one of the bowls.

The plan was straightforward; you always start by assuming the world is normal.

Team One would head toward Caleb’s last known ping location along the main trail, then cut into the first drainage and work their way up. Team Two would approach from the east ridge and look down into the bowls from above, scanning for movement, color, any sign of a pack or a person. If we found a track, Luis would take it. If we found evidence, we’d expand the search.

I briefed everyone, and I watched their faces as I pointed at the map. They were listening, but I could see the subtle shift when I mentioned the distance.

Eight miles. Steep terrain. Late afternoon ping. No movement.

We were all doing the same math.

Casey ran radio checks. Everything came back clean.

“Tessa to Base, radio check.”

“Base to Tessa, loud and clear.”

“Luis to Base, check.”

“Base to Luis, loud and clear.”

Team One moved out first. I stayed at base with Casey and Tessa, monitoring, updating, and keeping the operation’s shape intact. That’s what incident coordinators do; we don’t chase, we direct. We keep the puzzle pieces from turning into scattered debris.

At **1:12 PM**, Team One called their first check-in. They’d reached the first junction, exactly as expected.

At **1:47 PM**, Team Two checked in from the ridge approach, moving steadily, no visual on Caleb.

At **2:09 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One. We’ve got sign.”

My spine tightened.

“Go ahead.”

“Fresh boot scuffs off the main trail, about a mile and a half in. Not on the map, not a social trail either. It’s like he stepped off on purpose.”

“Any other prints?”

“Hard to tell. Soil’s dry. But there’s a consistent scuff pattern, same tread. Looks like a trail runner, not a boot.”

That matched Jillian’s description. Running shoes.

Luis added, “He’s moving fast, or he was. The scuffs are long, like he was taking big strides.”

I wrote it on the board. Unplanned off-trail. Fast movement.

“Track it,” I said. “Mark it. Keep comms tight.”

“Copy.”

Normal so far. People step off trail. They follow game paths, they chase a view, they think they can shortcut. Eighty percent of our rescues begin with someone deciding the map is optional.

At **2:42 PM**, the first inconsistency arrived like a stone through glass.

“Base, this is Team One.”

I recognized the voice; **Drew Calhoun**, steady, competent. “Go ahead, Team One.”

“We’re… we’re at the creek crossing.”

I frowned. The creek crossing was three miles in, not one and a half. “Confirm location.”

Drew exhaled. “Creek crossing. It’s the one with the fallen log, the wide bend. We’ve got the rock outcrop on the left, and the dead snag on the right, same as the map notes.”

I looked at the map. I looked at the clock. Team One left base at 12:55. It was 2:42. That was one hour and forty-seven minutes.

To reach that creek crossing in under two hours, they would’ve had to jog, and even then it didn’t make sense with packs.

“Drew,” I said carefully, “what pace are you moving?”

A pause. “Normal. We’re not pushing. Terrain’s been… easier than I remember.”

“Easier,” Casey mouthed, watching me.

I pushed my thumb against the map edge as if the paper might correct itself.

“Any chance you took the wrong fork?” I asked.

“No,” Drew said, and the way he said it made my stomach drop. He sounded offended, but not because I’d questioned him. Because the question itself didn’t fit what he was seeing.

He added, “We passed the junction, we confirmed it. We’re on the right trail. Evan, we’re where we are.”

There are moments in this job where you choose between arguing with reality and adapting to it. I didn’t know which one this was.

“Copy,” I said. “Hold for a minute. I’m going to cross-check.”

I muted my mic and looked at Casey. “Check their last GPS breadcrumb,” I said. “The team unit, not their phones.”

Casey pulled up the tracking dashboard. Each team carried a shared GPS unit that dropped points at intervals. It wasn’t fancy, but it was reliable.

Her eyes narrowed. “That’s… weird.”

“What?”

“They’re showing at the creek crossing,” she said, “but their breadcrumb trail isn’t continuous. There’s a gap.”

“How big?”

Casey zoomed. “Two miles. One point is near the junction, then the next point is… just past the creek.”

I stared. A gap like that meant the unit had lost signal, or been turned off. But the forest wasn’t dense enough for a complete blackout, and Drew wasn’t sloppy.

“Ask if they powered down,” I said.

Casey keyed up. “Team One, Base. Confirm GPS unit status. Any power loss, battery swap, or shutdown?”

Drew replied immediately. “Negative. Unit’s been on the whole time.”

Casey looked at me. In the trailer, the radio hiss filled the silence between our breaths.

I told myself it was a glitch. Satellite drift. Device error. The kind of thing that happens and gets blamed on trees and terrain.

Then Luis called again.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go ahead.”

“You’re not going to like this,” Luis said, and his voice had lost its normal calm.

I sat forward. “Say it.”

“I was tracking the scuffs. They led me down into the first drainage, then… they just stop.”

“Stop like on rock?”

“No. Stop like someone picked him up and set him down somewhere else. The scuff pattern ends at a flat patch of dirt. No pivot, no stumble, no turnaround. Just… ends.”

The image formed in my mind; a line drawn, then cut clean.

Luis continued, “I found a water bottle. Clear plastic. Still cold, like it hasn’t been sitting in the sun long.”

My pulse thudded once, hard.

“Is it his?” I asked.

“There’s a sticker on it,” Luis said. “A tech company logo. A rocket.”

Jillian had mentioned he worked in software. People put their identity on their gear now, like we’re all branded.

“Bag it,” I said. “Mark location.”

Luis hesitated. “Evan… that location is wrong.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m looking at the map. I’m standing where the scuffs ended. This should be a steep section. It should be brush and loose rock. But it’s flat, like a shelf. Like the hillside got shaved off.”

I rubbed my forehead. A flat shelf in the drainage. Not impossible, but unusual.

“Send coordinates,” I said.

Casey took them and plotted. Her brows lifted.

“That’s not in the drainage,” she said quietly. “That’s… that’s closer to Bowl Two.”

Bowl Two was miles away.

I stared at the screen. “Maybe the coordinate format is wrong.”

Casey shook her head. “No. It’s correct.”

I keyed up. “Luis, confirm you’re seeing the first drainage. Confirm landmarks.”

Luis answered with the impatience of a man being asked whether the sky was above him.

“I can see the junction ridge behind me. I can hear the creek from Bowl One. I’m in Bowl One.”

“Copy,” I said, and my mouth went dry. “Hold.”

I turned to Tessa. “How many teams are out?”

“Two,” she said. “Plus Luis with his partner, **Mara Keene**.”

Mara was a paramedic who tracked with Luis because she was stubborn and fast and didn’t panic. If anything went wrong, Mara was the kind of person who would tie your life to hers without asking.

I breathed out slowly and tried to impose order.

“Okay,” I said. “We have three anomalies; Team One is ahead of schedule, Team One’s GPS breadcrumb has a gap, Luis is physically in one place but his coordinates plot in another.”

Casey looked pale. “Could be device error across the board.”

“Across different devices,” I said. “Different satellites, different users.”

In the field, when multiple instruments disagree, you default to the simplest explanation; human mistake. Misread junction, wrong ridge, miskeyed coordinate.

But Drew wasn’t a rookie. Luis was allergic to sloppy data. Casey’s equipment was checked and double-checked.

And then the radios picked up a voice that shouldn’t have been there at all.

It came over the search frequency, weak and crackling, like someone talking through a mouthful of water.

“Base… this is Caleb.”

Every hair on my arms stood up.

Casey’s eyes snapped to mine, and for a second neither of us moved. In the trailer, even the heater fan seemed too loud.

“Say again,” I said into the mic, and I hated how steady my voice sounded. I hated that it didn’t sound surprised, as if some part of me had already been expecting it.

The voice came again, clearer, and it made my stomach turn because it sounded tired.

“Base, this is Caleb. I’m… I’m at the creek. I can see the log. I can’t… I can’t find the trail back. It’s not—”

The signal broke into static.

I stared at the radio like it might grow hands and explain itself.

Casey whispered, “That’s not possible. We don’t have his frequency.”

We didn’t. Caleb wasn’t carrying one of our radios. Jillian hadn’t mentioned any handheld. Even if he had a cheap FRS set, he wouldn’t be on our channel unless he’d somehow matched it by accident.

Team One was at the creek crossing. Drew had just said so.

And now a voice claiming to be Caleb was saying he was at the creek crossing, unable to find the trail back.

“Drew,” I said immediately, “Team One, did you just transmit on search frequency?”

“No,” Drew replied, too fast. “We didn’t transmit. We’re holding. Evan, we’re… we’re hearing it too.”

“Copy,” I said.

The radio hissed. The forest outside remained indifferent.

I keyed up again, careful with the words. “Caleb, this is Base. If you can hear me, say your full name and describe what you see.”

Static. Then, faintly, “Caleb Rourke. There’s… water. The log. The dead tree. Someone’s yelling, but it’s… it’s like it’s far away even though it’s right there.”

His breath hitched, and the sound that followed was not a sob, not exactly, but the noise someone makes when they realize the world has stopped following rules.

“I can see the trail,” he whispered. “It’s right there. It’s right there, and it’s not…”

Static swallowed the rest.

Casey’s fingers flew over her console. “Signal origin,” she muttered. “Come on.”

She pulled up the directional antenna readings from our command unit. It gave a rough bearing when a transmission hit strong enough.

The bearing arrow pointed dead ahead.

Straight into the bowls.

I glanced at the map again. If Caleb’s last phone ping was near the second bowl, and he was now transmitting from the creek crossing, and Team One was already at the creek crossing, then either Caleb had doubled back faster than physics allowed, or someone was spoofing us, or we were hearing a recording.

Or, and I didn’t want to think it, the creek crossing wasn’t one place anymore.

I made a decision that felt like stepping onto ice.

“Team One,” I said, “approach the creek crossing slowly. Call out. Do not cross the log. Confirm if you hear a voice in person.”

Drew’s voice came back, low. “Copy.”

I switched channels to Luis. “Luis, Mara, I need you to move toward the creek crossing, but do it cautiously. Flag your route. If you lose visual on each other, stop.”

Mara answered instead of Luis, her voice clipped. “Copy, Evan. We’re moving.”

Tessa stepped closer to me, her face serious. “Do we call in more assets?”

“Not yet,” I said, though my stomach wanted to say yes to anything that felt like control. “Let’s verify before we escalate.”

The truth is, escalation in wilderness operations is still just people walking. More boots, more radio chatter, more fatigue. If something was wrong with distance itself, then adding more bodies might just add more variables.

I watched the clock.

At **3:18 PM**, Team One came back.

“Base,” Drew said, and his voice was different. Not panicked, but careful, like he’d stepped into a room where someone had been arguing.

“We’re at the creek.”

“Copy. Visual contact with subject?”

Silence, then: “Negative.”

“Do you hear anything?”

Another pause. “We can hear someone breathing. Not like… not like near us. Like it’s coming from the creek itself.”

I felt cold crawl up my ribs.

“Drew,” I said, “describe what you mean.”

He swallowed audibly. “It’s like the sound is inside the water. Like when you put your head under and you can hear the world muffled. That kind of sound. But the creek isn’t loud enough to hide it.”

Casey shook her head slowly, as if refusing.

Drew continued, “We called out. No response in person. But… Evan, the radio.”

“Go on.”

“It’s answering us,” he said, and the way he said it made my mouth go dry. “When we call out, the radio transmits back, but it’s delayed. Like an echo, except it’s words.”

My thoughts snagged on a memory of training; radio reflections, signal bounce, weird atmospheric conditions. But this wasn’t a mountain repeating static. This was language.

Casey leaned toward the mic. “Team One, ask the voice what time it is.”

Drew didn’t argue. He keyed up.

“Caleb,” Drew said, steady, like he was talking to a frightened person on a ledge. “What time is it?”

Static. Then, faint and breathy, Caleb’s voice.

“Four eighteen.”

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like I’d missed a step.

That was the time of the last phone ping.

Drew’s voice shook slightly. “Base, did you hear that?”

“I heard it,” I said.

Casey stared at her console as if it might confess.

Four eighteen. The last timestamp. The moment Caleb had stopped moving, at least as far as Jillian’s app could tell.

But it was barely past three now.

I forced myself to speak. “Drew, do not cross the log. Mark the area. Look for physical evidence; gear, clothing, tracks. Anything.”

“Copy,” Drew said, and I could tell he was relieved to be given tasks. Tasks are walls we build against the dark.

I turned to Casey. “Pull Jillian’s phone logs. Every ping. Every timestamp. I want the last hour in detail.”

Casey nodded, fingers moving.

Tessa looked at me. “Evan, what is this?”

I stared at the map, at the contour lines stacked tight where the land folded into bowls like hands closing.

“Either we’re dealing with technology error,” I said, and my voice sounded too small for the trailer, “or we’re dealing with a location that isn’t behaving like a location.”

At **3:41 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go.”

Luis’s voice was low, and it carried that tone he used when he’d found something he didn’t want to name.

“We found a second bottle,” he said. “Same sticker. Same model. Same cap bite marks.”

“That’s impossible,” Casey whispered.

Luis added, “And Evan… it’s warm.”

Warm meant recently held. Warm meant skin contact.

“Location?” I asked.

Luis hesitated. “That’s the problem. It’s on the ridge above Bowl Two.”

“That’s miles from you,” I said.

“I know,” Luis replied, and he sounded angry now, angry the way a person sounds when their senses are being insulted. “We haven’t climbed. We’ve been moving downhill toward the creek. We should not be on any ridge.”

Mara cut in, her voice tight. “Evan, the trees changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“They’re wrong,” Mara said. “Same forest, but different. The moss is on the wrong side. The deadfall patterns aren’t consistent. It’s like we’re walking through a copy that got… arranged by someone who didn’t understand it.”

Her breathing was controlled, but I could hear the effort.

Luis’s voice came back. “We can see the creek below us, but it’s too far down. It wasn’t like this ten minutes ago.”

I pressed the heel of my hand to my forehead. “Stop moving. Flag your position. Take a bearing. Confirm with GPS.”

Casey’s console beeped softly. She looked at the screen, then at me, then back again.

“Evan,” she whispered, “Luis’s unit just jumped.”

“How far?”

She swallowed. “Three point two miles. In one update interval.”

No one covers three miles in thirty seconds.

I took the mic. “Luis, Mara, do you see the creek?”

“Yes,” Mara said quickly. “But it’s… it’s not lining up with the sound. It looks close, but it sounds far. The distance doesn’t match the way it feels.”

The words landed with a sick certainty.

Distance doesn’t match the way it feels.

That was not a technology error. That was a symptom.

I made another decision, and it tasted like metal.

“Luis,” I said, “do you have line of sight to the creek crossing log?”

A pause, then: “We might. It’s… hard to tell. The view is wrong.”

“Do not descend,” I said. “Hold where you are. Keep each other in sight. I’m sending Team Two to your bearing to establish a visual anchor.”

Team Two, led by **Nina Cho**, was on the ridge approach. If they could see Luis and Mara from above, then we could triangulate and restore reality through geometry.

At least, that’s what my brain told itself.

At **4:02 PM**, Jillian returned to the command trailer. Tessa had kept her occupied, fed her water, done the human things while I did the operational ones.

Jillian’s face was gray with exhaustion, but her eyes were bright with a desperate kind of focus.

“Any news?” she asked.

I weighed my words. You never lie to family. You also don’t hand them raw fear.

“We’re getting signals,” I said carefully. “We’re working toward a confirmation.”

She stepped closer. “His phone updated.”

Casey looked up sharply. “What?”

Jillian held out her phone. The dot had moved.

It was now at the creek crossing.

The timestamp said **4:18 PM**.

My blood went cold.

It was 4:03.

Jillian stared at me like I was the one who had done it. “How is it four eighteen?”

“It’s not,” I said, and the way the words came out, flat and absolute, seemed to frighten her more than any comforting lie could have.

Casey grabbed the phone, checked the network, checked the time settings. The phone time was correct. The app time was correct.

Only the location ping was wrong.

Or it was right, and our definition of “now” was the thing that had drifted.

The radio crackled again, and Caleb’s voice returned, clearer than before, like someone stepping closer to a window.

“Base,” he said, and he sounded calmer, which was worse. “I can see you.”

I froze.

Drew’s voice came instantly. “Caleb, where are you? We don’t see you.”

Caleb whispered, “You’re right there.”

Casey’s eyes darted to me, wide.

Caleb continued, and his voice had the dazed quality of someone describing something they didn’t have words for.

“I’m at the creek,” he said. “I’m on the log. I’m looking at all of you. You’re not… you’re not standing where you are.”

Drew’s voice sharpened. “Caleb, step off the log. Step back.”

A pause, then Caleb’s quiet, bewildered answer.

“I can’t. The log is longer than it should be.”

The trailer felt too small suddenly, as if the walls had moved closer.

Jillian made a sound behind me, a strangled breath.

I took the mic, because I needed my voice in the system, needed an anchor.

“Caleb,” I said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator. Listen to me carefully. Do you see the water? Do you see the dead snag on the right side?”

“Yes,” he said, and his voice shook at the edges. “But it’s… it’s looping. The water keeps meeting itself.”

I closed my eyes for a second, just long enough to feel the weight of my own heartbeat.

When I opened them, Casey was watching me like she was waiting for permission to be afraid.

“Caleb,” I said, “I need you to tell me something only you and Jillian would know.”

Jillian leaned forward, trembling.

Caleb’s voice came softly. “We went to that ramen place, the one with the paper lanterns. She made me try the soft egg even though I said it looked weird.”

Jillian’s hand flew to her mouth. Tears spilled instantly, silent and unstoppable.

It was him.

It was him, and he was talking to us from a place where the creek met itself and time was a circle you could step onto.

My mind tried to salvage a plan.

“Drew,” I said, “Team One, extend a line. Throw a rope to the log, but do not cross. Keep tension light. We’re not pulling. We’re giving him an anchor.”

Drew answered, “Copy.”

I switched to Team Two. “Nina, I need you to establish visual on Luis and Mara. Confirm if you can see their exact position. Give me bearings.”

“Copy,” Nina replied.

Everything moved at once after that, like we’d kicked a hive.

Team One secured a rope to a tree, tossed the coil. Drew narrated, voice tight but professional. The rope landed near the log.

“Caleb,” Drew called, “reach for the rope. Tie it around your waist if you can.”

Caleb’s breathing came through the radio like a tide. “It’s… it’s closer on your side than mine.”

“Reach anyway,” Drew said.

There was a sound then, a faint scraping, as if fabric had dragged across wood.

“I have it,” Caleb whispered, and Jillian sobbed aloud behind me, raw and involuntary.

Drew’s relief came through in a single exhale. “Good. Hold it. Don’t move.”

Caleb’s voice was suddenly very small. “Drew,” he said.

“How do you know my name?” Drew snapped, and then immediately sounded regretful.

Caleb didn’t answer the question. “Drew,” he said again, “you’re standing behind yourself.”

Drew went silent.

Then, in the background of Drew’s transmission, I heard something else, faint but unmistakable.

Another voice.

Drew’s voice, delayed, like an echo that had learned how to speak.

“Team One to Base,” the delayed voice said, “we’re at the creek crossing.”

Casey stared at me, horrified.

The radio was not bouncing. It was repeating, but not as a loop. As a second channel of reality that was slightly out of phase.

Nina called in, and her voice was sharp enough to cut.

“Base, Team Two. We have visual on Luis and Mara.”

“Copy,” I said quickly. “Confirm their position.”

There was a pause that felt like the air holding its breath.

Nina’s voice returned, lower. “Evan… we have visual on Luis and Mara, but…”

“But what?”

“There are two pairs,” she said, and the words came out like she didn’t want her mouth to form them. “Two positions. Same clothing. Same movements. Like a delayed mirror.”

My hands went numb on the map.

In the trailer, Jillian was shaking so hard the chair beneath her rattled.

I keyed up to Luis. “Luis, do you hear Team Two? They have visual on you.”

Luis’s response was immediate. “We can see them too,” he said, and his voice sounded strained, as if he’d been holding something heavy for too long. “But… Evan, there’s another Team Two.”

My stomach lurched.

Mara’s voice came, soft and urgent. “Evan, the forest just… stitched.”

“Explain,” I said, though I didn’t want the explanation.

Mara whispered, “The ridge line moved. It slid like fabric. There’s a seam.”

A seam.

That was the word.

I looked at the map, at the contour lines, at the bowls nested inside bowls. They had always looked like folded fabric, but I had never considered the possibility that they might actually behave like it.

Drew’s voice came again. “Base, rope tension changed.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s heavier,” Drew said, and I could hear the strain in his breathing. “Like someone grabbed the other end, but not Caleb. Like… like the rope is going somewhere else.”

“Caleb,” I said urgently, “are you holding the rope?”

“Yes,” Caleb whispered, but his voice sounded distant now, muffled, as if he’d stepped underwater. “Evan… I can see the trailhead from here.”

“That’s impossible,” I said, and the words felt useless.

Caleb continued, voice trembling. “I can see Jillian’s car. I can see you. You’re all standing by the trailer. You’re… you’re looking at maps. You’re…”

His breathing hitched. “Evan, you’re sitting at the table, and you’re also walking into the trees.”

My heart hammered once, hard.

I wasn’t in the woods. I hadn’t left the trailer.

I had been at the trailer the whole time.

I tightened my grip on the microphone until my fingers ached.

“Caleb,” I said, forcing the words to sound like procedure, “tell me what I’m wearing.”

Caleb’s voice became oddly calm, like someone who has stopped trying to fight the shape of things.

“You’re wearing your red search jacket,” he said. “The one with the tape on the shoulder. You have a coffee stain on the chest, and you don’t notice it until later.”

A cold wave rolled through me.

I looked down at my jacket.

Red. Search patch. Tape on the shoulder from a repair I’d never bothered to redo properly.

And a coffee stain, dark and crescent-shaped, right where my hand had been resting, hidden by the map until this moment.

I had spilled coffee on myself this morning. I hadn’t looked down.

Caleb’s voice went softer. “Evan… the rope is… it’s going into the water, but the water is… it’s like it has depth that doesn’t belong to it.”

Drew swore under his breath, and then his voice snapped back into professionalism like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

“Base, we’re seeing the rope line sink.”

“Sinking?” I repeated.

“It’s going down,” Drew said, and his breathing was harsh. “Not into the creek. Into… into the reflection.”

Into the reflection.

Option three, the misalignment, made real in my mind like a nightmare deciding to obey the laws of physics just long enough to hurt you.

Jillian stood up abruptly, chair scraping. “Caleb!” she shouted, and her voice cracked. “Caleb, I’m here!”

Caleb responded immediately, but his words weren’t to her. They were to me, and they were barely more than a breath.

“Evan,” he said, “I can hear you calling my name from earlier.”

My mouth went dry. “Earlier today?”

Caleb’s voice trembled. “No. Earlier than today. It’s… it’s like the sound has been waiting here.”

A sound waiting.

A call that arrived before it was made.

I thought of the 4:18 timestamp sitting in Jillian’s app like a fixed point, like a nail hammered into time.

I thought of the breadcrumb gaps, the coordinate jumps, the duplicated teams on ridges.

I thought of Mara’s seam.

I forced myself to do the only thing I knew how to do when the world stopped behaving; I tried to simplify.

“Drew,” I said, “do not pull. Keep rope tension steady. Caleb, do not step forward. Do not step back. If you can, sit.”

Caleb whispered, “I already did.”

Then, in the background, under the hiss, under the creek sound that should not have carried through a radio, I heard something that made my blood turn to ice.

My own voice.

Not live, not from the trailer, but thin and distorted like it had been recorded on cheap tape.

“Caleb,” the recorded Evan said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator.”

It was the exact phrase I had used earlier, the same cadence, the same professional calm.

Only the timestamp in Jillian’s app flickered, and for a split second it read **4:18 PM**, then **4:18 PM** again, as if it couldn’t decide which reality it wanted to belong to.

Casey’s eyes were wide, wet with terror she hadn’t let herself feel yet.

“What is happening,” she mouthed.

And outside the trailer, somewhere beyond the parking lot, beyond the first mile of trail, beyond the bowls folding into themselves like hands closing, the radio cracked once more and Caleb whispered the last thing I ever heard him say, a sentence that sounded like a man realizing he had already crossed a line he never saw.

“It’s closing,” he said softly, “but it’s closing around the part of me that already came back, and I can feel the distance pulling like a muscle, and Evan, I think I’m about to arrive where I started, except when I look at the trailhead now, the trailer is already packed up, Jillian is already gone, and you’re walking into the trees with my red beanie in your hand like you-”",2,1769481727.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

That’s not a poetic way of putting it. It’s the job description, just without the bullet points.

Search and Rescue work is mostly arithmetic; time, distance, elevation gain, weather windows, daylight. We turn lives into numbers because numbers are honest, and because hope, by itself, is not a plan. I’ve coordinated everything from sprained ankles to late-season hypothermia to recoveries no one says out loud until you’re back at the command trailer and the radios finally go quiet.

I’ve learned what fear looks like on paper.

It shows up as missed check-ins, wrong trailheads, a vehicle that’s still warm in the parking lot, a water bottle left behind like it fell out of a hand that didn’t have time to close.

This one started with a single sentence from dispatch that I didn’t like the sound of.

“Missing hiker,” the deputy said over the phone, “and his last known location doesn’t make sense.”

That was what he led with, as if that kind of thing was rare.

It was a Tuesday in early fall, one of those sharp mornings where the air looks clean enough to drink. The first frost hadn’t hit yet, but the nights were cold, and the trees were already deciding what to keep.

The missing hiker was named **Caleb Rourke**, thirty-two, software engineer from the city, weekend backpacker. His girlfriend, **Jillian Park**, called it in when he didn’t answer her texts by nightfall. That part was normal. His vehicle was at the south trailhead of a backcountry network the locals just called *the bowls*, because the terrain folded into itself in a series of steep drainages and rounded ridgelines. You could be two miles from your car and still feel like you’d been swallowed.

The deputy’s issue was Caleb’s phone location. Jillian had shared it through one of those “find my” apps, desperate and practical at the same time. The dot wasn’t hovering over the parking lot or the first mile of trail. It was deep. Too deep for a day hike unless you were moving with purpose.

And the timestamp attached to the last ping made it worse.

The last location update came in at **4:18 PM**, and it put Caleb nearly **eight miles in**, past the second bowl and close to a ridge that took most people half a day to reach even with a light pack.

Jillian insisted he’d planned a short loop. Four miles, maybe five, back before dark. She’d said it through tears, but she’d said it with certainty.

Eight miles in by 4:18, and then nothing. No movement. No further pings.

It looked like he’d stopped.

In our world, stopping is what kills you.

By the time I drove up to the trailhead, my incident kit was already sitting on the passenger seat like a weight. Maps, flagging tape, extra batteries, laminated grid overlays, spare radio mic. I parked beside the deputy’s SUV and found Jillian on the tailgate, clutching a phone so hard her knuckles had bleached.

She looked up when I approached. Her eyes were raw like she’d been swimming in something abrasive.

“I can show you,” she said immediately, as if I might not believe her.

I introduced myself, and she gave a jerky nod. Jillian was in her late twenties, hair pulled into a messy knot, wearing running shoes that had never seen dirt. She was trying to be a person who could handle this.

The deputy, **Mark Denton**, stood nearby with his arms folded, watching the tree line like he expected it to move.

Jillian shoved the screen toward me.

The dot was exactly where Mark had described it. Deep in the bowls, pinned to a tight contour section that the map labeled with nothing but elevation lines stacked like teeth. A place that didn’t have a name, which meant it wasn’t a place most people went on purpose.

I asked the questions I always ask.

“What time did he leave?”

“Ten forty. Maybe ten fifty.”

“What was he wearing?”

“Gray jacket. Blue pack. He has a red beanie. He always wears it.”

“Experience level?”

“He hikes a lot. He’s not stupid.”

Nobody is stupid until they are cold, alone, and trying to make the world behave.

“Any medical issues?”

She shook her head. “He… he had a GPS app. He had a battery pack. He was excited. He said he wanted to get away from screens for once, which was… funny, because he literally builds them.”

She tried to laugh, and it broke halfway out.

I looked at the map again. Eight miles in. The dot was static. If Caleb had stopped because he’d twisted an ankle, he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he’d gotten lost and decided to “wait it out,” he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he couldn’t move, then we were already late.

I started the operation.

Within an hour we had our command trailer set up, our whiteboard filled with names and assignments, and a half-dozen volunteers arriving in dusty trucks. Our team is a patchwork of professions; nurses, mechanics, a high school math teacher, a guy who runs a towing company, a retired firefighter who still wears his old station jacket like armor.

I called in **Tessa Wynn**, our logistics lead, who could run a staging area like an airport. I called **Luis Ortega**, our best tracker, whose eyes didn’t miss broken fern stems or a scuffed rock. I called **Casey Harlow**, our comms specialist, who had the kind of calm voice that made frightened people breathe slower.

By noon, we had two hasty teams ready to deploy, and one technical team on standby in case we had to rope down into one of the bowls.

The plan was straightforward; you always start by assuming the world is normal.

Team One would head toward Caleb’s last known ping location along the main trail, then cut into the first drainage and work their way up. Team Two would approach from the east ridge and look down into the bowls from above, scanning for movement, color, any sign of a pack or a person. If we found a track, Luis would take it. If we found evidence, we’d expand the search.

I briefed everyone, and I watched their faces as I pointed at the map. They were listening, but I could see the subtle shift when I mentioned the distance.

Eight miles. Steep terrain. Late afternoon ping. No movement.

We were all doing the same math.

Casey ran radio checks. Everything came back clean.

“Tessa to Base, radio check.”

“Base to Tessa, loud and clear.”

“Luis to Base, check.”

“Base to Luis, loud and clear.”

Team One moved out first. I stayed at base with Casey and Tessa, monitoring, updating, and keeping the operation’s shape intact. That’s what incident coordinators do; we don’t chase, we direct. We keep the puzzle pieces from turning into scattered debris.

At **1:12 PM**, Team One called their first check-in. They’d reached the first junction, exactly as expected.

At **1:47 PM**, Team Two checked in from the ridge approach, moving steadily, no visual on Caleb.

At **2:09 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One. We’ve got sign.”

My spine tightened.

“Go ahead.”

“Fresh boot scuffs off the main trail, about a mile and a half in. Not on the map, not a social trail either. It’s like he stepped off on purpose.”

“Any other prints?”

“Hard to tell. Soil’s dry. But there’s a consistent scuff pattern, same tread. Looks like a trail runner, not a boot.”

That matched Jillian’s description. Running shoes.

Luis added, “He’s moving fast, or he was. The scuffs are long, like he was taking big strides.”

I wrote it on the board. Unplanned off-trail. Fast movement.

“Track it,” I said. “Mark it. Keep comms tight.”

“Copy.”

Normal so far. People step off trail. They follow game paths, they chase a view, they think they can shortcut. Eighty percent of our rescues begin with someone deciding the map is optional.

At **2:42 PM**, the first inconsistency arrived like a stone through glass.

“Base, this is Team One.”

I recognized the voice; **Drew Calhoun**, steady, competent. “Go ahead, Team One.”

“We’re… we’re at the creek crossing.”

I frowned. The creek crossing was three miles in, not one and a half. “Confirm location.”

Drew exhaled. “Creek crossing. It’s the one with the fallen log, the wide bend. We’ve got the rock outcrop on the left, and the dead snag on the right, same as the map notes.”

I looked at the map. I looked at the clock. Team One left base at 12:55. It was 2:42. That was one hour and forty-seven minutes.

To reach that creek crossing in under two hours, they would’ve had to jog, and even then it didn’t make sense with packs.

“Drew,” I said carefully, “what pace are you moving?”

A pause. “Normal. We’re not pushing. Terrain’s been… easier than I remember.”

“Easier,” Casey mouthed, watching me.

I pushed my thumb against the map edge as if the paper might correct itself.

“Any chance you took the wrong fork?” I asked.

“No,” Drew said, and the way he said it made my stomach drop. He sounded offended, but not because I’d questioned him. Because the question itself didn’t fit what he was seeing.

He added, “We passed the junction, we confirmed it. We’re on the right trail. Evan, we’re where we are.”

There are moments in this job where you choose between arguing with reality and adapting to it. I didn’t know which one this was.

“Copy,” I said. “Hold for a minute. I’m going to cross-check.”

I muted my mic and looked at Casey. “Check their last GPS breadcrumb,” I said. “The team unit, not their phones.”

Casey pulled up the tracking dashboard. Each team carried a shared GPS unit that dropped points at intervals. It wasn’t fancy, but it was reliable.

Her eyes narrowed. “That’s… weird.”

“What?”

“They’re showing at the creek crossing,” she said, “but their breadcrumb trail isn’t continuous. There’s a gap.”

“How big?”

Casey zoomed. “Two miles. One point is near the junction, then the next point is… just past the creek.”

I stared. A gap like that meant the unit had lost signal, or been turned off. But the forest wasn’t dense enough for a complete blackout, and Drew wasn’t sloppy.

“Ask if they powered down,” I said.

Casey keyed up. “Team One, Base. Confirm GPS unit status. Any power loss, battery swap, or shutdown?”

Drew replied immediately. “Negative. Unit’s been on the whole time.”

Casey looked at me. In the trailer, the radio hiss filled the silence between our breaths.

I told myself it was a glitch. Satellite drift. Device error. The kind of thing that happens and gets blamed on trees and terrain.

Then Luis called again.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go ahead.”

“You’re not going to like this,” Luis said, and his voice had lost its normal calm.

I sat forward. “Say it.”

“I was tracking the scuffs. They led me down into the first drainage, then… they just stop.”

“Stop like on rock?”

“No. Stop like someone picked him up and set him down somewhere else. The scuff pattern ends at a flat patch of dirt. No pivot, no stumble, no turnaround. Just… ends.”

The image formed in my mind; a line drawn, then cut clean.

Luis continued, “I found a water bottle. Clear plastic. Still cold, like it hasn’t been sitting in the sun long.”

My pulse thudded once, hard.

“Is it his?” I asked.

“There’s a sticker on it,” Luis said. “A tech company logo. A rocket.”

Jillian had mentioned he worked in software. People put their identity on their gear now, like we’re all branded.

“Bag it,” I said. “Mark location.”

Luis hesitated. “Evan… that location is wrong.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m looking at the map. I’m standing where the scuffs ended. This should be a steep section. It should be brush and loose rock. But it’s flat, like a shelf. Like the hillside got shaved off.”

I rubbed my forehead. A flat shelf in the drainage. Not impossible, but unusual.

“Send coordinates,” I said.

Casey took them and plotted. Her brows lifted.

“That’s not in the drainage,” she said quietly. “That’s… that’s closer to Bowl Two.”

Bowl Two was miles away.

I stared at the screen. “Maybe the coordinate format is wrong.”

Casey shook her head. “No. It’s correct.”

I keyed up. “Luis, confirm you’re seeing the first drainage. Confirm landmarks.”

Luis answered with the impatience of a man being asked whether the sky was above him.

“I can see the junction ridge behind me. I can hear the creek from Bowl One. I’m in Bowl One.”

“Copy,” I said, and my mouth went dry. “Hold.”

I turned to Tessa. “How many teams are out?”

“Two,” she said. “Plus Luis with his partner, **Mara Keene**.”

Mara was a paramedic who tracked with Luis because she was stubborn and fast and didn’t panic. If anything went wrong, Mara was the kind of person who would tie your life to hers without asking.

I breathed out slowly and tried to impose order.

“Okay,” I said. “We have three anomalies; Team One is ahead of schedule, Team One’s GPS breadcrumb has a gap, Luis is physically in one place but his coordinates plot in another.”

Casey looked pale. “Could be device error across the board.”

“Across different devices,” I said. “Different satellites, different users.”

In the field, when multiple instruments disagree, you default to the simplest explanation; human mistake. Misread junction, wrong ridge, miskeyed coordinate.

But Drew wasn’t a rookie. Luis was allergic to sloppy data. Casey’s equipment was checked and double-checked.

And then the radios picked up a voice that shouldn’t have been there at all.

It came over the search frequency, weak and crackling, like someone talking through a mouthful of water.

“Base… this is Caleb.”

Every hair on my arms stood up.

Casey’s eyes snapped to mine, and for a second neither of us moved. In the trailer, even the heater fan seemed too loud.

“Say again,” I said into the mic, and I hated how steady my voice sounded. I hated that it didn’t sound surprised, as if some part of me had already been expecting it.

The voice came again, clearer, and it made my stomach turn because it sounded tired.

“Base, this is Caleb. I’m… I’m at the creek. I can see the log. I can’t… I can’t find the trail back. It’s not—”

The signal broke into static.

I stared at the radio like it might grow hands and explain itself.

Casey whispered, “That’s not possible. We don’t have his frequency.”

We didn’t. Caleb wasn’t carrying one of our radios. Jillian hadn’t mentioned any handheld. Even if he had a cheap FRS set, he wouldn’t be on our channel unless he’d somehow matched it by accident.

Team One was at the creek crossing. Drew had just said so.

And now a voice claiming to be Caleb was saying he was at the creek crossing, unable to find the trail back.

“Drew,” I said immediately, “Team One, did you just transmit on search frequency?”

“No,” Drew replied, too fast. “We didn’t transmit. We’re holding. Evan, we’re… we’re hearing it too.”

“Copy,” I said.

The radio hissed. The forest outside remained indifferent.

I keyed up again, careful with the words. “Caleb, this is Base. If you can hear me, say your full name and describe what you see.”

Static. Then, faintly, “Caleb Rourke. There’s… water. The log. The dead tree. Someone’s yelling, but it’s… it’s like it’s far away even though it’s right there.”

His breath hitched, and the sound that followed was not a sob, not exactly, but the noise someone makes when they realize the world has stopped following rules.

“I can see the trail,” he whispered. “It’s right there. It’s right there, and it’s not…”

Static swallowed the rest.

Casey’s fingers flew over her console. “Signal origin,” she muttered. “Come on.”

She pulled up the directional antenna readings from our command unit. It gave a rough bearing when a transmission hit strong enough.

The bearing arrow pointed dead ahead.

Straight into the bowls.

I glanced at the map again. If Caleb’s last phone ping was near the second bowl, and he was now transmitting from the creek crossing, and Team One was already at the creek crossing, then either Caleb had doubled back faster than physics allowed, or someone was spoofing us, or we were hearing a recording.

Or, and I didn’t want to think it, the creek crossing wasn’t one place anymore.

I made a decision that felt like stepping onto ice.

“Team One,” I said, “approach the creek crossing slowly. Call out. Do not cross the log. Confirm if you hear a voice in person.”

Drew’s voice came back, low. “Copy.”

I switched channels to Luis. “Luis, Mara, I need you to move toward the creek crossing, but do it cautiously. Flag your route. If you lose visual on each other, stop.”

Mara answered instead of Luis, her voice clipped. “Copy, Evan. We’re moving.”

Tessa stepped closer to me, her face serious. “Do we call in more assets?”

“Not yet,” I said, though my stomach wanted to say yes to anything that felt like control. “Let’s verify before we escalate.”

The truth is, escalation in wilderness operations is still just people walking. More boots, more radio chatter, more fatigue. If something was wrong with distance itself, then adding more bodies might just add more variables.

I watched the clock.

At **3:18 PM**, Team One came back.

“Base,” Drew said, and his voice was different. Not panicked, but careful, like he’d stepped into a room where someone had been arguing.

“We’re at the creek.”

“Copy. Visual contact with subject?”

Silence, then: “Negative.”

“Do you hear anything?”

Another pause. “We can hear someone breathing. Not like… not like near us. Like it’s coming from the creek itself.”

I felt cold crawl up my ribs.

“Drew,” I said, “describe what you mean.”

He swallowed audibly. “It’s like the sound is inside the water. Like when you put your head under and you can hear the world muffled. That kind of sound. But the creek isn’t loud enough to hide it.”

Casey shook her head slowly, as if refusing.

Drew continued, “We called out. No response in person. But… Evan, the radio.”

“Go on.”

“It’s answering us,” he said, and the way he said it made my mouth go dry. “When we call out, the radio transmits back, but it’s delayed. Like an echo, except it’s words.”

My thoughts snagged on a memory of training; radio reflections, signal bounce, weird atmospheric conditions. But this wasn’t a mountain repeating static. This was language.

Casey leaned toward the mic. “Team One, ask the voice what time it is.”

Drew didn’t argue. He keyed up.

“Caleb,” Drew said, steady, like he was talking to a frightened person on a ledge. “What time is it?”

Static. Then, faint and breathy, Caleb’s voice.

“Four eighteen.”

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like I’d missed a step.

That was the time of the last phone ping.

Drew’s voice shook slightly. “Base, did you hear that?”

“I heard it,” I said.

Casey stared at her console as if it might confess.

Four eighteen. The last timestamp. The moment Caleb had stopped moving, at least as far as Jillian’s app could tell.

But it was barely past three now.

I forced myself to speak. “Drew, do not cross the log. Mark the area. Look for physical evidence; gear, clothing, tracks. Anything.”

“Copy,” Drew said, and I could tell he was relieved to be given tasks. Tasks are walls we build against the dark.

I turned to Casey. “Pull Jillian’s phone logs. Every ping. Every timestamp. I want the last hour in detail.”

Casey nodded, fingers moving.

Tessa looked at me. “Evan, what is this?”

I stared at the map, at the contour lines stacked tight where the land folded into bowls like hands closing.

“Either we’re dealing with technology error,” I said, and my voice sounded too small for the trailer, “or we’re dealing with a location that isn’t behaving like a location.”

At **3:41 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go.”

Luis’s voice was low, and it carried that tone he used when he’d found something he didn’t want to name.

“We found a second bottle,” he said. “Same sticker. Same model. Same cap bite marks.”

“That’s impossible,” Casey whispered.

Luis added, “And Evan… it’s warm.”

Warm meant recently held. Warm meant skin contact.

“Location?” I asked.

Luis hesitated. “That’s the problem. It’s on the ridge above Bowl Two.”

“That’s miles from you,” I said.

“I know,” Luis replied, and he sounded angry now, angry the way a person sounds when their senses are being insulted. “We haven’t climbed. We’ve been moving downhill toward the creek. We should not be on any ridge.”

Mara cut in, her voice tight. “Evan, the trees changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“They’re wrong,” Mara said. “Same forest, but different. The moss is on the wrong side. The deadfall patterns aren’t consistent. It’s like we’re walking through a copy that got… arranged by someone who didn’t understand it.”

Her breathing was controlled, but I could hear the effort.

Luis’s voice came back. “We can see the creek below us, but it’s too far down. It wasn’t like this ten minutes ago.”

I pressed the heel of my hand to my forehead. “Stop moving. Flag your position. Take a bearing. Confirm with GPS.”

Casey’s console beeped softly. She looked at the screen, then at me, then back again.

“Evan,” she whispered, “Luis’s unit just jumped.”

“How far?”

She swallowed. “Three point two miles. In one update interval.”

No one covers three miles in thirty seconds.

I took the mic. “Luis, Mara, do you see the creek?”

“Yes,” Mara said quickly. “But it’s… it’s not lining up with the sound. It looks close, but it sounds far. The distance doesn’t match the way it feels.”

The words landed with a sick certainty.

Distance doesn’t match the way it feels.

That was not a technology error. That was a symptom.

I made another decision, and it tasted like metal.

“Luis,” I said, “do you have line of sight to the creek crossing log?”

A pause, then: “We might. It’s… hard to tell. The view is wrong.”

“Do not descend,” I said. “Hold where you are. Keep each other in sight. I’m sending Team Two to your bearing to establish a visual anchor.”

Team Two, led by **Nina Cho**, was on the ridge approach. If they could see Luis and Mara from above, then we could triangulate and restore reality through geometry.

At least, that’s what my brain told itself.

At **4:02 PM**, Jillian returned to the command trailer. Tessa had kept her occupied, fed her water, done the human things while I did the operational ones.

Jillian’s face was gray with exhaustion, but her eyes were bright with a desperate kind of focus.

“Any news?” she asked.

I weighed my words. You never lie to family. You also don’t hand them raw fear.

“We’re getting signals,” I said carefully. “We’re working toward a confirmation.”

She stepped closer. “His phone updated.”

Casey looked up sharply. “What?”

Jillian held out her phone. The dot had moved.

It was now at the creek crossing.

The timestamp said **4:18 PM**.

My blood went cold.

It was 4:03.

Jillian stared at me like I was the one who had done it. “How is it four eighteen?”

“It’s not,” I said, and the way the words came out, flat and absolute, seemed to frighten her more than any comforting lie could have.

Casey grabbed the phone, checked the network, checked the time settings. The phone time was correct. The app time was correct.

Only the location ping was wrong.

Or it was right, and our definition of “now” was the thing that had drifted.

The radio crackled again, and Caleb’s voice returned, clearer than before, like someone stepping closer to a window.

“Base,” he said, and he sounded calmer, which was worse. “I can see you.”

I froze.

Drew’s voice came instantly. “Caleb, where are you? We don’t see you.”

Caleb whispered, “You’re right there.”

Casey’s eyes darted to me, wide.

Caleb continued, and his voice had the dazed quality of someone describing something they didn’t have words for.

“I’m at the creek,” he said. “I’m on the log. I’m looking at all of you. You’re not… you’re not standing where you are.”

Drew’s voice sharpened. “Caleb, step off the log. Step back.”

A pause, then Caleb’s quiet, bewildered answer.

“I can’t. The log is longer than it should be.”

The trailer felt too small suddenly, as if the walls had moved closer.

Jillian made a sound behind me, a strangled breath.

I took the mic, because I needed my voice in the system, needed an anchor.

“Caleb,” I said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator. Listen to me carefully. Do you see the water? Do you see the dead snag on the right side?”

“Yes,” he said, and his voice shook at the edges. “But it’s… it’s looping. The water keeps meeting itself.”

I closed my eyes for a second, just long enough to feel the weight of my own heartbeat.

When I opened them, Casey was watching me like she was waiting for permission to be afraid.

“Caleb,” I said, “I need you to tell me something only you and Jillian would know.”

Jillian leaned forward, trembling.

Caleb’s voice came softly. “We went to that ramen place, the one with the paper lanterns. She made me try the soft egg even though I said it looked weird.”

Jillian’s hand flew to her mouth. Tears spilled instantly, silent and unstoppable.

It was him.

It was him, and he was talking to us from a place where the creek met itself and time was a circle you could step onto.

My mind tried to salvage a plan.

“Drew,” I said, “Team One, extend a line. Throw a rope to the log, but do not cross. Keep tension light. We’re not pulling. We’re giving him an anchor.”

Drew answered, “Copy.”

I switched to Team Two. “Nina, I need you to establish visual on Luis and Mara. Confirm if you can see their exact position. Give me bearings.”

“Copy,” Nina replied.

Everything moved at once after that, like we’d kicked a hive.

Team One secured a rope to a tree, tossed the coil. Drew narrated, voice tight but professional. The rope landed near the log.

“Caleb,” Drew called, “reach for the rope. Tie it around your waist if you can.”

Caleb’s breathing came through the radio like a tide. “It’s… it’s closer on your side than mine.”

“Reach anyway,” Drew said.

There was a sound then, a faint scraping, as if fabric had dragged across wood.

“I have it,” Caleb whispered, and Jillian sobbed aloud behind me, raw and involuntary.

Drew’s relief came through in a single exhale. “Good. Hold it. Don’t move.”

Caleb’s voice was suddenly very small. “Drew,” he said.

“How do you know my name?” Drew snapped, and then immediately sounded regretful.

Caleb didn’t answer the question. “Drew,” he said again, “you’re standing behind yourself.”

Drew went silent.

Then, in the background of Drew’s transmission, I heard something else, faint but unmistakable.

Another voice.

Drew’s voice, delayed, like an echo that had learned how to speak.

“Team One to Base,” the delayed voice said, “we’re at the creek crossing.”

Casey stared at me, horrified.

The radio was not bouncing. It was repeating, but not as a loop. As a second channel of reality that was slightly out of phase.

Nina called in, and her voice was sharp enough to cut.

“Base, Team Two. We have visual on Luis and Mara.”

“Copy,” I said quickly. “Confirm their position.”

There was a pause that felt like the air holding its breath.

Nina’s voice returned, lower. “Evan… we have visual on Luis and Mara, but…”

“But what?”

“There are two pairs,” she said, and the words came out like she didn’t want her mouth to form them. “Two positions. Same clothing. Same movements. Like a delayed mirror.”

My hands went numb on the map.

In the trailer, Jillian was shaking so hard the chair beneath her rattled.

I keyed up to Luis. “Luis, do you hear Team Two? They have visual on you.”

Luis’s response was immediate. “We can see them too,” he said, and his voice sounded strained, as if he’d been holding something heavy for too long. “But… Evan, there’s another Team Two.”

My stomach lurched.

Mara’s voice came, soft and urgent. “Evan, the forest just… stitched.”

“Explain,” I said, though I didn’t want the explanation.

Mara whispered, “The ridge line moved. It slid like fabric. There’s a seam.”

A seam.

That was the word.

I looked at the map, at the contour lines, at the bowls nested inside bowls. They had always looked like folded fabric, but I had never considered the possibility that they might actually behave like it.

Drew’s voice came again. “Base, rope tension changed.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s heavier,” Drew said, and I could hear the strain in his breathing. “Like someone grabbed the other end, but not Caleb. Like… like the rope is going somewhere else.”

“Caleb,” I said urgently, “are you holding the rope?”

“Yes,” Caleb whispered, but his voice sounded distant now, muffled, as if he’d stepped underwater. “Evan… I can see the trailhead from here.”

“That’s impossible,” I said, and the words felt useless.

Caleb continued, voice trembling. “I can see Jillian’s car. I can see you. You’re all standing by the trailer. You’re… you’re looking at maps. You’re…”

His breathing hitched. “Evan, you’re sitting at the table, and you’re also walking into the trees.”

My heart hammered once, hard.

I wasn’t in the woods. I hadn’t left the trailer.

I had been at the trailer the whole time.

I tightened my grip on the microphone until my fingers ached.

“Caleb,” I said, forcing the words to sound like procedure, “tell me what I’m wearing.”

Caleb’s voice became oddly calm, like someone who has stopped trying to fight the shape of things.

“You’re wearing your red search jacket,” he said. “The one with the tape on the shoulder. You have a coffee stain on the chest, and you don’t notice it until later.”

A cold wave rolled through me.

I looked down at my jacket.

Red. Search patch. Tape on the shoulder from a repair I’d never bothered to redo properly.

And a coffee stain, dark and crescent-shaped, right where my hand had been resting, hidden by the map until this moment.

I had spilled coffee on myself this morning. I hadn’t looked down.

Caleb’s voice went softer. “Evan… the rope is… it’s going into the water, but the water is… it’s like it has depth that doesn’t belong to it.”

Drew swore under his breath, and then his voice snapped back into professionalism like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

“Base, we’re seeing the rope line sink.”

“Sinking?” I repeated.

“It’s going down,” Drew said, and his breathing was harsh. “Not into the creek. Into… into the reflection.”

Into the reflection.

Option three, the misalignment, made real in my mind like a nightmare deciding to obey the laws of physics just long enough to hurt you.

Jillian stood up abruptly, chair scraping. “Caleb!” she shouted, and her voice cracked. “Caleb, I’m here!”

Caleb responded immediately, but his words weren’t to her. They were to me, and they were barely more than a breath.

“Evan,” he said, “I can hear you calling my name from earlier.”

My mouth went dry. “Earlier today?”

Caleb’s voice trembled. “No. Earlier than today. It’s… it’s like the sound has been waiting here.”

A sound waiting.

A call that arrived before it was made.

I thought of the 4:18 timestamp sitting in Jillian’s app like a fixed point, like a nail hammered into time.

I thought of the breadcrumb gaps, the coordinate jumps, the duplicated teams on ridges.

I thought of Mara’s seam.

I forced myself to do the only thing I knew how to do when the world stopped behaving; I tried to simplify.

“Drew,” I said, “do not pull. Keep rope tension steady. Caleb, do not step forward. Do not step back. If you can, sit.”

Caleb whispered, “I already did.”

Then, in the background, under the hiss, under the creek sound that should not have carried through a radio, I heard something that made my blood turn to ice.

My own voice.

Not live, not from the trailer, but thin and distorted like it had been recorded on cheap tape.

“Caleb,” the recorded Evan said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator.”

It was the exact phrase I had used earlier, the same cadence, the same professional calm.

Only the timestamp in Jillian’s app flickered, and for a split second it read **4:18 PM**, then **4:18 PM** again, as if it couldn’t decide which reality it wanted to belong to.

Casey’s eyes were wide, wet with terror she hadn’t let herself feel yet.

“What is happening,” she mouthed.

And outside the trailer, somewhere beyond the parking lot, beyond the first mile of trail, beyond the bowls folding into themselves like hands closing, the radio cracked once more and Caleb whispered the last thing I ever heard him say, a sentence that sounded like a man realizing he had already crossed a line he never saw.

“It’s closing,” he said softly, “but it’s closing around the part of me that already came back, and I can feel the distance pulling like a muscle, and Evan, I think I’m about to arrive where I started, except when I look at the trailhead now, the trailer is already packed up, Jillian is already gone, and you’re walking into the trees with my red beanie in your hand like you-”",3,1769481701.0,horrorstories,0,0.8,False
1qo1f7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1qo1f7d/what_the_bleep_do_you_mean_by_just_be_the_person/,What the BLEEP do you mean by JUST BE the person???,"You hear coaches say in the comments all the time: ""Just be the person who already has it.""

And there is always the same response: ""What does that even mean? I *am* being the person, I'm doing all the things!""

So let me break down what we actually mean by that.

**You are not manifesting the thing. You are manifesting a version of yourself that has the thing.   You are shifting your identity.**

The SP, the money, the body—whatever it is—that's not what you are manifesting. You are shifting your identity. Your state (Your state of being). A version of you where having that “thing” is completely normal and natural.

**And here's the key: everything flows from your state.**

Your state of being holds a set of beliefs and assumptions → those beliefs create your thoughts and feelings → those thoughts and feelings create your behaviours and reactions.

So when I say ""be the person,"" I'm not telling you to fake it or pretend. I'm telling you to occupy the state. Because when you change your state, everything else automatically shifts as a byproduct.  You don't need to flip your thoughts all day. You don't need to fix your feelings. You don’t need to “detach”.  All you have to do is shift your state. 

Think about it this way: right now, you have a coffee mug. Do you wake up affirming ""I have a coffee mug""? Do you monitor your thoughts about the mug? No. Because the version of you that has it doesn't think about it. It's just NORMAL.

**That's the state you are manifesting**

The person who has money doesn't anxiously check their bank account. The person in a loving relationship doesn't spiral over unanswered texts. The person with their dream body doesn't stand in the mirror picking apart every flaw.

Why? Because those reactions don't come from that state. Your reactions are actually the biggest tell of what state you are in.

**When you're truly in the state of having it, you react as someone who has it. Naturally.**

It's not about walking around pretending. It's about recognising that in imagination (aka consciousness) is the only reality that actually matters—that you are already being that person.

That version of you already exists. You are not creating it from scratch. You are choosing it. You are shifting into it.

When you fully occupy that state…   FULLY..   That's when you will naturally stop wavering between ""I have it"" and ""I'm waiting for it"". Because your behaviours will change

Remember—**there is no one to change but self!**
