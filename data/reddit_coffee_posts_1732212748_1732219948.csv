When I brewed these in my Bonavita 1800TS there were great, but I can’t seem to replicate that same flavor from the Aiden.  Admittedly, I’m not an expert on brew temperatures, bloom time, etc. but no matter what I do, I can’t seem to produce a decent cup.  Does anyone have a good brew profile for these coffees?  I’m desperate.

My plans include a small fridge, AC, Starlink, coffee maker, outlets for charging a laptop.  I'd like to avoid campgrounds and there for, no shore power.

1gwostx,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gwostx/am_i_allowed_to_exclude_certain_customers_from_my/,Am I allowed to exclude certain 'customers' from my business? [CA],"Cliff notes: We opened gym with adjoining juice/coffee bar, clientele from card/game/comics shop in same center come in and cause disturbances, behave poorly, have hygiene issues, spend no money, subsequently drive off our gym clientele. How do I legally address this without transforming my deli into 'members-only?'

My wife and I spent every penny we've ever earned, plus inheritances, plus loans, etc. on building out a health and wellness center, which includes a comprehensive gym space, yoga/dance studio, a classroom, a sauna, with an adjoining juice/tea/coffee bar. We just call it the Deli for short, as it was a shuttered deli before we took it over. This business is our life's work, and something we're extremely passionate about. We live in a very high CoL area where there is a greater focus on health and wellness and fitness, which is why we chose this particular location.

Here is the issue: In the commercial center where our business is located, there is a comics/games/card shop. We're having an issue where the game store's clientele are coming over to the deli in groups, taking over our patio and inside tables and playing card games, board games, etc. This isn't that big of a deal as we want to be welcoming and open to the community and hopefully use the deli as a way to promote our programs and memberships, however, these folks just don't spend any money, don't become members (even when offered trial memberships) and they frequently cause disturbances and it is severely affecting our paying membership clientele. We're over it. We just had someone have a full-blown crying episode and lock themselves in the restroom, and we don't know why.

We've been advised we can't prevent them from coming in, even though it's very easy to tell who is coming from the gym and who is coming from the game store. We've received a lot of comments and complaints over the last month over how the deli is filled with these young people and it is simply driving off our membership and desired clientele. Fortunately we haven't had any membership cancellations but we really want our juice/coffee bar to be a place our members can go before/after their workouts to replenish and refresh themselves, and they're being made to feel very uncomfortable. How do we handle this with grace? Can we really not just put up a sign that says ""[game store] customers are not welcome at this establishment.""?",2,1732219413.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

1gwopxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1gwopxx/i_secretly_hate_that_my_family_expects_me_to/,I secretly hate that my family expects me to always pick up the tab.,"I need to get this off my chest because it’s been eating at me for a while. My family has this unspoken expectation that I’ll always pay for things whenever we go out. Whether it’s dinner, a family event, or even something casual like coffee, the bill always seems to end up in front of me, and no one offers to split it or pitch in.  
  
I understand that I’m in a better financial situation than some of them. I worked hard, saved, and even got lucky with some unexpected money recently, which gave me a bit of a cushion. But that doesn’t mean I want to be the default bank account every time we’re together. It’s not even about the money—it’s the lack of acknowledgment or appreciation that stings the most.  
  
Last week, we went out for dinner to celebrate my mom’s birthday. It was a nice restaurant, and I didn’t mind covering the bill—it was a special occasion. But then a few days later, my sibling called and casually asked if I could send them some money because they were “short” for the week. No explanation, no urgency, just the assumption that I’d say yes.  
  
I know I should speak up, but I hate confrontation, especially with family. I’m worried they’ll see me as selfish or ungrateful, and I don’t want to create tension. But at the same time, I feel taken advantage of, and it’s starting to build resentment.  
  
Have any of you been in a similar situation? How do you set boundaries with family without causing a blow-up? I love them, but I don’t think this dynamic is sustainable for me anymore.",6,1732219223.0,confessions,3,1.0,False

I’m 5ish days before my period and in full blown crisis mode. Blew up at my boyfriend this morning, then we got into a fight about it over text. I’m also experiencing some anniversary effect from old trauma and things are just stressful in my life in general right now. Everything feels like it’s falling apart and it feels like nothing is ever going to feel or be better ever again. It feels like the only thing that could possibly ground me is hurting myself and I’m spiraling into really dark thoughts about everyone being better off if I just wasn’t here anymore. Really need any form of encouragement right now. 

For context, I’m on Slynd, Buspirone (which limits the amount of other medications or natural things I can take like certain vitamin supplements), and Hydroxyzine because everything else we’ve tried has either just not worked or we’ve found out I have some weird sensitivity to it (including any sort of birth control that contains estrogen; I also have a rare genetic mutation that means I’m allergic to SSRIs and go into anaphylaxis anytime I take any). I’m trying to wean myself off coffee, but please don’t recommend anymore prescription medications. I know any suggestions will be well intentioned, but there are just lots of things I can’t take without risking a hospital visit. ",1,1732219111.0,PMDD,2,1.0,False

I'm open to locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too 👻

1gwonu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mitralvalveprolapse/comments/1gwonu6/successful_mvp_surgery/,Successful MVP surgery,"Thanks to all in this group to help in understanding what was involved for us.  My spouse had mvp surgery 2 weeks ago at Mass General Brigham w/tricuspid and mitral valve repair.  The operation took 4 hours including prep, all successful.  I'm very grateful.  Surgery on Tuesday and home on Sunday.

Milestones as data points for those facing this:  still sedated for all Tuesday but was responsive to voice, 'squeeze my hand, wiggle your feet'  As you know, it's important to be there if you can, but you'll be there to be there.

Breathing tube removed Wednesday early a.m., first walk in ICU soon after and moved to patient chair from bed.  Voice impaired but could speak w/difficulty.  No issues swallowing.  Focus was to get fluid from lungs (a normal effect of heart surgery.)  No memory at all from after surgery through next day.

Thursday: catheter removed, able to walk to bathroom, decent appetite.  Friday had neck IV line removed and wires (in case external pacemaker needed during surgery), so only a line to wrist area remained.

Continued increase in activity, but still lots and lots of dozing, until release Sunday early afternoon and now we've been home for over a week.

Suggestions that were very helpful to us:

* if you'll be undergoing this surgery work on your squats so you're used to your legs doing all the movement from a sitting position.
* get a reclining chair if at all possible.  We sprung for an electric model that can push one forward so almost no leaning forward is needed to get your weight over your legs.  Getting in and out of bed is still on our to-do list.
* also a shower with hand spray.  These are easy to install, if you're reasonably handy.  Also a seat for the shower.  In some cases, local councils on aging may have resources for borrowing.
* also a bedside table on rollers.  Reaching is a challenge for a while, too.
* bring decent food as soon as the patient can eat.  The best hospital food is the most bland, sadly, and even then. . .  We tried falafel and that was inedible.   Softer foods I brought: PB&J, chicken.  And good coffee.  For us, there were no dietary restrictions -- obviously, ask your care team.
* be aware that the patient will be mentally tired as well as physically so.  Talking about the news (you know what I mean) was out.  wireless headphones for music was especially helpful (J-Lab has a great and inexpensive model.)  Prepared playlists are helpful.  I was able to port some favorite music from cassette tapes.
* the first few days as a caregiver are particularly intense (if you're not used to it.)  Reaching, flushing, opening jars, pushing, pulling will be a bridge too far for a while.  Now (2+ weeks) able to push doors with light force.
* Getting the meds squared away was an early frustration.  The medical team will call in Rx to your pharmacy, but they have no idea if it will be there when you show up.  Best to call before going, if that's possible.  
* Remember that everyone is scrambling throughout the medical community and pharmacies.  It's a hard job and everyone is understaffed.  But don't hesitate to speak up for what you need.  

I know we are fortunate that everything went so smoothly, including the recovery.  But, as someone in this subreddit said, this is a day at the office for the surgery and care team.",1,1732219079.0,mitralvalveprolapse,0,1.0,False

I'm 22, a girl, & I love to do girly things. I like collecting vinyls and playing them on my record player, (I also love to collect kombucha bottles, artsy tote bags, & vintage Hawaiian shirts), go on bike rides around my neighborhood for fun, sipping on an iced vanilla chai latte at coffee shops while doing uni homework, collecting adorable stickers and smacking them on my water bottle or my bike, watching cute little comfort sitcoms like new girl or modern family, learning Chinese on duolingo to maintain my streak, singing along to Maggie Rogers songs while in the shower, developing a hobby for cooking because I find it very therapeutic, cuddling my (half Great Dane/husky) dog while giving her forehead kisses as she falls asleep in my lap, FaceTiming my friends before going to bed, write in my journal, walking around farmers markets on saturday mornings. all normal things that normal girls do. but I'm not treated normally. like...at all. I'm treated like I don't belong anywhere. at my last job, I developed a friendship with a boy, and at first people would lightly tease us saying we act like boyfriend & girlfriend, but over time, the jokes got invasive and misogynistic. rumors spread that we hooked up and he took my virginity and got me pregnant. he was being congratulated, meanwhile I got shamed. there are more stories I could tell about my old job. such as, I once called out this non-black latino guy (I'm also Latina myself) that he said the n slur in the employee group chat. I tried to tell him that his behavior is very unprofessional and problematic. All of my coworkers gaslit the hell out of me. In high school, a student who was my classmate got caught selling another female classmates nudes (we were all 16/17 at the time so it was child porn), and it got swept under the rug. I had a female teacher who had issues and treated me very rudely after I told her I was an unapologetic feminist and I would bring up my feminist viewpoints during debates & discussions. Her attitude towards me was uncalled for, and I learned that she has a record of picking one female student every year and bullying them for nothing. I was that student when I took her class. But this same teacher had no issue with a male classmate being openly homophobic and transphobic (even when we have openly queer & gender nonconforming students in our classroom and on campus), and a different male classmate sharing a pornographic video of him sleeping with another female student. But I mention I'm pro choice during a debate about teen pregnancy, and suddenly I'm the most hated student in class. if I even try to defend myself, I'm playing the victim. so many male family members have done horrendous things to my other female family members. I'm the only openly left winger in a family full of registered republicans. a lot of the women in my family are told to keep quiet about what the men have done to them, and if they speak up, it's their \*fault\* for starting drama. I've spoken up numerous times because I think this rule is absolutely bonkers, and that makes me treated like the burden of the family. even some other women will turn their back on you. Being a woman feels like psychological torture. Meanwhile you watch men get congratulated and praised and called ""misunderstood geniuses"" whenever they do anything they want, no matter how horrible they are to the women and people around them. To the men of this server who are skeptical about what women experience on a daily basis, I hope this opened your eyes a little. to the women, if you found this relatable, I'm so sorry. anyways thank you for listening to my rant.",1,1732218913.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1gwokzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITARelationship/comments/1gwokzy/aita_for_not_wanting_to_cooperate_with_this_cat/,AITA for not wanting to cooperate with this cat thing anymore?,"Hello everyone.

After almost a year of self-reflection and meltdown, I (25 F) decided to create this post because I need help.

I met my boyfriend (26 M) in the summer of last year and since then I knew that he and his ex-girlfriend shared a cat. It was never a problem for me, except when months later I discovered that she still had a key to his house, where I was currently living. How did I find out? Because without consulting me, my boyfriend gave her permission to enter ""my"" house that I was also paying at the time and spend time with his animal. From then on, I began to feel uncomfortable, especially when she always went to him to solve the most banal issues (e.g. computer programs, sending memes, asking about sites where they used to watch content and even sending emails with past photos and the title ""best moments""). However, a few months ago, she found herself without a house that allowed pets and wanted to go to our current house to see her pet. I said that this was unthinkable, because I feel super uncomfortable given the whole situation. Not to mention mocked and disrespected. My boyfriend and I agreed that she would be with the animal when her house allowed it. Last month, a miracle happened: she could have the cat with her and so it was. The thing is, the next hour she was already messaging my boyfriend with all sorts of questions, including a comment about the food: ""Ahh, it's still the same..."". As you can imagine, a person who constantly tries to remind someone else of the past is someone who is not well resolved about the situation and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I don't have to be the kind of person who accepts these things and I have to feel good about my relationship, which I haven't felt for some time because of this issue. My boyfriend then told her to say goodbye to the cat because it's unsustainable to carry on like this forever. She didn't take it well, thought she was in the right and sent me messages to arrange a coffee. I refused and told her that if she wanted to say something, she was welcome to. Quoted by her: ""Honestly, you're totally in denial and I don't want anyone to suffer any consequences.... I want everyone to be able to feel good 🌿"". Still, I agreed to have a call with her, I really tried to accept her opinion and expose my own and the conversation ended with her saying that she can send whatever she wants to my boyfriend and that the cat is another subject and I have to accept it. In the end, she says I'm not mature enough. Nowadays, she says she'll return the animal next year and then she'll tell him the date, but I don't think it's up to her since the cat has a chip registered in my boyfriend's name. We don't know where she lives and my boyfriend wants to wait. My boyfriend has always defended her side, as her being an orfan person who just wants to see her animal, but all the additional content makes me see that it's not just that. I feel bad, I feel mocked and and I feel that my will is not respected. I feel like I want this to end and that I've tried to be as understanding as possible, but everyone has screwed me over in this situation. I feel my ego and my personal structure being hurt by having to accept that a person I don't know from anywhere has this power in my relationship.

1gwoju8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnarkyRecapsBySwiss/comments/1gwoju8/jingle_janglesjeografy_with_jeremaw_the_bride/,Jingle Jangles/Jeografy with Jere-Maw- The Bride Wore Hip Waders/ Jason’s Tennessee Wedding,"Hello, hello my snarky little gnocchis. Today we are going to see what Jingle says about the wedding of the 75^(th) Lost Boy, J’Orchestra Pit and his new helpmeet, OfJ’Orchestra Pit aka The Fledding or Flood Wedding. They chose to get married after an act of God had literally rained disaster all around them. Asheville is 65-ish miles away. They wouldn’t be our J’Locust Herd without that certain brand of tone deafness we’ve all gathered to snark upon several times, though. With that, let’s dive on in.

Jingle and Jere-Maw get into a car in the dark and sleepily croak their way through their intro, with Jingle’s curls in full styled form. Her voice croaks along and tells us it’s the wedding for J’Orchestra Pit. Jere-Maw complains about how it’s too early. I mean, that’s when I get in the car to drive down almost to Tennessee, but I hate nothing more than Cincinnati rush hour traffic and I realize most people are horrified at the thought of being woken up at 3 am. Anyways, Jere-Maw starts the car, unceremoniously dumping the video into darkness as Jingle prattles on. She turns the previously illegal while driving map light on to bring the visuals back on line. She informs us that it’s “3-something” in the morning and they are on their way to the airport. The empty carseat straps tell us that Publicitee and Privacee aren’t going to be along for the trip. I wonder if Jere-Maw’s parents flew in or they’re trying to make their own version of Home Alone with an automatic dog feeder to dispense their melatonin and recording it on the home cameras. Jingle mutters “it’s crazy” and the intro jumps in with the usual idiotic “Oh yeah, oh yeah” song and thankfully it’s just their glitchy initial monogram for a few seconds and not the whole reel.

Jingle finally puts on her seatbelt and says it’s a long travel day and they will arrive in “Nox-VILLE” at 4:45 PM, so it looks like J’Planes was too busy to fly around the country and pick up all of the far flung members of the J’Locusts. Jere-Maw has to throw in that they gained 3 hours and we get it, Soccer Boy can count. It still means you’re up at 3 am your time. The two brains of the Books family argue back and forth over whether it’s 2 or 3 hours, using Nashville not being on the East Coast as a reference. Nashville is in the middle of the state, for starters while Knoxville is closer to North Carolina. Secondly, Tennessee is a land-locked state which means the East Coast doesn’t matter but time zones don’t care about that and the eastern third of the state is in fact in the Eastern Time Zone. Speaking of the East Coast, Jere-Maw’s parents are watching the Books children. Jere-Maw immediately starts yelling “it’s a date, we’re on a date”. He probably thinks the baby is a boy, so he’s kissing her ass.  Jingle says “let’s go” and lines her transition up so that it shows her and Jere-Maw on the plane, having breakfast. Jingle does a weird lick lip before trying to get Jere-Maw’s attention off of his burrito and onto their presumed adoring audience. He flicks a smirk at the camera as Jingle says Jere-Maw is trying to pick a movie. He’s actually putting sauce on his breakfast but Jingle tells us he thinks they should watch Dune 1 and 2 but she isn’t sure that it’s available. Jere-Maw gets back to his entertainment research as Jingle gets back to her job as Itinerary Narrator. This 4 hour flight takes them to Chicago for a lay-over then an hour and 45 minute flight to Nashville. Hopefully she misspoke or that’s gonna be a longer drive to the Fledding than she thought.

Next, we have Jingle’s usual plane wing shot, two pans to Jere-maw, once while watching a screen, the second of him smirking as they land in Tennessee. Jingle misspoke and they did in fact arrive at Knoxville. They are picking up the rental and heading to the rehearsal dinner to see her side of the family and how super excited she is. Oh, she finally mentions Hurricane Helene and the flooding. “It’s crazy” that their hotel doesn’t have power or water, and I think it’s crazy that they’re still holding a wedding. God can’t give them the willpower to keep it in their pants a couple more months? Sounds sus to me. Okay…she says “it’s just kind of a crazy time to be in Knoxville and this whole area but we’re glad we made it, we’re going to go party!” I wonder if she will think it's “crazy but oh well, party time ” when her backyard is floating down the road on an atmospheric river? If she had said “there but for the grace of God, go I” I would have given her credit for more than half-assed performative pity.  More scenery as Jere-Maw bounces another full size white SUV around. Someone stops to wave Jere-Maw through and this single act of kindness floors him with “how nice everyone is”. This is the perfect tie into the plug for the little coffee shop they just went to. She fumbles for words to describe it as she zones out and looks out the window as the SUV accelerates and bounces through Knoxville. As they go past Knoxville Jingle tells Jere-Maw that they lived here for a month and a half, maybe 2 months because it “seemed longer” when RimJob decided to give Mother Cabbage Patch (KJ Bates)  a Mother’s Day present that was actually turning her house into a 3 floor remodel instead of a new laundry room. Jere-Maw asks how old she was when that happened, and Jingle can’t remember. It’s not like her childhood was recorded on a national cable network or anything. She tries to nail it down by saying “I was young but driving” before she changes the subject back to the plot of 19 KAC Season 3 episodes 5,6, and 7. Jingle reminisces about all the driving, the thrift stores and the mountains of Bojangles chicken and Sonic. I guess RimJob had coupons. It turns out the Bateses would ride their horses into town to get Cracker Barrel and Sonic. Y’all. I bet Gilly Muffin got a library book about shoeing horses and they shod those ponies themselves. Jingle ends the story with “it’s funny”. Well, or backwards, take your pick. Jere-Maw blandly remarks about how beautiful the mountains are as Jingle agrees. On to the vaguely plantation-y venue, which Jingle deems “stunning”. Most, if not all, outdoor venues have stunning views though, so take it with a grain of salt.

The music takes over and Jingle pans across the rehearsal showing the J’Locusts and J’Lost Boys, with J’Orchestra Pit in the groom’s spot. OfJ’Orchestra Pit stands at the ready with her father. Jingle takes us behind the scenes as Kath! and Ra! (plus Sage! and Beige!) are seen along with CinderJana holding Planes 2. Other various children mill about behind Jingle as she finally zooms in on Jere-Maw grinning as he sits by a dragon’s hoard of Styrofoam cups. A quick cut to them back in their rental, and they exit the car. We find they are in a Buc-ee’s meeting Clairitin. They go looking for pickles and snacks and things. J’2 Thumbs grabs a basket as Jingle shows off a nearly deserted Buc-ee’s. We quickly cut to Mrs. J’2 Thumbs complaining that an oversized pink hoodie’s pocket is too far down for her comfort. The menfolk chuckle as Jere-Maw returns to collect Jingle. Their jerky picked out, Jere-Maw picks grey Buc-ee’s tshirts for Publicitee and Privacee. “Should we get these?” Jere-Maw asks, for some reason triggering Jingle to put her airs on as she says “let’s do”.

We are finally at the wedding day, where Jingle and Jere-Maw meet up with CInderJana and her Prince Ch-Armed and Dangerous at a small little diner. Jere-Maw ordered a “trash omelet” and I paused it before they explain what it is because it’s not going to be what the actual dish is. A “trash plate” or a “garbage plate” is a plate with basically everything in the diner. All the omelet mix-ins, some meat, eggs, usually biscuits and gravy (not the cookies and brown gravy kind), hashbrowns and cheese all on the same plate and usually mixed up. Don’t knock it until you try it, however  I’m betting this is a Denver and a Western omelet mixed. This Ted Talk brought to you by my life in the Great Lakes area and time as a server in a southern diner chain. Back to our ~~regularly scheduled~~ recapping. Jingle ummms and hmmmms her way though the server bringing ketchup and syrup to the table before turning the camera on herself and making a disgusted face as she says “trash omelet”. She couldn’t get over the name but when she zooms in on the ham and peppers hanging out of the omelet, she thinks it looks good. Prince Ch-Armed and Dangerous digs in and Jingle says that he won’t need to eat until the reception. Jingle doesn’t show her and Jere-Maw’s food, she just shows them walking out with to go coffees. She’s ready to socialize and marry one of her plethora of brothers off. First, outfit change, then an hour drive to the venue.  Jere-Maw makes the correct observation that only in Tennessee will you see someone in an orange suit. He’s not wrong, especially during football season. Jingle can’t find it and asks “like a hunter”, Jere-Maw points out the man in a blaze orange formal suit. Jingle finally remembers she was raised in Arkansas and says “oh, like the Vols”. Girl, how many Razorback games did you attend and your brain didn’t immediately go there?  Jere-Maw comments he’s seen so much orange the past two days and yeah…that’s the south in fall. You live and die by your team’s season on Saturday. As they pull up towards the man in the orange suit, Jingle realizes it’s security to keep the crazy people out. The same type of crazy as the catastrophic floods you’re on the edge of?

We are now treated to J’Orchestra Pit hitting the generic stop and pose with Jere-Maw as he yells “he’s getting married”. Congrats and snaps to Jere-Maw for identifying the right one of his J-in-Loves. The El Ay Bookses take their seats and treat the viewers to the backs of everyone’s heads. OfJ’Orchestra Pit must have just seated the siblings in order or it’s a coinkinydink that Jingle’s seated behind the Count and Countess Gagula. The $eaWorlds are next to the Gagulas, proving my theory. The Planes are next to the El Ay Bookses, disproving it. “Here comes the drone” states Jingle as she cuts the scene. Music takes over as people are escorted in. RimJob escorts in Meech as the Tontitown Gruesome Twosome have their smiles creepily pinned to their face, as always, and they make their way to the front. The J’Locusts in the wedding party are J’Lost In The Airport, J’2Thumbs and J’Annoying Orange with Jed! as the best man.  As the music starts, Jingle’s zoom lens catches Nostrils holding A.G. as the music starts and J’Orchestra Pit tears up. Gilly Muffin Bates is seen in the crowd also as the imminent Mrs. J’Orchestra Pit  walks by and the wedding vows begin. Quickly we come to the end and they kiss to riotous applause. The newly hitched J’Orchestra Pits go to start back down the aisle, the officiant gently jerks a knot in their tails with a “whoa” and a “hold on” and he says his final line introducing us to the newly minted couple. The raucous cheering leads to a sharp cut.

We land in the reception tent where CinderJana is getting spun across the floor by Prince Ch-Armed and Dangerous. When Jingle asks why they stopped, they say they heard something about food. Jingle seagull chuckles as she goads them into another spin on the floor. Anything for content I guess. They sit by the CinderJanas, who are exuberantly discussing other people and Jingle zooms in on the kids table as one of the children shoulder dances in their chair.  CinderJana suddenly remembers it’s JimBlessa’s birthday and….no it isn’t. October 3^(rd) is like a month before JimBlessa’s birthday. I can’t wait to see what happens. Everyone starts nodding at Jingle, especially J’Planes who has just enough eye contact to make it creepy. Jingle then shoves the camera in CarlinAndJoy’s faces. Is this a dry wedding or is this broad toasted? The dance music cuts out and gentle music come in as the first dance is illuminated by gigantic sparklers.

Jere-Maw steps behind the camera and yells “we’re lit, round 2 round 2” which could answer my wedding booze question or he’s talking about more sparklers. It’s the couple’s grand exit, including a dip kiss in the middle of the walk to the car. Jingle suddenly yells “almost in my hair, love, almost in my hair” as Jere-Maw chuckles. Bro. You almost singed your wife’s hair off. I hear it too but dude, mind your sparkler. “Disaster avoided” states Jere-Maw as he tries to zoom in on the Porsche convertible that is serving as the J’Orchestra Pits’ getaway car. The brake lights light up the shot as Jere-Maw positions himself right behind the car. I hope it’s not a stick because he’s liable to get run over if J’Orchestra Pit takes too long to shift it into gear. Which is exactly what people keep yelling for him to do. Finally, he revs the tires and the Texas plate reading “Dusez” comes into view as the car pulls away. The brake lights dominate the screen as Jere-Maw laughs and comments about the parking brake as J’Orchestra Pit lays on the horn and pulls out onto the road. Jere-Maw puts the camera in J’Annoying Orange’s face and asks for a wrap. J’Annoying Orange whistles loudly before realizing he’s being asked to do something specific. He says “that’s all folks, see ya later” and Jere-Maw says “not for this guy”. J’Annoying Orange suddenly gets serious and says “hey, you’ll see ***me***”. Like ok, J’Scary. Next, they’re on the road, taking the exit to Rocky Top aka the Bates’ Nest, previously known as Lake City before naming themselves after the state song in an act of pure pretention. But despite all that CinderJana has taken the driver’s seat as they go shopping at E L E V E N T W E N T YS EEEV E N at Bates Sisters Boutique. Ohhh can’t wait to see what beige, ecru, eggshell and cream wonders they have for sale there. CinderJana is driving, OfPlanes is in the backseat while Carlin and JimBlessa will meet them there.  Jingle does say she’s never been to Rocky Top before because it was Lake City when they took over the Bates’ Nest for 2 months.

“It’s time for cash and carry” Jingle sings before explaining that she didn’t bring any cash. As Jingle walks around with an arm of beige and muted dusky colors she laments she didn’t bring a big enough bag to pack it all back. She then shows the Bateses running the shop giving styling lessons to the Duggalettes. As Jingle heaps platitudes on the owners for giving her such bounty, Carlin announces that Jingle is the nicest person ever. OfNostrils of course came along with and Jingle approves of her and OfPlanes’ hauls.

The next day, they’re back in the car, eating McDonalds. Jingle stayed up until 2, Jere-Maw was up until 4. Jingle comments how nice it was to see everyone, how it was so much fun and now they are going back to see the girls. The outro is just the plane wings flying.

There we have it folks, getting the rust knocked off and hopefully back into the swing of things. Have a great rest of the day and stay warm if you’re in the snowy parts.",1,1732218805.0,SnarkyRecapsBySwiss,0,1.0,False
1gwojj8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gwojj8,At last! My very first typewriter! 1930s Royal P,"My 1930s Royal P typewriter is finally back in my possession after a nearly 2 month long stay at the local repairman’s shop. This is my very first typewriter, a glossy black piece of heirloom history I picked up from an elderly seller who had this sitting in her closet, tucked away and forgotten, an antique quietly ignored. It’s now outfitted with all new rubber, a new ink ribbon, and all its bits and bobs are in perfect working order. 

And it’s mine. All mine.

“This is a beautiful machine,” the repairman said. “I really enjoyed working on this. Customers bring all kinds of crap in here, and I have to turn people away. Most of those older typewriters are junk. But this one… It doesn’t get much better than this.”

It’s addicting. The feel of the keys. The slowness. The analog clack of the hammer as it drives each letter into the ribbon, pressing ink to the page. The feel is just as electric as a juicy fountain pen, and I am enamored. It forces you to think as you type. On an electric keyboard, I’m 150wpm. But on this… it’s like a sip of tea compared to the frenetic buzz of coffee. Mellow and thoughtful. Elegant.

1gwojcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gwojcd/i_realized_it_was_a_situationship_so_i_ended_it/,"I realized it was a situationship, so I ended it - now I need to get over him","I (24 F) met this guy (30 M) in the gym in August and things have been going well between us for the past three months. We have been going on dates, and I've been spending time with him at his house (cooking dinner together, watching shows and movies on Netflix). We also have sex regularly and see each other about once a week. We spent about every weekend together for the past three weeks. We text every single day and FaceTime a few times a week. There's amazing emotional chemistry between us and I enjoy our conversations and time together a lot. He has expressed the same sentiment. We both have been able to be vulnerable with one another about stuff with our families, mental health, and careers. He frequently compliments by intellect, personality, and physical appearance. In the beginning, we both agreed we weren't looking for anything serious. However, after about two months, I felt like he was applying more pressure. For example:

* He took me out to a nice restaurant for my birthday and brought me flowers 
* When I went to NYC with my friends, he offered to order me Ubers so I didn't have to take the subway
* He's talked to me about getting me some sort of protection for self-defense (e.g., a taser or pocketknife) for when I'm out alone
* He's put air in my tire for me without me asking
* He offered to pay for my car wash 
*  When I went to NYC with my friends, he offered to order me Ubers so I didn't have to take the subway
* He's expressed multiple times how he wants to spend more time with me
* He has cooked me dinner 
* When I had a migraine, he offered to bring me medicine 
* He's always asking me to spend the night, although I never have 
* Once, he asked if I wanted to run errands with him 
* He's giving me massages 
* He's randomly sent me money to get a coffee
* He asked me once about my thoughts on finding ""the one""
* If it has been a while since I texted him back, he would double text me to check on me 

There's so many more examples, but these were the main ones that could come to mind as I'm writing this. To me, these actions were surprising. I'm new to dating, but just felt like these weren't the actions of someone who you are casually dating. It felt more intentional. There were a few weeks in October where I was super busy and could only stop by after work for about an hour/hour and a half. During that time, we'd have sex and I'd leave shortly after. After a few weeks of this, we had a conversation where he expressed that he wanted us to focus less on sex and focus more on building an emotional bond and exploring emotional intimacy. He made it clear that he didn't want a situationship and also didn't want just want sex. We agreed that it was okay to have sex, but he didn't want me stopping by just for that and then leaving.

A week later, we had a check in, and he said he wanted to make sure we were on the same page. He made he clear that I was the only girl he was seeing and having sex with. He said he wanted feelings involved and commitment, but only to a certain extent. At the time, I thought I understood what he was asking, but later I realized I wasn't okay with this. It sounded like a situationship, which is what we both agreed we did not want. I did some reflecting and checked in with myself. I realized that my feelings for him have been growing and that if we kept spending time together at such a high frequency and quality, they would continue to grow. I found myself missing him more when we weren't talking and thinking about him more often. I was also craving more time with him and thinking about the next opportunity for us to spend time together. 

I started to get confused because, although he said he didn't want a relationship, the things he was doing and saying made me feel as if I was being courted. I'm not ready for a relationship right now, but I thought that with him saying he was ""intentional"" about how he spends time with me and him expressing his desire to build a bond and intimacy with me, that perhaps we would be able to work toward being in a relationship when we were both ready. I started to worry that we weren't on the same page and, to avoid getting in too deep and getting my feelings hurt, I decided to cut him off.

On Monday, I explained that I didn't feel we were on the same page and that maybe we should part ways to avoid me getting hurt. He seemed shocked and was asking what could be done differently. He reiterated that he was not looking for anything long term and that he needed to do more work on himself before he committed to someone. I completely understand and I'm in the same boat myself, but I just feel that it's a waste of emotional energy to intentionally build intimacy and a bond with someone just for it to go nowhere. To me, that is a situationship, and that's not what I want. I would hope that doing this with someone would eventually lead to something.

The conversation was very mature and there was no yelling or hostility. He seemed disappointed, but we both agreed to part ways. He asked if the lines of communication would still be open between us if he ever changed his mind in the future. He texted me shortly after apologizing, but I did not respond. Tuesday, I started to have some regrets. I was missing him and was worried maybe I'd self-sabotaged and acted impulsively because I was afraid of getting hurt. I asked him if there was a chance we could recalibrate and we discussed some more. He said I needed to have clarity on what I wanted things to look like between us and that deep down, I knew I wouldn't be fulfilled by what he is able to give me in the moment. He kept saying he did not want me to get hurt and that he tried to be clear with me from the beginning about his intentions so I could manage my feelings and expectations. Looking back, I think I texted him Tuesday and was second guessing my decision because I missed him and missed talking to him, but now I realize I made the right decision the first time. I know I will get over him within the next few weeks, but a part of me is mourning what could have been. 

After our second talk on Tuesday, he sent me an Instagram Reelz about an hour later. I did not respond. He also texted me my name later that night and did not say anything after that. I didn't respond to that either. What did he want? It's been hard to ignore him, but I think he was testing the waters to see if he was blocked or if I would respond. I'm not mad at him, but just need my space to get over him. I just want to know where things went wrong. I feel so stupid because things were going so well. I want to be confident that I made the right decision. I'm new to dating and need to know what not to do next time so I don't keep ending up in situations like this. I also need to fight the urge to text him back and stop hoping that he will miraculously change his mind. Any thoughts or tips?",1,1732218774.0,dating,1,1.0,False

First a little bit about myself.I am a student of ics 2nd year (stats and economy).I am 19 years old.I have been practicing computer science subjects since i was in 8th grade.


Got pretty good at web development and builded myself a book shelf software.Whose sole purpose was to keep me accountable of my reading hobby. Got a little bit frustrated in coding and stuff due to academic pressure and left coding like a year ago. 

In college, at my brothers workspace,I discovered Seo. Got pretty good at it that I ranked my first site on the first serp page of google.It payed me when I sold it and landed by myself a decent job round about 15k per month.

Now, although I know i am a little bit ahead of kids of my age. But, the problem is , I am not satisfied by my performance. 

I think I can do much better than this, but my academics is not allowing me too. Half of my tome is spent in college and due to which my energy gets drowned as you the academic situation in Pakistan.

Main boards exams will come in next year and I want to leverage this time I have for my career.

Also, in college i felt into the bad habit of smoking for atleast a year now, and now I can see its impact on my body.

I really want to do something about all which is mentioned above,but don't know how to. Please guide your little brother.  

I want to get a gap year after my second year so , I can focus on my career for atleast a year . Discussed it with my big brother,but he said no! He said go to university (which had a big girls scandal some years ago) professors indulging in adult acitivites with students.

My main interests from now on are: Gym, my work mainly seo and little bit coding , coffee,book reading , statistics.

Also can someone refer me some good books  on statistics? 

Jazak Allah. May Allah reward you guys and bless you with something big.

1gwoiq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1gwoiq8/the_most_comfort_i_ever_felt/,The most comfort I ever felt.,"For nearly 10 years now I've had a recurring dream and again it happened last night. I'll have it 3-4 times a year and after every time it comes to me, I feel more rested and at peace when I wake up than any other time in my life. In general my dreams are always vivid, but trend towards chaotic or confusing. Not this one.

I am walking down a rocky beach, I'm assuming somewhere in the PNW of the US. Then sun is setting into dusk and I can see a bonfire a short way in the distance and an old houseboat anchored into the beach.  I keep walking towards it, and I always find my childhood dog and my current dog playing around the fire. I can feel the air which is heavy and cool, and there's a haze against the dusk from the fire. 

The boat is lit softly and I go inside. It's dated. Wood paneling, a couple floor lamps, and there is tan and green furniture that looks like it's from the early 90's. Once I'm inside the first thing I always do is walk to an old cabinet on the far side that has a record player and set one of my favorite albums to play. I then walk over to the small kitchenette and poor myself coffee. I will turn around and walk over to the small couch where there is a woman asleep. She is facing away from me, and she has long blonde hair covering her face, a tattoo on her arm of a deer, and a bright red leather bracelet around her right wrist that's resting across her chest. I go to sit down beside her, and I always immediately wake up.

I don't know what to make of this. I have never owned a boat, I have never been to the PNW, I don't drink coffee, and I have never known a woman in my personal life matching that description. The only things that feel true to me are my dogs and the music. It feels I fall into another reality a few times a year and before I get any answers I am snatched back. I am not sure there are any answers for any of this, but I really wanted to share it with others.",1,1732218730.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

Sometimes I'll have a pre-workout drink, but there are no calories in that to break my fast. After my workout, I have a Whey protein drink with about 60 grams of protein and other add-ins (chia seeds, flax seed,...). after a couple of hours, usually around 3pm, i start getting hungry, so I'll have an apple or pear. I then eat a regular dinner pushing for high protein. I'll end my fast around 7:15 be eating 2 Oikos greek yogurts with a cup of blueberries and some honey. I drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day, and most of the time i'll just drink water with lemon.

I've lost 75 pounds doing this since the 1st of January 2024. I'd like to lose another 15-20 lbs, but seem to be unable to break the 250 lb mark.

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL ..

What I'm looking for ?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:

\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality

\- Got 4 tattoos.

\- I'm Turkish and living in the UK .

Other stuff :

188cm (6 2 )tall , 90 kg (200 pounds) , fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\* , green eyes, caucasian, brown hair, beard and moustache

Ultimately, I'm looking for something long-term in the hopes that it can turn into something profound, deep, love-fueled… but yeah let's start by being friends, and then let's see where we can lead it !",1,1732218385.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.  
  
I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D  
  
I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL ..  
  
What I'm looking for ?  
  
I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.  
  
I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.  
  
Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:  
  
\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality  
  
\- Got 4 tattoos.

\- I'm Turkish and living in the UK .

  
Other stuff :  
  
188cm (6 2 )tall , 90 kg (200 pounds) , fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\* , green eyes, caucasian, brown hair, beard and moustache  
  
Ultimately, I'm looking for something long-term in the hopes that it can turn into something profound, deep, love-fueled… but yeah let's start by being friends, and then let's see where we can lead it !

Just finished 37 sessions (spread out over 8ish weeks). I had left-side treatment for MDD. About halfway through, they added a three minute ""priming"" component to the beginning of each session.

So here's my experience:

I'm a 39 y/o male, and I've dealt with depression/anxiety since I was about 17 (maybe earlier, but it was diagnosed in high school). I've lost count of the meds I've been on, the therapies I've tried, the workbooks I've used, and the lifestyle changes I've made. Some of them worked ok, some of them not so much, and a few made things much worse. Finally I asked my psych if there was another avenue we could try. He suggested TMS.

My first few sessions I was just excited to be there. Felt good! About a week in, things got a little less fun. Was feeling pretty down and anxious. This ""dip"" continued to get worse for about 3 weeks. No one told me TMS would be so taxing! I was sad, anxious, tired, dizzy, had headaches, low energy...basically all the stuff I was trying to *cure*!

But then, around week 5, things turned a corner. I remember one morning after treatment this sense of the fog just kind of lifting slowly. I had a good day! Then another. Then another. Was it perfect? Nope! In fact, I had another dip around week 7, which coincided with needing to miss a few treatments due to a work trip. But by the time I got back in there, I was on the upswing again. The general trend was moving in the right direction.

Now that I'm done, I feel...honestly, pretty dang good! The biggest difference for me is that I don't feel like I'm fighting my mind every day. Positive/uplifting things feel easier to believe without the oppressive, ""Yeah but..."" that used to hang around all the time. I have more energy, more focus, and more presence. I'm not afraid to do normal things like grab coffee with someone, or go to church, or take my kids on a bike ride. I'm still a bit anxious, but this is just kind of normal for me. The difference is remarkable.

So the big question for me is: will it stick? I don't know. I hope so! At the very least, it's working right now! And for that I'm extremely grateful. But if it doesn't stick long term, I now have another tool in my belt that I know is effective. I'm glad to be here, which is something I could not have said enthusiastically several weeks ago.  I'll try to update again in a month or two for a longer-term update.

Day Three

I know people might be getting impatient to know what happened. I thought about skipping to the present, but there’s so much that happened in the next couple of days, I’d be doing you a disservice not to explain it all. This story needs to get out there. It needs to be told. So this doesn’t happen to you or the people you love.

So your life isn’t destroyed like mine was.

I woke up the next morning with a renewed sense of purpose. I was going to figure out who or what this kid was and why he had inserted himself into our lives. It was Sunday, and Dylan would be home all day, so I could leave the boy and tell them I was going to look for Gus without arousing suspicion.

Our town was small, but quirky. The business district had a maze of different shops lining the streets where you could find artisan soap right next to an ammo shop, right next to a bakery. After breakfast, I hopped in the car and sped toward a specific store, one where I thought maybe I could find some help. It was pretty unassuming from the outside—a tall Victorian-style door set into a brick façade. Above the door, there was a sign: Deadwick’s Emporium

I’d only been in there once before. It wasn’t really my thing—full of tarot card decks, crystals, herbs for potion-making, and other ethereal items. It was dark inside as I swung open the door. The walls and ceiling were painted black, with sparkling strings of golden lights nestled between tree branches that stretched above me. The smell of patchouli washed over me. Candles burned on the service counter, and a woman with a gentle smile greeted me.

“Can I help you find something?” she asked.

I swallowed, hoping what I was about to say didn’t warrant a call to the police. “Do you believe in demons?”

The woman glanced at her coworker at the back of the store, then back at me. “I believe there are things out there that mean to do us harm.” She paused. “Are you okay?”

Tears sprung to my eyes. I shook my head. “No. I need help. This was the only place I could think of to come.”

The woman stepped from behind the counter and motioned for me to follow her. She murmured something to her coworker, who moved to the front of the store, then led me through a door at the back of the store. The small room we stepped into was surprisingly bright compared to the rest of the place. There was a pair of red velvet armchairs, a coffee station, and a table.

“My name is Autumn,” the woman said, motioning to one of the chairs.

“I’m Alyssa,” I said, sinking onto it.

“Can I get you some coffee or tea?”

I nodded miserably. “Yes, please. Tea would be nice.”

Autumn set about heating water and pouring it into two mugs. She plopped a tea bag into each of them, set one in front of me, then settled in the chair across from me.

“Okay, Alyssa, what’s going on?”

Grasping the warm mug in my hands, I let it all spill out. The boy that appeared out of nowhere, claiming to be our lost son. His soulless dark eyes and wide smile, the way he spoke and committed acts of violence without remorse. I told her how everyone in my life remembered him, but me. I even told her about the pictures, at the risk of completely outing myself as mentally unstable.

Autumn listened intently, her eyebrows rising and then furrowing down over her dark eyes as I talked. She took a deep breath when I finished and sat back in her chair. “That’s quite a story.”

“I know I must sound crazy,” I sputtered. “But I don’t think the boy is HUMAN. He’s…he’s some kind of demon or something. I know you have books here, is there anything in them that might help me?”

Autumn’s eyes met mine. “Yes, I’m sure of it. But I don’t need a book to tell me what you’re dealing with.”

I sucked in a breath. She believed me. She wasn’t looking at me like I was nuts. In fact, she looked scared for me. “What is it?”

“I’ll be right back,” she said, setting her mug down. She walked out into the main store and returned a moment later with a heavy book, bound in black leather. She set it down on the table in front of me and flipped through the pages, stopping on a page that was titled, ‘Black-Eyed Children.’

A shudder ripped through me. “Black-eyed children?”

“Everything…well almost everything…fits. The boy asking your permission to come in, his dark eyes, his lack of human feelings.”

Fuck. “Wh-what are they?”

“Demons, of a sort,” Autumn said. “They’re from modern folklore, like an urban legend, but there’s always some truth to urban legends. These demons appear on a person’s doorstep and ask to come in. Once they gain access, both to your home and your mind, they wreak havoc.”

I sucked in a breath. “Your mind??”

Autumn nodded. “They do have the ability to exert influence over a person’s mind. Generally, the weak or vulnerable fall prey to their influence.”

“How do I get rid of it?”

“It’s very hard to get rid of black-eyed children once you invite them in,” Autumn said grimly. “They insert themselves fully into your life—even if deep down you know they don’t belong there—the stronger urge to let them stay pushes that feeling down, burying it.”

“Why isn’t it affecting me?” I asked.

“That’s the curious thing,” Autum said, frowning. “I think…I think he doesn’t NEED you, necessarily.”

“Because of Dylan,” I said.

“He needed permission from both of you to enter the home, but once he got in, he only needs one of you to allow him to stay,” Autumn said.

“Oh my God.”

“I DO think he’s affecting you to some degree though,” Autumn said. “I’d wager a guess that those pictures you saw on your bookshelf weren’t actually there. The bedroom—still just a guest room. And the phone call with your mother? Imagined. Like an illusion. You’re stronger than Dylan, but it’s only going to be a matter of time before you start questioning yourself and forget why you were concerned about the boy in the first place. The only hope you have is to get Dylan to realize what’s going on too, and for both of you to revoke your invitation.”

I nodded. “Okay. Okay.”

“It’s not going to be easy with him fully under the child’s influence,” Autumn warned. “And it will surely be dangerous for you. You might be better off leaving…”

My eyes widened. “Leave Dylan behind! How could I do that?”

“If you value your life, I’d consider it,” Autumn said. “But if you’re not willing to do that, I have some things that might help.”

She stood and I followed her into the main store. In the back corner, there were glass jars filled with herbs and other items I didn’t recognize. “What’s all this?”

“Herbs for potion-making,” Autumn said. “I’m going to make a potion of protection. That’s for you. And a potion for clarity. That’s for your husband.”

She grabbed a Ziploc bag and began dumping carefully measured spoonfuls of herbs into it, then labeled it “P” for protection. Autumn filled a second baggie and labeled it “C” for clarity. She handed them to me.

I dropped them in my purse. “Thanks.”

“You’re to make a tea out of those. A tablespoon steeped in a mug of hot water should do it,” Autumn said. “For your husband, you might want to do two.”

Next, she moved to a table and rummaged around a box of crystals. She emerged with a rough black stone, shiny in places, dull in others.

“What’s that?”

“One of the most powerful crystals for protection,” Autumn answered. “Keep it on you at all times.”

I slipped the crystal into my pocket. “Thanks.”

“Good luck, Alyssa,” she said, walking me to the door. “And, Alyssa? If all else fails…get yourself out.”

My mind drifted to the bags of herbs in my purse as I drove home. When I got there, Dylan was in a mood. He didn’t even glance at me when I walked in.

“Where’s the boy?” I asked.

“What the fuck, Alyssa? ‘The boy?’ He has a name, you know,” he said. “He’s our SON. And he’s in his room. He’s all tired out from the game of soccer we played in the backyard.”

“Soccer?” I asked. “We don’t even own a soccer ball.”

“We do so!” Dylan snapped. “We kicked it around, just this morning. It’s sitting right there next to the front door. You’re really something else!”

I turned toward the door, my hand slipping into my pocket and running over the rough edges of the protection stone. The only thing beside the door was a pile of shoes. I didn’t think they played soccer at all. I thought the boy made Dylan THINK they played soccer. Another way of manipulating him into thinking he was just a normal kid. Things were escalating. I needed to get Dylan to drink the tea Autumn gave me. Maybe then I could convince him of what was going on.

 “Hey, I’m going to make myself some tea, do you want some?”

“No, I don’t want any tea. Jesus.”

My cheeks burned. If he wasn’t going to have any, I was at least going to make some for myself. I’d have to try harder to get his into him, but it was probably not the best time for that. He was grumpy and angry at me and was taking everything I said as a personal attack.

While the water boiled in the kettle, I pulled a mug from the cupboard and the baggie marked “P” from my purse. I turned to fill up my tea ball with it, and found the boy standing directly behind me.

“What’s that?” he asked.

“Tea,” I said, pushing past him.

“You’re lying.”

“I’m not lying, it’s tea,” I said. I measured a spoonful of herbs into my tea ball and dropped it into my mug. The boy watched me the entire time. His gaze made my skin crawl. When the kettle started to shriek, I poured the steaming water into the mug and set it aside to steep.

“Dad!” the boy cried suddenly.

Dylan rushed into the kitchen. “What? What is it?”

One side of the boy’s mouth quivered. “Mom said she’s trying to poison you. Don’t drink ANYTHING she gives you.”

With that, he turned and went back to his room, slamming the door behind him.  ",26,1732218152.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

After almost a year of self-reflection and meltdown, I (25 F) decided to create this post because I need help.

I met my boyfriend (26 M) in the summer of last year and since then I knew that he and his ex-girlfriend shared a cat. It was never a problem for me, except when months later I discovered that she still had a key to his house, where I was currently living. How did I find out? Because without consulting me, my boyfriend gave her permission to enter ""my"" house that I was also paying at the time and spend time with his animal. From then on, I began to feel uncomfortable, especially when she always went to him to solve the most banal issues (e.g. computer programs, sending memes, asking about sites where they used to watch content and even sending emails with past photos and the title ""best moments""). However, a few months ago, she found herself without a house that allowed pets and wanted to go to our current house to see her pet. I said that this was unthinkable, because I feel super uncomfortable given the whole situation. Not to mention mocked and disrespected. My boyfriend and I agreed that she would be with the animal when her house allowed it. Last month, a miracle happened: she could have the cat with her and so it was. The thing is, the next hour she was already messaging my boyfriend with all sorts of questions, including a comment about the food: ""Ahh, it's still the same..."". As you can imagine, a person who constantly tries to remind someone else of the past is someone who is not well resolved about the situation and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I don't have to be the kind of person who accepts these things and I have to feel good about my relationship, which I haven't felt for some time because of this issue. My boyfriend then told her to say goodbye to the cat because it's unsustainable to carry on like this forever. She didn't take it well, thought she was in the right and sent me messages to arrange a coffee. I refused and told her that if she wanted to say something, she was welcome to. Quoted by her: ""Honestly, you're totally in denial and I don't want anyone to suffer any consequences.... I want everyone to be able to feel good 🌿"". Still, I agreed to have a call with her, I really tried to accept her opinion and expose my own and the conversation ended with her saying that she can send whatever she wants to my boyfriend and that the cat is another subject and I have to accept it. In the end, she says I'm not mature enough. Nowadays, she says she'll return the animal next year and then she'll tell him the date, but I don't think it's up to her since the cat has a chip registered in my boyfriend's name. We don't know where she lives and my boyfriend wants to wait. My boyfriend has always defended her side, as her being an orfan person who just wants to see her animal, but all the additional content makes me see that it's not just that. I feel bad, I feel mocked and and I feel that my will is not respected. I feel like I want this to end and that I've tried to be as understanding as possible, but everyone has screwed me over in this situation. I feel my ego and my personal structure being hurt by having to accept that a person I don't know from anywhere has this power in my relationship.

I hope here is someone who can help me!

I just got my brand-new Lelit Elizabeth, my first Espresso Machine, together with a MiiCoffee D40+ grinder. I tried to dial it in, but I absolutely failed.

Whatever I do, the pressure during the extraction is very low (around 4 bar), the default setting of 6 seconds for pre-infusion is ignored (the coffee runs after 3 seconds) and after around 10 seconds I already have 45 grams.

* What I tried: put the grinder to a finer, or even the finest, setting
* tested with the blind basket - then I have a pressure of around 11 bars
* Put 19 grams into the basket instead of the recommended 18 grams maximum

As a beginner, I am now a little lost what I can do. As the pressure is high with the blind basket, I assume in general the machine should be alright. The ground coffee looks really fine. I use an auto adjustable metal tamper.

Is here someone creative with some tips what I can try? Thank you all in advance!

**I let my cheating boyfriend drown \[part 2\]**

It's a strange feeling, sitting on the beach as Chris sits somewhere at the bottom of the sea. I loved Chris, but he just pushed his luck a bit too far with me. Going behind my back, sleeping with my best friend, and playing both of us for fools. As I sit on the beach watching the waves crash over the shore, I couldn't help but feel a sense of vindication knowing that the bastard would never do this to anyone else. No other girl will ever feel the sting of betrayal at the hands of that conman. No one else besides Samantha, my best friend, who wrapped her legs around my 'loving' boyfriend. Although I felt that there would be some sense of justice when Samantha found out Chris had drowned, it wouldn't be enough, I felt this extreme desire to watch her sink to the ocean floor. I needed her to die. I pictured her body floating lifelessly amongst the waves. Visions of her blood mixing with the sea salt filled my brain and a tingle of satisfaction coursed through my body. I had nothing to lose, nothing to live for anymore. My heart was ripped out and I felt this ravenous desire for bloodshed, a thirst that could only be quelled by Samantha's blood.

I took Chris's phone and texted Samantha from his number.

'Meet me at Ocean Lake beach.' The text read. Samantha being the eger loose legged whore she was responded,

""Okay see you there in a few :)""

Samantha was going to get what was coming to her and I was going to be the one to do it. I was hellbent on making her pay, but as I awaited her arrival, a voice drifted in with the swashing of the water. I looked toward the horizon, where the ghostly voice had seemingly come from, but the sea beyond the waves was calm. Something knocked against the side of the buoy causing its metal siding to give a reverberating metal ping. The little bell that chimed from the top of the buoy's angle iron protested as it shifted violently in the water. I watched as the floating metal marker slowly regained its composure. When it did all was quiet. Until a head rose from the water.

Speckles of ocean droplets shun under the bright morning sun as the water dripped off of its head. Beautiful brown eyes looked at me curiously as I caressed my knees against my chest. The figure in the water inched a smile, jagged and monstrous.

Any other sane person would've run for the hills at the sight of that pointy grin, webbed ears, and that misplaced antenna that stuck out of its forehead. But for some reason, I knew this creature would never hurt me. Its sharpened teeth signaled its evolutionary desire to rip flesh from bone, but I understood that desire. In my vengeful state, I related to its primal desire to kill.

I returned the sentiment, giving the creature a relatable smile. This thing had warned me about Chris all those months ago, but I was too stupid to listen. Thankfully my new friend here knew exactly how to take out the trash. Looking at the beast's loving eyes I felt this strange unexplainable bond, as if this thing and I were linked somehow.

I couldn't wait to see this thing pull Samantha under the waves. I imagined her struggling against the surface, gasping for air.

""Help me, Naomi! Please I don't want to die!"" Samantha would say. Meanwhile, I would stand unmoving on the shore watching the light slip from her eyes, water filling her lungs. As my demented daydream played through my head, the figure in the water lost its smile, almost giving a concerned look. For the first time, I felt this pang of judgment coming in my direction.

'What?' I questioned quietly in my mind. As I did the creature gave me a twisted look. Its head slowly began retreating into the water. I immediately shot to my feet.

""Wait where are you going?"" I shouted beyond the waves. The creature's mouth submerged under the water, and its eyes disappeared beneath the foamy sea. The last thing I saw was its bulbed antenna vanishing into the Pacific.

Without saying a word, I understood what the creature was telling me. For some reason, it was not willing to take Samantha. I immediately erupted into a panic.

""No, no, no. What do you mean? You have to take her with you. You need to drown her. I want her dead!"" I said frustratedly.

""You need to take her like you did Chris. She's a traitorous bitch who needs to die!"" I yelled furiously, like an entitled premadona. When the creature ignored me I spat out in anger, bending over and throwing handfuls of sand into the water.

""Fuck you! Leave! I don't give a fuck! Everyone does. I don't need anyone in this life. Screw you! Fuck, Chris! Samantha can... can.""

""Can what?"" A voice questioned impatiently from my back. The fistful of sand in my hand cascaded to the floor as I slowly turned to see the person who'd interrupted me, as if I already didn't know. My eyes slowly drifted up from the sand, meeting a pair of feet, trailing up her jeans, and stopping at the sight of a familiar hoodie—Chris's hoodie, a black Nike pullover. Samantha's eyes looked at me with rage.

""Samantha can what?"" She repeated distastefully. Her sudden appearance had caught me off guard, my words caught in my throat. She crossed her arms awaiting a response while sizing me up head to toe, like the queen bee she thought she was. When her eyes looked to my feet something caught her attention.

""Is... Is that Chris's phone?"" She said as her face drooped in mild worry, gesturing to the iPhone lying in the sand. An idea drifted into my head. A mischievous smile slid across my lips, my eyes looked into Samantha's worried expression.

""Yeah, it is,"" I said delightedly, Savoring the way Samanth's face contorted as the words burrowed into her ear and down her spine. I swear I heard Samantha's heart thud against her chest, speculation causing her to lose her cool. She bit her lips, afraid to ask the question festering on the tip of her tongue. Until finally,  

""Why do you have Chris's phone?"" She said, trying to faint a confident tone, a tone betrayed by a crackle of worry. I know that look all too well. It was the same look I had on my face when I heard her moans through the door of her bedroom, the pain that reverberated through my body when Chris's name freed itself from her throat. I remember trying to deny reality in that instance, those same insecurities playing in Samantha's mind before me.

'Why does she have Chris's phone? Where is he? Is he cheating on me?' Her eyes scanned the beach, looking for any sign of Chris. The irony, no the audacity, of the situation almost made me laugh.

'If only she knew what happened to her little 'boyfriend'.' I thought as I looked over my shoulder at the endless body of water at my back.

'If only she knew.' I mussed.

I turned back to Samantha, her arms caressing her own elbows, trying not to jump to conclusions.

'Oh honey, it's exactly what it looks like and so much more.'

It would only take the truth to topple her sanity.

'He came crawling back to me yesterday. He begged for me to take him back... He's dead.'

The words danced on the end of my tongue and visions of her falling to the ground in a gut-wrenching cry clouded my eyes, but I couldn't bring myself to say it. 'He's dead'. Instead, I chose to draw out her suffering. Telling her a half-truth.

""He's been with me since yesterday,"" I said, in a sassy tone. Normally I wouldn't be picking a fight but for some reason, I doubled down on that comment.

""We talked for hours. About everything. About us. About you."" The words were directed at Samantha teasingly. My hand drifted to my hair and I started to playfully twirl my locks around my fingers.  

""He had a lot to say about you,"" I added, my tongue savoring each word, Samantha's eyes glassing over in heartache.

""He said he wants to get back with me. Of how leaving me for you was a mistake. Of how he loves me more than you..."" I said. The edges of my lips curled as Samantha's mouth gaped open.

""That's-- not true,"" Samantha said dismissively, trying to convince herself that what I was saying was a lie. To my credit, Chris did say those things to me. It was only yesterday, that Chris and me walked up and down this very beach as he professed his love for me. He talked and I listened, not questioning if what he was telling me was true or not. Little that I knew, that Samantha and him were snuggling up together each night since I found them wrapped up in each other's arms. Chris got what he deserved, and while my words were clearly stinging Samantha, she needed to experience my full rage. Samantha stared blankly at the ground, studying every grain of sand as if they would give her the reassurance she was looking for. The sight of her stupid bewildered face made me so angry. I pictured my hands around her throat as the life slowly disappeared. I could feel her labored breaths as she gasped for air like a fish out of water. I imagined dragging her body to the edge of the water and letting the waves pull her into the stormy sea. A hint of trepidation clouded Samantha's thoughts and an unfiltered question directed itself my way.

""What else did he say?"" Samantha asked, denial now giving way to a fearful quiver. I took great satisfaction as she cowered before me like a sad little puppy. I could keep drawing this out, or I could go straight for the jugular. I opted for the latter. Returning a hand to my hair, twirling my curls around my finger, while suggestively biting my lip.

""Umm.. we didn't do much talking after that,"" I said, in a cutesy tone. Samantha's heart shattered before my eyes and a euphoric warmth washed across my body. That statement wasn't a complete lie. Chris has been pretty quiet since yesterday. I returned my gaze over my shoulder, wondering what my little friend had actually done with that asshole. Just as I began turning my head forward, something tackled me to the ground.

Samantha cradled me between her legs and started clawing at my face. Like a ravenous animal, she screeched at the top of her lungs, no audible words actually came out. Through the flurry of slaps, I managed to get a glimpse of the tears streaming down her cheeks. I took great satisfaction in her pain, so much so that the world seemed to be at a standstill. I watch the seagulls circle overhead, behind Samantha's head. I'd never actually seen them like this before, staring straight up and the cloudy sky as their white wings rode the cold breeze into the sky. In that instance, I was never more at peace. A moment was cut short when Samantha started pressing two thumbs into my eye sockets, sending the world roaring back into my ears.

""You bitch!"" She screamed. I felt my eyes being shoved to the back of my skull as she pushed them in with all her might. The pain finally made an appearance and I instinctively grabbed her wrists trying to pry her hands away.

""Get off!"" I yelled as a starey black fog danced behind my eyelids. Obviously, Samantha paid me no mind. Her thumbs still pressing into my eyes she lifted my head and began bashing it against the soft sand.

'Thud, thud, thud.' The pain radiated from the back of my skull. If this was concrete I would already be dead.

Samantha gave a primal war cry, as instinct propelled me to grab a fistful of sand, smothering it into her eyes. When I did, the light returned to my vision. Samantha desperately tried to clear the debris from her face. I saw my opening and pushed her off of me, her back meeting the sand. Despite the sand in her eyes, they widened as I raised a hand over my head, bashing a fist to the side of her cheek. The impact made her head thwart backward, that stupid bewildered expression plastering across her face again. It made me so angry. I continued to hammer her face.

""Stop! What are you-- 'Bash'"" She tried pleading but my fist shoved the words back down her throat.

""Naomi please-- 'thud, thud'"" It felt so good to watch her squirm and fight as she tried to escape.

""Naomi! 'smash, smash, sma--'"" While one of my fists blackened her eye a cold voice rode the early morning sea breeze and halted my fist.

""Noooo."" It hissed in a ghostly tone. I paused for a second before raising a fist above my head fully intending to knock Samantha's teeth down her throat, but before I could bring it down, I felt an intense pain in my head, it was like someone was drilling directly into my skull. As I reached for my head in an attempt to quell the pain that same ghostly voice whispered into my ear.

""Noooo."" It said. But this time it wasn't alone. It was as if the voice reverberated in my skull, bouncing off every inch of my cranium, causing the sound to sound like a chorus of hissing.

""Noooo."" They all said. The voices made me take to my feet, hunched over in pain.

""Stop, stop, stop,"" I said, begging for the voices to quit. To my relief they did. The intense migraine slowly started to dissipate and the cloudy haze in my eyes drifted away. When I managed to take in my surroundings I saw a bloody figure at my feet. Samantha was lying there, trying to scramble to her feet as she spit out a mouthful of blood.

""You dumb bitch!"" Samantha spat out.

""You're going to get what's coming to you. I'll make sure of it. When Chris is done playing with his little whore, he'll come find me."" Samantha said woozily, her feet struggling to stay underneath her. As I watched her make her way up the beach, something came over me.

""He's never coming back. You'll never see him again."" I yelled as Samantha disappeared over the sand berm. The adrenalin started to flush out of my system and I felt the pain of bruised knuckles, when I looked down I saw one of the indentations of Samantha's teeth etched into my skin. I massaged my hand and turned back out to the ocean. The waves had quieted. There was no sign of life, gulls, no creature. Only the sound of the rhythmic gurgling of foam against the yellow tsunami buoy and the occasional ding of its little bell. I sat there for another few hours thinking about what just happened.

It wasn't until the sun was brushing up against the horizon that I finally snapped out of my trance.

Dusting myself off I made my way up the beach. I climbed my porch steps now starting to feel guilty. It's funny how rage makes you so sure of your actions. Now that I had gotten my revenge on Chris a mix of contradicting emotions came over me. I don't know what had gotten into me. I was not a violent person, but here I was, a possible accomplice to murder. On top of it all I had basically confessed to Samantha.

'He's never coming back. You'll never see him again.' What the hell was I thinking? How long until someone reported that scumbag missing? Samantha was a dud, but even she was capable of making the connection between my statement and Chris's disappearance.

My mind drifted to Samantha herself. Although I hated Samantha with all my being, I felt sorry for her. She'd been my friend for most of my life and I would've killed her if it wasn't for the voices in my head. The whole situation became too hard to process and my hands draped over my eyes as tears started to stream down my cheeks.

""Chris is... dead,"" I whispered, breaking out into a guilty weep.

""I killed Chris."" My lamenting voice quivered.

""Oh God, I killed Chris,"" I repeated in disbelief. Paranoia fully engulfed me. Someone's going to start asking questions about where he'd run off to. His roommate, Samantha, his work.

""I'm fucking screwed. I'm so fucking screwed."" I said as I paced up and down the length of my living room. My mind drifted to all the possible ways I could be implicated in the crime. Of our text messages, our recent calls, and the fact that I was probably the number one suspect when people started to ask questions. Suddenly, a spine-chilling realization drifted into my head.

'Chris's phone. Where is it?"" I frantically search my place hoping to find it under the couch cushions, in a drawer, anywhere. To my dismay, it was nowhere to be found. I suddenly remember having it on the beach with me earlier that day, the evidence that I was the last person to see Chris alive stored in its contents.

I pictured it lying up against the soft sand, of it being found by some random beachgoer, and them turning it into the police. I instantly darted to the sliding door, thrusting it open, and running into the cold ocean breeze, but just as I walked through the doorway I smashed into something hard. The impact made me fall to the floor. When I lifted my gaze a scaly figure stood in the frame. A familiar jagged smile greeted me. My gaze made its way down the creature's body and stopped when it reached its clawed hands. In its right hand was Chris's phone, in the other, Chris's severed head, still oozing blood. I crawled backward, back into the center of the living room, but the creature followed, taking squelching steps as its wet feet pressed up against my hardwood floor. The dribble of Chris's blood was not far behind.

""What are you doing here?!"" I said, unafraid of the creature but certainly wary of the severed head. The beast towered above me. With an outstretched claw, it handed me Chris's phone. I took it hesitatingly. When it was fully in my grasp the creature slowly retreated back out the sliding door. I watched as the trail of blood looped back around and followed the beast out. While I was relieved, I was still paranoid of what fate would befall me. In an attempt to quell my nerves, I pocketed the phone, sat on the couch, and turned the TV on, trying to drown out the thoughts running through my head. When the image pixelated in front of me my heart dropped.

The local news was playing and on the bottom of the screen was a news bulletin.

'Headless Corpse found on Grace Hammond Beach'

Just down the road from my house.

""Fuck my life.""

**SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!**

After the events detailed above Naomi's paranoia only gets worse. She is unable to sleep and is constantly glued to news sources as police try to unravel the mysteries of the death of one of the local pediatric PAs. Naomi's Paranoia is not helped by her mysterious friend from the sea, who comes and visits her randomly throughout the course of the story. Samantha makes the connection between Naomi's comments on the beach and Chris's untimely demise. After Samantha reports this interaction to the authorities, the feds come sniffing around Naomi's beach house. While they don't find anything of note, they have their suspicions about Chris's ex-girlfriend. The lead detective seems to have it out for Naomi and he keeps her under a microscope.

Naomi starts to have these vivid dreams of the sea, of her little hometown (Lincoln City), and of murder. In particular, murdering shallow, evil men. To her surprise, these dreams may or may not be dreams at all, a conclusion she comes to when the men of her sleepy coastal town begin to go missing.

It all comes to a head when the lead detective in the case catches a woman on a surveillance video who he suspects is Naomi. This is enough evidence to put Naomi behind bars, but when an arrest warrant is served, Naomi's little friend is there waiting for the detective. As it turns out, the detective is a deplorable, nasty man with many skeletons in his closet. He gets what is coming to him by way of sea beast. Although the detective is an evil man, Naomi's brand of justice is not the brand of justice that is favored by the court system. Her face is now plastered on every news station in the Pacific Northwest, she goes on the run, but her little friend from the sea can't stray far from the ocean and is insistent that Naomi stay with her. Throughout the course of the story, Naomi's headaches get worse. The mixture of fear, stress, guilt, and an unexplainable need to stay close to her friend wreaks havoc on her health.

Skipping ahead a few chapters and toward the end of the story a grand revelation is made. Naomi was not the perpetrator of all of the murders in her town, Samantha was. The sea beast's constant visits were to protect Naomi from her friend, but the reason behind the beast's protective nature is not arbitrary. The sea beast can sniff out impending heartbreak like a shark can smell a drop of blood in a pool of water. When Naomi's heart breaks it imprints on her. Not because it wants her for itself but because it sees her as a possable candidate.Candidate for what? you may ask. Well, you see mermaids aren't born, they are made.

Naomi is greeted by the edge of the sea by hundreds of sea creatures, some touting their human forms others in creature form. Naomi battles with the implications of becoming one of them but happily accepts as the cops close in on her. Samantha on the other hand lives carefree for a time. Naomi might've made the connection between the murders and Samantha but the cops never do.

Don't worry, Samantha gets what's coming to her. Months later Naomi returns with a vengeance, luring Samantha into the water and drowning her.

I (20M) met Jon (32M) a couple weeks ago at an event at my university. We're both second years (undergrad and masters respectively) but never crossed paths more than knowing of each other. He joined me and my friends table at this event since he vaguely knew some of us and we got to talking. The day after this one friend did ask me if Jon was someone I was seeing since he had never met him, and I said no (this is important later).

Jon later texted me thanking me for letting him sit with us, acknowleding that he is older than us but also that most of the people on his course are in their 50s so it's hard to bond with them. So I didnt bat an eye when he asked to go for coffee, figuring it was just a way to get to know me.

Over the weekend we also found out we had a few mutual friends from outside of uni and were both attending an event they were hosting. We both met up there and had drinks, and I noticed the whole time he was putting his arm around me, but I didnt think much of it. (Just to be clear, we were drunk and I get touchy with friends when I'm drunk too - hugging, holding hands etc. - I didn't say no verbally but I shrugged his arm off or stepped away and he stopped after three separate times.)

He also asked me what my friends thought of him and I recounted the story from earlier of a friend asking if he was someone I was seeing and that conversation went like this

Me: My friend asked if you were someone I was seeing Jon: And what did you say? Me, scoffing: No, obviously Jon makes a face Me: haha was I meant to say yes or something? Jon laughs and shrugs

Now I'm thinking that him asking me for coffee might have been him asking me on a date, and I said yes without thinking! We had arranged it for Friday which is tomorrow, and I don't know how to feel. He's cool and I want to get to know him as a friend (which I thought this coffee thing was for) but he's too old for me and I don't see any appeal in dating him. I'm hoping this is just me reading into it too much but im gonna play it as cool as possible and act as platonic as I can, especially considering he has not once said the word date when asking to get me coffee.

All mixed in the bowl together nice. To drink, a lovely pour over coffee. On fancy time Saturdays I might yet add a toasted bagel. 

Yet every morning without fail, since the 1990's when I was a young person, I have my honey nut cheerios with broccoli. (Although I used to use ""real"" milk, until about 2017.) 

Currently, I live with a new roommate. My prior roommate became a lawyer and decided he could afford his own place. Frankly, I can afford my own place too, but I enjoy to live with a roommate, and it is good to live with someone in case you die or something so as they can notify people and you don't get found weeks later all gross. 

But anyway. This new roommate, I thought he was alright, but on Monday this week was the first time he saw me having my nice breakfast. I saw him standing in the kitchen with his arms crossed staring at me and scrunching his face. I said, what? He said, what are you doing? I was like uh...what? I'm eating my breakfast? He was like, you put broccoli in your cereal? I said sure. I always have. He walked out of the room. I was like okay, I guess that's weird.

Then the next day, Tuesday naturally, I was having my nice breakfast again same as always. He asked me could I stop doing that? I was like, what are you saying? He claimed that he was ""disturbed"" by my food choice and that it was ""weird"". I never thought about it before then but I guess it is unusual to put broccoli in the cheerios, or other cereal. But I said, why not? People will put banana in cereal and nobody bats an eye, but I do the same for a vegetable and it's mayhem town? I don't get it. He said it wasn't right to do this. 

I ignored him. The next day, this being yesterday (Wednesday), he again interrupted my nice breakfast and ""politely demands"" me to stop doing this. I said look, this is not really your business, if you don't want to like what I have for breakfast just don't come into this kitchen while I am doing it. He ran out of the room and made throwing up sounds from the bathroom. I am about 80 percent (out of 100) that was faking it.

This morning wouldn't you know it again he comes and basically begs me, emotional style, to stop it. That he was disturbed by it. This made me feel weird and afraid of him. I told him to go kick rocks.  But he told me he was going to call his parents on me. This guy is like 40. 

His parents literally called me and asked me to stop as their son has ""sensory issues"" and it would be good of me to at least eat in my bedroom if I had to do this. I hung up on them. 

I told this all to my coworkers at work today during lunch, we have a nice team lunch on Thursdays, and they all said it was weird he was reacting so intense but also accused me of being weird for putting broccoli in my honey nut cheerios and said I could be more understanding. They said I did not need to tell him to kick rocks or hang up on his parents. I said I will eat broccoli in my cheerios every day of my life no matter what and that I would put it in my will to have it served at my funeral. They said that was a weird thing to say. I guess it was.

After almost a year of self-reflection and meltdown, I (25 F) decided to create this post because I need help.

I met my boyfriend (26 M) in the summer of last year and since then I knew that he and his ex-girlfriend shared a cat. It was never a problem for me, except when months later I discovered that she still had a key to his house, where I was currently living. How did I find out? Because without consulting me, my boyfriend gave her permission to enter ""my"" house that I was also paying at the time and spend time with his animal. From then on, I began to feel uncomfortable, especially when she always went to him to solve the most banal issues (e.g. computer programs, sending memes, asking about sites where they used to watch content and even sending emails with past photos and the title ""best moments""). However, a few months ago, she found herself without a house that allowed pets and wanted to go to our current house to see her pet. I said that this was unthinkable, because I feel super uncomfortable given the whole situation. Not to mention mocked and disrespected. My boyfriend and I agreed that she would be with the animal when her house allowed it. Last month, a miracle happened: she could have the cat with her and so it was. The thing is, the next hour she was already messaging my boyfriend with all sorts of questions, including a comment about the food: ""Ahh, it's still the same..."". As you can imagine, a person who constantly tries to remind someone else of the past is someone who is not well resolved about the situation and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I don't have to be the kind of person who accepts these things and I have to feel good about my relationship, which I haven't felt for some time because of this issue. My boyfriend then told her to say goodbye to the cat because it's unsustainable to carry on like this forever. She didn't take it well, thought she was in the right and sent me messages to arrange a coffee. I refused and told her that if she wanted to say something, she was welcome to. Quoted by her: ""Honestly, you're totally in denial and I don't want anyone to suffer any consequences.... I want everyone to be able to feel good 🌿"". Still, I agreed to have a call with her, I really tried to accept her opinion and expose my own and the conversation ended with her saying that she can send whatever she wants to my boyfriend and that the cat is another subject and I have to accept it. In the end, she says I'm not mature enough. Nowadays, she says she'll return the animal next year and then she'll tell him the date, but I don't think it's up to her since the cat has a chip registered in my boyfriend's name. We don't know where she lives and my boyfriend wants to wait. My boyfriend has always defended her side, as her being an orfan person who just wants to see her animal, but all the additional content makes me see that it's not just that. I feel bad, I feel mocked and and I feel that my will is not respected. I feel like I want this to end and that I've tried to be as understanding as possible, but everyone has screwed me over in this situation. I feel my ego and my personal structure being hurt by having to accept that a person I don't know from anywhere has this power in my relationship.

I'm not sure if I'm particularly excelling at it with this post, but I'm going to give it a try.

I'm looking for new people to talk to, to have genuine interesting conversation with, to talk games and movies, to trade dog pictures, or just flirt the night away. If you can do all of these, I might just fall in love.

I'm nerdy, flirty, and more than a bit wordy. When I'm not out with my dog exploring nature, I'm probably going on long drives with good music to find a new spot or restaurant. Or maybe I'm at home with a book, a game, a movie marathon.

I work in an Alzheimer's ward so it's basically a rule that you have to be nice to me and keep me company on these long shifts of dementia.

1gwo02k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gwo02k/aitah_for_keeping_my_baby_away_from_her_father/,AITAH For keeping my baby away from her father.,"I(25F) am a FTM to Baby(3mF). I have a camera in my bedroom that is set to only record a short clip when it detects a baby crying. I use this camera to track how many times Baby wakes during the night so I do not check the recording unless there is something off about Baby’s sleeping habits like more or less frequent night wakings or having a long wake window at night. At the time of the incident Baby was 2m old and would only contact nap so I had to wait until the father Bob(30M fake name) came home to relieve me so I could shower, stretch, cook etc. I primarily breastfeed but pump sometimes so that he can feed the baby.

I for the first time got Baby to nap in her bassinet and went onto the balcony to enjoy a cup of coffee because I don’t know how long this nap is going to last. I took this time to check the night recordings to see what the trend for wake ups was for this past week. This is when I saw a daytime recording with Bob and Baby. This particular video stood out because the frame it was showing looked like Baby was moving fast. The only way I could explain it is like when you take a picture of something moving and it looks blurry or smeared. I click on the video and see Bob shaking the baby.. up and down and side to side and then he balls his fist up as if he wants to punch Baby and then he stops and just looks at her. I then go to the video before that one and it shows him patting her on the bum and the last pat was a firm slap on her bum. He then squeezes her and then it goes into the beginning clip of him shaking her. I was livid. I immediately stormed in the house and showed him the video and asked him what the F*** is this. He says I just get frustrated with her sometimes. I said you are no longer allowed around her unsupervised and some other things I won’t add here.

The entire rest of the day is me in shock looking up the symptoms of shaken baby syndrome to see if I need to take Baby to the ER. The video is dated back a few days and from what I read online if something was seriously off I would have noticed by now. I then went back into the recording and went further back and realized that the day of the incident Bob only had Baby for 10 mins. I can see me giving her to him and 10 minutes later are the videos of the incident. The camera records everytime Baby cries and it only went off when I initially handed her over and then 10 minutes later so it’s not like Baby was crying the entire time and Baby had an I’m cranky because I’m tired cry! It wasn’t even a full screaming bloody murder cry!

Over the course of about a week as the initial shock is wearing off I am just thinking of any signs that I missed. Has this happened before? I am just questioning everything. I think about the times he called Baby useless and all she does is cry and sleep. Which was true so at the time I thought nothing of it but looking back was that a sign? I think about how he would tell her to STFU (not angrily more annoyed) and how everytime he had her he would just try to get her to sleep and just be on his game or phone. The more I thought about it the more mad I got so I told him I will be filing for full custody with supervised visits until she is old enough to tell me something is wrong. That until we go to court he is to have no contact with Baby. He said that it’s not fair to keep him from his child as it was a one time thing and he feels really bad about it. So Reddit AITAH for keeping Baby away from her father. 

Edit TLDR: I caught my baby’s father shaking our baby on the nursery cam and said he’s not allowed around her until we go to court for supervised visits.",3,1732217442.0,AITAH,10,0.8,False

I’m looking for some advice. I’m in the UK and have about £300-350 to spend on a new coffee setup.

Option 1: **Used Sage Barista Pro**  
I’ve had the Sage Barista Express before and liked it, so I’m thinking about upgrading to the Barista Pro. ( usually ebay seems to be around 290-320 mark(

Option 2: **New Fellow Opus + Used Bambino**  
Or I could get the **Fellow Opus grinder** with a **used Bambino/Pro**. I’ve heard good things about both, but it’s an extra piece of gear to deal with. ( opus on sale is 144 and bambino/pro used is usually around 200 mark)

I currently have a Wilfa Svart Aroma for pour-over and want to step up my espresso game. What do you think would be the better option as I keep flipflopping

My bf can't move as his career is here. I want to move back for a few reasons, mainly financial and familia. 

Simply put i cannot afford to live here anymore. The cost of living is so extreme and i am slowly going more into debt. My bf makes over 2x what i make. We first started off by splitting our shared exspenses 50/50. When i confided in him that i was not doing well fincially, he graciously agreed to amending how we split our shared exspenses. I now payless then half the rent but we still split groceries ect. evenly. Even with this new arrangement i am still slowly falling behind. I am the type of women who does not want to rely on a man for fincial support. I feel like it would be unfair to ask him to take on more costs. The place we live has a very high cost of living compared to the province we moved from. My bf would not be able to move back with me as his career is here and his career has no opportunities in our home province. My bf has said that i should find a different job that will pay me more. I have looked around and mostly everything would pay me the same or i am not qualified for the position. I also dont see the point as he has mentioned that his career might be moving us to a remote part of the country where the cost of living is also extremely high and the job opportunities are even less. He said that we would be moving in early spring so i dont see the point of switching jobs when we would be moving soon anyway. Plus the experience i am getting at my job is valuable and will eventually lead to higher pay. I have been thinking of getting a second part-time job to help out with my finances, but worry this will wear me down even more. 

The familia reasons are that i miss my family dearly. I come from a large family and we are all very close with one another. My family is very important to me and i feel like i have missed out on alot of family milestones. I try to attend all the big ones but that contributes to me not being able to financially afford it here. My family is not well off fincially but they have helped with my travel costs at times. My sister whom i am very close with has gotten married and has had a baby, alot of which i feel i missed out on. I feel like i am missing out on knowing who my niblings are as i was very close and use to babysit my siblings children and have a great relationship with all of them. I have missed birthdays and big family holiday events. All of this i knew i would be missing out on when i moved and i had thought i would be okay being the distant aunt but i am not. I miss the emotional support that i would receive from my family. I miss being able to go over to my grandmother's house for coffee and card games. I didnt know it when i left but my family is my support and being so far from them is painful. My bf doesnt like most of my family and i had been okay with that because not everyone can get along all the time. I thought ppl were entitled to there own opinions and that it didnt have to effect my opinions on anyone. Now I am starting to think that this is not the right way to have a relationship. I think that people in a relationship should at the very least have a cordial relationship with each others families.

Background on our relationship. We have been together for about 7yrs, living with eachother for about 6yrs. We have had a very tenuous relationship with multiple breakups and makeups. We have a dog together that we both adore (but im willing to admit that she's more his than mine).  and moved to this province about 3yrs ago for my bfs career. We just never seem to be able to resolve any of our issues. The last time we broke up was less than a year ago and i had moved out of the house for 4 months. That break up was the worst of them all. I wont go into detail but i thought it was the best decisions for both of our sanity. I could tell he was reaching his limit. We stayed in contact and went to couples counselling and worked on the relationship. Since getting back together we have had some rough fights. Our sex life has disappeared, i know this is my fault. I do not have the labido that i once had. Im exhausted all the time, and to be frank sometimes i feel like he doesnt even want me. I have for the longest time felt like i do not satisfy him, that i am gross and  ugly. I dont know how to change the way that i have been feeling towards sex. 

I am hoping to receive some unbiased opions on what i should do. If i do decide to move back home i dont know how to without it becoming a big blowup like it has in the past. I am hoping someone has advice that can help me make a decision. I dont think its fair to him that i constantly have one foot out the door, i dont know how to fix our relationship. He's an amazing man and I love him so much, we have been through alot in our relationship. I dont know if i should continue fighting and working on this relationship. I feel like i am bringing him down. Like i am a burden.",3,1732217370.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

When he fills his bottle in the morning it's with hot coffee straight from the pot, and he likes that his current container isn't insulated and lets the coffee cool.

As a little background:

To move in with my boyfriend, I had to leave my country so we can have a flat together in Germany. I know some German, can talk about some subjects, but I do have lacking vocabulary from not using is for a year. 

Important thing to note: I suffer from autism, C-PTSD, depersonalization/derealization disorder and am actively trying to get disability assistance from the government.

The roommate, let's call her Sisi, is an elderly woman, over 60yo, and she has NO LIFE. Sisi would always have her door wide open and when she noticed anyone stepping into common space she would immediately vent about how tired she is, how she has ""difficult body work"" and how awful our current flat is, how terrible her life is etc.

Despite her annoying behavior like, always using the bathroom and leaving tap flow open for over ten minutes while being on her phone in her room  -  but don't you dare think that she is done, or she will rant about anything you don't want to hear - and randomly stealing 30 min of your life by her speeches, she was sufferable. I could be irritated, but I would listen to her bullshit rant I've heard over 20 times already and just go on with my day without any problems. She didn't care if we say or do anything later. She can tell you to throw out the trash, you do so, and she'd start yelling how much you fucked up a single task. But I took it as ""old lady with dementia"" talk, so it was bearable.

That is, if she treated me like a human, then it would be bearable. She is incredibly xenophobic and since I'm not German, nor am I fluent in German, she pours all of her frustrations on me. 

So I became her target, and she made it clear how she both despised and envied me. Why envy? In our current place we have cockroaches, no thermal isolation, old and barely working equipment and a *guy* who keeps stealing our cutlery and food and is always drunk or high and highly aggressive. 

So my boyfriend and I are moving out of here in a week, after 3 months of intensive flat searching with the possibility of homelessness hanging over my boyfriend's head. It was exhausting and terrifying, but we made it; Sisi however didn't. She apparently has been also searching for a studio for over 6 months but keeps either being rejected for having large debts towards her previous landlords, or she declines the offer because water has the wrong type of heating system; that includes radiators. So she stays in our current shithole, being more miserable by the day.

Considering all of this, I was her best 'target'. Normally she would just approach me and vent, but gradually it developed into having problems with me over me opening and closing the door to my room as I'm walking for example to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Then she straight up started ordering me to clean the sink, because there were hair after recent haircut that I've done; I've cleaned it on spot because that was reasonable; but later her cleaning orders were less and less reasonable.  

She had more complaints, that I've opened the bathroom window to let in some fresh air, that I wash the dishes too loud, that I don't clean the dirt on the kitchen floor (I had nothing to do with it) etc.

I was patient with her, as she was just an old, lonely lady that had no control over her life, so she tried to control mine. When I told her I don't have time to talk due to my work, she suddenly kept mentioning that she had worse job, true job not like me. She is a classical 'one-upper', perfect victim and a winner of trauma Olympics. 

3 days ago during one of the speeches Sisi lashed out on me when I said that I understand that she feels bad she laughed at my face saying ""you? You don't understand ANYTHING. You can't speak German"" (the entire conversation was indeed in German) 

I was furious. I felt offended beyond anything. She was laughing in my face, knowing full well I go above and beyond so *she* can understand me. I know that my emotions were overboard for that simple situation, however I must mention that I have severe anger issues, which after over two yours of therapy are better. Knowing I was reaching my control's limit at that moment, I simply deleted myself from that situation, so I don't do or say something I'll regret and remained furious for the next 8h. 

After that incident, I decided to stop speaking to her in German, using my native language instead. Believe it or not, she suddenly told me that she knows that I know German and can speak it, later demanding me to do so. It was my petty revenge, so I kept ignoring her. That day, my therapist suggested that petty revenge only makes my anger worse and that it would be better if we talked like adults. I was very opposed to that idea because I knew talking to her would make it worse. 

Today's morning at around 10am I was washing the dishes, and she demanded me to mop the floor, call it pride or self-respect or even high ego, but I denied because it wasn't my mess. IT WAS HER MESS. She didn't screw the laundry machine tight enough and during laundry water started to leak from under the machine. Dirty water. 

She kept guilt-tripping me, and at one point she started screaming at me. I, having a change of heart, dropped the petty revenge and told her in German that I won't do it, that it is the last time she hears me speaking  German until she apologizes. She chuckled at the idea and told me she has nothing to apologize for, and then she kept yapping the same stuff about her making money with hard labor while I just sit in front of the computer. How she can't clean alone, that she isn't our made, how in my new flat I can have the worst mess possible but being here I must clean like the others. It is important to mention, however, that I am only a guest at this house until we get the keys to our own flat.

I know I don't owe her any explanation but after another ten minutes of yelling I flat out told her that I'm disabled and can't do certain things (lately my nervous system has been acting up when I randomly lose control over my body) and at that time I felt like I was about to throw up.  But she just looked at me like I was saying an unfunny joke and then told me she doesn't believe me, and during this whole conversation I would've already been done mopping the floor. I was so close to just give in and just do it, but then I got nauseous, and my libs started uncontrollably shaking. I was close to collapsing on the floor and either threw up or cry and scream out of fear, and I think the only two things that helped me to not collapse was the knowledge of hundreds of cockroaches living somewhere in the kitchen and my other roommate helping me to my bed. 

The situation caused me a massive panic attack to the point that I had to take my sedatives. And here's my question: was I the asshole for not giving up and protecting my boundaries, or is she the asshole and I just stood up for myself.",2,1732216857.0,ComfortLevelPod,0,1.0,False

I don't know what to do,"Hey, Reddit. I never thought I'd be writing something like this, but here we are. I'm a 34-year-old guy, and my wife (32F) and I have been married for six years. We’ve had our ups and downs like any couple, but I always thought we were solid. I was wrong.

Last night, I was working late (I’m an accountant, so it’s tax season and you know how that goes). When I got home, she was asleep on the couch, and her phone was on the coffee table. Normally, I wouldn’t even think to check it, but it buzzed with a message. The preview said, *'Can’t wait to see you again, babe. Last night was amazing.'*

My heart sank. I know I shouldn’t have looked, but I couldn’t help it. I unlocked her phone (we know each other’s passcodes), and what I found absolutely destroyed me. Texts, pictures, and even some hotel receipts from the past two years. She’s been having an affair with one of her coworkers—a guy I’ve met at office parties.

I woke her up and confronted her right then and there. At first, she tried to deny it, but when I showed her the messages, she broke down and admitted everything. She says she still loves me and wants to work things out, but I don’t even know where to start.

I feel like a fool. Like I missed all the signs. She says the affair started because she felt ""lonely"" while I was busy working so much, but how is that supposed to justify this? I was working hard for *us.*

I’ve already told a couple of close friends, and they’re urging me to consider divorce. I haven’t told my family yet, and I don’t know if I’m ready for that conversation. I’m heartbroken, furious, and just... lost.

I guess I’m here because I need advice. Has anyone been through something like this? Can a marriage survive infidelity, or is this the end? I don’t even know if I want to try. Any thoughts or perspectives would mean the world to me.",28,1732216815.0,AmITheJerk,54,0.97,False

Just a quick recap. 

I haven't ate food since Friday, 11/15 at 12pm. For the week prior I had been eating a healthy calorie restrictive diet of 1400-1700 calories (40% Protein, 40% Carbs, 20% Fat).

I am 26, 5'10.5"", and started Friday at 179.6lbs. I still feel fine and my body has been adapting very well. Get occasional headaches and stomach grumbling, but nothing that can't be overcome. Some electrolytes and sparking water solves those issues. 

I felt so good Tuesday that I went for a 2.5 mile run. I have had great mental clarity and felt great at times. At other points I have felt sluggish, but it does not last long. 

I have been consuming about 120-140 oz of water each day. This includes 12 oz black coffee, 16oz bottle of unsweetened green tea, lots of sparkling water and regular water. Taking 2 packets of Raw Unflavored LMNT electrolytes each day as well as the following vitamins/supplements: 1 Men's Multivitamin, 2000 IU D3, 2 Omega-3 (Pure Alaskan Salmon Oil), Iron & Vitamin C, Creatine, and Magnesium Glycinate (before bed).

Attached is everything I am taking at the nutrition value approximations. 

Have not caved to anything and going to push until I hit 7 days. This was my first time fasting over 24 hours and a great personal challenge. Wish me luck for the next 24ish hours!

Let me know any recommendations for the next 7 day fast. I plan on doing one week long at least once a year.",3,1732216794.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

To summarise my other post: I work hybrid, the team is scattered, every meeting I have is on Teams, my manager works in another office. I touched upon the fact that I sit alone at a hot desk and often I won't have others sat with me because they are also hybrid or if they are there, they're often going to their in person meetings.

I have no dealings with anyone directly in this office and therefore I'm struggling to build relationships and I can't work out if it's my failing or not. I'm starting to get quite self-conscious that I've not massively integrated and it's been six months now. It's slightly better being on the hot desk as in my first month I was put in an office on my own.

Compare to my last job which was fully on site and I had really good relationships with my wider team, other departments because I worked in tandem with them and could just go over to them, had to liaise with managers for meetings etc. so built friendly relationships there, had in person meetings etc. Would even go out for lunch and coffee with others in the office and even went out together a few times.

In this job, I am sat in a corner on my own and if I wanted to join any conversations I feel like I'd have to shout across the office and I am more on the introverted side but can be quite chatty once I'm friendly with someone.

For me, I build relationships by working with people and building the relationship naturally from there. I'm not great at just going up to people without any particular reason to, so apart from saying hello and maybe the odd pleasantry in the kitchen I'm not sure what else to do.

I'm overwhelmed on trying to upgrade my machine/setup. I only make lattes. Sometimes my 2year old helps with pressing buttons or pouring water. The time from start to finish including clean time is probably 5 to 7 minutes. I fill the milk resevoir up to full and do 2 to 2.5 cycles depending and it fills up my one giant ""FRIENDS"" Central Perk mug. I do not bother with latte art yet. Maybe when kids are older so no need to consider that for this upgrade.

Process: Add water into back resevoir and turn on the machine. Pour milk into the milk resevoir, put together the parts (that were previously taken apart for previous clean), add ground coffee and put all the parts on the machine and then 2 rounds of double pressing the latte button once its heated. I then take all the pieces apart and rinse with hot water.  
*\*I wanted to include my process to show somewhat what I'm used to/ok with doing in the upgrade\**

I like the stainless steel part of this machine as its longevity and ease of cleaning is nice. But areas touched by milk have created a buildup even with INSTANTLY rinsing with hot water from day one. When I noticed it the first time I scrubbed and scrubbed (where the steamy milk comes out of) with a tiny brush, but it seems to come back so quickly now.

Looking to upgrade and preferably not spend over $500 (or anywhere near it if possible lol)

1gwnjao,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gwnjao/everyone_says_im_right_but_i_feel_awful/,Everyone says I'm right but I feel awful,"In March this year I (28m) met a woman (24f) on a dating app. We talked through text for about a month before finally meeting up. She was more beautiful in person than any of her pictures. We went to get mexican food, and after a short awkward time we began to really hit it off.
 

I hadn't been in a serious relationship in 3 or 4 years by this point. The last personality I had been with was very verbally abusive and even punched me in the mouth once for accidentally pulling her hair while getting comfortable in bed. I was understandably careful afterward.
 

Anyway, the date went well, we grabbed a coffee and saw a movie... we sat and talked and kissed etc. It was great. We saw each other again several times. Eventually, she trusted me enough to meet her son (2m) and I ended up spending the weekend at her parents house while they were out of town, as she lives with them due to being a single mom with a young child.


Things were going well. And then... they weren't. I worked a VERY physically demanding job at the time, and had a catastrophic accident at work nearly a year prior that damaged my neck, back, and right knee. I came to stay with her one time and was physically exhausted and in pain. I gently turned down physical intimacy, at which point she became very silent and angry. I was very sad about this. Eventually I gave in. This happened a few times. Then, one day a few months into the relationship, I don't remember the details very well.. she punched me out of anger for this because she felt slighted that I didn't want sex. I told her If this EVER happened again I would be leaving and never coming back. She never hit me again.


However, a week or so after this she woke up in a horrible mood and her son was cranky and clingy that morning. She kept becoming frustrated with him. He followed her to the bathroom and I heard her become angry and saw him slam backwards onto the ground and begin crying. In my heart I knew what had happened, but I suppose I was in denial. 


Several months later, we were trying to get him to go to sleep and he was fighting hard. I was frustrated with her anger as well as his rolling and fighting, so I got up to go to the bathroom. I then heard a loud boom as if something smacked a wall with force and some crying, so I asked her what the hell the noise was. She said he had had a tantrum and slammed his head into the drywall. This did not sit right with me. 


Throughout the relationship I had been struggling with depression after having to come of of my medications due to leaving my job. She continued to think of this as me being distant. I had a hard time holding and cuddling her at night due to my pain, and she would act angry and hurt that I didn't spoon her constantly. She said I was distant because I didn't always immediately run to her when I came home from work and hug and kiss her, no matter what was going on. She expected me to stay with her parents and herself all the time even though I lived half an hour away and work was an hour commute. I felt like I always had to be on her schedule, or she would become upset. This continued for a while.


Over time our sex life progressed. Some days things felt fine. However, some days I felt like she was only doing it for herself and my needs weren't feeling met. One of the last times this happened, I couldn't place why but as she was the one doing the work, I felt sick. Everything felt wrong. It was almost an out of body experience. I had to keep my face straight and pretend to enjoy this but in my mind I just felt hurt and disgusted and I still can't come to terms with why I felt that way.


I had gotten my stuff and made some distance a month prior because things felt hard and I wanted to separate some and spend some time working on the relationship. We slowly progressed back to the old ways of me being there all the time because I loved her and didn't want to hurt or disappoint her. 


One morning we had another rough spot with her child that caused an argument between us, so that day I politely texted her that we should put some time aside to talk things over and try to fix the relationship. I came over that night after work, and we had a somewhat normal afternoon, but she felt distant. I will admit the last few weeks I had been in a horrible mood and grumpy. I put it off to losing my job and no longer being able to take my antidepressants. That night, after we had gotten her son to bed, she finally opened up about things. She was upset because I had said she felt clingy when I needed to rest in certain positions.

 She was angry and felt slighted that I had said this and that I hadn't been in a good mood. She became more aggressive, at which point I unfortunately began raising my voice to try to make my point. She kept yelling for me not to ""talk to her that way"" when I really hadn't been all that bad and I was simply matching her tone. She didn't accept this and continued to aggressively turn this on me. I felt attacked as I had come over just wanting a normal day and had felt like it was a peaceful and decent afternoon until this point. After all the arguing she asked if I would like to play the video game on the switch that we had been playing and I politely said if it's alright with you, no I don't really. She then became angry and aggressive again. 

Her words were slurred as if she had been taking something. I felt attacked and disgusted. I did my best to calm the situation, pulled her into spooning and we slept. The morning was no better. She was angry, her son was continuing to get her to hold him and it kept making her more and more mad. She took him out of her room to tell his grandmother goodbye and in the hallway I heard a slam and screaming crying. Her mom asked what had happened and she said that he had been ""throwing himself around and having tantrums all morning""... he hadn't. He had just wanted his mother to hold him.  

She left for work and I played in the bed for a while. I heard her mom and dad getting ready for work. Something came over me, and I began shaking out of adrenaline or anxiety. I walked to her parents door. ""I'm sorry but I have to tell you this."" I explained about the times I thought she had hurt her son. I explained that I believed it more by the fact that she had hit me prior. I explained that I thought she had done it again this morning. Her mother seemed to suspect the same and her father never said one word to me. I said that I should go and I left quickly, forgetting some important items on the way out. 


I texted her on my way home and told her I loved her very much but I needed to break up with her and I am so sorry. She tried to call but I couldn't answer. She texted and pleaded but I couldn't answer. The continued to text me how i had hurt her so much and that it was all my fault and that I would never see her son or her ever again. I still couldn't make myself answer and I don't know why. 


The last text she sent me was ""I hope you hurt more than you hurt me."" Almost a word for word quote of my ex who punched me in the face years prior after she had done it. And she knew this.


I feel like such an asshole. I feel so guilty for leaving and hurting her. I miss having someone to come home to and I had always wanted to be a father. I loved her son so much and wanted to marry her and become his dad and have more children. I had so many plans for our life. And now all I feel is hurt and guilt. I wish I had never started dating again after the first abusive ex. It has to be my fault, how could I pick so wrong multiple times?

Been “off” when I was pregnant or nursing. And now I’m getting back into the swing *again*. After 6 kids and being back at my heaviest weight I’m all in getting myself back. My BP was elevated and about stage 1 hypertension which is new for me and that is scary and putting my health into perspective (because my dad in January was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney failure due to unchecked and unforeseen hypertension). My hormones are starting to get balanced and figured out. Been doing 16:8 for the last month or so. Slowly feeling better. But this last week I did my first 72 hour fast. And I actually felt amazing. I think what helped was lots of herbal teas and good salt with my water. I have been walking 30 mins everyday. And going to the gym once a week (soon 2x a week). I cut out caffeine and coffee  completely (my body does not like caffeine even tho I do😂) My BP was at the healthiest level after my first fast and that was super encouraging. I lost 10 pounds in a week. Also super encouraging. And I’ve been getting really good sleep and rest at night. But I have a couple questions that I’m hoping you guys may have some experience with:

1. I feel like I have a lot of brain fog. I *feel* good but my eyes feel heavy and tired. Does this eventually go away?

2. After my long fast I felt worse after I ate. I broke it with a very clean well rounded meal with no sugar or anything processed. Should I have broken my fast with something easier like broth then waited a bit before consuming a full meal?

Within these short pages, I will briefly touch on my life before, during, and after the Army. My younger years are but a memory now—a fragmented mosaic of hardship and resilience. I endured the worst of treatments, fueled by extreme hatred toward me. My only crime? That I was alive and existed.  
  
I can honestly say I never heard my mother utter a kind word to me. Her most frequent refrains were: ""I hate you,"" and, ""You were a mistake. I wish you were never born."" These words cut deep, becoming the soundtrack of my early life.  
  
I don’t remember much about my father except that I was named after him. He was absent, leaving my mother to raise me alone. My first stepfather is little more than a shadow in my memory. A Vietnam vet from the Army, he fathered two of my half-siblings: Juan and Geneva Otero.  
  
However, my second stepfather, Thomas Rivera, remains vivid in my mind. My earliest memory of him is a defining moment that shattered my innocence.

One day, Thomas came home from work, and I ran up to him, arms open wide. I hugged him and called him Dad. That was a mistake. He hit me so hard that my eye blackened, and my lip split open.  
  
I used to be a happy boy with a smile that lit up my face. But over time, I stopped smiling. I learned that joy invited pain. When my siblings and I had to speak to him, we were required to stare at the floor, address him as sir, and stand with our hands behind our backs.  
  
My mother had two more children with Thomas: Little Tom and Amalia Rivera. His methods of punishment were brutal. He used a few fan belts taped together to create a switch. When he was enraged, the beatings lasted 10 to 15 minutes—sometimes even longer.  
  
My mother was no less cruel. She fashioned her own version of the switch, using a two-foot piece of fan belt taped to a stick. To protect her hand, she’d wrap it in a towel before swinging. Worse, we were forced to drop our pants, exposing our skin from calves to lower backs to maximize the pain.  
  
This was just one of the many torturous punishments we endured. Each one stripped away another piece of who I was—a once-happy boy transformed into a quiet, guarded shell.  
  
Page 3  
We were never allowed to make friends. If we did, there was a risk we might confide in someone. Talking to the neighbors was practically forbidden, and relationships of any kind? Absolutely out of the question.  
  
By the time I was 12, I was already paying into social security, working in the groves and fields. I picked cucumbers, squash, okra, oranges, grapefruits, watermelons—you name it. It was grueling labor, and while most kids my age were learning multiplication or worrying about who to sit with at lunch, I was learning how to endure back-breaking work.  
  
My stepfather, Thomas Rivera, was from old Mexico. Not that it meant much to me—it was just another fact about the man who loomed over my life. Around the age of 13, I hit a breaking point. I tried to kill him.  
  
He always kept a double-barrel shotgun loaded, and I thought that night would be the end of him. But there must have been some trick to it because it didn’t fire. Needless to say, there were consequences. I was out of school for a month, and the violence in my home only escalated.  
  
It wasn’t just him. I’ve tried to kill each member of my family in one form or another—desperation driving me to the edge. Despite the chaos, I did attempt to experience some semblance of normalcy, even trying to have a girlfriend at school. But that, too, ended in punishment.  
  
I’d written a love note and hid it in my dresser. My half-brother Juan found it and, of course, showed it to Mr. Rivera. That beating was unlike any other. It wasn’t just physical; it was the last time I’d allow myself to believe in something innocent like love without the shadow of fear.  
  
Page 4  
That same school year, when I was 14, I discovered I had a sister and brother—Selena and Bryan Frost. They were my father’s children, and the revelation was both shocking and oddly amusing. Here I was, the oldest of seven kids, but the only one with pure, unshared blood.  
  
To my surprise, I also learned that my father’s mother—my grandmother—lived just behind us. Her house stood among a row of homes on the other side of the pasture. I didn’t know much about my father other than what Selena told me and a photograph she showed me.  
  
The years crawled on until I was 15. By then, Tommy’s beatings had pushed me past my limit. One night, while he and my mother were out at the bars, I made my move. I slipped out of the house, crossed the pasture, and knocked on my grandmother’s door.  
  
That moment changed everything. She helped me make arrangements to leave Florida behind for good. They bought me a Sony Walkman, and the music from that device became my constant companion. It was in my ears from the moment I boarded a Greyhound bus until I arrived in Houston.  
  
My life up to that point had been one of isolation, deprivation, and relentless abuse. I had no ambitions, no dreams for the future. I’d been told repeatedly that I’d be withdrawn from school, so I’d stopped imagining a world beyond my misery.  
  
But Houston was different. It was there that I met my father for the first time—a man I’d only known through a photograph until then.  
  
Page 5  
Meeting my father in Houston felt strange for both of us. There was no connection, no common ground. He was absent most of the time, and even when he was around, we didn’t have much to say to each other. My year and a half there remains a blur. Nothing stands out, except that I was still drifting, still lost.  
  
Just after my 17th birthday, I found myself homeless. The streets became my home, and the woods on 1960 and Jones were abundant back then, offering some semblance of shelter. Despite everything, I managed to hold a job at the McDonald’s on Jones and Grant. I even had an apartment briefly, shared with a few friends, but it wasn’t much of a home. We partied constantly, living recklessly in the moment.  
  
I was deep into the chaos—smoking pot, drinking heavily, experimenting with LSD, cocaine, and crack. I was also deeply entrenched in the occult, dabbling in Satanism and summoning spells from the Necronomicon.  
  
One night, I took things too far. Something—or someone—was angered by my actions. I found myself violently thrown across the room, and as I stumbled to catch myself, I fell through a window. My buddies, as messed up as I was, panicked. They rushed me to the hospital, dumped me at the door, and bolted.  
  
Page 6  
I can still remember holding my bleeding arm, shouting incoherent nonsense at the top of my lungs. “I’m the devil, and I’ve come for your souls!” What was I even thinking? Nothing. That’s what. I was just your typical, messed-up bugger head, lost in the haze of drugs and chaos.  
  
Oddly enough, there was some good that came out of that madness.  
  
During my 18th and into my 19th year, three women from a local church started visiting the McDonald’s where I worked. They’d come on Wednesday and Sunday nights, staying after hours while we cleaned up. Their presence became a strange comfort.  
  
One of them, Mrs. Thornton, took a particular interest in me. After noticing the damage I’d done to my forearm from that night of reckless abandon, she insisted on taking me to the doctor. I’ll never forget how she looked at me—not with pity, but with genuine care.  
  
After one of those doctor visits, she invited me to her son’s house. At the time, I didn’t realize how pivotal that invitation would be, but it planted a seed.  
  
Unfortunately, the chaos hadn’t fully subsided. My buddies and I lost our apartment, and I was back to square one. Without a steady income, I couldn’t pay my share of the rent. Once again, I was adrift, but something inside me had started to shift—something I couldn’t quite put into words yet.  
  
Page 7  
Our furniture was sitting out on the street as darkness began to settle in. It was one of those moments where hopelessness starts to creep in. Then, as if by some divine intervention, Mrs. Thornton and her son Allen pulled up. “What are you doing?” she asked, genuine concern in her voice.  
  
We loaded the furniture into Allen’s truck and stored it in Mrs. Thornton’s garage. Despite their kindness, I wasn’t ready to give up my so-called freedom. Instead of staying at her house, I wandered off to a barn in the woods. That freedom felt hollow, though. Four or five days later, Mrs. Thornton found me again. This time, she asked me to come back with her, and for reasons I didn’t quite understand at the time, I decided to give it a try.  
  
Being welcomed so openly by Christians like the Thorntons was a shock to my system. After years of being told I was worthless, their acceptance was something I couldn’t fully wrap my head around. Over the next few months, my hand healed, and I tried to reclaim my old job, but they wouldn’t take me back. That rejection hit me hard, leaving me feeling utterly defeated.  
  
That’s when Mrs. Thornton made me an offer that would change my life. She asked me to be a part of her family—her son. She would be my mom, and I’d have two older brothers. It felt surreal, but I accepted.  
  
In August 1989, my life took another drastic turn. I found salvation and accepted Jesus into my heart. For the first time, I felt something real, something grounding. True salvation.  
  
Page 8  
The next eight years were transformative. I embarked on a 3-4 week camping trip across America, from the breathtaking Grand Tetons to the serene Glacier Lake. During this time, I also got my GED and spent two years in college at North Harris Community College, now called Lone Star College.  
  
One of my dreams was to take my mom, Mrs. Thornton, to Alaska to see the Thundering Glacier. It was the least I could do for the woman who gave me a second chance at life.  
  
After college, I landed a computer networking job at Humble ISD. I was good at it, but I let my hormones derail my career. That mistake cost me everything. Out of options, I turned to the military.  
  
I visited the recruiter’s office and took the ASVAB, scoring well enough to open up a range of opportunities. I decided to aim high: the Army Rangers. At MEPS, I scored a 110, earning a slot at Fort Benning.  
  
In November, I arrived at basic training, graduated from infantry school, and went straight to Airborne School. I barely scraped through that one. Then it was off to RIP (Ranger Indoctrination Program), which at the time was only three weeks long.  
  
I was so close. So damn close. But I didn’t pass ENTAC, the security clearance check. That meant I was sent to a worldwide assignment instead of Ranger School. I didn’t achieve my goal, but at least I gave it everything I had.  
  
Page 9  
  
After missing out on Ranger School, I found myself stationed in Korea, assigned to the 1/503rd Air Assault Infantry Regiment, Bravo Company. My first year there was one of the toughest of my life.  
  
That summer, I earned my Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB), a feat that pushed me to my absolute limits. The 12-mile ruck march was brutal. I crossed the finish line with just minutes to spare, and when I peeled my boots off, I saw raw meat where skin used to be. Mole skin didn’t help; recovery took over two weeks. But there was a silver lining—once my feet healed, my boots were finally broken in.  
  
When fall came around, I took on another 12-mile ruck, but this time I finished in just an hour and a half with a steady jog. By then, I was a PV2, standing tall with what we called the ""Tower of Power""—the confidence that comes with proving yourself.  
  
My first tour was nearing its end, but I opted to stay in Korea for another year. I took two weeks of free leave and got my pick of duty stations. This choice kept me out of Fort Drum, and during my second tour, I found myself stepping into a more significant role.  
  
Page 10  
  
Due to my background in computers, I was appointed Commo Chief after the previous guy was fired for failing a drug test. The assignment was intense—I had only three days to clean, service, and lay out the entire commo room. I threw myself into it, working tirelessly. By the time I was done, I had set a new standard for the position. My efforts earned me an Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM).  
  
But that wasn’t the end of my responsibilities. During my second tour in Korea, I wore many hats. I served as Training NCO, guide-on bearer, Company Commander’s RTO, mail handler, and Warrior Pass NCO. I immersed myself in everything the infantry had to offer, soaking up knowledge and building a strong reputation.  
  
By the end of my time in Korea, I had racked up two ARCOMs, an Army Achievement Medal (AAM), a Certificate of Achievement, several challenge coins, and glowing recommendations from every commander I served under. These accolades set the stage for my next assignment: Fort Bragg.  
  
At Fort Bragg, I spent about two years. Most of it was a blur of garrison duties, training Rangers, and jumping. Life wasn’t glamorous—I was a barracks rat and a heavy drinker. My nightly ritual was a case of Budweiser, and on weekends or holidays, I’d double that. My diet was a steady mix of coffee, ramen noodles, and tenderloin strips cooked on a George Foreman grill.  
  
One fateful road march at Bragg would change everything. I knew my knee was injured, but I stubbornly pushed through, finishing the march before the weekend. By Monday, I could barely walk. My knee was black, blue, and swollen to three times its normal size.  
  
Medical revealed the damage: I had torn my ACL, LCL, and MCL. Though they patched me up enough to keep going for a while, it wasn’t enough for the demands of Fort Bragg. My time there was coming to an end.  
  
Page 11  
  
As my time at Fort Bragg came to an end, I decided to re-enlist and make a significant change. I switched my MOS from 11B1P (Infantryman with Airborne qualification) to 88H (Cargo Specialist). It felt bittersweet—no longer high-speed infantry, but still proud to be in the Army.  
  
By the time I was stationed at Fort Eustis, VA, I had settled into the rhythm of my new role. Everything changed on September 11, 2001. That morning, I was on a gentry crane when the head Training NCO called me into the office. The TV was on, and I watched in disbelief as the second plane struck the World Trade Center.  
  
The base went into lockdown for 100% accountability, and rumors flew. Some said re-trained soldiers like me would be sent back to their original units since we were TDY. Thankfully, that didn’t happen. Instead, I graduated from my course and received orders to PCS to Fort Story, VA.  
  
Page 12  
  
At Fort Story, I spent two years sharpening my skills before the inevitable happened. Our battalion received orders to deploy to Iraq. Our mission was clear: facilitate the offloading of vital equipment needed by other units.  
  
We arrived in Kuwait on February 14, 2003. It was bitterly cold at first but quickly turned into the sweltering heat we had expected. My team and I got to work setting up at the LSA in Port Shuayba. We established choke points, emplaced gun nests, and coordinated guard shifts with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) on standby.  
  
My infantry background proved invaluable. I trained select personnel on the importance of range cards for overlapping fields of fire and seamless guard rotations. The transition from cargo operations to combat readiness was smooth—by then, I was no stranger to adapting under pressure.  
  
When the war officially began, I found myself leading convoys. The rules were simple: keep moving unless absolutely impossible. Stopping meant vulnerability. We avoided overpasses whenever possible, knowing the risks of ambushes and IEDs.  
  
Page 13  
  
Around late June or early July, one mission took a dark turn. Our convoy had to stop because another convoy ahead of us had encountered an IED, and EOD was working to disarm it.  
  
We were on the outskirts of a small town, about 300 meters from the local population. At first, some townspeople seemed to approach out of curiosity or gratitude, but the reality of war had shifted their motives.  
  
I had seen it before—people who once thanked us turning to desperate measures, using civilians as suicide bombers. As the crowd began moving toward us, every instinct I had screamed caution.  
  
The tension was palpable, and the stakes were life or death.  
  
  
The situation escalated quickly as three individuals ran directly toward me while others moved toward the other vehicles in our convoy. At about 150 meters, I raised my hands, signaling for them to stop, warning that I would shoot if necessary. Two of them halted, but the third kept charging.  
  
I continued to motion him to stop as he closed the distance, but he ignored every warning. By the time he was about 50 feet away, I had no choice but to act decisively. I charged my M16, switched to ""fire,"" and leveled the rifle, placing the buttstock firmly against my cheek. I was ready to fire.  
  
Finally, at the last second, he froze. Keeping my aim steady, I watched his every move, fully prepared to pull the trigger. Slowly, he reached into his pocket and produced a wad of money. He wasn’t a threat—he wanted to exchange his currency for American cash. I waved him away with my rifle, not relaxing until he was out of sight.  
  
Unbeknownst to me, one of my peers had been observing the entire scene. Rather than understanding the gravity of the moment, he became furious with me. He started shouting, accusing me of escalating the situation unnecessarily.  
  
I yelled back, defending my actions. Our heated exchange caught the attention of my TC (Truck Commander), who exited the Humvee and ordered him to return to his vehicle. Still, the damage was done—he reported the incident to the commander.  
  
Page 14  
  
The aftermath was tense. I was called to explain the situation in full detail. I walked the commander through every step I had taken, from the warnings I gave to the exact moment I decided not to fire. My TC and the others who witnessed the event corroborated my account in sworn statements, one of which I kept for my records.  
  
In the end, the commander ruled that I had acted appropriately and followed orders. No formal action was taken against me, but the incident left its mark. I knew from that day forward that trust within my unit was fractured.  
  
I stopped riding in the lead truck and turned in my rifle after every mission. The only time I carried it again was to escort my CO to other locations in Kuwait, but I never loaded another round.  
  
When I finally redeployed stateside, the weight of the experience began to take its toll. My commander noticed the changes in me and urged me to see a doctor. The diagnosis confirmed what I had suspected—something wasn’t right. I was flagged for reenlistment, deployment, and even weapons handling.  
  
The Army placed me on a series of back-to-back 30-day medical leaves. While my body was stateside, my mind was still in Iraq. As we discussed my experiences and the residual impact, things spiraled even further, culminating in a breaking point that would alter my military career.  
  
Page 15  
  
When my unit redeployed the following year, tragedy struck. My best friend died from shrapnel to the side of his head. Despite the odds, people can survive these kinds of injuries with the right medical care, and as a Combat Lifesaver, I knew this. But I wasn’t there with him—his soldiers were, and they failed him. He died 2 1/2 hours later, and I’ll always carry that guilt with me.  
  
I never went to his memorial ceremony. I don’t know if there were any last words in his death letter. What I do know is that the weight of his death has haunted me far too long. The Army, in their infinite wisdom, discharged me with an honorable discharge for medical reasons. But it felt more like they took an old, beat-up dog, drove it down a long dirt road, and threw it away.  
  
Since then, my life has been a blur of pain, loss, and regret. My marriage fell apart. I struggled with another one. I turned to substances—weed and alcohol—as a means to cope. I isolated myself, living far from any town, hiding from the world and, more often than not, from the cops.  
  
I was Baker Acted three times and hospitalized in a residential program four or five times.  
  
Page 16  
  
The pain didn’t stop there. I attempted suicide once, and that dark decision messed me up even more. There were at least five more attempts after that, each one hoping to succeed. I resorted to self-mutilation, distancing myself from society completely. I’d go months in the same clothes, not stepping outside, not even for a breath of air, unless it was in the middle of the night.  
  
I began to lose touch with reality. I closed my eyes and saw an afterglow of a set of woods. I’d be standing in the clearing, paralyzed with fear, unsure of what I might see if I ventured further into it. At night, the darkness became alive. I felt eyes watching me—shadowy figures, demons, angels, swirling in chaotic designs on the floors and ceilings. I started to wonder if I was losing my mind, and if I was, did that mean I was gaining something that others didn’t have? And if I had it, what was it?  
  
Page 17  
  
Camp Hope has given me another shot at life. It’s not that they hand it to me on a silver platter; it’s that they guide me to help myself. They help me reconnect with who I truly am and accept the environment I’m in. It’s like they point me in the right direction and say, “Hey, check this out. There’s something over there that might help you.”  
  
I’ve learned the power of forgiveness and love—first for myself, then for others. I’ve come back to my Lord and Savior, and I’ve been shown how to live a clean, sober, and straight life, free from the clutches of drugs and alcohol. I pray that I don’t let them down and that I honor the trust they’ve placed in me. Hooah.  
  
I can say, without a doubt, I am a better man today than I was yesterday. And when tomorrow comes, you’ll see just how much I’ve grown.  
  
Thank you all… End of the line!

You heard how he's powerful and scary, and even if you don't see him until the end, it's not like he didn't do anything, he has been influencing the evil from people's minds and animal's mind and have them attack Ness and friends, his phycick abilities is so strong, he can make inanimate objects sentient and attack Ness and friends, all from many years in the past. He's doing stuff without being scene and that's awesome! 

And when you finally encounter him, all that build up did NOT disappoint, throughout the game it's clear he was getting desperate, and its clear that he's scared of Ness and his friends cuz of what the Apple of Enlightenment told him. He was so desperate to succeed in his invasion that he grew so powerful, that only the Devil's Machine can stabilize his mind and body. But when Porky turns off this machine to reveal his new true form, all that build up through out the game, like I said, this finale did NOT disappoint, he's terrifying and you can just FEEL how powerful he is. The ambience, his attacks being an unseen random effect creating a unique challenge, the line ""You cannot grasp the true form of Giygas' attack"" always sounds awesome to me, the fact that he is represented in one of the best features of this game, as the background, is super awesome, and when you can't do anything but pray is amazing. When he is destabilizing even more after Ness' mom prayers, things felt so much more intense, the ambience is much more chaotic and louder, Giygas is flashing and is losing it, I feel like in universe, the heroes are having a harder time focusing as the energy in the air is getting heavier, and Paula's prayers getting absorbed by the darkness really feels intense and hopeless, until finally, the player, us, prays back, and that dealt the final massive blows to Giygas, finally truly destroying him and causing him to disintegrate into static.

I’m a 24-year-old man living in Gurgaon. For the longest time, I’ve been solely focused on work, striving to build a better life for myself and my family. My top priority has always been earning well, ensuring stability, and achieving professional success.

But in the hustle and grind of it all, I recently realized that I’ve been neglecting an equally important part of life – finding a life partner. It hit me that while work and money are crucial, love and companionship bring a balance that makes life truly fulfilling.

I’m still searching for love, and honestly, it’s not easy. It’s like rediscovering a part of life I had unknowingly ignored. But I’m hopeful and open to the idea of finding someone to share this journey with.

If you’re reading this and would like to grab a coffee sometime, it would be amazing. I’d love to meet someone who values both the grind and the joy of meaningful connections.

1gwn8x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1gwn8x8/time_looped_chapter_55/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 55,"*Subject is intelligent to know that magic doesn’t exist, but still chooses to use it to express serious issues. It’s possible that he uses them as a layer of protection. A layer within a layer. It would be beneficial to see if a third layer develops in the future.*

*The session’s focus was on a man, possibly a figure of power or importance in his past. The person was described as “immune” to fire. Often, he’d juggle it in an attempt to impress. When I tried to focus the conversation on the person in question, Daniel changed the topic, returning to the standard dream descriptions.*

Will put down the page and relaxed. He had spent hours going through them, and was yet to find anything particularly useful. So far, he had come across five instances of magic descriptions. They were jumbled, like a single thought cut up into pieces. When put together, they gave the vague description of a person—someone with control over fire and lightning, who was claimed to be invincible.

Taken separately, one might think of them as random dream fragments. What Will saw was the description of another class. There was no indication where Danny had come across that class—at least in the pages Will had read so far. It couldn’t be at school, and with Danny’s skill to skip the tutorial, it was possible to be anywhere.

“Shouldn’t you be heading home?” the barista asked.

Will looked glanced in the direction of the street. It was already dark. The streetlights and the coffee shop's lamps had created the illusion that it was still light.

“Yeah.” Will gathered the papers on the table.

“Homework?” The barista peered out of curiosity.

“Something like that.” He had only gotten through a fifth of the file, if that. There was a good chance that there’d be more clues. It would have been a lot easier if Daniel had simply told him; although, if he had, there was a good chance that Will wouldn’t believe him. “You don’t get many customers.”

“Are you kidding me? You’ve been here all day.”

Clearly, the definition of “many” was different for the two of them. Thinking back, Will couldn’t remember a case in all his loops that there had been anyone else present. Even the passersby were rare. It made one think of how the place managed to exist.

“Just kidding,” the barista said with a wink. “Some days are like this. At times, I can’t fit half the people who want to enter. You should see how it gets on birthdays.”

“Right.” Will grabbed his backpacks. “See you tomorrow.”

“Be safe.”

In a manner of speaking, Will could be considered a regular of the place. The only issue was that the barista had no memory of it. With the amount of money he had spent, he was probably eligible for a VIP pass.

With hours of his loop remaining, Will decided to pass through the school after all. With luck, Jace might have even fixed his dagger. If not, he might get to see some new crafter skills.

The entrance door was unlocked when he got there. His classmates hadn’t wasted their time getting to business. Knowing that Helen wouldn’t be there felt a bit off. It also meant that there would be a lot fewer goblins.

No sound of fighting could be heard in the main corridor. Will took out a flashlight and continued further again. Specks of glass near the bathrooms told him that Alex had stocked up on mirror pieces. Clearly, they had completed the first floor, which meant they must have gone further up.

“Bro!” Alex emerged out of nowhere as Will reached the staircase. “You came!”

“Hi.” Will pointed the flashlight in the other’s face. “How far have you gotten?”

“Nah, they already finished, bro,” the Alex at the staircase replied, moving out of the light. It was scary that even now, Will had no way of determining whether he was addressing the real Alex or just a copy. “There are a few of us on every floor, just in case.”

Done already? That was unexpected. Although since they had only wolves to deal with, it must have gone fast.

“Where are they?” Will asked.

“Basement, bro.”

With a nod, Will went down. Jace, Alex, and a small crowd of copies had gathered at the far end of the basement corridor. Normally, one would expect to find a crafter swinging a hammer above an anvil, or a workbench of some sort. Instead, this seemed more like a school fight.

Two copies of Alex were holding wooden chair legs, six feet away from the jock, who had no weapons whatsoever. The remaining Alexes formed a circle, watching with interest.

“Bro!” One of them shouted, causing all the rest to look in Will’s direction.

“You made it, bro!” A tsunami of greetings followed, making Will regret that he had gone to visit.

“So, you showed up, Stoner.” Jace crossed his arms.

“Had nothing better to do,” Will said dismissively. As he got near, he tossed Alex’s backpack to someone in the crowd. “What’s going on? Trying out the knight?”

Jace only smirked.

“You gotta see this, bro!” an Alex said. “It’s lit OP! For real!”

It wasn’t the first time that the goofball had described something as overpowered. The confidence oozing from Jace’s smirk, though, suggested that it surpassed most of the skills the group had used so far.

Will stopped near the ring of mirror copies and waited. On cue, the fight began.

Both copies of Alex rushed forward, making an overly dramatic and slow attempt to hit the jock on the head. At such speed, anyone could easily evade the blows even without the use of rogue skills. Jace, however, did something completely different.

Neither evading nor parrying, he reached out to grab with his left hand. Simultaneously, his right hand pulled out a handful of wires and other objects, and was also moving in the same direction.

 

**UPGRADE**

**Chair leg has been transformed into a flail.**

**Damage capacity x3.**

 

Initially, there didn’t seem to be any change. The mirror copies were still on the offensive, and Jace had merely managed to snatch a weapon from an enemy’s hand. Taking a step back, the jock swung his weapon, shattering the head off one of his opponents. It was only at that point that Will noticed that his classmate was holding a flail instead of a chair leg.

“What the hell?” he couldn’t help but mutter.

Reaching into his pocket, Jace pulled out a small chain, then grabbed hold of the flail’s head.

 

**UPGRADE**

**Flail has been transformed into a triple nunchuck.**

**Damage capacity x1.5.**

 

The weapon transformed again, just in time to block the chair leg of the second mirror copy. Things didn’t stop there. Jace took advantage of the block to grab hold of both weapons.

 

**UPGRADE**

**Triple nunchuck has been transformed into a multi nunchuck.**

**Damage capacity x1.5.**

 

The weapon transformed again as it was whisked out of the copy’s hands. One elegant swipe with it later, and Jace’s second opponent had been shattered.

“What do you think, bro?” One of the Alexes near Will asked. “Lit OP.”

There was no denying it. The new ability, or combination of abilities, was a lot more impressive than anything they’d seen up to this point. It was almost tempting to call it magic.

The thought caused a knot to appear in Will’s stomach. If crafter skills were this powerful, what could one expect from a magic user?

“Nice,” he admitted.

“Just nice, Stoner?” the other grunted. “Want to have a go?”

As fun as it was to accept, Will really didn’t. Even with such a skill, Jace’s actions remained slow and predictable. He needed to be a lot faster to make proper use of what he obtained.

“I’m good.” Will shook his head. “Did you get the knight?”

“Yeah. That helped with the wolves.” Jace tossed the multi nunchuck at Will.

Looking at it one would never guess that it had been made from a pair of chair legs. By all accounts, it was the genuine article. Will waved it about a few times, testing if anything would come off.

“It’s solid,” Jace said. “I’ve tested it.”

“Neat trick.” Will handed the weapon back. “How does it work?”

“Combat crafting,” the jock replied. “Fourth level skill. It allows me to use other crafter skills in combat. I can disassemble complex weapons before they hit me in most cases. Would be a bit more difficult without the knight’s endurance. Simple things I can upgrade, as long as I have enough components and materials at hand. Best part is that I’m not limited to a single thing.”

Leg to flail to nunchuck. It was quite the showy performance and not only for Will’s benefit. Had they known about this skill, some of the fights would have been a lot easier. It was their fault for taking things for granted. Everything they knew suggested that the crafter had to be a passive participant that supported the other three. As it turned out, he was quite menacing in combat as well, but only after a certain level.

“Your dagger, Stoner.” Jace said, ending Will’s train of thought. “Couldn’t make anything fancy with what I had.”

“Eternal weapon,” an Alex said in-between eating a muffin. “We need eternal materials to make an eternal upgrade. So, we just did an eternal repair.”

“Is it bad that I could understand that?” Jace whispered, as he glanced at the Alex in question. “But yeah. Try not to break things. Repair might not work each time. When I repaired the dagger, I got a tutorial bonus.”

Will took his dagger. It felt exactly as he remembered it, but his mind remained elsewhere. There were six wolf mirrors in the school, which meant that a person could level up four times. One level had to be reserved for the rogue so that he could throw and evade. The remaining three were just enough to reach level four with the crafter and get the skill that Jace had mentioned.

*It’s all just pieces*, Will thought.

The tutorial was just a puzzle with multiple answers. With enough persistence and a bit of luck, it was possible to defeat an enemy in a way that wasn’t envisioned. Yet, with the right combination of skills and items, the same fights could have been won with minimal effort.

“Guys,” he said. “I need to borrow your skills next loop.”

All eyes fell on him.

“There’s one thing I need to try. I’ll let you have the rogue the loop after that.”

“What’s the plan, Stoner?”

“There’s no plan. I just want to test something. Alone.”

“Bro wants to try out four classes at once.” Alex came to the rescue. “Sure, you can borrow mine.”

It was a classic manipulation. He had provided a plausible explanation and then gladly offered his class without being asked. This way, if Jace were to refuse, he’d look petty and unreasonable.

“Your class for one loop?” the jock asked, already considering the deal. At this point, he had already internally agreed to it, and now was just wondering if he couldn’t haggle a bit for a better price. “And one more when I need it.”

“You got it. Just one more thing. Keep it from Helen. I don’t want her to find out yet.”

“You’re playing a dangerous game, Stoner. You don’t keep the quarterback out of the game.”

“I’ll keep her in the loop, just not yet. We’ll need to be at our best against the boss.”

“Come on. How hard can the fucker be? The three of you killed one. With four of us, it’ll be easy.”

If only it were so easy.

“I’m not sure,” Will said. “According to the hints, there are seven weapons that will help us defeat the boss. It’s safe to say that we’ll get the last one from the vice principal’s mirror.”

“So?”

“We only used three against the hidden boss. Also, at no point did eternity tell us we had to use any.”

TL;DR: potentially got lovebombed with mixed signals and then dropped. now just asking myself ""why?"", 

· was she really playing games? 

· should i honestly tell her i felt overwhelmed the whole time?

· should i tell her i think shes been playing me for attention?

there was a girl (f,20) whom i (m,23) didnt pay any attention to in my polish speaking course. 
later when i sat eating at a food stand next to uni, a guy sat down right at the next table and she also sat there, turning out to be her colleague.

i just said ""hey, arent u in my polish course?"" and she said yes. we had a bit of small talk and she told me her native language, which i knew 2 sentences in. 
i didnt think and casually just said the extremely direct and naughty sentence which only we both could understand.
which made here blush and laugh at the same time, having difficulty holding her drink in. 
the 2 guys didnt understand so it was a bit of an inside joke. 
i went on with my day.

next lesson time she just sat herself next to me in polish course, and she was extremely nice and supportive while we were doing the exercises together. 
when i was walking in hallway with her, she subtly asked my about my number and i just gave her my phone with my contact open. (she closed the contact and scrolled the contact list saying it wasnt mine, which i found weird)
later on she followed me when i was leaving uni and , and i casually just dropped id like to grab some food. so she was super helpful to show me the streets (since im not often at uni) were we could eat streetfood and without any backthought i bought us waffles and payed for hers as well. 
she even accompanied me to the tram station.
i gave her a hug for goodbye and took my tram and didnt think anything. 

i realized she told mw stuff about herself, but didnt ask many deep questions about me (which i find odd?), so my gutfeeling told me shes all in for attention games.

i called her in evening to humourously ask her whats wrong with her since shes suspiciously nice to me, and wether shes a fed.
we both laughed, but i had a bad gutfeeling. 
she texted all week, she even double texted multiple times, because... well i really hate texting. i intentionally took hours to reply.

the day before next lesson she showed me she was making waffles via imessage. and i told her to bring me some tommorow.
next lesson. 
before next lesson i was about to grab a coffee and saw her smoking a cigarette with some guy from her lectures and didnt thunk much about it... until he and his friend just entered our small-class and sat there asking the teacher if it is okay.
shw again sat next to me, even gave me the waffles she made for me.
but i noticed she was heavily shaky and excited. 

i felt like shes probably one of those girls that try to get you hooked for attention, so i texted her how im not sure if'd work out for whatever random reason (i said im tryna seek god or whatever) and she should go sit with these new guys instead, (who obviously werent coming to the course)
she obviously paniced waiting for my response. and clarified that these guys are just from her lectures and came to troll the teacher, but wont ever come again etc. 
and from then on she heavily tried to qualify to me by how she low key is into that god stuff as well. So i said we could go pray together sometime.

From then on she didnt text me anymore the whole week up till the next lesson where she didnt even greeted me and sat back at her place totally ignoring me. 
i found that super inconsistent.
to make a cut, before the next lesson i just told her im gonna focus on lectures and realized i dont have space for women rn, so id delete her number respectfully, but how since shes super kind i'd wish her all the best for the future. 
her response thanking me for my honesty and then 10minutes later how im stupid for being the one that gave hope, despite knowing id focus on uni. the tone of that message was relatively flat, and it didnt seem like shed care about anything but making me look like i was the one chasing. kinda immature.


why do women do that half-invested stuff?
i felt heavily ambushed by a girl overinvesting into me and then inconsistently ghosting me in lectures. almost like lovebombing.
now i have a hard time focussing since im diabetic and the emotional stress knocked me out for a week.

To add Insult to injury, me and this woman are carrying the same exact bag in different colors. 

I get the waiter’s attention, thankfully a black woman, and tell her and I ask to move. The staff were very accommodating and even comped my meal. And the manager said “we do not play that here” as the woman got up to leave I called her out.

Lots of white stuff on the extraction hole too.,"On day 11 (after a tooth extraction of a lower molar), I tried using the syringe/irrigation tool to clean food out of my tooth socket. The food moved but it began to bleed mildly afterward. I was so afraid that it had caused dry socket!! It was my 2nd try at using the syringe and now I'm done with that thing. I'll keep gently rinsing with salt water 3-4 times a day. The bleeding stopped but during the next couple of nights, it bled a bit while I was in bed sleeping. Perhaps I was clenching down on it or something?

No pain (only mild tenderness). No swelling. No bad breath/taste.

I am guessing that I must have irritated the tender tissue. Is this okay/normal? Will this delay my healing? Will it be like starting my healing all over again?

Do you suppose that a piece of granulation tissue may have been washed away and caused the bleeding? Or is it the blood clot bleeding? Or just the skin on my gums/socket?

Also, is it normal to have white granulation tissue/white stuff covering the area at 16 days after getting a lower molar out? If it is food debris, it just won't come out with a gentle salt water rinse. Will it eventually work its way out? If so... how? 

There was only a little strip of white on Sunday morning until after I ate mashed banana and some yogurt. Then, I looked in the mirror and saw the socket filled with more white. I was guessing that banana must have packed in there but I would think that by now (Thursday) banana would have disintegrated and washed away...but it didn't. Whatever it is....it is there still. Could it be pus?  It is white. It is not painful. Not stinky. No swelling. I might not have been concerned it I didn't read that infection can be white!!!!

I really hope it is not infected!! I am hoping that it is just a common occurance of some kind...I just don't know.

LOTS of questions, I know...but I am worried. I almost made it to the 2-week mark without any issues whatsoever...and now this. Just when I thought that the dry socket risk might be over and I could get back to drinking coffee, eating tomato-based pasta sauces, eating chewy foods, using minty toothpaste, lifting things heavier than 5lbs, etc.) I was looking forward to reaching the 14th day and having the area fully healed.

I am concerned that maybe I won't heal up at all. Has anyone else had this? Did you eventually heal up? Did it take longer for your socket to fully heal? Am I just a slow healer, perhaps?

I am wrapping up my Fall Semester and first full semester of classes + internship. I'm at my site about 20 hours or so a week and classes about 9. Then I am working on Saturdays to make a few bucks in coffee. This experience I'm having started to really show itself about 3 weeks ago. Dating back to the summer, before my internship, I got some weird virus while on vacation that manifested as viral pink eye and a really bad cough. Rough couple weeks but I got over it. Fast forward to a few weeks ago - I noticed my eyes when I woke up were like a lite version of this same thing. Very red, kinda crusty, hard to see out of because my eye is filmy, and VERY tired with deep eye bags. No respiratory stuff but I don't know the last time I have felt this consistently fatigued despite getting 6-8 hours of sleep a night.

Over the last 3 weeks, I have had a number of people openly remark to me how tired I look, and typically out of genuine concern. It's embarrassing, because I am. I can't hide it. Some of this feels physical - I am having issues with my tinnitus (longtime musician), and by the end of my 4th or 5th session in a row on a given day, I often lose my voice despite not being a loud talker. I have gone from loving my internship to dreading it. But above all else, I don't know how to describe it except...I feel my body is failing on me. I think my stress levels are so pronounced that I feel and look genuinely unwell. I am not eating yet I am not losing weight, I feel constantly weak even though I'm lifting 3x a week. I feel emotionally numb and disconnected from my partner. 

I guess what I'm wondering is- do we think this is burnout? Is this just a unique manifestation of burnout? I just want to know where to start in healing from whatever this has been, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate. ",2,1732215275.0,therapists,1,1.0,False

Christina dumped a dizzying load of situation awareness into her mind as they swapped control of her own body. The ghost was happy to let go.

Tallah fumed.

For losing control. For being blindsided. Again. For being in this place, distracted from her mission, fighting a thing she shouldn’t have needed to. What business had she intervening in Erisa’s fate?

Revenge was honest motivation for anything. In the girl’s place, she would’ve been much more terrible, much more vile.

But now the path to her work was blocked by this creature and it didn’t seem like she had any intention of letting go if asked nicely.

“I’m here,” Tallah said. Vergil turned to her as they stopped on the shifting road of bones. “I’m fighting.”

“Bloody nice of you to take a break right now. Need me to fix you a cup of coffee or something, my Lady?” Sil asked in her most mocking tone as Vergil set her down.

“Droll.”

Something stung her face and they all reeled from the invisible touch. They’d wandered down the incline deep enough that they reached the black illum at its bottom. Dense enough to be nearly palpable in the air. It stung. Not as terrible as the labyrinth, but enough that it would kill them if they lingered.

Or worse.

She took a heartbeat to pull in power. It came to serve, almost gleeful at the prospect of violence but shaping it hurt. Her black mood matched its terrible history. Here, there were ghosts roaming the chasm. If they wandered far enough and stayed in the miasma of death, she was certain she’d see real manifestations of the architects and their final moments.

“Is she wounded?” she asked, more to Christina than the others.

“She’s pissed. You did something to her with the soul trap,” Sil answered as she dug in her rend and pulled out an aerum vial. “This is your last. I have exactly two more accelerants in here. Best we save them up.”

“I have one left in my rend.” She downed the aerum and pulled in more power.

*Her girls aren’t ranging far from the main body. Casting the trap may have disrupted her unique relation to the surrogate bodies.*

That made sense. The trap was active at all times. Without willing shields like Christina and Bianca, whatever way in which a soul expanded would be drawn inward rather than allowed to move out. Anna’s trick with her flesh doll had only managed to save a fragment of herself because it happened in the moment of expiration, when the trap’s draw was focused on the core.

Her knees trembled and there was a twinge of exhaustion in her eye. Every breath hurt in her chest, both from the corrupted illum and what were, definitely, at least three cracked ribs. Without her infusion, she’d be down on the ground, squirming in agony. Bianca wove power around her, like an invisible suit of armour, lending her strength. Uncomfortable, painful, perfect. Like a torture device she could wear to battle.

*That’s just unkind,* the ghost whispered. *I could let you crawl.*

No time to set up a proper strategy. The deeper they went into the gorge, the more dangerous she expected their stay to be. Above, the girl searched. Bones crunched underneath her great bulk, clattered, groaned. She could just make out the horrid thing on the edge of spritelight. It was only the thickness of illum that kept them hidden from Erisa, but that couldn’t last. She’d either stumble onto them, or their hiding place would kill them.

“Why’s the dwarf so quiet?” she asked, expecting Horvath chomping at the bit to get into the fight.

“It’s me,” Vergil said in his usual sheepish tone.

Tallah’s eyes snapped to Sil but the healer waved away her concern, “It’s his head thing. Blocked the dwarf. We’re making do with one Vergil.”

At least the boy didn’t seem much worse for her absence. A bit scuffed and bloodied, but otherwise looking hale and straight-backed.

“Lovely. Got fight in you?”

“Y-yes.”

“Good. We’re about to make a stand.”

He handed the mask back. “More use to you than me, now. Plan’s gone up in smoke.”

It was impossible not to see the walls forming around the edges. Barriers built higher than she expected Bianca to carry them, boxing them in, closing off the way out. A clatter of bones announced Erisa coming down from up high. Her outline in the illum did not match what she’d expected from what Christina had shown.

The girl had halved herself. She walked on disjointed limbs, holding upright by force of will alone. Nothing of that form suggested any reliable physicality, but she couldn’t doubt the girl was lethal.

This… this was precisely why soul magic had been banned. Meld two souls together and they’d each impose their morphological traits. It would never end well.

Erisa was the end result of falling off the razor’s edge Tallah and Catharina walked. There could scarcely be a worse fate.

“I am tired of chasing you, sister,” it said as it cautiously approached. A throat probably formed the words, but they arrived as a sort of mental assault, similar to the spiders, laden with growling distortion. “Why do you deny me? Why won’t you help me?” Shadows in the illum showed her daughters walking besides her, silent as ghosts.

Each word was accompanied by a flurry of barriers closing the perimeter. They cracked bones and raised a cloud of choking dust. Erisa was a storm of illum, incoherent now in her brutality. Wisps of silver jetted out of her, like steam, only to be drawn back in.

“What did you do to me, sorceress? Why? Haven’t I suffered enough?”

“You can’t undo what’s been done, girl,” Tallah answered. Her heart raced as she drew in more power. The girl would see it now, know she prepared to fight. “I am trying to help you.”

“You’re lying. I need only my sister. I need to be human. Not this. Not a monster.”

Her speech garbled, more and more of it turning to animal noise. Mutation continued even as they regarded one another across the expanse of bones, Sil’s sprite the only light. Erisa shied away for its touch, hid herself in the dark as if… no, that was an uncharitable thought. The girl had every right to her shame. Tallah couldn’t begrudge her that.

“You will be at peace if you let me help you,” she said. “You don’t need to suffer anymore.”

“Liar!”

A barrier cut the air. Then more, almost random in their vectors of attack.

“Liar! The goddess came to *help*, and she stole from me. The spiders came to help, and they destroyed me. I am tired of being *helped*. I am tired of being in pain. I am tired of being this!”

Tallah hopped back, drew Vergil after her as Erisa attacked. The girl didn’t move a muscle, but she didn’t need to. Every moment was another razor barrier.

*I don’t believe she has the stores of illum to keep this going,* Christina whispered.

*What does it matter if she does? Those barriers need a fraction of our own costs,* Anna put in. Both ghosts talked with a calm that kept Tallah balanced against her own frustration.

Rhine floated among the barriers, stepping between the edges to leer at her. Her form shivered as if seen through a heat haze. Someone else hid behind the wraith’s presence.

*Focus,* Bianca admonished.

She tried to. But seeing Catharina puppeteering her sister’s form ignited the fury she’d barely kept contained. It came and went in flashes, but there was no doubt.

Here was the bloody empress, torturing her with the visage of the sister she’d led to a horrifying end.

The first heat lance she fired burned the sleeve of her coat and blistered the skin beneath. It punched through the arrayed barriers but missed the girl, Tallah’s aimed drawn to the wraith.

*Focus!* Bianca insisted and forced her hand up at the right target.

Tallah loosed again and this time Erisa had to move out of the way. From a distance it was unlikely she’d allow herself be hit. Her girls streamed away, running silently, claws bared.

One reached the boy’s range and was cut down. Three more mobbed him, pushed him down, swiped and cut with glistening claws. Before she could trust herself to help, Sil intervened. She clobbered one of the waifs with a length of bone, shattering its skull.

The boy threw off the other two and stomped on the nearest. Blood spurted in the air.

“Vergil,” she growled, barely remembering the boy’s name through the haze of anger. “I want to—”

“Throw me!” the boy called to her, a manic grin in his voice as his axe’s smile chased away the third girl. Blood ran down his face from a bevy of scratches. “Try and not burn me. I’m flammable.”

His good cheer in the face of death cut through her distraction. She laughed as she lifted him with Bianca’s strength, and threw him bodily at Erisa’s shape. Little bastard had grown a spine of wrought iron.

Three lances fired in quick succession punched through Erisa’s defensive walls as Tallah danced on the edges of the girl’s razors. Vergil landed in the bones, rolled to his feet, and exploded up at their foe, aided by Tallah’s own fire pinning the girl.

At a distance, a battle between two channellers that could see the weave… it would be attrition. Having a fighter in the mix could tip that balance.

*I am ready,* Christina informed her. *Do not waste this. I can’t handle another.* Tallah’s back tightened in a familiar grip as the ghost arrayed her power.",1,1732215077.0,HFY,3,0.66,False

(note: this is my first time writing a horror story, so please be nice, but constructive criticism is welcomed. thanks, enjoy.)

It’s been a year since I had my wife, Lauren, admitted to Ozark Trail, a mental institute thirty minutes from our house.
it wasn’t something i wanted to do, but a dreadful decision that Lauren’s parents and I had to come to.

Her behavior started to change after our three year anniversary of being married. We’d just had our house built on my parent’s old property, our healthy daughter was four months old, and everything was going great.

It might have been a few weeks after we celebrated three years that I noticed she had stopped showering as often.

I don’t pay attention to when or how often my wife showers, so it was only when I noticed the greasy matting in her hair and the smell of body odor wafting off of her when she crawled into bed with me, that I realized she hadn’t been keeping up with her hygiene.

She told me she had just been too exhausted and couldn’t be bothered to shower.
My first instinct was to be disgusted by this. But then I immediately felt like a huge asshole when I took postpartum depression into account. So, I offered to help Lauren shower.

I brushed the tangles from her hair and I stood in the shower with her while she washed herself.
Then I brought her to bed, kissed her forehead, and we both went to sleep.

That wasn’t the first time I’d had to do that. From that point on, Lauren’s mental health and her overall ability to care for herself had taken a significant downward turn.

Her maternity leave had ended two months after our daughter’s birth. However, Lauren told me that she convinced them to give her an extra two weeks of paid leave, but when I noticed that our joint checking account was not staying at its usual amount, I began to grow suspicious.

When I called her work to ask about why she hadn’t received a paycheck in the last couple of weeks, they said that her maternity leave had already ended, and Lauren never showed back up to work. She never even contacted them.

When I confronted her, she cried and said she was sorry for lying. She told me she was afraid to go back to work. She didn’t want to leave our daughter alone.

“But she won’t be alone, she’ll be with a sitter,” I had said to try and console her. She looked up at me with her eyes red and swollen from crying. “I don’t want to leave her alone,” she had repeated and grasped onto me tighter. I just let her cry in my arms. I didn’t know what else to say.

I called Lauren’s mom the next day. I told her that Lauren had been incredibly depressed for a while, and I wanted to take her out for a day, just us together.

We were both exhausted from taking care of the baby, but it was clear that it had taken a much greater toll on Lauren than it did me.

Lauren’s parents agreed, happily, to watch Anna at our house. It was the first time they’d get to watch their only grandchild and it made me feel good that they were so willing to help us out.
However, when I told Lauren about this, she began to panic. She insisted that we could not leave Anna alone.

Again, I assured her that Anna wouldn’t be alone. She would be with her parents.
She began to cry, but I didn’t hold her this time. I took her by the shoulders and firmly, but calmly, I asked, “why can’t we leave Anna alone?”

She stared into my eyes for what felt like forever, a desperate, exhausted look in her eyes. I didn’t want to say anything else, because I had a feeling she was about to say something that would make everything fall into place, and I didn’t want to jeopardize that.

But what she said only made me more confused, and terrified.
She whispered it, like she didn’t want anyone to hear, even though we live on nearly a hundred acres of woods, with our closest neighbor being a mile down the road.

With tears still streaming down her face, in the quietest voice she could manage, she shuddered, “it wants to take us away.”

As much as I would have loved to throw my wife and baby in the car and drive as far away as I could, as quickly as I could, I didn’t. I stared back into those red, horrified eyes and I asked, “who wants to take us away, Lauren?”

She shook her head and blinked, more tears falling down her red cheeks.
“Not you,” she said, nearly sobbing by this point, “Anna and me.”

I believe in the paranormal. I’ve been a Christian my whole life and have always been consistent in my beliefs.

But I am a believer in logic too, and I did not believe that there was any non-corporeal being out there coming to take my wife and child.

So, when Lauren’s parents arrived the next morning, the three of us convinced her to let me take her out and let her parents watch Anna.

It was the first time in months she had been out of the house. First time in even longer that we’d gone out to do anything together.

When we had first gotten married, and our house was still in the construction process, we spent a lot of time in town, about fifteen minutes from our property. 

There’s a little diner that we both loved to eat at, and it became a special place for us.
We became regulars and the staff knew us by name. When Lauren was pregnant, the waitresses had given her gifts: onesies and sleepers and booties.

I was sure that going there again would lift her up, mentally.

Maybe she needed to be around other women.
It was a stupid hypothesis, but I was willing to try anything to help her get better.

The girls at the diner were excited to see Lauren. They showered her with hugs and that welcoming kind of love that women always seem to have for each other.

They asked about Anna, begging to see pictures of her, asking us when we were going to bring her to the diner.

All the while, Lauren was still detached. She’d given them hugs and answered their questions about the baby, but that was the extent of her friendliness.

She wanted to sit, so I told her to pick out a booth for us while I showed the girls dozens of pictures of Anna, from the day she was born up until that morning (I took a lot of pictures).

When the waitresses had dispersed and went back to work, one of them stayed behind. I knew her name was Carol, even without reading her name-tag.

Quietly, she asked, “is she alright?”

She nodded toward Lauren, and I looked in her direction. She was sitting in a booth, back facing me, just staring out the window and at the trees.

“I know it’s none of my business,” Carol added, “but she looks exhausted.”

I didn’t want to have this conversation while Lauren was sitting fifteen feet away, so I just smiled and said, “well, having a baby is hard.”

She gave me a knowing look, like she knew I was lying, but she nodded and walked away. I looked over at Lauren to see her still looking in the same direction and when I walked around to sit opposite her in the booth, she wore a blank expression.

“Lauren?” I said as I sat down.
She looked through me, expressionless.
“Honey?” I said, reaching out and touching her hand.

“Hm?” She said, looking at my face now. She looked sort of uncomfortable.
I rubbed her hand gently. “Anna is fine,” I reassured her.

She didn’t respond.

Carol came over to our booth, pen and notepad in hand.
“What can I get for y’all today?” She asked, flipping the notepad to a new page.

I looked at Lauren, “I think I’m in the mood for those pancakes we used to get all the time.” I squeezed her hand a little, and she smiled.

It made my heart soar to see her lips curl up into that beautiful grin that I hadn’t seen in weeks.

Carol wrote that down, “two orders of pancakes, and how about some coffee to go with that?” She asked, looking between us.

“That would be great, Carol. Thank you.” Lauren said. And though it was small, she smiled at Carol too.

I could’ve jumped with joy at that. She was actually smiling.
I was sure, in that moment, that my idea had really worked, and bringing her out really did help her.

After having breakfast, we spent the day going to various stores. Though Lauren was still mostly detached and spent a lot of the day in a daze, she was still able to pick out a few things for me to buy for her.

Afterward, I took her to the lake and we watched the sunset.
I decided to give her a gift that I’d been waiting to give her.

A week before our outing, after I had gotten off of work, I had gotten Lauren’s favorite necklace fixed at a jeweler’s shop not too far from home.
When the necklace, a silver chain with a ruby charm attached to it, had broken, Lauren was devastated. Her father had given her the necklace when she was sixteen and she’d worn it everyday since.

She’d been meaning to get it fixed, but never actually got around to it. So, I took it upon myself to do it for her.

We were sitting on a bench, her head leaning against my shoulder.
I pulled the necklace out of my pocket and showed it to her, wordlessly.
She looked at it, and then looked at me.
She took it from my hand before grabbing me and hugging me tightly.

I smiled as I held her warm body against mine until I felt her trembling. She was crying into my shirt, her hands gripping me as tiny sobs racked her body.

“Hey,” I cooed softly, “hey, it’s okay.” I held her tightly and let her finish crying.

I didn’t know why she sobbed like that, but she did. And she kept crying until the sun had gone down and we were ready to leave.
She let me clasp the chain around her neck before we got into the car and went home.

I thanked Lauren’s mom and dad for watching Anna and paid them $50 for spending the day with her. I know they would’ve done it for free, but it felt wrong to ask without giving them something in return.

They decided to spend the night with us, as it was late and neither of them were great drivers in the dark.

Alice, Lauren’s mother, helped Lauren get Anna to sleep while Lauren’s dad, Roger, and I made a late dinner for the four of us.
We decided on spaghetti, as it was quick and required basically no effort.

We all ate, went to sleep, and everything was fine for the rest of the night.

Lauren slept in, like she usually had been. So, I was the one that saw Alice and Roger out.

It was the weekend and I didn’t have to work, so I decided to make breakfast for Lauren and I.
I was grabbing the eggs out of the refrigerator when I heard a blood-curdling scream. First from my wife, and then Anna.

I dropped the entire carton, the eggs cracking and spilling out onto the tile.

The single flight of stairs felt like an eternity while I kept shouting my wife’s name with no answer.
When I got to Anna’s room, I saw her crib had been tipped over, and Anna laying on the floor, still screaming, while Lauren rocked herself in the corner, sobbing loudly.

I will admit that I hesitated at first. I know I shouldn’t have, but my first instinct was to rush to my wife and ask her what happened. But then reality crashed down on me when I was hit with another one of Anna’s heart-piercing cries.

I scooped my child up into my arms, searching her for any kind of injury and I began to coo her, to no avail.

She kept screaming in my ear as I rocked her.

Lauren finally looked up, tears and snot running down her face. She was crying like a toddler.

“What happened?” I shouted at her.
She began to sob again like she didn’t want to answer me.

I put Anna in her crib once I’d steadied it back to its original position.

I hated to raise my voice at Lauren, but I had to. I practically screamed at her, “what did you do?”

“Her face was gone!” She screamed back, choking on her sobs, “it was gone!”

Our child’s face was still fully intact, but her words still made my stomach drop.
My wife was losing her mind.

“What did you do?” I repeated, calmer, but still angry.

“I fell- I dropped her- I-“ she just kept crying.

She was holding her head, squeezing it like there was something inside it that she wanted to get out.

Anna was still screaming.
I took a deep breath, trying to be rational.
I realized then that Anna hadn’t eaten last night. Lauren never fed her before taking her to bed, and she hadn’t yet eaten this morning either.

“She’s hungry, Lauren.”
I picked Anna up out of her crib. “You have to feed her.”

I carried Anna to her mother, kneeling down so we were both on the floor.
Lauren hesitated, whimpering. Her mouth quivered and more tears beckoned at the waterlines of her eyes.

“Please, Lauren.”

She wiped her tears on her nightgown and reached out to take the baby.
I sat by her side, rubbing her arm while she let Anna eat from her breast.

We must have been a sight there on the floor.
Two exhausted people, both losing their sanity; one losing it a lot faster than the other.

I didn’t tell anyone about Lauren dropping the baby. I didn’t want anyone to think we were abusing our child or that Anna was in any kind of danger with us.
With me, at least.

I did, however, tell the professionals at Ozark trail that she had been having hallucinations along with extreme depression.

Once again, I didn’t hone in on the specifics for them, but I did say that I thought she was a danger to herself, but not to others.
She’s a sweet woman, she would never hurt anyone intentionally. Though, out of fear, I wasn’t sure.

I signed a bunch of paperwork, gave them my insurance information, and all that was left to do was to get Lauren to sign too.
That would be the hard part.

They advised me to tell her that it was more like a vacation than a mental hospital stay. They said that rehabilitation would be good for her. For all of us.

Her parents agreed.
At first, they offered to stay with her while I was at work. But out of fear that Lauren might accidentally hurt Anna again, especially in front of other people, I told them that wasn’t necessary.
However, I did take them up on their offer to watch Anna while I was at work. After all, I can’t bring a baby with me to a factory that makes car engines.

That night, after I put Anna to sleep and got into bed with Lauren, I told her about the meeting I’d had at Ozark trail.

I didn’t hesitate. I told her that I needed her to sign the papers, giving her consent to be taken in and held under the hospital’s supervision.

She didn’t say anything, she just laid there, her eyes open as she stared through me.
I didn’t let up, continuing to persuade her. I was practically begging her.

I even threatened to divorce her if she didn’t sign them, which wasn’t true and probably a shitty move on my part, but I would’ve done anything. It was our child’s safety that was on the line if she didn’t get help.

After nearly an hour of my begging and her looking at me with those big, terrified eyes, she agreed.

I took the papers out of my nightstand drawer and she sat up in bed, taking them from me along with a pen.

She hesitated, staring at the paperwork.
Finally, she said something. “Do you think I’m crazy?” Her voice trembled like she was on the verge of tears.

I didn’t know what to say. I couldn’t say yes, but I couldn’t say no either.

“I think you need help, Lauren.” I put a hand on her shoulder and she started to cry.

Her tears dripped onto the papers, creating little circles of wet in the printed words.

She stared down, “I don’t know if I’m losing my mind.” Her breath hitched before she continued, “but I see people. I hear them talking and they say I’m going to die.” She looked up at me. “Protect Anna,” her voice broke, “please.”

I nodded. I thought, the only thing I’m protecting her from is you, but I didn’t say it.
I told her I would protect Anna and that nothing was going to hurt any of us. She would get help, and everything would go back to normal.

Dropping Lauren off at Ozark trail was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. She cried the whole way there, cried while she held our baby, and cried as a nurse led her into the building and out of my sight.

I looked down at Anna, cooing in my arms.
As I strapped her into her car seat, I muttered affirmations to her, which might have been more to console myself than they were for Anna’s sake.
“She’ll get better,” I said as I clipped the tiny carseat straps over Anna’s chest. “She’ll be back in no time.”
Then we drove home.

After putting Anna to sleep, I laid on the floor and fell asleep next to her crib. It was the best sleep I’d had in months.

Things went relatively smooth for the next couple of months. I would take Anna to visit Lauren every weekend, Lauren’s parents watched Anna everyday, since they’re both retired.

I had spoken to Lauren’s doctor a few times since admitting her, and it didn’t seem like she was making significant progress. She was still depressed and was having the occasional meltdown. 

One meltdown was caused because she had apparently seen a woman standing outside her window. 

When the staff asked what the woman looked like, Lauren chose not to answer out of fear that they wouldn’t believe her.
Her doctor explained that it could take months for her to fully recover from her diagnosis, postpartum psychosis, and to redirect my energy to taking care of myself and Anna while Lauren rested.

That was easier said than done, but I managed.
Anna was six months old, and had just started teething.

I was letting her chew on my finger with what little teeth she had when my phone rang. It was the middle of the night, so I thought it might have been one of those telemarketers that I would usually ignore.

The number was from the hospital where my wife was.

I answered, sitting upright in my chair, Anna’s eyes flicking up to me in curious infant wonder.

“Hello?” I answered.

“Hi, this is Selena, from Ozark Trail Rehabilitation. I’m calling in regard to your wife, Lauren.”

Without hesitating, I asked, “what happened?”

She was silent for a few seconds. I wasn’t sure if she was hesitating or distracted. I could hear the typical hospital noises in the background: phones ringing, people talking.

Finally, she responded, “she managed to get out of the hospital tonight.”

I was standing by that point, pacing with my daughter on my hip. I was already looking for my keys while I spoke.

“Where is she?” I’m sure I sounded more frantic than I intended.

“She’s here, at the hospital. The police were able to track her. They found her walking on the road, just outside of your property. They figured she was trying to go home, so they followed her there.”

I exhaled, relieved.
“Is she okay?” I asked.

Her tone brightened, “she’s perfectly fine. No visible injuries, but she was covered in dirt and sticks like she was walking through the woods before they found her.”

I didn’t think to ask why she might have been in the woods. I was too relieved to hear that she wasn’t hurt.

When Anna was seven months old, Lauren was discharged from Ozark Trail.

To say she was better was an understatement. She had become an entirely new person.
I didn’t even notice that she had lost the color in her complexion until I saw that she’d gotten it back.

She wore the same clothes as when I had dropped her off, only they fit better after she was discharged. She’d regained the weight she had lost from when she went days without eating more than a few bites of anything.

When she wrapped her arms around me, I felt my heart soar. This wasn’t like any hug I’d had from her in the past three months. This was a hug that said, “I love you.”

I could almost feel gratitude in that hug.

We spent the day in bed and when I asked her about her stay in the hospital, she didn’t have much to say. I didn’t pry, because I didn’t want her to think too much about what we went through before she was admitted.

Everything was perfect. I had helped my wife and our lives could resume. I smiled to myself as I held her in my arms.

Life went on.

Our daughter started to talk around eleven months old and her first was “mama”.
I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t “daddy” or “dada”, but I was proud anyway.

Lauren had stopped breastfeeding after she came back from the hospital.
When she had attempted it again her first day back, she seemed uncomfortable, a little disgusted even.

She had handed Anna back to me and said she should probably eat something else from now on.

I found this a little strange, but I didn’t question it. It was her decision, ultimately, and if she didn’t want to do that anymore, it wasn’t my place to impose on that choice.

However, this wasn’t the only way she had seemed to distance herself from Anna.
She stopped responding to her when she cried.
She didn’t wake up when Anna would start waling at five in the morning, and even when we were awake, she would ignore Anna’s cries.

There was one night where Lauren and I had been up late together. She was straddling my lap and kissing me when Anna had suddenly began to cry.

“I’ll go get her,” I said, moving to get up.
I couldn’t though, because Lauren wasn’t getting off of me. She kept kissing me,
her lips trailing down my cheek and neck.

“Lauren.” I said louder, “Anna’s crying,” I had to push her off of me and she landed on her side on the bed.

She’d gotten angry at me for that.

She slept on her side, facing away from me for the entire night.

All of this, I chalked up to her still recovering from her postpartum psychosis.
Anything was better than having to go through all of that again, so I didn’t complain about her mood swings.

Maybe I was stupid for that.

A month passed, and Anna was already a year old.

We threw a party for her first birthday in our front yard. We didn’t have a lot of friends in the area, especially because of how rural our town is, but a few people showed. Some girls from the diner, Lauren’s mom and dad, and a friend of mine from work showed up. Daryl, my coworker, brought his German Shepherd, Sadie, to the party.

Anna absolutely adored Daryl’s dog. Sadie licked her face and it made Anna giggle harder than she ever had.

The waitresses that showed up took turns holding Anna and playing with her.

Lauren was inside for most of the party. She complained that she had a migraine.
It wasn’t a big deal though, because I did a good job of keeping our guests entertained.

Although, Anna was clearly the main attraction.

Once everyone had finally had a chance to hold my baby, she was given back to me. I held her while talking to Lauren’s dad.

“Mama, mama” Anna kept repeating.

I ignored this, as she repeated the word “mama” about a hundred thousand times a day, and I was more interested in talking about Roger’s ‘71 Pontiac GTO.

Anna began to point up at the house, saying “mama” again.

I glanced up to where she was pointing.
Lauren was standing at our bedroom window, staring down at me. I couldn’t read her expression, but when I waved, and had jokingly shaken Anna’s hand in a waving motion too, she didn’t wave back. She just kept staring.

Finally, toward the end of the party when everyone had begun to leave, Lauren came out of the house.

The only guests left were Daryl and his dog.
We were sitting in the grass, talking, while Anna played with Sadie.

Lauren’s shadow casting over Daryl’s face made me look up to see that she was standing behind me.

“Hey, honey.” I smiled at her, “you feel better?”
Her arms were folded and she was smiling down at me. 

“Yeah, I took a nap, so I’m feeling fine.”

When I turned back to look at Anna, Sadie was staring up at my wife, her lip curled up into a snarl.

I pulled Anna up into my arms as Sadie began to growl viciously, and then barked at my wife like she was some kind of animal.

“Hey!” Daryl yelled at his dog, pulling her leash to keep her from attacking Lauren, as it was evident that it was what she was about to do.

Lauren just laughed and went back inside.

I didn’t wonder why she wasn’t afraid, then. I was just happy that she wasn’t upset.

That same night, on my way to bed, I was about to walk past the guest bathroom upstairs, when I noticed the door was cracked. I walked quietly, so Lauren wouldn’t notice me, as I could hear her in there making faint sounds.

It sounded like she was laughing quietly.

My intention was to creep up on her and scare her. Something we used to do to each other all the time when our house had just been built.

I crept toward the door, and peered inside.
She was standing at the vanity, looking in the mirror.

She smiled wide at herself and then her face fell back to its normal position.

She smiled again, but this time, she waved.
I almost laughed because it was such a bizarre sight.

She smiled again, waving, and quietly she said to herself, “Hi, I’m Lauren.”

My face wrinkled into confusion. It was like she was rehearsing how to speak to people.

“I’m Lauren.” She said and smiled, waving again.

I stopped watching her. I just stood in the hallway, staring at our family photos hanging on the wall.
Our maternity pictures, Anna’s ultrasound photos, a picture of all of us the day Anna was born.
Everything was so much better, then.
Sometimes It felt like my wife never fully returned from Ozark Trail.

She was happier and not completely depressed, yes, but somehow not completely Lauren.

I wondered if that could be attributed to the medication she’d been prescribed.
Or maybe I was just remembering her wrong.

I went to go peak at her again to see if she was still practicing lines in the mirror, but when I turned to look, she was standing at the crack in the door, watching me.

I nearly jumped out of my skin, “Jesus, Lauren-“

“Were you watching me?” Her eyes narrowed. She looked angry.

“No, I-“ I began to stutter over my words. She was never intimidating to me before. “I was gonna scare you,” I admitted, sheepishly.

She slammed the bathroom door on me and locked it, leaving me in the hallway by myself.

It’s been a little over four months since that night, a year since I had Lauren admitted to Ozark Trail.

Since Lauren had been applying for jobs, we started to look at daycares to send Anna to while we both worked.

I was doing most of the work, as Lauren didn’t show much of an interest in anything having to do with Anna lately.

This had caused a few arguments between us, which usually ended in Lauren getting mad at me because I was “putting Anna before her”.
I’d never taken Lauren to be selfish, but she was really acting like it recently.

Tonight, we laid in bed together.

Lauren reached over and cupped my face and began kissing me.

She had been a lot more ‘excited’ in the recent months, which I couldn’t complain about.
I was half expecting her to be pregnant again by now, as she hadn’t been on the pill since before she was pregnant with Anna. But weirdly, she wasn’t.

I was kissing her neck and got to her collarbone when I noticed something that made me pull away.

“Where’s your necklace?” I asked, looking up at her.

“What necklace?” She responded, still lost in a daze of ecstasy.

“The ruby one. The one you wear all the time.”
I tried to remember the last time I’d seen her wearing it, but I couldn’t.

She was silent for a long time.
“It probably just fell off somewhere.”

I sat up, “do you want me to look for it?” I began moving the blanket to see if it could’ve been somewhere in our bed, but she stopped me.

“It’s just a stupid necklace. Don’t worry about it.”

I stared at her in shock. “But you love that necklace. You cried when it broke.”

She looked about as confused as I did before she just rolled her eyes and insisted that the necklace didn’t matter and went back to kissing me.

I woke up at around seven this morning to a voicemail from my neighbors on the other side of the woods, about a mile out.
An elderly couple in their late eighties.

I put the voicemail on speaker and set my phone down on the nightstand so I could listen to it.

“This is Joe.” The old man coughed, thick and loud, before continuing, “my wife’s been complaining, sayin’ she smells som’n dead off in the woods. It’s prob’ly a deer or som’n, but she said she can’t sit on the porch and drink ‘er coffee ‘cause it stinks too bad. I’d go out there and look, but I’m afraid I’d get my walker stuck and won’t be able to get back home. Anyway, thanks.”

The voicemail ended.
I groaned.
The last thing I wanted to do on a Sunday morning was get out into the cold November air and search for a dead deer.

I got out of bed and put on a pair of jeans and a thick, flannel shirt.

I was putting my shoes on by the front door when Lauren came up behind me.

“Where are you going?” She asked.

I turned to look at her as I pulled my coat on.
“The neighbors want me to go find some dead animal out in the woods, they said it’s making their whole yard smell bad so I’m gonna go do something about it.” I zipped up my coat.

“Let me go look,” she said, grabbing her coat.

I didn’t mean to, but I laughed. “Lauren, if it’s a deer, that thing is probably bigger than you are.”
She looked disappointed by my response, so I said, “I’m just gonna go drag it to the road so no one can smell it anymore. It won’t take that long.” I kissed her on the head.

“Just stay here with Anna,” I said as I walked out the door.

She held it open and stood in the doorway as I walked down the steps.

I could feel her watching me as I made my way toward the woods and when I reached the tree line, I looked back and saw her standing on the edge of the porch, the front door swung wide open as she kept her stare locked on me.
I shook this off and started into the woods, still unnerved.

I could smell death in the air, not long after beginning my trek through the sticks.
The sharp wind whipped through the trees and made it hard to hear anything besides the leaves crunching under me.

My cheeks and nose were stinging with cold and I regretted not wearing a mask.

I could feel my eyes beginning to water as the stench of rot overtook my senses.

Before I realized what had happened, I was on the ground.

I’d tripped on something, which I soon realized was a hole in the ground. A massive hole, about two feet deep and at least six feet wide.
When I sat up, I realized that the hole had been filled in with leaves, which were now all rotted into little brown corpses.

Not only that, but the smell of death was so close that I almost vomited.

I sat up on my knees in the hole. Something wet left reddish-brown spots on my jeans, which I thought was mud at first, until I remembered that it hadn’t rained here in at least a month.

That’s when I saw it. A red stone shining against the morning sunlight.

At first, my heart soared with joy because I realized I had found my wife’s missing necklace.
But when I went to pick it up by the chain, it resisted. It was attached to something.

I pushed enough leaves to the side to reveal something that made my stomach turn and I did vomit that time, off in the leaves next to the rotting corpse underneath me.

It was a human, but its face was gone and it had been scalped. Both of its eyeballs were there, staring up at me. What was left of its jaw, teeth still intact, was wide open and maggots had nested in it and were eating at the muscles of its skinless face.

Even through the decay, I recognized those eyes.
I threw up again when I realized the rotting corpse was my wife.

Confusion and terror and guilt flooded me like a river. I could’ve drowned in it. But I didn’t.
Because I was pulled back to reality when I heard the crunching of leaves behind me. I didn’t need to look to know who, or what, it was.",1,1732215072.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The first issue was the crust - the edges were so light and flaky, but the bottom was very compressed and tough.  It was so tough that you couldn’t eat the pie with a fork, you had to pick it up and bite. 
The second issue was that it absolutely did taste of coffee.  In the video she says the coffee powder should just add a bitter balance.  I even cut back on how much I added because I had a hunch that it would flavor the filling.  I ended up adding half a teaspoon and still felt it tasted too much of coffee.  

I was using a quarter sheet pan because I don’t have a baking slab.  I also par-baked my crust for almost twice as long as she does because the bottom was still glossy after removing the foil and pie weights, but I actually felt I could’ve park-baked it for longer.  Other than these differences, I followed the recipe exactly.  It still tasted good.  I definitely like the balance of sweetness, but it just wasn’t what I expected.  Also the tough crust has me stumped.

Has anyone else attempted this one?  Thoughts about where I went wrong or just the recipe as a whole? TIA!",4,1732214951.0,DessertPerson,0,1.0,False

Tips?,"I’m realizing a concerning pattern in my life. Every single time I have very small interactions with my codependent enabler mom, who I think is also a covert narc in addition to my dad, my energy just drains. It could be the most innocuous things like her letting me know she is leaving to do something or calling me about something so minute. It doesn’t matter what it is, I get so tired interacting with her that I want to take a nap. I could have coffee and feel like the energizer bunny and as soon as I interact with my mom my mood goes way down and I get very sleepy. This literally just happened.

This only happens when I interact with my enabler mom though. I think it’s because she is unpredictable and unreliable. One day she’ll understand why I dislike my narc dad then the next cuss me out dropping f bombs saying I need to respect my dad and act like nothing happened. This is the same man who she saw physically and mentally abuse me and cheated on her the entire marriage in front of her kids. She’s completely delusional. 

Dealing with her is like dealing with an actual vampire. I want to go complete no contact like I did my dad but it’s so hard because she is so needy and pushy. It’s way easier having my ndad outwardly just hate me and ignore me than dealing with my emotional needy enabler mother who feels like a clingy unstable toddler attached to me at all times.

I’m still searching for love, and honestly, it’s not easy. It’s like rediscovering a part of life I had unknowingly ignored. But I’m hopeful and open to the idea of finding someone to share this journey with.

Hey everyone, I'm a 25-year-old female, 123 pounds and 5'3"" high. I'm making this post because I need some advice from you.

Couple years ago, I used to drink Monster (1 can daily), then quit and started drinking coffee. One day, coffee didn't sit well, giving me shakes, sweats and extreme weakness (like low blood sugar feeling). After that, even one sip messed me up. Now, I can't have anything with caffeine.

This year around April, I took a 50mg caffeine pain reliever pill for menstrual pain (always took it without issues). But it triggered terrible anxiety at night, 139 blood pressure! My boyfriend said anxiety (because he was leaving town for 1 week), but I wasn't freaking out about none of that AT ALL; everything was fine until caffeine kicked in. I went to the ER; they gave me medicine through fluids for my blood pressure and my doctor said, ""STOP CAFFEINE COMPLETELY."" Now, no pain meds with caffeine.

Family history: mom (diabetic), grandma (hypertension), aunties (hypotension). 

Last night at my sister's, I felt SO SICK, CHRONIC FATIGUE AND WEAK out of nowhere! On the way home with my husband, we were talking normally, then I got the feeling of almost fainting, so I took sugar gum and felt better. Suspected low blood sugar, but history of no diabetes.

Nighttime: weird heartbeats (not palpitations or racing), hard breathing and finding sleep position weirdly so I can fall sleep without having the “crushing feeling”. Sleep's fine. (This doesn’t happen EVERY NIGHT COMPLETELY, but majority of them.

History: sinus tachycardia, tachycardia and left atrial enlargement (on every EKG). ER doctor scheduled cardiologist appointment, but it's far away.

Seeking advice! Has anyone experienced similar issues? Did you find an answer? Any guidance would help!

I'm not freaking out, I'm just confused because this is annoying and weird, and I dont know what to do since it's my first time experiencing ""heart-related"" issues. Which I literally don’t pay attention to serious things until is too late.

Also I forgot to mention that sometimes I get this punching needles in my left side that I need to hold in something because it hurts, and I get lightheaded along with it.

I have a healthy diet and I CANT GO TO THE GYM! If I use the stairs I feel extremely sofocated. All I do is walk a lot since I can’t run. Last time I tried the gym my whole vision went black and I have to see down in the gym machine because I literally knew I was about to pass out. Which I didn’t because my husband was there with me.

I don’t look into my health until is too late. And usually the one I look the most are the ones that are great, I’ve been avoiding checking my heart because I blame anxiety but honestly is getting annoying.

I'm the charming, witty, outgoing and laid-back type. Love big laughs and deep chats. I'm Irish but raised across Europe, so a bilingual French-speaker as well as speaking few other languages, and welcome diverse cultural and linguistic connections.

I'm an educated professional by day: well read and well travelled, athletic and driven, friendly and charming, sincere and attentive. Just as happy dressing down for a quiet night in, or dressing up for a big night out.

Hobby-wise: I love doing things with my hands (cooking, gardening, DIY), and enjoy working out (HIIT cycling, pilates, swimming, or just spending time in nature). I love discussing history and (geo)politics, and IRL socialising (optionally involving a coffee/drink in an outdoor terrace). Voracious reader, and since the pandemic Ive been tearing my way through reading material. I'm always happy to discuss and share recommendations on books, movies, series.

Right now, interested in great connection where it all flows effortlessly and we just 'get' each other. Friends first, but a spicy side is welcome. Be adorably obsessed with each other, and stimulate each other in mind, spirit, and body. I'm happy to chat, call, etc, and potentially to meet if there is genuine spark, chemistry and rapport.
 
If it sounds like we're looking for the same thing, let's connect and brighten up each other's day :)",1,1732214511.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

There are no clear restrictions against herbal teas. I have contacted my doctor a few times before this but they haven't gotten back to me and their offices aren't responding.

We talked for a good month before meeting again. She would text me nearly every morning and throughout the day (not one message after another, but every hour or so). 

I recently got out of a 3 year relationship so was just taking it slow to test the waters a bit, not quite committing to anything in my head. 

Then we met for dinner one night and really hit it off , didn’t go home together or anything that night though. 

The next week I invited her to my house, we chatted for hours then did the deed (for a solid 4 hours as wlw deeds go)

Then we started texting more and more, and I started to maybe get a (bit) more open to the idea and over my ex. 

I double texted her one night cause I was worried as she didn’t respond and I knew she was having some family issues, just wanted to make sure she was ok. 

After that she got a bit distant; then wanted to meet for coffee and say that she isn’t over her ex and isn’t looking for anything serious. This was a subject we never really talked about before (what we were looking for). 

I wasn’t over my ex either but I figured she was into it from all the talking and good sex, and I was willing to maybe explore the relation a bit further (without pushing too much)

I asked her if she wanted us to text less or just stop seeing each other and she said no, we get along well so we can enjoy that. 

I’m a newbie in the wlw world (my ex was my only girlfriend)- so, does this just mean she wants to slow down but could be open to an actual relationship in a couple months time? Or should I abandon this now before I get my feelings to far in (I actually kinda like her so not sure I can just do casual for more than a month)",1,1732214428.0,LesbianActually,4,1.0,False

I live in a low income senior apartment complex. It's a new construction, with about 60 residents. Ironically, Low Income Housing Tax Credit properties are the only kind of rent increases are not regulated, which means the are allowed to raise our rent as much as they want and as often as they want. Low income people are the ones that need rent controls the most!

We are all low income seniors living on fixed incomes. Some of us are barely able to pay for rent. 

The longest anyone has lived here is about 9 months. They are raising our rents by almost 30%! We are only partway through our lease. That makes this actually no longer 'low income'. My rent is going up $200, which means that more than half of my income is going towards rent. 

This increase means that many of us will have to start choosing what we want to give up in order to live here. Food? Medications? Doctor visits? Transportation? 

Some won't be able to stay here at all. It took me over a year, being on many wait-lists, to even get this place. Given that there aren't any other available places around here, let alone any wait-lists, many of us will probably end up homeless, or in shelters if we're lucky. 

Everything they're doing is probably all legal, but it's calculated, and it's heartless. They knew from the get go they they would be raising our rents.

They claim it was because they went solar which lowered our utility bills. But the solar panels were already here before they started leasing. 

In 2021, they got approval to subdivide our units into 43 condominiums. 

They only needed to lease out the pace initially to low income seniors in order to meet the requirements necessary be considered low income housing, and get the tax credits. Once they did, they didn't have to be low income housing anymore and could start charging higher rents. Perhaps they actually want us all out.

Also-  they promised on their website for our complex,  Senior Apartments at B20, in Chico, CA , that there are ""lovely tree shaded courtyard community spaces"". There is no courtyard, there are no trees. Also, they have a little community garden and a small enclosed area for dogs, but they won't put in any sort of seating. So we have a garden with flowers but can't sit and enjoy them. Or maybe sit and have coffee with someone. Or not have to sit on the ground to watch our dogs. We are all elderly seniors! 

Basically, ANYTHING that would make it easier for seniors they don't have here. It almost seems like our on-site manager seems to take a perverse pleasure in making things difficult for us, treating us like children, reprimanding us, etc.

There are many similar issues here, but not enough space to list them all...",13,1732214398.0,ChicoCA,7,0.94,False

It’s started when my friend K boyfriend broke up with her 6 months ago, since then K has become very reliant on me, messaging me everyday, calls for 2 hours + every few days and demanding that I see her one day each weekend for a minimum of 8 hours+ with midweek dinners. I gave her all the support I could give while living an hour away. Her treatment of me has gotten progressively worse, pressuring me to do activities with her, spend time with her, nothing was ever enough. I know breakups are hard but I feel suffocated, I have my own life, my own issues,eating disorder and mild depression (their interlinked) which I’m actively working to improve with professional help, I feel like I’m not her friend I’m her accessory or a pet of some kind. Recently it’s all came to a head, I knew mine and K friendship wasnt healthy so I tried to remove myself, I went off social media, didn’t answer calls and spoke to no one I wasn’t seeing in person (drastic but recommended by a mental health expert) lots of friends who I hadn’t spoken to in a hot minute reached out as k contacted them to ask about me, but expressed they felt uncomfortable as k messaged them multiple times a day to ask if they heard from me. I contacted k after a week and said everything was fine I was just busy, she gave me space for a week or so after that I thought we made some kind of positive progress. I was wrong. I had been working late and having a depressive episode, when k wanted to go to a film Friday, I said I couldn’t due to work. Saturday when I was in a depressive episode, k wanted to go out clubbing, I explained I want in the right head space and wanted to work though my depression with the techniques I’ve been learning, k wasn’t happy and kept pestering me saying we’ve both had a hard week we need to go out, I said no, she then said I won’t force you but I think you should, I affirm I won’t be going and stay home. Sunday I get multiple calls from k I call back at noon, k decided she was going to fix my depression! I said no… I’m not going anywhere today I’ve got a plan and agreed to do things with family later in the evening, k says nope your coming and starts guilting me saying how I’m not supporting her and need to see her I say no, k says she booked something and she paid lots of money and if I don’t go it’s a waste etc. this is the point where I’m stupid I know I’m stupid, I felt trapped, k kept guilting me, bullying me and railroading the whole conversation so I felt I had no choice but to meet her, I had to travel to her, cancel my plans, I was physically sick from the stress of dealing with k and my family(who are difficult) I felt like there was no way out, again stupid I know. By the time I get to k I was pissed, at her and my self at the whole situation, I lay out all the stress I had gone through because she made me feel I had no choice, I explained how I had to cancel plans with people because she demanded and guilted me into doing this with her. K laughed. K took me on a drive, got coffee, drove over every pot hole coz she liked how I cursed when the coffee spilled on me and took me to the zoo. Which she hadn’t booked, the whole reason I felt I had to go was because she said she booked something and guilted me, I asked her why she lied and she said well you wouldn’t have come here otherwise. I told her I was fucked off with her behaviour, she’d gone too far, lying and manipulating me wasn’t right or kind and not something you do to a friend. She said I was being unfair to her and I wasn’t being a good friend by not enjoying her company and if I had a problem I should go call my therapist.

","Coming up on almost one month since D-Day, the literal worst f\*\*\*ing day of my life so far. Long story not so short, WH was having a 6+ month EA + PA with a coworker. I feel so devastated because I had specifically asked him earlier this year, clear and direct, to distance himself from her because she was reaching out too him way too much and I had a feeling she had a crush or found him attractive, something. He told me he would but ultimately did not so feels like a double betrayal. He says he doesn't fully know why he didn't just stay away, that he made a half ass attempt and she continued to come around and he thought it wouldn't be an issue but of course the more time they spent together, talked, etc. he started to have ""feelings for her."" This year has been rough for our marriage, we have been fighting non stop and it started last year but it really took off this January where it just felt like clock work we were getting into fights every other week to every week.

We both felt frustrated, and both made comments about things simply not working, but now I feel robbed of these last 10 months knowing this was going on behind my back and had to have only made our fighting worse? He was now getting swept up into these feelings for her and like the attention, being heard, being validated all the meanwhile I am still fighting for my needs and to be heard and validated in the marriage. He said he thinks early in the year is when he started to feel like he was developing feelings for her but it wasn't until maybe May or start of June he decided to tell her. She definitely played into this and saw it as more of a game as she tried to ""end"" things with him and bought him relationship books and other bs I assume to not come off as the truly horrible person she is willingly and happily engaging in an affair...she was asking him about his penis right away...so yeah doubt she wanted it to stop.

The whole EA last several months, for the first couple of months they never met up outside of work. It was all texting and spending time together at work, they would go for a walk or get coffee, but he swears it was never physical from May/June until mid-September, they had hung out only twice outside of work during this time and it was never physical. We kept fighting, kept getting more distant (again how much of this was him pushing me away?). He says they didn't have cute names for each or talked about missing each other during the EA part it was more getting to really know each other, sometimes they would make comments about looking nice today, he'd compliment her hair, she'd comment on how tall he was, things like that but it wasn't overly romantic or sexual. My WH has said at the time he felt so distant from me, he was holding onto things I had said in the past about the relationship, and all our fights about it not working out and that he really liked the attention he was getting from her and how she listened and validated all feelings/perspective on the marriage and he just wanted more and didn't want it to stop despite still having small moments of guilt. He kept leaning more and more into her.

During this time, we did have some good days where things felt better like this is the us we both remember but overall it has been quite tense these last 10 months of fighting. I don't believe that gives anyone a right to cheat and again how much worse did things get because now he is distant and pursuing someone else. I did feel a significant shift from him June...I didn't think it was an affair, I thought all the fighting was weighing on him as it was one me.

In mid-September we had a big fight and stayed in different rooms and kept all talking to a minimum via text...this lasted 10 days. This is when the affair became physical as she began sending him sexually suggestive videos via Instagram. The first day they slept together is the day this no contact stint actually ended oddly enough and we said a few words to each other (end of September). Things felt tense, but we slowly started to talk again by the next weekend we were still in a weird place but I had this overpowering moment where I broke down in crazy tears, begging and pleading that he never cheat on me and promise me he never has (we already had some trust issues because of some girls he was looking at online). He looked at me, said I was scaring him and promised me. This was after they had sex and then heartbreakingly enough he went and slept with her again after this moment. When I asked him about it now that the A is out and the open he said he did feel really guilty but seeing me like that his only thought was ""I can never tell her about this now.""

I wish so badly he would have confessed in that moment, before he went to do it again. I was traveling the next week for work and we were on okay terms, we facedtime at night to say goodnight and after we hung up he went to her place and they had sex twice that night. It is so painful to think he said goodnight to me knowing he was going over there. How didn't think stop him? He confessed to the affair on 10/25 because of an STD scare. He had no plans to stop or tell me, he said he hadn't thought about how it would end that maybe it would fizzle out and that we were on our way to divorce anyways. I just think that is total BS. He trickle truthed me for 2 weeks after confessing, felt like blow after blow. I finally erupted on him and told him one more lie and I will spend the rest of my days making sure he is miserable. That finally woke him up.

Now it's almost 1 month from DDay and he has been a total wreck, I mean a true mess of a person crying, angry at himself, confused, hurt, he seems to be spiraling as hard as I am. Part of me resents him for it, like now you're hurting? You weren't hurting when you were in the affair, you weren't remorseful or worried about my pain when you did all this. This seems to be genuinely eating him up inside...he has shared many other things with me about his childhood, his experiences with women, his desire for attention from women and need for validation that he never shared before. I sometimes feel like I can piece together how this happened or how he allowed it to happen, but I also strongly believe there is no reason to cheat on a person, especially your wife? How can I EVER trust this man again? He kept this thing going for 6+ months, he wasn't planning to ever tell me, there were moments and signs we both see now that should have made him stop and he didn't.

I feel so confused every day, I truly love him so f\*\*\*ing much. He keeps telling me he will fight for me, he will never love another, he is FINALLY \*eye roll\* going to do the real work to heal, growth, be the man I have always wanted but is this real?

He has not been a horrible partner, yes we've had issues but overall I felt he was a good man and partner but these past two years have not been great and things kept getting worse and worse. I know see he has a lot of issues with taking accountability, lack of emotional maturity, flawed perceptions of sex and relationships that I never really knew, along other issues he needs to work on, things he needs to unlearn. It feels like he has SOOOO MUCH work to do before he becomes the man I want, need and deserve and on top of that I would still need to be able to trust him again, to forgive this horrible thing, to find a way for it not to control me.

It all seems so impossible, I think to myself why do I even love this man? Look at what he did to me, look at how much he has failed me. Will he really change, is it even possible? The thought of never seeing him again, his family, etc. it is so overwhelming, it is paralyzing, I start to have intense panic/anxiety attacks about it. I cry on and off all day, I am angry, I am anxious, I have crazy grief. I just feel so overwhelmed and think how does this ever get better? How?

I wanted to rant, but also ask for insights, advice, support. Do any of you have similar stories? Do you have tips for how to cope, I am consumed by this ALL DAY. I have never been so unproductive in my life...I have barely done a thing at work for 3 weeks, but I can't bring myself to do anything. There are days I don't even shower, I barely move, I call and text him all day. We spend hours and hours talking because I want answers, I want to talk to him, I sometimes only feel calm when we are talking. I simply do not know what to DO! I feel so hopeless and desperate.

So later on I would go to his apartment for coffee and drinks. Than we were kind of seeing eachother it wasn't anything serious. I ended up basically ending it with him because I didn't see myself being in a serious relationship with him anymore. The seeing part only lasted a week or so not long. He got very upset and would say he's going to get a 60 pounder and get drunk than he would constantly knock on my door like the cops till I ended up calling the cops on him for him to leave me alone.  3 months down the road again we started talking just as friends. Well he told me he's on Facebook dating now looking for men. Long story short he's planning on meeting these guys for one night stands. I found out he doesn't use condoms and doesn't care if he catches HIV or anything else. I feel sick to my stomach that I even ended up seeing this guy and what could've happened to me if we had sex.

But would be grateful for your thoughts! Context: baby no.1 due June 2025, I don’t drive and currently live in a smallish terraced house with a v small box room for the baby and no green space within walking distance. We have a spiral staircase which I’m worried will be a death trap for a baby. There is also only one nice coffee shop 20 mins walk away, and the area is quite rough and in a bit of a no man’s land between lots of things.

If I use public transport, I can get to a range of parks, loads of baby activities and places with more restaurants etc within 30 mins. This however feels a really long time with a baby especially on maternity leave where I’ll feel knackered and probably just want to go for a quick walk somewhere green and a coffee somewhere nice and close? 

If I drive all of these things are more like 10-15 mins away. 

On the other hand I could get a bigger mortgage and move further out to Bromley-ish area. Which is more suburban and not necessarily my vibe and I worry I won’t get on with the mums so much. But I could get a bigger house with more space and better proximity to coffee shops etc this way. I would have to reduce my pension contributions to release mt salary but I’m currently paying a very high percentage as I was interesting in retiring early. This seems maybe like less of a priority now, maybe I should sacrifice happiness and convenience in the moment? I’ve always lived in shitty places and part of me thinks when baby comes it would be nice to be somewhere that feels safe and green. 

It is a much bigger financial commitment tho and I could probs fix the issues with this house for an extra £20k which I could borrow from the bank on top of my mortgage. 

I also feel this is now or never as I don’t want to make mum friends and then have to move away. But maybe it’s ok to make mum friends in Bromley anyway by going to baby groups there as it’s 30 min on the bus? For some reason the idea of having to get on the bus is making me feel anxious but maybe I’m overthinking this?!

Grab your coffee, this is going to be a long one!\* ☕

# Why This Guide Exists 🌟

Picture this: It's 2009, and I'm standing in my garage, looking at what was supposed to be a beautiful oak coffee table, but instead resembles something that survived a sandstorm. That was my wake-up call – having the right sander isn't just about buying a tool, it's about investing in the quality of every single project you'll ever make.

# Understanding Bench Circular Sanders: The Deep Dive 📚

# What Makes Them Special

A bench circular sander is essentially the unsung hero of the woodworking world. Unlike their handheld cousins, these workhorses mount directly to your bench, providing stability that's crucial for precise work. Think of it as the difference between drawing while holding your paper vs. having it firmly secured to a desk.

# Types and Their Superpowers 💪

**1. Disc Sanders:**

* Perfect for straight edges
* Excellent for small surface areas
* Ideal for end grain work
* Great for angle adjustments

**2. Orbital Sanders:**

* Swirl-free finishing
* Better for large flat surfaces
* More forgiving on delicate woods
* Superior for final finishing

# The Science Behind the Specs 🔬

Let's break down what really matters when choosing your sander:

|Feature|Entry Level|Mid-Range|Professional|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Motor Power|1/3 HP|1/2 HP|3/4+ HP|
|Speed Range|2000-6000 OPM|4000-10000 OPM|2000-12000 OPM|
|Dust Port|1.5""|2""|2.5""+|
|Weight|15-20 lbs|20-30 lbs|30-40 lbs|
|Price Range|$100-200|$200-400|$400+|

# The Holy Trinity: My Top 3 Recommendations 🏆

# 1. WEN 6502T Disc Sander: The People's Champion

**Price Range**: $$ **My Experience**: This has been my daily driver for three years now. Here's a real story – last summer, I was restoring my grandfather's Victorian-era writing desk. The veneer was tricky, with lots of delicate edges. The WEN's consistent power and smooth operation helped me preserve every detail while removing decades of wear.

*Pros:*

* 4.3 amp motor that just won't quit
* Belt changes that don't require an engineering degree
* Cast iron base that's stable as a mountain
* Price point that won't make your wallet cry

*Cons:*

* Dust collection could be better
* Table angle adjustment can be finicky

# 2. Makita BO5041 Random Orbital Sander: The Refined Beast

**Price Range**: $$$ **Workshop Tales**: This sander changed my finishing game completely. Last month, I had a commission for a walnut dining table. The client wanted a glass-smooth finish, and this sander delivered. The variable speed control is like having a fine-tuning knob for perfection.

*Pros:*

* Ergonomic design that prevents fatigue
* Speed control that's actually useful
* Dust collection that works
* Built like a tank

*Cons:*

* Premium price point
* Replacement parts can be expensive

# 3. Metabo HPT SV1813DAQ4: The New Kid on the Block

**Price Range**: $$$$ **Real Talk**: When I first got this, I was skeptical about the price. Then I used it on a batch of 20 cutting boards for a holiday craft fair. The brushless motor and advanced dust collection system made it possible to work for hours without cleanup breaks.

*Pros:*

* Brushless motor technology
* Best-in-class dust collection
* Digital speed control
* Minimal vibration

*Cons:*

* Expensive initial investment
* Learning curve on the digital controls

2. **The Multi-Grit Mistake** Tried to skip grits on a maple table. The scratches were visible under finish. Lesson: Never skip grits!
3. **The Dust Collection Disaster** Ignored a full dust bag once. My garage looked like a snow globe, and my wife wasn't pleased. Lesson: Empty that bag!

# Pro Tips from Years of Experience 🎯

# General Sanding Wisdom:

1. *Start with the coarsest grit needed, not wanted*
2. **Keep your sanding discs clean**
3. *Let the tool's weight do the work*
4. **Change paper before it's completely worn**
5. *Maintain consistent pressure*

# Maintenance Schedule:

* **Daily**: Clean dust collection system
* **Weekly**: Check belt tension
* **Monthly**: Lubricate moving parts
* **Yearly**: Deep clean and inspection

# Specialized Applications 🔧

# For Different Woods:

* **Hardwoods**: Start with lower speeds
* **Softwoods**: Higher speeds but lighter pressure
* **Exotic Woods**: Test on scraps first
* **End Grain**: Use dedicated sanding sequence

# Project-Specific Recommendations 📋

|Project Type|Recommended Sander|Special Considerations|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Furniture|Orbital|Variable speed essential|
|Small Crafts|Disc|Precision control needed|
|Restoration|Both|Multiple grits required|
|Production Work|Industrial Grade|Durability priority|

# The Economics of Sanding 💰

# Cost Analysis Over Time:

* **Cheap Sander**: $50-100 (replaces every 1-2 years)
* **Mid-Range**: $200-400 (lasts 5+ years)
* **Professional**: $400+ (10+ years with maintenance)

# Community Favorites (Based on Local Woodworking Group) 👥

*Surveyed 50 members of my local woodworking guild:*

* 40% prefer WEN for value
* 35% choose Makita for reliability
* 25% opt for premium brands

# Final Thoughts 💭

After 15 years, thousands of projects, and more sawdust than I care to admit, I can say this: investing in a quality bench circular sander is like investing in peace of mind. It's the difference between dreading the finishing process and looking forward to it.

But

He doesn't eat enough!!! At all. For example, today he worked from home for the morning and had a coffee with a dash of milk. That's it. 10 minutes before he left for the office (11:50), he realised he hadn't eaten so quickly air fried some meatballs to take on the drive with some clean tomato sauce and mozarella... max 600 calories.

For dinner he will likely have steak, chicken or gammon with eggs.

So, 1500 max?

He has ADHD so a lot of the time he forgets to eat or grows tired of certain foods/finds food boring. 

How do I help?? 

He never eats breakfast and barely eats lunch (only if he remembers to make it the night before) but might have a few snacks and always has dinner as its made at home.

I've heard people who want to build muscle just force themselves to eat A LOT for a period of time?

-	Love exploring mid-size cities. Places such as Loei, Nan, Udon Thani, etc
-	Speak conversational Thai 


Requirements:
-	No Pattaya or Hua Hin (heard HH’s air quality is same as CM)
-	Don’t want to be in the center of touristy areas such as Patong, Bangla, etc. Nightlife is also unecessary.
-	Good air from February - May. Rain or heat doesn’t bother me  
-	Easily accessible scenic motorbike routes ON-road (twisties, mountains, viewpoints) as i have a touring big bike and do daytrips at least 1x/week. 


Nice to haves:
-	Good coffee shop culture similar to CM
-	Decent beaches nearby


Budget:
-	Up to 15k THB for a studio or 1BD that’s somewhat modern. Is this realistic for short term monthly rentals?
-	Ideally a serviced apartment or condo",1,1732213654.0,chiangmai,0,1.0,False

Please help. ,"So, I've been seeing this man in 3 months now, he first contacted me on FB messenger wanted to take me out for dinner. I looked him up on the internet like I always do when meeting someone new just to know they hasen't done too bad crimes or that they're married. I could see he is married and I asked him about this, said I can see that you are married so no thanks. But he convinved me that he is seperated from his wife in real life, just not on paper yet but they gonna get a divorce soon in like a couple of months. And I asked him why they are seperated, he said because they dont get along anymore, fight all the time and fight about how to raise their 5 kids. The oldest is 19 and The youngest is 5. Something about a tatto for his oldest son they dont agree about and other things as well. I asked how long you've been seperated and he said -""for 2 years, I've been single for 2 years."" I asked why didnt you get a divorce before since its been so long time. He said because he's afraid The authorotise, The social departement will do extra controls if they divorce and that they afraid they gonna take The children to fostercare. Wich dosent happen a lot if not The parents are abusive towards The children so I dont know why they would worry so much about that. He said they are agreeing on making The divorce and that his wife dosen't love him anymore and vice versa. Since the beginning I've felt something is off but Im apperently way too curious to not stick around to see whats gonna happen bc really like this man and I dont often find someone i like this much where The chemistry just fits so well. 

He tells me what they gonna do with The children in the future how to share the costody and seems to have answers to everything, like they really have been talking about it. He lives with his mom he says. His wife are living in the same building as his mom, just different appartments (I looked it up its true) so even if I check where his care is at night, after he leaves me it dosent matter. (He has never slept here at my place but comes late at night after his work and then go home bc he says need to take his oldest son to school in the mornings bc his oldest son also staying at his moms place.) Though he is written on the same adress as his wife and their kids.

He also picks me up almost everyday to go to the gym and work out together before his job. He says he loves me and his heart only for me, he gives me lot of attention and always ask if I need anything, just let him know, Im not alone etc. I've almost left him 2 Times already bc found out things about his wife. First time it was mostly a bad feeling that he's still together with his wife (I dont want to do her wrong either) but he then called his mom up on videochat and presented me to her as his new girlfriend and she says I am so welcome there soon to meet up with her and his son. (Her son knows my language but not The mom). He also introduced me to some of his friends as the girl he is seeing. I dont know if this matters but they are arabs and muslims and maybe just maybe the family could have an acceptance for their son having multiply woman i really dont know for sure. So after this it felt better and I was on 60/40 instead of 50/50 like before this. But then the other day I found his wife on tiktok with open account and she has put up a lot of tiktoks of him and her cooking together, celebrate his birthday with the kids together, she made him cake and lot of cookies and had a present for him wich looked like a parfyme. There also videos of them eating ice cream, drinking Coffee and going to restaurant without the kids. He dont have anything of her on his social media though. 

I understand that they must have some sort of relationship because of the kids they share together but then I see her latest tiktok that was pictures of their weddingday and rings and how long they been married (20 years) since 2004. Also a voice in the background that said ""i love you more and more for every year, this only gets better and better for each day, I need you so much"" etc etc. And all of her relatives including her own Sister is writing congratulations and wish that they will be together until the end of time and that they grow old togehter and Wishing them a happy life and marriage and all of that ""May god keep you together"" bla bla bla. I made a hard job managing to translate it all on different apps to really get it all right bc tiktoks own translation is not always that correct. But I get the picture. 

So I wrote him ""we dont have anything else to talk about, fix your divorce first of all until then its over between us. And maybe I should say congratulations on your weddingday, 20 years, wow good job! Now I block you, goodbye"". But then I got curiuos at his answer so I didnt block him and he answered ""I dont care what my wife says or writes. She is doing this in front of the children so they dont absorbe negative energy and she dont want any of her relatives to know she has seperated. So she post false stuff. I dont know what u mean but I didnt lie or fool anyone. But as you wish, see you when im done with everything, take care of yourself."" 

I just aswered ""this sounds really strange to me"". Wich it does. But why would he introduce me to his mom and why he wanna go gym everyday and give me all this attention from morning til night and takes me to restaurant now and then. Also met his oldest kid and he told me he told his kid ""this is ""my name"" and I Like her"" and his son said ok dad. But I really dont know bc i dont speak arabic exept for a few words here and there. But this would mean his oldest son and The family on his side know about the separation but just not on her side? He then continues sending me hearts and stuff but dont call me to talk but I didnt call either bc I wanna have this conversation eye to eye so he can't hang up on me. And tomorrow we gonna see each other and go to the gym and I have lot of questions bc feel really confused. 

Im gonna ask him why they didnt tell her family yet when its been 2 years of separation (not 2 months) and ""are you never gonna tell them""? Then ask ""so your family and your oldest son knows but not hers""? I mean you said you werent lying to anyone but you are both lying to her family in that case and for your children. Im not gonna tell you what to do with your children but why she didn't tell her family after so long and pretends to still be in the marriage with you? Why she lying and u allow it in that case? 

Or is this bullshit from him and they are actually together still for real? And its not false posts at all? One in a million that this will turn out good for me but I really want to see it all through totally before I decide to leave for good. What do you think is he playing me for a fool and he thinks im stupid or could it be true what he says? And even if its true what he says, do i really wanna live like that and hide so not any of her friends or relatives see us hug or kiss for example. I will not be able to do theese things with him outside where we live bc he afraid she or her close ones will see? Whats also making me confused is the fact Ive talked to his mom. Im really bothered bc i see myself as quite smart and mature girl (im 34 and hes 42 and his wife is 45.) But when it comes to relationships I have never been Lucky. And soon my chances of getting pregnant and having a kid will disappear so I really dont want to waste my time here if there is no chance is gonna work out bc he still with his baby moma. Maybe he never actually even left her from the beginning and everthing he told me was lies. I dont know my head explode please help me. I got into a mess. Who is this complicated? What can I ask him tomorrow to really go to the bottom with this all he also told me I cant see anyone else bc then he cant se me no more.

Hobby-wise: I love doing things with my hands (cooking, gardening, DIY), and enjoy working out (HIIT cycling, pilates, swimming, or just spending time in nature). I love discussing history and (geo)politics, and IRL socialising (optionally involving a coffee/drink in an outdoor terrace). Voracious reader, and since the pandemic Ive been tearing my way through reading material. I'm always happy to discuss and share recommendations on books, movies, series.

Right now, interested in great connection where it all flows effortlessly and we just 'get' each other. Friends first, but a spicy side is welcome.

1gwmacf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gwmacf/tw_he_never_loved_me/,TW: He Never Loved Me ,"This is just going to be a big fat rant about a toxic relationship. Major TW!!!! You’ve been warned. 

I made a post about how my bf said I wasn’t his “intellectual equal” and that I should’ve aborted my son and the fact I didn’t proves I’m stupid. I was looking for advice and the advice I found was “break up with him!” Well, I didn’t like that advice so I stayed. 

I struggle with disordered eating. He knows this. He oinked at me one time and I told him not to do that again. Well, he did it again about a week later while I was on the verge of tears trying to eat a piece of cake and got mad at me when I started crying. He also made a habit of pinching fat on my body, especially when we were intimate. He never stopped despite how much I pleaded with him. 

I got extremely drunk one Friday night and blacked out. I couldn’t move or speak and was kind of sprawled halfway onto the couch. He proceeded to record himself pulling up my skirt and touching himself over my unconscious body. He then showed his friend and they made fun of me. He got mad at me when I got upset about this. 

I was drinking every night with him because I couldn’t stomach his voice or touch. I had to be drunk to tolerate it. Despite this, I still loved him. My self esteem was so low, and I stupidly thought that if he could do and say all of these awful things and still be in a relationship with me, they couldn’t be true. 

The straw that broke the camels back was when we were swinging (I did it to make him like me more, but passed it off as I just needed to be with women so he wouldn’t think he had that much control over me), I told him while I was sober not to touch the girl we were bringing home. He agreed. Fast forward an hour or so, drinks are flowing and we go to the bedroom. She puts her hand on him and I completely disassociate. I say “do you want to fuck her?” He says “what are you comfortable with?” I was crushed. He knew I had issues setting boundaries with people and I wanted him to set the boundary for me. I just said “do whatever yall want” so as not to make the girl embarrassed or uncomfortable. The next day I brought it up to him and he said it was my fault. I can accept that I needed to set stronger boundaries, but I really think we were both at fault here. I texted him later and said “idk that we are going to work out, but I don’t want to make any rash decisions so let’s give it a week.” He responded with “I want us to work, but if you can’t see me the same I understand.” And then started hanging out with his friend and fully broke up with me. Over text. After a year and a half together. I was crushed. 

We agreed to stay fwb, but he found out I hooked up with someone and called off our coffee hangout where we were supposed to talk through everything. I cried to him and asked why I was only a body to him. He then said he could do the next day. He texts me that he doesn’t want to. I told him I’m done sitting on his backburner and I had to pick up my meds that day. I told him to lmk when he was out of the house so I could get the rest of my stuff. We had a huge fight. He threw a bag at my head, so I shoved him and said “if you want to hit me, be a man and use your hands.” I grabbed my shampoo and slammed a shampoo bottle on the floor and he got in my face and started screaming at me. Like, bloody murder. He puffed out his chest and said “hit me! Hit me!” I didn’t hit him. He told me that I deserved the rape and abuse from my baby daddy and I snapped. I wished death upon his family, made fun of his body, made fun of his high pitched voice, and told him I should have believed his dad when he tried telling me he was a narcissist (his dad is a literal psychologist btw). I am not proud of it and I’m struggling with a lot of guilt over the way I handled myself. He started shoving me and dragging me around. I grabbed some of my meds and he said, “I don’t think you understand how worthless and pathetic you are. You aren’t even worth the energy it would take to put my hands on you.” He then tried to kiss me and I pushed him away and he called me pathetic. 

We talked after things cooled down and I apologized. I asked if he really thought I deserved to be raped and abused and he said, “no comment.” Despite this, I cried on his shoulder and begged him not to go. We put the stuff in my car and I drove home and felt…nothing. Not anger or sadness. Just nothing. 

I went back to his house to get my mail. He let me use his bathroom. He was high, but happy and hanging out with his friend. His friend who saw the video he took without my consent. I emailed him and said I needed my chefs presses (they were like $100), and then he threatened to file a restraining order against me , but he said he would mail them to me. It’s been a week and I still haven’t gotten them. (For context, we had been communicating through email. He would talk about how he missed me and then randomly go off on me and say he was going to block me. I know it sounds weird, but I swear I wasn’t being mean or anything of the sort. I don’t know why he would just randomly snap.)

I had the realization that he never loved me. It hurts. I met someone new though and I posted us getting drinks at a bar. (I blocked all of my mutual friends except two and he blocked me.) I saw someone sent the post and, would you look at that, he unblocked me. I blocked him and went private. 

I don’t love him, but I want an apology. I want him to acknowledge how he hurt me. I know that will never happen, but I just don’t want to believe someone would be with me for a year and a half just for sex. That is all I’ve ever been used for. I want to feel worthy and capable of being loved. I want to be able to communicate about my pain without someone yelling at me and blaming me for starting an argument. I want someone to love me without me changing the way I dress, my sense of humor, and my face for them. I just want to feel loved for once. I didn’t get it growing up. Not from my family. Not from relationships. I want to experience the kind of love that inspires art. I just feel so defeated. Anyways, thanks for reading my rant.

1gwm9iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1gwm9iy/our_loneliness_is_killing_us_and_its_only_getting/,Our loneliness is killing us and it's only getting worse,"Let’s talk about loneliness.

Not the kind of loneliness where you feel a little off for a day. I’m talking about the kind that creeps into your life slowly. The kind where you realize you’re seeing your friends less, spending less time with loved ones, and swapping real connection for likes, notifications, and incredibly imbalanced parasocial relationships. 

According to United States Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, it’s a [full-blown epidemic.](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html)

The [physical health consequences](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf) of poor or insufficient connection include a 29% increased risk of heart disease, a 32% increased risk of stroke, and a 50% increased risk of developing dementia for older adults. Additionally, lacking social connection increases risk of premature death by more than 60%.  
  
And the data from Jonathan Haidt’s, [*The Anxious Generation* ](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036)(incredible book) backs it up.   
  
Back in 1980s, nearly half of high school seniors were meeting up with their friends every day. These numbers held fairly constant throughout the next 20 years.  
  
But something dramatic happened towards the end of the 2000s. 

2010 marked the moment when smartphones truly took hold. The App Store was in full swing, and social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter were starting to explode. Suddenly, it became easier (and more addictive) to connect online than to make plans in person.

https://preview.redd.it/6wastiklqa2e1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=f440b632f8c2c59c7d7c77f8c6acfc8d27eea861

By 2020? That number dropped to just 28% for females and 31% for males. And it’s not just teens—across all age groups, the time people spend with friends has been tanking. We’re hanging out less, forming fewer close connections, and it’s starting to show.

And it’s not just teens—across all age groups, the time people spend with friends has been *tanking* since 2010. 

While social media usage is skyrocketing…

We’re hanging out less, forming fewer close connections, and it’s starting to show.

Meanwhile, in [*Blue Zones*](https://www.bluezones.com/)—places like Okinawa, Japan, and Sardinia, Italy—community is everything. These are the places where people live the longest and healthiest lives, and one of their key “secrets” isn’t diet or exercise. 

It’s human connection.

**People in these regions spend real, meaningful time with friends, family, and neighbors. And those relationships aren’t just nice to have—they’re literally saving their lives.**

Let’s contrast that with what’s happening here.

Social media promised us connection, but what it really gave us is a substitute. Instead of sitting across from a friend, we’re staring at a screen. We scroll through highlight reels instead of living our own. And while it feels like connection in the moment, it’s hollow.  
  
And I don’t mean to fear-monger, but I can’t see a world in where this doesn’t get worse.

Not only are we spending less time with real people, but we’re starting to replace human relationships altogether.

Platforms like [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) are exploding in popularity, with users spending an average of[ 2 hours per day](https://qz.com/a-startup-founded-by-former-google-employees-claims-tha-1850919360) talking to virtual characters.   
  
[SocialAI](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247253/social-ai-app-replace-humans-with-bots) (which is *such* an ironic name because it’s the most dystopian, anti-social thing I’ve ever seen), allows you to create an entire Twitter-esque social feed where every person you interact with is a bot, there to agree with, argue against, support, love, and troll your every remark. 

Think about that: instead of grabbing coffee with a friend or calling a loved one, people are pouring hours into conversations with bots.

These AI bots are designed to ‘simulate connection’, offering companionship that feels “real” without any of the work. They don’t challenge you, they don’t misunderstand you, and they’re always available. 

And that’s the problem. Real relationships take effort. They require vulnerability, compromise, and navigating conflict. 

But when your ""relationship"" is powered by an algorithm, it’s tailored to give you exactly what you want—no mess, no misunderstandings, and no growth.

If the platform decides to update its system or tweak how the chatbot responds, that “relationship” changes overnight. Imagine building your emotional world around something that could vanish with a software update.

Unfortunately, it’s already had devastating consequences. Earlier this year, there was a heartbreaking story of a young man who reportedly took his own life after his interactions with [Character.Ai](http://Character.Ai), who he had become deeply attached to (both emotionally and romantically), spiraled. 

Truly fucked up.

So, what’s the fix?

**It’s simpler than you think: prioritize connection. Call a friend. Meet up in person. Join a group, have dinner, or just go for a walk together. If you’re a parent, let your kids play without micromanaging every interaction. The small stuff—laughing over a meal, sharing a story, or just being present—adds up in ways that matter more than you realize**.

And when you do, pay attention to how it feels.   
  
I promise — no amount of likes, comments, shares or AI chatbot connection will be able to truly replicate that.

I spend my life living their dream, meeting their expectations and in return get called a spoiled brat.

We live in a poorly designed house from the 1890s. Rooms are enormous, but I never had a personal room, not even my own bedroom. My desk is in the living room with the TV. There is no quiet space to isolate myself. Quarantining during COVID resulted me sleeping on the floor.

I sleep 5-6 hours a day and during peak busy seasons, work more than 8 hours a day. Add in one hour commute to and from, it’s exhausting. I’m a light sleeper, and may have insomnia (it takes me 30 minutes to fall asleep and I can’t fall back asleep once awaken). I told them, but they suggested to wake up early like everyone else. Ironically, these hard working early risers take mid day naps after lunch and dinner. Naps gives me headaches; I never had a nap for the last six months and don’t drink coffee.

This morning, my mother turned on the light and opened the door to let light pour into the dark room. She claims she didn’t wake me up. 

No one at home listens. I think I may find solace in never interacting with any of them again in my life. Their best phrase is, “what do you want me to do?”

Is it too much to ask to use some common sense? Sleep and bright lights don’t go together. I would like to see how I am spoiled - half of my toys and clothes were hand me downs. I wasn’t permitted to watch cartoons in the summer in the living room because we couldn’t afford more than one AC. The AC was installed in the bedroom and we invited guests to the bedroom. Our furniture comes from other relatives.

B/G of note:
- 27F, healthy BMI, ADHD on methylphenidate under psychiatrist, 18mg+36mg XR spread out in the morning, and 10mg IR in the evening, works well for me and stable on this dose for 3 years. No other regular meds, sporadic PRN paracetamol/ibuprofen/lemsip. No significant FHx of heart disease/DM etc. Grandmother had lymphoma late in life. 

Current symptoms:

- randomly short of breath intermittently, couple of times a week, typically not after exertion, lasting <2 minutes

- Garmin feedback of sustained drop in HRV (cannot seem to get out of the 50s for weeks even when feeling well), despite good quality and sufficient length sleep regularly and minimising alcohol intake (normally 1-2 days a week, couple of pints), daily long walks as part of commute, and eating well. Also regularly getting Garmin sats of 88-93% whenever I ask it to measure it. I know to take these things with a pinch of salt so I am being careful to monitor trends rather than individual measurements.

- heart palpitations randomly and often weekly (of note I rarely drink coffee, mostly tea)

- feeling generally tired and like I don't have the energy for anything 

- Hb low when I last tried to give blood a few months back, so I couldn't donate (sad times). Only donated twice before.

- increasingly getting colds/flus, 7 times in the last year, last had one a couple of weeks ago and still not feeling back to normal. Normally I was getting 1-2 per year.

- regular headaches starting over the last year or so.


I did go to the Dr about the cold/flu frequency but didn't think to mention about the random SOB and HRV and low sats stuff... Probably should have but it was a very quick appointment and I'm just not that great on the spot. They've agreed to do some bloods which I'll get done in a week or so, but now it's been a few days since my Dr appointment and I've been increasingly thinking about the other stuff and wondering if I should mention it and request another appointment. At first glance, I'd love your opinion on differentials. I'm probably overreacting and hope it's something straightforward like anaemia, but I can't shake the feeling something else is up. I like my job, don't work long hours, take regular holidays etc so I don't think it's burnout. Idk. Help!

Background context, I'm just a solo returner player thinking about finding an FC to join. Now I could just sign up for any free company that is recruiting, or even shout somewhere for an active guild, but whether I end up in one that meets my needs would be mostly up to luck. 

I have been in many FCs since I started playing in 2019, but I've noticed there's so many factors that go into guild satisfaction that it's hard to just recommend, ""join a big free company and you'll easily find peeps to play with"". Personally I'm more comfortable with small FCs and their tight-knit, homey communities, but not a lot of members sometimes means there's no one available or interested in doing a dungeon with you that evening. Players can be at vastly different job levels or not reached that MSQ trial you're doing, or maybe they're a busy adult who is only on for an hour per day, etc. 

Anyway, that is all to say there are so many reasons why people join free companies, what they look for and why they stay. **So if you could please share for a moment,** how big is the FC you're in? Why do you stay and are you happy with the guild? 

**If you're interested in sharing a lot,** what was the reason you joined your current FC? Were you invited randomly, or did you actively seek them out? Did you just join because you already had friends there? Do you just think of free companies as places to chat or as resources to find people to play with and get to know, versus pugging with randos?

How long have you been in your FC? Are you part of a social group in the guild, or do you mostly keep to yourself? Do people chat majority in game or do they generally take it outside to Discord/other social platforms? 

Is your free company highly organized, or not at all? Do you enjoy scheduled events, or do you prefer just trying to rally interested peeps when you want to do something like treasure maps/EX trials? Does your FC slow down when there is a content lull, or does leadership try and keep things alive between patches? Do you even care, or just play other games too at that time?

Finally, do your FC mates understand your love of exclusively Lalas, Bunbuns, frogs, piggies, [insert other loveable animal], dragons, coffee, other popular guild themes or are they just faking it?!

It was as if the light didn’t even want to touch me or maybe I just wasn’t willing to let it in. The brightness felt almost mocking, like it was too cheerful for how I was feeling.

I woke up at 8, as usual. The routine felt grounding, though a little dull. I brewed my coffee, the kind I always drank—strong and black, just how I liked it. There was something soothing about it, like it was the one thing I could still control. It didn’t take away the ache in my chest, but for a moment, it helped me forget.

 I looked in the mirror, mumbling the same thing I said each morning. ""You can do this. Just get through today."" It had become mor than just a habit; it was a lifeline. Without it, I wasn’t even sure if I would make it through the day.



Work had been smooth. Too smooth, actually. My manager—who typically kept us locked in the office until midnight, piling on more and more work like we were some kind of machines—surprised me by telling me to leave early. I must’ve heard wrong. This had to be some kind of mistake. She was the type who expected perfection, and suddenly she's telling me to leave early?

I should’ve felt relieved—who wouldn’t be, after endless hours at the grind? But I couldn’t shake this weird feeling in my gut. My boss never let anyone leave early. Ever. He was the kind of man who thrived on control, keeping us late, pushing us harder, never giving us an inch. And yet, today, he just waved me off, like it was nothing. No explanation, no reason.

 It didn’t feel like kindness. It felt... deliberate. I kept replaying the moment in my head, trying to make sense of it. There was something about the way he spoke—too smooth, like he’d already decided this before I even walked in. 

And his smile? It wasn’t warm. It was thin, calculating, like he knew something I didn’t. Was he being generous for once, or was there something else going on? 

The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I felt. Maybe he wanted me out of the way. Maybe something was about to happen, and he didn’t want me there to see it. 

It wasn’t just an early dismissal—it felt like I was being removed, and the thought made my chest tighten. Was I imagining things, or was he setting me up for something? Either way, it didn’t feel right. Not at all.

Still, I wasn’t going to argue. I grabbed my bag, still trying to wrap my mind around it and walked out. A strange mix of excitement and confusion buzzed through me. Was this a sign that things were turning around? Or was it just the calm before the storm?

On my way home, I stopped by the supermarket, still trying to make sense of what had just happened. My boss’s face kept creeping into my thoughts.

 He’d always been demanding, sometimes cold, treating us like we were disposable, pushing us harder with each passing day. But today… today he let me go early. Why? Why had he been so… pleasant? Almost too pleasant.

 I couldn’t stop thinking about his comment earlier: ""You’ve been working too hard, don’t push yourself today."" How did he know I’d been working late? He didn’t even have to say it—I already knew he kept track of everything, from every move I made to every little mistake I made. 

It was like he was watching me, always. And that thought sent a chill down my spine. It felt like he knew more than he should.

At the register, the cashier gave me a long, confused look. It wasn’t the usual friendly smile. This time, his gaze was more like a double-take—like he was trying to figure out if he knew me but just couldn’t place me.

'Back again?' he asked, his voice uncertain. 

I froze for a second. 'No, I just got here,' I said, my voice coming out higher than usual. I forced a laugh, but it felt wrong, like it didn’t belong to me. My hands were shaking now and I had no idea why. Why was he looking at me like that? He glanced at the register screen, then back at me, frowning deeper. 'You already bought these—same items—just a few minutes ago.""

The air in my chest tightened, and my stomach dropped. I stared at the screen. There I was. The person in the footage looked just like me—same eyes, same ears, but different clothes. A part of me wanted to laugh. It had to be a mistake. How could it be possible? But the fear was already creeping in. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat louder than the last, and I could feel the cold sweat forming on my back.

I paid quickly, fingers trembling, and tried to focus on getting out of there. The world felt like it was closing in on me. I couldn’t wrap my head around what had just happened. How could someone look exactly like me? Was this some kind of twisted joke? Or was I being targeted, watched… manipulated? My boss's strange behavior today suddenly felt connected, like I was being drawn into something, like I didn’t even have control over my own life anymore.



The walk home felt like a bad dream, like I was moving through fog, trapped in a nightmare I couldn’t shake off. Every step felt heavier, like something was following me, even though I couldn’t see it. My mind wouldn’t stop racing and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t calm down.

That night, I barely slept. My mind replayed the scene over and over, until it felt more like a strange story than something that had actually happened to me. I tried to brush it off, tell myself it was just some bizarre coincidence but the fear wouldn't leave me. It only grew, digging its claws deeper into me.



The next day, my body perfomed all the motions as if on autopilot. Work ended early again, but I barely noticed. I kept telling myself it was nothing, just another strange coincidence. However, that nagging feeling lingered. It clung to me like a shadow that refused to leave. 

When I finally got to my mom’s apartment, I tried to put on a smile. The door opened, and there she was, smiling at me like everything was normal. But then, she said something that sent a cold chill straight to my bones. 

“Did you miss me, or do you just not want to go home?”

It wasn’t just what she said, but the way she said it. The tone was off—too casual, too knowing, like she was in on something I wasn’t. My whole body went stiff. I froze, unable to speak. My heart felt like it had dropped to my stomach, and suddenly, I could feel the color draining from my face. I didn’t know what to do with myself. Everything felt wrong, like I was trapped in a moment I couldn’t escape from.

She noticed right away. “Are you okay?” she asked, her voice soft but filled with concern. “You don’t look so good.”

I opened my mouth to say something, but no words came. I just nodded, trying to force a smile. “I’m fine,” I lied. It felt like my tongue was stuck. The words tasted wrong, like they didn’t belong to me.

She didn’t seem convinced, but she didn’t push. Instead, she laughed softly and shook her head. “Come on in.” I excused myself to the bathroom, needing a moment to breathe. The moment I was alone, I leaned against the sink, staring at my reflection in the mirror. The person staring back at me didn’t seem real. I was there, but I wasn’t. I could barely hold myself together.



When I finally came out, I tried to act normal. But the air felt thick, like I was suffocating. Dinner passed in slow motion. My every movement felt stiff, like I was on autopilot. I couldn’t swallow without feeling like I was choking. The sound of my own heartbeat was deafening in my ears, but I couldn’t bring myself to look up from my plate.

My mom paused, looking at me with that worried frown. “Are you sure you’re okay?” she asked.

I wanted to say yes. I wanted to say that I was just tired or that I was fine, but the words wouldn’t come. I could feel the lie building in my throat. “I’m fine,” I managed, forcing another smile. But it felt like I was lying to both of us. 

The rest of dinner passed in a blur. I didn’t taste the food. I barely heard the conversation. My mind was somewhere else, somewhere dark. I couldn’t stop thinking about the doppelgänger- the person who seemed to know everything about me, who looked like me, who might be living my life.



When I left her apartment, my mind was still spinning. The unease followed me, like a shadow that refused to leave. It was impossible to ignore. I didn’t want to go back to my apartment. I didn’t want to be alone with these thoughts. But I had no choice.

Back home, I Googled it—whatever this was. I couldn’t stop myself. And I found stories from others who'd experienced something similar. The idea that someone could look exactly like you—live your life, take your place—it terrified me.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the person I saw in the footage. Was it all a coincidence? Or was I being targeted? My mind raced with questions I couldn’t answer.


Just the thought that wouldn’t leave me: what if she took over my life?

1gwm40x,https://www.reddit.com/r/theevilwithin/comments/1gwm40x/tew_2_is_not_a_true_sequel_to_the_original_game/,TEW 2 is not a true sequel to the original game,"I wouldn't want to be too bad with the game, it has its good things, the effort is visible, but the result is bad, very bad indeed.  Father theodor, myra, etc. Sequel totally far from the tone of the original.  
  
The general reception of the first game can be summarized more or less like this: This coffee is good, but perhaps too bitter.

By bitter, we mean: some of its camera problems, its level design, and so on.

In the sequel, instead of taking the good and refining it, and taking the bad and turning it into something better, the sequel directly dilutes everything. They end up serving you a glass of hot water, no more coffee.  
  
The lore of The evil wihin has a lot of potential. It's a Silent Hill-like nightmare, using Cyberpunk methods. I think anyone can see how fascinating it could be. 

For a true sequel, include the ideas of the collective unconscious in Jung's work. The archetypes of fear, the memory shared by all organisms since the beginning of existence.   
  
To the real sequel sprinkle it with some of the conspiratorial rhetoric of MK Ultra, a new dissociative drug on the market that is extremely addictive, and that accumulates its effects to a point of no return, where your consciousness is lost forever in an unknown space.

A town lost in the middle of nowhere whose inhabitants start to disappear and no one knows why.  Send Sebastian there to find out what's going on. A bit of detective work until things start to reveal their horror.  
  
With some Concept-God awakened in the deep and primal layers of human consciousness. Reality being this body of ideas and sensations.  
A style that would point to something, let's call it, Neo Lovecraftian.  
  
Even if it takes some time, I think a new game is quite possible. If the new game better understands its potential, the franchise could be reborn incredibly well.",0,1732212977.0,theevilwithin,6,0.42,False

And honestly? The collective sigh of relief could probably power a small city.

In a statement that oozed self-pity and gaslighting, Gaetz announced he was stepping aside because his confirmation was “unfairly becoming a distraction.” He also made sure to sprinkle in some nonsense about how “excellent meetings” with senators somehow weren’t enough to make this work. Sure, Matt. Because what really tanked this was the *meetings* and not, you know, the whole sex trafficking thing.

**From the House Ethics Committee investigating him for sexual misconduct to the Justice Department poking around allegations of sex trafficking (which ended with no charges, but seriously, read the room), Gaetz’s baggage was the size of a Boeing 747.** The fact that he even thought he could waltz into a Senate confirmation hearing and come out unscathed is peak delusion. And let’s not pretend this was about “momentum” or “distractions,” as Gaetz so dramatically put it. The guy had all the momentum of a drunk uncle tripping and hitting head on the coffee table.

Honestly, though, it was always going to end like this. The second that screaming pile of orange garbage put Gaetz’s name out there, we knew it was just a matter of time before the walls started closing in.

So, let’s talk about what’s next. Because if you think the soon to be Sh\*t Stain in Chief is done trying to stack his cabinet with unqualified loyalists and outright cronies, I’ve got beach front property in Arizona to sell you. The Gaetz debacle is just Round One. The current bench of cabinet hopefuls still looks like the cast of *Sharknado* if it were rebooted as a political thriller.

**Let me just say it plainly: we bullied congress relentlessly over releasing the Gaetz report, and it scared Gaetz off. When we show up, when we call out, when we refuse to let these absurdities fly under the radar, it makes a difference. Every email, every phone call, every snarky tweet—it all adds up.**

**So, let’s stay unrelenting. Keep calling Congress. Keep tweeting. Keep showing up. Let’s make every single one of these nominations a public spectacle, because the last thing this administration wants is for their rogues’ gallery to face actual scrutiny.** If we can stop Gaetz, we can stop the rest of this dumpster fire, one cabinet pick at a time.

Game on. Let’s keep the pressure on and the mockery going.",41,1732212869.0,msnbc,15,0.97,False

I have been vegetarian from birth . I have been heavy consumer of dairy until 2022.
July 2022 I had severe migraine issues on daily basis. I visited doctor who prescribed medication and suggested to find triggers for migraine. List she suggested was caffeine, lack of sleep, stress and dairy. I was sleeping well. Not heavy consumer of caffeine. So I decided to try reducing dairy intake. Initially just reducing curd, cheese for 2 weeks I started feeling light and migraine reducing, better sleep. Overall I felt less lethargic. I decided to stop dairy completely. Initially I had usual concern about protein intake so I started researching. Came across multiple documentaries on wfpb benefits, how animal protein is harmful. Gave up dairy in 2 months completely except tea and coffee with milk which I had hard time giving up . Slowly reducing number of times in a day I could reduce it to just once a day. By nov 2022 I was able to consume black coffee and black tea. Those documentaries motivated me to go wfpb that is no processed food like avoiding any packet foods, sugar. Within 3 months by Feb 2023 I lost 10 kgs, no health issues. I was eating good quantity of food twice a day without counting calories all this while. Fast forward in 2 years I lost another 4 kgs, healthy loss of weight. In these two years I didn't change anything in physical activity. I used to get frequent cough and cold before 2022 irrespective of weather, once in at least 2 to 3 months. After going wfpb I got cold and cough only thrice in 2 years which was viral infection, recovered in no time. Overall less medication, no major disease. I initially worried about overall nutrients I am getting through food, so I did blood work evry 2 months. To my surprise everything improved, iron improved, haemoglobin improved, cholesterol dropped initially but I noticed whenever I took D3 supplement it spiked. Now I don't prefer D3 supplement and try getting as much sunlight as possible. Now I only take B12 supplement. 

What kept me motivated? Improved energy levels is first. I kept watching videos frequently like vegan linked YouTube channel which keeps publishing interview of success story. Game changers documentary, forks vs knives documentary and whatever comes in my feed. 
Once I decided to go vegan, I announced to friends and family. It is not easy saying no to good especially in social gatherings. Don't keep exceptions, cheat day concept didn't work for me as it leaves memory of taste and you crave to have it again. 

If you are thinking to go vegan go for it, figure out what works for you by slowly changing diet. Don't do drastic change at once. After some time it is like if I have processed food I don't have proper sleep and feels heavy next day. So it becomes habit.",16,1732212809.0,PlantBasedDiet,1,0.95,False
