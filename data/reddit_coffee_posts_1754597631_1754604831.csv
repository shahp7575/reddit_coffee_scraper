Hi there, I make 140k today at a startup at a Senior IC level -  I have been here for 4 years and as of recent have felt less happy and motivated at work, and burnt out from the fully remote position, leadership doubts and change exhaustion. We had large layoffs a few months ago as well which definitely caused morale to go down. 

I received an offer from what has historically been a dream company of mine, highly established large tech company with a great office in nyc. That said, the offer will be 20k lower in base salary (but offers equity) at a junior IC level, and this is the very top of their band that I already negotiated to. They have way more benefits (free coffee, breakfast & lunch, hybrid schedule, 401k match, bonus, wellness stipend, etc).

The lower base and level downgrade stings, but I think looking at the offer more holistically and the room for growth makes it more appealing. Additionally, I love my current manager and would say that would be the toughest thing to leave along with some great colleagues.

I feel so torn - do I take this new offer?? ",1,1754604639.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1mkdmoy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mkdmoy,"HELP! Did I buy a sofa that's too big for my living room?! Also, any decorating ideas? I know about CRAP but I still have no idea what I want to do, lol. (The sofa is navy blue and the pillows came with it.) Yes, I know my coffee table is off center (and too small). I moved it after taking the pics.","This is my very first apartment and my very first sofa. I figured a three seater would be ideal so I can have both of my grandparents over, but now I'm kinda having second thoughts. It isn't quite as bad as I thought it was at first (the sofa was just delivered today and I didn't realize that it wasn't pushed all the way back against the wall), but there isn't a whole lot of space between the corner of the sofa and the front door. I mean, it's a little over five feet, but when I get a rug, the door is totally gonna hit it if I open it all the way. This coffee table is too small for this couch, but if I get a bigger one, the front door will hit it. It's cutting it really close already. (I liked the shape of this room at first, but now...) AND I totally screwed up by buying a coffee table before I got a sofa (I wasn't expecting to wait almost two months after moving in to buy a sofa, and I went ahead and ordered the coffee table along with a bunch of other stuff I needed from Ikea), so it's really way too light colored, isn't it? :( What do I do? Do I need to try to exchange the couch for the smaller version and just sit in the folding lounge chair I was using before if I have two people over or is it fine? Is the coffee table okay? (The coffee table will have a shelf, btw. I just don't have the tools to finish assembling it. Turns out I need an awl. Who has an awl???) Any ideas for how to decorate? I know the cables around the TV are hideous. I need to get shorter ones (and also a better power strip; it has six outlets but only four things can actually be plugged into it, so I can't plug in my Nintendo Switch and I haven't set up a way to actually watch anything other than Blu-Rays and DVDs yet because I am absolutely NOT connecting my Blu-Ray player to the internet or getting a smart TV because that stuff is a privacy nightmare and I have an old laptop that I'll use as a streaming device instead). I intend to eventually put a six cube organizer under the air conditioner, though I'm a little concerned it could get ruined. Water started dripping from the air conditioner when there was a super heavy rainstorm (like, so heavy that my dad lost power) a few weeks ago and actually damaged the wall and the maintenance guy said there wasn't really anything he could do other than try putting an old basement window well cover that he happened to have in his truck over it and hope that kept the water out. (It's hideous, but at least now I don't constantly hear my upstairs neighbor's AC dripping on mine.) The blue box fan by the couch stays. I have an extension cord running from the outlet behind the couch and that's the most practical place to plug it in (rooms didn't have to have as many outlets when this place was built) and I need it to bring cool air into my bedroom at night so I can sleep, since the living room is the only room with AC. I don't know what I did with my dad's measuring tape that I keep forgetting to return (that little black one on my coffee table is only 10 feet), but my iPhone's measuring thing says the room is around 10.5x11.75? But with a corner cut out of it, of course. I really have no idea what I want this place to look like. I don't even know my favorite color. I never really decorated my room at my dad's house much because it was always such a mess (lack of storage) and I was always hoping I wouldn't be there that much longer anyway and also it had ugly brown carpet and yellow walls.

Painting is not an option. The walls are plaster, so I couldn't use nails even if the lease DIDN'T specifically forbid them. Command strips are fine but I may have some trouble because of the texture of the walls. Which places are smoothest will determine where I hang things.

I'm 28, btw. And poor. I'm about to start college, and my job is paying for it because I work for Amazon, but I'm gonna have to go down to 30 hours a week. (I'll still be able to make ends meet. Fortunately this place is only $750/month with all utilities included, literally the cheapest place I could find. Don't worry, the neighbors say the landlord is great.)",1,1754604480.0,femalelivingspace,0,1.0,False

1mkdmaw,https://i.redd.it/rhlbc1jv7ohf1.png,"Sigaro, 9/10","This has been a kind of addiction for the past few week, safe to say i think it's pretty damn tasty.

- Price: 60DA is the lowest i found at two 'supérettes' while i also found a small shop that sells it for 75DA so be aware, all in all i think 60DA is a fair price for the quantity.

- Flavor and packaging: comes in a single peanut cream flavor but the color of the package may change as it comes in the shown red, white and an additional yellow.

- Additional info: 
-- One packet comes at around 410kcal, did the math for y'all gym bros out there ;⁠)
-- Pairs well with a drink (soft drink, tea, coffee).
-- Not too sweet in my opinion, which is a plus.

Happy snacking.

It made me feel dumb! Does the game explain this? Are there any good guides who do this?

I have been strugling for example with my archers. When shooting at a knight, they do 1 or 2 damage. I must’ve done something wrong.

Just wrapped up 8 months of nights/weekends building a research paper organization tool. Finally have something I'm proud of, but promotion is kicking my ass 😅

**The project:**

* Helps academics/PhD students organize, highlight, and search through research papers
* Built with Next.js, React, and a lot of coffee ☕
* Started because I was drowning in PDFs during my own research
* 2 beta users so far (mostly from university friends)

**Screenshots:** \[I'd love to share some but want to get feedback on promotion first!\]

**What I've tried**

* Twitter posts (my 25 followers were very supportive lol)
* Preparing for Product Hunt launch

**Where I'm hitting walls:** Getting those first 1000 users feels impossible. I know the product helps people (beta users love it), but I'm terrible at marketing myself.

**Brutally honest feedback wanted:**

1. **How did you get your first real users?** Not friends/family - actual strangers who found value
2. **Best free promotion channels you've discovered?** Budget = $0 until I start making money
3. **How do you promote without feeling like a sleazy salesperson?** I hate self-promotion but know I have to do it
4. **Timeline reality check:** Is 1000 users in 6 months realistic for a solo dev? Or am I being naive?

**What I can help with in return:**

* PDF processing and text extraction (learned a LOT about this)
* Next.js/React optimization tips
* Customer validation process (competitors exists.)
* Always happy to test and give feedback on others' projects!

Really appreciate this community - seeing everyone's journeys here keeps me motivated when the solo grind gets tough.

Next brother and his wife bicker. Constantly. Every little thing. He once said if he walked on water he'd be bitched at for making ripples. Two lovely kids; they'll grow old together, bitching about everything on the way.

Not peer-reviewed research, just a guy who's played too many games that felt like depressive experiences.

  
**So I've been thinking...** (dangerous, I know)

 

You know that feeling when you spend $70 on the latest AAA blockbuster and three hours later you're back to playing some indie game that cost $15? Not just me? Cool, cool :)

 

**But seriously, what's up with the pattern where bigger budgets = more boring games?**

 

Like **Concord** had more money thrown at it than hometown GDP (literally), and it lasted exactly as long as my last relationship (not literally, I’m married since 2016 ). At the same time, some solo dev with a laptop and a dream creates **Vampire Survivors** and suddenly everyone's addicted (I know, it’s a bit of a stretch, but you know what I mean, right?).

 

**So I came up with a ""Six Horsemen of Why AAA Sucks Now"" theory:**

 

1. **Corporate Fear** \- When you're holding $200/300/500M of not exactly your money, every decision gets focus-grouped to death. ""What if someone gets offended by \[blank\]?"" Result: games so safe they're $70 sleeping pills.
2. **Too Many Cooks** \- GTA 6seems to has 4,500 people working on it. Ever tried to order pizza with 10 friends? Do you remember your school projects? Now imagine coordinating a creative vision with 4,500. It works sometimes but usually associated with a very tough leader. And crunches. 
3. **The Restart Addiction** \- *Skull and Bones* was apparently restarted so many times I'm convinced they briefly considered making it a mobile resource grinder with toddler’s UI and mechanics. Oh wait... Each restart = millions down the drain.
4. **Q4 Insanity** \- Missing Christmas sales isn't an option, so games get yeeted out half-finished. In filmmaking they say ""we'll fix it in post"" in gamedev - ""we'll fix it in patches."" 
5. **Monetization Cancer** \- Design meetings change from ""Is this fun?"" to ""Can we sell this as a $20 DLC?"" Those Ubisoft’s pay-to-progress systems and boosters are unforgettable, eh?
6. **Development Hell Decay** \- Some games take so long that they're culturally irrelevant by launch. Hello, *Star Citizen*, Beyond Good&Evil 2 (13 years and counting).

 

**The weird part?** The games that ignore all this corporate nonsense keep becoming massive hits. **Baldur's Gate 3** told publishers to stuff it, kept creative control, and became everyone's new obsession. **Palworld** was made by a tiny team and the internet on fire (and Nintendo asses, more importantly, hehe).

 

**Maybe**, just maybe, creativity doesn't scale with budget? Revolutionary concept, I know.

 

Am I completely wrong? What is the most overbudgeted disappointment you've personally paid a **full price** for?

[Here is a photo of the parking garage under my building, where I was filming a video and calculating a failure rate of all games with a budget over $200M.

That I’m strong.
That I don’t need anyone.
And most days, that’s true enough to keep going.
But other days… I feel the hollow space beside me so deeply it almost aches.

I miss being someone’s person.
Not just existing, but being held in mind. Checked in on. Protected. Loved.
Not having to carry everything alone.

I don’t want to be the one who always figures it out, carries the groceries, fixes the lightbulbs, paints the walls, makes the plans.
I can do it. I have done it.
But sometimes I just want to sit in the passenger seat, feel the sun on my skin, and let someone else take the wheel.
I want to be looked at like I’m special. Like I’m a soft place to land.
Like I matter.

I miss the quiet things
The warmth of someone holding me close, like their body remembered I belonged there.
Being able to say “I had a rough day” and not have to explain more.
I miss that shared rhythm - knowing someone’s habits, knowing their scent, feeling like a home was built between us, not just around me.

I try so hard to be the strong, capable woman.
The one who doesn’t rely, who doesn’t ask, who doesn’t need.
But God, I’m tired.
Tired of doing life solo.
Tired of pretending I don’t care when I see couples laugh in cafes or hold hands at crosswalks.

It’s not about fairy tales or grand gestures.
It’s about presence. Safety.
Someone who knows how I like my coffee and pulls me closer when I get quiet.
Someone who makes life feel less heavy, just by being in it.

I miss love.
But more than that - I miss being loved in a way that softens me, not hardens me.

I don’t want to do this life all by myself.
I can. But I don’t want to.

1mkdbnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mkdbnc/there_is_a_sound_coming_from_the_woods_in_our/,There is a sound coming from the woods in our town. Now all of the children are running west.,"I reached Birchlow as if I had outrun the heat but I had not outrun it. It rode behind me all the way. The town lay on the land like a thin scar. The blacktop ran from a grain elevator past a rusted spur of rail and on toward a mile of hardwoods where no axe had sounded for a long generation. A figure on the courthouse steps drew itself into a man as I approached. It was the sheriff. He held a paper cup of coffee that I had not asked for. He wore the expression of someone who had reached the end of his own reckoning and found there was nothing left to count.

“Are you Renn?” he said.

“I am,” I said.

“Lyle Carter,” he said. “I am the sheriff. I have lived here all my life and that is not a recommendation. We have six missing now.” He studied the shine on the coffee as if he expected a face to rise from it. “Will you come inside?”

The courthouse air was old. It smelled like damp paper gone to dirt and like pencil shavings and chalk dust. You know that smell. It is the smell of sorrows recorded and shelved. Files were piled along the desks in small gray cliffs. He set the coffee down on a blotter that had been marked with a dull pencil until it looked like a map of an unfamiliar country. Near his elbow lay a list of names. Some had been struck through with a heavy line.

“Did you cross out those names because you found them?” I said.

He did not lift his eyes from the paper. “No,” he said. “That is a different list.” He flipped the page over and left it facedown as if it might watch him otherwise.

“All right,” I said.

He slid a folder toward me across the wood. Photographs slipped out of it and fan shaped across the desk like a losing hand. Twelve. Ten. Nine. Eight. They were small faces. Ears that had not settled on their heads yet. Teeth too big for their mouths. Each one was the center of a world for somebody else.

“When did they vanish?” I said.

“They disappeared on different nights over the last two weeks,” he said. He pressed his fingers into the bridge of his nose as if a memory might come out if he did not hold it in. “There is no single time that repeats. It is always after dark. The older ones put the little ones to bed, according to the parents. The young ones climb back out of their beds. The doors are locked. The windows are locked. Except when they are not locked. Except when everyone talks and then everyone feels like a liar.”

“Did you put out an alert?” I said.

“We sent alerts statewide and regional,” he said. “We sent AMBER alerts. We used dogs. We used planes. Half the county is out with flashlights every night, working grid lines. The kids vanish as if the ground decides it is finished holding them up.”

“Did any of them have phones?” I said.

“Two of them did,” he said. “Both went dead at the north edge, past the last houses and before the trees.”

“The woods,” I said.

“They call that edge the Break,” he said.

“Do you mean the Break?” I said.

“That is the name,” he said. “Kids go there when they want to be invisible. Teenagers go to kiss and drink. There is nothing out there but mosquitoes and old stone. We found one meth lab five years ago. We have seen nothing like this since. There are no signs. There is nothing you can put your hand on.”

He took one more sheet from a teetering stack and held it for a long moment before he laid it between us face down like a pale, flat threat.

“What is that?” I said.

“You told me to be honest,” he said. “I am going to be honest. People have been calling in with sightings.”

“What have they seen?” I said.

“They think they have seen the kids,” he said, and his voice sounded like something far away at the bottom of a well. “They see them in town, late at night. They are running.”

“Where are they running?” I said.

“West,” he said. “They run west. Every time.”

He turned the paper over. It was a doorbell camera print. Six children passed a porch in a blur. Their arms were not pumping. They were locked straight behind them. Their chests pitched forward as if a wire had taken them by the ribs and pulled. Their mouths were open. Their eyes were dull. At the back a boy’s leg was dark from knee to ankle. His sock had turned black. He did not seem to know about the blood.

“Do you have that clip?” I said.

“We do,” he said. “A neighbor posted it on a neighborhood watch page and we pulled it down.”

He gave me a memory stick with the file. He gave me the coffee that had gone cold. I took both and walked out into the growing heat.

I went to the houses. I spoke with the mothers and the fathers and the people who had once been their friends and now could not look at them without crying. I listened to a schoolteacher and a gas station clerk. People held my sleeve with both hands and they would not let go. I let them. In the past I have not always let them.

A woman named Lydia Monroe stood in her kitchen twisting a damp dish towel. She had the towel pressed to her mouth as if she could force her screams back down. Her son’s name was Eli. He was ten years old. He should have been riding a bicycle and learning the small crimes you commit to test the world. He should not have been learning this.

“He did not run away,” she said. Her voice was hard and flat. “Please do not ask me that. Please do not insult us.”

“I am not here to insult you,” I said. “Would you tell me again how it happened.”

“He ate dinner,” she said. “He watched a clip of something silly. His sister told him goodnight and he told her goodnight. I checked him at nine and his hair was stuck to his forehead and I thought he was asleep. At ten the cat meowed at the back door. I went to let it in. The latch was slid back and only I touch that latch.” She held up the towel and the towel muffled her speech into a low hopeless sound. “He did not take his shoes.”

“What was in his pockets?” I said.

“Nothing was in his pockets,” she said. “He does not like pockets. He says they make his shorts heavy.”

I stood in Eli’s room. It looked like a museum of a life interrupted. There were baseball caps on a hook. There were colored bricks still waiting to be knocked over. A single shoe lay on its side as if it had been tripped. The window screen was screwed tight. I checked the screws. They were seated clean. I took some cold solace in that because it gave me one small thing that still obeyed a rule.

By sundown the motel bedspread had become my map of the world. It was a cheap atlas scored with a grease pencil. The lines all ran one way. They ran west. My laptop played the camera clips on a loop. I watched the gray ghosts run their route over and over. My finger traced the lines I had drawn and they left the town and entered the block of shadow that marked the trees.

At 10:18 by the car clock I put on my jacket and I drove. I moved slow through Birchlow. The town folded itself up. Porch lights snapped off. A bug zapper crackled in the dark like a little gallows. I drove down the street from the video because I wanted to see the light fall in the same pattern. Behind a chain link fence two hounds stood rigid. They did not bark.

I killed the engine and sat listening. The quiet was wrong for summer. The crickets had fallen still as if a hawk’s shadow had passed. Then I heard it. At first I thought it was wind in my own head but the leaves hung motionless. The sound came from the west. It was a hum at the edge of hearing, a fine thread drawn taut.

They did not so much appear as resolve out of the dark. It was as if the world had only just been printed and the ink of their bodies had not dried. There were six children moving together in the center of the road. Their arms were thrown back. Their heads tilted forward. The slap of their bare feet on the pavement made a wet sound that traveled up my jaw and into my teeth. The boy with the bloodied leg left a dark line along the macadam like a pen that leaked.

I stepped out and raised my hand. “Please stop,” I said. “Stop. I need you to stop.”

The lead child slid past me as if I had been a rock in a shallow river. The second brushed my coat. His shoulder held a cold that did not belong to the night. I took the third by the arm. She was a girl. Her eyes met mine for a brief second. They looked gray and filmed as if from sleep. Her pupils were wide. They did not answer the light. For an instant I thought I saw the treeline reflected in them and upside down. Her arm gave a single dry twitch and then went slack. She let her weight go as only a child can and my grip slipped. She ran.

“Jesus Christ,” I said aloud to the empty air. The bleeding boy limped, but the limp did not slow him. The line of his blood unspooled from somewhere inside him.

I got in the car and let it roll beside them. I kept the window down. I spoke as you speak to a feral animal you want to tame.

“All right,” I said. “Listen to me. Where are you going. Eli, if that is you, I want you to answer me.”

The bleeding boy turned his head a fraction. He opened his mouth. His lips did not form a word. A whisper came out of him that was dry and old. “We are almost there,” he said.

“Almost where,” I said.

He turned his head forward again. They all did. They moved like a single thought that ran through them all from another place.

I nosed the car into the street ahead of them and idled. They broke left without hesitation. They flowed onto the sidewalk and around the car and back to the road. Their hands were turned outward at their backs. The hum grew louder as if it were pleased to be known. I followed behind them. They passed the last lit house and the last pretense of town and entered the corridor of trees. The road turned to gravel and then gave up being a road at all. The woods pressed down hard. The weight came from the ground itself. I stopped the car. I watched them go into the black.

“This is bad,” I said to the empty cab. I said it again.

I did not follow yet. I got out and I used a paint pen I keep for field marks. I marked the asphalt where the last footfalls had landed. A line of white crosses along a country road. It would look to anyone else like mean graffiti. To me it felt like a prayer against what was coming.

I slept in my clothes. In the shallow sleep that followed I saw arms thrown back against darkness and a line of blood that ran along a road with no end. It was a string tied to something at the center of the dark.

In the morning I woke to the sound of a vacuum in the motel hall and for a moment I thought it was teeth being sanded. I stood in the shower and let the water run until it scalded. The burn was proof that my body still answered.

Back at the sheriff’s office we laid out the maps on a table. Lyle called in his deputy. She was Rose Keegan. She was ten years younger than I am. Her eyes held a hunger for the work that I may have once had but could not find. She had a new notebook and a pen that clicked with a sound like a small weapon being cocked. She had made a copy of my clip. She pushed her laptop across the scarred wood.

“I slowed this down,” she said. “Would you watch their shoulders.”

We watched the gray phantoms run their course. The children’s shoulders did not move to pump momentum. The shoulders were held back until the blades pressed the fabric of their shirts. Their arms were not for balance. They were held as if anchored while the bodies dragged forward.

“It is like they are falling off the front of themselves,” I said.

“It is like something has them by the sternum,” Rose said. She looked as if she regretted saying it. “I am sorry. That sounds foolish.”

“It does not sound foolish,” I said. “I understand.”

She nodded as if the permission helped. Lyle stood at the county map on the wall.

“They always go west,” he said. He pressed a thumb into the paper where the road bled out into gravel. “They vanish here. We have walked it over and over. I could trace that path with my eyes closed. The dogs go dumb. They whine they piss they sit.”

“What about cameras farther out?” I said.

“Doorbells took them as far as Maple and Hickory,” Rose said. “We have four angles. It is the same each time. After that, nothing. People out there keep their money in jars and their privacy set in cement.”

I met the elementary school teacher at lunch. Her name was Ms. Ahmed. She had a face that had weathered twenty years of small truths from children and large lies from adults. She slid a stack of drawings across her desk. I smiled and then the smile left me. On every page there was a circle in a corner. It was not a sun or a moon. It was a circle with a wedge missing.

“This was last week’s art,” Ms. Ahmed said. “We told them to draw where they go after school. A lot of kids drew swings. Some drew the gas station, which I liked for reasons I cannot explain. This shape kept showing up.”

“What do they say it is?” I said.

“They do not say,” she said. “They shrug. One boy said it was a mouth. Then he laughed because he knew it was not a mouth. Then he stopped laughing.”

“Did anyone mention anything else?” I said.

“They mentioned a hum,” she said. “I told a girl she might be hearing the substation. She looked at me as if I had said there were wolves in the classroom. I felt foolish.”

In the school lot poplar fluff drifted like ash. I called the parents again. I asked about fevers and medications and late-night watchers and who drove by on their roads. My phone rang in my hand while I was holding it. A local number I did not know.

It was a child’s voice. It sounded like air pushed through a dry reed.

“Detective Renn,” the voice said.

“Who is this,” I said.

“Hurry,” the voice said. “The last one is left behind. The last one is left.” The line went dead.

I called the number back and heard a phone ringing inside the sheriff’s office. Lyle held the desk receiver away from his face like a snake. His eyes were flat.

“What are you doing,” he said.

“Did your phone dial out?” I said.

“It rang once,” he said. “Then it dialed by itself. I am not a fearful man, Renn. I do not scare easy. I do not like this.”

The cold thread in my chest tightened.

We went out into the night. Rose drove with the windows down. The air smelled of cut grass and of a sweetness below it that was rot. We killed the engine where the road gave out and let the car roll in silence. We stepped out. The sound was there. The hum threaded straight through the quiet and into the meat of the mind.

“Wait,” Rose said. “Please listen. Do you hear that.”

The hum had a texture in it. Little sounds nested within it like bad eggs. A voice hid in the white noise like the static drift of a radio that only speaks when you pass beneath a bridge. I heard a child’s voice woven in it and something deeper that put the taste of pennies on my tongue. I moved a step and the tone shifted. I moved again and it shifted again. The direction was a lie. It came from everywhere and from one specific place that was not a place, the dark space between three birch trunks that stood like ribs torn up from the earth.

Then I saw them. There were four children this time. I saw Eli. The boy with the bloody leg was not among them. The four came straight out of the trees and crossed the road. Their arms were still locked behind them. I stood in Eli’s path and he ran around me without looking. Rose breathed a word that was part prayer and part curse. She reached for a small form with the care you use in a dark hallway when you do not want to frighten someone you love. The child’s breath came in a cloud of cold that touched Rose’s throat and she recoiled and caught herself and set her feet again.

“Look at me,” I said. “Please look at me.”

They did not. They ran west and were gone. We followed to the line of trees and the hum grew until it was not a sound you heard but a thing you felt inside you. I stopped. Something snapped a branch at the level of my face though no branch moved.

We stood on the edge and listened to our lungs. I turned my head and when I looked back it seemed as if the trees had come closer by the width of a thumb.

“Do you feel that,” Rose said. Her hand was on my arm. Her other hand was on the butt of her pistol and we both knew it would do no good against noise.

“I feel it,” I said. “Back out. Take it slow.”

We stepped backward. The hum receded and the insects began again and with them my own heart. The gravel made an old sound under my boots. On the shoulder lay a dark smear. I knelt. I wanted it to be oil. It was not oil. I touched it and I smelled my finger.

“It is blood,” I said. “It is fresh.”

“We have to go in,” Rose said. Her voice was steady. “We are going to have to go in and we need to be smart.”

“Yes,” I said. “We will not go empty handed.”

We drove stakes into the soft shoulder by the blood. We would come back with rope. We would come back with light. We would come back with names.

The man at the hardware store did not ask questions. I bought one hundred feet of climbing rope and a handful of screw gate carabiners. I bought bright survey tape and three flares for a county with flat roads.

“Are you going to try to tie up a tornado?” he said.

“If it gets this far,” I said.

We did not sleep so much as we passed out and woke up. The sheriff called for volunteers with dogs trained to track. At the edge of the trees the dogs stopped. They whined a thin whine. They lay down and shivered in waves as if the hair on their backs wanted to flee the skin.

We went in at dusk when the sky looked like a new bruise. I tied the rope to a maple as thick as a refrigerator and looped it twice and clipped myself in. Rose clipped in behind me. Lyle made a loop at his waist and none of us laughed at his knots.

“Do you hear it,” I said.

“I hear it,” Rose said. Her eyes in the fading light would not hold still. “The tone is lower now.”

We stepped past the line. The rope trailed behind us heavy as a serpent. I tied survey tape to branches and the orange looked obscene against the green. The woods smelled of wet earth and iron. The leaves were a dark, cramped green that pushed into my face like pressure.

I marked the trunks with chalk. The chalk made a white idiot scrawl. My hand trembled but I did not know if it was me or the tone in my jaw.

“Why children?” Lyle said. His voice came out too soft. “Why not fish. Why not something else.”

The sound of his voice did not carry in any normal way. It felt swallowed and then returned in pieces. The last words came back in three faint echoes, something else, something else, something else.

We followed a path our feet knew before our eyes recognized it. The ground had been walked not by a mob but by many careful passings. I found the print of a small sneaker and beside it the weave of a sock in the mud where a shoe had been left behind. The path sloped into a hollow.

You know a bowl in the earth when you enter one. Your hearing changes. The trees lean away as the ground gives. In the center of the hollow was a black place. It had no reflection. It did not read as water at first. Then a tremor passed across it and my stomach answered before my eyes could. It was water. If it had ever held a sky, it did not hold one now.

They stood on the far bank in a line. Eli was there. Mari with two crooked braids. Tucker with a bruised knee. Two more whose faces I knew from pale copies. Their arms no longer held behind them. Their arms hung by their sides and this seemed worse because it made the moment ordinary.

“Eli,” I said. My voice went into the hollow and came back in a dented echo.

“Do not take a step into that,” Rose said. Her whisper was fierce. “That is wet clay. It will take you to your knees with one step.”

“I know,” I said. 

The hum had dropped away. A lower note lived there now. Then a voice shaped itself in the shape of the silence. It sounded like a grandmother who had never been near a child.

“I am older than this,” it said. It did not use sound. It spoke by causing birds to fall quiet and by raising the hairs at the back of the neck. “You give them to me every night. You place them in rows. You teach them to rise when they are called.”

“Do not speak to it,” Lyle said.

“Who should I speak to then,” I said. I raised my hand. “Eli, can you see me. Can you hear me. Please look at me and hold my eyes.”

His eyes lifted as if with a great weight on them. When his gaze met mine it passed through me. He opened his mouth and his lips were the color of lead. Cold breath left him in a little cloud.

“We are almost there,” he said. He was not speaking to me. He was saying it to himself.

“Where is ‘there’,” I said. “Tell me what you see.”

Mari spoke. Her voice sounded like dry paper rubbed together. “Home,” she said. “I mean my other home.”

“That is right,” said the trees, or I made them say it, or it was my memory of how wind in a tree can sound if you want it to speak. “It is not pain. It is the place behind your eyes when the itch comes and you cannot sleep. Come across. You walk backward everywhere else and fall. I will lift you. I will put you down in the place where the noise stops.”

“Renn,” Rose said. Her voice was close. “We must get them away from that black water.”

I stepped forward and the mud took me. In a breath it held me to the shin and then to the knee. The rope went hard behind me. Rose took my weight and sat back into the harness. I could have loved her for that simple thing.

The shape in the hollow pulled itself into a greater height or else the trees leaned down to frame it. There was the suggestion of a head and shoulders in the negative space and it did not look like any creature that belongs to our names. The air around it grew so cold my teeth ached.

“You need to let them go,” I said. My voice sounded foolish.

“They are not yours,” the not-voice said. “They are not yours in any of the places where they cry. They come when the door opens and when the bell rings. You will say that I took them. I did not take them. I call and they obey. You taught them obedience until they slide.”

Lyle breathed fast behind me. “What is it saying,” he said.

“It is trying to sound reasonable,” I said. “Do not let it.”

Mari’s left foot slid forward and the mud closed on it. She wavered. She put out her hands. The rope jerked as Rose leaned back with all her weight. I took another step. Eli stared at the water the way a man looks at a drop when he has decided to jump.

“I know that voice,” I said to Eli. “I know the voice that tells you the easy way. There is no easy way here. Eli, if you step, I will come after you and I am heavier and I will take us both down and your mother will kill me and I will deserve it.”

He blinked. The water breathed toward my thighs.

“Give me their names,” Rose said. She spoke without looking away from the rope. I gave her the names and she said their names aloud. She filled the hollow with sounds that did not belong to the hum. She said the names the way you call a dog that does not know you belong to it yet. She said the names as if each name was the best word she knew. “Eli. Mari. Tucker.”

Something that looked like a hand swept across the far bank. A ring of woven grass with a ribbon tied to it fell from the branches. It landed near my hand. Gifts or garbage. There was no difference that I could see.

“Elsewhere,” it said. The word tied a knot in my gut. “Elsewhere is what your grandmother said when she was dying and she did not know a word to clothe it. Elsewhere is not cold and not hot and it has no sound. They are tired of sound. Do not put them in rows. Do not put numbers in their mouths. Do not teach them to move together and then blame me for calling them.”

“You do not get to use them as an experiment,” I said. I could not feel my feet. The cold had climbed to my thighs. “You call them and I understand why. But you do not get them. That is the rule.”

“It is the way you have kept the rule,” the voice said with the weary weight of history. It did not sound angry. It sounded tired. “Tonight, if you will wrench them back, wrench them. The door is open. The hinges sing. It will open again.”

“Go to hell,” I said. I did not say it calmly. I shouted it and Rose flinched and Lyle swore.

I lunged and took Tucker by the wrist. The cold in his skin sank into my bones. He turned and his face was the face of a man who had known me for fifty years. He let out a long breath like a diver breaking the surface. I pulled. The mud made a sound I do not want to name. Rose hauled the rope. Lyle dug in his heels. We moved an inch. The shape shifted and the air fell in temperature the way freezer air falls out into summer.

“Go the other way, Tucker,” I said. “Take the rope in your free hand and go the other way.”

He took the line. His knuckles scraped and he did not complain. Children do not complain because they learn not to.

Mari reached. Her eyes did not leave the black. Her lip shook. The water licked her shoe. I took her hand and held both of them and felt nothing in my own fingers. Eli shook his head slowly. He took a step toward the water. Rose said his name and her voice cut the air.

“Eli,” she said.

He looked at Tucker. He looked at Mari. Something inside him shifted. He took a step back. The mud held him and then released him with a sound like something pulled from a socket. He fell. Rose had a hand for him. She hauled him in and set her feet like a sailor and we started to move. We moved backward and the water came to the lip but went no farther. When we crossed the rim the tone returned, high and hard with anger.

“I am a utility,” it said. “I am a kindness. You never give me the old. You never give me the sick. You send me the bright ones polished smooth. The ones who know how to go when they are called. I will not thank you again.”

“I do not require your thanks,” I said. I was not brave. I was shaking with the cold and with anger and with a relief that hurt.

We did not run. We walked backward as if the ground could be trusted if we watched it. When the rope went slack we unbuckled. The dogs were barking in the distance. They were singing our names. We came out under a sky that was turning pink.

We did not stop to throw up or to pray. We put the children in the sheriff’s vehicle and we drove them into town. People came out in their bare feet and their thin shirts.

Lydia Monroe ran a whole block and then took two breaths and made a sound that I will hear in the last minute of my life. She touched her son’s hair as if afraid of how it might feel.

“Do not send them home tonight,” I said to Lyle. “Do not put them in rooms alone. Put them in the gym under lights. It does not matter how it looks. Please do it.”

He nodded. His face was white. He did it. The town brought quilts and lamps. The lamps hummed with a common electricity. The children slept in a loose pile on the gym floor like puppies. Adults sat with them and the great room held the noise of human breathing.

We thought we had made a plan. We were wrong about the nature of the plan, but not as wrong as I had feared.

Nine children slept on the gym floor. Four we had pulled from the mud. Five others had been found in the dark on the edges of town and brought in. They slept with the complete sleep of the very young. The hum was still there. It was faint like a mosquito high in the rafters. Every adult’s eyes were bruised with a lack of sleep. Only the rescued slept without turning.

“I do not like this,” Rose said. “It feels like we put them all in one basket and hung it up for someone to take.”

“We keep them where we can see them,” I said.

At two in the morning the lights flickered once. The power strips buzzed like bees in a jar. The pitch of the hum shifted with the buzz. Space heaters clicked off and the children stirred.

“Get the generator,” Lyle said, and the lights came back with a hard surge.

“All right,” Rose said to the open air. “We are all right. We can handle this.”

We were not all right. At three thirty, Mari sat up. She slid her arms behind her back in a long stretch. Her eyes were closed. Then they opened. They did not see. She stood. Eli stood. Tucker stood. They all stood as one. The hum formed a tight chord that stripped other sounds out of the room.

“No,” I said. I said it loud on purpose. “No. Please stop. Listen to me.”

They began to walk. They did not run. They moved like people called to an appointment they cannot miss. Their arms went back. Their shadows trailed like ropes.

“Sweetheart,” I said to Mari. I stood between her and the door. “You are safe. Please look at me. There is nothing outside that you need. You are here.”

I set my palm on her shoulder. Her shoulder was cold enough to burn.

“Call for backup,” Lyle said into his radio. The radio was dead. It made no sound.

“Open the doors,” I said.

“Why would we open them,” he said.

“If they run they will run,” I said. “If we make a bottleneck they will break it and they will trample someone. We will keep pace and we will take them back before the trees.”

It sounded foolish. It was the only plan left to us. Lyle threw the heavy latches. The night air came in.

“Rose,” I said. “Play the recording.”

She pulled her phone. Her hands shook but she found the file. The hum from the woods came thin and tiny through her phone speakers. It was wrong, but the wrongness made my eyes water. The children flinched.

“Do it again,” I said. “Raise it and drop it. Scramble them. Do it again.”

She did it. She slid the sound up and down. It bit and fell back and bit again. The children’s stride faltered. Eli shook his head as if someone had him by the hair and then let go.

“Say their names,” I said.

We called names like school on a bad day. We said them until their shapes were right in our mouths. “Eli. Mari. Tucker. June. Dan. Ava.” The tone seemed to hate the noise we made. It felt like a foolish idea to think a sound can hate, but it felt true.

They moved faster. We ran. We ran out onto the blacktop, across paint lines from the games of children. We ran across the ball field and into the street. The town was lit like a stage, with street lamps and porch lights and halogen work lights somebody had dragged out. The children passed through cones of light like a school of silver fish. A small girl named Ava had a thin line of blood at her hairline. It broke and slid down past her eye. She did not blink. I reached for her and touched only air.

“Move,” I said, and we moved. People watched from doorways and windows like a crowd on a bridge. No one knew whether they should look away or not.

We hit the gravel and the world narrowed. The tone was not everywhere now. It came from one place. It lay ahead and to the left. I had tied the line around my waist back in the gym as a superstition. Superstition became useful. Rose clipped in. We trusted our feet. The children found the path as if the path remembered them.

The trees drew into a chasm and we went down. There was no time for ritual. The hollow was blacker than the night around it. The water in it did not ripple outward. It pulled inward like a mouth.

“Ava,” I said. “Look at my hand. Please look exactly at my hand.”

The voice came from the trees and this time it carried the easy cadence of a small town principal laying out rules.

“Bring them. You want to sleep. You want to be done arranging your little lines. You want to stop pretending what you do matters. Bring them and I will take them to where the story is finished and they do not starve for sense.”

“You want them because they still believe in directions,” I said. “Do not think I do not know that trick. I have used that trick. The answer is no.”

“You love it when they line up,” the voice said, and it used my tone to say it. “You love it when they move and are quiet. You hate the noise and the mess and you do not know what to do when the world hurts.”

I should have let it pass. Instead I said, “Get out of my head.” The sound that came back was a clinking as of a spoon on the rim of a glass.

We had brought no salt. We had brought none of the old rules. We had brought rope and our names and their names. It was enough because they were enough. I took Ava. Rose took Eli. Lyle threw the long end of the line like a sash around Mari and he crushed her to him and walked backward. We fell into a pattern.

On the far side a shadow swept the ground. It lifted dirt and leaves and the scraps of a childhood no one had noticed and blew them in our faces. The grit stung. The tone cut. My sleeve was wet and with nothing that came from the pool. We were crying. All of us cried who had not cried in public in ten years.

“The rope,” I said. “I need the rope.”

We made a chain of the rope and our bodies. We tied it to a stump. We threaded it through our belts and around their small ribs. We pulled and dragged and we left skin on bark. I do not remember the ten seconds that came next. I remember that Tucker slipped and scraped his foot on the black water and he screamed. We had not heard him make a sound until that moment.

“Good,” I said like a madman. “That is the right noise to make. Keep yelling. Please yell for me.”

He yelled. They all yelled. I had not known that the sound of a child crying out could be a weapon. The tone bucked against it. We stole a foot of ground and then another. We reached the lip. We fell backward over it in a heap. Rose laughed the laugh of someone who thought she understood gravity for the first time. We lay there a long moment with our legs bleeding and we did not go back.

Behind us, the sound stopped. It stopped long enough for us to count out breaths. Then it returned thin and patient.

We ran and we did not talk. The children’s arms came forward and hung at their sides. I believed in that miracle and in no other. The dogs met us at the trees and then backed away, ashamed of their arrival.

Inside the hospital the nurses wrapped them warm and asked soft questions. Parents came and did not apologize for their tears. Eli put his hands on his mother’s face as if she were the child and he was the one who had returned to her. I hated the sight of that reversal and I loved it. I had lost my composure and I did not care. Rose put a hand on my shoulder and said near my ear as if she were ashamed to be kind, “You did a good job.”

The phrase fits poorly on the world, but hearing it then made my throat burn in a way the tone had not.

For thirty six hours Birchlow smiled with the skin around its eyes. The gym was cleaned. Parents slept on hospital floors beside their children. A church brought sandwiches. Lyle went on local radio and said, “We brought them back.” He did not say how or why. He said only that it was done. Rose slept on the sheriff’s office couch like a cat. I went to the motel and stood in a shower until I could tell hot from cold again.

On the second morning I woke from two hours with my heart hammering. I thought I heard the tone. It was the air conditioner. Your brain makes a sound for you after it has heard that sound for too long.

I opened the blinds. The morning looked like a bleached orange shirt. Dew rose from the yards. A cat sat in the street like an omen.

A boy ran by.

He ran alone. His arms were held straight behind him. His head was pitched forward and his mouth hung open. The soles of his feet slapped the tar. A line of blood ran down his leg. It was not Dan. It could have been Dan. It could have been the one child who is all children. He ran west. He did not look at me. He breathed like someone pulled through a hole that is too small.

“Hey,” I said, and I said it too softly for anyone to hear. I put my hand to the glass. The boy turned a corner and was gone. I could not hear the tone. I did not need to hear it.

I set the coffee down. I put on my boots and I did not lace them. I took my rope. I spoke to the empty room and to the ugly painting of a lighthouse bolted over the bed.

“All right,” I said.

Outside, the town had gone back to itself. A man watered his lawn. A woman buckled a child into a car seat and kissed the child’s forehead. I wanted to tell her to wrap the child in quilts and to hum the wrong notes until daylight, but I did not say anything.

The boy’s footprints made little dark ellipses in the dew. Seeing them hurt. The line of blood along the asphalt pointed west.

The bright orange ribbon I tied to the maple at the edge of the woods still hung. In daylight it looked stupid. The hum did not come. The woods stood as if bored by their work. A crow called to a crow.

I stepped into the trees.

“Names,” I said to myself. “Give me the names.”

I said my own name to the trees. I said, “Renn.” The word went out and came back. It was only a name. It held no power, but it was what I had. I carried my rope and my chalk and my empty hands into a woods that had already learned me.",1,1754603739.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Just being childish and not wanting to pay bills.  I've been in less than savory situations where I've lived couch to couch with family and random ""friends"". Every now and then when I get myself into a good grove and have a little money my family wants to be around. Back story, I don't have the best relationship with my mom, being her oldest daughter and from a different man than the other 3 siblings, I get treated different.  I've been told she spat in my food (true or not it was wrong to say to your child), as a teenager she would choose  her boyfriends over me and even left me on the streets because her husband didn't like me. I did nothing to the man, I'm very much a sit in my room and play video games person so you won't know I'm there unless you happen to see me run to the restroom. I don't have kids running around the house like my brother did but I was the problem somehow.

 I've always kept a job. Just mismanagement of money early on. I never got to do a lot of things and wasn't the priority when getting presents and birthday gifts growing up. Once Covid hit, we all kind of moved in the same area to be close. I started living with my brother then he put me out because he wanted his house back and I moved in with my sister (my mom was living with her). I was wfh for a few years and since we've been allowed outside again I also started working at the local hotel on weekends doing double shifts to just be out of the house. My sister found a house and her and her BF (and soon to be baby) moved into there,  I took over her apartment and my mom stayed put. 

Now, my mom feels like this is her apartment.  I pay bills, rent, and I buy all house items. ( tp, washing power, dish soap, trash bags all of it). My mom does pay internet ($70 her choice which she let's get cut off due to a double bill even after I pay it in full to get back on becuase i wfh) and she buys maybe $100 worth of groceries. Thru the month she still needs cigarettes and a coke and a candy bar and even coffee creamer so the $100 she spends is kinda voided. For my birthday my mom bought me a pair of slippers socks. She threw a party for my siblings on their birthday.  I walked in on my mom talking about me to her friends otp and how I go out of town 3 times a year and always having packages delivered and playing my video games.  She complains about everything.

## Key Features Analysis

The best rustic sofa tables in 2025 boast a combination of durability, aesthetic appeal, and functional design elements that set them apart from run-of-the-mill furniture. These tables are carefully crafted to meet the demands of modern living while maintaining thier unique charm.

**Durable Wood Composition**

A High-quality rustic sofa table should be constructed from solid wood or durable engineered wood. Real wood offers unparalleled strength and a natural aesthetic,while engineered wood provides a more cost-effective and warp-resistant option. Look for tables made from hardwoods like oak, pine, or reclaimed wood with a minimum thickness of one inch for the tabletop and legs to ensure stability and longevity. The type of wood influences not only the structural integrity but also the overall character of the table.

**Distressed Finish and Texture**

The Distressed finish is a signature characteristic of rustic furniture. this finish often involves techniques like sanding, staining, and applying a textured coating to create a worn or aged appearance. Authentic distressing enhances the table's rustic charm, giving it a unique and timeless look. Check that the distressing is done thoughtfully and consistently across all surfaces to avoid a haphazard or artificial affect. This enhances the visual appeal and also hides everyday wear and tear, making it ideal for homes with active families.

**Integrated Storage solutions**

Many Modern rustic sofa tables come equipped with integrated storage solutions such as drawers,shelves,and cabinets. These features provide a practical way to keep your living space organized and clutter-free. Drawers should have smooth gliding mechanisms and sturdy construction to handle frequent use. Shelves should be spacious enough to accommodate books, baskets, or decorative items. Cabinets with doors can conceal items,adding a touch of elegance and privacy to your storage.

**Reinforced Metal Accents**

Metal Accents, such as wrought iron legs, handles, or decorative inlays, add a touch of industrial chic to rustic sofa tables. These metal elements not only enhance the table's visual appeal but also provide additional support and stability. Look for metal components with a durable powder-coated finish to prevent rust and corrosion. The strategic placement of metal accents can create a striking contrast with the wood, elevating the table's overall design.

**Adjustable Leveling Feet**

Uneven Floors can cause instability in furniture.To address this issue, many modern rustic sofa tables are equipped with adjustable leveling feet.These feet allow you to fine-tune the table's height and ensure it remains stable on any surface. Leveling feet are particularly useful in older homes where floors may not be perfectly even. Adjustable feet extend the life and functionality of your table.

Honestly a game-changer.

Here are 3 spots we checked out and *seriously* loved:

🥇 **KIDS CITY ADVENTURE** – Total indoor win. It’s like a mini city for toddlers — pretend gas stations, markets, dress-up spots. Our little one was obsessed.

🍨 **7Gradi Gelato** – Clean, cozy, and the perfect afternoon treat stop. Great seating and such a fun little break between activities.

🎨 **Honolulu Museum of Art School** – Low-key, creative space that gave us a breather midweek. Our toddler actually sat down and focused for a solid hour (which *never* happens lol).

I don’t know if anyone else feels this, but it's just so hard to find *good* activities for our kids these days. I’m so tired of scrolling through endless Google listings, trying to figure out if something is the right fit — and usually giving up halfway.

So I tried contacting Nestle (because they run Starbucks at Home) and they told me they were sorry and said to reach out to Starbucks for compensation. So I call the number Nestle gave me for Starbucks. They said that Walmart is responsible for the product because they bought it. 🙄 So I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. I was getting frustrated with the situation because no one (Nestle or Starbucks) was taking responsibility for a bad product. The supervisor said the same thing (Walmart is responsible 🙄) and I said, “No, no, no… you guys are the ones that made it. You’re the ones who put a rock in my coffee” and the customer “care” supervisor said, “oh yes, yes, yes” and she got all snappy with me and was super rude the rest of the phone call. She tried to force me off the phone before I was done talking and then I told her I did not appreciate the way she talked to me and she was very rude. Then she started using an obnoxious overly nice voice the rest of the call. I loved Starbucks. I loved working there. I loved their coffee. But THIS. This is not it.

1mkd2up,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforWaywards/comments/1mkd2up/any_advice_or_experience/,Any advice or experience?,"Hello.

 31 married 7 years to them 26 with a toddler together.  DDAY was 2 years ago. We have been trying R since. We’ve tried counseling but was not compatible with our counselor. Ever since we haven’t gone but tried to R by ourselves.

I admit. I was wrong. I cheated since beginning of our relationship. I used dating apps constantly and spoke to different people and shared images. I was looking for validation and I was selfish. I ended up meeting with 1  and nothing happened. I was not planning to make it a physical affair. It was a Spurr of the moment invite for some coffee.(not trying to justify. That’s what happened). I also hid our finances from them. Always made it seem okay. I lied to them constantly.

DDAY. They was devastated. I felt like disappearing. I’ve never wanted to end myself after seeing them so hurt. We had the white picket fence family image. Their world was destroyed that day.

Since DDAY I’ve deleted all my social media to make them feel better (per their request). I’ve dedicated my life to them. I’ve made sure that whatever they wants they  will have and I will abide by them. We’ve had our good and bad cycles. I’ve worked on myself because they wanted me to work on myself

They recently went away from work. They came home and I knew right away something was wrong. I confronted them. My world came crashing this time. They wants a divorce.

They said that since the trip they realized how toxic our relationship was and realized that they does not want this cycle to keep going. They said they felt empty whenever we’re together. They loves and cares for me but doesn’t have anymore romantic feelings.

We had another talk this morning and they said they hasn’t actually decided yet but willing to try therapy and wants to separate for now and have space.

I looking for advice or experience. I desperate. I scared. I know this is prolly how they felt during DDAY. Is there any chance we can salvage what’s left? I looking for a counselor that will see us asap in  hopes we can salvage this.

Thank you

1mkd1hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1mkd1hz/dirty_fasting_exercise_and_weight/,"Dirty Fasting, Exercise, and Weight","Hello,

I'm a noob to all of this and may not know all the terms so please bear with me as I stumble through my questions. 

I'm 36f (almost 37) starting weight 240lbs (108.86kg) ish current weight 236 ish, doing alternate day dirty fasting for about a month. My fasting days look kind of like this: in the morning I have a cup coffee with half and half. For lunch, I might have some fruit with skin (blueberries or apple), or a handful of peanuts, or sometimes just water. For dinner I will have a piece of meat like chicken, or a sugar free protein shake. I add sugar free electrolyte mixes to my water throughout the day because I'm a nursing mom and it helps with milk supply, and I sweat a lot at work. 

I am not exercising in the traditional sense, but M-F I am a custodian, averaging around 3 miles a day for steps, and doing lots of pushing, pulling, and lifting (especially with this summer cleaning). 

I can sadly only give approximations for my weight because I think I have a crappy floor. Or a very crappy set of scales. I thought the first scale was busted after years of use because my numbers fluctuated depending on where I moved it, so, I got a new scale. But now it seems it has the same problem. I think the estimates are pretty close for starting weight at least, given my most recent doctors office visit (back in March), where I was 244lbs with clothes and shoes. 

Anyway. I haven't noticed many changes except that my hunger levels and energy have improved substantially. I can't tell if I've lost weight. 

Based on this information...should I be worried at this stage? Do I need to just stay the course and find a better placement for my scale and see if I get more consistent results? Is there anything in my routine that should be changed (for example, is the handful of salted peanuts a terrible idea?).

Any advice for me in general? 

Be gentle, I am super new to this journey and I feel a little in over my head, especially with trying to nurse and raising a baby at the same time, but I'm doing my best.

It’s 5:42 PM here in Georgia — that awkward time of day where it’s too late for coffee but too early to crawl into bed… unless you’re over 35, in which case bed is always an option.

Just popping in to say hi and hope everybody had a solid day — or at least survived it with minimal chaos.

Here are a few stray thoughts floating around in my head:
	•	Why does 5pm feel like “middle of the day” in summer but “almost bedtime” in winter?
	•	I haven’t eaten dinner but I have eaten 3 snacks that could qualify as a charcuterie board if you squint.
	•	Is it still a to-do list if I keep moving everything to tomorrow? Asking for a friend.
	•	Also, how is it August already? I swear it was March like… five minutes ago.

Anyway, just checking in. If you’re winding down or still grinding, I see you. Drop your random thoughts too — I think this might be fun to do more often.

Feel free to go all cheesy and LinkedIn-esque, I need some inspiration!

I recently changed jobs, from going from a quite busy role with a million things on, but having my own office, to one with longer deadlines, lots of focus and slow, systematic work - in an open plan.

I really enjoy it, but I find it hard to stay in my one seat for much longer than 6 hours. By then, I’m just done!

I have identified that I need more mini breaks during the day, and I need to change scenery every now and then.  

My colleagues are lovely, but they also bury themselves in long, slow work. I’m used to the discretion of having an office (so I could just pop in to a friendly colleague for a quick banter) and more people around (so if I needed a break, there would always be somebody to chat with by the coffee machine).  Where I’m now, everybody just sits there in silence except for our 30 minute lunch break!

I have flexible hours, but I need to clock 8 hours every day. I really don’t want to work in the evenings, so I need my workday to happen between 8am-5pm. Except for a few weekly meetings, I am pretty much without supervision. But it’s kind of expected that we come into work at least 3-4 days/week.

I feel like I can’t work out how I can create a workday that’s not just boring. Do I work a bit from home? Well I could, only it reminds me of Covid, and my kids all come barging in one after the other… 

I could exercise before or during the workday, but there are no showers! 

Can anybody relate? Have you switched up your day somehow? Do you have any big or small routines, ideas or something to share? I just want to make the best out of a pretty good job, without going stir crazy in the office! ",1,1754602901.0,work,0,1.0,False

1mkcxeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1mkcxeo/nicotinefree_for_7_days/,Nicotine-free for 7 days!,"It may not seem like much, but it's a huge milestone for me. I'd been a smoker for 13 years. In the last 3-4 years or so, I smoked less but I vaped a lot more. Anyway, I was doing both - for example, when going out with friends I'd both smoke and vape. I'd always vape when taking a dump - essentially, the vape pen was always with me when home, except when I'd sleep.

One week ago I decided to stop cold turkey. Up until now, the longest I'd gone without smoking/vaping was 2-3 days (and that happened when I had a cold), but I'm feeling quite pumped right now, **because I genuinely want to quit**.

So really wanting to not be a smoker anymore helps me a lot whenever I get cravings. I have also not avoided any triggers - I do everything I was doing before (having a beer, coffee, going out and so on). I do not want to fear certain moments because of the fear that I may pick up smoking again.

I have almost got used to not smoking. Of course, my brain has been conditioned to think about a smoke whenever I have a drink, a cup of coffee or after having lunch. But it has become increasingly easier to ignore these thoughts.

It genuinely feels good to not feel like a slave anymore. So I guess this post is both to brag a little bit but also encourage others that, in my opinion, the key to quitting is to genuinely not want to be a smoker anymore. Each craving is an opportunity for us gain one more small victory and remind ourselves how addictive this shit is - but as long as you **want** to quit, I firmly believe anyone can do it.",10,1754602775.0,stopsmoking,1,1.0,False

1mkcutm,https://i.redd.it/7q8au5dd2ohf1.png,Fallout Manhattan gameplay recap: session 7,"Twenty's player unfortunately couldn't make it this week, which is a shame, but I know she'll be here for the next session. So for Alice, Connor, and Scrogg, this was the session I'd perhaps put the most preparation into. Let's dive in! 

The party starts off in Madison Square. While Alice is taking her time rousing from her sleep, Connor is in his room tending to the group's Strange and Interesting Plant^TM. Knowing the plant eats meat, Connor offers it a cooked ribeye steak. The plant sucks on the meat for a moment before spitting it back out and releasing a cloud of spores in defiance. Connor falls his Endurance check this time and winds up under the plant's influence. In this state, Connor gets the idea that the plant will only eat fresh meat. 

So this in mind, he heads downstairs to the tavern area of the Pressbox Bar and Grill. There, he asks the Mr. Handy server for some raw meat. The robot finds the request a bit odd, but sees no problem in fulfilling it. It sells Connor the meat, and he feeds it to the plant - satisfying its hunger. As the plant digests the meat, it gets even bigger, now starting to outgrow its Slocum's Joe coffee can. A bit worried about this, Connor asks where he can get a new pot for the plant, to which the Mr. Handy suggests checking out the local general store.

Meanwhile, Scrogg is out taking Dogmeat for a walk when he's approached by one of Madison Square's law keeping Triggermen. The man demands that Scrogg gather his friends to come with him. Scrogg refuses to cooperate though, and in response, the Triggerman trains his gun on the Super Mutant, clarifying that it wasn't a request. Unimpressed, Scrogg turns his back and begins to walk away. At this, the Triggerman fires a warning shot into the air and is soon joined by a handful of other Triggermen. At this, Scrogg reluctantly agrees and returns to the Pressbox to gather his party.

Already on his way out, Connor joins immediately. Then in order to wake Alice, Scrogg makes a ruckus beating on the side of the building. This does work though, and Alice soon joins up with her companions. 

They're led by the Triggerman back to Madison Square's jail - which has been jury rigged out of the old arena's locker rooms. There, he takes them to a cell at the end where they find a young woman sitting with her back to the bars. Once there, he tells her they're all hers and walks off. 

This young woman introduces herself as Fiona and tells them that she'd like to join the party. According to her, the only reason she hasn't had any luck making her way through the Wasteland was that she never had a party of her own. It's for that reason that she asked the Triggermen to summon the party for her.

Of course, Connor sees through her and asks if she needs the party to pay her bail. She admits that she does, so they go to talk to the Triggerman. He informs the party that Fiona is in custody for pickpocketing. But since she didn't put up resistance when arrested, she was taken to jail instead of gunned down in the street. He then goes on to say her bail will cost them a measley 50 Caps, which Connor happily pays.

With that, Fiona joins the party as Connor's companion. 

The party now sets out for the Madcap Toys Factory, following the lead of Richard M. Downe. On the way, they stumble across an old theater that's been recently refurbished. On the marquee are the words, ""Atticus Connery's Theatre for the Performing Artse"". They decide to investigate, and inside they find a man directing a group of Raiders through a Shakespearean rehearsal. This man - Connery - has somehow captured a group of Raiders and equipped them with shock collars that he can control remotely. The idea being that he'll teach them to be cultured and perform the works of the Bard. And if they don't, he simply uses his collars to electrocute them to death. 

Finding themselves in an interesting moral situation, the party takes a moment to decide what to do. On the one hand, they hate raiders. On the other, slavery. Finally, they come to a decision - they'll steal Connery's remote, empower the Raiders to overthrow him, and then use the remote themselves to kill all the Raiders.

So with Scrogg literally taking the stage to loudly and poorly perform Frank Sinatra covers, Fiona gains the opportunity to sneak up behind Connery and steal his remote. When Connor calls for them to rise up against their captor, they ask if he's going to disable the collars. Scrogg - of course somehow being the Party's face with the ""silver tongue"" - convinces the Raiders that they fully intend to. 

Thoroughly convinced, the Raiders attack and soon overpower Connery, soon even going so far as to literally tear him apart. Deciding she's seen enough, Alice activates the collars and eliminates the Raiders. Wasting no time, Alice then sets to collecting fingers from all the bodies.

New companion Fiona is understandably shocked at this behavior, and Connor explaining to her that it's for a flesh-eating plant really doesn't help matters. But given that she's the one that begged to be with the party, Fiona decides to just go with it. Meanwhile, Alice takes a few fresh fingers and offers them to the plant as a treat. Then seeing the plant is getting too big for its pot, Alice cuts slits in the sides for its roots to push through. I think it's also now that she decides to name the plant Frank.

The theater cleared out of all its occupants, our party moves on from there to the toy factory. Once inside, they find themselves in the lobby area and engaged with a trio of Protectrons (all made up like US soldier action figures). After taking them out, Connor looks down the hall to the right to find a lift. He presses the button from the side, and the lift moves to the floor below without him. After summoning it back, he returns to the lobby's main area. There he finds a pair of electronic pads on the floor. He notices one of them is marked with a 1 and not lit up. The other, marked with a 2, is one Alice crawled over in combat and is now lit up with a ring of green LEDs.

Connor then moves into the adjoining room, where he finds a terminal on a desk. Hacking into the terminal, he learns that it's simply the factory employees' time punch terminal. Electing not to clock in or out with it, he leads the party down the lift.

This takes them to the Product Testing department. After moving down a long hallway (and defeating a Mr. Handy made up to look like an octopus), they emerge into a large room with a tower of enormous ""wooden"" blocks in the middle. There's also of course a handful of toy-themed robots in the room (one of which being an Assaultron made up to look like Nuka-Girl).

During the fight, Connor tests his new Robotics Expert Perk by hacking into the Assaultron and shutting it down. He then later also hacks into a Protectron and forces it to self destruct. Although he tries to move out of the way at the end of his turn, the Protectron simply moves up beside him once again before detonating. 

Connor was entirely able to brush this off.

Now exploring the room, Connor finds some scrap in some storage boxes, as well as a side room with another electronic pad inside - this one marked with a 5.

While Connor's looking around, Scrogg finds a window that looks in on a break room. Upset that he can see through a wall that he can't also walk through, Scrogg breaks the glass and moves inside. Inside is a small table, a counter area, and an arcade game. 

Connor joins his ally and activates the pad inside. The ring of green LEDs light up and then begin spinning around - indicating a connection has been established. To this, he essentially says ""Huh, neat,"" and then moves on. The two move back into the testing department main room, and Scrogg finds another window into a room that has a raised platform inside. Meanwhile, Connor finds a path and follows it.

Encouraged by his previous window encounter, Scrogg smashes through this one as well, finding on the other side a series of numbered buttons on this raised platform... And Connor. Turns out there was a perfectly accessible path into the room this whole time! But whatever, I'm sure Scrogg smashing through windows won't become some kind of obnoxious running theme. 🙃

The party convenes in this room and quickly realizes they need to press the numbered buttons in order. So with a bit of teamwork, they are handily able to complete the puzzle and open a secret panel in the wall. There, they find a Skill Magazine for the Science Skill. Connor happily claims this prize (as if he needs it lol).

From here, the group continues into the R&D department. Here they don't find a fight, but they do find a room with a lever inside... On the other side of a window. I'll give you three guesses what Scrogg does. 

As soon as he crosses through the window frame, Scrogg pulls the lever inside and realizes there's a *PERFECTLY ACCESSIBLE ENTRANCE TO THE SMALL ROOM DIRECTLY NEARBY.*

In any case, the party continues across the R&D department and drops onto a raised platform inside the factory's lowest level - Production. On the platform with them is a small shack and a button. While the shack door is locked, Connor finds that pressing the button unlocks it. Inside is another lever, and once Connor pulls it, he hears the factory roar to life. This also summons a group of robots to attack the party.

The fight with the robots is a difficult one, but the party is eventually able to defeat or otherwise deactivate them all, gaining in the process an additional pair of Assaultron Parts to bring back to Richard Downe.

Nagwork from home kami nung pandemic and I rented an apartment sa bayan since ung bahay namin ay nasa bukid at hindi pa naa-access ng mga internet companies. I listed some creepy encounter I experienced in this apartment.

**1. BISITA**

If I can still remember it right, my shifts starts at 10PM. Madalas ay gising na ako ng 5PM para magasikaso. Mahilig din ako magsulat ng wattpad stories bago magstart ung shift ko using my personal PC. So eto na nga, nagchat sakin ung pinsan ko na dadayo daw sila ng kape sa apartment, sabi ko go lang. Sobrang busy ko nun magwattpad dko na namalayan na dumating na pala sila. Anyways, may kutson nga pala ako na pirming nakalatag sa sahig, sa tabi ng pinto. Bale ung work pc at personal pc ko ay katabi lang nung higaan ko. Narinig ko ang mga pinsan ko na nagkakaingay na at sinabihan ko sila na magtimpla na ng kape sa kusina at may stock naman ako. Lumingon din ako and I saw a moreno chubby guy with curly hair sitting at the end of my bed looking at me with a little smile. Tinanguan ko lang sya and look back at my pc and decided to stop on what I'm doing. After saving my drafts, sakto na pumasok ang pinsan ko sa kwarto ko holding two mugs of coffee. Kasunod din nya si YanYan at Faith na may hawak din na mug ng kape. Sabi ko naman, ""Hindi nyo ako idinamay sa kape?"" sagot naman ng pinsan ko, ""sayo nga etong isa gaga!"" Nagtaka naman ako kaya napasabi ako na ""hindi nyo aalukin ng kape yung kasama nyo?"" Nagkatinginan naman sila. So ako naman, lumaba ng kwarto para hanapin ung bisita nila (madalas kasi sila magsama ng tropa nila kahit dko kilala) then sabi ng pinsan ko, ""wala naman kaming kasama."" kinilabutan ako gagi kaya sabi ko ""eh sino ung lalaking nakaupo kanina sa kutson ko nung pumasok kayo, ngumiti pa nga sa akin eh!"" shuta talaga pag naaalala ko yun kinikilabutan talaga ako.



**2. KATOK**

Eto talaga super unforgettable kasi november 1 ito nangyari. May friend ako na dun din umupa, sa third floor nga lang sya. Madalas din sya magpuyat dahil naglalaro sya ng MIR4 til morning. So around 2am nakarinig ako sa taas ng parang nagpupukpok or katok (malakas talaga sya to the point na naririnig ko sa second floor) so ayun nagchat ako sa kanya with pabiro pa ""ano naman pinupukpok mo dyan, may calls ako nakakadistract ka."" Nagreply naman sya na hindi naman daw sya nag-iingay dun at wala daw syang naririnig na katok or pukpok. Mejo naghinala na ako dun pero di muna ako nagsabi sa kanya. Tumahimik din naman ung ingay sa taas then after ilang minutes kumatok ulit sa taas so I messaged him again. Hindi nya agad ako nireplyan tapos tumahimik na naman. Naging tahimik naman for almost 30 mins ata then that's the time he messaged me na. He told me na he's about to send me a video proof that he's not making any noise and he even minimizes the volume of his pc but when he started video recording, may black silhouette or something daw ang dumaan sa camera nya. Kaya hindi daw sya agad nakareply. At the same time biglang may kumatok na naman, pero this time sa pinto ko na, NapaWTF talaga ako pero dahil sanay naman ako sa ganun, sumigaw lang ako ng ""ay t\*ngina wag dito! nagtatrabaho ako!"" then nawala ung katok sa pinto ko. Pero pakshet segundo lang may katok ulit sa third floor and nagmessage ulit ako sa tropa na naroon na naman sa tas ung ingay. Natatakot na daw sya at iba na din daw pakiramdam nya sa loob ng apartment. I told him to sprinkle salt around his unit and windows. Dun lang nawala ung kilabot nya. Anyways hindi na nag-ingay ang kung ano mang bagay na iyon. Mind you, private property ung inuupahan namin at laging pinapadlock ung gate pag 10pm na, and that time kami lang dalawa ang umuupa sa building na yun, After that incident. lumipat sya sa bakanteng unit sa tabi ko kahit mas maliit iyon sa inuupahan nya sa third floor, natakot talaga siguro si friend haha.



**3. MINOR PARAMDAM**

Wala naman ibang malalang paramdam kasi natuto na ako maglagay ng protection sa apartment ko. Saka siguro dahil dedma lang ako sa ganun eh hindi na sila ginaganahan manakot sa akin haha. But may moments na ipinapaalam pa din nila ung presence nila. Like pag may trabaho ako, I always have a small mirror in front of me then may makikita na lang ako na blurred whitish na dumadaan sa likuran ko. May alaga din akong mga pusa and minsan ung male siamese ko mauupo sa tabi ko while staring intently sa sulok g kisame. Like TF kahit kalugin ko ung lagayan ng treats nila or tawagin ko sya, hindi nya inaalis ung tingin nya sa lugar na iyon kahit wala namang insekto or kung ano dun. They always sleep beside me kahit may cage at bed sila. One time, I went out and I saw the old caretaker of that building and he suddenly asked me ""hindi ba nagpaparamdam sayo ung nakatira dyan?"" ngumiti na lang ako saka sumagot na ""minsan lang po pero sanay na naman ako.""Super dami ko pang creepy experience from past.

1mkchg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1mkchg4/going_back_to_undergrad_after_receiving_a_bfa/,Going back to undergrad after receiving a BFA,"Hi, I was hoping for some advice and personal stories that might help me decide the best course of action for my education and life.

After having a very rough time in high school, with mistreated mental illness and addiction, I rebelled against the academic system and put my whole heart into pursuing an art degree. I absolutely loved it and don't regret it for a second; I learned a ton about myself and grew as a person. I take my art very seriously and work on it every day, thinking about it constantly, and always changing and growing. I'm proud to have received my BFA. It took me a long time to get to this point, but it took even longer for me to realize I don't want to pursue a career in art. It's painful for me to sell my work, plus the idea of taking up a ""day job"" to support myself while I market my work just doesn't feel like me. I also keep finding myself in social circles that feel frivolous and selfish and I'm starting to feel trapped. I've looked into graduate programs in museum studies or art conservation, but I just feel like I don't really care about that; I never read about these subjects in my spare time. Over the past couple years, I've been floating the idea of returning to undergrad in a scientific field. I really want my career to contribute to the world differently than art: more directly, more overtly. Something to make me feel like I'm really helping lives. There's a university near me that has an accomplished Forensic Science program--something I've always been fascinated with--that I'm considering applying to.

In terms of direct questions, I was wondering other's experiences with getting a second undergraduate degree in a completely different field. I have perused many queries on here about the subject, but none specifically reference turning away from the very different world of art school. Many people have suggested getting an advanced degree and pushing oneself to take the intro classes as quick as possible, but since I studied art, I fear I would be vastly behind everyone else. Especially because it's been such a long time since I was in high school.

It's troubling, isn't it, the idea of spending money on college twice. I was also so determined to be one of the few artists who would ""make it"" while in school. It feels like I'm giving up in a way, to pivot like this. But I've somewhat set my mind on it (depending on if input says this is a terrible idea). It's also frustrating because I know my art is good. Really good. But it's not like having a fulfilling scientific career will eliminate all my spare time for art--will it? Who here considers themselves an artist despite having another career? In order to keep myself monetarily afloat, it seems I'll have to have a job in addition to my art anyway, and I'd prefer it be something I love rather than, say, making coffee or selling shoes.

Also, what exactly is the best process to reapply to undergrad? Obviously I would transfer my gen-ed requirements, but does that mean I apply as a transfer student? Should I start by auditing classes as a non-student and then roll into the degree? Will I need to retake the SAT and ACT as an adult? Who best should write letters of recommendation? It also slightly complicates matters that I have a court-sealed name change so everything in high school may not be able to be linked to my identity; however I think my high school records are so long ago (I graduated 6 years ago) they may not even mean anything.

I'd love to hear from anyone in the same boat as me, or who knows anyone who was! Or even just similar situations. And don't hesitate away from specificity, I'm very interested. Thanks!",1,1754601722.0,education,0,1.0,False

1mkcfq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1mkcfq9/bachelorette_party_cost/,Bachelorette Party Cost,"This is both a rant and a question. How much would you be willing to spend on a bachelorette party?

I’m planning two — my own, and one for my friend (I’m the MoH).

Mine is going to be out of town. We’re all financially well-off: four of us are in our late 30s, two are in our early 30s, I’m 29, and another is 25. It’s going to be a girls’ weekend. We're looking at $500–600 (before anyone yells at me and says this is insane, I promise everyone is on board). It’s been easy to narrow down activities we’d like to do. It’s months away, but we already have a mini itinerary. The only minor disagreement I’ve had is over how much I’m contributing — meaning my own share of everything. Because I’m planning a weekend trip, I’m not going to make people spend $100–150 more just to cover my share. I only mention all this because that trip has been SO easy to plan.

Now... for my friend’s.

This one is (sort of) local. The bride loves activities: birthday weekend trips, outdoorsy stuff, amusement parks, crafts, day trips to big cities — that kind of thing. I sent out a little questionnaire to everyone she invited, asking for suggestions, availability, how much they want to spend, etc.

Most people said they’d like a 1–2 night thing and were comfortable spending around $200. I told them the bride's idea was Chicago. They all agreed Chicago would be great. But after all the questionnaires were in, I had to tell them: we can't do a weekend in Chicago on a $200 budget.

I’m not upset about the lower budget — I get it! I suggested everything the bride wanted, and adjusted plans based on what people could actually do.

So we planned something in another nearby city — a little touristy, but much cheaper. People could skip spending the night since it’s only 30 minutes away. I asked if we’d rather do more activities during the day instead of staying overnight. A lot of people said they’d like to stay (8 of 11, I believe), but they wanted an Airbnb within walking distance of everything. Okay, fair enough. I reached out to everyone who wanted to stay and asked what they were comfortable spending on the Airbnb so I could budget for lodging and activities.

I booked a place within budget and started planning the rest.

Fast forward a few months — I reach out again about activity ideas and prices. I picked a few activities and restaurants, shared general pricing, and waited to see what the majority preferred. Then... four people said, “Hey, I don’t think I’m going to stay overnight anymore.”

This jumped the Airbnb cost from $89 per person to $160.

I reached out to the remaining overnight folks and we decided to switch to a different Airbnb. At this point, pickings were slim for anything cheap and close, but I found a place and got it back under $100 per person.

Then I started planning the day:

-Breakfast 
-kayaking ($20ish)
-Lunch
-Paint & sip ($73ish)
-Dinner at the Airbnb
-Night out or games


I knew the $73 paint thing would be a bit of an issue, but some people wouldn’t be into the outdoorsy stuff, and this was the one crafty thing the bride really wanted (put of about 4 activities. She's been trying to get me to go to this place for months). I also knew food would be an added cost, so I was going to suggest coffee, then a potluck picnic lunch (it's near the beach), and a cheap dinner like pizza at the Airbnb.

Then…the person with the highest stated budget said they’re going to skip kayaking because “it’s getting too expensive and she needs to watch her budget""

So now we’re down to:
-4–5 people not staying overnight (for a total of 4 of us and the bride staying) 
-4 people not doing the morning activity
-Waiting to hear from 5 others on the morning activity
-Waiting on 3 for the afternoon activity
-1 person dropped out completely due to stupid drama. 

NOTHING is confirmed. It's a month away.
The bride doesn’t know that half the group is backing out of stuff, and she is going to be upset. Not in a bratty way — she just really values attention (not in a bad way!) and will feel disappointed. Which then makes me feel bad.

I really tried. I tried to be as accommodating as possible. I tried to offer a range of activities and prices. I feel like an ass for planning something “expensive,” even though I was constantly trying to balance people’s budgets and what the bride wanted.

I even tried to suggest something super local — our city isn’t really a tourist destination, so it would have been way cheaper — but no one was on board.


So now that my rant is done… How much money would you put into a bachelorette trip? Have you ever planned a Bach party, and how'd that go for you?

We don’t have a website.
No social media presence.
No highway billboards saying “Visit Beautiful Flintridge!” with pictures of waterfalls or smiling families.

If you ever do find yourself here, it’s because something brought you.
Something pulled you.

I was born here.
And I’ve tried to leave more times than I can count.

I always come back.
Sometimes I wake up in my bed without even knowing how.

But this isn’t about me.

It’s about what happens when the sun goes down.



I was sixteen when I first saw it happen.

At the time, there were whispers always whispers but nothing you could point to. Just things the older folks muttered at church, or the librarian slipped between sentences like they didn’t mean anything.

Things like:

“Never walk home after dark.”

“Always check the windows are locked before 9.”

“Don’t answer if someone knocks after midnight.”

The first rule they teach you as a kid?

Don’t go outside after sunset. Ever.

But I was sixteen.
And I was in love.

Her name was Marnie.
She was new.
Moved here with her mom after what she called a “bad year,” but she never told me more than that. She was sharp-eyed and wild in the way city girls are when they first move to the country. She said this place felt fake. Too quiet.

We used to sneak out to the old train tracks. She’d bring her dad’s cigarettes and a Polaroid camera, and we’d talk about music and death and dreams and pretend we weren’t trapped.

That night, we lost track of time.

The sky went orange…
Then pink…
Then dark.

I didn’t notice until she said, “What time is it?”

I looked at my phone.

8:52.

My stomach dropped.

We ran.

We were only five blocks from her house — maybe three minutes if we sprinted. But the second we turned the corner onto Sycamore Street, I felt it.

The air changed.
Thicker.
Quieter.

Like the world had swallowed its breath.

The street was empty.
No headlights.
No porch lights.

Just us.
And the dark.

Marnie whispered, “Something’s wrong.”
I didn’t answer.

Because I saw something.

Something standing at the end of the street.

Not someone.
Something.

It was tall easily over eight feet.
Thin.
Its arms hung low, past its knees.
Its head was crooked.
Like its neck had too many joints.

And it was watching us.
By some reason the name ”Peter” came to mind while watching it.

We ran again.
Harder.
Faster.
Marnie was in front. I remember that detail because I saw it lunge from the side street.

I never even heard it.

One second she was running.

The next?

She was gone.

Like she was plucked from the air.

No scream.
No sound.
Just… nothing.


I didn’t stop.
I don’t even remember running all the way home.
I just remember slamming the front door, locking every bolt, and sinking to the kitchen floor while my mother stood frozen at the sink.

Her first words?

Not “What happened?”
Not “Where’s Marnie?”

She just said:

“You were lucky. Peter often goes for girls first.”

I asked what she meant by that, and where ”Peter” had taken Marnie and she just said

”Their getting married”


Marnie was never found.
No search parties.
No missing posters.

Her mother claimed she ran away.
The cops didn’t even file a report.

I asked her mom once weeks later what she really thought.
She just looked at me and said:

“You weren’t supposed to see that.”
“They don’t like being seen.”



After that night, things changed.
I started noticing patterns.

For example:
Every month, on the 13th, someone new would disappear.
Always at night.
Always quietly.

Sometimes it was a kid.
Sometimes a teacher.
Once, the mayor.

Never any bodies.
No blood.
Just gone.

We don’t have a cemetery in Flintridge.
Never needed one.

The dead don’t stay.
The missing don’t return.



I confronted my dad once.
He was drunk slurring, angry, emotional.
Perfect timing.

I asked, “Why don’t people leave this place?”

He stared at me a long time.
Then said:

“Because it follows.”
“You can’t run from something that lives in silence.”

When I pressed him further, he told me about a town meeting he went to in the ‘80s. Said it wasn’t a real meeting not the kind with minutes and coffee.

It was a deal.

A negotiation.

The townspeople had been desperate. Children were vanishing. People were losing their minds. And one night, the lights in the entire town blinked out for exactly seven seconds.

When they came back on, there was a figure in the center of the town square.

No face.
No voice.
Just a tall shape in black, standing so still it looked like part of the statue.

My father said everyone heard the same message not aloud, but inside:

“Give me what you can spare, and I will let the rest stay.”

Ever since then, the rules were followed.
The disappearances were accepted.
No police.
No outsiders.

Just tribute.


I’ve tried leaving three times.

The first time, my car broke down twenty miles out. I woke up the next morning in my bed.

The second time, I made it all the way to a motel two towns over. That night, I dreamed of Marnie. She was standing in my hallway, mouthing something I couldn’t hear.

I woke up back home.
Nose bleeding.
Door locked from the inside.

The third time, I didn’t even try. I just packed a bag and walked.

I got as far as the edge of the forest before I heard it.

A knock.
Three of them.
On a tree.

When I turned, it was there.

Watching.

It had no eyes.
But I felt it staring.

I dropped the bag and walked home.



I don’t know why I’m writing this.
No one will believe me.
You’ll think this is just another creepy story on the internet.

But if you’re reading this and you find yourself passing through a small town with no streetlights, no billboards, and houses with curtains drawn tight even during the day, please find me! I wanna get out of here

But if night time arrives while your here, either fall asleep or run.

Because Flintridge isn’t a town.
It’s a trap.
A mouth waiting to close.

And once night falls…

I am still so sad
I am still so angry.
Angry at the world.
Angry at her doctors.
Sometimes I'm angry at her for leaving me so early (she didn'teven make it to 50). And then I feel sad and guilty about feeling angry.

I'm 26, I'm in school to become an assistant nurse and I have a small child who is her only grandchild. He will turn 5 in November and she never got to meet him. She never got to hold him. We never really had the money to visit until it was almost the end, and then we only had money for me to go and say goodbye. I don't have any pictures of my mum and my son together.

What I have left of her is a necklace, a bracelet (it's broken), a sweater and her coffee/tea mug.

I wear her sweater sparingly during the cold months as it's got some holes I can't fix.

Anytime I have an important event, like a job interview or a test at school, I wear her necklace to keep her close.

Every morning I have my coffee in her cup.

I talk to her sometimes. I believe she is with me.

But I miss her so much. It hurts.
And I just wish she could hug me and stroke my hair and tell me everything will work out in the end.

I asked a young 25 year old friend while travelling in train Packed with Passengers rubbing shoulders, 

“Why did you get married"", and the young man said, “To have fun"". And even though i did not intend to be rude, a great laughter escaped me. People on around me too began to laugh. All the men and women held their stomachs and smiled wryly.

In my Younger days of during my Masters, I was gossiping with few female friends huddled over lukewarm coffee, randomly, that's how most discussions start in gossips, asked the 30 year old friend why she wanted to get married in the first place,

She uttered the most vanilla response of Partnership, growth and Sharing life etc etc,  

This was beautiful but hollow, a pre-recorded statement, The Most Acceptable of Answers, We did not pursue this further because another random topic came up but these gossip almost force you to one up the previous tea so I, the fool, the unsecured server, uttered a piece of high-grade intelligence: a certain girl harbored feelings for a boy, A conventionally attractive at that,

Just the next day, This ""Partnership and Growth"" friend, of for sake for some 3.5 seconds of attention from the conventionally attractive boy revealed the talk while pointing her finger at me that i told her all this,

This was a lesson i could never seem to learn that People are Twats, utter twats who should be judged through their actions, definitely not words,

Notice How she did not mention social economic security or good old plain attractiveness in her answer?

You could Ask me what do i look for in a partners? Even i would spout some Form of Growth/Partnership/Meaning answer without mentioning even the hint of big tits and small waist with 0.8 shoulder to waist ratio.

that was intentional and conscious because aim is to appease, to Speak well respected half truths, Did it matter that this women was a lazy human in general who had wasted her years doing jackshit, used to leech off others for mere assignments, tried to take advantage of general kindness of others?

Nah, Because It's a Sin to utter that People are Twats despite knowing it and almost everybody having experienced it,

So People Are twats, in different ways but twats still.

See what they Do and act out to judge them.

Then I labeled each photo container with a column.

I love it for a couple of reasons. First of all the things hold floss in any form. I’ve got skiens, bobbins, and baggies. It’s rad to just throw things in there as they are. Second, the column sorting is wonderful for finding colors or groups of colors when I’m changing something up.

I also printed this on two pages, it makes it easy to pull a box with the general color scheme I want.

I cry about it sometimes, and honestly, I end up feeling sorry for myself. But I don’t want to do that anymore. I know I deserve good things, and I’m a caring, nice person.

*I was following a caribou trail along the Teklanika, herd had passed through days ago but I sought no better cure for my boredom.* 

*The camp stuck out like a wound upon the land. A rotted set of tent poles, bivouac long since collapsed, a rusted pot. It had almost been consumed by the marsh. The trees leaned in like children listening for a story that would never come. I felt out of place, as if I had stepped into the cemetery of a forlorn town.* 

*My eyes barely caught it.*

*Sitting on a lichen-crusted rock.*

*A book. With a wooden token sitting next to it.*

*These looked almost new, the book stamped with an old HBC logo looked to have just been laid there yesterday. The token scared me. It was a face, eyes open, tongue out. A ward, like the old stories.*

*I have read this book. I believe its words. The forest feels like its closing in. Night came too fast.* 

*I’m posting this here in case the wind finds me, too.*

**Journal of Baptiste M.**

**Yukon River, Western AlaskaWinter, 1904**

I don't know if anyone will ever read this. Maybe the snow’ll swallow it, maybe the wind’ll scatter the pages. Or maybe whatever’s out there now, wearing Charlie’s skin like a damp coat, will find it first. But I need to write. Put something between me and the silence. Make a record, for whoever comes after—if anyone does.

My name is Baptiste. Born in Buffalo Narrows, Saskatchewan. My maman was Métis—Cree blood, strong and soft-spoken. My père was French and loud, but never mean. He taught me to trap, hunt, live close to the land. I grew up skinning muskrats with a pocketknife and listening to fiddle tunes by candlelight. I was a child of the prairie, floating through life like logs on the Qu'Appelle river. I left home when I was seventeen, drifted north like smoke from a cabin chimney. I thought I was chasing gold. Maybe I was just chasing quiet.

I came to Alaska by raft, sled, and frozen boot-leather. Bummed rides from trappers, gold panners, ex-confederates looking to escape the long arm of Uncle Sam. I once met a missionary fella, small man, going to proselytize among the peoples of the great heathen North. Traveled the Yukon until the world narrowed to cold air, pine smoke, and the smell of my own wool coat. I liked it that way. No one cared who I was up there. I was just another lost soul hoping to find, or lose, himself under that big white Alaskan sun. Ended up in Eagle late in the season, the only beacon of civilization, if you can even call it that, for miles until that trading settlement up on the Tanana. It was already cold, snow crusting the edges of the trail, dogs breathing steam like little engines. The kind of cold that bites your teeth and settles into your bones like regret. 

I was raised Catholic, like most Métis. I was proud of my God, but the further I came north it seemed he mattered less and less. Eagle was no exception. A small cluster of cabins with a single dirt trail through the center. As I walked into town, passing a few straggling natives hauling tump-lines of pelts to the factor’s house, I saw it. Burned remnants, a single blackened cross the only betrayal of what this charred hulk once was. I turned to a man walking past, an old man, scars on his face and hair poking out from under what looked to be an old army cap. I tried, in French, to ask him why the few inhabitants hadn’t rebuilt God's house. He stared at me like I was from a different world. Then he simply said, “Dieu n’a pas de demeure ici.” God has no home here. 

I was in the post office-slash-supply store—rough-cut logs, frost etching patterns on the windows, woodstove in the corner throwing off more smoke than heat. A tattered flag adorned the wall behind the counter; whether taken as a trophy or displayed out of actual reverence, I couldn’t tell. The few patrons huddled near the woodstove, speaking in a mix of French, Russian, and a multitude of other languages that I couldn’t pinpoint. I sat in the back, nursing a split knuckle from a mishap with the axe and drinking thick coffee that tasted like charred rope. In strode this Gwich’in man. Big shoulders, sharp eyes. Dressed in a caribou hide parka that looked like it had been made by a blind seamstress. His hair was short and black, I couldn’t tell his age. He could’ve been 40, or he could’ve just seen his 19th winter.

He looked around once, eyes flashing to the fire, then to the people conversing like ravens on a carcass. Looked at me. Then walked over and sat across from me like it’d already been decided somewhere upriver.

He didn’t say anything. Just reached out, tapped the knuckles of my bandaged hand, then tapped his chest twice. I figured that meant his name. I said “Baptiste.” He nodded once, just once, like he was filing it away in some drawer in his head. He tapped his chest again. I shrugged. “Charlie,” I said. Figured he needed a name I could pronounce. He never told me different.

After a few more swigs of coffee, Charlie simply stood up and walked out. I assumed I should follow him, follow this man whose face looked like rawhide stretched over stone. He led me out back, past the store's wood supply and to what looked to be a pile of gear under a caribou hide. He looked at me, and his eyes glinted with what I could only assume was pride. It was really the only emotion I could glean from his straight-across grin. He pulled back the hide to reveal a set of snares, a tent with a HBC brand, and a pair of snowshoes. 

I looked at him, wondered what he had done to come into such a fortune. “Where did you get this?” I quizzed him. He only looked at me, eyes hinting at something that I couldn’t see. 

We left Eagle two days later, with the last barge gone and the snow piling deeper.  Headed upriver with two rifles, enough provisions to last a few weeks, and a general enthusiasm for the grand possibility. The sun beat on our backs as we walked, shadows trudging along under us, our only companions except the cold. The cold was constant. The cold was hungry. It was the kind of cold where trees groan in the night and the river talks in its sleep.

We built our camp on a bend in the Yukon where the spruce trees leaned like old men. Good hunting ground. Quiet. Nobody for miles but the ravens. 

Life was good, at first. We worked in rhythm. Wake up to frost on the blankets, breath like smoke in the cold. One of us would stoke the fire while the other boiled snow for water. Breakfast was usually pemmican or bannock, sometimes fresh rabbit or ptarmigan if we were lucky. Charlie made tea with spruce needles. Tasted like biting a tree, but it kept you sharp.

Charlie was certainly curious; multiple times I caught him opening my bible, staring at the lines of ink, which I knew meant less than moose tracks through the snow to him. But nevertheless, he looked, studied it with the same glint in his eyes as when we first met. 

We trapped in a wide loop down by the oxbow, mostly for fox and hare. Once we caught a lynx, and Charlie let out the first laugh I ever heard from him—a low, surprised sound like he hadn’t remembered he could. I smoked the meat, stretched the pelt. We talked without talking. Gestures. Shared chores. Some days we didn’t speak at all, but it never felt quiet.

The forest was quiet, but not dead. The trees were alive, they groaned and swayed like old women. Tracks of small animals crisscrossed the snow every morning. One morning, I awoke to find a set of wolverine tracks that came right to our tent, then retreated back into the snowy wild. 

I’d spend afternoons sharpening my knife with the whetstone my grandfather gave me. Charlie would whittle, dozens of small wooden men began to populate our camp. He would leave them all around, in a rough semicircle around our camp, always facing north. We kept the fire going all day long once the cold settled in—colder than anything I’d known back in Saskatchewan. Even the river sounded different. Groaned and popped like it was alive beneath the ice.

Saw bear tracks once, big ones. Fresh. Too fresh. Charlie squatted down and stared at them a long time. When I asked if it was a grizzly, he just shook his head once, real slow. Didn’t say more.

One morning a moose wandered near the camp, steam rising from its back like smoke from a sweat lodge. We both froze, watching. Charlie raised his rifle and brought it down with one shot to the neck. It kicked twice before it lay still in the snow. Clean. Beautiful. Charlie cut a set of birch poles at the kill site, then lashed them into a travois before he began splitting its belly and peeling its skin back. I helped, the skin ripping away from the flesh like the bark off a birch tree. We chopped the carcass into quarters, leaving the gut pile for the wolves and ravens. We hauled it in together, sweating through our coats. Took all day to cut it proper, hang the meat over a low fire, which creaked and popped like the joints of an old man. We thanked the spirit, me in my tongue, him in his. That night we ate like kings, fat sizzling on the fire, grease running down our chins, hands raw from the cold and the knives. 

Sometimes, after supper, we’d sit by the fire and watch the northern lights. They danced across the sky like stories, like ancestors telling secrets. Charlie’d hum low under his breath—something old, something I didn’t know but felt in my bones. I liked those nights. Felt like we were part of something older than the trees.

I started to remember the old stories. The stories I listened to from the loft where my brothers and I slept. Stories told away from the prying ears of the priests and the white men. Stories of the ancestors, the people who brought our people out from the dawnland and fought the old Buffalo-beings. I started to see that here, the Catholic God had no power. I began to pray to something older, something more… natural. This was older than Jesus, Mother Mary, or any of that. 

But then the snow came heavier. Days got shorter. The forest got quieter.

And Charlie started watching the trees too much.

Then, one morning, he didn’t come back.

I figured he’d gone farther than usual, past our unspoken perimeter about four miles out from camp. Maybe tracked something, maybe he saw a bear or wolverine and decided to follow. I waited. Drank half a mug of coffee and left his mug sitting on a flat rock near the fire, steam curling up and vanishing in the cold air. By dusk, the cup was frozen solid. I decided to put on my snowshoes and follow his track through the snow. I followed as far as I could. It simply went straight through the trees, walking with purpose, almost as if he was following something out there. But the snow had started falling by then, slow at first, then harder, until the trail vanished under the storm. 

And the storm didn’t stop. Not that night. Not the next. It screamed.

The wind howled like a dying thing. The trees shook so hard it felt like the earth might snap open and swallow us whole. I burned half our firewood just trying to keep my fingers alive. I ate every last scrap of food that we had. The tent groaned under the weight of snow, and I had to go out multiple times, wrapped in hides and blankets to shovel snow off of it with my snowshoes. I barely slept—just sat up with the rifle across my lap, staring at the shadows like they might blink first.

I kept thinking I heard him. Crunch of snow, a voice in the wind, maybe a knock on the edge of the tent pole. Every time I’d throw open the flap, there’d be nothing but darkness and snow.

Then he came back. Two days later, just after dusk. The snow had just stopped falling, the wind blustering like the death throes of a dying buffalo bull. 

No sound. No warning. Just walked into camp like he’d never left. He was covered in snow but not cold, not shivering. I saw a glimpse of his hand, black with frostbite, before he quickly shoved it into a fold in his coat.  His coat was ripped along the arm, blood crusted along the edge like old rust. He looked at me like he didn’t recognize me—or maybe like I was the one who’d changed.

I said his name. “Charlie.”

He didn’t speak. Didn’t blink. Just stared. His eyes were bloodshot, almost glazed over. I knew he could see me but I felt like he was looking past me, somewhere off into the trees. 

Something had followed him back from that blizzard.Something wearing him like a coat that didn’t fit quite right.

I tried to carry on like nothing was wrong. Chopped wood. Melted snow. Checked the snares. But everything felt *off*, like the world had tilted just a little and never tilted back. It felt like a temporary lull in a winterkill blizzard. Silent, no wind, a peace that eats at your brain until the howling winds are welcome.

Charlie barely ate. Didn’t sleep, far as I could tell. Just sat by the fire at night, still as stone, staring into the flames like they were telling him something. He didn’t hum anymore. He didn’t nod when I spoke his name.

He didn’t blink.

Sometimes I’d wake up in the dark, feel his eyes on me from across the tent. Just… *watching*. One time I pretended to sleep, let my breathing stay slow. He leaned close—so close I could feel his breath on my cheek. It didn’t smell like anything. Not meat, not smoke, not man. Just cold.

I remembered stories then. From when I was little, sitting by my *mémère’s* stove in Buffalo Narrows, the heat crackling and her hands busy with beadwork. She used to tell me things when the wind howled outside, when the dogs whined for no reason and the oil lamp flickered low.

“Baptiste,” she’d whisper, “don’t go out when the lights dance.”

I’d ask why, wide-eyed, chewing bannock too fast.

“Because the *Wîhtiko* hunts in the wind. Because the *napêwak*—the star-people—they call down to you. They don’t always bring you back.”

She told me of men who wandered from camp and came back wrong. Hollowed out. Hungry for more than food. Spirits that waited in snowdrifts and drank from your soul like it was birch sap.

I used to laugh at those stories. Say they were just to scare kids. But now?

Now I wasn’t laughing.

I started keeping my rifle close. Real close. Wouldn’t let Charlie walk behind me anymore. Wouldn’t sleep unless I heard him lie down first. I carved a little charm from birch, like *mémère* taught me—a small face, tongue stuck out, to ward off evil. I strung it around my neck with sinew. It didn’t help.

Then one night—must’ve been close to midnight—I woke up. The fire was low, just coals and shadow. Wind had died down. Eerie kind of stillness, like the woods were holding their breath.

Charlie wasn’t in the tent.

I sat up fast, heart already thudding. Slipped on my boots and coat, grabbed the rifle, and pushed open the flap.

And there he was.

Standing out in the snow.

Naked.

Bare skin glowing blue-white under the northern lights, which were out in full, twisting and writhing across the sky like smoke made of bone. No sound. No breath. Just him, unmoving, looking up.

His body was wrong. Too still. Muscles frozen but not shivering. Snow piled at his feet but didn’t cling to his skin.

And then he turned.

Slow. Like something remembering how to move a human body.

His face—his *face*—was calm. But his eyes.

God help me, his eyes were pits. Not black. Not empty. Just… *gone*. Like someone had scooped out everything inside and left the skin behind. I’ve seen dead bears, seen wolves with their guts torn open, seen eyes clouded with death.

This wasn’t death.

This was older.

This was hunger without a mouth.

He looked at me. And I knew—*knew*—whatever had followed him in from the blizzard hadn’t just followed. It had moved in.

It was *wearing* him.

Kise-Manitow, nîmâkwên.

Namoya wîhtikow, namoya.

Great Creator, I am afraid.

No Sinew-Eater, not now.

Hear me, I am begging.

Give me a good life instead.

Recently, but not that recently, it's been running through my mind thoughts about the world outside and the world inside my mind, as of now, I'm still just having every step of my life controlled by parents, though whenever I claim that they're doing so, in my indirect ways, they almost even fight for their lives to prove that It's not what it is, and it's not everytime, but it happens, and I'm aware of this type of manipulation, it's stressing, disgusting to me, but I can't do anything about it, otherwise I'd be thrown in the streets with no help, and no, there's no CPS for me in this situation, not before, not now that I'm still getting to my 18's.

Thing is, if it's not through a book, the only way I can develop more knowledge that doesn't actually give me a job but gives me some unique personality is through shit apps that everyone uses, as I consume content from actually smart content creators and I'm always interested in knowing, though I'm aware the sub is pent up with discussions about religions, I'll have to admit that I consume that type of knowledge too, because, I had a better mental outcome as the years passed, from finally believing in something rather than mocking what seems to be really much higher than me (Though I've been doctrined to believe in it since I was born), but it's not about that I'm talking about, I'm just letting you guys understand my view with more information, maybe that way you'll all understand that I didn't **""Get mad at NTR""** for no reason, yes?

There's been this guy I've been watching, that you guys'll surely not like him if you ever understood him, he's a... ""a Brazilian mix of Kanye West's confidence, Andrew Tate’s controversial takes, and a digital nomad who flexes luxury while preaching hustle culture — ex-Ivy League, wrote a ton of books, got rich selling info online, and never stops talking about money, mindset, and breaking free from the matrix, however, he has daddy issues and lot of undiscussed problems inside, that led him to be what he is nowadays."" that's the best description I got of him, and he's just great at talking and making your mind you know?

I know that it seems funny now, but I'm only talking about one person from all the others I've been consuming things from, because, from this guy, I've understood that most of my life as a man is meant to be a bit destructive in order to find peace in the future and then be able to provide peace and rest for someone (Though I'm already a panda from all the things I've been enduring with a disturbing and hidden family), well, at least, from my pov, that is a bit depressing, I guess, and I get it too, once again, ""the book"" tells us, but since then, and I mean, a long time ago, it has been leaving me paranoic about my future in society, more scared of the future I'll have and how I'll be able to handle such things even though I forget if I took the trash out right after putting the trash outside.

Unfortunately I had a past filled with filthy thoughts, (of all types, filthy actions even) even though I was really young, because I wasn't getting disciplined due to lack of connections and protection, you know, divorce and childishness from parents always lead kids into voids of nothing when all the kids think about rotates around their material things and the world outside, in another worlds, rotates on their own innocence and lack of ambitions, it fortunately made me stronger to things like ""corn"", gore (which I watch from time to time, not for fun, but because I like to know how people die, to avoid having the same fate, a bit unhealthy yeah.) well, thing is, I still relapse and... it happened today.

I watch femdom, say whatever you want about that, it comforts me more than you can think of, not the kinky type, but the ""innocent"" part of it, ever seen memes where they print a +18 H with titles like ""True love, cuddles blah blah blah""? That's it, sometimes, I get a bit carried on and go a bit over the top, but it doesn't go much further than seeing art where the fantasy goes around tall girls and small guys, however, today, I saw NTR, it just came to my feed and I'm a bit retarded, so instead of just passing by and ignoring, I only noticed it was NTR when I was already reading almost the whole thing, it was literally just an art where two girls trap a guy into watching them having the time of their lives with a ""Gorilla"" of a guy while ""Us"" in the character's pov, watch from afar, getting humilliated.

At first, I tried to calm down and ignore it, but then words are a bitch, and I read the words in the image in my mind again and again as I tried to play, my ears got hot man, real shit, I read the bubbles saying ""Do you think she even knows you exist while she's at it?"" ""Look at her"" and the huge amount of bullshit these artists put, all of a sudden, I was up from my chair, I usually watch this content because I sometimes get lost in thought and it feels like I'm there, and for that reason, I got offended at this image, I know it's fake, I know, and I was aware of everything I was doing and I could stop, but I decided to keep going and I felt like my mind was going to explode, and it suddenly became words into my mouth as I kept repeating ""provide, provide, suffer, be silent, just provide and shut up, provide, provide, provide, nothing matters"" and things like that, in a sudden rage, I punched the brick wall about three times before it hurt like hell and my fists trembled, of course, they were not limp or anything, then I decided to do push ups while saying things, as if to give me more determination to do them, I did about 15 and the last time I did 20  push ups was like, 10 months ago, I was doing push ups really mad, and I everytime I talked the same NTR image came to mind, suddenly, I got a mat and decided to do sit-ups untill my abs were hurt, then I went to take the coldest bath on earth while repeating ""provide, provide, provide"" I was breathing hard as hell and had a sore throat after leaving the bath, couldn't care less, made a coffee for myself and drank it, untill the soreness was gone, now I'm here, writing all of this, hoping someone will read it.

Am I going insane or is the pressure getting to me? I don't know what to do about it, anyways, I'll go play sekiro right now as soulslike are the only games that give me some sort of satisfaction whenever I play them, I love it, ds1-3 elden ring, demon souls, crazy, well, anyways, have a good night, and if I'm not supposed to post this here, share me a subreddit where I could do so, I'm not a reddit expert, after all.",0,1754601183.0,TeenagersButBetter,1,0.5,False

The words echoed around in my head. 

I stood staring at the water tumbling from the tap. I'd been standing for what felt like hours, just watching it, going over and over the events of a few nights ago. I’d only seen that homeless man twice, but each time was vividly ingrained in my memory. Both times had been unnerving, but the second time… that was downright unhinged.

The first time had been just before work. I’d been walking the last part of my usual route, earphones in, walking on autopilot. In the brief silence as the song skipped to the next one, a clattering caught my ears. Startled, I turned to find its source.

In an alleyway behind a KFC, something rustled in the bins. It was the briefest of things, I could just about hear it over the song that had now started up. At first, I assumed it was an alley cat diving for its dinner. But then he stood, a black bag clutched in his fist. He didn’t seem to notice me watching him, he seemed far too enamoured with his prize.

Giddily, he raised it high above his head. Yellowing, foul liquid spewed from a split in its base, splashing into his eager, excited mouth below. Small chunks of rotting god knows what dribbled down with it, catching in his beard, but he didn't seem to care. His expression was almost gleeful.

I reflexively shuddered at the memory, blinking frantically to try and wash away the nausea it brought with it. The sound of the water dragged me back to my kitchen. The crystalline twinkling as the strip light above me filtered through it entranced me. Subconsciously, I slipped my hand into the torrent, letting the cool droplets wash over my fingertips.

For a second, I thought about cupping my hand, bringing it to my mouth. A queasy squirming in my stomach stopped that thought in its tracks as I remembered the second time. 

It had been worse, way worse.

I was nearly home, sat on the bus for the last part of my journey. Again, I had my earphones in, lost in my own little world. I know it's not the best thing to do on public transport, but I needed some kind of distraction.

I was jolted out of it when we came to a sudden stop as the driver slammed on the brakes. Taking my earphones out, several other passengers looked around, concerned looks on their faces, all drawn towards that front window. What I saw sent a cool chill trickling down my spine.

He was there again. In the middle of the road. 

That same homeless man, the stains of bin water still fresh on his already filthy clothes. He charged around the road, movements wild and erratic. Lurching left and right, he’d stagger one way, then the other, turning on a dime.

He was hunched over, hands outstretched to the floor. I caught the briefest glimpse of grey and pink inches from his fingers before it was snatched up. In a flurry, his hands wrapped around the thing, squeezing it tightly as he jerked it towards his face.

A trickle of crimson dribbled from the corner of his mouth, an earsplitting screech accompanying it as he bit down hard, the rat scrambling frantically between his fingers. He pulled his head back, revealing the rat again.

A large portion of its back was just… just gone.

The homeless man didn't seem to care. To a chorus of screams from my fellow passengers, he pressed his lips to the exposed flesh again and sucked hard. All anyone could do was watch on, horrified, as the man seemed to drain every ounce of fluid from the rat, siphoning everything it had.

I’m pretty sure someone behind me threw up, but I was paralysed, my eyes locked on the disgusting scene before me. A flash of anger darted across his face as he hurled the rat to the other side of the street, throwing his head back and letting out a yell.

“I’m so thirsty”

No one dared move, the bus was deathly silent.

As though realisation had suddenly dawned on him, the man scanned from side to side frantically, like he wasn’t really sure of where he was, before darting down a side alley. 

An uneasy feeling spread through the bus after that as the driver pulled away. No one dared utter a word. I think we were all traumatised by what we’d just seen.

When I finally got back home, I couldn’t relax, the gleeful expression of the homeless man replaying over and over in my head. I couldn’t bring myself to cook, every time I thought about food, all I could see was the gaping back of the rat.

Sleep didn't come easily either. I spent most of the night tossing and turning, trying to put the memories out of my mind. When I did finally manage to drop off, I had the strangest dream.

I was wandering in what I can only describe as an empty bog. It was dark, illuminated only by the crimson moon overhead. Through its reflection, I could see the translucent waters beneath me, blood red and still. 

With each step I took, the thin layer of water rippled outwards, going on unnaturally far, the undulations licking at my shoes.

There were trees spaced here and there, their long roots sucking up as much of the water as they could. Their trunks seemed to stretch on, climbing up and up until they were lost from sight. 

I couldn't make out what sat at their peak, but I couldn't help the feeling of being watched. Something about them made my skin crawl, and I couldn’t escape the unease that washed over me whenever I dared to glance in their direction.

A series of soft chittering clicks would shatter the stillness. Seeming to emerge from the trees, it was as though they were crying out. 

They shuddered, the vibration passing like a ripple all the way up their trunks as the sides seemed to split and more red water cascaded out. At the very edge of my hearing, I could have sworn that a low, angry grumble emanated from somewhere unfathomably high above me.

The more I looked at them, the more that clawing dread grew, screaming at me to tear my eyes away. Giving in to it, I averted my gaze, looking down to the glassy liquid at my feet. 

As I stared into it, I caught the briefest glimpse of movement. Straining my eyes to focus, it came again. I could make out small creatures writhing within it. They danced and turned, intertwining, then separating in intricate patterns as they swam.

I was mesmerised, watching their whirling and spinning reflected by the moonlight. The dread that had gripped me seemed to slip away, an odd sense of serenity slowly taking its place as I watched the beautiful ballet playing out in the water before me.

Something about these creatures seemed to call to me. Made me feel… safe?

I found myself crouching down, my mouth wet with saliva. I’d not even noticed, a small droplet falling from my lips the only indication. It rippled as it fell, the wavelets stretching on as the dancing creatures suddenly stopped their performance. 

As one, they darted to it, congregating together in a small ring around where it fell, what I assume was their heads looking up at me. It was so strange to see them so still. They all floated there, their thin, sinuous bodies watching me, beckoning me.

Unthinking, I dipped my hand into the water. It was cool, pooling in my cupped hand as I scooped them up. Bringing it to my lips, I drank deep, feeling each of the creatures wriggling and writhing gratefully in my open mouth as I smiled.

I snapped awake. 

My sheets were cold and damp, doing their best to cling to me. There was an odd, metallic taste on my tongue, like I’d sucked on an old coin, but it seemed to clear with a few swallows, and I thought nothing more of it. I tried to push the dream and those hideous memories to the back of my mind and just get on with my life.

It's been two days since then. Two, god-awful days. 

I barely noticed it at first. It was there when I woke from the dream. Just a dry tickle at the back of my throat, like when you’ve slept with your mouth open.

I’d take a sip of water, and it would go, but within minutes, it would be back again. A part of me felt like it was stronger each time it came back, even if only slightly so. I just put it down to being the beginnings of a cold and tried my best to ignore it, assuming it would get better in a couple of days.

But it just seemed to get worse.

In little over 24 hours, it had gone from an annoying tickle to a persistent, nagging pain. My tongue was tearing at the insides of my mouth with each movement. Speaking felt like an agony. My lips felt as though they were about to crack. Every time I swallowed, it felt like razors running down my throat.

But no matter what I did, nothing helped.

The obvious thing seemed to be to drink more water. But I’d already tried that.

Back in the kitchen, the tap still ran. The words of the homeless man echoed around in my head as I stared at the rush of water billowing from it. Grappling with the memories of those encounters, I watched my water bottle filling slowly, my impatience growing as each second seemed to stretch on and on.

I could barely wait until it was full before snatching it back and bringing it to my lips. The water sloshed out and into my gaping mouth. I felt it coat my dry tongue and slip down my arid throat.

Ravenously, I drank, emptying the bottle of its contents in seconds. The last of the icy liquid trickled from the neck, but there was no momentary relief this time.

My mouth still felt just as dry.

Turning the tap back on, I thought maybe I’d not drunk enough, maybe I needed more. Water bottle outstretched, I watched the crystalline liquid tumbling in a sharp jet. As it tumbled, an odd feeling overtook me.

My mouth was so dry, so painfully devoid of moisture, but the one thing that should remedy that repulsed me. It was the same tap, it made the same sound and produced the same stream as it always had. It had been purified and was sanitary, but it may as well have been sewage run off for all I wanted to drink it.

But I was still so thirsty

I still needed to drink.

Forcing it to my lips, the taste was almost rancid. The dryness burned my throat in a new flare of pain. I spat it out as though it were acid, for all it seemed to sting, half expecting it to burn a hole in the floor next to me.

I tried everything.

Juice. Nothing. 

Coffee. I gagged. 

Milk, beer, and vinegar. More pain.

Everything tasted wrong. They all had that rotten, sulphurous edge. The only thing that didn’t make me gag was... meat juice.

I’d come to make my dinner, opening up a packet of mince. Taking out the slab of meat, I dropped it in the pan, the soft sizzle fading to nothing as I stared at the empty container in my hand. 

It was like my eyes had been drawn to it, the muddy red sludge sitting in the bottom, calling to me.

Without quite registering what I was doing, I brought it to my nose and sniffed. The tang of iron and copper filled my nostrils, and I coughed a little. Still, I couldn't take my eyes away.

No matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept returning to one thing. Quickly, I put the packaging to my lips and tipped it back.

Sweet, mineral taste filled my mouth, thick clumps of it rolling across my tongue as the cold, congealed liquid slipped down my throat.

Snapping back to my senses, the metallic taste was still fresh on my tongue. I made to retch, horrified by what I’d just done.

But I felt fine, better than fine even.

I could have sworn that, for those few seconds, my thirst had ebbed away a little. Not gone, but a slight reprieve at least. It was short-lived, however, as when it came back, it came back hard. It felt like I’d been chewing sandpaper.

I couldn’t take it anymore. My flat felt too dry, too small. I needed air.

Maybe if I walked, it would go away. The thirst. It was stupid, but I was getting to the point where I would try anything to be rid of it.

Grabbing my coat and my earphones, I stepped out, climbing down the staircase and onto the street. I was half-scrolling on my phone when I rounded the corner…

He was in the road again, his stomach pressed flat to the ground as he frantically clawed underneath a parked car. The terrified hissing and yowling coming from beneath the vehicle scratched at my eardrums. They got louder and more panicked with each swipe of his hand.

I watched, frozen, the memory of the rat playing around in my head as he tried to work himself under the car. All of my senses seemed to drift away. I thought I heard an engine growl, birds tweeting overhead, but they were all muffled. I just stared at him, transfixed.

Without warning, the cat darted from its hiding place. The homeless man scrambled frantically to his feet in pursuit, grunting like a rabid animal.

A blaring horn ripped through the air. Screeching brakes. 

Then, a sickening crunch. A wet thump as his skull connected with the pavement.

He didn’t get back up.

The homeless man lay there, body crumpled and twitching, blood pooling from his head.

Everything seemed to fade away as I gawped at the scene. The sounds of a woman getting out of her car, the screams of other pedestrians, they were all a million miles away.

I should have been horrified, I should have rushed to him or dialled 999 or something. My phone was in my hand. All I had to do was press those three little numbers. 

But all I could do was stand there, entranced…

As I watched the blood slowly pool, soft ripples forming on its surface as he twitched, I could have sworn that for a second, I saw something writhing underneath. Tiny, sinuous shapes dancing in the dark. Beckoning me…

I couldn't help but salivate a little.

One thought pulsed in my mind. The words slipped out before I could stop them.

We talked for a good while at the show and hit it off. I asked for her number at the end of the night and she gave it to me.

I texted her the next day, and we continued to have good conversations via text. She was definitely engaging with me. I asked her to get coffee with me, and she agreed. We met up for coffee/went for a walk a week after I met her at the show and we both seemed to have a good time.

The conversations we have had up to this point have been mostly friendly, not really flirtatious. I felt very attracted to her so I confessed my feelings, told her she was beautiful, and asked if she had feelings for me. 

She gave a long answer about how she thought I was cute and impressed by me and is interested in getting to know me more. She also told me about how she has recently become single for the first time in 20 years after getting out of a couple of long term relationships and is torn on dating at the moment, and she wants to focus on some personal growth.  We kind of ended the conversation saying we would talk about it more at a later time.

We continued to text back and forth after that first ""date"" and went out again a second time a week later. I had a great time on our second time out and she seemed to as well. She was smiling, laughing and engaged in our conversations.

Fast forward to this week and there is now like 24 hours between text responses on her end. All of a sudden, it just seems like she lost interest in me. 

I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Do I address the elephant in the room and ask what changed? Do I just move on and leave her alone? I really like her and want her as a romantic partner, but honestly she would be nice to have as a friend at the very least.

I'm drowning in this life we've built.,"We had a baby 16 months ago, and since that moment, everything between my husband and I has just… dulled. I wouldn’t say it was perfect before, but something shifted after becoming parents. And in the last six months, it’s gotten *really* rough—for me, at least.

Some backstory: I met my husband when he was a functioning addict. He wasn’t falling apart in the stereotypical way, but he was using—and I knew that version of him intimately. He’s now been sober for about three months, which is great and I *am* proud of him… but also? I feel emotionally numb. And I hate that I feel that way.

It’s like… who is this person I married? I don’t know this sober version of him. And I know that sounds cruel, but it’s honest. Everything feels heavier now. I work full-time from home *while* keeping our daughter with me, I clean, cook, schedule doctor appointments, do bath time, run errands—everything. Every. Thing.

I’ve taken on more to support him during sobriety, and I’ve tried to be understanding. I’ve been putting in 80% so he can focus on his recovery. But I’m exhausted. Emotionally, mentally, physically. And I’m starting to notice the scale tipping into resentment.

To fix the financial mess we ended up in (largely due to the addiction), he took a second job. He works 9-5 and then the second job until 1 or 2AM, including weekends. I barely see him. When I do, we’re like ships passing in the night. He says, “This is what I have to do,” and I *get* that… but I’m so lonely I could scream.

I told him I feel disconnected and unhappy. His response? “This is life. This is what it is right now.” That’s it. No solution. No real conversation. Just a shoulder shrug and moving on.

We had a beach weekend planned, something I was desperately looking forward to. A break. A reset. The day before we were supposed to leave, he bailed—chose to work instead. Said he had to. I know he’s trying to fix the mess, but I wanted him to choose *us*, just once. I was crushed.

Context: I got pregnant while we were living across the country. I wanted to move home to raise our daughter around family, and we did. He’s been miserable ever since. He tells me he doesn’t see himself staying here forever. I can’t imagine ever leaving. So we’re also divided there, too.

He’s not a bad person. He’s a great dad when he’s around. He gets me coffee in the morning. He changes diapers. He’ll make dinner once in a while. But emotionally? He’s gone. And now, honestly? I feel gone too. Like I’ve become an absent wife. I’m just going through the motions. Fantasizing about being loved, held, *seen*. Feeling desired. Appreciated. Like I matter to someone.

He says this is just who he is. That he won’t change. That this is the person I married. And maybe he’s right—but it all feels *so* different now. Darker. Sadder. Heavier.

I don’t know what we’re avoiding, but it feels like we’re pretending this is sustainable when it’s not. I can’t live unhappy forever, right? But then I spiral—am I asking for too much? Is this just parenthood? Is it just the stage we’re in? Or is this the beginning of the end?

I don’t know how to move forward, but I know I can’t stay like this.
Thanks for letting me rant. I just needed to get it out of my head.

1mkbukt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1mkbukt/bad_habits_bad_actors_and_me_rant/,"BAD HABITS, BAD ACTORS AND Me <rant>","I want to say thank you to everyone who reads these stories. I wish I could cyber hug us all as we walk through this hell in gasoline jumpsuits. There are many days I want to throw up my hands, buy a pop camper and move to the woods or a beach or a lake like Jason, just anywhere I can go, WITHOUT running into a single soul I know.

My Dad (76) is in stage 2 but trending towards 3 as this train only moves in ONE direction (Nial is my favorite to those who read that in POP culture 😁). He lives alone and manages (if he desires) to wash dishes and clothes, clean a little, make coffee, anything you would trust to a 5th grader to do (daily skills wise). That's the good part. He can be belligerent but since I'm his primary caregiver I'm good at navigating his triggers so 90% of our days are fairly smooth.

Here's my ISSUE... My Dad was a skirt chaser (to put it kindly) and had more than his fair share of friends over these last 10 years of his own version of Golden Bachelor. AS a kid he was a MESS ( it was the 80s, and he did his level worst most days) but as I grew older we repaired our relationship. By the time I was 25 things really GOT good. For the next 2 decades there was peace and healing for all the harm he caused AND HE DID THE WORK. He MADE AMENDS sincerely, and then dementia came along to WRECK IT ALL. after his 3rd marriage ended, he did as he pleased. I honestly didn't care about his comings and goings because he is GOOD AND GROWN. WELL fast forward to where we are now and THE LYING LIAR he must have been in THOSE streets is driving me bat SHXT crazy. He has random ""encounters"" with his ""friends"" which means he is financially problematic. His poor decision making, left him with NO retirement , just his SS income, even though he retired with a significant savings. My brother struggles to manage his spending because he still drives and has access to bank accounts and credit cards and I can't get my family to limit to that  sh xt. His girlfriend is nice enough, but has her own health challenges, and the rest of the parasites are used to him being generous, but unfortunately NOW he doesn't have the resources for ALLL of that , anymore.

And of course when we have talked to him about budgeting or managing his finances, we get one of 2 responses ( Ok I'll do better - aka leave me TF alone; orrr It's my money why can't I do <insert dumb shxt>. The few times he loses it and goes bananas is when we tell him, hey Buddy you're fkn up.. smdh) All the bills are on auto pay so at least his utilities are safe , and I take great comfort in that. Yesterday he was ""busy"" and I didn't hear from him. Today, I talked with him about getting him something to eat. He said he would. I go by his place  2 hours later, NO FOOD. He had eaten just a piece of toast and had coffee. (I text him everything bc of his memory, so he has A record of stuff to do. He had a way to call the place and place his order. He did it yesterday at a fish house with him and his ""friend"" but today, nahhh daughter, FEED ME SEYMONIA)  Now if he wants to ""have a visitor"" over, this man GETS UP, straightens the house, will text me NOT to come over, and picks up his playdate with ZERO assistance from me. But when he needs a simple plate of food from the Taqueria , he will lie, say he did it, and I go to check up on him and do meds, and its excuse on top of lies. But in his words, he is NOT lying, he just hadn't done it yet. 

I guess that's my frustration. When he wants to be independent and grown (however limited) he does so with no issues , but he will happily, ask me to do tasks I know he can still do. Moreover, he isn't ASKING THESE visitors to do sh xt, and yet they are ""benefiting"" from his kindness in whatever ways they can. I've tried talking to him about it but it's a dead end. Even if he agrees , with in hours he won't remember the conversation. I have it GOOOOOD when I think about how many of you are struggling, with FAR WORSE symptoms for FAR LONGER ( this is like year 3 for us and rapidly declining) but I cant help but be ENRAGED by his antics and knowing his OLD HABITS are making our NEW life HELL.

If you made it this far THANKS. SORRY for the rant given the POOP Olympics, MCU gauntlet, and caregiver albatross, so many of you experience. We have it GOOOOOD, but I just feel like an eternal Olympic flame of rage and I know my time ""in the box"" won't be as long as many of you have experienced.

I've visited Portland many times but I am not very familiar with the neighborhoods. 

I've done some initial research into family friendly neighborhoods but it's hard to pinpoint where to start without having good  data from locals. Some of my criteria are: safety/low crime, great schools, young family areas, walkability... with that, a couple of questions!

Where would be a good central hub to get our airbnb while we house hunt? 

What are some of the best schools?

Best spots to go and grab a coffee or brunch?

Best/safest/cleanest parks?

Are there good spots to rock climb/boulder?

Are there any popular outdoor chess spots?

Welp here's the five starting chapters,
EDIT:I plan to openly admit i use AI to write ts and i would like it to be completely free


chapter 1: the arrival

the morning was dragging like it always did, the office building sitting quiet except for the hum of the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. dust particles floated lazily in the shafts of sunlight struggling through the blinds. everything smelled like old coffee and stale paperwork, a place where dreams came to die—or just get put on hold till quitting time.

the elevator dinged and the doors slid open with that familiar creak. doakes was the first to step out, his heavy boots thudding against the linoleum like a storm rolling in. his face was already set in that “don’t talk to me” scowl, clutching his chipped mug like it was a lifeline. he muttered under his breath about the lousy coffee and the idiots he had to deal with. no one dared to disagree.

clark kent followed behind, trying his best to blend in. his glasses were slightly crooked and his trench coat hung loose, barely hiding the faint bulge of his iconic red and blue underneath. he adjusted his tie nervously and scanned the room like he was expecting trouble, which, honestly, in this office was the least you could expect.

dexter morgan came in next, calm and collected as always, eyes sharp and cold. there was something unnerving about the way he looked at people, like he was analyzing every flaw and secret they tried to hide. people gave him space, and for once, doakes nodded in quiet respect—though he’d never admit it.

bruce wayne walked in like he owned the place—which, honestly, he probably did. designer suit pressed perfectly, a confident smirk playing on his lips. he didn’t bother with small talk, already making mental notes on how to buy the building, the company, maybe the entire block if he felt like it.

angel bautista brought some warmth into the room, carrying a tray with fresh cafecito and pastelitos. his smile was genuine, and the smell of coffee was like a tiny rebellion against the brewing storm.

then jesse pinkman exploded through the door like a firecracker, wild eyes scanning, voice loud. “yo who the hell stole my snacks?” chaos started in an instant. patrick bateman sipped his coffee, that creepy smile on his face like he was enjoying the madness a little too much. happy gilmore swung an invisible golf club and nearly knocked over a lamp.

luke skywalker appeared in a flash of light, lightsaber hanging at his side, muttering about “the force being off.” peter parker crawled along the walls, spider-sense twitching at every sound. doomguy stomped in with a grim look, ready for war. goku floated in, muscles tense, a grin on his face like he wanted to throw down just for fun.

optimus prime’s hologram flickered to life, calm and commanding. peter griffin tripped over the threshold, sending a box of donuts flying. solid snake melted into the vents, eyes sharp. ronaldo juggled a soccer ball in the hall, carefree. rick sanchez stumbled in, flask in hand, mumbling about portals and dimension hopping. dr strange appeared in a swirl of magic, looking exhausted. baymax quietly rolled in, scanning everyone’s health with his soft robotic voice.

harrison and hank looked overwhelmed and suspicious as fernando alonso drifted in on an office chair like he was in a race. special agent lundy pulled out a folder, already making notes on the chaos unfolding.

phoenix wright shouted “OBJECTION!” at no one in particular, as if trying to bring order with just his voice.

and then, barely noticeable, a mosquito buzzed in and landed on doakes’s mug.

and it never left.



chapter 2: the mosquito

the office had barely settled from the chaos of that morning when a new menace arrived — small, buzzing, and utterly relentless. the mosquito. a tiny, annoying bloodsucker nobody wanted but nobody could ignore.

it slipped through the cracked window, unseen by most, but doakes immediately caught sight of it. the damn thing landed on his chipped mug like it owned the place, and he swatted at it with a growl, but it dodged him like a ghost. that was just the start.

goku was the first to really feel its sting. a tiny prick on his arm, but even he let out a sharp grunt, irritation flickering in his usually calm grin. doomguy immediately pulled out his massive gun and fired several shots. the mosquito zigged and zagged, barely touched, buzzing louder as if mocking the assault.

dr strange muttered ancient incantations, hands weaving through the air to trap the pest in magical bindings. but the mosquito slipped through cracks in his spells like a shadow, immune to every trick. baymax moved carefully among the desks, scanning every human for bites and bruises, trying to soothe the itch with his gentle voice and medical skills.

doakes was losing his mind. every time he swung a fist or a rolled-up paper at the little pest, it disappeared, only to return moments later with a vengeance. his cursing filled the air, louder than the buzz.

clark kent adjusted his glasses, furrowing his brow. he used his x-ray vision to locate the pest, but the mosquito was just a blur, a tiny flicker impossible to catch. rick sanchez stumbled in from the breakroom, flask in hand, and squinted at the chaos. “that thing’s not just a mosquito, man, it’s like a micro god or some shit,” he muttered, slurring words as he pulled out weird gadgets from his bag.

solid snake laid traps in the vents, setting tiny nets and traps designed for small animals, but the mosquito was smarter than any trap. it buzzed free every time, laughing in its own tiny way.

then came the pest control guy — normal in every way, calm but serious. he walked in with a tennis racket rigged with electric wires and a canister of anti-mosquito gas. “i’m here to end this,” he said, voice steady despite the madness.

the battle began. pest control guy chased the mosquito through desks, vents, and filing cabinets, releasing gas and swinging his racket. the mosquito danced around every attack with impossible speed, buzzing in their ears, biting anyone who got close.

the office filled with smoke and tension. people evacuated their desks, coughing and swatting, watching the ridiculous fight unfold like a bad action movie.

but the mosquito survived.

and pest control guy limped out, coughing, eyes wide with something between fear and respect.

“it whispered to me,” he said quietly, before disappearing down the hallway, promising to return. the fight was far from over.

meanwhile, everyone else in the office scratched and swatted, their clothes covered in tiny red bites. the mood was tense, itchy, and electric.

the mosquito had become the new ruler of the office.



chapter 3: the donut box

the office was already a mess. that annoying mosquito buzzing around doakes’s mug like it owned the place, the strange fights, the odd people—all of it was normal now. or as normal as this crazy place could get.

then out of nowhere, no warning, no sign, just BAM. sitting right in the middle of the breakroom table, a pristine white box appeared like some kind of magic trick. no footsteps, no delivery guy, no email, no nothing. just there. like someone dropped it from another universe or slipped it through a portal nobody saw.

six donuts inside. six perfect donuts. glazed just right, some sprinkled with rainbow stuff, others dusted with cinnamon. they looked too good. too clean. like they didn’t belong in this dusty, stale office filled with burnt coffee and bad vibes.

everyone just stared. no one moved. it was like the box sucked the air out of the room.

jesse pinkman was the first to break the silence, stomach growling like it wanted to eat him alive. “yo, what the heck, are these for real?” he said, eyes wide, fingers twitching as he grabbed the chocolate-glazed donut like it was a lifeline. he bit down hard, ignoring the sticky glaze that dripped all over his hand.

peter parker’s spider-sense was screaming. he crawled closer, eyes darting all around like he was hunting for traps. he carefully webbed one donut to the fridge, whispering, “gonna save this… for later.” as if the donuts might vanish into thin air or explode or some crazy stuff.

goku? man just grinned like he hit the jackpot and shoved two donuts in his mouth before anyone could stop him. “these taste like victory,” he said between bites, muscles flexing like he just powered up.

ronaldo kicked one donut like it was a soccer ball, sending it flying into the ceiling tiles. everyone’s eyes followed it but the donut disappeared like a ghost. nobody knew where it went and that little mystery sent a shiver down everyone’s spines.

patrick bateman leaned back in his chair, smirk curling up like a shark smelling blood. “someone’s messing with us,” he said real quiet but sharp as hell. “and it’s not a joke.”

phoenix wright slammed his fist on the table, papers scattering everywhere. “we need answers! who left this box here? who touched the donuts? witnesses, evidence, NOW!”

the office lost it again. jesse blamed happy gilmore for stealing the last donut, happy blamed luke skywalker for using the force to swipe snacks. clark kent tried to calm things down, adjusting his crooked glasses nervously, but even he looked like he was ready to run away.

next morning? same box. same six perfect donuts. just sitting there like taunting everyone. no note. no clue. just mocking them all.

rumors spread faster than wildfire. cursed donuts? magical sweets? rick sanchez’s latest science mistake? or some dark stuff nobody wanted to say out loud.

doakes swore the box moved when no one looked. “that thing’s alive,” he growled, pounding his fist on the table like he wanted to smash it to bits.

angel bautista tried to keep the peace, bringing fresh coffee and telling everyone to chill, but even his calm voice shook a little. the mosquito bites everyone had didn’t help, making the office feel like a war zone.

everyone wanted the donuts but nobody trusted them.

the mystery stuck around like the glaze stuck to your fingers after one bite.

and somewhere, watching from the shadows, someone smiled.

the donut box wasn’t just donuts anymore.

it was a message.

a warning.

the start of some messed up stuff no one was ready for.

chapter 4: tension rising

the office had this weird stillness that wasn’t peaceful at all. it was the kind of quiet that makes you want to look over your shoulder every two seconds like something bad’s about to jump out and slap you. the fluorescent lights flickered with that usual annoying buzz, the smell of burnt coffee mixed with stale air hanging thick. doakes sat at his desk, fists clenched tight around his chipped mug, eyes burning with frustration as the mosquito buzzed endlessly near him, like some tiny demon with no plans to quit.

the donut box sat right there on the breakroom table like it owned the place. six perfect donuts, glazed and sprinkled just right, each one looking almost too perfect. the kind of thing you’d see on a fancy bakery shelf, not some grimy office table surrounded by chaos and weirdos. nobody touched it. nobody dared. it was like the box carried some invisible weight, a threat that made the room hold its breath.

doakes got up, pacing like a caged animal. “who the hell leaves a box like this with no note, no warning? what’s the point? it’s some kind of sick joke or a message,” he growled low, voice rough like gravel. he slammed his fist down on the table but the box didn’t move, just sat there, mocking him with its silence.

clark kent, usually the picture of calm, looked anything but. his fingers hovered over the keyboard, typing without really thinking, eyes flickering to the box every few seconds. his glasses kept slipping down his nose as if they were trying to shield him from whatever was coming. even clark felt the weight pressing down like a storm cloud ready to burst.

jesse pinkman was quieter than usual. no wild outbursts, no angry yelling, just sitting in the corner with a half-eaten donut he swiped when no one was watching. his eyes darted nervously around, like he was waiting for something or someone to jump out and ruin everything. “this ain’t just some random snack showing up,” he muttered, voice low but steady. “it’s a message. someone wants us off balance, maybe scared, maybe confused.”

patrick bateman stood by the window, arms crossed, eyes sharp and cold like a shark sizing up prey. “it’s a game,” he said softly but with deadly certainty. “we’re pawns in someone else’s plan. whoever dropped that box wants control, wants us distracted and vulnerable.”

phoenix wright was already trying to take charge, pulling people together, papers in hand. “we need to figure out who’s watching us, who’s behind this,” he said with urgency. “this isn’t about donuts. it’s about power. about control. we can’t just sit here waiting.”

rick was slouched in his chair, flask barely leaving his lips. “man, y’all slow as hell,” he mumbled, eyes half-lidded. “that box ain’t just snacks. it’s some kinda trap. like they wanna see how messed up we get. testin’ us or some shit.”

goku cracked his fingers, looking ready but chill. “if it comes to a fight, cool. but first we gotta find who put this mess here. then we settle it.”

the whole office felt heavy, like you could cut the tension with anything. people glanced sideways, whisperin’ like they didn’t wanna get caught sayin’ too much. trust? nah, that was gone. everyone watching everyone else, trying to figure out who’d snap first.

angel bautista moved around, bringing coffee and trying to calm things down. even his usual calm sounded shaky, like he was holdin’ it together by a thread. those damn mosquito bites didn’t help—everyone was scratchin’ and jumpy, like the tiniest thing could set off a full blown fight.


special agent lundy pulled out a folder filled with notes and pictures, trying to piece together whatever clues they could find. “we need to watch for anything unusual,” he said, eyes scanning the room like a hawk. “someone is sending us a message, and we have to figure out what before it’s too late.”

harrison and hank shared a worried look, both knowing this was bigger than any of them expected. fernando alonso spun in his office chair nervously, breaking the tension with a forced laugh that didn’t reach his eyes.

and through it all, the mosquito kept buzzing near doakes, relentless and stubborn, a reminder that even the smallest things could drive a whole place mad.

the donut box wasn’t just sitting there anymore.

it was waiting.

watching.

calculating.

and everyone felt it.

something was coming.

something no one was ready for.

the start of a nightmare none of them could escape.

chapter 5: waiting for the sting

the office was heavy with silence, but not the kind that felt calm. more like the quiet right before everything snaps, like a wire stretched too tight. the donut box sat on the breakroom table, six perfect donuts untouched, just staring back like some weird challenge nobody wanted to take. everyone’s eyes kept drifting toward it, but nobody moved. it was like the box was daring them to touch it—and maybe none of them were brave enough. 💔

jesse pinkman slouched in his chair, eyes bloodshot and twitchy. his fingers drummed a restless rhythm on the desk, like a storm was brewing inside his head. he hadn’t slept well. hell, none of them had. the box was like a bad omen, hanging over the office like a cloud no one could shake.

doakes scratched at his arms again, the itchy red marks from the mosquito bites like a slow-burning fire beneath his skin. the damn bug was still out there somewhere—buzzing, invisible, but always present. the sound was maddening, a constant reminder that something was wrong. something big.

then the vent rattled with a low thud. all eyes snapped to the ceiling as a shadow dropped down with a heavy thump. the pest control guy had returned. his hazmat suit was torn and scuffed, the visor cracked and foggy. his eyes darted around the room, wild and haunted, like a man who’d seen things no one else could believe.

he stood still for a moment, breathing hard, as if he’d been running from something no one could see. then he finally spoke, voice low and tight, breaking the thick silence.

“it whispered to me,” he said. “not with words. more like a feeling. a warning. like it’s waiting. watching. waiting for something.”

rick snorted from the couch, lazily flicking his flask. “waiting for what, man? For you to lose your mind?”

pest guy didn’t answer. instead, his eyes flicked nervously to the shadows near the walls, like he could sense the mosquito’s presence even without seeing it.

“i burned it,” he said quietly. “froze it. trapped it. drowned it. but it just comes back. every time. like it’s alive. smarter than it should be.”

clark adjusted his glasses, fingers trembling slightly. “do you think it’s dangerous?”

“danger’s not the word,” pest guy muttered. “it’s patient. like it’s watching us break down. seeing how long before someone snaps.”

phoenix wright slammed his fist on the table, papers flying. “we can’t just wait around. we need a plan, fast.”

patrick bateman watched from the corner, cold and calculating. “it’s a game,” he said softly. “and we’re the pieces.”

the buzzing grew louder, slicing through the thick tension like a blade. doakes swung wildly at the air, frustration boiling over. “if it bites me again, i swear—”

jesse shook his head, voice barely a whisper. “it ain’t just a bite anymore. it’s marking us.”

pest guy nodded slowly, the haunted look deepening. “it’s waiting for something big. i feel it. when it strikes, it won’t just be a nuisance.”

rick rolled his eyes but didn’t say a word. even he couldn’t ignore the cold weight settling over the room.

the donut box stayed on the table, silent and still. a shadow on the edge of everything.

and the pest guy? he was waiting too.

waiting for the sting.

waiting for the moment when everything would fall apart.

waiting for the truth none of them wanted to face.

because this wasn’t just about a mosquito.

it was about survival.

and none of them were ready for what came next.

Should I continue it? And how should I improve? thx 🙏

1mkbng5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1mkbng5/im_looking_for_support_and_possibly_guidance_i/,I'm looking for support and possibly guidance.  I don't really know yet.,"I am 33F.  My partner is 35mtF. I would like to start by saying that I don't know a lot of the correct terms for these behaviors or patterns.  Additionally, although my partner has agreed that she probably has certain labels, she refuses to get a professional diagnosis; however, she has multiple family members who have been diagnosed with various related things.  

I have been with this person for most of the last 15 years.  I have a lot of trauma surrounding love, and I have a very unhealthy attachment to her.  She has always had what I now consider ""episodes"".  Sometimes she is so sweet and loving and helpful; she'll tell me she loves me, that I'm the best thing that ever happened to her, and that she wants to grow old with me.  During these times, she'll be very supportive and kind, but still not very good at observing or self-starting.  Then other times, she tells me she hates me and wants me out of her life; that she only pretends to love me to get along with me better, that she hates having to consider me and my feelings, and that she can't wait to be rid of me.  During these times, she usually also talks about wanting to run away and start over in a place where no one knows her or knows she's trans.  She used to be very physically violent and abusive, but that's rare these days.  Now, she's mostly verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive.  I've gotten to a point where I separate her in my head: I have one name for her when she's kind, and another name for her when she's...angry and mean.  

For years, I have made excuses for her to myself.  I told myself she had trauma and that if I was patient enough, she would eventually open up to me.  After we divorced, I figured out she was trans and asked her about it - she admitted she was and had been lying to herself, and she came out.  I was so happy; I thought that meant things could be better and we could start fresh.  For some reason, she was angry and bitter toward me for a long time instead; to this day, she still says she doesn't know why she reacted this way to me, even though I was the most supportive and accepting person in her life.  Since then, I have continued to try to be patient and understanding; I think my reason for doing so probably stems from a lot of abandonment trauma I have.   I want to be clear that I am not blaming her for this.  Her brain and emotions work the way they do.  I also recognize that I carry a large part of the blame; not just for enabling her, but also for being stubborn and difficult to live with. 

The below list are some of the things I remind myself of to try to convince myself this situation is unhealthy.  In the last year:

* She told me she was planning my birthday, only to actually plan nothing and give me no gifts.  All I asked for was for her to write me something, which she's never done for be before, but she is talented at.  Instead, she emailed a love letter to the guy (we'll call him CJ) she was infatuated with when we first met - she sent this to him on my birthday.
* She cheated on me for the first time with someone she found on reddit in the casual encounters sub, then picked a fight with me so she could drop this bomb on me in the middle of an argument and then told me I was unreasonable for being upset.  We later found out that woman had herpes.
* I was t-boned while driving her car, which she got a very large payout for.  Her dad brought her to the accident.  He hugged me repeatedly, asking if I was ok; she angrily stormed past me, refusing to even look at me or speak to me.  I later found out she had started her affair that morning.  
* She started posting prompts to different subreddits inviting people to chat with her, then proceeded to find guys to flirt with from there.  One day, she was treating me really poorly when I came home.  After me asking what was wrong, apologizing for anything I could have done to upset het, and begging her to just be kind to me or tell me what was wrong, she told me she sexted with someone off reddit earlier that day.
* She cut off things with the affair from reddit, telling me she wanted to focus on us and fix our relationship, only to turn around and start trying to text CJ again.  
* She surprised me at work with flowers, and wrote me a poem for the first time, then later told me she only did that to shut me up.  
* She told me she wanted to get ""railed by some rando dude"", and was even willing to go to grindr to find that.  She never went that far, thankfully.
* A few days before we found out our dog had inoperable tumors, she started texting CJ again.  I would later find out that she continued to text CJ during the entire last 3 weeks of our dog's life.  After our dog passed, she told me she wouldn't reach out to him anymore and she was done with him.  Two days later, she messaged him happy birthday, and told me I was being unreasonable for being upset. 
* She told me again how unhealthy she had been and how she wants to do better for herself and us. 
* Now, she has decided she's going to ask CJ to meet up with her for coffee.  She says it's so she can get closure.  
* All of this has happened while she was living with me, I have been her primary/sole source of transportation, and I cover 75% of our expenses.  We have also continued to be intimate at least once a week.

I am to a point now where I have realized that this is it.  This is just how things are with her.  There is no healing.  There is no getting better.  I will never have real love from her.  I try to remind myself every day that she doesn't really love me and that she is incapable of unconditional or consistent love, but I am also unhealthy and I'm so terrified of the feelings of abandonment that come with being alone.  My parents were very abusive, and I have been no contact with them for 3 years now.  I have my biological mom to talk to, but she lives in Hawaii and is also diagnosed BPD, so asking her for advice on this is often difficult.    I read everything I wrote above and I know if anyone else told me all of these things I would tell them to leave immediately, but it just isn't easy.  I want her to love me so badly, and I don't want to give up.  But I know this whole thing is unhealthy and I need to.  

I don't know where to start trying to heal myself, or trying to disconnect from the situation.  I think I should start therapy, but I'm not sure what type of specialties/experience I should look for, or what kind of questions to ask them to feel them out.  I don't have much of a support system, so I also feel very weak and scared about the prospect of facing this up-hill challenge.  

If anyone has any advice on where to start self-reflecting, healing, finding therapy, etc. I would very much appreciate it.  ",4,1754599793.0,BPDlovedones,2,1.0,False
1mkbnce,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mkbnce/building_b2b_tinder_biz_intelligence_platform/,Building B2B tinder + biz intelligence platform. Would you rip this?,"Hello,

First off, this sub is full of fucking savages. The way you all use tech to solve niche problems and *actually* make money doing it, respect.



I’m Grant. I run a payment processing company called Sleft. We offer 0% card fees and literally pay merchants to work with us. Family business, solid margins, great value prop — but cold outreach? Meh. Door-to-door worked but burned me out. Cold email had some traction, but it still felt like shouting into the void. I needed an even better offer for my core business so I started dabbling in this idea of creating a product to better help me sell our services. 

I pretty much thought to myself:

What do most businesses actually want?

→ More, higher LTV clients/customers.

→ Better revenue streams in general.

That’s it.

Most of them sit around waiting, or burn cash on lead-gen agencies with bs guarantees. I’ve tried that route. It’s trash.



So here’s what we’re building:

A tool that uses AI + scraping to connect businesses with **high-ROI partnership opportunities**, *automatically*.

* No swiping (so not really tinder, sigh)
* It's not linkedin (too crowded imo)
* No awkward chamber of commerce mixers/BNI meetups, slight waste of time/not scalable really



here are some use cases we are considering:

* You run a gym? → Get matched with the coffee shop down the block 
* You sell sunscreen? → Meet the swimsuit brand doing summer promos
* You build SaaS for HR teams? → We intro you to 4 recruiting platforms who need your shit
* You’re a seed-stage SaaS with a $99/mo plan? → Match with another startup serving the same ICP and run a joint offer or list swap

So that's the partnership idea, here's the business intelligence idea:

* Scrape news + events so you know what’s happening in your ecosystem
* Surface trends from your industry (so you can zig before others zag)
* Find high-signal local events you should show up at (I think this is underrated)
* Deliver it all as a free “intel briefing” to warm people into our product

Basically: **business intelligence as a lead magnet,** and a warm intro engine (partnership portal) behind the curtain.

This entire thing is just value-first sales, give businesses actual market context, then offer something that helps them move on it.

**Who’s it for?** (eh, we're doing customer discovery to figure this one out)

* SaaS founders (especially B2B)
* E-comm/retail stores
* VCs/PE firms and deal originators
* Local SMBs looking for foot traffic or cross-promos (our main vertical)



**So here’s the ask:**

Would *you* use this?

We’re live with a waitlist and iterating with early users.

If it sounds cool, join the waitlist ;) I’ll also likely DM you personally to get a feel for how we can help in your use case, these types of interviews are the only way we build the product successfully. 

👉 [https://sleft-signals-waitlist.vercel.app](https://sleft-signals-waitlist.vercel.app)

obviously it's all free 



Thank you again to everyone for the wonderful banter/solidly brilliant ideas in this subreddit. It has legitimately motivated me to do this, and it has been a nice routine reading everyone's stuff at night before i cry and go to bed because I am broke. 

Cheers and keep building stuff that's cool.

On January 22, 1972, a bitter wind howled through the cracked streets of Trenton, New Jersey. Snow drifted lazily past windows stained with age, and a black veil fluttered outside the open door of the Whitmore home. Inside, Margaret Whitmore stood alone beside her son's closed casket, her knees trembling under the weight of both grief and guilt. Andrew had been her only child. He'd enlisted against her wishes, too young to understand what war did to the living long after the dead were buried.

She wept at the funeral, but more so the next day, and the next. The house, once filled with the chaos of teenage arguments and late-night music, now echoed with nothing but her footsteps and the sigh of winter drafts. Meals went untouched. The television remained off. She couldn't even bring herself to clean Andrew's room.

Three days after the funeral, at dawn, the doorbell rang.

Startled and annoyed at first—no one ever visited her—Margaret opened the door in her housecoat and slippers. There, on the doorstep, was an arrangement of lilies. Not white, not yellow, but in colors she'd never seen in a flower before: radiant reds, vibrant blues, greens like cut emeralds. The petals shimmered faintly as though the dew upon them was catching a light that wasn't there.

Pinned to the side of the bouquet was a small handwritten note on thick, cream-colored paper.

“Take care of me and I will always bloom. Disregard me and I will die.”

Margaret frowned. There was no signature. No delivery truck in sight. The note had no address or return name.

""How strange,"" she murmured aloud, fingers brushing one of the petals.

She brought the flowers inside. Not because she needed beauty, but because—after three days of grayness—she needed anything that wasn't hollow or cold.

She placed the bouquet on the kitchen table, next to a stack of sympathy cards and a plate of uneaten toast. A forgotten sense stirred in her, something close to purpose. She found an old glass vase and filled it with water. She trimmed the stems. She turned the bouquet to face the window, letting the morning light pour over it. The petals shimmered brighter when the sun touched them.

That evening, she thought of her son less and more of the lilies. Were they wilting? Did they need more water? Was it too cold near the window?

She moved them to a warmer spot and turned on the heat. She whispered to them—half-mocking herself, half-earnest.

Over the weeks, Margaret changed.

The flowers never aged. Not one petal fell. No browning at the edges. No scent of rot. Just that strange iridescence and their quiet beauty.

Neighbors noticed Margaret walking again, her steps lighter. The bags under her eyes began to fade. She cleaned Andrew's room. She didn't remove his things, but she dusted, vacuumed, and folded. She sat at the kitchen table again, not to cry but to sip coffee and tend the lilies.

Thousands of miles away, in a dusty, one-room shack in Honolulu, the Nakamura family sat on the edge of despair. Masaru and Kiko Nakamura, survivors of the internment camps during World War II, had lost their only son, Satoshi, in a senseless accident just a block from home. A drunk driver. A blink. A life gone.

They'd survived barbed wire and shame, labor and loss. But this was too much.

Kiko had not eaten in days. Masaru sat motionless most nights, staring at the boy's photo like he could will it to speak. One night, they made a pact. When the sun rose, they would both go.

But the sun beat them to it. Before it crested the mountains, a knock came. They both opened the door, weak and curious. On the step, resting against the splintered wood, was a basket of chrysanthemums—white, radiant, more like soft light than flora. Nestled in their center, a note:

“Take care of me and I will always bloom. Disregard me and I will die.”

No one had been outside. No one had passed by. The streets were silent.

They took it as a sign.

They cleaned the house. They dressed the altar with care. They placed the basket beneath Satoshi's photo. Kiko, with shaking hands, made tea and poured a cup for the boy's spirit. Masaru opened the windows to let in the morning breeze.

It did not heal them. But it stayed them.

Over the months and years, it spread.

Children who lost dolls woke to find marigolds on their pillows, their centers swirling with colors like marbles. Widowers mourning wives found daffodils tucked into coat pockets, their yellow glowing with hues unseen by mortal eyes. Pet owners who buried their best friends found sunflowers watching them from garden corners, turning slowly toward their faces rather than the sun.

Each came with the same message.

“Take care of me and I will always bloom. Disregard me and I will die.”

It was not a metaphor. People learned that quickly. If neglected, the flowers didn't simply wilt—they decayed into black ash, like burned paper.

But for those who nurtured them, the blooms defied nature. They were not immortal, but perpetual—sustained by care, thriving on attention, reflective of the healing process they catalyzed.

No one knew where they came from. No delivery service claimed credit. No botanist could identify them. Attempts to replicate or clone the flowers failed. Their colors faded. The mystery remained.

Theologians speculated. Scientists scrambled. The world barely noticed, at first. But over the decades, stories piled up. News segments called it ""The Blooming."" Faith groups debated whether it was divine intervention, alien mercy, or mass delusion.

But those who received them never questioned their purpose.

In a realm far beyond what eyes can see or minds can hold, the angels watched.

It had taken them centuries to intervene in such a simple, human way. Time did not pass the same for them. Where demons sowed pain through bomb and betrayal, angels had turned to subtler tools. Grief was a wound they could not close—but perhaps they could keep it from festering.

With each bloom, a thread was tied. Not to erase the hurt, but to give it shape. A tether to the world for those drifting away.

The demons mocked the effort, of course.

""They are *flowers*,"" they hissed. ""We have war. Fire. Despair.""

But the angels knew better. Despair was not always loud. Sometimes, it was silent, slow, like frost. And sometimes, all it took to stop the frost from creeping further was a bloom warmed by morning light and a note written by the hand of hope.

The flowers keep arriving quietly, without any fanfare. Maybe they are rarer now, or maybe we've learned to see them as just another part of life. But somewhere today, someone has opened a door. And there, shimmering with impossible colors, waits something small and beautiful.

And as long as they care for it…

It will never die.

Can you be marriage-minded and still give allowance? Asking for my sanity.","After a few tries at dating on Seeking, I’m feeling frustrated, conflicted, and honestly a little disappointed.

I’ve been in the bowl for about 7 years, and lately I’ve been shifting toward “dating” on seeking — mostly with men closer to my age (I’m 30), many of whom tag themselves as marriage-minded.

But honestly? It just feels like vanilla dating… on a sugar site. Maybe I’ll get a pedicure covered, but it’s nothing like what I’ve experienced with older, more established (or sometimes married) SDs who offered allowances, helped with bills, or funded trips.

What’s the point of men my age being on seeking with “marriage-minded” tags if they act like it’s regular dating and don’t offer meaningful support? Are they confused or am I?

Maybe they’re just not financially stable yet, but if that’s the case… why be on a sugar site at all? Why not just stick to Tinder and be a decent guy there?

I’m struggling with the idea of compromising my standards for younger, less generous men who don’t even offer the lifestyle I could easily have with older, wealthier ones and then they get offended that I’m dating around and seeing other people. 

What does “dating” look like for an experienced sugar baby now? Not to sound like a bitch but I still want the perks and security that sugar dating gave me. I’m not looking to trade it all in for coffee dates and “seeing where things go.” And if I’m being honest, I meet better looking, taller, and just as stable men on vanilla apps anyway… so what’s the incentive here?

Are any of you SBs looking for marriage-minded men? If so, what are your expectations? Do you treat these newer “SDs” like regular dates now, or still expect allowance? And why are they always so stunned when it’s brought up?

1mkbjgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mkbjgt/explore_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker_vinci_and/,Explore the Best Cold Brew Coffee Maker VINCI and Is It Worth It,"Nothing beats the excitement of discovering a gadget that caters to your caffeine cravings while saving time and effort. Owning the VINCI E23010 has brought a new level of convenience to my mornings. As someone who juggles work and running between commitments, this electric cold brew coffee maker has transformed a process that typically took hours into just minutes. The brand promises speed, user-friendliness, and consistency, and trust me—it delivers. That said, the product isn't without its quirks, but let’s dive into my experience with it.

**Design Meets Functionality**  
The design of this cold brew coffee maker is both modern and practical. Its sleek body, a blend of glass and black accents, looks fantastic on my kitchen counter. Compact enough to not hog space, it fits well even in smaller setups like a cozy apartment or an office coffee station. The glass carafe adds a touch of elegance, and it's sturdy enough to give you confidence that it won't chip with regular use. That said, the unit isn’t exactly featherlight, but it’s manageable. I particularly appreciate the intuitive user interface, equipped with a dial and buttons that make selecting options simple even early in the morning when I’m still half-asleep.

**Unparalleled Brew Speed**  
Cold brew coffee lovers know the waiting game—a solid 12 to 24 hours to achieve the right flavor profile. The VINCI E23010 crushes those norms with its express cold brew feature. Depending on your brew strength preference, you can have light cold brew ready in just 5 minutes, or go bolder with the extra bold setting at 25 minutes. Honestly, the first time I hit that “bold” option, I was skeptical. However, when the smooth, rich coffee hit my taste buds, I knew this wasn’t just clever marketing. A typical morning run for light brew and my evening pick-me-up for bold has become part of my routine.

[Check VINCI E23010 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b084l54spy/)

**User-Friendly Operations**  
Setting up the device for the first time didn't require a PhD in engineering. It came beautifully packaged and included everything I needed—from the brewing lids to the cleaning cup. The machine is fully automatic, and adjusting settings via the dial is straightforward. Whether you're an experienced coffee geek or someone who would consider instant coffee a masterpiece, getting the perfect brew out of this machine is an easy task. The built-in Circle Flow technology does the heavy lifting by brewing with optimal consistency, ensuring each cup is sediment-free and smooth. Within days, even my coworker, who usually shies away from kitchen gadgets, praised its simplicity.

**Strengths**  
- Multiple brew strength settings elevate customization.  
- Quick brewing times deliver flavorful coffee within minutes.  
- Circle Flow patented technology prevents sediment for clarity.  
- A glass carafe that’s brew-and-serve friendly enhances convenience.  

**Cleaning Made Hassle-Free**  
Cleaning coffee machines often becomes the Achilles’ heel of owning one. The added self-cleaning function made me fall even more in love with this machine. After emptying your brewed coffee, you pop in the cleaning cup, flush it with fresh water, and let it cycle through. The process is refreshingly fast and thorough, leaving no coffee residue or odd odors behind. The entire mechanism feels thoughtfully created for hygiene, a critical factor when you’re brewing day in and day out.

**Areas of Concern**  
- It’s slightly noisy during the brewing process, which could be disruptive in quieter settings.  
- The power cord could’ve been designed a bit longer for flexible counter placement.  
- While the glass carafe is elegant and functional, it might feel fragile to some users.  

**Competing Brands**  
Competitors in this segment include household names like OXO and Takeya. OXO offers a sleek drip-based cold brew coffee maker, ideal for traditionalists who don’t mind the wait times and prefer manual control. Takeya, on the other hand, presents a simpler, budget-friendly solution with its pitcher-style brewer, which works without electricity. What the VINCI E23010 brings to the table is speed and automation. The fact that you don’t need to babysit the brewing process is a win in itself. However, if you’re someone who appreciates minimalist, no-frills designs, Takeya could rival it in terms of portability and ease of storage. For those who crave barista-level control, OXO might appeal, although it lacks the efficiency the VINCI provides.

**Value for Money**  
One thing I often debate with myself when buying kitchen gadgets is whether they're worth the investment. The answer for this machine is a resounding yes—not just for me, but also in terms of its technology, versatility, and time-saving promise. Comparing it to manual cold brew makers, where you need to grind, wait, and strain, this device feels like it levels up the entire experience. Considering its robust performance and extra touches like the self-cleaning system, it brings immense value to coffee enthusiasts of all expertise levels.

But I digress, onto the review. I had the Pasta Pomodoro, but just like his mine suffered from pretty much all the same issues. Note the lovely solidified Pineapple beverage base, although with some warm water it was quite tasty, the coffee had suffered from compromised packaging and was unusable, which was disappointing I was hoping that It would be a premium South American coffee in there. 

Moving on to the badly oxidized apricots, just as brown and mushy as the ones in Waffles meal. I suppose if was hungry enough they would be filling, but I still don't think they'd be tasty... The other fruit component was a mixed berry, and it had definitely suffered oxidation plus it had its share of pits. 

Both of these had they been fresh would have been great with the English translated ""Big Cracker"" 😀 Which was despite being well sealed with a Steve1989 approved. ""Nice hiss"" had started the oxidation process as well. These are kind of a heavy bread/cake with a nice chewiness sweet nutty like flavor.

*By Sarah Al-Mansoori, Dubai Interior Enthusiast*

When I moved into my new Dubai Marina apartment, I knew I needed a sofa that matched the elegance of my space—something luxurious, timeless, and impeccably crafted. After searching for **“luxury furniture in Dubai”**, I discovered [**Purity.ae**](http://Purity.ae), a high-end showroom offering **bespoke Italian brands in UAE**. Here’s my firsthand experience shopping with them.

# Why I Chose [**Purity.ae**](http://Purity.ae)

As someone who values quality, I wanted:  
✔ **Authentic Italian craftsmanship** – No mass-produced pieces.  
✔ **Customization options** – Tailored to my apartment’s aesthetic.  
✔ **Expert design advice** – Because buying luxury furniture is an investment.

[Purity.ae](http://Purity.ae) stood out with their **exclusive collections from brands like Poltrona Frau, B&B Italia, and Flexform**—names I’d only seen in Milan design magazines.

# My Sofa Selection Process

# 1. The Showroom Visit (A Sensory Delight)

Walking into their Dubai showroom felt like stepping into a Milan design studio. Every piece was curated—plush **Italian leather sofas**, sleek **modern sectionals**, and even **luxury kitchens in Dubai** displays.

**What I loved:**

* **Personalized service** – A consultant asked about my space, lifestyle, and preferences.
* **Fabric & leather swatches** – I could touch and compare materials.
* **3D room visualization** – They helped me imagine the sofa in my apartment.

# 2. Choosing the Perfect Sofa

I was torn between:

* A **deep-seated B&B Italia sectional** (perfect for hosting).
* A **sleek Minotti leather sofa** (more formal and elegant).

Their designer helped me decide based on:  
✔ **My apartment’s open layout** (went with the sectional).  
✔ **Durability for Dubai’s climate** (chose a **high-performance fabric**).  
✔ **Custom leg finishes** (opted for brushed brass).

# 3. Delivery & Setup (Flawless!)

* **White-glove delivery** – They handled everything, including assembly.
* **Protective packaging** – No scratches or damage.
* **Final styling tips** – Their team even suggested a **matching coffee table**.

# Final Thoughts: Was It Worth It?

**Absolutely.** A year later, my sofa still looks and feels brand new. Friends and family constantly compliment it, and I’ve since returned for a **custom dining table**.

# Why I Recommend Purity.ae:

✅ **Real luxury brands** (no knockoffs).  
✅ **Tailored design advice** (they listen!).  
✅ **Hassle-free delivery** (a must in Dubai).

If you’re searching for **luxury furniture in Dubai/UAE**, skip the generic stores and visit [**Purity.ae**](https://purity.ae/). Trust me—it’s worth every dirham.

1mkbgwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LessNoiseMoreSignal/comments/1mkbgwq/the_archaeology_of_wonder/,The Archaeology of Wonder.,"It’s any wonder that wonder itself is on the decline. With the perpetual bad news, persistent bad leadership, detrimental policies whether through incompetence or by design. It all wears down on the soul with barely a glimpse of light at the end of a long dark tunnel.

Yet perhaps this erosion of wonder is itself a kind of revelation, not the mystical sort we once craved, but something more quotidian and therefore more devastating. We have become archaeologists of our own despair, sifting through the digital sediment of each day’s catastrophes with the methodical precision of those who have given up hope of finding anything whole. The news arrives in fragments: a child’s shoe on a beach, a politician’s lie delivered with the casual brutality of someone ordering coffee, the slow-motion collapse of institutions that once seemed as permanent as mountains.

In the suburbs of our collective unconscious, the American dream has become a recurring nightmare, playing on loop in the fluorescent-lit waiting rooms of our discontent. We scroll through feeds that feed on nothing, consuming content that leaves us emptier than before, our thumbs moving with the mechanical persistence of prayer wheels operated by people who have forgotten what they’re praying for. The algorithms know us better than we know ourselves, serving up perfectly calibrated doses of outrage and validation, keeping us just angry enough to stay engaged, just hopeful enough to keep consuming.

But wonder, that most fragile of human faculties, requires something algorithms cannot provide: the capacity to be surprised by grace. It demands we slow down enough to notice the way light falls across a stranger’s face in the subway, the inexplicable kindness of someone who stops to help when they don’t have to, the small daily resurrections that occur when we choose love over fear, connection over isolation, curiosity over certainty.

The tunnel is long and dark, yes. But tunnels are human constructions, and what humans build, they can also choose to leave behind. Sometimes the light at the end isn’t a destination but a doorway, an invitation to step outside the narrow corridors of our own making and discover that wonder was never really in decline. We were just looking for it in all the wrong places, expecting it to arrive with fanfare when it has always preferred to whisper.",1,1754599365.0,LessNoiseMoreSignal,0,1.0,False
1mkbfnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1mkbfnp/bags_that_have_giant_and_useful_external_water/,Bags that have giant (and useful) external water bottle pockets?,"So I prefer having external bottle pockets on my bags (the non enclosed with drainage holes kind) since they're useful for a variety of carry (water + coffee, bottle + (wet) umbrella, totally random ""just need to stuff it somewhere but my internal space is packed out"") without necessarily having to take up internal space.

My all time favorite implementation of external pockets that I haven't really seen on any other bag ever are the ones from a now defunct bag/accessory maker called Koala Gear.  Their bags are the Joey (25L \~ 40L) and the Jay (18L).  They have these extra large mesh panels on both sides, that can be accessed from either the top or the back panel side.  Not only are these pockets extremely large, stretchy and can fit a WHOLE lot of stuff (I can fit a 1L Nalgene + 1L Yeti into a single pocket if I wanted to in the Joey), my favorite feature was the front side accessibility without having to remove the backpack from your back.  Here's what they look like (from their old kickstarter pages):

[On the larger Joey](https://i.redd.it/wmyick0vmnhf1.gif)

[On the smaller Jay](https://preview.redd.it/o6kgxj7vsnhf1.jpg?width=667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61a9b8ab0ab2598c90c8b04b09f857ad8eba46d4)

According to their descriptions, the Joey uses ""powermesh"" and the Jay uses some ""omni-stretch elastic twill"".  IMO I feel like more bags could use this type of material for external carry, but I get that probably not everybody is a fan of it, either functionally over time, or just aesthetically.

Are there any bags currently out there that have similarly extra large elastic mesh/fabric pockets and can be utilized in a similar fashion?  The closest I can think of would probably be the ULA Dragonfly with their extra large mesh pockets, except they are only accessible from the top which still requires taking the backpack off or at the very least swinging it around on one shoulder.",3,1754599286.0,ManyBaggers,1,1.0,False

I've been writing 'fan fiction' around my Football Manager save since January, and this is the latest instalment.

**I hope you enjoy.**

*Six signings, one trophy, and the January arrival of Wilfried Gnonto — the unexpected key that unlocked the tactical box*

*Florence, January 2026.*

The window slammed shut at one minute to midnight on the second day of February. The transfer window was closed. The next morning, February 3^(rd), a window quite literally slammed, in Owl Foxtrot’s office. The actual window, the one at the back of the Viola Park training complex, overlooking the empty goalposts and overcoached grass, physically banged into the frame and for the umpteenth time this winter almost, *almost,* shattered. The wind off the Arno had been growing all day, as ever making this particular part of Tuscany feel about 2 degrees colder than anywhere else. A pulsing, inland thing. Not hostile exactly, just insistent. Like many of the thoughts that refuse to leave Owl Foxtrot’s head on a daily basis.

But there, at the desk and outside of his internal monologue and very much part of the real, external world, Owl didn’t even flinch. Didn’t look up from his notepad, where “433!?!?”, “Vella, up from U20?” and “Serge Kingue = Monchu?” were scribbled in neat black biro. Each thought, each rumination, contained in a carefully drawn blue biro box. His thermos hissed beside him. He sipped coffee, an unusual fourth of the day. Owl Foxtrot was a man of habit, but not rigid in it. Usually three cups, usually between 6am and midday. But today, well, it wasn’t a normal day. So four cups. It hit the spot. A manager of rare intensity, rare calm. He was teetotal, vegan, methodical, and emotionally - most days, at least - held together by 45 minutes of yoga and the ongoing companionship of his crossword streak, and the everlasting joy of the sounds of his son running along the corridor or laughing in the garden.

As with almost every day, Owl found that he wasn’t alone for long.

A voice arrived before the man did, as it always did. It rolled into the room like thunder, part-Spanish, part-Italian, part-tobaccoed laughter. Ángel Russo didn’t knock. Never knocked. He simply arrived. Still wearing his training coat, smelling of grass, sweat and cloves, lips curling around a roll-up an ever present roll-up. Owl looked up. Raised an eyebrow.

“Did we do enough?” Owl asked, in the tone of someone who already knew the answer but wanted to hear it from a man with more faith in chaos.

Ángel shrugged, grinned. “More than enough, Owl. We signed the future. We defended the now. And we didn’t waste a single Euro on a player we’d regret.”

Owl nodded. “You sound like you’ve been preparing that line all day.”

“I have,” Ángel said, slumping into the threadbare armchair. “And it gets better as I drink more!”

It had been a long month.

The fixture list had read like some sort of graphic novel, like some sort of epic battle sequence: Napoli, Napoli, Juventus, Juventus, Udinese, Atalanta. Seven games. Nineteen days. There had been a Supercoppa. A Coppa Italia quarter-final. A place in the league’s top three to defend. And amid all of that, there had been transfer dealings of surgical precision and manic improvisation. Sometimes both in the same hour.

The first to go were all planned and all in the first three days of January. Two old heads, no longer cut out for the style of play or the Serie A – Matip to Kieve, Biraghi to Portsmouth. The third, Charles De Ketelaere – a thorn in Owl’s side since his first day Viola Park, mercurial, a complainer, too much self-confidence and not enough product. In short, a problem. But now Nante’s problem. Good riddance.

The came the bolt from the blue. Monchu. Wanted by Real Madrid, the hungry giant of Spain, snapping up, chewing up and spitting out talent faster than it could digest. But, money talks and so Monchu walked. He took his time, he made Madrid wait and he made Owl and Angel wait. The bid came in on January 9^(th), and Monchu didn’t touch down in Spain until January 19^(th). Owl handled all the calls with Madrid, and with Monchu, himself. Not because he didn’t trust Ángel - he did, entirely. No, it was because there was something sacred in the moment a player leaves like Monchu leaves. He had grown into the spine of this team like ivy on stone. Thirty-five million wasn’t a goodbye. It was a bet. The kind Owl didn’t like making lightly. But there was a clarity to the moment. And when it was done, there was just space. Space to fill, and not a lot of time to fill it.

Ángel, of course, wanted to fill it. But he also wanted to use the opportunity to develop as a squad, a team, a club, *a partnership.*

They spoke about 433. About 343. About a shape Owl referred to only as “the accordion.” They even joked about bringing in a grizzled veteran to bark at the midfield for six months, but Steven Nzonzi had retired and was apparently writing a book, and Marten de Roon had lost half a yard of pace and was now being left behind by Eredivisie midfielders.

So instead they went younger. Braver. And they looked further back down the pitch.

Strahinja Pavlović was the first piece to arrive, a day after Monchu had gone. 24 years old. Serbian steel. Centre back. No-nonsense, but also with the ability to play. From Juventus, no less, who let him go like they hadn’t seen what was coming. Owl and Ángel had. They’d watched him, charted him, remembered him from the youth systems, remembered the way he played alongside Jevremović back when neither had passports filled with stamps or reputations filled with whispers. It was a homecoming of sorts. One game together - the Supercoppa Final - and already there was a telepathy. Serbian shortwave frequency. Owl barely said a word at half-time in that game. Didn’t need to.

The Supercoppa was lifted under cool stars and indifferent applause, the kind that exists when a trophy matters only because you choose to make it matter. But it mattered to them. It was a beginning.

There was quiet for 10 days after Pavlović arrived. Well, it appeared quiet to the media and the fans. There was no transfer talk in the air. All was quiet at Viola Park. But it wasn’t. Owl and Ángel were working through their contacts and had decided between them that there wasn’t going to be a big money signing. There wasn’t going to be a direct replacement for Monchu. The team didn’t need it. They had depth, they had quality. They had the trust of each other, and of a man from England who quietly hooted and a man from Venezuela who didn’t appear to have a volume control.

Between January 20^(th) and January 25^(th) three more landed in Florence, quiet and unassuming. In came an unknown 25 year old Brazilian, by the name of Antonio Augusto on a Free Transfer. Playing both left and right back, equally strong left and right foot. Remarkable numbers, frankly remarkably no competition for his signature. Then came a 19 year old keeper from Rosenborg who Owl had been watching grow since his days managing Stevenage. £3,800,000, rising to 4.8 after certain conditions. The replacement for Luigi Sepe, the injury prone 33 year old back-up and almost as good as Jevremović. Good business. Future planning. Finally, in came Jimi Taurianinen from Chelsea. At 23 there was still a chance for him, he just needed someone to give it to him. At £375,000 it would have been criminal for the chance not to have been offered.

Then, a pause. Silence for a day.

Then came Gnonto.

Owl still wasn’t sure how Ángel had done it. Somehow, between texts and voice notes and a train ride to Rome and a breakfast meeting in Milan with someone neither of them liked, Ángel had pulled it off.

Wilfried Gnonto. 22. Born in Verbania, matured abroad, hardened at Villareal. But still Italian. Still local in the mythological sense. His arrival wasn’t so much a signing as a story slotting back into place. Owl didn’t allow himself sentiment very often, but watching Gnonto twist past a full-back in training, legs like pistons, grin like a boy in summer, even he had to admit it. There was something poetic about it. He wasn’t in any of his note pads, he wasn’t on any of his YouTube playlists all of a sudden he was just there.

“He’s the reason you’ll stay,” Ángel had muttered during Gnonto’s medical.

“I haven’t decided that,” Owl replied, though he already knew he had.

There were others, too.

Vella and Sens, the next generation. Plucked from the youth ranks, shielded from the circling interest of Serie A rivals all through January, thrown into training with the grown men as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Owl didn’t say much to them. Didn’t need to. They understood what it meant to be summoned in January, when the games came too fast and the squad too thin. Ángel, of course, became their uncle immediately. He shared stories about Polish away days and accidental ayahuasca trips in Ecuador, all of which may or may not have been true.

Then, on the final day, Serge Kingue.

A wildcard. 18 years old. Unknown to most. Picked from Saint-Étienne like a truffle dug in moonlight. Could be a ball-winner. Could be a box-to-box. Could be a dud. Owl didn’t care. There was something in the eyes. Something he recognised. Sometimes, you roll the dice just to hear them sing. In on a loan, 100% wages covered, until the end of the following season. If it worked, fantastic. If it didn’t, he’d at least help the U20s win something.

Through all of this wheeling and dealing, there were the games. So. Many. Games.

Napoli were brushed aside in the Coppa. Three days later, Napoli were suffocated in the Supercoppa, with Owl springing a surprise 3412 for the first time. Four days after that, Juventus lost a war in the Quarters and three after that they drew a truce in the league.

Take a breath. Or don’t.

Three days after Juve, Udinese visited the Artemio and were run over by tired legs and sharp minds. Then, finally, mercifully, Atalanta came to town and were taken apart so surgically it felt like something a medical board might need to review. Six wins. One draw. A trophy. A semi-final. And, come the morning of February 3rd second in the league, level on points with Roma, level on goal difference with Inter, and a game in hand on one and two to watch for the other.

Again, take a breath. Or don’t.

Two days later, they spent the night before the Inter semi-final in a trattoria in Milan. The same one Ángel insisted on visiting whenever they were in the city. Owl had his water. Ángel had something brown and burning. Inter fans jeered across the aisle. Ángel blew kisses. Owl asked for the bill.

“You should enjoy it more,” Ángel said, tearing a piece of bread in half and offering it across the table like communion.

“I enjoy the work,” Owl replied.

“And this is not work?”

“No. This is the moment before the work begins.”

They sat in silence for a while. Owl’s phone buzzed. Sens was showing growth, beginning to swagger in the U20s. His time in the big league was coming. Ángel checked the league table again, like it might have changed in the last ten minutes.

“You still thinking about the 433?” he asked.

“I’m always thinking about the 433,” Owl replied.

“You’re the only man I know who thinks in quadrants.”

Owl raised an eyebrow. “You’re still backing the 3-4-1-2?”

“With that back line? With Wilfried flying and Serge Kingue raring to go and seemingly ready to learn fast? Absolutely. And if not, we open with the 4-4-2, shock them early, then slide into the groove.”

Owl nodded slowly. “Krzysztof and Gnonto up top. Kouamé just behind or out wide. Pedro creating and Pulgar dictating in the middle. Options. All good options.”

Ángel grinned.

“I told you. We’re cooking with fire.”

They toasted. To Florence, to bold ideas, to Vella and Sens both saying no to Milan and yes to La Viola.

The window had been frantic. Real Madrid snatching Monchu. Juventus folding under pressure twice in a week. Now, the Serie A table tighter than Owl’s jaw at a press conference. Roma top, Viola second, Inter lurking with two games in hand. Milan and Juve still there, or thereabouts.

It was anyone’s title.

I'm sensitive to more food than not now (Coffee, spicy food, tomatoes, and a lot more). It immediately or shortly after causes me extreme bloating/uncomfortable feeling in my left lower side abdomen and often in the middle pelvic region too. It feels like I swallowed a brick and its just sitting in there. This pressure/dull pain also causes me to need to urinate more often and I have urgency. I'm seriously so tired of feeling this way.

I went to an emergency ER location one night in December because the flare up was so bad. They did a CT of my abdomen and did not see anything on it and seemed kind of stumped. Blood results did not show anything out of the ordinary.

I have seen a Urologist because I thought it was bladder related initially (still not really sure). He did a cystoscopy of my bladder and all they saw was inflammation and also stated I may have IC. He prescribed me doxycycline and tadafil. I also did a blood test but nothing was abnormal. I have taken a full round of the doxy and it did not help. I read the tadafil had the chance of causing blindness so I have been hesitate to try it.

 I recently went to a Gastroenterologist and he ordered an x-ray and tested me for gluten intolerance (negative) and I ended up scheduling an endoscopy. The x-ray did not show anything. The result of the endoscopy was that I had inflammation and all of the biopsies came back with no concern. He made it seem like I just had acid reflux but this pain is literally in my lower abdomen and pelvic area. I have a follow up with him and want to have a colonoscopy done to see if it will show anything.

I'm just so tired of feeling this way every single day. I can't drink coffee or it triggers. It's ruining my quality of life. The thought of having to forever just not eat things that taste good sounds horrible.

Does this sound like diverticulitis or what any of y'all have experienced? Any help is appreciated.",5,1754598654.0,Diverticulitis,15,1.0,False

I've been writing 'fan fiction' around my Football Manager save since January, and this is the latest instalment. I have created two protagonists - the manager, Owl Foxtrot and his assistant Angel Russo. Russo is actually a new gen Director of Football and Foxtrot is the manager I play with on my save.**

**I have been writing fiction and non-fiction since I was a teenager across a range of subjects, and this is my first attempt at using a game to be the driver of a narrative. It has been surprisingly engaging and fun, and it has certainly added a level of immersion to my FM experience.**

**I hope you enjoy.**

*Six signings, one trophy, and the January arrival of Wilfried Gnonto — the unexpected key that unlocked the tactical box*

*Florence, January 2026.*

The window slammed shut at one minute to midnight on the second day of February. The transfer window was closed. The next morning, February 3^(rd), a window quite literally slammed, in Owl Foxtrot’s office. The actual window, the one at the back of the Viola Park training complex, overlooking the empty goalposts and overcoached grass, physically banged into the frame and for the umpteenth time this winter almost, *almost,* shattered. The wind off the Arno had been growing all day, as ever making this particular part of Tuscany feel about 2 degrees colder than anywhere else. A pulsing, inland thing. Not hostile exactly, just insistent. Like many of the thoughts that refuse to leave Owl Foxtrot’s head on a daily basis.

But there, at the desk and outside of his internal monologue and very much part of the real, external world, Owl didn’t even flinch. Didn’t look up from his notepad, where “433!?!?”, “Vella, up from U20?” and “Serge Kingue = Monchu?” were scribbled in neat black biro. Each thought, each rumination, contained in a carefully drawn blue biro box. His thermos hissed beside him. He sipped coffee, an unusual fourth of the day. Owl Foxtrot was a man of habit, but not rigid in it. Usually three cups, usually between 6am and midday. But today, well, it wasn’t a normal day. So four cups. It hit the spot. A manager of rare intensity, rare calm. He was teetotal, vegan, methodical, and emotionally - most days, at least - held together by 45 minutes of yoga and the ongoing companionship of his crossword streak, and the everlasting joy of the sounds of his son running along the corridor or laughing in the garden.

As with almost every day, Owl found that he wasn’t alone for long.

A voice arrived before the man did, as it always did. It rolled into the room like thunder, part-Spanish, part-Italian, part-tobaccoed laughter. Ángel Russo didn’t knock. Never knocked. He simply arrived. Still wearing his training coat, smelling of grass, sweat and cloves, lips curling around a roll-up an ever present roll-up. Owl looked up. Raised an eyebrow.

“Did we do enough?” Owl asked, in the tone of someone who already knew the answer but wanted to hear it from a man with more faith in chaos.

Ángel shrugged, grinned. “More than enough, Owl. We signed the future. We defended the now. And we didn’t waste a single Euro on a player we’d regret.”

Owl nodded. “You sound like you’ve been preparing that line all day.”

“I have,” Ángel said, slumping into the threadbare armchair. “And it gets better as I drink more!”

It had been a long month.

The fixture list had read like some sort of graphic novel, like some sort of epic battle sequence: Napoli, Napoli, Juventus, Juventus, Udinese, Atalanta. Seven games. Nineteen days. There had been a Supercoppa. A Coppa Italia quarter-final. A place in the league’s top three to defend. And amid all of that, there had been transfer dealings of surgical precision and manic improvisation. Sometimes both in the same hour.

The first to go were all planned and all in the first three days of January. Two old heads, no longer cut out for the style of play or the Serie A – Matip to Kieve, Biraghi to Portsmouth. The third, Charles De Ketelaere – a thorn in Owl’s side since his first day Viola Park, mercurial, a complainer, too much self-confidence and not enough product. In short, a problem. But now Nante’s problem. Good riddance.

The came the bolt from the blue. Monchu. Wanted by Real Madrid, the hungry giant of Spain, snapping up, chewing up and spitting out talent faster than it could digest. But, money talks and so Monchu walked. He took his time, he made Madrid wait and he made Owl and Angel wait. The bid came in on January 9^(th), and Monchu didn’t touch down in Spain until January 19^(th). Owl handled all the calls with Madrid, and with Monchu, himself. Not because he didn’t trust Ángel - he did, entirely. No, it was because there was something sacred in the moment a player leaves like Monchu leaves. He had grown into the spine of this team like ivy on stone. Thirty-five million wasn’t a goodbye. It was a bet. The kind Owl didn’t like making lightly. But there was a clarity to the moment. And when it was done, there was just space. Space to fill, and not a lot of time to fill it.

Ángel, of course, wanted to fill it. But he also wanted to use the opportunity to develop as a squad, a team, a club, *a partnership.*

They spoke about 433. About 343. About a shape Owl referred to only as “the accordion.” They even joked about bringing in a grizzled veteran to bark at the midfield for six months, but Steven Nzonzi had retired and was apparently writing a book, and Marten de Roon had lost half a yard of pace and was now being left behind by Eredivisie midfielders.

So instead they went younger. Braver. And they looked further back down the pitch.

Strahinja Pavlović was the first piece to arrive, a day after Monchu had gone. 24 years old. Serbian steel. Centre back. No-nonsense, but also with the ability to play. From Juventus, no less, who let him go like they hadn’t seen what was coming. Owl and Ángel had. They’d watched him, charted him, remembered him from the youth systems, remembered the way he played alongside Jevremović back when neither had passports filled with stamps or reputations filled with whispers. It was a homecoming of sorts. One game together - the Supercoppa Final - and already there was a telepathy. Serbian shortwave frequency. Owl barely said a word at half-time in that game. Didn’t need to.

The Supercoppa was lifted under cool stars and indifferent applause, the kind that exists when a trophy matters only because you choose to make it matter. But it mattered to them. It was a beginning.

There was quiet for 10 days after Pavlović arrived. Well, it appeared quiet to the media and the fans. There was no transfer talk in the air. All was quiet at Viola Park. But it wasn’t. Owl and Ángel were working through their contacts and had decided between them that there wasn’t going to be a big money signing. There wasn’t going to be a direct replacement for Monchu. The team didn’t need it. They had depth, they had quality. They had the trust of each other, and of a man from England who quietly hooted and a man from Venezuela who didn’t appear to have a volume control.

Between January 20^(th) and January 25^(th) three more landed in Florence, quiet and unassuming. In came an unknown 25 year old Brazilian, by the name of Antonio Augusto on a Free Transfer. Playing both left and right back, equally strong left and right foot. Remarkable numbers, frankly remarkably no competition for his signature. Then came a 19 year old keeper from Rosenborg who Owl had been watching grow since his days managing Stevenage. £3,800,000, rising to 4.8 after certain conditions. The replacement for Luigi Sepe, the injury prone 33 year old back-up and almost as good as Jevremović. Good business. Future planning. Finally, in came Jimi Taurianinen from Chelsea. At 23 there was still a chance for him, he just needed someone to give it to him. At £375,000 it would have been criminal for the chance not to have been offered.

Then, a pause. Silence for a day.

Then came Gnonto.

Owl still wasn’t sure how Ángel had done it. Somehow, between texts and voice notes and a train ride to Rome and a breakfast meeting in Milan with someone neither of them liked, Ángel had pulled it off.

Wilfried Gnonto. 22. Born in Verbania, matured abroad, hardened at Villareal. But still Italian. Still local in the mythological sense. His arrival wasn’t so much a signing as a story slotting back into place. Owl didn’t allow himself sentiment very often, but watching Gnonto twist past a full-back in training, legs like pistons, grin like a boy in summer, even he had to admit it. There was something poetic about it. He wasn’t in any of his note pads, he wasn’t on any of his YouTube playlists all of a sudden he was just there.

“He’s the reason you’ll stay,” Ángel had muttered during Gnonto’s medical.

“I haven’t decided that,” Owl replied, though he already knew he had.

There were others, too.

Vella and Sens, the next generation. Plucked from the youth ranks, shielded from the circling interest of Serie A rivals all through January, thrown into training with the grown men as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Owl didn’t say much to them. Didn’t need to. They understood what it meant to be summoned in January, when the games came too fast and the squad too thin. Ángel, of course, became their uncle immediately. He shared stories about Polish away days and accidental ayahuasca trips in Ecuador, all of which may or may not have been true.

Then, on the final day, Serge Kingue.

A wildcard. 18 years old. Unknown to most. Picked from Saint-Étienne like a truffle dug in moonlight. Could be a ball-winner. Could be a box-to-box. Could be a dud. Owl didn’t care. There was something in the eyes. Something he recognised. Sometimes, you roll the dice just to hear them sing. In on a loan, 100% wages covered, until the end of the following season. If it worked, fantastic. If it didn’t, he’d at least help the U20s win something.

Through all of this wheeling and dealing, there were the games. So. Many. Games.

Napoli were brushed aside in the Coppa. Three days later, Napoli were suffocated in the Supercoppa, with Owl springing a surprise 3412 for the first time. Four days after that, Juventus lost a war in the Quarters and three after that they drew a truce in the league.

Take a breath. Or don’t.

Three days after Juve, Udinese visited the Artemio and were run over by tired legs and sharp minds. Then, finally, mercifully, Atalanta came to town and were taken apart so surgically it felt like something a medical board might need to review. Six wins. One draw. A trophy. A semi-final. And, come the morning of February 3rd second in the league, level on points with Roma, level on goal difference with Inter, and a game in hand on one and two to watch for the other.

Again, take a breath. Or don’t.

Two days later, they spent the night before the Inter semi-final in a trattoria in Milan. The same one Ángel insisted on visiting whenever they were in the city. Owl had his water. Ángel had something brown and burning. Inter fans jeered across the aisle. Ángel blew kisses. Owl asked for the bill.

“You should enjoy it more,” Ángel said, tearing a piece of bread in half and offering it across the table like communion.

“I enjoy the work,” Owl replied.

“And this is not work?”

“No. This is the moment before the work begins.”

They sat in silence for a while. Owl’s phone buzzed. Sens was showing growth, beginning to swagger in the U20s. His time in the big league was coming. Ángel checked the league table again, like it might have changed in the last ten minutes.

“You still thinking about the 433?” he asked.

“I’m always thinking about the 433,” Owl replied.

“You’re the only man I know who thinks in quadrants.”

Owl raised an eyebrow. “You’re still backing the 3-4-1-2?”

“With that back line? With Wilfried flying and Serge Kingue raring to go and seemingly ready to learn fast? Absolutely. And if not, we open with the 4-4-2, shock them early, then slide into the groove.”

Owl nodded slowly. “Krzysztof and Gnonto up top. Kouamé just behind or out wide. Pedro creating and Pulgar dictating in the middle. Options. All good options.”

Ángel grinned. 

“I told you. We’re cooking with fire.”

They toasted. To Florence, to bold ideas, to Vella and Sens both saying no to Milan and yes to La Viola.

The window had been frantic. Real Madrid snatching Monchu. Juventus folding under pressure twice in a week. Now, the Serie A table tighter than Owl’s jaw at a press conference. Roma top, Viola second, Inter lurking with two games in hand. Milan and Juve still there, or thereabouts.

It was anyone’s title.

1mkb3j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mkb3j4/delve_into_the_best_electric_kettle_oxo_brew/,Delve Into the Best Electric Kettle OXO Brew Worth the Hype,"Using the OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Kettle on a daily basis feels like having a personal assistant for my tea, coffee, and instant meal needs. This electric kettle elegantly combines style with practicality, offering a versatile way to prepare hot beverages and more. The first thing that caught my attention was the seamless design and the durable borosilicate glass body, allowing me to watch the entire boiling process. It’s a small detail, but one that I’ve learned to appreciate far more than I thought I would.

**Design and Functionality at its Best**  
The polished glass exterior, combined with the BPA-free build, makes this kettle not just pleasing to look at but also safe to use. Its sleek design blends effortlessly with my modern kitchen décor, while the clear glass feature gives me real-time visibility of the water level and boiling stage. The non-slip handle stayed cool to the touch, even during extended use, and provided a great grip – which is helpful, especially when my hands are wet from washing dishes. Oh, and the ounce and milliliter markings? Beyond convenient. I never got something as simple as measurements so wrong before on other kettles, but that’s definitely a problem of the past.

**Precise Temperature Control and Convenience**  
What makes this kettle stand out is its temperature range adjustment feature. I could manually select any temperature between 170 °F to 212 °F on the backlit LED display using one simple dial. Trust me, I’ve used kettles without such precision, and I never knew how much of a game-changer it could be until I used this one. Whether I was heating water for herbal tea (which requires a lower temp) or getting water ready for a speedy coffee, it delivered consistent results. Plus, the 30-minute hold function was a lifesaver. I’ve often been distracted while waiting for the water to heat, but this function kept it warm until I could attend to it.

[Check OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Kettle price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b01ktrdknw/)  

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**  
The cord-free design made portability blissful—no need to awkwardly unplug or wrestle with wires every time I wanted to pour. I could remove it from the 360-degree swivel base with ease, walk over to the dining table, and pour multiple cups without hassle. Something else worth mentioning is the stainless steel filter. It not only looked quite refined but also prevented any particles from sneaking into my drink. Cleaning the removable filter was straightforward, a massive improvement from other kettles I have owned that had fixed screens. Even the slow-opening lid thoughtfully controlled the steam release, which prevented accidental splashes or burns.  

**Speed That Doesn’t Compromise Safety**  
For someone who’s always running on tight schedules in the morning, the speed of this kettle was satisfying. It boiled water faster than my microwave, ticking off another annoyance I had with my previous appliances. While being quick, it never made me feel like it sacrificed safety. The sturdy construction, thermal shock protection, and secure lid gave me peace of mind while operating it daily. I could leave it running, knowing the sturdy materials could handle the heat without issue.

**Merits**  
- The precise temperature control makes it adaptable for different kinds of brews.  
- A stay-warm feature prolongs the optimal temperature for convenience.  
- Durable borosilicate glass withstands thermal shock and offers visibility.  
- The cordless design enhances portability and ease of use.  

**Pitfalls**  
- The water capacity, while sufficient for most tasks, might seem limited for larger groups.  
- The glass body, though stylish, requires extra care to avoid accidental damage.  

**Challengers**  
I’ve compared similar products like the Breville Smart Kettle and Cuisinart PerfecTemp. While these are powerful competitors offering comparable temperature control and safety features, I found certain aspects of the OXO Brew kettle more efficient. For instance, its unique combination of a durable, transparent body and simple control dial made it more intuitive than Breville’s button-heavy interface. However, Breville did have a slight edge in water capacity, which could be a drawback here. Cuisinart’s kettle, on the other hand, had stronger performance for brewing larger quantities but lacked the clean, modern design aesthetic.  

**Value for Money**  
The value proposition of this kettle seemed clear after just a week of use. Its combination of speed, safety, and precision far outweighed the minor downsides, like being cautious with the glass or the slightly smaller volume. Considering its durable build and practical features, I felt it justified its cost well. It’s one of those rare appliances where affordability meets quality without feeling like a compromise.

She just kept asking who ate the most over and over so I said ""mum made you eggs last night if you are hungery"" and my mum replied to my sisters persistence with ""i dont think anyone was keeping track except mabey you"" the conversation was getting tense so in an attempt to diffuse the situation I took responsibility by saying in a somewhat sarcastic tone ""i definitely ate the most, i cramed as much fat f*ck in there as possible"" and my sister simply agreed and believed it by saying something like ""i bet you did"" (over the past year and a half i have lost 40 lbs, im really proud of the progress I've made through smaller portions and regular cardio) she then walked away saying I need to shower before work.

 After cleaning the kitchen, wiping down counters, coffee stains ect, I went out for cigarette to scroll on tictok, 7-10 mins later my sister in a towel pokes her head out the back door and asked me to come in so she could apologize for assuming/accusing me of eating all the food in the house. She clearly just got out of the shower dripping water all over the house, I tried to suggest she put some clothes so I can finish my cigarette and talk properly. She flat out says ""no come inside so I can apologize to you  infront of mom, I read somewhere it's better this way"" I tried to suggest she get dressed one more time before her saying ""this will be easier since I feel more vulnerable"" I just decided to stfu and follow her upstairs, she opens my mums office while she is on a work call (both my parents work from home) she says her apologie and without time for a response says ""ok now i need to get ready"" as we're walking she looks at me so I tell her ""that apology did not feel like it was for me"" if anything it was for her or our mum, it did not feel sincere.

1mkaztq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mkaztq/should_the_best_singleserve_espresso_machine_be/,Should the best single-serve espresso machine be the Nespresso Pixie,"The Nespresso EN127BL Pixie Espresso Machine by De'Longhi has taken a permanent spot on my kitchen counter since I started using it. As someone who genuinely appreciates a good cup of coffee, I was eager to test this compact yet stylish espresso machine. Its dark blue hue and polished design immediately add a touch of sophistication to any space, while its compact size is perfect for small kitchens or even office setups. From my experience, this coffee maker lives up to the hype, though there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Innovative Design and Build Quality**

One of the standout features of this espresso machine is its industrial-inspired design. The hammered metal side panels and the solid steel handle caught my eye immediately. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate a machine that combines functionality with aesthetics. Measuring just 12.76 inches in depth, 4.6 inches in width, and 9.25 inches in height, it occupies minimal counter space. Despite its compact footprint, it feels sturdy and well-made, which is a refreshing change from some of the flimsier models I’ve used in the past.

**Fast Heat-Up and Effortless Brewing**

I was genuinely impressed by how quickly this espresso machine heats up. After pressing the button, it's ready to brew in no time at all—a lifesaver during busy mornings. The 19-bar pressure system ensures each coffee capsule gets fully utilized to extract the maximum flavor. From espressos to lungos, the brewing process is quick and consistent. There’s a certain satisfaction in pressing a button and seeing perfect crema form on top of your coffee. It’s ideal for anyone who values both speed and quality in their coffee routine.

**Functional Features and Convenience**

This machine isn’t overloaded with features, but it does offer the essentials for a quality cup of coffee. With only two buttons, Espresso and Lungo, the Nespresso Pixie keeps things simple. The capsule system is delightfully mess-free; I no longer dread cleaning up coffee grounds early in the morning. Additionally, the descaling warning light has proven to be a useful reminder, ensuring the machine remains in optimal shape. The automatic power-off feature after two minutes of inactivity has not only saved electricity but also provided peace of mind on those rushed mornings when I’ve dashed out the door and forgotten to turn it off.

**Pluses**

- Quick heat-up system that delivers coffee in seconds  
- Compact and stylish industrial design suitable for small spaces  
- Seamless operation with minimal buttons for ease of use  

**Bad Points**

- Limited to Nespresso Original capsules, which can feel restrictive  
- The water tank is relatively small, requiring frequent refills  

**Coffee Quality and Experience**

When it comes to coffee, this machine delivers in spades. Every cup I’ve brewed has been impressively aromatic, with a bold flavor profile that’s hard to fault. The 19-bar pump ensures that every capsule is evenly extracted, maximizing the blend’s potential. My friends and family have often commented on how professional the coffee tastes, and they’ve started calling my house a “mini café!” The downside, however, is that it’s confined to using Nespresso Original capsules. While the range is decent, coffee purists might miss the flexibility of being able to use their own coffee blends.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other compact espresso machines, like the Keurig K-Cafe or the Breville Bambino Plus, the Pixie has its own pros and cons. The Keurig is more versatile with its pod selections but lacks the 19-bar pump, which affects the espresso’s richness. On the other hand, the Breville Bambino Plus delivers barista-level quality but is bulkier and comes with a learning curve. The Pixie strikes a nice middle ground, offering simplicity and reliable performance in a small, stylish package.

**Quality for Price**

Given its features and the premium coffee quality it produces, I’d say this machine offers great value for what it delivers. It’s not the cheapest espresso maker out there, but the build quality and results justify the cost. The fact that it’s semi-automatic and incredibly easy to use will appeal to coffee enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Although the capsule-based system locks you into buying Nespresso pods, the convenience might be worth it for some.

Going through the most severe depressive episode I've experienced since the traumatic events and I am isolated and alone. Hoping this reaches someone who is willing to listen,"Hi, I'm trying to be very cautious making this post because seeking support on reddit has previously led to being insulted and resulted in even greater self-hatred and depression than I was initially dealing with. I am not sure what community to post this in, but I was previously diagnosed with cptsd and I do believe that my trauma history and the environment I was raised in is the main underlying cause of my depression.

I would like to share some background. I'm in my mid 20's, and I work as a clinician in the mental health field, currently in a psychiatric emergency room in a hospital. This has been causing me to be severely stressed recently, working 12 hour shifts and, more importantly, realizing what a joke the psychiatric machine can be. The doctors are frequently invalidating and straight up dehumanizing to our patients. I am often powerless to the system, despite my best efforts to help people, a lot of times I watch patients going through similar struggles to what I'm going through myself, be dismissed and let down by the decision makers. Sometimes I get to provide comfort and support to patients though, despite not being a therapist (yet) or a doctor myself, and that really is why I do it. 

I can't get insurance benefits until January of 2025. It's a long and complicated story, but basically I missed open enrollment, for convoluted reasons. So I haven't been able to get counseling or medication management for my mental health, which I desperately need. 

  
On my days off, like today, I spend the day in bed, doing nothing. My eyelids feel droopy and heavy all day. It feels like my body is so heavy that it physically hurts to move. I'll try to do something, eventually fall to the floor, sob, and go back to bed. I'll sleep for 14 hours straight. I'll avoid talking to anyone, or doing anything. Not that I want to be like this, but because I feel unable to engage in anything or with anyone when I'm not contractually obligated to. 

 I recently moved to a new city, and I was hoping that the fresh start would give me a boost of motivation and help shake me out of the depression, and it did, for like a month. Then I got settled in my job, and the fatigue set in. Since then, I've been in what I'm calling ""self-exile"". I don't have any friends here, and I gave up trying to make them. Last week I made plans to go out for coffee with someone from a dating app tomorrow, and I have absolutely no motivation to go-- I'll probably cancel because of this feeling. At the same time, I recognize that I \*need\* community. I hate that the psychiatric machine has commodified our human need for community. That probably doesn't make sense and I can't really explain it coherently right now. 

  
But basically, today, I feel like I can't do anything. And I've tried. Attempts to shower resulted in sitting on the floor for an hour and then crying because ""I can't do it,"". I need someone to care about me. I don't know how to explain it, I'm not suicidal, but I don't also see any point in actually living without loved ones. I want a mother  or a friend to come in and tell me she loves me and help me clean my apartment. 

  
I'm living in rot. I've thought about maybe hiring someone to help me clean, but it's so humiliating. and i don't think I can talk to anyone right now. I feel so guilty for wasting beautiful sunny days, and at the same time the thought of going outside right now just seems like too much work. I feel guilty for not cleaning, my apartment is horrendous and the only days I'd be able to clean are on my days off, but I always seem to go into freeze mode when I'm off work like today and tomorrow. 

  
Things have been getting progressively worse for the past two years. The only other time I experienced this was when I was being abused. And at that point I believe it was a response to what I was going through, my brain trying to protect me. Now I think I'm just burnt out on life. I feel lost. I think this would improve if I had community, but I also feel like it's my fault for not having it. ",6,1754597965.0,CPTSD,10,1.0,False

# Seven Games, Nineteen Days

*Six signings, one trophy, and the January arrival of Wilfried Gnonto — the unexpected key that unlocked the tactical box*

*Florence, January 2026.*

The window slammed shut at one minute to midnight on the second day of February. The transfer window was closed. The next morning, February 3^(rd), a window quite literally slammed, in Owl Foxtrot’s office. The actual window, the one at the back of the Viola Park training complex, overlooking the empty goalposts and overcoached grass, physically banged into the frame and for the umpteenth time this winter almost, *almost,* shattered. The wind off the Arno had been growing all day, as ever making this particular part of Tuscany feel about 2 degrees colder than anywhere else. A pulsing, inland thing. Not hostile exactly, just insistent. Like many of the thoughts that refuse to leave Owl Foxtrot’s head on a daily basis.

But there, at the desk and outside of his internal monologue and very much part of the real, external world, Owl didn’t even flinch. Didn’t look up from his notepad, where “433!?!?”, “Vella, up from U20?” and “Serge Kingue = Monchu?” were scribbled in neat black biro. Each thought, each rumination, contained in a carefully drawn blue biro box. His thermos hissed beside him. He sipped coffee, an unusual fourth of the day. Owl Foxtrot was a man of habit, but not rigid in it. Usually three cups, usually between 6am and midday. But today, well, it wasn’t a normal day. So four cups. It hit the spot. A manager of rare intensity, rare calm. He was teetotal, vegan, methodical, and emotionally - most days, at least - held together by 45 minutes of yoga and the ongoing companionship of his crossword streak, and the everlasting joy of the sounds of his son running along the corridor or laughing in the garden.

As with almost every day, Owl found that he wasn’t alone for long.

A voice arrived before the man did, as it always did. It rolled into the room like thunder, part-Spanish, part-Italian, part-tobaccoed laughter. Ángel Russo didn’t knock. Never knocked. He simply arrived. Still wearing his training coat, smelling of grass, sweat and cloves, lips curling around a roll-up an ever present roll-up. Owl looked up. Raised an eyebrow.

“Did we do enough?” Owl asked, in the tone of someone who already knew the answer but wanted to hear it from a man with more faith in chaos.

Ángel shrugged, grinned. “More than enough, Owl. We signed the future. We defended the now. And we didn’t waste a single Euro on a player we’d regret.”

Owl nodded. “You sound like you’ve been preparing that line all day.”

“I have,” Ángel said, slumping into the threadbare armchair. “And it gets better as I drink more!”

It had been a long month.

The fixture list had read like some sort of graphic novel, like some sort of epic battle sequence: Napoli, Napoli, Juventus, Juventus, Udinese, Atalanta. Seven games. Nineteen days. There had been a Supercoppa. A Coppa Italia quarter-final. A place in the league’s top three to defend. And amid all of that, there had been transfer dealings of surgical precision and manic improvisation. Sometimes both in the same hour.

The first to go were all planned and all in the first three days of January. Two old heads, no longer cut out for the style of play or the Serie A – Matip to Kieve, Biraghi to Portsmouth. The third, Charles De Ketelaere – a thorn in Owl’s side since his first day Viola Park, mercurial, a complainer, too much self-confidence and not enough product. In short, a problem. But now Nante’s problem. Good riddance.

The came the bolt from the blue. Monchu. Wanted by Real Madrid, the hungry giant of Spain, snapping up, chewing up and spitting out talent faster than it could digest. But, money talks and so Monchu walked. He took his time, he made Madrid wait and he made Owl and Angel wait. The bid came in on January 9^(th), and Monchu didn’t touch down in Spain until January 19^(th). Owl handled all the calls with Madrid, and with Monchu, himself. Not because he didn’t trust Ángel - he did, entirely. No, it was because there was something sacred in the moment a player leaves like Monchu leaves. He had grown into the spine of this team like ivy on stone. Thirty-five million wasn’t a goodbye. It was a bet. The kind Owl didn’t like making lightly. But there was a clarity to the moment. And when it was done, there was just space. Space to fill, and not a lot of time to fill it.

Ángel, of course, wanted to fill it. But he also wanted to use the opportunity to develop as a squad, a team, a club, *a partnership.*

They spoke about 433. About 343. About a shape Owl referred to only as “the accordion.” They even joked about bringing in a grizzled veteran to bark at the midfield for six months, but Steven Nzonzi had retired and was apparently writing a book, and Marten de Roon had lost half a yard of pace and was now being left behind by Eredivisie midfielders.

So instead they went younger. Braver. And they looked further back down the pitch.

Strahinja Pavlović was the first piece to arrive, a day after Monchu had gone. 24 years old. Serbian steel. Centre back. No-nonsense, but also with the ability to play. From Juventus, no less, who let him go like they hadn’t seen what was coming. Owl and Ángel had. They’d watched him, charted him, remembered him from the youth systems, remembered the way he played alongside Jevremović back when neither had passports filled with stamps or reputations filled with whispers. It was a homecoming of sorts. One game together - the Supercoppa Final - and already there was a telepathy. Serbian shortwave frequency. Owl barely said a word at half-time in that game. Didn’t need to.

The Supercoppa was lifted under cool stars and indifferent applause, the kind that exists when a trophy matters only because you choose to make it matter. But it mattered to them. It was a beginning.

There was quiet for 10 days after Pavlović arrived. Well, it appeared quiet to the media and the fans. There was no transfer talk in the air. All was quiet at Viola Park. But it wasn’t. Owl and Ángel were working through their contacts and had decided between them that there wasn’t going to be a big money signing. There wasn’t going to be a direct replacement for Monchu. The team didn’t need it. They had depth, they had quality. They had the trust of each other, and of a man from England who quietly hooted and a man from Venezuela who didn’t appear to have a volume control.

Between January 20^(th) and January 25^(th) three more landed in Florence, quiet and unassuming. In came an unknown 25 year old Brazilian, by the name of Antonio Augusto on a Free Transfer. Playing both left and right back, equally strong left and right foot. Remarkable numbers, frankly remarkably no competition for his signature. Then came a 19 year old keeper from Rosenborg who Owl had been watching grow since his days managing Stevenage. £3,800,000, rising to 4.8 after certain conditions. The replacement for Luigi Sepe, the injury prone 33 year old back-up and almost as good as Jevremović. Good business. Future planning. Finally, in came Jimi Taurianinen from Chelsea. At 23 there was still a chance for him, he just needed someone to give it to him. At £375,000 it would have been criminal for the chance not to have been offered.

Then, a pause. Silence for a day.

Then came Gnonto.

Owl still wasn’t sure how Ángel had done it. Somehow, between texts and voice notes and a train ride to Rome and a breakfast meeting in Milan with someone neither of them liked, Ángel had pulled it off.

Wilfried Gnonto. 22. Born in Verbania, matured abroad, hardened at Villareal. But still Italian. Still local in the mythological sense. His arrival wasn’t so much a signing as a story slotting back into place. Owl didn’t allow himself sentiment very often, but watching Gnonto twist past a full-back in training, legs like pistons, grin like a boy in summer, even he had to admit it. There was something poetic about it. He wasn’t in any of his note pads, he wasn’t on any of his YouTube playlists all of a sudden he was just there.

“He’s the reason you’ll stay,” Ángel had muttered during Gnonto’s medical.

“I haven’t decided that,” Owl replied, though he already knew he had.

There were others, too.

Vella and Sens, the next generation. Plucked from the youth ranks, shielded from the circling interest of Serie A rivals all through January, thrown into training with the grown men as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Owl didn’t say much to them. Didn’t need to. They understood what it meant to be summoned in January, when the games came too fast and the squad too thin. Ángel, of course, became their uncle immediately. He shared stories about Polish away days and accidental ayahuasca trips in Ecuador, all of which may or may not have been true.

Then, on the final day, Serge Kingue.

A wildcard. 18 years old. Unknown to most. Picked from Saint-Étienne like a truffle dug in moonlight. Could be a ball-winner. Could be a box-to-box. Could be a dud. Owl didn’t care. There was something in the eyes. Something he recognised. Sometimes, you roll the dice just to hear them sing. In on a loan, 100% wages covered, until the end of the following season. If it worked, fantastic. If it didn’t, he’d at least help the U20s win something.

Through all of this wheeling and dealing, there were the games. So. Many. Games.

Napoli were brushed aside in the Coppa. Three days later, Napoli were suffocated in the Supercoppa, with Owl springing a surprise 3412 for the first time. Four days after that, Juventus lost a war in the Quarters and three after that they drew a truce in the league.

Take a breath. Or don’t.

Three days after Juve, Udinese visited the Artemio and were run over by tired legs and sharp minds. Then, finally, mercifully, Atalanta came to town and were taken apart so surgically it felt like something a medical board might need to review. Six wins. One draw. A trophy. A semi-final. And, come the morning of February 3rd second in the league, level on points with Roma, level on goal difference with Inter, and a game in hand on one and two to watch for the other.

Again, take a breath. Or don’t.

Two days later, they spent the night before the Inter semi-final in a trattoria in Milan. The same one Ángel insisted on visiting whenever they were in the city. Owl had his water. Ángel had something brown and burning. Inter fans jeered across the aisle. Ángel blew kisses. Owl asked for the bill.

“You should enjoy it more,” Ángel said, tearing a piece of bread in half and offering it across the table like communion.

“I enjoy the work,” Owl replied.

“And this is not work?”

“No. This is the moment before the work begins.”

They sat in silence for a while. Owl’s phone buzzed. Sens was showing growth, beginning to swagger in the U20s. His time in the big league was coming. Ángel checked the league table again, like it might have changed in the last ten minutes.

“You still thinking about the 433?” he asked.

“I’m always thinking about the 433,” Owl replied.

“You’re the only man I know who thinks in quadrants.”

Owl raised an eyebrow. 

“You’re still backing the 3-4-1-2?”“With that back line? With Wilfried flying and Serge Kingue raring to go and seemingly ready to learn fast? Absolutely. And if not, we open with the 4-4-2, shock them early, then slide into the groove.”

Owl nodded slowly. 

“Krzysztof and Gnonto up top. Kouamé just behind or out wide. Pedro creating and Pulgar dictating in the middle. Options. All good options.”

Ángel grinned.

“I told you. We’re cooking with fire.”

They toasted. To Florence, to bold ideas, to Vella and Sens both saying no to Milan and yes to La Viola.The window had been frantic. Real Madrid snatching Monchu. Juventus folding under pressure twice in a week. Now, the Serie A table tighter than Owl’s jaw at a press conference. Roma top, Viola second, Inter lurking with two games in hand. Milan and Juve still there, or thereabouts.

It was anyone’s title.

My fiancé—Tristan Blake—froze all my supplementary cards that very night.  
  
  
He ignored my pleas and threatened to deport me:  
  
  
""Just because grandfather arranged our engagement doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. What right do you have to offend the West family?""  
  
  
""That bracelet on Vera's wrist? It's from her deceased mother. Since you love overreacting to trivial matters, perhaps some time abroad will teach you some humility.""  
  
  
As the plane took off, I deleted all the photos of Tristan and me.  
  
  
Three years later, I sat in the North American Regional Director's office as my assistant handed me the visitor list.  
  
  
Tristan sat on the reception room sofa, his attitude still condescending:  
  
  
""Grandfather's health isn't great, and he's pressing again. Come back with me to get married.""  
  
  
""Vera's having some investment troubles lately. I need to be by her side. When talking to grandfather, you know what to say.""

Tristan seemed enraged by my attitude and grabbed my wrist forcefully.  
  
  
""What are you performing?""  
  
  
""Look at this face,"" he leaned in maliciously, ""three years have passed, and you even have wrinkles around your eyes.""  
  
  
He deliberately rubbed his thumb against the corner of my eye. ""You're lucky I'm still willing to marry you.""  
  
  
The conference room's glass wall reflected my image.  
  
  
Three years of grinding struggle had indeed left marks on my face.  
  
  
But what stung more was the contempt in Tristan's words.  
  
  
""I won't go back with you."" I turned my head and yanked my wrist free.  
  
  
Tristan suddenly smiled. ""Unwilling?""  
  
  
He pulled out his phone from his suit pocket and swiped the screen. ""Should I read some of the messages you sent over the past three years? 'Tristan, Canada is so cold.' 'Today I passed by that restaurant we used to go to.' 'How is grandfather's health?'...""  
  
  
With each sentence he read, my blood grew colder.  
  
  
""You... received them?"" My voice trembled.  
  
  
During those first months in Canada, I couldn't bear missing Tristan.  
  
  
I had tried to contact him many times.  
  
  
But he never replied.  
  
  
I thought... he had never received them.  
  
  
""Of course."" Tristan answered carelessly. ""Sometimes Vera and I look at them together. She always says your writing is quite good, very touching.""  
  
  
I felt dizzy, gripping the edge of the conference table to keep from falling.  
  
  
Vera—Tristan had forced me to Canada over one sentence from her, and they had actually... mocked my desperation together?  
  
  
""Get out."" I heard my hoarse voice.  
  
  
Tristan was stunned for a moment, then suddenly narrowed his eyes threateningly: ""Amara, you dare speak to me like this?""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""You struggled in Canada for three years and still haven't learned to bow your head?""  
  
  
""You think working as some low-level manager at a small company can free you from my control?""  
  
  
I tried to break free but was pressed against the glass wall by Tristan, his burning breath against my ear.  
  
  
""Tristan,"" I struggled to press the emergency button on the desk, ""do I need to call security?""  
  
  
Tristan's expression instantly darkened as he yanked my wrist.  
  
  
""Let go!"" I lifted my foot to kick his knee, but he dodged sideways.  
  
  
Tristan sneered and dragged me out by the wrist.  
  
  
""Tristan, you're crazy! Let me go!""  
  
  
I struggled desperately, but he ignored me, striding toward the elevator.  
  
  
The moment the elevator doors closed, I bit down hard on his shoulder.  
  
  
The taste of blood spread in my mouth. Tristan groaned but held me even tighter.  
  
  
""Amara, what the fuck?! Are you a dog?"" He shoved me into the car and slammed the door shut.  
  
  
I immediately tried the door handle, only to find it was locked.  
  
  
""Save your strength."" Tristan loosened his tie, his eyes dark. ""Either come back and marry me now, or I'll show you right now what it really means to be my wife.""  
  
  
I shivered all over, staring at him in disbelief: ""You're shameless!""  
  
  
Seeing I didn't dare move, Tristan released me with satisfaction and started the car.  
  
  
I curled up in the corner of the seat, clenching my fists.  
  
  
Before we left, I had made a gesture to my assistant hiding nearby.  
  
  
The Blake family empire might be vast, but it wasn't invincible.  
  
  
If my assistant was smart enough, she would know who to call.  
  
  
The scenery outside the window grew increasingly familiar.  
  
  
The Blake family butler warmly welcomed us: ""Tristan, Miss Amara! The Old Master will be so happy to know you're back!""  
  
  
When we pushed open the door, the old man was leaning against his headboard reading.  
  
  
Seeing me, his cloudy eyes instantly brightened.  
  
  
""Amara!"" He extended a trembling hand. ""Come here quickly.""  
  
  
My nose stung as I hurried over to grasp his hand.  
  
  
The broad palm from my memories was now withered and fragile, veins protruding.  
  
  
""Grandpa, how did you..."" My voice choked.  
  
  
He smiled and patted my hand.  
  
  
""It's nothing, just getting old. But you... it must have been hard abroad, wasn't it?""  
  
  
Tristan stood aside coldly, watching.  
  
  
""Amara,"" grandfather suddenly started coughing, ""I plan to leave this old house to you...""  
  
  
""I don't want it!"" I instinctively spoke up. ""Grandpa, I have my own career now. I'm doing well.""  
  
  
But his face suddenly turned pale, then he began coughing violently.  
  
  
He clutched his chest, struggling to breathe.  
  
  
""Grandpa!"" Panic surged through me as I frantically pressed the call button by his bed.  
  
  
Tristan roughly pushed me aside.  
  
  
""You did this on purpose, didn't you?""  
  
  
He glared at me with disgust. ""Stimulating grandfather the moment you return, so you can inherit everything, right?""  
  
  
I had no energy to argue, anxiously watching grandfather being resuscitated.  
  
  
Suddenly, Tristan whirled around, grabbed my throat, and pressed me against the wall.  
  
  
""This is all your fault! Who told you to upset grandfather!""  
  
  
I struggled to breathe, my vision blurring, but I still stubbornly glared at him.  
  
  
""Tristan!"" The butler rushed in and pulled him away. ""Your grandfather is what matters most right now!""  
  
  
Tristan released his grip, and I slid to the floor, coughing violently.  
  
  
He looked down at me, his gaze ice-cold: ""Go kneel and clean the living room. Don't get up without my permission.""  
  
  
I refused to leave but was dragged away by several servants.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
They locked me in the living room until deep into the night.  
  
  
I knelt on the floor scrubbing, my knees quickly going numb.  
  
  
The butler secretly came to tell me grandfather was unconscious, but Tristan discovered this and fired him on the spot.  
  
  
The next evening, the sound of high heels echoed in the hallway.  
  
  
Vera wore a new Chanel suit, the bracelet on her wrist looking familiar.  
  
  
""Tristan."" She intimately linked arms with him. ""I brought you chicken soup. You haven't eaten all day.""  
  
  
Seeing me, she dramatically covered her mouth: ""My God, Amara, what happened to you? You look haggard.""  
  
  
She leaned closer to observe me. ""Your eyes are swollen from crying. Trying to win sympathy?""  
  
  
I jerked my head up, darkness flashing before my eyes.  
  
  
Vera stepped back in fright, caught in Tristan's embrace.  
  
  
""She’s bad news."" She hid in Tristan's arms, her voice particularly clear. ""Killed her parents, cursed everyone she's touched. Now she's back and grandfather is sick again. The Blake family must have used up all their luck raising you.""  
  
  
Tristan's gaze turned ice-cold.  
  
  
He released Vera and grabbed my chin: ""Did you hear that? You owe the Blake family a debt you can never repay in this lifetime.""  
  
  
My vision began to blur.  
  
  
I hadn't eaten in two days, my throat dry and painful.  
  
  
But worse than the physical pain were their words.  
  
  
""Tristan, please, let me see grandpa.""  
  
  
Tristan paused, his voice low.  
  
  
""See grandfather?"" He sneered. ""Are you worthy?""  
  
  
After speaking, they looked at me with disdain and left.  
  
  
Soon, intimate sounds came from outside the door.  
  
  
Through the crack, I saw Vera pressed against Tristan, her fingers lazily drawing circles on his chest.  
  
  
""Tristan, our engagement party is tomorrow. Are you ready?""  
  
  
Engagement party?  
  
  
I forced myself to lift my head, meeting Tristan's gaze directed at me.  
  
  
He smiled mockingly, then leaned down to whisper something in Vera's ear that made her laugh.  
  
  
By the third morning, my consciousness began to scatter.  
  
  
The moment my body pitched forward, my forehead struck the coffee table hard, warm liquid flowing into my eyes.  
  
  
In my daze, I heard Tristan's hurried footsteps.  
  
  
He helped me up, his fingers trembling as they touched my wound.  
  
  
""Let... go.""  
  
  
I forcefully shook off his hand. Tristan's expression immediately darkened.  
  
  
He leaned down, grabbed my chin, and forced me to look at him.  
  
  
""Amara, no one in the Blake family considers you the heiress anymore.""  
  
  
Blood from my forehead slid past my eyes, turning my vision red.  
  
  
Tristan released his grip, and I fell heavily back to the floor.  
  
  
""From today on, you'll remain in the Blake family as a servant.""  
  
  
Tristan's voice was ice-cold.  
  
  
""This house will become your prison. You'll scrub every floor on your knees until you've repaid the disasters you've brought to this family.""  
  
  
I supported myself on the table and slowly stood up, the pain from my knees nothing compared to the anguish in my heart.  
  
  
""Tristan."" I wiped the blood from my eyes. ""I'm no longer the Amara who was under your control three years ago.""  
  
  
Tristan frowned, clearly not expecting me to resist.  
  
  
""I've been promoted to North American Regional Director of Hayes Corporation during my three years in Canada.""

1mkatab,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mkatab,Tips for bonding 2 fight-y males,"I’m currently an hour into a bonding session between the two males and the first 30 minutes were absolute chaos (I got bitten twice) but the last 30 minutes have been fine. I still would like some advice. Even though I’m probably being dramatic and they will be fine.

I bonded Coffee and Luna (both neutered, male and female) a year ago and it was so easy… Now I need to bond them with Pastel… 

Luna is fine. Definitely not the problem here. She even seems to like him. 

I haven’t done a bonding session with the 3 together. But the two males have been having a harder time.

We present the two demon children:

Coffee - 2 years old (neutered in August 2024). Bonded to Luna and my first ever rabbit (adopted in May 2024)

Pastel - 10 months old (neutered in June). I got him when he was 2 months. Since then (December 2024) Coffee and Luna are in a large play pen next to Pastel’s play pen (which is slightly smaller). 

All 3 have always seen each other through bars. Sometimes Pastel would peak his head through the bars and Coffee would get upset and fight. So sometimes we would stay 1-2 months with cardboard or towels separating them.

When I started the bonding they only had the bars separating them. But as soon as I did my first session between the boys they started fighting more through the bars so I put a towels covering them. The first session was last week/weekend I think? Something like that.

I’ve been doing 1 bonding session of 10 minutes almost everyday. And today tried to hit the 1 hour mark.

There have been some incidents where they seem to want to be together? Once I came in the room (where they are separated by play pens) and suddenly Coffee is inside of Pastel’s pen - both chilling, ignoring each other. Another time I was with Pastel on the bed with the play pen door unlocked and Coffee gets out, goes on the bed and just… stays there… no fights, just chilling.

But today was hard! I got bitten twice and the second time made a hell of a wound (a bit of bleeding I’m actually just dramatic). None of them are bleeding or are hurt because I’m always separating them. 

It was really frustrating but all of a sudden I look at the clock and it’s been 30 minutes with no fights. Right now they aren’t fighting but one in a while lunge at each other.

I’m doing it in a neutral space. I have treats and food that I scattered around so they’re busy. I’m probably just venting because I really want them to get along. I think I’m doing the correct process but my questions are:

How long should I do each bonding session? And how long does it normally take for them to be besties? Are there any other techniques? What can I add or improve on? Are they going to be fine?

1mkapxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mkapxm/the_last_voyage_of_the_alaskan_dawn/,The Last Voyage of the Alaskan Dawn,"Call me Ike, though that is not my real name. Honestly, with how the last seven weeks have been, I’m not sure if I could ever go back to my real name. The only thing I can say with total certainty is that I am the sole survivor of the Alaskan Dawn. How I found myself on that ship was born through dumb luck and bad decisions. Like a crook doing one last job.



I enlisted in the Marines two years out of high school once I discovered the college wasn’t for me. The late 2010s meant I was going to Afghanistan. It was supposed to be two years active duty and four years in the reserves. It was a good career to supplement me until something I actually wanted to do came around. That was until April 2019, not a full six months into my second year, and an IED went off near my Humvee. I was the gunner, and needless to say, my military career was cut drastically short.



I was thankful to have my limbs, but six inches of steel pierced my hip. Between that and the ravenous concussion, I was sent home early. To this day, I suffer from tinnitus. Took nearly four hours of surgery to remove the steel, but they couldn’t get it all. Some of it was too close to the femoral artery that removing it would probably kill me.



Upon returning home and getting disability, I felt useless. I started drinking heavily. It got to the point that two months before the anniversary of my ‘survival’, I was checked into rehab for alcohol abuse. With COVID, and my chances of getting a real job already low, I went back to the booze. When the world started back up, I was forced back into rehab. That seemed to stick, and I’ve been sober ever since.



So naturally, I replaced alcohol with gambling.



Vice 2 wasn’t as easily forgiven. No help from my parents, and I can’t blame them. When I was 22 and struggling, they wanted to nurse their baby boy. But at 27, they weren’t about the shill out thousands more to fix a different problem. Can’t say I blame them, I didn’t have a job, and all of my disability checks were hitting Fan Duel faster than any real bill I had.



It got to the point where I was banned from Foxwoods for not paying back my debt.



It took me realizing that I would be out of money the same week that my check came in, that maybe it was time to find a job. That was also a problem. Personality-wise, I didn’t want to hump a desk 9-5, but most other jobs required me to stand for hours at a time, which was terrible on my hip.



Next best chance, next to Indeed, was Craigslist. I ignored all the ones that were asking for hitman services; those were all police plants wanting to nab a spouse wanting to whack their significant other. There were a couple other security ads, and then I stumbled on this one.



Security needed for Boat Voyage. Ex-service members only. Pays cash. Seemed simple enough. The description was even more convincing. Easy money and a one-time gig. Pays handsomely. Looking for people willing to spend up to three weeks offshore. Once complete, you will be paid and communications will cease.



At this point, I saw no red flags.



Well, no red flags that turned me off. It was a mysterious person online, and for all I knew, I was signing up for gladiator fights on a cruise, but I had no money in either my checking or savings account, so I was beyond desperate. If for nothing else, I would feel like I was contributing.



I emailed an inquiry. Something simple: how much?



The reply was quick from a clear burner email address, a random assortment of letters and numbers: 2,000 per day. Food and other supplies will be provided. Any other questions?



I emailed back: what is the job?



The reply was quick and unnerving: I see you are from the New Haven, Connecticut region. I can meet you at the pizzeria on State Street, if you’re interested.



My heart sank at the knowledge of my address. I’m sure it was light work for a computer guy to trace an IP, but in no way did I feel any better. However, my math skills dulled my anxiety; 2k a day meant at most I was looking at 28k. A nice nest egg to be back on my feet. Maybe help me get a long-term job.



I simply replied I’m interested.



The pizzeria was crowded. I had two slices and a Coke; I focused on the parking lot. I wanted to see if I could spot the mystery man.



“That’s gonna get cold,” said the man who sat across from me. He had a narrow face. His glasses rested on the bridge of his nose. He wore a Yale street and jeans, looking almost too casual for this.



“How did-”



“C’mon, you’ve been watching the parking lot like a hawk. And you didn’t even touch your pizza,” said the man.



I shrugged and took a pizza. There was still some heat in there.



The man tapped his finger.



“Yeah?” I said with a mouth full of pizza.



“You emailed me, remember. Thought you wanted details.”



I swallowed and moved my plate aside. The man adjusted in his seat.



“My employer is looking for former servicemen; I can assume you are one.”



“Marines.”  



The man nodded. I felt him studying me like this interaction was a trial run. I leaned back and relaxed my shoulders.



“Good. The job is simple. There is a charter based out of California, it leaves in two days. Flight and the two-day stay at a hotel will be covered. Firearms will be provided for you.”



“Firearms, huh?”



“You don’t think we were selecting veterans for modeling, did you?”



I smirked.



“Is this offensive or defensive?”



“You and the others will be doing basic security. Just need to be careful of the cargo.”



“What are we moving?”



“Nothing of your concern. In fact, that’s the perfect segue into the three main rules.”



I took a sip of my Coke.



“Let’s hear them.”



“One, no names. Pick a call sign before you fly out. Two, no questions. If my employer or any of his delegates tells you to do something, you jump to it. And the final one is the difficult one.”



I waved him on; the pizza was calling my name.



“Should the ship sink or in any way fall into peril, you will not issue any form of SOS or Mayday.”



And there it was. The catch. No rescue. Success or death. Not quite the best option. But 28k was a lot of money for someone with none.



“Okay, I’m in.”



The man shook his head.



“Your driver’s license, please.”



“Excuse me?”



“C’mon, the no names is for you guys. I need it to verify if you fit our criteria.”



“Can you do that in two days?”



“It won’t take us two hours.” The man winked.



I scoffed. I took out my wallet, removed the license, and slid it across the table. The man looked and took a picture of it with his phone. He handed it back.



“Good to meet you. You’ll hear back soon.”



And I did. I went home, opened my laptop, and started to pace. After all, I had no money for rent, food, anything. If I got the job, I could negotiate with my landlord. Keep my head afloat until I got something more consistent. Three emails hit in rapid succession. The first was from a clear burner email.



Four words: You’re in. Pack light.



The second was my bank: $1,000 was deposited into my checking account.



The final was from Expedia: my flight to Santa Barbara and Marriott stay were booked and paid for.



For the first time in a while, I felt good.



It lasted until I got into the car at SBA. The flight was fine, barring some turbulence, but the car ride was unsettling. I was picked up by two big guys in suits; the bulges in their jackets were from shoulder holsters. They wore scarves to cover their faces. The worst part was that they were overly professional, opening the door, taking my bag.



While my scary valet pulled away, I watched the city move out the window. When I checked in, I was given a bag, said to have been left for me. When I opened it, there was a Visa gift card and a note.



This will cover your food until you board.



I spent the first day mostly in bed. I ordered a pizza around eight just to have something. California pizza sucked, but I wanted something cheap that delivered. Payment went through fine. I grabbed a soda from the vending machine and enjoyed some YouTube while I ate cardboard pizza with flat Sprite.



The next morning, I got the complimentary breakfast. As I looked for a seat, I was waved over. The guy was medium high but built. He was tan and had a surfer dude haircut.



“Thanks,” I said.



“You here for the mystery gig?” he said.



“What makes you say that?”



The guy laughed. He smacked the table, nearly spilling his tea.



“C’mon, you got bags under your arms, built strong, and you flew in on the same flight I did.”



“I didn’t see you,” I said.



“I was incognito,” he lifted his hands and enacted faux dodges.



“Charger,” he said, extending his hand. I forgot about the nicknames. So I panicked.



“Ike.”



Charger nodded and went back to breakfast. As we ate, we discussed, vaguely, about ourselves. Charger was a SoCal native; he was a Marine Scout Sniper for a few years and found the lack of work that matched that excitement. He took this job because it seemed fun. Can’t say I didn’t agree.



The only negative to Charger was his nickname; he chose it because of his favorite football team. As a Chiefs fan, it was hard for me to associate with a fan of a division rival, but hey, at least he wasn’t a Raiders fan.



“So did you hear any of the rumors?” asked Charger.



“Uh, no, I haven’t spoken to any about this aside from you and the guy who hired me.”



Charger downed his tea; his gulps rang out like church bells.



“From what I heard, this guy is some big shot in the pharmaceutical world, got caught up in some experimental shit.”



“Or maybe we’re protecting some rare earth metal being shipped overseas.”



Charger shrugged. I sipped my coffee. There was a nagging voice in my head telling me to finish breakfast, get an Uber, and promptly fuck off. I had that grand from glasses man, I could swing it. Fly back to New England and maybe try a desk job.



But my curiosity and determination outweighed any fear.



After breakfast, I went to my room and found another envelope. It had my name and full address on it. I opened it, and it was a contract. It was an NDA and the three rules on listed, each requiring an initial.



I will under no circumstances radio a Mayday or an SOS was seared into my mind.



I signed it. Selling your soul was easier than one might think. On the back of the envelope, I was told to put the contract inside and hand it to my driver.



At 2:30, we were checked out. The car took Charger and me from the hotel to the Port of Hueneme. The ride was quick; there wasn’t enough time to think or second-guess ourselves. When I stepped out of the car, my eyes were drawn to the USS Alaskan Dawn. It was a tanker ship, about 600 feet long. What caught my eye was a huge metal structure, about 50 feet tall and wide. I chalked it up to specialty cargo, but it was strange. Most cargo ships utilized the hull space; this seemed to be for a different purpose.



“Three-week sausage party, hope someone brought Vaseline,” whispered Charger to me. I smirked, but I doubted anyone wanted action on the seven seas.  His joke snapped me out of my questions. I reminded myself about the 28k.



And how I wasn’t supposed to ask questions.



There were about 12 of us. We checked in with our callsign and boarded.



On deck, there was a group of men in polos and trousers. Most of us were in khaki shorts, graphic tees, and the occasional ball cap. One guy was wearing a Pink Floyd shirt, which I appreciated. Another was wearing a shirt with Dante from Clerks saying, “I’m not even supposed to be here today.” I couldn’t talk shit, I was wearing an old Alex Smith jersey and camo shorts.



A tall man with thin grey hair walked passed the better-dressed men and turned to face. He was slightly underweight, and his skin wrinkled. He stood hunched. He cleared his throat.



“Greetings, gentlemen, for the sake of personal anonymity, call me Dr. Purple. This is my charter. My vessel. Now, we have received your signatures and NDAs. Henceforth, nothing on this ship happened. Your duties here are to ensure the safety of myself and my team over the next three weeks or so. As discussed before, each day will ensure you a lump sum. If any issues arise, my number 2, Mr. Nantucket, will see to your needs.”



He stepped aside, and Mr. Nantucket, a built man with bright red hair, stood forward.



“I’ll show you around.”



We followed him inside. He showed us the stairs to the bridge. In terms of active patrol, we were expected to rotate in 12-hour shifts. When not on, we could use the recreational room. There was a foosball table, a dartboard, and various board games next to the barracks.  Near the barracks and the hull were weapons cases. Rifles and ammo were stashed there. Food was at 8AM, 2PM, and 8PM with a few vending machines around. All seemed fine.



Along with Charger, I made friends with the two others we bunked with, Jules, a young Black man from Jersey City, and Poacher, a Hispanic guy from Chicago. Jules was in the National Guard, but this was a chance for extra money. Poacher was ex-Special Forces; he didn’t elaborate on which unit he was in. No one asked.



The first couple of days were simple. Jules and Poacher took the mornings. Charger and I took the nights. We usually stood topside and watched the water. By the end of the first night, we were miles from shore.



There was no one left to save us.



Night on the Alaskan Dawn was peacefully terrifying. There was no light on the water once the clouds were down. Aside from the overhead lights, there was nothing to be seen.



Charger and I were on deck patrol one night. There was always a moment, mid-patrol, where we stopped and just looked into the void, between a black sky and a dark sea. Usually, this was when Charger would strike up a cigarette.



“Who do you favor this season?” he asked.



“The Chiefs, duh.”



“I mean, yeah, but after that Super Bowl-”



“Don’t fucking go there, bolt boy.”



We took a beat to laugh, but in that silence, we realized something.



The engines were cut.



We stood and listened. There was no commotion. We willingly stopped. It was three days of travel, and now, we were at a standstill. From this height, we could still hear the waves splashing against the side of the ship.



“I don’t like this,” I said.



“Yeah.”



The rest of that night was uneventful. As was the night after that.



I don’t remember what day it was when Jules woke me up at around 11.



“What?” I snapped.



“Sorry, Ike, we need you and Charger on deck. Two of our morning crew are sick.”



I rolled out of bed and didn’t bother to fix my hair. I smacked Charger’s arm, which dangled over my bunk.



Thankfully, lunch was in an hour, so I could grab some grub before pulling a double shift.



“Make sure those assholes know they owe us one,” I said. Jules waved me off as he went topside.



I headed to the bridge to check the cameras. While it was part of my job, I never got to see the hull during the day. Especially what was going on in the big box.



The main camera guy was Bobcat; he was a good ole' boy from Arkansas. Spoke with the twang to boot.



“Mornin’, Ike, takin’ over for the two sickos?” said Bobcat.



“Yeah, coffee up here any good?”



“You know we ain’t supposed to ask no questions.”



“I thought that only applied to Dr. Purple’s people eaters.”



He chortled at that.



“I know, I know, I’m fuckin’ with you, Ike.”



I poured myself a coffee and drank it black. I peered over the camera and saw a glass box. Dr. Purple and two assistants were in the box. They were doing electrical work or something. All I saw were sparks. The camera wasn’t great.



“They synthesizing somethin’,” Bobcat said. He leaned back in his chair, allowing me a better view. Eventually, the white fuzzy silhouettes of Purple and Co. moved, and there lay a thin body. The thing was still. I couldn’t see any discernible features. I’d have written the thing off if I couldn’t see it breathing.



“Holy shit, Bob, you seeing this?” I asked.



“Seeing what?”



I watched as I saw little nubs start to sprout. I couldn’t hear a thing, but it was clear that it was struggling. The top of the thing began to pop and grow. The ‘head’ extended into becoming a lizard-like skull structure. Flesh ripped away as it went from blank to developed. A long tongue slid out and circled the air. My heart raced.



Pharmaceutical my ass, this was some John Hammond experimentation.



No laws on genetic testing in international waters.



We weren’t protection, we were containment.



The animal grew legs quick, they were thick. The arms were still small, like what a T-Rex’s arms would look like. The head smashed into the glass. Then again. And again. I couldn’t see it, but the thing cracked the glass.



The fourth smash caused the glass to shatter and collapse. My heart raced as that thing stepped out of the container. It beat so hard I could feel it in my ears.



An alarm blared. Lights flashed in the hull. CONTAINMENT BREACH! CONTAINMENT BREACH!



The scream carried across the ship. Bobcat and I stared in disbelief.



“Help me find the door seals,” he said.



We frantically searched the control panel. As we looked, the cameras picked up on the thing moving down a corridor. We heard the gunshots.



And the screams.



I finally found it and turned the key. The echo of doors closing in the hull rung out. I fell to the ground to catch my breath.



“What the fuck was that!” yelled Bobcat.



“I don’t know.”



We made our way down. Dr. Purple was MIA, Nantucket was around the survivors. Three of our security guys were gone. Poacher clutched his arm. I didn’t have to get a close look to see that it was gone below the bicep.



“I need everyone to calm down,” said Nantucket, his New England accent bleeding through.



“Fuck that! What is that?” yelled Poacher. He winced.



“That thing was simply procedural; you have nothing to worry about.”



“Bullshit.” Someone yelled.



“Fuck that.” Yelled another. Nantucket was sweating. He probably didn’t know what he had gotten himself into.



“We, uh, we locked the doors,” said Bobcat.



“The hull seals?” asked Nantucket. He nodded. I stood behind and watched. Nantucket rubbed his stubble. He took a deep breath.



“Okay, I’m not sure how this is going to work, but we need to isolate the thing and make sure it’s dead.”



“It’s sealed off, ain’t that enough?” chimed in Jules.



“No, I, I don’t know.” He walked over to the railing and hurled. He sighed and came back.



“Right now, Dr. Purple is the only one MIA. If you want to go back for the bodies of the dead, I won’t stop you. The hull is sealed off, but I don’t know if that will hold.”



Commotion and debate arose among the survivors.



“Do we have walkies?” I finally said.



Nantucket and the others looked at me.



“A few, mainly for the scientists, but what’s up?” he asked.



“Give me one. We’ll take a few guys in and see what we can do about this thing. Bobcat will take one and be our eyes in the hull.”



“Okay,” said Nantucket.



“I’ll take one too,” said Charger. He stood up.



“Let’s get you boys armed,” said Nantucket. I took the lead, along with me were Charger, Jules, and two other grunts I knew, Frazier and Dante, who still wore his Clerks shirt. It would be enough of a ragtag group to hopefully stop the madness.



Nantucket opened the locker. There were three radios. I took one, so did Charger. We each took a Daniel Defense AR with a 10-round magazine.



Fucking California Compliance.



Illegal experiments at sea were fine, but god-forbid we piss off the ATF.



We each took four mags each. At least carrying 10 rounds was easier than carrying four 30-round mags. I took a Sig Sauer as a sidearm. If I were getting mauled, I was going down swinging. Nantucket passed out flashlights.



“Good luck,” he said.



“Whoever bags it gets a bonus, right?”



“Ask me, you get bonuses for going down there,” said Nantucket. He turned and walked up the stairs. I held the rifle close and waited for Bobcat to chime in.



With a static and crack, I heard him.



“Alright, I’m in.”



I raised my thumb up to a camera.



“Can you see me?”



“Aye, aye, Ike.”



I took a deep breath. This was just another patrol. That’s all.



I spun open the door, and we started walking through. We turned the flashlights on and started our way down the hall.



“IKE, GUYS, BEHIND YOU!”



I turned around. Crawling from the roof and wrapping around the door was the thing. In 20 minutes, it had grown from about 2 feet long to 5 feet tall. It had full arms and could climb. Its pale skin was now steel grey.



It could camouflage.



We raised our rifles and fired. It was deafening. The beast slid down and Frazier by his ankle. He yanked him down with such force that his leg popped clean off. He screamed. It was more deafening than the rifle shots.



The thing lifted its head and burrowed its big jaws into the man’s chest.



Charger fired at the thing’s skull. It only stopped when a round struck it in the eye. It bled from where its eyes used to be. It didn’t roar or react; instead, it grabbed the carcass with its free hand and scurried into the darkness.  



“Anyone else hurt?” asked Charger. I dropped my magazine and reloaded.



“I’m good,” said Jules.



“Me, me too,” said the other. 



I took a deep breath.



We turned on our flashlights and held them close. The only way to the beast was to keep going.



As we reached the end of the hall, the fluorescent lights nearly blinded us when we got in. This was the big box. The sides were reinforced with titanium. The glass cage was shattered. Blood streaked across the floor. One of the scientists lay decapitated, his head nastily bitten off. The whole area reeked of rotting flesh. We searched high and low. Glass shattered under our boots.



“Holy shit!” yelled Jules. We rushed his position. He found a biohazard bin. Inside were easily a dozen, probably more, of the ‘base’. The white thin object was meant to become the specimen. At the top were the ones that got closest. Some had half-formed faces, others limbs. One had half a leg. They all stunk of decay.



“I’m gonna be sick,” said Charger. He found an empty bin and hurled.



The sound of metal crunching came from one of the side halls.



“Jules, with me, you two, stay and see if anyone else here survived.”



I took the lead. Jules was close behind.



“I shoulda never taken this job,” he said. His hands were shaking.



“Neither should I,” I said with a smile. It was fake. My nerves were fried, and my hip was hurting. I had to fight through. Can’t take charge and crap out.



I stopped in front of what seemed like the tail. That thing grew quick. It wasn’t even an hour, and it had an additional limb. I looked up to trace the beast, see if I could see underneath it. That’s when it shook and pulled up.



That wasn’t a tail.



That was its arm.



The top floor of the deck was collapsing.



“Go, go, go, go, go!” I yelled. Jules didn’t take much convincing. We turned around as the deck above us came tumbling down. The door felt like miles away. I dove, losing my rifle, but I landed.



I turned, expecting Jules right behind me.



But he wasn’t.



“Ike, I’m almost there!” I watched him jump forward. I reached out to grab him. Our arms locked fast and firm. That’s when four long grey claws came from the darkness and snatched his torso.



He screamed, and blood squirted from his mouth. With a crunch, we all knew his ribs were broken.



I dropped to the ground with his arms in mine. Charger grabbed his arms, and Dante fired into the darkness.



“Please, don’t let me die like that,” Jules groaned.



“I won’t kid, hang on,” I said.



A single gunshot rang out, causing Charger and me to drop him. In that split second, we only saw where the bullet went into Jules’ head.



The beast roared and dragged Jules into the depths of the boat.



Behind us was Dr. Purple with my Sig Sauer in his hand.  



“You piece of shit!” I yelled. Charger didn’t hesitate; he shot the doctor in the stomach. The doctor fell to the ground. I grabbed the handgun off the floor and tucked it into my waistband.



“Do you know what you’ve done?” choked the doctor.



“I don’t give a fuck,” said Charger. He walked away.



“What is that thing?” I asked. The doctor shook his head.



“You killed me. That means no payment for any of you. That man was a goner; once he was in the claws, he was dead.”              



“Man? He was 19!”



The doctor said nothing. I dropped my boot onto his knee. He recoiled in pain. I got in close.



“What is that thing?”



“It’s a success, that’s what it is.”



I pressed down hard.



“No games, what the fuck is that!?”



“It’s an amalgamation. I wanted to see how certain DNAs interacted and what they formed. This one seemed to be the most compatible.”



“What DNA!”



“Doesn’t matter. I’m dead anyway.”



I punched the wound. He jolted and spat blood.



“Takes a long time to bleed out from a gut shot, Doc.”



He shook his head. His lips were already drying out.



“The base is Monitor lizard, then we started adding. Various species of venomous fish, like the Cuttlefish, squid, we even tried whale.”



“What the fuck is in that one?” I asked less curious and more panicked.



“Monitor, Humboldt Squid, Cuttlefish, Rhinoceros, Sperm Whale, and Human.”



“You put human DNA in there!”



“Had plenty of it,” he said with a sickening grin.



Then I realized something, part whale, it could hear us.



With a loud bang, the ship shook. The thing was still growing. It was still trying to kill everything onboard.  



“Let’s move,” I said.



“What about him?” asked Dante. I watched as the creature’s back broke through the floor. It’s ugly, regrown eye, which was still covered by a thin layer of skin, peered from the crack.



“Leave him.” No one argued as we turned around and left the lab.



Dr. Purple’s screams followed us until a loud squelch silenced them. 



I radioed Bobcat down. When we got topside, the few survivors stood in a semi-circle. Poacher died; white foam poured from his agape mouth. The toxins from the beast infected the wound and killed him quickly.



There weren’t many of us left. Killing this thing was the only option.



Charger explained the situation as best he could. Once he was done, Nantucket pulled me aside.



“If everything you said is true, sinking the ship might be our best bet.”



“Are you fucking crazy? Sink the ship.”



“We have lifeboats. We can escape. Get far enough away and send out the SOS.”



“So much for the no SOS clause.”



“Lennard, Purple is dead; there is no sense in preserving this.”



The slip was fatal. Lennard had to be Doctor Curtis Lennard from Johns Hopkins. I didn’t read much science stuff, but he made a big name for himself during the pandemic. Mainly for his work on rDNA vaccines. He understood the science well. Of course, three years after the pandemic and dozens of conspiracy theories later, he was kicked out of Hopkins and practically blacklisted for ejecting cancer patients with lobster DNA to see how it would help treatment.



Spoiler alert: it made them sick.



Medical genius or mad scientist didn’t seem that far apart.



“How did you end up here, working for him?” I asked.



Nantucket smirked.



“Opioid addiction makes you do crazy things. I needed money for pills or rehab, whichever seems right after this.”



“Makes you feel any better, I took it to fix my gambling debts.”



“Well, I hope we make it to enjoy healthier lifestyles.”



I nodded. Nantucket took a deep breath and walked in front of the survivors.



“Okay, here’s the plan. Ike, Charger, and I will go to the engine room; we’ll overcharge the engine and detonate the ship. That will cause the ship to sink fast and cause a vortex. That thing will likely be unable to escape the ship when that happens. Doctor Anastasia will lead the rest of you to the lifeboats. Each of you take a walkie so we can communicate. From there, we’ll deploy the SOS.”



Everyone nodded.



Everyone understood.



The three was us went down into the catacombs of the Alaskan Dawn.



We kept the flashlights on; there were no lights down there. The hallways felt tight. The foul stench of abomination whiffed through the halls. It got to the point where Nantucket covered his mouth with a cloth. The metal creaked.



Then snapped.



A large column slammed around them. It was the thing's leg. I looked up the hole and saw the torso. The tail went down and entire hallway.



“Run,” I said.  



Our steps began to echo, and that’s when the beast turned around above us. The metal churned as it lifted its leg and maneuvered its way behind us. As we sprinted, it gained on us. The rot from its breath stained the back of our shirts. Its jaws snapped at them. Stopping to shoot wasn’t an option.



“We’re almost there!” yelled Nantucket.



I thought we were far enough from the snapping jaws.



Eventually, it got one of us.



Charger.



His death was quick, one snap, and he was folded in half. It was down the beast’s throat before I could react.



Nantucket held the door so I could get in and then slammed it. The beast rammed into the door, but it could not break it down. As I gasped for air, I heard it retreat. Nantucket had the plan; he started opening up valves and letting gas out.



“Ike, you should go,” he said, flatly.



“What, why?” I asked.



“Only one of us needs to be here for this to go off, and” his voice trailed off. He took a deep breath.



“Before I took this job, I was in jail. Held because I accidentally ran my son over while I was high. He’ll never walk again because of my actions. I don’t deserve a second chance. If you get out, you deserve one. Good luck.”



I said nothing in the argument. I patted him on the back and walked out. I heard the door slam behind me, and I started to ascend from the depths.



I found a lifeboat and boarded it solo. The others already were in the water, floating nearby. I managed to start the boat up and head out.



“Ike, Ike, you okay?” asked Bobcat.



“Copy Bobcat.”



From our lifeboats, we saw the top of the Alaskan Dawn peel back. The beast burst out of the top of the ship. Its upper body was huge. The thickness of his body showed, and its skin was a light bluish grey color. One eye was black and the other, the one Charger shot out, was yellow. One arm snuck out of the hull and snaked like a tentacle.



It grabbed the other lifeboat and squeezed tight. The windows blew out. I heard gunfire come from the boat as it was lifted.



Then the explosion erupted. Fire came out of the rear of the ship. I ducked as shrapnel ripped across the ocean. Metal ripped through the top of my lifeboat.



The Alaskan Dawn started to capsize. Within minutes, the ship, the beast, and the survivors were underwater.



Nantucket was right; the vortex almost instantly and pulled everything under water.



When the ocean was still, I started attempting an SOS.



I was out on the ocean for at least a week. It took a Japanese fishing ship to find me. They brought me back to the country. It took me about two months to recover, and thank god for the Japanese healthcare system being free. My doctor, Tsuneo Miyamoto, told me that if I had been out there for another day, I likely wouldn’t have been able to be saved.



While I recovered, a Navy Master-at-Arms came to my room and gave me a light interrogation as to what the hell I was doing on a lifeboat, alone, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I lied, I don’t even remember if my lie was convincing. Truth is, I don’t know what Lennard’s plan was; for all I know, it could’ve been a government contract. All I knew was that whatever that science was, it was best left at the bottom of the ocean.



I used my down time at the hospital to look for jobs in Japan. English teaching jobs were the only thing I was good enough for. Thankfully the USD could be stretched further in the Japan than my home country.



I hope to start a new life here.



But I am haunted by one thing in the back of my mind.



The beast, that thing, had whale DNA in it.
