1h87ns2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1h87ns2/i_dont_want_to_parent_with_my_partner_anymore/,I don’t want to parent with my partner anymore. Hating my living situation. ,"I feel as though my partner is extremely neurotic. He is very fearful of toxins in every aspect of life. This has led to severely restricting our diets, products in our home environment, places we’re allowed to go to. Everything is seen as extremely dangerous to our health. Sure, many things might be but at the end of the day what can we do? It’s just the state of our current world. 

Some examples of what’s he afraid of:

-Food that isn’t organic, comes in plastic, has animal products, made with/cooked in water that isn’t distilled water.. essentially we’re left with homemade food and homemade snacks. No fast food; no packaged food; no coffee from coffee shops; no packaged snacks like fruit snacks, string cheese, chips, granola bars. Sure we can hand-make it, but with a toddler I am way too tired with already making the regular meals and doing all the chores and laundry. 
-Body products unless they’re made from fruits and vegetables (yes there actually are a couple brands that have this thankfully). So no drugstore deodorant, shampoos, soap, cologne. He doesn’t even want us to use sunscreen bc it’s made from toxins and wants us to make it using Carrotseed oil + jojoba (carrier) oil. (This rule I absolutely override.)
-Water that isn’t distilled water. Can only cook with distilled water. Can only drink distilled water. No outside prepared food bc of the type of water they may have used. Also afraid of the shower water and outside hose water. All summer our toddler could only play with distilled water and was not allowed to play with the hose water outside. This also means no swimming pools or water parks bc the water is chlorinated which is toxic to the gut microbiome. So this means no swimming lessons for our toddler which is a huge problem bc I want him to learn to swim for safety. 
-No cleaning products. Can only use baking soda and vinegar. Finally able to use a laundry detergent which is Molly’s suds. It also took a long time to be allowed to use the dishwasher bc soap disrupts the gut microbiome. (Using mollys suds dishwasher pods for this.) Only the dishes that I personally use can go in the dishwasher and all of the other household members dishes have to be washed by hand. I already have to use my own separate dishes bc I eat animal products and the other household ppl are vegan and are terrified of cross contamination. (However I am finally allowed to feed our son eggs from the farmers market.) I’m also not allowed to use dish soap on the hand washed dishes bc of the gut microbiome fear (this rule is stupid and I use Dr Bronners Castile soap and have to literally hide using the soap while washing.)
-Partner’s brother has lived with us for 4 years and he has been unemployed the entire duration. He is fully mentally and physically abled. 
Partner works from home. (We’re all late 30s/early 40s.) So they’re here all day while I’m a SAHM to our toddler. I’m hovered over and criticized. We hide out half of the day in baby’s (huge) room and after lunch leave for 4 to 6 hours a day to get some space. 
-Partner is afraid of toxins in every environment. We live in a location that already has snow and has been 20 degrees F since early November. Until April, this mostly limits us to indoor spaces. He’s afraid of the fragrances that you can smell at the mall so we can only go into the bookstore or to the library. We’re not allowed to play at the indoor playground facility in town bc the equipment is made of soft material that is made from toxins. (Also not allowed to go to parks that have the soft rubber floor at the playground or the tire shreds bc they’re made of toxins.) 
-He’s afraid of our baby playing with toys made of plastic. We just got a bunch a toddler-age games for Thanksmas and partner, who was hovering yesterday during his work hours, asked why toddler has so many toys now made of plastic and that the BPA and phalates could make (boy) toddler feminine and have cancer. 
-He’s very fearful of the EMFs from technology and my phone has to be on airplane mode with cell data off, Bluetooth off, Wi-Fi off, bc it’s toxic to the toddler. As a side note, my family lives a 27 hour drive away across the country, my only way of being able to keep in touch with them is through my phone. Plus partner is home 24/7 so I’m only able to really text them late at night and is too late in the day for a call. My phone plan is also only $6 a month  so I do not have data or minutes to be able to call or FaceTime them when I’m out of the house. Sometimes it feels like I’m being isolated. 

I am trying to not lose my mind being around him hearing his fears constantly. Every couple weeks there is a new fear that is added to the list that he becomes extremely stressed about. I used to try to reason with him but there is no room for discussion bc he quickly reaches irritability when I try to say that it’ will be ok (and that there’s too many rules). He also tries to rationalize every single fear that it’s about our son’s health and safety. 

I feel like since having our child this toxin stuff completely makes up his personality at this point and I do not like it. Also our income is below the poverty line, and I have no way of financially making it on my own. I have no car. No money (we’re not married and I only have access to two credit cards, no accounts). I’m on Medicaid while they’re on his work insurance. The job I left makes $41,000 a year so below the poverty line and the cheapest studio apartment here is $1200 which hasn’t had availability so the next cheapest studio is $1400. And then I’d have daycare costs to pay on top of that. And would need to save up for a cheap car. Plus be able to buy food. (Housing for single parents who need out of their situation here have a waitlist. And leaving the state to be with my family is against the custody laws.) 

I just don’t know what to do or how to handle my partner’s strictness. I want him to change or maybe I want out. ",2,1733508543.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False

I just ended an 8 year relationship 2 months ago. I'm going to admit and say I wasnt a good boyfriend. During the relationship, we were on and off. I know she loves me. I love her as well. I just don't have what it takes in me to meet the request and expectations she has for me. She's the type of girl that shuts her brain off and let the guy do everything. She never fails to bring up that growing up, since shes the older sister, and the older sibling always do everything in the family, she expects that during the relationship she should be the one getting taken care of. I never had an issue with that. I only have an issue when it compromises my needs and wants.

For example, she likes to eat prawns but doesn't twant to dirty her fingers so she wants me to peel it for her or how I feel guilty when I want to hang out with my friends after work. For hanging out with friends, I understand, she does not have many friends if not only just a handful but not close enough to hang out hence I'm the only person she hangs out with other than her family. Another thing Is that the dates get expensive and she wants random gifts or flowers. I tried to communicate, saying how I don't have that much of an income and savings. I told her I have to contribute to my uni fees and I'm saving up for our overseas trip. Also, I can't always be paying for dates. And the fact that she knows my background and she comes from a similar background, I don't understand why she can say things like ""if you wanted to you would"" or ""I'm not asking for expensive flowers or gifts, it's just the thought"". It's just so unrealistic and impractical in the long run.

Another example, we were having supper at a coffee shop. However there weren't any drink stalls open at that timing as it was late and she wanted drinks. I walked ard the coffee shop. I told her there aren't any drinks stalls open and she got pissed and left. 30mins later she came back and said she came from the ntuc with a bottled drink. Was I suppose to do that?

I don't think I have ever asked for anything in the relationship. All I want is just her support and assurance because while being together, lots of guys hit her up. Yes she doesn't entertain them, but she doesn't fail to bring up that other guys put in the effort you can't.

And breaking up after 8 years she found another guy in a month and he's basically everything she wanted. And honestly, I'm just so lost. I know I said what I said in this post, but we did have something special. I can't believe I was that easily replaced. We had a talk after and she said we just think too differently. 

Now after reading this, I have a few questions. I'm sorry it's quite lengthy and wordy but I just needed a place to vent and I hope this place is the place.

1)How much are you willing to change for a person? If you want something from your partner, but they can't give you what you want, what would you do? I know there are levels and it depends on how much it matters to you

2) As a guy, is it normal to always be the one giving? Is it normal for us always having to be the one to provide? Am I just lazy? She always brings up being the older sister and being in a relationship is her being able to be babied/taken care of. Do I just not have what it takes? Is it bad for me that I may want that kind of treatment as well? I too want to unwind and relax. She's my comfort, she my safe space.

3)what should I do now? I still want her back. She's my best friend. I feel I could have done what she asks but I just want her to understand my pov. I feel it's so fking wasted. We practically are family already. We've done everything together. She said she doesn't know where her current relationship is going as she's just giving the guy a chance. Am I just delusional?

We know each other from the school choir and ballroom dancing classes. We don’t know each other that well, but he’s been on my mind and we occasionally talk once in a while. 

There’s a small dance night tomorrow, that the ballroom dance studio we go to hosts every weekend, and I’m thinking about asking him out to get a coffee or something, but even though I’m feeling really confident right now, I know I will be too scared and chicken out. 

I’m trying to handle this as maturely as possible, but I’m still scared and I don’t really know what to do. We sometimes chat a bit about Broadway and Queen during those dance nights and I want to just somehow pull a ‘do you want to get a coffee with me sometime?’ Out of my mouth, but it’s so hard. 
It’s not even that I’m scared of rejection. I’m scared that I’ll be judged. Judged for asking out someone who’s two grades above me, judged for thinking he might have been interested in me, and I just get tongue tied.

I feel like he did it on purpose. Do we break up? ,"I had an interview and I asked him if he could drop me off that day and he said he would. I don’t know how to drive and I don’t have a car, he does and he drives me anywhere I have to go. I have anxiety about driving. He never had an issue about driving me before. 

In the morning, he was taking a long time to get up and I kept asking him if he could drive me now and he got annoyed and said he will. He said he had to shower first and I told him I just needed him to drive me and he could come back home and shower after. But he said he had to shower and had to wait. It started to get late so I asked him to please hurry up and he was taking forever and started shaving his beard. It was really important for me and I had to be there on time so I guess I was being annoying and kept asking him to please hurry. He got annoyed and started yelling at me, he said he has to drive me everywhere and I have to learn how to drive because I’m a burden and annoying. I told him to just drive me this last time and then I’ll learn how to drive. He said he changed his mind and he’s not taking me. I was freaking out and asked him what I’m supposed to do and he said to figure it out. I was already running late for my interview and I just downloaded the Lyft app and got one but it said the driver was 20 mins away. I was so upset and asked him to please just drive me and he said he doesn’t want to. When my driver came and I was going to leave, he said good luck and I was so upset I told him to f himself. I ended up hitting traffic and I was incredibly late to my interview. I didn’t even go in because it was embarrassing. I tried emailing them and asking for a second chance but I probably won’t get it. They haven’t replied yet. I just came to a coffee shop and have been sitting here feeling so depressed.

1h87jqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h87jqu/my_28m_wife_27f_cheated_on_me/,My (28M) wife (27F) cheated on me.,"This one is a little bit long, sorry in advance. I just needed someone to talk to about and get advice of how to move forward.

Call me shocked, but it happened. The woman I married cheated on me, again. I can't say I'm surprised because she has wondering eyes and has done it before, but I forgave her. We have talked about this multiple time before, with her admitting her mistake and asking for forgiveness.

I just thought we had a good relationship and communication style and talked about everything. Sure we have fought just like every other couple, but i didnt think it would drive her to do this behind my back, you know? We wouldn't hide anything from each other and always told each other everything, but it does not seem like this was the case.

I found the evidence when I was cleaning out her car today. She had taken our daughter off to preschool with our newborn. I work from home, so I just thought it was like every other day, but I noticed that she came home a little bit later than normal, but I brushed it off as her going to get coffee as she sometimes does. I was wrong and I wished that she had just thrown away the evidence.

What makes me angry is that she did the deed while our newborn was in the car with her. How disgusting is that? I know he won't remember it, but why make him watch? I hope he was asleep at least.

I decided to confront her with the evidence and she broke down and said ""I'm so sorry, please forgive me! I couldn't help myself. It was just too good to pass on."" Like am I to believe that? I had to walk away before getting too upset and starting screaming at her in front of our kids. 

She apologized and said ""I'm so sorry for getting Taco bell without calling to see if you wanted anything!""

I haven't talked to her since, what should I do?

(Plus new donor bonus money) Using the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

I wanted a way to calculate the equivalent dial setting on my Ode Gen 2 when a roaster gives a micron grind size recommendation. Onyx has a (beta) calculator on their website, but it only offers whole numbers, skipping the three steps between. I saw that user /u/IronCobalt42 made a shortcut that took the math that Onyx figured out and allowed fractional (thirds) settings. However, I didn't particularly like that it required you to open a Safari webpage and access the shortcut via the share menu, and then Siri would speak the result to you.

I made a new shortcut that lets you run it like a regular shortcut and outputs the text as text on the screen. Once again, all the math was done by Onyx and u/IronCobalt42; I just executed it differently.

  
Note: This assumes a uniform calculation across the dial. I don't know much about grinders, burrs, or the Gen 2 specifically to know if this is accurate or not. Things can get super complicated if someone suggests that the grind size changes disproportionally at different settings. This is a good guideline for now. Compared to the chart on Honest Coffee Guide's website, this returns results about 1 setting low. For example, this shortcut will return 4 2/3 for a micron size of 675, but on HCG's chart, that's almost square on 5 2/3. I don't know who is right.

Here's the [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/69acea947d474505996e45ca432e88eb) if you want to try it.",1,1733507921.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

The end result is a combination of 3 sources… For those who have asked about the process, here are the steps I took:

I started with the RewTV episodes, going frame-by-frame to remove all duplicate frames. I then re-timed the image sequence to restore the intended (non-time-compressed) speed of the original broadcast. This gave me my first video layer - a 16:9, properly timed image.

Next, I upscaled the logo-less version of the 4:3 SD episode to match the 720p RewTV baseline. Because this source was also time-compressed, I had to repeat the process of finding and deleting all duplicate frames, then re-timing the image sequence to 23.98fps. (Yes, it *would* have been great if the duplicate frames in the RewTV and the logo-less episodes had been identical, but alas…) Once this was done, I used the bottom right corner of that 4:3 image to obscure the RewTV logo on the base layer, checking to make sure every frame of the two video layers matched up. (They didn't, because *of course* they didn't, so I applied fixes.) Color correction also was applied.

At this point, one might think I could essentially pull in the Laff episode audio (best quality of the three sources) and call it a day, but the RewTV broadcasts suffered from numerous visual glitches as well as overall low image quality. And of course, there was the pesky task of eliminating pop-up ads, so my work continued…

Comparing all three video sources, I found that the Laff episodes had the best, most consistent image quality (even though they're SD, and the RewTV episodes were technically HD). So, after upscaling the Laff episodes to 720p, I was able to sandwich the upscaled Laff image between the other two video layers, and I once again checked to ensure that all frames from every video layer matched up (which, again… they *didn't*, because why would they?). Anywhere the frames didn't match, I made the appropriate adjustments, and I color corrected this layer as well.

Finally, there were at least two instances where a RewTV episode and the logo-less version of that episode had on-screen pop-up ads at the same time. Unfortunately, I couldn't completely rely on the Laff episodes to cover over the portion of the screen that was obscured by both ads, because the Laff logo covered the same area of the screen. Ultimately, for these two instances, I had to digitally re-create the missing portion of the image by creating a still image from a different frame in the episode. I cropped and overlaid it atop the other three video layers, adding motion to the still image to match any camera movement. This did the trick and completed the video restoration process for S07E01-03.

…Oh! I also created subtitles for each episode, but no one asked how I did that, and it's an even more boring walkthrough, so I'll spare you those details.

At this point, I've checked and re-checked these episodes to look for errors, and I haven't found any, but after so many hours, the eyes tend to glaze over. As usual, please let me know if you catch anything I missed so I can put out an updated version of the affected episode(s).

Enjoy, everyone!

The elevator doors slide open, revealing a smiling, handsome uncle radiating the most positive aura imaginable.

****The Routine****:
	- On the way to his desk, he exchanges subtle nods with young men, gives big nods and waves to peers of his age, and reserves warm smiles, waves, and even hugs for young women.
	- With unmatched enthusiasm, he then directs all his energy to crack the “funniest joke of the day” to women his age, ensuring the room erupts with laughter.

****The Office Rituals****:
        - After spreading joy, he dances(slight exaggeration) around before settling into his chair. But not before grabbing a cup of coffee and announcing to the entire office that it’s his second cup of the day.
	 - Bonus detail: The first cup followed a huge “fitness achievement” – a walk around the park (which included gossiping with fellow uncles and discreetly glancing at aunties) before indulging in two thatte idlies soaked in ghee.

****Next Moves****:

1) He stops by his work wife’s desk to tell her she looks beautiful (the sole exception to his routine)
2) Makes rounds to every cubicle with young women, offering compliments generously.
3) Targets an unsuspecting newbie or intern, delivering not-so-funny innuendos to boost his own mood.

****Climactic Scene****:

It feels like it's trendy and acceptable to hate Indians right now. I do not believe this came about organically. There is just no way that Indians went from a model minority that are just funny to being the worst race to ever live (at least on the internet). Why is India that was once (at least in the 1960s) considered a place of spiritual and philosophical education now considered a disgusting no-go-zone? I have not yet encountered this behavior irl, well except one time a guy told me I look like IT tech support (ha ha) and only yesterday the Uber driver asked me where I work. I told him I study computer science at the university. He then asked me when I graduate if I'd be working at the local Walmart. I said I wanted a tech job. But then throughout the entire trip whenever he'd encounter a coffee shop chain, he'd ask me why I don't just work there. The implication was obvious by the end but I did not say anything. It is rather ironic that these very same people claim to care about the caste system while spouting racist rhetoric against the Indian community on Twitter (now X). Why has this happened?

1h86yhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Max_Dividends/comments/1h86yhs/etf_fees_the_hidden_costs_that_are_eating_your/,ETF Fees: The Hidden Costs That Are Eating Your Gains,"So you’re sipping your coffee, scrolling through your investment app, feeling like a financial genius because you’ve parked your cash in an ETF. Smart move, right? Well, hold up. Those low fees that ETF providers love to tout? They might not be as “low” as you think. Let’s dig into the dirty details of what those fees really cost you, and spoiler alert — it’s more than just a fraction of a percent.

[*Follow MaxDividends! Don’t miss out on fresh dividend stock picks and insights!*](https://www.maxdividends.com/)

**“Low Fees”? Not So Fast**

The average fee for U.S.-based ETFs is **0.41% per year** — sounds like chump change, right? But here’s the kicker: it’s not just about the number on paper. Let me break it down into three realities that might make you rethink how “cheap” those ETFs really are.

1. **Fees Are Based on Assets, Not Profits** Here’s the harsh truth: even if your ETF delivers a meager 3% annual return, a 1% fee isn’t just 1% of your profits — it’s **33% of your profits**. Yep, you’re handing over a third of your gains to the fund manager just for holding the privilege of investing in their fund.
2. **You Pay Whether You Win or Lose** Market down? Sideways? Doesn’t matter. That fee keeps ticking along like a hungry meter. Your ETF manager gets paid even when you don’t see a dime of return. Think about the lost decades — like the early 2000s — when the market basically moved sideways. You’d have shelled out fees the entire time, watching your portfolio stagnate while the fund manager kept cashing in.
3. **Daily Deductions, Compounded Over Time** ETFs don’t wait until December 31st to grab their cut. They take a little slice every single day. That 1% annual fee? It’s split across 365 days, slowly eating into your portfolio daily. Over time, this compounds in the wrong direction, reducing not just your current holdings but also the future gains you could have earned on those funds.

**Case Study: The Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL)**

Let’s put some numbers behind this. Take **NOBL**, the ETF that tracks the Dividend Aristocrats. It advertises a fee of **0.35% annually**, but that’s just the start. As the years pile on, the real cost starts to balloon.

* Investors holding NOBL for 8 years have effectively paid **0.45% annually**, not 0.35%.
* If you extrapolate:
* **20 years in**, the average annual fee climbs to **0.69%**.
* **50 years in**, it’s a whopping **2.03%** — that’s about **29% of your profits**.

Why? Because of the opportunity cost of compounding. The money you lose to fees doesn’t just disappear — it stops working for you, and the gap widens over time.

**But Wait, It Gets Worse: High Fees in Disguise**

Now, let’s look at the extremes. Some ETFs charge much more than the average. You could be looking at **1–2% annual fees**, which over decades can suck up 5–10% of your portfolio’s potential. Even seemingly harmless funds can stealthily eat into your returns if you hold them long enough.

**What’s the Alternative?**

1. **Go DIY with Individual Stocks** If you’re a long-term dividend investor, building your own portfolio might save you big. Direct stock purchases cut out the middleman, meaning you avoid ETF fees altogether. But this strategy comes with its own risks — like stock-picking mistakes or failing to diversify properly.
2. **Stick to Ultra-Low Fee ETFs** Thanks to competition, ETF fees are dropping. Over the last four years, fees have fallen by **25%**, according to Morningstar. Many funds now charge less than **0.1% annually**, making them much more reasonable for long-term holders.

**Who’s Really Paying the Price?**

If you’re planning to hold your ETF investments for 10–20 years, you might not feel the pinch. But if your plan is to pass that portfolio on to your kids or grandkids, those fees will snowball into a serious hit to their inheritance.

**The Bottom Line**

ETFs are a fantastic tool for most investors — they’re easy, diversified, and low-maintenance. But don’t let the simplicity lull you into complacency. Those seemingly small fees can add up to massive losses over time, especially if you’re investing for the long haul.

So, whether you’re sticking with ETFs or venturing into the world of individual stocks, keep your eyes open and your calculator handy. Because at the end of the day, it’s not about what you earn — it’s about what you keep. And no one wants their portfolio’s gains gobbled up by “hidden” fees.

Now Everyone Is Acting Strange…,"I woke up this morning with a raging headache. I was out late last night celebrating landing a big account at work, and afterward I’d come straight home and crashed, barely even keeping my eyes open long enough to make it inside my apartment. I took an aspirin, showered, and dressed, watching a YouTube clip from yesterday about the explosion at T Coronae Borealis. Amazing how the explosion of a white dwarf 3,000 light years away could get so much attention here and now. But I guess “new stars” don’t come along every day - more like every eighty years, according to the experts. 

I left my apartment and saw Ms. Simmons standing in the hallway. *Great.* I usually avoided her; she was a retiree who didn’t have much to do since her kids moved away and always wanted to gossip about the neighbors. Gossip wasn’t really my thing, but she was so lonely that she was hard to say ‘no’ to, so I often ended up trapped listening to her go on about who said what or who went where or who wronged whom. But today, she just looked at me with a weird smile, light glinting off her eyes. Too relieved to look a gift horse in the mouth, I briefly greeted her and jogged to the stairs, thankful for the reprieve. 

I left my building and walked to the subway station. Without paying much attention to anyone around me, I swiped my pass and boarded the train. As I sat in the car, something seemed different than usual. It took a second, but then I realized what it was. The noise I was used to - people chattering on their phones, playing videos, speaking rudely to each other - was gone. It was completely silent. I looked up and realized why - no one on the entire train was talking. Instead, they were all staring. 

At me. 

And they all had the same look on their faces - a warped, disturbed smile, like they were seeing something that wasn’t part of this world. 

Freaked out, I hurried off the train, wanting to get away as quickly as possible. But as I walked down the street, I noticed more and more people looking at me the same way. And some of their eyes shone with an unnatural light. I started running, bursting through the door of my office. I’d made it. 

“Hey, Matt. What’s going on? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I looked up and saw Jim, one of my best friends. We’d met here five years ago when we’d both been interns, and we’d been fast friends ever since. If there was anyone I could talk to, it was him. 

“Man, you wouldn’t believe the morning I’ve had! Have you noticed anything weird today?”

“Weird like what?” 

“Just… people acting strange, not like themselves.”

Jim rubbed his chin in contemplation. “Well, Jenny at the coffee shop put a little heart over the i in my name on my coffee this morning. Does that count as weird?”

I sighed in relief. If he hadn’t seen anything, then everything was probably fine. 

“No, I think that just means she has a thing for you. You should ask for her number.”

“What?” he responded in surprise. “No way, man. You’re crazy.”

Ok, man,” I replied. “If you say so. But when the new year comes and you’re still single, don’t say I didn’t try to help.”

Relaxing, I went into the kitchenette to make my morning coffee (I didn’t share Jim’s morning Starbucks habit - I’d rather save the money and retire someday). Afterward I returned to my desk and started working. 

Around lunchtime, Jim came over and sat on the corner of my desk like he always did when he wanted to shoot the breeze. 

“So…?”

“Yes?”

“What you said about Jenny this morning. Were you just kidding, or..”

Good Lord. “Dude, if you *really* don’t see it, you’re too blind to do this job. ASK. HER. OUT.”

He looked toward the ground, clearly nervous and unsure of how to go forward. I was about to give him some tips when I realized something. 

The office had gone silent.

I don’t mean “everyone is focused on their work” silent. I mean “someone cut off the volume on the tv” silent. I looked up, and my coworkers were looking our way.

And they were smiling.

Without looking at him, I said “Jim, we need to get out of here. Now.”

“Relax, man. We can head out to lunch in a few. I just need to get this last report in for Williamson.”

“No,” I said, starting to worry. They were coming closer. “We need to get out of here. RIGHT. FUCKING. NOW. There’s no time to explain - I need you to trust me on this.”

He looked like he wanted to ask a question, but I guess the look of sheer panic on my face persuaded him. 

“OK, man. Whatever you say.”

“Great,” I said, standing up and heading for the door. “This way.”

I began to walk slowly and calmly toward the door, hoping not to push them into any sudden action. Jim followed along, matching my pace. But I could see some of them moving toward the door, and I knew that soon they’d cut us off and we’d have no way out. 

With no time to think, I acted on instinct. I ran for the door. Although confused, Jim ran to keep up with me, but was looking at me with confusion. 

“Why are we runni—”

“No time! Just trust me - we have to go!”

He seemed a bit skeptical, but he kept running. Unfortunately, our coworkers started running, too, and there were more of them. I made it through the door just in time with Jim right behind me. 

We ran out onto the street, but there was a mob of smiling figures. They turned toward us as soon as we stepped out, as if some sixth sense had alerted them to our presence. As one, they raised their arms and moved toward us. 

“What the hell is happening?” Jim asked, confused and panicking. 

“Keep running!” I scream-whispered back. 

We rounded a corner and ducked into an alleyway. We had lost them. I looked at Jim - he was a combination of scared shitless and completely befuddled. 

“What the hell was that?” he whispered. 

“That’s what I was freaked out about when I got to work this morning.  All day, I’ve been seeing people with that freaky smile chasing after me. And I could swear that some of their eyes were glowing. I don’t know what it means. But I know I can’t let them catch me.”

“Do we know what’s wrong with them?”

“No idea,” I replied. “I’m really not anxious to go up to one and ask.”

He nodded at that and leaned back, thinking silently. But the silence didn’t last. We heard another person running down the street away from them. He tried to cross the street and jump the fence, but the crowd caught him. I thought about going to help him, but there were at least thirty of them. What could I do?

Before I knew it, the crowd was laying him down on the ground. They held down his arms and legs so he couldn’t move, and then one of them held his head, forcing him to face upward, while another pried his eyes open. 

I’ll never forget his screams.

After a few minutes, he stopped screaming. Then the crowd backed away and he stood up. He was the same as before, but not. He looked calm, sure of himself. And on his face was the same smile as the others, the smile that said he knew everything and had no cares in the world. 

I looked behind me and Jim wore a look of abject terror. 

“What…?  What?”

“That’s what I was trying to ask you about this morning. When I asked if you’d seen anyone acting strange? People are walking around like zombies with these weird smiles on their faces. Some of them chased me this morning before I got to the office.”

“But what would have caused any of this?” 

“I’m not sure. The news was talking about some weird explosion in space that was visible from here last night - I think this was one of the only places it could be seen clearly. I don’t know, that sounds crazy to me, but I can’t think of anything else. Can you?”

Jim was silent. 

“And now that I think about it, I think whatever it is got my neighbor, too. She was acting weird this morning.”

I could see him trying to absorb these new developments. He took several deep breaths to get a hold of himself. 

“OK, say I believe… any of this. What do we do?”

“Well,” I said, thinking it through. “We can either get some weapons and go on the attack, find a place to hole up and hope it blows over, or find a car and get out of dodge.”

“Do we have any weapons?” Jim asked. 

“No,” I replied. “And there are way more of them than there are of us.”

“Do we have a car?”

“Not that I can get to without going back through them. I don’t think that’s such a good idea.”

“Do we know if it’s actually going to blow over?”

“I really hope so, but we don’t know anything for certain.” I replied. 

“Then I vote for option 2,” he said with determination.

With that, we started looking for a place to hide out. We moved quickly and quietly, trying not to draw their attention. We dismissed several places - too many points of entry, doors or windows we couldn’t secure, etc. At one point, we hopped over a fence and Jim landed flat on his back. I was worried, but after a couple of minutes he got up and we kept moving. Eventually we got lucky and found an abandoned automotive shop that looked like it went out of business with a lot of the inventory still here. We locked the doors and windows, found the best vantage point to make sure no one snuck up on us, and holed up for the duration. 

Later that night, I woke up to a strange sound. I didn’t know what it was, but then I looked over. Jim was standing up facing in my direction, and in the moonlight I could just make out his face. 

He was smiling. 

*Crap.*

“Jim, man, are you ok?”

He didn’t say anything, just started creeping toward me. 

*Double crap.*

“Jim, listen to me. Whatever is going on, I really need you to fight it, ok buddy? You’re still you.”

Nothing. 

“Were friends, right? Remember when we met as interns? When we both were completely overwhelmed after that first intern meeting and went out that night and got drunk together?”

He said nothing, but the creepy smile remained. 

It had definitely gotten him. But when? We’d been together all da— Oh. When he’d tripped before, he’d landed on his back. Facing the sky. *Dammit.*

I looked around the room, looking for anything I could use as a weapon to defend myself. 

Nothing. 

He was getting closer. I tried talking to him again. 

“Jim, stay back. If you keep coming, this is going to go badly.”

If anything, the smile widened. He kept coming. 

I looked around. The exit was about five yards past him - if I could get to it, I could make a break for it and probably outrun him. I didn’t know who else was out there, but at this point I’d take my chances. 

I ran toward him and made a last-minute move to go around him, but as I was almost past I felt a pain in my stomach and hit the ground. I was laying on the ground, dazed but knowing I needed to get up. And then I felt hands encircle my neck and squeeze. 

I tried to fight him off, but he seemed to have an unnatural strength and I couldn’t break his grip. His eyes began to take in a strange glow, and then he stopped squeezing, grabbed me by my legs, and started dragging me. 

Towards the door to the outside. Towards the sky. 

I knew if he got me out there, I’d be done for. Looking for any chance, I saw a forgotten wrench laying on the ground. If I could only reach it…

My fingers dragged across it and I lifted it and hit the thing-that-used-to-be-Jim in the back as hard as I could. 

He didn’t even flinch. 

What the hell *was* he?

He kept moving, so I hit him again, this time in the arms. His grip loosened and I pulled free. 

I stood to face him. He looked back at me, completely calm. The man I knew was gone - this thing looked at me with an unnatural expression on his face. Manic. Demented. Evil. 

Suddenly he jumped at me. I couldn’t believe how fast he moved. But I was ready. I waited until he was almost at me and then slid to the side and swung at his head as hard as I could. 

There was a crunch and he went down. Taking no chances, I swung again. And again. 

Finally, he stopped moving. I looked down and saw his face pointed up at me. 

The sight of his eyes faintly glowing, face twisted into a macabre grin as blood dripped down his skull, will stay with me until the day I die. 

Afterward, I knew I couldn’t stay there. I don’t know when more would be coming, I didn’t have supplies, and I wasn’t willing to stay with the body. I sat there, gathering my strength, and went outside after dark. After a mile, I lucked on an abandoned truck with the keys still in it. I drove as far as I could, stopping for gas and food when it seemed clear, and ended up in a small town on the other side of the country. People here are quiet, they keep to themselves, and they don’t look at the sky. 

Since I got here, I’ve been looking on the internet, and I don’t see any reports of anything like this happening elsewhere. I don’t even see any info on it happening in my town. I’ve written everything down so I know it was real. I don’t understand how this happened. I don’t know why it only happened in my old town - there was nothing special about it, it was just like any other. And I don’t know if it’s over. 

But I know three things. I’ll never look at the sky the same way again. If you’re smart, neither will you. 

And if you hear of something strange in the heavens, or if the people you thought you knew start acting strangely…

*RUN.*

My friends and family are on my back about it now and it’s really stressing me out.

All the way through schools I’ve tended to have not great interactions with the guys in my life. One of the guys jokingly asked me out when I was 11 and I was bullied about this until I left school. 

At uni - there were guys interested which was nice. The first put his hand up my top the night we met. the second one told everyone we slept together over the summer (we went for one walk together while at uni where nothing happened). The third cornered me at a dance and tried to kiss me (I’d met him 5 minutes before this) and I had to move his arm away and run to my friends. The fourth was nice and lovely and smart and we got on - but has major hard drug issues which put me off. And the fourth was one of my friends who dragged me away from our friends when at a club and put his hand up my top which really freaked me out. The fifth was lovely and I really liked him but he would always go home with a different girl after getting close and dancing with me all night on nights out. The final one said he was into the fact I hadn’t don’t anything with a guy and that I was petite and innocent which actually scared me.

In an ideal world, I’d like to go out to coffee with a guy and get to know him before anything more happened. I don’t tend to feel attracted enough to anyone before getting to know them.

My mother is saying I’m being too picky and harsh and that I just need a guy to be a good project and I can work on him through the years. But I don’t think I can work on issues that I’ve had with the guys mentioned previously. I think that’s something they need to work on themselves. But now I’m starting to think I am being too picky. 

These also seem to be the only guys I attract. I don’t know whether I should just settle with one of them or not. I don’t want to have to work on someone else while also trying to improve myself and work on my career and hobbies too though. 

If anyone has any advice that would be great. I’m just feeling that I might not find anyone if I don’t settle for someone like the guys I’ve met previously. ",4,1733505798.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

I work as a shift leader at what is essentially the Utah equivalent of a Starbucks/Dunkin, and while I enjoy my work the base pay is brutally low ($9/hr, with tips I usually make around $14/hr) and I just need to break into something different in order to survive.

The hours are also much less demanding than my current position.

1. I am really sad. My life is really hard. I don’t have interest in smiling in pictures right now. I smile and laugh often in real life. I’m generally a very happy person, despite these pics lol. But my life is very hard and I have a lot of hurt and pain to deal with on the daily. So if your only advice is to smile, heard. 

2. I work three jobs and I don’t like taking pics of myself like this but I do it every once in a while to keep track of what I look like so I can look better:) most of these pics are me at home or the gym, wearing very casual clothes or pajamas and my hair is not done etc. there’s one pic of me at a job I had I drew out the logo haha. I normally wear a mix of gothic/coquette/dark academia esk clothing or t shirts. I’m not really here for fashion advice, just for advice regarding my face and colors. Thank you.

3. My lips are just shaped like that. I can’t help it. When I got my freshman year yearbook photo, I noticed how much my lips pout and I hated it. I don’t hate it anymore, but I promise you I’m not making any kind of face on purpose whether you wanna believe me or not. The comments were filled with people telling me about my lips. I swear to god my lips just look like this. If I could make them look more elongated and less pouty and weirdly shaped I would. This is literally my mouth. 


Besides all of that, I’m 20F, I eat really clean mostly plant based but with a focus on protein so lots of fruits, vegetables, legumes, vegan protein powder, eggs, fish. I drink lots of water and also drink spearmint tea and peppermint tea and decaf coffee. I don’t drink soda, sometimes sparkling water. I eat in a very extreme calorie deficit because I’m 5’2 and every pound difference shows sadly. I’m 110 lbs right now but I look my best around the 106 area. I don’t sleep well. I’ve been better at sleeping earlier but I have nightmares from my trauma and sleep paralysis sometimes as well. I am under a lot of stress daily, I work like crazy and take care of my baby sister. One of my jobs is also babysitting so I take care of lots of children which ads to my stress (I can handle it though I’m very good with kids and I studied early childhood education in high school which helped a lot as well. I never take out my stress on them.) anyyyywayyys I also go to the gym whenever I can, I would say an average of four times a week but sometimes more if I have time. I love cardio but I know weight lifting is important so I’ve been trying this year to learn how to do it better. I’d say it’s going ok. I’m not really here for advice on my body though, just my face.

Just telling you this to give you a picture of my health. I always had very clear skin but suddenly in September I started getting hormonal acne and I don’t know why. I’m very hygienic, don’t touch my face, and wash my pillowcases regularly/always shower if I’m sweaty. It’s very disheartening for me as I try so hard to keep my health bill clean. 

I don’t wear skin makeup currently but I’m trying to learn how to do it to look more polished. I wear mascara and a tiny bit of shadow under my eyes with lip tint and gloss. I cleanse my face and moisturize with vitamin c and use a gua shua. I’m trying to learn how to do natural makeup better but it always looks wrong on me. I do much better with heavy alt makeup but I’m not showing that here lol because I don’t have the mental capacity to hear everyone’s opinion on that. 


One last thing, my hair is naturally blonde but I dye it black. I really prefer the black but I’ve been feeling very low and lost about my self esteem so if you have suggestions I’m here to listen 

I just want to know what are my flaws, my best options for improvement, options for surgery, anything majorly wrong you think when you see my face? (Besides my mouth that apparently the population hates) and how I can look better. I really just want to be beautiful. It’s a big wish of mine.

That last one is just something I happened to run into at a visit to Sheetz not too long ago. Right next to the entrance was a shelf of baked goodies, offering individually wrapped slices of *Coffee House Pound Cake* from Prairie City Bakery. They came in two flavors, iced lemon and chocolate-iced chocolate; both of which I bought in yet another bout of my trademark impulsive purchasing ability.

Much to my enjoyment, both selections turned out to be soft, moist confections that I expect from any cake. The iced lemon variety benefits from its mixture of acidic and sweet flavors, while the chocolate-iced chocolate option nicely doubles up on its primary attraction. A tall glass of cold white milk serves to be a wonderful partner to each. Definitely gonna grab these again in the future.

enough with the overpriced nonsense.

1h869ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/moving/comments/1h869ru/cali_is_costly_need_recommendations_for_dream_city/,Cali is costly. Need recommendations for DREAM city! ,"Hi! So I'm born/raised in Orange County, CA and the cost of living is insane but I stayed mainly because my family is here, but they all have kids now... 
I'm 33 years old, single/no kids, and want to move out of state to somewhere that has a New York kind of vibe maybe, without the New York price tag. Here's some things I'm thinking but have little ideas on where is the best:

-high rise apartments, maybe with a doorman! :)

-snow is totally great, even welcomed!! 

-people mainly walk everywhere, grab coffee, say hello, and KNOW each other 

-there's lots of city activities to do (yoga, outdoorsy, nightlife..)

-GREAT if no state income tax!!

-not too big of a city where you're lost & lonely, but enough people to connect with friends and new faces often :)


I've been mentioned Denver, Tennessee, Salt Lake - but would love if people have personal experience in places!! 

If I can narrow it down to 2-3 good locations, I am planning to take a trip next year to each of them!! Then make the decision to MOVE out of Cali!! Open from East to West Coast. 

Main thing is COST of LIVING needs to be cheaper (would love to pay $1300/mo for apartment, on the low-end it is $1500/mo just to share one WITH roommates here).

Any suggestions on my new DREAM city location?! :)

It eventually became so stressful that I would wake up on birthdays and holidays feeling sick.

Now as an adult I usually won’t participate in gift exchanges if it’s possible to decline without offending anybody and I discourage gifts being given to me on my birthdays or during the holidays. 

Gift giving is hard too. I take environmental conservation very seriously and I am also a minimalist. Christmas in general is truly abhorrent to me when it comes to wasted resources and the production of products that will all very likely end up in a landfill/the ocean very soon.

I don’t want to participate in that. I wish Christmas was like thanksgiving in the US and everybody could just get together and eat and enjoy each other’s company. I tried to get out of Christmas gifts last year by asking that others don’t buy me anything and if they feel they must then to please pay it forward to somebody else with a random act of kindness but nobody listened to me and because other people are giving me gifts (even though I don’t want them) I feel I have to return the favor, it feels inappropriate not to.

I don’t want any person in my life to feel left out but a lot of people I just don’t know what they would want and I don’t want to purchase some junk I know they probably won’t use and might not even like just as a symbol that I value them.

Luckily I became a mom last year and this year everybody is getting coffee mugs with my sons face on them. I think that they will be used and appreciated. Also I think I will just continue to do this every year so that my loved ones all have a growing collection of mugs that picture my son as he grows up. I feel really excited and relieved at this idea.

I just wanted to share all of this because I figured others might relate and might like the mug idea. Happy holidays! 🎄",1,1733504856.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

1h865d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingDariusCoin/comments/1h865d5/huge_token_expansion_incomingbrace_yourselves_for/,Huge Token Expansion Incoming—Brace Yourselves for the 1 Trillion Supply Era!,"Hey KDC Fam,  
Your community leader here, and I’ve got some earth-shattering news: we’re thinking of **going from 1 billion tokens to 1 TRILLION**. Yes, you read that right—“1 trillion” with a T!

Now, before you spit out your coffee or drop your phone, let me explain. We’re not just going big, we’re going colossal. In fact, we’re going so far beyond colossal that we’re practically inventing new words for how massive this move is. “Epically monstrous” might cover it—but let’s just say it’ll make old supply counts look like child’s play.

**Here’s the plan:**

* **1 Trillion Tokens:** The new supply is designed to bring more people in on the action, spread the love, and build a more inclusive ecosystem.
* **Mega Airdrops:** To reward our active community members (that’s you!), we’ll be raining tokens down like confetti at a victory parade. You’ve stuck around, believed in the project, and supported each other—now it’s time you get a piece of this giant pie.
* **Enhanced Community Impact:** By distributing this massive supply among you, we’re not just fueling whales; we’re empowering the entire school of fish. Everyone gets to swim in these prosperous waters!

**But Why Now?**  
We want to ensure that as we grow, everyone who’s been an early believer gets rewarded. More tokens mean more ways to engage in the project, participate in governance, and show the rest of the cryptosphere that KDC doesn’t just dream big—it *lives* big.

**What’s Next?**

* Keep your eyes peeled for official announcements, exact timelines, and details on how you can qualify for the airdrops.
* Get excited. Like, *really excited.* This isn’t just another step; it’s a leap so huge we’ll need a bigger measuring tape to track it.

So, buckle up, my friends. We’re cranking the dial from “ambitious” to “holy-cow-this-is-insane.” If anyone doubted that KDC would shake the cryptoverse, well… let’s just say this will send their jaw straight through the floor.

The future’s about to get a whole lot bigger—1 trillion times bigger, in fact. Stay tuned!",1,1733504723.0,KingDariusCoin,0,1.0,False

>  
Ah, Madison, Wisconsin—the place where the cows outnumber the people, but the people still manage to be the most confused about where they’re from. It's like a college town where the university is both the biggest thing in town *and* the thing no one wants to admit they’re part of. You have the Capitol building, sure, but no one’s really sure what’s going on in there—except maybe people trying to decide if it's too cold to bike to work.

>And let’s not forget the ""progressive"" reputation—Madison is like that friend who wears a hemp shirt and talks about yoga, but ends up running on 100% coffee and protesting at every chance. If you’re not participating in the latest local food trend or environmental cause, what *are* you doing with your life? It’s like a perpetual ""find yourself"" retreat.

>Then there’s the weather. Oh, the weather! The air is a fine mix of snow, ice, and wind. One minute you’re basking in a semi-warm sun, and the next, it’s a full-on blizzard. You could be wearing shorts, and then—bam!—polar vortex. It's like Mother Nature’s way of keeping people on their toes—or just making sure no one ever gets used to anything.

>And the locals—oh boy. Madison folks will give you the rundown on the best local brewery or the best lake to kayak in about 5 seconds. But they’re always a little too proud of their “underdog” sports teams, considering the Badgers’ lack of national titles. It’s cute, though—they believe, and in a town like Madison, that’s half the battle.

>But hey, despite all the quirks, there’s still something oddly charming about it. Just don’t ask for directions unless you’ve got an hour to spare, and prepare for the never-ending battle between “nice” and “midwestern nice.”",0,1733504676.0,wisconsin,3,0.19,False

1h863u7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h863u7,Received a Suspicious COD Package I Never Ordered – What Should I Do?,"Yesterday, while I was at work, a package was delivered to my home via Delhivery. I never order anything on Cash on Delivery (COD), but my parents were home and assumed it was a usual package of mine since it had my full name, complete address, mobile number, and email on it. Without thinking much, they paid the COD amount of ₹699 and took the delivery.

Here’s where it gets weird:
	•	The package had no sender address or invoice—just my details and the COD amount written on it.
	•	When my parents sent me a picture of the package, I was shocked because I hadn’t ordered anything like this.
	•	The product inside turned out to be some third-grade “teeth whitening serum” with an MRP of ₹1,999, but it honestly looks more like a bottle of sanitizer.

I’m unsure how this happened or how to proceed. My concerns:
	1.	Is this a scam? How did they get all my details?
	2.	What steps can I take now? Can I report this to Delhivery or any authority?
	3.	Has anyone else faced a similar situation?

Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated!",22,1733504615.0,hyderabad,16,0.92,False
1h862vf,https://i.redd.it/nu82bo11f95e1.jpeg,Inherited Artwork - Damaged in catastrophic house fire. Need help with valuation for insurance. Second try with pic this time.,"Second attempt - photo included this time

Hi, l'm new here and hope this is the right
subreddit and that I'm not breaking any rules. My grandparents lived overseas for much of their lives including France, Japan, and Vietnam. They had the most amazing house full of treasures and discoveries on every wall and in every drawer. I loved wandering and they let me snoop all I wanted. After they passed, I inherited a great deal of these treasures. Some are worthless to
anyone but me and other things are wildly valuable such as a hand carved marble coffee table commissioned by my grandma from a tradesman in Japan. I've never had any intention to sell any of it despite encouragement from others because
I want my home to also be filled with an eclectic bounty of oddities, curiosities, fine art, and more.

Tragically, we experienced a catastrophic house fire about 3 weeks ago. It destroyed our second floor and caused damage throughout the home. We lost two of our beloved furry family members: our dog and one of our cats. Our smallest kitty was the only survivor. We are grieving hard for
them.

We are having to inventory everything deemed
non-salvageable for our insurance claim. I would like to at least give this item a fair value. My mom tried to have it appraised because it is an original but there was not enough information on the piece. I am by no means an art expert but I would guess this was purchased in Paris, France, If not in
France, then somewhere on the East Coast US.

Does anyone have any recommendations for
pricing this piece? Thank you!",1,1733504551.0,artcollecting,0,1.0,False

We will be holding the ceremony at a church in the suburb of Sale. 

In a dream world, we would have loved to have approximately 60 people, choose our own catering and have enough room for a ceilidh... But starting to think that's not possible on a £10K total budget! So prepared to reduce the number of people, go with venue catering and ditch the ceilidh (though live music would still be amazing if possible...). I'm thinking maybe a pub/restaurant vibe might be cosy and pleasant for a more intimate gathering. We are aiming for February 2026 so can't be outside and will need some heating. 

Cutting costs by making my own dress, M&S cake, digital invites, doing my own makeup, no florals, no bridesmaids. But also spending more by wanting live music at the ceremony. Church ceremony is £400 (church + minister). That doesn't include tea/coffee/biscuits after or legal/registrar fees for the marriage licence.

My boyfriend texted me that morning and wished me a happy birthday and asked if he could take me out for breakfast. I thanked him and asked if we could do lunch instead (I already ate cake for breakfast that my grandma made for me because cake and coffee 🤷🏼‍♀️) He replied and said ""Yes, just let me know when you're free."" I called him around 10:40 and he said, ""I wish you would have called about 3 minutes ago. I'm about to eat a sandwich."" I said, ""Oh, I thought we were going out for lunch, but I guess I can find something here to make instead."" He said, ""You can drive over here. I have plenty of food to make.""

I told him the place I wanted to go closes at 8:00 PM. He told me he would only be babysitting for an hour and we would go after he was done. He was still babysitting at 8:00 so I told him I was going to bed and to have a good night. He didn't talk to me all day yesterday. Then he called me this morning and text and asked if I was mad or something...I let him know I was hurt, disappointed, and confused that he didn't want to spend time with me on my birthday and he responded and asked if he could come pick up his Dad's ladder he left here...AITA?

The key for me is to drink your coffee before taking your medication and wait about two hours afterward before taking Vyvanse. However, the crucial detail is to use low-acid coffee.

I found that coffee beans from Sumatra are naturally very low in acidity, making them ideal for people with sensitive stomachs. Switching to high-quality, low-acid Sumatra coffee beans has made a significant difference for me.

Since making this change, my daily stomach issues have completely disappeared. Now, I can enjoy my morning coffee, wait two hours, take my Vyvanse, and feel great all day. This simple adjustment has been a total game-changer!",1,1733504139.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36 yof my boyfriend Matt is a 42 yom. Between the two of us there are three children my biological daughter Jenny is the youngest she is 11, his daughter Anna is 13 and his son Tim is 15. We have been living together for two and a half years.  For a little bit of context we live in a small town, although he is older than me I know his ex who’s his age. Not from the same friend groups, but I was friends with her sister in my early college years. My friend Amanda never had nice things to say about her sister Linda his x. Amanda and I became close we did vacations together even some holidays our parents even became friends. Over time she finished college and took a position with a company that has her traveling a lot. We stayed in contact through social media, but I also moved out of state after my husbanded cheated on me and was having a baby with another woman. We had only been married for a year and a half before I found out about his infidelity. It broke my heart we had been together since we were 15. So I started a new life in a big city met a man and became pregnant with my beautiful daughter at 26. Right before Covid I moved back to my hometown after leaving a very abusive relationship. I had kept to myself and spent my time back home restarting our life’s, focusing on my daughter and myself healing. It had been about 2 years of being home at this point. My daughter had talked me in to taking her to the high school play the following week. I had at that point made my public appearances slim. The night of the play I’d gotten out of work and was rushing to get ready slapped on some jeans and boots and we ran out the door. Of course, as soon as we get to the theater, my daughter abandon me for her group of friends. So there I was sitting by myself and I noticed Matt. We smiled at each other. I not thinking he’s going to know who I am or remember me continued to gaze around the room. The play soon started and my daughter returned to sit with me. Then a few weeks later, my friend Sam invites us to her son’s football game. I was finally starting to get out of my little hole and engage in social activities. So I packed up and we headed to the football field as I’m walking to the setting area there’s Matt and a guy I recognize from school. Again, Matt turned and smiled at me this time waving. I smiled and waved back, but continued walking to meet up with my friend Sam. I had noticed several times during the football game Matt looking our way. She also noticed the glances from Matt during the game. After the game, Sam and I are walking to our cars chasing kids. She looks up at me and says did you notice Matt eyeing you? I laughed it off and said yeah, but him and Linda are married, right? She said no they haven’t been together for like five years,  she proceeds to say Matt is a really sweet guy. She didn’t go into great detail about how much Linda screwed him over, but there was cheating,  manipulation and abuse. Later that evening while scrolling on the book Matt popped up in the people you may know category. I did know him so I dropped that tissue. It didn’t take him long to accept. A few days had gone by and I get a message from Matt asking if I’d like to hang out sometime. We went on the most amazing dates a little rough around the edges, but such a sweet man I fell head over heels for him total opposite of any man I’ve ever dated. Before we decided to move in together, we had a lot of conversations about our children. Including issues he had, had in the past with his daughter getting in between his relationship with his x of two years. It didn’t take long for Anna to start the drama with my daughter and me. Of course there was plenty to say from her mother regarding me her sister‘s friend.  I had no crush on Matt wasn’t even interested in him nor did I really even know him 16 years ago. There isn’t that much of an age gap between us just six years but that did not stop the rumors from Linda. I helped Matt overcome lots of hurdles with Linda, including getting more time with his kids. Matt did not fight in the divorce and pretty much let Linda have everything the house the car he was always the main breadwinner in the relationship, and Linda walked all over him. Since the beginning of our relationship he was open and honest about how much he regretted not standing up for himself. And how she still tries to run his life with the kids. After two years of working on my life I know a manipulating, narcissistic parent isn’t easy to navigate. Anna was having behavior issues, failing almost every class causing drama at home and school. Matt and I had plenty of conversations of how to reinforce a positive home environment when Anna was here. Tim much like his father has a very reserved personality very sweet boy, but he’s also walked on by his mother. The last few years we have had issues with Anna bullying my daughter lying about situations and always playing the victim after things don’t turn out her way. I stand my ground with Anna and let her know she’s in a loving but reinforcing home and everybody is accountable for their actions. My daughter was being a little mouthy the other day and was refusing to help with any of her chores, so I took her phone and had it charging in my office. The next morning I get up and I’m having my coffee and I grab her phone. I see she has a text from Anna who’s at her mom‘s house until this evening. Anna had sent her screenshots from a girl at school that Anna is bullying. Lots of information in the several screenshots. So I sent them to myself and forward them from my phone to Matt. I didn’t want him thinking that my daughter was causing drama as I wasn’t sure he knew I had her phone. I then decided I was going to check the rest of their conversations. I found screenshots that Anna had sent to my daughter of her bullying my boyfriend’s ex’s daughter Sara who is 9. She was telling this poor little girl that her mom left her because she’s a cheater and she’s a fat b. and she’s never gonna be anything because her mom left her. Horrible things I cried for this little girl reading these text messages. Part of the reason Matt and this woman broke up was because she wanted to move out of state leaving all the kids, including hers. Which she did a few months after her and Matt split the little girl is living with her grandma.  Upon reading these screenshots, I noticed one of them said Jenny my daughter was also texting her from Anna’s phone. Saying horrible things my daughter had never met  poor Sara. This really upset me that Anna could encourage my daughter to say such horrible things to this little girl. I confronted my daughter as soon as she got home from school before Anna arrived and she told me she in fact did write some of the horrible text with Anna‘s encouragement. This isn’t the first time that Anna has manipulated my daughter. So I reached out to our family community. I called Matt‘s mom. Read the text messages from Anna word for word and asked her opinion on what to do next. I was pretty uncomfortable reading these text messages, Matt‘s mom is a very strong Christian woman. She told me that Matt and I needed to have a very firm conversation with Anna on where we stand with her behaviors and choices. So before bedtime last night, Matt Anna and myself had a long conversation we found out not only is Anna bullying. She has a 34 grade point average in school for the first quarter. Anna denied any of her actions she denied bullying, she denied lying. She even denied sending the text to Sara saying it was a different Sara and that it was all my daughter that was texting not her. She cried she manipulated her dad and tried to weasel her way out of anything without taking any ownership. I was furious. Every time something was pointed out to her that she had done Anna had an excuse of why that was her behavior. There was no reasoning or understanding that was just the choice she made for retaliation. I then looked her in her eyes and sat forward and told her I know what it’s like to feel always the victim. I know what it’s like to have so much anger and hatred and you don’t know what to do with it. I know what it’s like to want to hurt somebody because you’re hurting. I tried my best to make my point in that moment that she needed a better counselor someone she could really talk to about all this anger and hatred that she holds. She started to cry and agreed. I told her how selfish she was how mean she was how evil it was to talk to such a little girl with hateful big words and that she wasn’t a good role model to be around my daughter. I also told her I was not giving her one damn thing for Christmas. This is when the tears really started. I told her because of her actions, words, behaviors, grades and lack of ownership.  I could not respect that and refuse to give her any gifts. This was a major blow for her because any gift I get her, she absolutely loves. I’m a very thoughtful person and usually listen very well and have a nag for finding perfect gifts for people. Last year she told everyone, including her mom that my gifts were her most favorite. So I know this is the best consequence for her actions. I hadn’t talked to Matt about my decision, I kind of made it in the moment he did agree with me. That’s when it hit me. I’m not Matt‘s wife, I am his live in girlfriend it’s not my place to continually have to lay down the law with his kids. He doesn’t even contact their mom to make detailed plans for Holidays he’s always allowing everyone else to take responsibility for the kids. We had in-depth conversations regarding his daughter, her behavior, the manipulation from his ex-wife, how she still runs the household here and he allows it. For two years I have had to play stepmom and make his daughter accountable and he just sits by and goes along with it. Last night, I said everything to her and he just reinforced it. I told him how this is really putting a damper on things that I’m his girlfriend not the kids stepmom and if I was their stepmom I would be even more disappointed with the lack of help from him. He made it clear from the beginning of the relationship that we would have a committed relationship, but he couldn’t offer me anything more. No marriage no children just living together. So last night, I told him I’m stepping back, there was no future for our relationship just a long-term commitment and I’m doing wife things for a man who just wanted to live with me. I buy all the groceries, Cook all the meals do the laundry, clean the house. Take care of everything work around schedules with games and schooling events all while working a full time job. Three years ago when we started dating, I was OK with not having any more kids. I was OK with not getting married, but I was also still working through a lot of things and was scared of any relationship. I do love Matt more than anything I have so much respect and admiration, but when it comes to the kids, I’m appalled at his lack of disconnection. 

Am I in the wrong for wanting more than a commitment out of the relationship? 
Am I in the wrong for being so hard on his daughter? 
Am I in the wrong for making him accountable for his children? 
Am I in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship if he can’t stand up to the plate?

","# TL;DR:

I’ve been in love with my best friend since college but never confessed my feelings. She’s now happily married, and I’ve avoided her since her wedding to respect her relationship and protect my emotions. She’s visiting for the holidays and wants to meet, but I’m torn between seeing her or keeping my distance. Need advice on how to handle this.



Hey all, I have been a long-time lurker. I’ve never posted before, so this is my first post.

It's a long story and a small introduction about me.

I’m from a small remote area, and as an introvert, it’s always been hard for me to connect with people. Throughout my school days, I had only two friends. Later, due to their parents’ work, they had to move to another state.

My parents always worked late and had very little time for me as I was growing up. They never really understood how hard it was for me to connect with people. To avoid making them worry, I used to tell them, “I have a whole lot of friends that I’m going out with, so you don’t have to worry about me.” In reality, I would sneak back home after they left for work and spend the time gaming alone.

I studied well, and that effort got me an opportunity to move to another state. It was about a 14-hour drive from my home. After I joined university, I took a studio apartment to live in. The next day, classes started, and since I had chosen Computer Science as my major, we had a discussion on Android technology. The professor asked us to divide into groups for a debate.

This is where I met someone I never knew would become my best friend. Ironically, we were on opposing teams. After some time, as the debate progressed, we both started arguing passionately about the topic, and things got a little heated. Being an introvert my whole life, I had no idea how to stay sensible in such situations. To defend my point, I started raising my voice. She responded by shouting back, and soon, we were both screaming.

Some students were laughing, while others, especially those on our teams, looked terrified about what might happen. In a fit of rage, I yelled even louder.

She started tearing up, and then the professor intervened and calmly diffused the situation. I was embarrassed and frustrated, convinced I had made a terrible impression on everyone, especially her.

Watching her tear up, I suddenly felt so bad, so quickly. I don’t know what got into me.

I had never screamed at someone the way I did that day, especially over such a silly point I was trying to prove.

After the class, the guilt I felt (I can still feel it to this day) consumed me. The next day, I was determined to apologize to her for my behavior in front of the entire class. However, as I approached her, she simply left the room. That hit me hard, and I felt a pain I had never experienced before.

I took it to heart and decided to make amends no matter what. Every day, I would show up and try to apologize. For 15 continuous days, I apologized in different ways until, finally, she smiled. 

But to my surprise, after the class ended, she approached me with a smile and said, *""Hey, you were really passionate back there. Let's grab coffee and talk more ,civilly this time?""*

That moment was a turning point. We talked, debated more (in a friendly way), and realized we had so much in common beyond just our shared interest in technology. Over time, she became the friend I never thought I could have. She helped me break out of my shell, encouraged me to join clubs, and even dragged me to events where I met other amazing people.

For someone who spent most of their life alone, having a best friend like her made me realize the power of connection. Then, I started working on being more open and challenging the boundaries I once put up. It hasn’t been easy, but I learned to let people in and it all started with a heated debate in a university classroom.

During our semester holidays, we came to know that we were from neighboring cities, only a 45-50 minute drive from each other. We joined the same outlet as interns and did well. She was the best friend that ever happened to me. We used to share every little detail with each other, and both our parents got along so well. In the third semester, we even went on a vacation with our families together.

Everything was going well. In the final semester, we had a chat about the future. She casually said I would make a great husband. I was dumb—I never caught the sign. (You know how our stupid brains can be.) I never even realized I was falling for her. I didn’t know she had feelings for me either.

I never told her that I had also developed feelings for her, out of fear of losing her friendship. She was more valuable to me than anyone else in my life, and I just didn’t know how to open up about it to her.

After we finished our studies, I had two job offers as a consultant, and I had to choose which company to start with. She had one offer as a software engineer. But we both had to part ways to pursue our careers.

Even then, we maintained good communication. Whenever I knew she was going home, I would take leave to meet her and her family, as well as mine. Yet, my stupid brain never acted, and I never understood her true feelings.

Four years later, her father introduced her to her fiancé. She, her father, and her mother invited me to her engagement ceremony. There, I met another girl who had studied with us. She told me that my friend had feelings for me all along, but because I never acted on it, she thought I didn’t feel the same way. That news hit me super hard.

I didn’t know what to do. I just accepted my fate and attended her wedding with a heart full of love for her. Yes, I loved her ,I loved her with all my heart. But it was too late for me to express my feelings. That was two years ago, and it was the last time I saw her in person. She used to message me from time to time, but I would respond only once or twice.

She lives happily with her husband now. He’s a good man who takes care of her. I don’t want to do anything that would hurt her relationship with him. That’s the whole reason I started to avoid her after her marriage. Every time she texts me, a flood of emotions rushes through me.

Now, she’s come home for Thanksgiving and texted me, asking to meet. I haven’t replied. She’s staying until New Year’s, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to see her. I know I’m dumb, always too late for everything, but the minute I see her, I don’t know how I would react.

One side my heart tells me to meet her, but my brain judges it as a bad idea to even text her. I don’t know what to do. 

Please give me some advice.

I got a boat given to me a little over a year ago. I paid $17.75 to register it and transfer the title.

A couple caveats:This is for those than have a way to cook. Stove, camp fire, BBQ, etc. I know some people's situations keep them from doing this. Cooking really isn't as complicated as some make it seem.

Unfortunately if you don't have a way to cook you're gonna blow through you EBT pretty quick. It sucks, but that's the way it is. Find food banks, go to as many feeds a day as you can, get food stamps/EBT, panhandle, busk, ask people for food, fly a sign, etc. If the feeds suck go somewhere else. You're already homeless. You can go anywhere. People will generally hook you up if you hitchhike out of there with nothing.

Here's some tips for eating healthy while living on EBT/food stamps:

I live on a boat now, so I guess not 100% homeless. I don't have refrigeration at the moment. Also it's just me.

My go to lately is canned soup/chilli, tortillas, cheese, and having some munchies and sugary stuff. I mostly drink water, have for years. I do throw some other drinks in sparingly, because you have to have some flavor. Seems to make a pretty balanced meal. It's dirt cheap per meal. ~$3. If I made soup it would be less then half the cost.

I also buy some lunch meat, spam, and hot dogs. Definitely not the best health-wise but gives a decent bit of meat protein. If I'm craving red meat I'll grab some ground beef, bacon and an onion. Voila, bacon cheeseburgers with grilled onions. Condiments from the grocery store deli. (I buy ketchup and mustard. Mayo packets as needed.)

I'll toss in a Cuban from Publix here and there. Some cliff bars.

I have coffee, cream, and sugar every morning.

I own a small sauce pan/pot, a normal sized skillet (14""?), enough dishes for two people, and some cheap utensils. So cleaning isn't too bad.

I cook on a double burner camp stove. I only use one burner ever. I have a BBQ sized propane tank (20lb.?), but for cooking the green 1lb. tanks last me about 2 weeks. (~5 months for the big tanks)

I've been an executive chef a few times in different resorts. You can do fine dining from scratch cheaper than making cheap unhealthy food, if you have a way to cook and a place to store food. Maybe not lobster and Ribeyes, but I have seen it happen.

Living on ramen/rice and beans/quinoa/oatmeal etc. not only will ruin your health, but will waste your limited resources. (I like those things but you can't live off a starvation diet.)

Most fine dining came from necessity and having limited ingredients around to use. Almost all of which are dirt cheap. The recipes are simple.

Start with learning the 'mother' sauces. Make soups and stews. A favorite dish of mine is rice, some meat, and a can of veg. Toss some soy sauce and some hosin sauce in there.

You can almost throw any ingredients together and make good food. (I have definitely f'd that up a couple times, but it's rare.)

Keep your food out of direct sunlight. It will last longer.

Any recipe that has a ton of ingredients is somebody trying to stroke their own ego, or doesn't know what they're doing. Find a simpler recipe. I've packed nice restaurants on ~6 ingredient dishes. Basic cheap ingredients.

Back in the day we used to feed groups of 30 or more on what we found in dumpsters over a fire. Everybody ate until they were stuffed and we had a real good time.

I just completely restocked, my EBT reups on the 9th (6 days from now) and I've got $60 left on my card. I pretty much eat what I want, but I lean towards healthier stuff. This is completely doable.

On 12/5, around 810 am, I had a horrible tension headache. I knew I couldn't take ibuprofen, so I took Tylenol. My head was still hurting, so my dad brought me a flavored coffee drink to see if that would help, since caffeine does help me sometimes. I thought it didn't have much caffeine. i thought a little bit of caffeine would be better than having a headache, since I used to have energy drinks after Botox when I was like 12 because I didn't know any better, and the results were still good.

I looked up the drink now and it says it has 400 mg of caffeine. Will this cause my ~~Botox~~ Xeomin to diffuse a lot? One injection in my top lid has the small risk of migrating to the levator palpebrae superioris, effectively dropping the lid, which has never happened to me. This particular injection is intentionally isolated and injected in a way that minimizes the risk of migration to the LPS.

I know that diffusion is normal, and results can vary each time. I want to know how much 400 mg of caffeine accelerates the rate of diffusion and what kind of results I can expect. Unfortunately, my body is pretty used to caffeine, even though I don't really drink it anymore, so I did not feel my heart beating out of my chest or anything.

So far, I notice a big improvement in my upper and lower lid, and I am not worried. Still, do you think this warrants a call to my ophthalmologist? Thank you!",1,1733503902.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

He piles up 3 plates of food and grabs some coffee, I told him that this is his last time being allowed to do this. Next day, his mother comes over and tells me I harassed her son and that I can’t deny him food that’s free. 

I explained it’s free for guest that pay for it and that it’s not harassment to not allow them to just grab food. She starts to get loud in our lobby and I told her that if she keeps making a scene I’ll have to call the police. I get called a bitch and she storms off, then my GM tells me that I shouldn’t have interacted with them in the first place because they weren’t bothering anyone.

I was really scared to talk to girls as a teen, and that fear has gotten worse as an adult.

I'm not talking about flirting/sexual jokes etc, I'm nervous simply saying hello to an attractive women. It's almost like I see an attractive women, and brain automically says ""no"" without any hesitation or second thought.

I can talk to customer service staff as the conversation is incredibly structured, but that's about it. The last time I had a 1-on-1 conversation with an attractive women was last November.

I'm very social with other men, but completely freeze when a few attractive women are close by. It's often said that ""exposure therapy"" is the solution, but that hasn't been the case for me, nor do I think spending more time out the house will fix it.

It's gotten to the point that I no longer frequent my local coffee shop, as the women who work there made me incredibly nervous and anxious. I always had to sit in the toilets as I become overwhelmed. I hang my head in shame whenever I walk past, knowing that I want to, but can't force myself enough.

On top of this, I also put women on a pedestal due to my lack of confidence and extremely low self-esteem. In other words, I automatically assume that attractive women are better than me, simply because they're good looking.

People who say getting a haircut, shaving your facial hair, dressing nice and smelling good etc. will ""give"" you confidence are full of horseshit. Anyone can do this (I like to look presentable), but that doesn't mean shit when it comes to confidence.

I constantly hear from my friends that it's ""easy"", but they only find it easy as they don't have this problem.

It also shatters my self-esteem more, when I hear about the casual sex lives of my friends. However, I've never once been jealous of my friends in healthy relationships, as I'm genuinely happy for them.",7,1733503818.0,AskMenAdvice,35,0.89,False

No rage, just pure sadness.","I can still remember the feeling. It was like walking into a room where you thought someone was supposed to be, but instead, it was just emptiness staring back at you.

We were in the kitchen, like we’d done so many times before. He was stirring his coffee, his back to me, as I leaned against the counter, just watching him. It’s funny how something so simple, something so ordinary, could feel so off. It was the silence. The kind that started creeping in, little by little, until it was all there was. And we both knew it.

I remember that day so clearly. The night before, we argued again about nothing, really. Just the same things that we always argued about, but this time, it was different. We were both too tired, too hurt to even try to fix it. I had tried, you know? I always tried. But it felt like every time I reached for him, he pulls away just a little more. And I started to wonder if he even noticed anymore.

I watched him as he fidgeted his mug, avoiding my gaze, and for the first time in what felt like forever, I couldn’t remember why I loved him. That spark that used to keep me up at night, the laughter that would fill up every space between us, was gone. Replaced with quiet frustration and a growing distance that neither of us knew how to bridge.

It wasn’t that he didn’t try, not really. It’s just that we stopped seeing each other the way we used to. The things I used to admire about him, his drive, his sense of humor, the way he cared about everything... just felt distant, like I was looking at a stranger instead of the person I once thought I knew better than anyone.

He looked at me then, and for a split second, I saw the same sadness in his eyes that I had in mine. And in that moment, it hit me, we were both trapped in something we didn’t know how to get out of. We weren’t the people we were when we first met, and I wasn’t sure if we ever could be again.

“I think we should break up,” I said, my voice sounding foreign, like it didn’t belong to me. The words just slipped out, like they’d been waiting to escape for months. He didn’t say anything at first, just stared at me like he couldn’t quite believe it. And I couldn’t blame him. I didn’t want to believe it either.

But we were broken, both of us. And I realized that, as much as it hurt, as much as it tore me apart to even think about saying goodbye, it was the only way to save what was left of us. Because love isn’t supposed to be this heavy. It shouldn’t feel like a chore. And somewhere along the way, it stopped feeling like love.

I walked out of that kitchen, my heart pounding in my chest, because I knew, deep down, that this was the end. It didn’t matter how much I wished things were different. It didn’t matter how much I tried to ignore the cracks that had been spreading between us for months. We were done. And that was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to accept.",3,1733503538.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

**Incline Village** *""Where millionaires live like billionaires and billionaires complain about it.""* It’s the only place where the HOA fines are higher than your mortgage.

**Kings Beach** *""Where the beach days are glorious and the parking tickets are plentiful.""* Kings Beach is the land of “fun for the whole family”—as long as the kids don’t mind a two-hour wait for pizza and Dad doesn’t cry over the parking ticket he just got.

Imagine this: it’s the summer of 2054. We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here’s what makes my story unique:**  
🎵 **Music as a Muse:** A future vinyl collector searching for a space, a lover of playlists that take you on a journey, and songs that feel like a warm hug. Music has a unique way of connecting moments, and I love finding the perfect soundtrack for every memory. Got a favorite song? Share it—I’m always ready to discover melodies that move you.  
🌍 **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
📚 **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.  
🕹️ **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m searching for someone who’s as curious about the world as I am—a woman who is kind at heart, sharp of mind, and carries a quiet strength that makes you want to know every story behind her smile. Someone who’s not just eager to explore the world around us but also willing to dive into the uncharted territory of creating a world together.

A partner in curiosity, someone who loves sharing dreams and building them into something real. Whether it’s small projects, grand adventures, or simply learning to navigate life’s challenges side by side, I want to create something unique with you—a shared journey filled with meaning, discovery, and connection.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we’ll let it—after all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let’s start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of “what if.” Let’s see where the words take us.",2,1733503399.0,r4r,1,0.63,False

My recollections were interrupted by the ringing of the front door bell. I quickly removed my apron, straightened my stockings, and scurried to the foyer. 

Standing before me was a striking young woman. Mason‘s first wife was of Indian descent whereas Mason‘s ethnic background is Eastern European. Piper Draper had exotic looks but was exceedingly attractive: long, silky straight, black hair; slightly dark complexion, with seemingly flawless skin; slender and relatively tall; large (but not excessively so) breasts. She regarded me with a confident smile .

I curtsied and said, “You must be Miss Piper. Welcome to the home of my mistress. May I take your coat?” The fact that she was Mason’s daughter alone filled me with great trepidation. Her beauty did not help. 

“And you must be the famous Henry Hathaway. Or infamous, I should say. Boy, did I hear a lot you when I was growing up. None of it good,” she said as I removed her coat. Beneath it, she was stylishly dressed in a maroon skirt, a tight black blouse and black fashion tights with ankle boots. 

“I am deeply sorry Miss Piper.” 

“I imagine you are. It’s so awesome that my dad now has a slave. Look at your uniform! I’ve never met a real live sissy maid before. You’re part of a pretty large subculture. Did you know that?”

“I …uh…I’m aware that there are others who dress this way.” 

“Quite a large number do actually, from time to time at least. But I suspect there are very few who dress this way 24/7 and actually live the life of a real maid. You’re special. I’m really interested to hear about all of your duties. Domestic and otherwise. I also can’t wait to meet Dad’s girlfriend. That would be who you referred to as your mistress, I guess. But she’s still your wife, right?”

“Technically, legally, yes she is, miss.”

“And I think my Dad said that your son is going to be here for Thanksgiving, too? Is that right?”

“Yes, miss. Please allow me to take you to the living room where your father, Mistress Natalie and Master Ryan are visiting with the other guests.”

“Master Ryan is your son?”

“Yes, miss.”

“And what does he think of his father being a cuckolded sissy maid?”

“Truthfully, miss, I am not sure. He was not aware of my…my…reduced status until just yesterday.”

“Fascinating. I want to spend time talking to all of you and getting to know you. Your wife and your son, too. Maybe others in your social circle as well. It’s never too early to start thinking about my honor’s thesis, even though it’s not due until my senior year. I’m getting some pretty serious inspiration in this house, and I haven’t even gotten past the entrance hall. Take me to see your mistress and my Dad.”

I couldn’t have been more relieved to bring this disturbing conversation to an end. The thought of being the subject of some precocious undergrad’s thesis on the subject of sexual deviancy – the daughter of the deviant man who had enslaved me, no less – was really more I than could bear. 

Once I had escorted Piper to the living room, it was time to refresh everyone’s drinks. Despite the fact that Daphne, Ryan and Piper were all technically under age, their parents raised no objection when they told me to bring them a bottle of champagne. Ryan demanded that I get Lorena from the kitchen (where she had been helping me baste the turkey and cook the carrots and risotto ) to join them for a toast. I suspect his motivation was two-fold: to demonstrate clearly that I, and not Lorena, was the true servant despite the fact that she was assisting me; and to demonstrate his authority over me to his two female admirers, who were sitting on either side of him on a couch in the corner of the room. He certainly did sound  authoritative in issuing his command. Neither Daphne nor Piper could suppress their giggles when I responded with “Yes, sir. Right away, sir,” and a curtsy. Clearly everyone was acutely conscious of Ryan’s and my relationship with one another, causing my humiliation to be off the charts. 

When Lorena joined them on the couch, Ryan was surrounded by three very attractive young women and was obviously greatly enjoying all of the attention. While his cousin was clearly not an option, I wondered whether he would gravitate more to the sexy, flirtatious Latina, four years his senior, or to the more exotic, intellectual Piper. I could add envy to the complex swirl of negative emotions surrounding my son. 

When the turkey was out of the oven and resting, I lit the candles and then respectfully asked everyone to move to the dining room. First, I stood directly in front of Mason, curtsied to him and then ostentatiously pulled out the chair at the head of the table – the chair I had occupied at every previous Thanksgiving we had hosted at the mansion – for him to be seated. After he sat down, I pushed in his chair and gave him another deep curtsy, an unequivocal display of subservience to the man who had so completely defeated, displaced and unmanned me. I then seated Natalie and Ryan at either side of him, followed by curtsies to each of them. My curtsy to Ryan was met with still more giggles from his young admirers. 

After that, the rest of the guests took their seats as I started to pour glasses of wine. When Scott Isles sat down next to his wife, I realized with alarm that I had forgotten to alter the placards of the two Scott’s (I had intended to put the first initial of their last names after “Scott”), so they were both starting to sit down precisely opposite of where Natalie intended. In my haste to intervene and prevent them from sitting in the wrong seats, I knocked over a glass of Boudreaux onto Miranda, much of it landing on her light orange skirt. Meanwhile, both Scotts sat down in the wrong places. 

Miranda: “You clumsy oaf. I just bought this skirt!”

Natalie: “I can’t believe you, Henrietta. You can’t follow the most simple instructions. I’m so sorry, Miranda. I’ll replace your lovely skirt or we can tack on some extra cleaning sessions of your house after the maid pays off your car insurance hike.”

Mason: “This is totally unacceptable.”

Natalie: “Scott and Scott, this is terribly embarrassing, but would the two of you mind switching seats?”

Scott Isles: “No problem, Natalie.”

Scott, my brother-in-law: “It’s fine, but what a total fuckup he is.”

Piper: “Shit, some wine splattered onto my blouse as well. It’s probably ruined.”

Ryan: “Airhead.”

Daphne: “I’m not surprised.” 

Mason: “Totally unacceptable. We will deal with this after dinner in the game room. Since everyone here has been inconvenienced by this gross incompetence, everyone will see firsthand how we deal with such nonsense in this house.” 

Piper: “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”

Aimee: “Me neither.”

I felt dizzy, nauseous. I had tried so hard to avoid precisely this kind of situation, yet here I was. My attempt at humiliation mitigation had failed miserably. 

The rest of the dinner was relatively uneventful. I even got a few compliments – mostly for the mushroom soup and the gravy. The turkey was moist, but the risotto was a bit underdone. Overall, however, the meal was deemed a success. Of the three desserts prepared by Lorena, the Boston cream pie was the biggest hit. Ironically, I didn’t even get a small slice (though I did lick the cream off the cake knife before putting it into the dishwasher).

Mason, Natalie and the four older guests planned to play pool and/or simply talk with amongst themselves in the game room after dinner whereas Ryan, Daphne, Piper and Lorena planned to watch a movie together in the home theater. But before those diversions took place, everyone gathered in the game room for the far more entertaining spectacle of watching the master of the house correct the careless, hopelessly incompetent maid. I had to wonder, even had I not screwed up with the placards or spilled the wine, whether I wouldn’t have still found myself in the exact same predicament. If it wasn’t those things, it probably would have been some other pretext (the undercooked risotto, for instance). For what was really happening was not me being punished for my carelessness on Thanksgiving, but rather me being punished for who I had been prior to March: the supremely conceited, selfish, arrogant, entitled, abusive prick that was Henry Hathaway. That, and a semi-public demonstration by Mason of just how throughly he has broken me.

When all of the guests and family members gathered in the game room, I got everyone a fresh drink or cup of coffee and tea – it was important, after all, that the audience members be optimally comfortable for the coming show – before Mason said to me, “Maid, fetch my new Smoked Dragon Stinger cane. No time like the present to try it out.”

“Yes, sir,” I replied with a curtsy. I quickly retrieved the cane and presented it to Mason in the required manner: on bended knee, arms extended, and both palms upturned with the cane lying flat across them. As I knelt there waiting for him to take it, I quickly scanned the room to look at the mostly amused expressions of anticipation. Ryan was the exception; he regarded me with a contemptuous sneer.

The Smoked Dragon Stinger was a recent addition to Mason’s growing collection of punishment implements. It was purchased from the same high-end, British purveyor of rattan canes where Mason had procured several others that I was all too familiar with. The rattan of the Smoked Dragon had a dark finish and was quite attractive as instruments of torture go. Given my experience with the other products sold by this establishment, I had little doubt that the pain I was about to experience would be excruciating. 

Picking up the cane from my hands, Mason announced my sentence: “The maid will receive 12 strokes. Three for the offense to his mistress in not properly arranging the placards as she directed, and the resulting embarrassment to her and to me. Three for spilling wine on and ruining the skirt of Miranda. Three for spilling wine on and ruining the blouse of Piper. And finally three for disrupting and tarnishing what has otherwise been a very enjoyable evening.” Mason was so full of shit; my impending chastisement would be the most enjoyable part of the entire day for him, as well as for likely everyone else present, with the obvious exception of yours truly. I had endured 12 strokes before – even more on a few occasions – so I knew what I was in store for. It was going to be hell.

I actually considered begging him – groveling to him in the most abject of possible ways (clasping his ankles, smothering his shoes with kisses, verbally pleading) in front of all present – but decided against it. I decided that I simply would not give him that satisfaction. He probably would have rejected my entreaties anyway. Rather, I resolved to endure my humiliating punishment in as stoic a manner as I was capable, trying to salvage at least a shred of dignity, no matter how compromised.

“Stand against the pool table and bend over,” Mason commanded.

“Straighten your stocking seams first!” Natalie said sharply. 

After I adjusted my seams and got into the required position, Mason lifted up the my skirt of my dress with the cane and then pulled down my panties, exposing my bare ass to everyone in the room. The welts from my last caning, almost 2 weeks earlier, had indeed almost completely faded, so Mason was working with the blank canvas that Natalie had desired.

Well, nearly blank. “What the hell is that black thing around his balls?” asked Aimee Isles. From my position bending over, my scrotum was visible to everyone, of course. I could not see any of them from my vantage point, of course, but I recognized all of their voices.

“That’s the base of his chastity cage,” explained my wife. 

“His what?” Ryan asked. This was mortifying beyond comprehension.

“His chastity cage, honey. Your father’s cock is locked up. He can urinate with the cage on, of course. But he can’t do…other things. Mason and I are his key holders. When he wishes to be released, he has to petition us.”

“You mean he needs to petition you to beat off?” Ryan asked in disbelief.

Daphne giggled. “I was starting to tell you about this, but we got interrupted.” 

Natalie: “That’s a bit crudely put, honey. But, basically, yes.”

Piper said, “I’ve never seen one of these on someone before. Can you make him turn around so I can get a better look?”

“When his punishment is over and he is in penance, you will be able to see it quite clearly, dear. It’s actually a quite impressive piece of hardware,” said Natalie.

“Great. I can’t wait,” replied Piper.

Meanwhile, Ryan walked around to the other side of the pool table and looked at me directly in the eye before saying, “Just when I think you can’t get any more pathetic, you do. You sink even lower. You deserve every bit of punishment that you get, and more.”

“Dad, I have a request,“ said Piper to Mason.

“Yes, sweetheart?”

“I’d like my three of the maid’s cane stokes to be delivered by Ryan, if you don’t mind?” said Piper.

“That’s a great idea!” said my niece, far too enthusiastically

“I don’t mind. The question is whether Ryan minds. But why, may I ask?” said Mason. 

“I’m really fascinated by the family dynamics. My interest is purely clinical, of course,” said Piper.

“Mine isn’t,” said Daphne. 

“You go, girl!” said Miranda to her daughter.

“Miranda!” said her husband.

“What’s the problem? The girl knows what she wants. I applaud it,” Miranda replied.

“I do, too,” said Natalie. “But what say you, Ryan?”

Ryan had walked back behind me, with the others “It would be my pleasure,” he said coldly.

Surely, this was some kind of nightmare. This could not be real. Surely, I would wake up any second now in the comfort of my king bed, Natalie next to me, under the covers.

“Very well, then. I will deliver the first six stokes. Ryan will deliver the three after that, and I will finish up. The maid will then stand in penance for an hour while the rest of us get on with our evening,” said Mason.

I groaned, involuntarily. The shame was too much. Could I follow Natalie‘s advice? My cock was pressing up violently against the rings of the DOMINIX. I felt the cool air on my bare ass. My nipples were still raw from Mason’s punishment earlier in the week. I was conscious of the sensual feeling of the Agent Provocateur stockings touching my legs and the corset constricting my waist. I was hyper conscious of all the people about to witness my chastisement. Not only their number, but who they were, their individual relationships to me and how those relationships had metamorphosed over the prior six months. I was at the apex of arousal and shame (at least up to this stage of my life). Perversely, it occurred to me at that moment that, had I been liberated from chastity, my arousal was such that I probably would never stop ejaculating, that my jism would fill the room and flood the halls. Especially since it had been so, so long… Was this what Natalie was talking about?

And just as I thought, to myself that it was physically impossible to feel any greater frustrated arousal, Mason, my master, began to swish and swoosh the Smoked Dragon in the air. Oh, that sound! At once, dreaded and delicious. Not another sound in the room to complete with it. 

Then the feeling of the cane resting against my ass. Mason likes to make me wait. He was forcing his audience to wait, too, building the tension, building their anticipation. I knew from experience that when the first stroke came, it would come savagely and without warning. Sometimes he would make me wait 30 seconds, sometimes a minute. On this particular occasion, it was slightly over a minute, if anything. I could not see, but could feel the 18 eyes boring into my ass. 

And then it came. Dear god!

 The Smoked Dragon did not disappoint. Or did disappoint, depending upon one’s perspective, I guess. It breathed fire. Mason’s strokes covered both cheeks of my poor bottom. To pick up on Natalie’s metaphor, he was a master artist with a painterly style, using cane strokes rather than brush strokes to achieve the texture he was striving for on his canvas: fresh welts on my abused flesh.

By the third stroke, I raised my leg and high heel into the air before putting in back down on the floor. Tears started to form in my eyes by the fourth stroke. 

By the fifth stroke, I was beginning to reconsider my stoic approach. Maybe I should give Mason the satisfaction of begging after all, even if didn’t persuade him to relent. Wouldn’t that truly be surrendering to my shame?

After the sixth stroke, I heard Mason say  “Here, Ryan. It’s your turn.” I groaned again loudly, not out of pain but out of profound humiliation. 

And then I heard the swishing sound again, my son imitating Mason, I assumed. Then Ryan did something different, and unexpected. He placed the cane against my ass, and rather than make me wait, he tapped it three times, using only moderate force, before bringing if down savagely. I kicked my stocking-clad foot into the air again. 

Mason said, “You’ve done this before.”

Ryan replied, “Countless times. I was a prefect at school.”

“I thought they had banned corporal punishment in UK boarding schools,” said Natalie.

“It was banned when I got there, but the new conservative government that came into power two years ago lifted the ban. After that, the cane and strap were used widely in the dorms. I developed something of a reputation for being one of the more no nonsense prefects.”

“We can tell,” said Lorena.

“It’s good to hear that physical punishment has made a comeback on both sides of the pond, now that the pansy progressives are no longer in power. I hope the new administration follows through on their promise to institute judicial caning here. There’s a reason you don’t see so much as a single gum wrapper on the streets of Singapore,” said Mason, the authoritarian bastard.

Ryan swished the cane again, very close to my right ear. At Ryan’s second stoke, tears began streaming down my cheeks. “Please, sir,” I whispered.

“Did you mean to address me?” Ryan asked sharply. 

“No, sir,” I lied.

“Good. I didn’t think so,” he said, delivering the last of his three strokes, this one the most wicked of the bunch. 

“Well done, young man,” Mason said.

“Thanks, Ryan. That was very, very interesting to observe,” said Piper. 

“I can think of another word,” said Daphne.

“Me, too,” said Lorena.

Not to be shown up, Mason said, “It’s not over yet,” and after some more swishing, gave me an absolutely searing stroke. The pain was so intense that I dropped briefly to my knees. I knew remaining there for long would only earn me more punishment at a later date, so I stood back up and resumed my position. 

After the eleventh stroke, I involuntarily reached back with my right hand to shield my bottom. I knew this was forbidden, but it was a reflexive act; I had to stop the assault somehow. 

“If you don’t remove your hand, I’ll cane your palm,” Mason announced. That did the trick. After Mason delivered the final viscous cut, Natalie said, “Lorena, dear, would you mind dabbing up those few driblet’s of blood on Henrietta’s bottom with a cocktail napkin. We don’t want any of it to get on the floor.“

Although she was quite gentle, I winced while Lorena applied the napkin to my quivering ass cheeks and upper thighs. I was then given a couple of moments to collect myself. I wiped the tears from eyes with my hand, stood up, pulled up my panties, pulled down the skirt of my uniform and checked to ensure that my seams were straight. I wished I had a tissue to blow my nose.

I then turned to Mason to complete an important part of the post punishment ritual. I curtsied deeply to him, as all of the guests watched intently, and said, “Thank you, Master Mason, for correcting me. Now, may I refresh anyone’s drink?” 

Then, my son said forcefully, “Aren’t you forgetting something?”

“Yes, sir. Of course, sir, my sincere apologies.” Still unsteady in my heels, I pivoted to fully face him, dipped into a deep curtsy, and said, “Thank you, Master Ryan, for correcting me.” 

I then quickly scanned the room. All of the women present, without exception, had satisfied smiles on their faces. Natalie, in particular, was beaming. I then looked up at my son. The corners of his mouth were slightly upturned, the beginnings of a smug smile. We made eye contact. I could almost see the wheels turning in his head. I could see the realization solidifying there of the extraordinary power he now held over me, his own father, and how very useful that power could prove to him in any number of respects. And although not a word was spoken at this moment, I felt he knew that I knew that that was what he was thinking. There was a tacit understanding between us. 

What he did not know (presumably, at least) was that my traitorous cock was once again hardening in its cage. This was highly unusual, perhaps unprecedented even, in the aftermath of such a brutal punishment. Typically, when Mason canes me, I become aroused in anticipation of the punishment. Sometimes, my cock even stays hard (or at least as hard as possible in its prison) for the first one or two strokes of the cane or strap or belt. But usually the pain soon becomes so great that my arousal quickly fades, then disappears altogether, as my mind focuses solely on the pain. I usually then remain flaccid for quite a bit of time following my punishment, even in my humiliating penance position, until the pain eventually at least begins to subside. 

Not that Thanksgiving day. Whether it was because of the humiliation of being punished in front of so many people – the most ever up to that point in time – or whether it was because of the indescribable humiliation of being caned by my own son, publicly no less, my arousal returned with distressing urgency even as my ass and upper thighs burned like fire. Was this what Natalie bent by surrendering to the humiliation? Perhaps.

After I refreshed everyone’s drinks, Natalie commanded me to assume my penance position. 

“Maid, remove your uniform, so our guests can admire Mason’s – and Ryan’s – handiwork. Then stand in the corner with your hand’s clasped behind your head.”

I did as she commanded, standing in the corner in my heels, stockings and garters, panties and corset. Natalie pulled down my panties. “Now, isn’t that lovely?” she asked rhetorically. “Such a deep red color. There’s almost nothing else like it in nature. And such well defined stripes and texture.”

“Maybe you could commission some famous artist to paint your maid‘s bottom after punishment, so you could add the piece to your incredible art collection, Natalie,” suggested Aimee. 

“That’s really not a bad idea, Aimee,” Natalie replied. 

“But when do we get to see his chastity cage? I can’t see it with him facing the wall,” said Piper.

“Patience, dear. After 30 minutes in this position, the maid will turn around to face us for another 30 minutes to complete his penance. You can then examine his cage to your heart’s content.”

Having been up since 5 AM and working throughout the day, I was exhausted in addition to being in tremendous pain. Even during the first half of my post punishment penance, my legs and arms began to tremble somewhat with strain and fatigue. 

The trembling only got worse after I turned around and faced the guests, my arms still elevated behind my head. Most of the guests were now talking boisterously to each other and laughing, paying me little attention, except to occasionally look over at me and smile or chuckle. Piper was the exception. She walked over to me and crouched down in front of my caged cock to examine the DOMINIX. She even touched the metal rings and fingered the padlock, at one point snapping the rings with her fingernail a couple of times. When she did so, I felt her nail make contact with my flesh, which was pushing up against and trying to escape the rings that encircled it.

I tried to stare directly ahead, expressionless. But I had to meet her eye when she addressed me. She spoke quietly, but intently: “You must be incredibly uncomfortable right now. I can’t imagine what you must be feeling. How it must feel to be whipped in front of all these people that you know by the man who took your wife and by your own son. Does the humiliation arouse you? It certainly appears to.
I know you can’t speak now. But I’m definitely looking forward to getting to know you better. You and Natalie and Ryan. It’s going to be a trip.”

After the second 30 minute part of my penance was up, I put my uniform back on and continued to serve the older guests as they played pool and talked, and brought the younger guests drinks and popcorn while they watched a film. It was nearly 11 PM before all of the guests – with the exception of Piper, who was staying in a guest room upstairs – left the mansion. 

I cleaned for two hours after everyone left, before I finally lay down on my cot, exhausted, aroused, frustrated and stunned. As I said before, that Thanksgiving will haunt me for years to come.",2,1733503299.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

It was like, okay, you’ve been unleashed."" (TrekMovie)","TREKMOVIE:

""When Deep Space Nine‘s Nana Visitor was approached about writing Star Trek: Open A Channel: A Woman’s Trek about the women in Star Trek, the original idea pitched to her was that she’d do short interviews to work into a picture-filled coffee table book. When she started doing interviews, the concept changed to something deeper: a look at female Trek characters, yes, but also a deep dive into the actresses who played them and they times they lived in. We reviewed the book when it came out, then spoke to her in depth about her experience writing it and how it affected her.

Here is the final section of that extended and frank conversation, where she talks about the current batch of Star Trek shows and the progress that’s been made over the decades.

**LAURIE ULSTER (TREKMOVIE): In terms of the newer shows, let’s start with Picard. How much of Picard did you watch?**

>NANA VISITOR: I watched a little bit of the third season. I watched quite a bit of the others. Now there are some women in there that I would have loved to have talked to as well—and that may be why Michelle got cut out, that I didn’t have a Picard section, but I couldn’t reach them either. Also, don’t forget, it was during Covid.

**I thought that your thoughts on Raffi’s character were pretty spot-on. You didn’t get any pushback from anybody on that?**

>CBS read every word I wrote and didn’t make me change anything, which I was really impressed with.

**And even Picard season 3, I loved it, but it still took some steps back. There are episodes where no two women have a conversation. I also felt like Beverly Crusher shows up with her son, and then everybody immediately forgets how important a mother is.**

>Yes. I hear you on that, but I was just so thrilled to see Gates kick some ass and do what she’s capable of, just like Denise in Next Gen, when she came back to guest. It was like, okay, you’ve been unleashed.

**LAURIE ULSTER: Right! Here’s the character that was always there but never got to be there.**

>It was fantastic.

**And then Strange New Worlds is, I think, the only Star Trek show with more than three women in the main cast.**

>And they all look different, and they all have agency, and uniqueness. I think I said, I don’t know if it got in there, that they’re like a bunch of wildflowers. And in the ‘90s, we all had to be cultivated flowers: If you were lucky, you were a rose, but they’re like these gorgeous, unique flowers all unto themselves, which is so great.

1h85i9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1h85i9v/confusion_over_refills_have_starbucks_policies/,Confusion Over Refills: Have Starbucks Policies Changed?,"I’ve been a loyal Starbucks customer for years and always enjoyed the refill policy as a nice perk. I usually get a seasonal handcrafted drink (like an Iced Pumpkin Spice Latte) and then grab a refill of something plain, like an iced coffee or Earl Grey. But recently, I went to get my usual refill, and the baristas at my local store seemed confused about the policy.

Apparently, the district manager told them that:
	1.	You have to buy a hot or cold tea/coffee to get the same drink as a refill.
	2.	If you buy a more expensive, handcrafted drink, you’re no longer eligible for free refills of plain tea or coffee.

This totally threw me off because I’ve always understood the policy to be: as long as you stay in-store and use your Starbucks Rewards card, you can get a free refill of plain brewed coffee or tea, no matter what drink you started with.

It’s frustrating because I feel like the rules have either changed quietly, or baristas aren’t trained consistently. Does anyone else feel like Starbucks is cracking down on perks? And if you’re a barista or manager, has there been a change to the refill policy recently?

After tea, Ryan unpacked his suitcases and then Natalie and Mason took him for a walk around the expansive grounds of the mansion, including the stables and tennis courts. Meanwhile, I went back to work. Although, I had been cleaning the mansion regularly throughout the week (as I did every week), Mason instructed me to again thoroughly clean the bathrooms and to sweep and and mop all of the floors where our Thanksgiving guests would be spending time - the dining room, sitting room, main living room, game room and home theater. Mason was fond of saying, “The floors can’t be too clean; you should be able to eat off them. And if I ever find any dirt on them, you will be.” His and Natalie’s habit of walking around inside with the shoes and boots they wore outside made this a constant challenge.

Growing up, Ryan had always been more interested in baseball and soccer than what the mansion offered him for the taking - grass and hard surface tennis courts and stables where he could have kept at least one horse and more if he wished, as well as ample space to ride. I took it almost personally that he didn’t pursue what I thought of as the more “aristocratic” sports that my wealth enabled; I thought of it as a subtle “fuck you” to me that he was unimpressed by the trappings of wealth that I was so proud of, and would rather throw a baseball around with my brother-in-law than own and ride a horse. It’s almost as if he was saying to me, “See, I’m not a snob like you.” As it turns out, he had taken up both tennis and polo during his four years of school in UK. Apparently, his rich classmates exhibiting the trappings of wealth and snobbery was less objectionable than his father doing so. 

I learned of this change the very afternoon Ryan arrived, as I dusted the game room while Mason and Ryan played pool and Natalie enjoyed the gin martini I had just served her.

“I’m so happy that you’ve taken up polo, honey. Mason likes to play.”

“I’m not very good at it, but it’s fun,” said Mason, with the false humility he sometimes displays (though never to me, of course).

“I just started playing about a year ago, so I’m not great either. But I’d love to get better,” said Ryan.

“Great, we can practice together,” said Mason. “I’m a member of the Greenwich Polo Club. The facilities there are excellent. We’ll get you signed up for membership on Friday.”

“I think we should get you a horse, Ryan. Cleo could use a friend.” 

Cleo was Natalie’s mare, currently the sole occupant of the stables. While I enjoyed the idea of owning horses, I had neither the time nor inclination to actually to follow through with it when I was working. Natalie, on the other hand, had gone through a brief “horse girl” phase in her early teens. She didn’t ride often but, on those occasions when she did, I had always enjoyed admiring her long legs in her skin-tight jodhpurs and riding boots. I would be lying if I didn’t admit that seeing her attired that way stirred submissive fantasies in me even before my enslavement. But far more so since March, now that my submission is no longer fantasy but my round-the-clock reality. 

Nowadays, l fantasize in a different way: sometimes I think to myself that things wouldn’t be so bad if it was just Natalie and I in a dominant/submissive relationship. We could have fun and games in the bedroom, me submitting to my cruel riding mistress, and then afterwards resume our normal lives (i.e., me getting my way, lording it over everyone around me, including Natalie everywhere outside of our bedroom games). But obviously this is nothing more than a fantasy thanks to Mason being so prominently in the picture. When I used to read forced feminization stories in the privacy of my office, they were usually not cuckold stories. They were generally devoid of dominant males participating in the domination of the submissive, feminized protagonists. No, the submissive “heros” of the stories I favored were not emasculated and controlled by their wives’ lovers, only by their wives themselves, or by their girlfriends or other women. And certainly not by their own sons! My new reality was orders of magnitude more bizarre and degrading than any of the fantasy stories to which I used to masturbate. And, ironically, though I am helplessly, deeply, shamefully aroused by my staggeringly humiliating new reality, I am mostly forbidden from masturbating at all. Frustration, agony and confusion are what I am left with – and, as I explained before, ever growing desperation.

“The three of us can ride together,” Natalie continued. “It’ll be so much fun! I know an excellent horse breeder in Norwalk. We can go there on Saturday. How does that sound, honey?

“It sounds great, Mom. Except I’m not sure I want to spend all the time necessary to properly care of for a horse. They’re a lot of work.”

“But all you have to do is ride your horse, honey. We already have a stable boy. Or, perhaps I should say we already have a middle-aged stable maid. Haha. You father here already spends about an hour a day feeding and grooming Cleo and cleaning her stall. Another horse wouldn’t take him much longer.”

“Hey, I don’t want to be left out! Since I’m practically living here now, I’ll move Dante here,” said Mason. 

“Dante is Masons’s new Thoroughbred. He’s a beautiful boy,” explained Natalie to Ryan. Then to Mason: “That’s a wonderful idea, Mason darling. Taking care of three horses shouldn’t add more than another hour or so to Henrietta’s time each day in the stables. Well, perhaps more on Sundays when he gives the stalls a thorough cleaning, I suppose. But that’s really not our problem, is it?” Natalie asked rhetorically, looking over at me with a smirk, as I dusted the top shelf of a book case near the pool table. You may assume that Mason and Natalie would have deemed it too clichéd to have me clean the mansion with a feather duster; if so, you assume incorrectly. I am at once a very real maid and a parody of one.

Natalie continued addressing her lover, “In fact, darling, as we’ve discussed before, I think it’s really high time you sell your place and move in here fully. You’re practically here all the time now, so why not make it official?”

“It probably does make sense. The upkeep on two places is an unnecessary expense,” Mason agreed. Damn him.

This discussion shouldn’t have depressed me as much as it did. As Natalie said, Mason was around all the time already. Still, the “official” part of Natalie’s remark is what stung. My veritable enslavement by my wife’s lover would become official when he gave up his own place, and fully moved in here. Well, at least I wouldn’t have to clean his large home too, I reasoned, in a futile attempt to console myself. Once he moves in, how much longer would it be before Natalie divorces me and marries Mason? That would really make things official. I wouldn’t even be the husband in name any more. Simply the indentured servant. Domestic and sexual. Chattel.

“Well, it’s settled then,” Natalie said to Mason. Then to Ryan: “On Saturday, we’ll visit my breeder friend and see about getting you a fine polo horse.”

“I’ll also need some proper riding gear. I borrowed my friend’s at school.” 

Natalie said, “That’s no problem. It gives me ideas for some good Christmas presents for you. There’s an outstanding equestrian store about a 45 minute drive from here. We’ll take you there and get you everything you need. Mason’s been meaning to go shopping there for some new riding crops, haven’t you darling?”

“Yes. We can go early next week.”

“Mason uses a crop not only when riding Dante, but also to maintain discipline with the help,” said Natalie, looking in my direction with a smile. “And I’m not referring to Lorena, obviously. Lorena has become almost like a member of the family and is instrumental in helping to supervise your father, especially when Mason and I are out.”

“Riding crops can serve multiple purposes,” laughed Mason. 

“So true. We’ll buy you a couple of nice crops and dressage whips at the saddlery, honey. We’ll make sure you have at least one to keep in the stables and one to keep in your room. You never know when it might come in handy,” Natalie said to Ryan, with a titter. I looked from her to Ryan (trying to conceal my disbelief). He caught me looking at him, and I thought I detected the hint a gleam in his eye and the slight upturn of his lip as if he was involuntarily beginning to grin.

Splendid. While cleaning over the prior 15 minutes, I learned that I would have not one, but three horses to feed, groom and clean up after (I didn’t even particularly like animals). I learned that Mason would likely soon be selling his home to live in my former mansion permanently. And I heard the unmistakable (if unthinkable) suggestion that my son would be empowered to use a riding crop to discipline his own father. Ryan had barely been home for three hours, and already my level of humiliation and subjugation was increasing exponentially, it seemed. 

Normally, I would have been dusting, scrubbing and sweeping in one of my blue working maid uniforms – resembling that of a hotel maid, worn with nude or sometimes white tights – but Natalie wanted me to remain in my very short, formal uniform given the special occasion of Ryan’s return home. The problem is that whenever I bend over to clean something on or near the floor in that uniform, my short skirt rides up, exposing my panties and stockings. 

I guess I should not have been surprised when Natalie pointed to the bottom of the book shelf, and said, “Henrietta, you’re missing a lot of dust on the bottom shelf. I can see it from here. It should never have been allowed to get that dusty to begin with. Clean it now, properly!”

“Yes, ma’am,” I said, realizing that whether I bent over from a standing position or got on my knees to dust, it would make little difference; either way, my panty-clad bottom would be exposed to Natalie, Mason, and most horrifyingly, to my son. Trying to cover it with one of my hands would only call attention to it, probably not work anyhow and may very result in a smack to my bottom right then and there by Mason or Natalie. So I bent over and reached down with the duster, resigned to my humiliating exposure.

As I dusted the shelf, I was fairly certain that I heard Ryan mutter “disgusting“ under his breath.

After I finished cleaning, I began prepping some of the dishes for tomorrow’s feast. I had already put the turkey in a wet brine early that morning, bur there were still plenty of other things that could be done in advance to lighten my food preparation work for tomorrow. Lorena assisted me some, as it was decided that while I was principally responsible for cooking the dishes, she would have to do some of the work – such as basting the turkey, taking the stuffing and brussels sprouts out of the oven, garnishing the potatoes, etc. – so that I would be available to serve all of the dishes, as well as serve any pre-dinner snacks, drinks or anything else our guests desired. Lorena would only be called on to serve alongside me if things got too busy for me to handle alone. She would not be wearing a maid’s uniform tomorrow (simply an apron over her dress) and would be eating at the large dining room table along with the others. I, on the other hand, would have to look forward to quickly ingesting some leftovers while putting them away and cleaning up. 

Wednesday evening, after serving a light dinner to Mason, Natalie, Ryan and Lorena, I was summoned to the sitting room where the four of them were relaxing and talking.

When I entered the room and curtsied, Natalie said, “Henrietta, go get your shoe shine kit.” When I returned a moment later with the kit, she said, “Ryan brought two pairs of dress shoes with him in his luggage, and they both need a shine. I think he wants to wear the ones he has on now for dinner tomorrow. Isn’t that right, honey?”

“That’s right. I’ll take them off.”

“There’s no need to do that. Your father usually shines Mason’s and my shoes while we’re wearing them.”

“It’s no different than getting your shoes shined at a stand at the airport or train station. You don’t take them off then,” Mason added, unnecessarily. 

“I think it actually feels good to have my shoes buffed when I’m wearing them,” Natalie continued. “It’s almost like a mini massage. But of course you can get a real foot massage anytime you like. Your father has actually become very good at them. He gets a lot of practice.” Dear god, I thought to myself, was this conversation really happening?

“Maybe another time for a massage. That seems a little weird, to be honest,” Ryan said, mercifully. Then looking up at me, where I was standing attentively with the wooden kit on the floor next to my high heels, Ryan commanded, “Shine them now. Make sure to remove the scuff marks on the toe of my right shoe.”

As I got down on my knees in front of my son, Natalie went on with her little speech: “Weird is a relative term, honey. There’ll be a period of adjustment, but before you know it, what seems weird now will seem perfectly natural to you. For instance, I’m quite certain that your father found it weird the first time he knelt before Mason and massaged his feet, but now doing so is like second nature to him. Isn’t that right, Henrietta?”

“Yes, ma’am. You are entirely correct, as always.” 

In reality, she was totally INcorrect, of course, and I was lying through my teeth. Massaging Mason’s feet has never felt “perfectly natural” to me. I have done it now countless times, I do it multiple times per week most every week, and it is a singularly unnatural, surreal and intensely distasteful and humiliating experience EVERY time I do it, without exception. It’s not that Mason’s feet themselves are disgusting or particularly unattractive – they are not, just large and often pungent, especially after he has been walking around for a long time and sweating in his socks and shoes. It is rather that there are so many other things I find objectionable about the act: that, while I’ve always had a fetish for beautiful female feet, it has never extended to male feet; that pressing my fingers into the bare flesh of the lowest extremity of a man who holds such dominion over me is an act of intimacy that I find deeply shameful; that I almost always massage his feet with my wife as an over eager spectator, so that the symbolism of the act is always paramount. 

Natalie continued to press her point to Ryan: “You understand what I mean, honey, don’t you? Life is extraordinary. Our lives in particular. Never be constrained by convention. Within reason, of course. What I’m trying to say, dear, is take what’s rightfully yours and never be ashamed of it. Am I making sense?”

“I think so, Mom. I think I understand.” 

“I hope so. You are highly intelligent, physically strong and someone of strong character. A true alpha male. Your father is numerically brilliant, but he is sorely lacking in many other types of intelligence. Like emotional intelligence and judgment. He is physically weak and someone of even weaker character. He is a true beta male. What could be more natural than the weak serving the strong, especially when the weak one in this case is such a petty, nasty, morally degenerate man who used his power, when he had it, to belittle, intimidate and bully those with less or no power. No, my dear, nothing could be more natural than what’s happening right now. On top of everything else, it’s poetic justice. Take what is rightfully yours and give your sad excuse of a father what he so richly deserves. Or, perhaps I should say, what he so poorly deserves, as there is no longer anything remotely rich about him. Haha. Convention be damned! Make me proud, honey.”

Make her proud, indeed. I have already remarked upon Natalie’s skills as an actress, but her skills at persuading and manipulating her son and others around her to do what she wants are no less formidable.

Everyone was then silent for the next several minutes as I applied polish to Ryan’s shoes, and vigorously buffed them. I felt his toes wiggle and shift through the leather as I worked. As I looked up, I saw big smiles on Natalie’s and Lorena’s faces and a faintly amused expression on Mason’s. Ryan’s expression wavered between contempt and studied boredom/indifference – which, I suspected, was precisely the expression Natalie and Lorena were hoping for from him as I abased myself at his feet, my knees grinding into the hardwood floor and my perfidious cock grinding against its cage. The silence in the room seemed to bestow this moment with special import. I had to buff his right shoe multiple times, till my arm muscles were strained, to meet Ryan’s expectations.

At one point, towards the end of my 30 minute shoe shining session, Natalie rubbed salt into my wounds by saying to Mason and Lorena, “Isn’t this a special moment? Ryan has been estranged from his father for years, and he hasn’t even been back home for a day yet and they are already bonding.” 

On Thanksgiving morning, I was up at 5 AM and continued to clean (now in my practical, blue uniform) for a couple of hours, before serving breakfast to Mason, Natalie, Ryan and Lorena.

Lorena said, “It’s so nice to have you back in the house, Mr. Ryan.”

“Please, Lorena. You can’t keep calling me mister. First of all, it makes me feel old, and I’m younger than you. Second, it’s just not right. Please call me Ryan.”

“Okay, Ryan. Thanks,” Lorena said with a wide smile. 

“May I refresh your coffee, sir?” I asked Ryan. 

“No. Make me some tea,” he replied, curtly. “Ask Miss Lorena if she would like more coffee first.” 

Apparently, Ryan’s misgivings about being treated in a privileged manner by domestic servants did not apply to his own father. Then again, perhaps it had less to with any high minded notion of egalitarianism than simply him being physically attracted to Lorena. Who wasn’t? Or maybe he had decided to make an exception for me, as Natalie had urged him, because I had believed I was entitled to such privilege prior to my downfall, so that whatever indignities I suffered now were comeuppance. 

“Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Miss Lorena, may I get you some more coffee?”

“I’ll have a cup of tea, too, Henrietta,” she replied with a little laugh. Lorena thought it was a riot that the formerly overbearing “Mr. Hathaway” had been reduced to junior maid “Henrietta.”

After breakfast, I resumed work in the kitchen while Natalie, Mason and Ryan took another walk and later watched a football game. I resented having to interrupt my meal preparation to bring them beers and sandwiches as they reclined on the couch in front of the 100 inch TV I had purchased the previous Christmas as a gift for Natalie. 

At 2 PM, about an hour before guests were scheduled to begin arriving, Natalie asked Lorena to supervise me getting dressed. There was a bit of a dilemma in that Natalie wanted me to greet the guests, and serve them, in one of my formal serving uniforms, but I could easily soil my uniform with all of the cooking I had to do. She selected my second shortest uniform, only about an inch longer than the one I wore yesterday to introduce my new status to my son; it still revealed what I believed to be an indecent amount of thigh (of course, as they were my thighs, I believed any amount to be indecent). Especially with the impossibly sheer Agent Provacateur seamed stockings Natalie chose. Lorena checked to ensure that the DOMINIX was securely in place. Quite superfluously, I thought, she grabbed my shaved balls through the ring and tugged on them, causing my cock to bulge against the black steel rings. I moaned involuntarily and she giggled. 

The solution to the uniform dilemma was that I wear a long, protective apron over my uniform (which had a white satin and lace pinafore of its own, of course, but one that was purely decorative) while working in the kitchen. It was annoying, as well as time consuming, to put on and remove the apron all afternoon as I went back and forth between the kitchen and the rooms where the guests were gathered. But what’s a maid to do? Other than silently endure and work more diligently, that is. 

The first guests to arrive were Daphne, Scott and Miranda. I greeted all of the guests at the front door and then took them into the living room where Natalie, Mason and Ryan were waiting. Simple enough, you may think: “Hello, miss, sir, ma’am” Deep curtsy. “May I take your coats? Please allow me to escort you to the living room where Mistress Natalie, Master Mason and Master Ryan are looking forward to welcoming you. It’s so wonderful to have young Master Ryan home.” However, the entire time I did and said these things, it was impossible for me not to be hyper aware that last year on Thanksgiving, it was Lorena (attired in a fetching uniform of her own, though probably not as short as the one I was then wearing) who greeted the guests and escorted them to the living room where I held court, sipping my fine single malt scotch in my recliner by the fireplace. I say held court, not because I was some great conversationalist who commanded the room, but rather because it was my mansion, I was a billionaire, and people just naturally paid deference to me. What a difference a year makes! 

Miranda was particularly delighted to see her nephew, with whom she has always been close. “I can’t believe how tall you are, Ryan. And you’ve really filled out. Look at your shoulders and your chest! Let me see your bicep.”

“Come on, Aunt Miranda, you’re embarrassing me,” Ryan said, smiling.

“Come on, let’s see it!” Miranda persisted.

When he flexed his muscle, Miranda felt it bulging through his snug fittting, blue polo shirt. It was clear that he had long, well defined legs beneath his brown khaki pants, also on the tight side. The leather shoes I had so thoroughly polished were glistening in the afternoon sunlight filtering in through the living room windows.

 I had to admit that Ryan is an impressive looking young man. The question is whether or not I am entitled to take any pride whatsoever in that fact. Ryan clearly resembles his mother, but what about me? People always used to say that Ryan had my nose. I thought I detected some facial resemblance, but it’s hard to say for sure. That’s where any resemblance between us ends, however. Whereas I have thin, straight, light brown hair, Ryan’s hair was darker (closer to black), wavier and thicker, more like his mother’s. He is already 3-4 inches taller than me and may still be growing. With respect to our relative size and length in other areas, when Ryan was only 9 years old, I remember overhearing Natalie tell her sister Miranda on the phone (with a derisive laugh) that he was already better endowed than I was. Rather than confront her about it at the time, I remember passively aggressively berating her about some completely unrelated, trivial matter the next day. If I recall correctly, I also snapped at Ryan for playing too loudly with his friends, a petty act of retribution that no doubt embarrassed him. For what? For being physically superior to me well before he hit puberty. As if it was his fault.

But I had done some Internet research at the time, and there was some truth to what Daphne’s friend Leah had said the other night about genes: not only the Y chromosome, but the X chromosome can influence penis and testicle size, as could environmental factors. I had seen my father naked a couple of times growing up, and, while by no means well hung, he was certainly larger than I am (he is now deceased). I obviously had no idea of Ryan’s size today, but if what Natalie had said nine years earlier was true, one could only imagine. So, it remains inconclusive as to whether I am, in fact, Ryans’s biological parent. I suspected that he was wondering the same thing.

“That’s amazing. Daphne, you’ve got to feel this bicep,” Miranda said. Unsurprisingly, Daphne did not hesitate. Ryan blushed slightly at all the female attention, but was clearly eating it up. Miranda continued: “If you keep spending so much time in the gym, pretty soon Scott and Mason are going to have some serious competition in the hunk department.”

“Mom!” Daphne objected. “You can’t say those things. You’re embarrassing Ryan.”

“Nonsense. Ryan, take off your shirt for a minute. Show us what you’ve got.”

“Mom!”

“No, it’s okay. Just for a minute,” said Ryan, pulling off his shirt. With his sculpted pectoral muscles, broad shoulders, veined, muscular arms, six pack abs and lean waist,  Ryan was indeed quite the physical specimen. Especially for an 18-year old. Daphne’s likening his physique to that of a young Greek god was not far off base. He was not yet as muscular as Scott or Mason, but it was not difficult to envision that he could soon surpass both of them. 

“Wow!” Miranda said. “You look incredible, Ryan. Well, one thing’s for sure: you certainly aren’t a chip off the old block.” At this point, Miranda suddenly grabbed my arm and pulled it upwards. She then grasped my bicep, bare beneath the white lace trim of the shirt sleeve of my uniform.

“Now, you flex, Henrietta,” she commanded. Ryan had already put his shirt back on, ostensibly still shy but humoring the four females in the room (including Lorena) – while, in reality, I had no doubt that he was delighted to show off the fruits of his labors in the weight room.

“Haha, I can barely feel anything. The old block is in sorry shape,” Miranda said.

Everyone laughed heartily. I, of course, felt this was totally unfair. As I explained earlier, I used to work out with a personal trainer who had me use only light weights. While I had not seen my trainer in over six months, my days now are filled with lifting light weights – dishes, tea kettles, coffee pots, serving trays, brooms, vacuums, etc. – and I work/exercise almost constantly. I was clearly nowhere near as strong as the other three males in the room, but I am not without muscle tone; my muscles do not sag. 

Next to arrive were Scott, the IT executive at my old firm who assisted Mason in discovering and documenting my financial crimes, and his wife, Aimee. Both were in their late thirties. What was notable about them is that Scott is a relatively unattractive man, sort of a stereotypical computer geek (on the scrawny side, thick glasses, receding hair, etc.), whereas Aimee is a good looking blond – slender and shapely, with intense, green eyes and a memorable face (a bit asymmetric, perhaps, but still quite attractive). Scott and I had mutually disliked each other even before he assisted Mason in ending my career – in fact, ending my life as a free man (and, arguably, as a man at all). It’s hard to say when our animosity began. I would probably say it was his condescending attitude when I requested his technical support with my investment team’s data modeling. He would probably say it was when I subsequently complained to his boss, the Chief Technology Officer, by calling him “an incompetent, arrogant little prick.”

In any case, when he and Aimee arrived on Thanksgiving, I greeted them with the obligatory curtsy. “Welcome Mr. And Mrs. Isles. Please let me take your coats and then I can show you to the living room where Master Mason, Mistress Natalie and Master Ryan are visiting with Mistress Natalie’s sister, brother-in-law and niece.” 

That’s when it occurred to me that Scott, my former co-worker, had the first name as my brother-in-law. I had hand written the table placards, per Natalie’s instructions, but had not differentiated between the two Scotts; I would have to fix that before everyone sat down to eat to avoid confusion that could get me into trouble. Natalie had carefully chosen where each person would sit, so that people wouldn’t interact only with their spouses or family members but talk to the guests they had never met before or had only met once or twice. You may have deduced that my wife is somewhat of a control freak.

“Great uniform, Hathaway. It really suits you,” said Scott. 

“Thank you, sir.”

“Wow, you weren’t kidding. He really is Mason’s little maid now,” said Aimee.

Scott Isles had seen me dressed twice before, once during the summer when he came over for a swim and I served him and Mason drinks by the pool and the second time in early October when he was Mason’s guest for lunch. I served lunch as well, needless to say. Aimee is in media sales, and apparently travels extensively for work, so Thanksgiving was the first time she had laid eyes on the new me. The new and reduced me. Reduced waistline. Reduced ego. Reduced sanity, perhaps? 

No, not sanity. At least not yet. Desperate for sexual relief, no question. But still lucid and still intellectually curious. Curious to see just how far Natalie and Mason would take things. And giving serious thought to Natalie’s advice that I embrace my humiliation, surrender to it, and try to derive some kind of satisfaction or meaning from it – however twisted or fleeting that might be. It seemed to me, however, that the only type of satisfaction one could possibly derive from the level of humiliation I was being subjected to is sexual. Sexual masochism, to be precise – a double edged sword under the best of circumstances. And how was that even possible with my cock in a nearly perpetual state of incarceration?

“He’s lucky he’s not the maid for an entire cell block at Attica Correctional Facility,” said Scott. Oh, how I despise him. 

“I know Mason and Natalie, of course, but who in the hell is Master Ryan?” Aimee asked. 

“Ryan is your son, isn’t he Hathaway?” Scott asked.

“Yes, sir.”

“Wow, he calls his son master? He really IS a loser. This mansion is amazing, though. Must be hell to clean, I bet,” said Aimee, smirking at me. I had only met her a couple of times before, but could tell that I would like her as much as I did her husband the more time I spent with her.

“Take us to your master,” said Scott, like an alien addressing an earthling in a bad science fiction movie. 

Mason’s daughter, Piper, was the last to arrive. I hadn’t met her previously, but I had picked up a fair amount of information about her from overhearing Mason and Natalie discuss her. Piper was the sole offspring of Mason’s first and (so far, at least) only marriage. He and his wife divorced about 10 years ago, when Piper was nine, and they had joint custody of their daughter until she went away to college on the West Coast last year at age 18. Natalie had not yet met her, as Piper had spent the summer studying abroad in Vienna. A supposedly beautiful, strong willed young woman, she was now a sophomore at Stanford studying psychology.

As I was working in the kitchen awaiting her arrival, I thought back to a conversation about her between Natalie and Mason a couple of months ago. I was organizing and dusting Natalie’s extensive shoe closet, part of the cavernous walk-in closet off the master bedroom, where the two lovers were lying next to each other on the king side bed (my old bed – oh, how I missed that mattress!) in postcoital bliss, chatting. I had only been called in to lick Mason’s semen out of Natalie’s vagina on that occasion. Sometimes my involvement is greater – ranging from fluffing Mason’s cock with my mouth or lubricating Natalie’s clitoris with my tongue before they have sex, to licking or sucking their toes during the act. Of course, many times I am summoned before they have sex for for Mason to spank or even cane me, or otherwise humiliate me, simply as a form of foreplay for the two lovers; watching Mason abuse me invariably gets Natalie in the mood. But, as I explained, that morning, after eating what they refer to as my cream pie (Boston cream pie was on the menu for Thanksgiving, an inside joke – although I would not be eating that one unless there was a leftover slice), I had been permitted to wash my face and was working in the closet when I overheard the following:

“I always feel so relaxed after I’ve been well and truly fucked,” Natalie said, with a contented sigh.

“You certainly have been. And even lapped by the maid’s tongue,” Mason replied. 

“Yes, I’m living in the lap of luxury. Get it?”

“Terrible. Stick to acting, not comedy, baby.”

“You’re probably right. So, you spoke with Piper last night. How’s she doing?”

“Fine. She seems to be really enjoying psychology. She told me she actually wants to get a PhD in it now and to practice as a psychiatrist in a private clinic with wealthy patients, where she can do research.”

“That’s pretty ambitious for a sophomore, isn’t it?”

“She’s always been incredibly ambitious. She knows what she wants.”

“Sort of like you, darling.”

“I guess so, in some ways, although her interests are quite different. She is developing a real interest in the psychology of sexual deviancy. And mind control.” Talk about a chip off the old block.

“Really? How interesting. Perhaps she should interview Henrietta, then. I’m sure she would find his story fascinating.”

“That’s not a bad idea. But probably not until she’s further along in her studies.”

“Well, I can’t wait to finally meet her.”

I found this conversation to be particularly vexing, for a number of reasons.  I wanted to yell out from the closet: “Interview me?! I’m not the one who’s making my cuckolded husband or my former business rival live the life a sissified maid 24/7. I’m not the sadist who gets off on punishing him or watching him be punished. I’m not the man who forces another man to suck my cock as a display of power. Piper shouldn’t be interviewing me! She should be interviewing the two of you! You’re the true sexual deviants in this house.”

But, of course, I didn’t. I remained quiet on the outside as I fumed internally, and focused on my task.",2,1733503042.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Special dining was cancelled the day before with no notice whatsoever","I was teasing my wife because she kept checking our planned activities and reservations several times a day. I told her to chill out, saying, ""You already booked everything.""

Well, she was right, and I was not. While on a 7-day Symphony cruise, one of our tours was removed the day before, and a special restaurant reservation at Wonderland was canceled the day before as well. We didn’t receive any notification or apology—these items were simply removed from our calendar.

The tour was a special price, and they claimed they had to cancel it because not enough people signed up. That was a complete lie because my wife had been trying to book it for a while, and only managed to snag it when someone else canceled.

The Wonderland situation was even more bizarre. The customer service agent said, ""Hmm, this is odd,"" and called the restaurant manager. As the conversation progressed, he became increasingly awkward and finally said, *""But they’re asking me to explain why you canceled it—what am I supposed to tell them?""*  
Then he broke the news: Wonderland was fully booked. After we pressed him, they somehow ""found"" a spot for us. During the entire 30-minute conversation, he never apologized.

This was our first time cruising with Royal, and it’s likely our last. We’ve cruised many times before with other companies, but this experience fell short.

* Our room was very dirty. The steward was rarely around, and we found someone else’s hair and sand everywhere.
* My son was served a mocktail with alcohol in it.
* The teen club was a joke—basically a ""go entertain yourself"" setup.
* Activities like FlowRider, which they hype in advertisements, were mostly reserved for private or group sessions that cost extra. Public access was limited to just a few hours a day.
* The food in the main restaurants was just okay—some days it wasn’t good at all. Specialty restaurants were better, but honestly on par with the free restaurants offered by Celebrity or Princess cruises.
* The coffee, even the paid options, was disgusting. I couldn’t understand why people stood in line for Starbucks—until I tried the free and paid coffee on the ship. I literally spat it out.

On the positive side:

* The waitstaff were great, although I didn’t appreciate them reminding us four times to leave a ""10-star"" review.
* Embarkation and debarkation were impressively efficient, especially given the size of the ship.
* The crowd was mostly middle-aged and families with kids, which we liked.

However, the teen club was a major disappointment compared to Celebrity Edge or Ascent.

I had high expectations for the production shows but was underwhelmed, mostly due to the horrendous sound quality. The audio was painfully loud, with overboosted highs and no lows, making it hard to understand the singing. Oddly, they didn’t have shows every night—on a 7-day cruise, there were two days without any shows because they repeated the same ones three times.

If I were to rate the experience on a scale of 1 to 10, I’d give it a 6. Royal Caribbean could learn a lot from their sister company, Celebrity.",3,1733503025.0,royalcaribbean,6,0.62,False

What to do with my WG host (German, 51, Divorced) acting all weird, probably in a depression, stopped eating, stopped drinking coffee he was doing like 5 times a day, probably it's been like this for a week now.  
  
Today he stopped feeding his cat and do toilet cleaning, which I found the most terrible thing because cats can't do shit by themselves. I knocked his room, asked if he has more food for the cat and he said NO and he's not feeling well, that's it, so I just went to shop a few minuites ago.  
  
He still smokes in his room and goes to bathroom for toilet but I don't think he's taking shower either like for a week, I can hear the sound.  
  
I don't think his son is dead because I assume he should have been busy preparing the funeral?  
Maybe he's found he has a final stage of cancer, lost hard in gambling?  
I told him to tell me if anything's wrong but he only said he's difficult and not feeling well.  
  
Actually he asked me to hang out ( a week ago ) which never happent before and I thought it's good, but since then he started poking my privacy too much and I wasn't really comfortable at all, like he came to come into my room after midnight, I told him to stop...he understood and I still wanted to go out for a bar, to hear what's happening to him but two days ago he rejected this plan by saying he's not feeling like it.  
After the incident he told me how grateful he is to have me as a roommate, so I think something is up to him...

For more ref, he was never like this.  
He's introverted but he talks when we meet in the kitchen or we shared a nice moment like so, we said we liked each other (not like lovers) and I did trust him, such a good German man with a cute cat. He sometimes bakes a cake or often cooks meal for himself and kept himself clean. He's not a bad person at all. 

Also I never feel like he wanted to have sex with me, he already said he find me like a daughter.

He's not opening up anymore and I hope he doesn't hang himself.  
I don't know his fson's number, or ex wife, I don't think he has friends after observing him for 3 months since I started living in here.  
I don't think police could help because he doesn't do much yet, I could think of Berlin hotlife but it's not my shit but I'm kinda afraid he's going to do suicide at some point. I don't know what to do:(",12,1733502882.0,berlin,12,0.81,False

Let me first just say that I am SURE somebody has contemplated this before, but let me have this today... I literally gasped like Aziraphale when he got double-crossed by Nazis when this thought plopped in my brain mid-teeth-brushing this morning. 😂

The Metatron stops at Give Me Coffee or Give Death. He asks if anyone ever picks death. He is asking not only facetiously, but also literally, because he is about to give Aziraphale the same choice. Take the coffee and drink it, or choose death. (Potentially only, of course! Until/if learn more about that moment in S3.) 

Aziraphale is smart enough to have definitely picked up on the message. The view from his desk is the coffee shop, after all--he sees the words ""Give Me Coffee or Give Me Death"" all the time. 

Not to mention the *gestures erratically* Everything Else going on with the scene. That Aziraphale never drinks coffee. That The Metatron is wearing black. That Aziraphale knows how dangerous Heaven is at this point. That he was literally also about to admit his feelings for Crowley at that party, if the demons hadn't shown up (at least if the tweets/Tumblr posts Ne*l was liking after the S2 finale came out are any indication).

A bit about me: Early 30's, single, male. Don't drink but still party. Pretty active lifestyle (think gym 5-7 days a week, outdoor activities/sports, etc). Into live music, especially EDM shows/festivals. Big foodie. Enjoy checking out art galleries, pop up shops, thrifting, reading books at coffee shops, and checking out a (hopefully) decent nightlife. Would like a decent dating scene but seems like its garbage across the board. I've lived in big cities and small rural towns, currently living in large southwestern city. I'll be working anywhere from 55-80h a week, so my time outside of the hospital is extremely precious. I would prefer to be somewhere that it's easy to go enjoy it at a moments notice and/or be able to always have something to do.

My options:

**Chicago**: Would have to switch between hospitals that are located in the South Side and some up along the North Shore (a nearly 1.5h commute according to google maps). Is this worth being in what is arguably the most exciting city on this list?

**Minneapolis**: Little freaked out about the winters. Already know some people who live here though, so that's a plus.

**Nashville**: Is it as bad as everyone says on here? Visited once and had a blast, but I know that's not real life. I also know some people who live here so would have some support.

**Charlotte**: Same questions as Nashville - is it really that bad? Never been.

**Dallas**: Been multiple times. The city is just alright, but training is great and family would be closer than in other spots above. 

**Atlanta**: This place seems pretty polarizing. I've heard its hot and humid though which I'm not too keen on. No connections here.",7,1733502776.0,SameGrassButGreener,23,0.89,False

As someone on the Autism spectrum who has a life outside of the game, but is deeply invested in its content, its hard for me to keep up with the updates, content, what i wish to do with the characters i own, all while 'surviving' the real world, so I want to create something that helps ease the 'thinking burden' some of us have while also serving both newcomers and veteran players alike, all while being accessible to all. My goal is to build an app that’s not only welcoming to players with different needs, but also highly functional for those who, like me, are passionate about the game.

The app will help players organize their thoughts and notes about the game in one place—everything from deciding which characters to level up, tracking resource costs, figuring out the best places to gather said resources, and more. It’s all about providing an easy-to-use tool that keeps everything well-organized and accessible.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas on the features you’d like to see! So far, I’m thinking of including the following:

* **Teambuilder**: Create and manage your dream team.
* **Character Builder**: Track each character’s resource cost and where to find the materials needed.
* **Character Order Builder**: A customizable list to help you prioritize which characters to level up first, second, third, etc., based on your goals and resource availability.

I want to be transparent: this app will be completely free for all users—no in-app purchases, no subscriptions. However, I’m considering adding a donation option (like a ""Buy Me a Coffee"" link) to help cover development costs and allow me to focus more on improving the app. But that’s something we can discuss later!

If you’re a programmer or have experience with app development, I’d love to get advice or eventually collab! Whether you have tips on the best tools, or just guidance on how to make this app both user-friendly and efficient, your input would be hugely appreciated. The more minds working, the better this can become, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in helping or just want to chat about how to bring this project to life. I will avoid putting my social media here as i don't know if can (very sorry mods), but you can contact me on bluesky on my profile directly for a quicker message. 

I’m excited to hear your feedback and hope this project can become a helpful tool for everyone. Thank you for reading so far, and I look forward to growing this with all of you!

Much love to my fellow Arcanists!",8,1733502695.0,Reverse1999,0,0.79,False

I accidentally called their emergency line which was the number 5 instead of 911. Kept apologizing to the operator that called me back because I had no idea pressing the number 5 would call the emergency line. I all of a sudden jumped down a sandy/rocky ravine to save a lady who fell in some water and on the way down I ran past 2 giant venomous snakes that were bright blue with black spots. Felt no fear towards them and they didn’t hurt me. I go to a party where I meet a bunch of Australians and we shared stories of what it's like to live there and back in the US. All of the sudden I look over and see the Sydney opera house and start crying. It was so beautiful in my dream I was so amazed and in awe. I was all of a sudden in a coffee shop and some guys started stealing stuff out of my bag and I saw them take my kindle. I started screaming at them to stop and offered them $500 if they would give it back. I waited until the guy approached me and I grabbed it back from him and grabbed onto him so he could be apprehended 🥵 I then saw a guy swim across a giant pond and get eaten by crocodiles ,1,1733502689.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

I’m super excited to let you know that I’ve finally rolled out **Version 2** of SafeMP3.cc. It’s been a long road getting here, with a ton of trial and error, but it’s done! Here’s what’s new and what this means for you:

# What’s Changed?

* **New Conversion System**: I’ve completely rewritten how the site handles conversions. The process is smoother and should feel a bit faster, even though I’m still working with the same hardware.
* **More Conversions at Once**: The new system can handle way more people converting at the same time. It’s a big upgrade from the bottlenecks we had before, so you shouldn’t feel stuck waiting in line as often.
* **Proxies!** Thanks to the awesome people who donated, I’ve added some proxies to the mix. That means I’m less stressed about YouTube banning the IP address. The proxies are paid for the next month, so let’s hope this keeps things running smoothly for a while.
* **General Improvements**: The backend is much cleaner now, and everything is more organized. You probably won’t notice that part, but it makes my life a lot easier when debugging or tweaking things.

# What’s Next?

Even though I’m proud of this update, I’m already looking ahead to the next step. Starting now, I’m rewriting the entire code (again) to make the system **scalable**. Here’s the plan:

* **More Servers**: The next version will allow me to add servers whenever they’re needed. This will keep things running smoothly, even if the site gets busier.
* **Bigger Proxy Pool**: With more proxies, I can reduce the risk of IP bans even further. This will help keep the site stable and reliable.
* **Faster Conversions**: I’m looking into ways to make the whole process even quicker. The goal is to reduce waiting times as much as possible.

* **Longer Conversions**: small limits as the 15 min one set in place right now, will be a thing of the past

* **Some Secret Ideas**: I’ve got a few other things planned, but I’ll keep those a surprise for now. Let’s just say there’s more to come!

# Thank You!

I can’t thank you all enough for being part of this project. Whether you’ve been using the site, giving feedback, or donating, it’s all been a huge help. Every little bit has made this possible, and I hope you feel proud of what we’ve built so far.

And to the people who donated—you’re absolute legends. Because of you, I was able to get proxies up and running, which gives me some peace of mind and keeps the site alive. Thank you for the coffee and for keeping this project afloat.

This is the final version of the current site. The next phase is all about scaling it up and making it bigger, faster, and more stable. I’ve got a lot of work ahead, but I’m excited to see where this goes.

Thanks again for sticking with me through all the ups and downs. Let me know if you run into any issues, and I’ll do my best to sort them out.

Here’s to the future of SafeMP3.cc!

Cheers,

**South Lake Tahoe** *""Where Californians pretend they live in Nevada to avoid taxes but still complain about casino traffic.""*  This is where a $200-a-night “lakeside” motel actually overlooks a parking lot, and every tourist thinks their Prius can climb Echo Summit in a snowstorm.  And don’t forget the elusive locals’ discount—rumored to exist, but only for people who’ve worked at Heavenly for 10 winters and know a guy.

**Stateline** *""The place where you gamble with both your money and your patience trying to park at Heavenly Village.""* Stateline is for people who want to gamble but don’t want the bright lights of Vegas. Instead, they get the dim casino lighting that hides spilled margaritas and shattered hopes. Locals dodge tourists like it’s a contact sport while somehow squeezing into that one Safeway.

**Incline Village** *""Where millionaires live like billionaires and billionaires complain about it.""* It’s the only place where the HOA fines are higher than your mortgage. You’ll find a $10,000 ski rack on a Range Rover that hasn’t seen snow, and locals still don’t understand why Starbucks doesn’t deliver directly to their dock.

**Kings Beach** *""Where the beach days are glorious and the parking tickets are plentiful.""* Kings Beach is the land of “fun for the whole family”—as long as the kids don’t mind a two-hour wait for pizza and Dad doesn’t cry over the parking ticket he just got. And who needs sunscreen when you have the gift shop’s $20 bucket hat?

**Tahoe City** *""Basically Truckee's little brother who still thinks they're the coolest.""* Tahoe City thinks it’s the Every new business claims to be “local-friendly” until their $16 avocado toast says otherwise. The locals pretend to hate tourists, but without them, Fanny Bridge would just be a place where ducks poop.

**Truckee** *""The land of 'locals-only' stickers and $10 pour-over coffees.""* Truckee is where everyone’s a “mountain person,” but they still complain about REI being too far. They invented the concept of upscale flannel—if it doesn’t cost at least $200, it’s probably not warm enough for the brewery patio.

**Carnelian Bay** *""Carnelian Bay: Where the only thing wilder than the waves is the HOA drama.""""* This is the land of second homeowners who somehow never realize their boat needs registration… or gas. Meanwhile, the one local café is where old-timers swap stories about when Tahoe was still ""undiscovered,"" ignoring the fact that they’re currently sipping turmeric lattes.

**Zephyr Cove** *""The Hamptons of Tahoe if the Hamptons came with jet skis and beer coolers.""* Every summer weekend, Zephyr Cove turns into a country song: trucks, dogs, and questionable life choices. The rental kayaks are just overpriced excuses to spy on mansion backyards, and the party boats have a 50/50 chance of running aground on a sandbar.

**Tahoma** *""Live Edge Tables & Long Drives: The Town.*"" Tahoma is where people “escape the chaos” of Tahoe City, only to discover the chaos is just bears rummaging through their compost. Everyone here owns snowshoes but secretly wishes they could afford a snowmobile.

**Crystal Bay** *""Why gamble at Stateline when you can do it here and tell yourself it’s 'quaint'?""* Crystal Bay is a lesson in extremes: either you’re staying in a multi-million-dollar Airbnb, or you’re at the slot machines in the Tahoe Biltmore, where time has stopped since 1983. The only thing brighter than the neon lights is the glare from the ski bros debating which powder was the “gnarliest.”

**Meyers** *""South Lake's hipster cousin who 'hates South Lake' but still shops there.""* Meyers loves to tell you it’s “not South Lake,” but the locals still drive there for pizza and beer. The community meetings are all about keeping things “authentic,” as long as authenticity doesn’t mean fixing the potholes.

**BONUS ROASTS: General Tahoe Truths**

* **Tourists with Chains:** The annual winter ritual of tourists figuring out how chains work in the middle of the highway. “Wait, you’re supposed to put them on *before* sliding into the ditch?”
* **Subarus Everywhere:** Tahoe is 50% forest, 50% Subarus. If you don’t own one, are you even a local?
* **The Weather Dilemma:** It’s either “the best snow we’ve had in decades” or “seriously, where’s the snow?” There’s no in-between.
* **Bear-Proof Trash Cans:** Spoiler alert: They’re really just “bear-resistant” at best.
* **Tahoe Time:** Nothing gets done on schedule here. If someone says, “We’ll meet at 3,” you know they’ll show up at 3:30 with a kombucha and a story about traffic on 89.",35,1733502565.0,tahoe,11,0.81,False

. . . . . . . . 



Hey, I hope it's ok to vent about this here. I'm having a bit of a rough time.

So, I basically had to cut contact with my mom and stepdad. It was a huge, drawn-out thing that started because of an argument we had 2 years ago. This caused me to move out. They were saying some racist stuff and didn't like that I called them out on it. And then they gave me the silent treatment for a week, were extremely rude to a friend of mine who came to visit me, and then they said I had to apologize for their behavior. Classic DARVO. 

This was the part I was extremely upset about because they've never treated my friends like that before and there was also an added layer of racism and queerphobia here. I would consider us friends but I did have a massive crush on her at one point, which I told my mom about. And my friend is also mixed race but her dad is from Liberia and her mom is white. So clearly, they're racist. And this is not the first time they've expressed racist views but it was the first time they exploded at me. Like my stepdad was slamming things around in the kitchen and my mom gave me every excuse you could think of. She literally said ""I'm not racist, I don't see color, my family never owned slaves."" Which is the most white thing she could have said. My stepdad is also white, for clarification. And he's no better. A lot of his anecdotes are quite racist and he kept expecting me to laugh at them. 

(I should also clarify for context, I am mixed race South Asian and white, queer, trans and autistic. And all of these things are issues for them. They do not respect me for any of my identities). 

At the time, I apologized mostly just to keep the peace. But it was the emptiest apology I've ever given. I basically quit my job, went back to school, and got my current job. And then I was able to move out. During this time, they pretended like everything was fine. But I don't think I can explain the betrayal I felt. I felt like they stabbed me in the back, and it was like I was seeing them for who they really are: incredibly emotionally immature.

Anyway, they helped me with moving and setting up my new place, painting and putting lights up. But I just kept feeling so uncomfortable that they were helping me because we weren't addressing the root issue. So in March, I told them I needed some space, and they freaked out. I asked her not to contact me unless it was an emergency.

My mom sent me a spreadsheet saying I owed her money for all the stuff they did. That just absolutely broke my heart, but I gave her money for the first one.

Fast forward to May, my grandma died. She was my dad's mom, and we were not close. I messaged my mom saying she passed. My mom didn't come to the funeral, but instead asked me if she should. She and my grandma didn't get along. So it really felt like she was putting me in the middle of their beef, and I was really annoyed.

In July, she sent me another spreadsheet saying I owed her for the kitchen table and guest bed they said I could use. And she said I had to give her the coffee table back. This was hurtful for me because she gave it to me, and it was made by my great-grandpa. It meant a lot that she gave it to me since he died when I was 10, and it was an honor that she trusted me with a gift. So, the fact that she basically held it over my head like that was so upsetting. I started getting worried they would just come over and demand I give them all my things. Where would they draw the line? I told her I wouldn't pay her. But I did give her the table back. And I hoped she would leave me alone.

But a couple of weeks ago, she messaged me saying my grandpa (her dad) was in the hospital. He fell and broke his spine. And then the next day, he had a stroke. I didn't reply right away, and she asked, ""Was this not emergency-worthy?"" So I said, ""I hope he's ok. Sad to hear this news."" But I was upset by her tone. So I poked the bear, and I regret it. I asked her what sort of response she was looking for because I did not have any sort of connection with my grandpa. He lives out of state, and we barely saw him at all growing up. And she had mentioned that she was going to fly out to see him, so I was confused about whether I was supposed to do that too, which didn't make sense to me. It's not that I don't care about him or wish him ill. There's just no relationship to speak of. He is going to be ok, BTW. He is going to do physical therapy.

She said I was self-centered, that she offered words of comfort when my grandma died (which she didn't actually). And she said I should think about how to be kinder towards the family who were there for me when I didn't reciprocate.

And I couldn't let it go. I said, ""Maybe you should take your own advice and ask yourself how you can be kinder towards your own child.""

Because she still didn't answer my question. I can't provide any sort of emotional support or grief counseling. I'm her kid. Not her parent.

I told her I would never forgive her for the spreadsheets. That pushed me over the edge. And I said that she's not right. Literally, every single person I have talked to about this whole mess has been like, ""What the hell? That's so f'd up."" And it is. Toxic behavior all around. But I expected better from them. I haven't actually talked to my stepdad since March, but she also tried to manipulate me with that, too. ""Oh, he thinks of you as his own daughter,"" even though I am also trans (that's a whole other story).

It's like they have this image of me and refuse to grow with me. They refuse to understand or hear what I'm saying. They can't see that they have hurt me, and it truly is all their fault. So I deleted her number and all the texts so I don't have to look at them anymore. I didn't go to the family gathering. And good riddance.

She's honestly no better than my dad, who is a real piece of work. And I was used to dealing with shit from him and his side of the family. They were the ones who caused my CPTSD in the first place. But I never thought my mom would turn around and weaponize my trauma against me. She knew just how to hurt and that's what made it worse. 

It really sucks to have to deal with this. I oscillate between feeling so proud of myself and feeling really sad and guilty. Because I don't think anyone wants to do this. But there was no other choice. Anyway, thank you for reading this. I'm hoping someone can relate.

Whether you're an experienced hiker or a first-time trekker, the journey to the base of Mount Everest is both challenging and rewarding. When planning for such an extraordinary trek, one of the most crucial considerations is the cost. This article will break down the **Everest Base Camp trek cost**, including the factors that influence it, and provide insights into how to plan your budget effectively.

# Overview of the Everest Base Camp Trek

The **Everest Base Camp Trek** (EBC Trek) takes trekkers through the breathtaking Khumbu region of Nepal, offering a chance to witness the grandeur of the world’s highest peak. The trek typically lasts around 12 to 14 days, depending on the route and acclimatization needs. While trekking through this rugged landscape, trekkers pass through Sherpa villages, Buddhist monasteries, and lush forests, ultimately reaching the base camp at 5,364 meters (17,598 feet).

The trek is not only a physical challenge but also a cultural and spiritual experience, as trekkers immerse themselves in the rich heritage of the region. But before you begin your journey, it's essential to understand the **cost of the Everest Base Camp trek** to make sure you’re fully prepared for this once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

# Key Factors Influencing the Everest Base Camp Trek Cost

The cost of the **Everest Base Camp trek** can vary based on several factors. Here’s a breakdown of the main elements that will affect the total cost of your trek:

# 1. Trekking Package Type

The most significant determinant of your trek’s cost is the type of trekking package you choose. **Himalayan Asia Treks** offers a variety of Everest Base Camp trek packages to suit different budgets and preferences. These include:

* **Standard Package**: This is an affordable option, with basic accommodations in teahouses along the trail, standard meals, and minimal additional services.
* **Luxury Package**: For those looking for more comfort, this package includes higher-end lodges, private guides, and porters, along with extra amenities such as heated rooms and better-quality meals.
* **Helicopter Return Package**: This option offers the opportunity to return by helicopter from **Everest Base Camp** instead of trekking back down, adding a touch of luxury and adventure to your experience.

The cost of the **Everest Base Camp trek 2025** will largely depend on which type of package you choose.

# 2. Trekking Duration

The length of the trek is another crucial factor in determining the overall cost. Most treks last around 12 to 14 days, but this can extend if you choose longer acclimatization days to ensure your safety at high altitudes.

# 3. Accommodation and Food

While trekking in Nepal, accommodation and food costs are relatively affordable compared to Western standards. However, there is a wide range of options available. Budget-friendly teahouses offer basic rooms and meals, but luxury lodges along the trail provide more comfort, higher-quality food, and additional services, which will increase the cost of the trek.

Meals on the **Everest Base Camp trek route** typically cost between $5 and $10 per day for basic meals. The price may increase as you reach higher altitudes.

# 4. Guide and Porter Services

Hiring a guide is strongly recommended for a safe and enriching experience. **Himalayan Asia Treks** offers experienced, English-speaking guides who provide valuable insights into the local culture, terrain, and safety protocols. The cost of a guide typically ranges from $25 to $40 per day, depending on the package and the number of days you trek.

If you want to reduce the physical strain, you can also hire a porter to carry your gear. Porters cost around $15 to $20 per day.

# 5. Permits and Fees

Trekking in Nepal requires permits that contribute to the overall **Everest Base Camp trek cost**. Some of the necessary permits are:

* **Sagarmatha National Park Permit**: This costs around $30 USD and is required to enter the park.
* **TIMS (Trekkers' Information Management System) Card**: This costs around $20 USD and is mandatory for trekkers.

There are also additional costs for **Everest Base Camp trek insurance**, which is a requirement for all trekkers to cover emergency evacuation, health issues, or accidents during the trek.

# 6. Flights

For most trekkers, the journey to the start of the trek begins with a flight from Kathmandu to **Lukla**. The **Lukla flight cost** can vary depending on the season, ranging from $150 to $250 one-way. Flights are subject to availability and weather conditions, which can sometimes cause delays or cancellations, adding additional costs to your trek.

# 7. Travel Insurance

Comprehensive **travel insurance** is a must for trekkers in Nepal. The **Everest Base Camp trek** involves a high level of risk, especially at altitudes above 4,000 meters. Insurance costs typically range from $50 to $150 for the duration of your trek, depending on the level of coverage, including evacuation and medical care.

# 8. Additional Costs

Additional costs to consider for your **Everest Base Camp trek budget** include:

* **Souvenirs and gifts**: You can find a variety of local handicrafts and souvenirs along the route.
* **Hot drinks and snacks**: Many trekkers enjoy hot drinks like tea, coffee, and hot chocolate, as well as snacks, which add to daily expenses.
* **Extra flights or hotel stays**: If you plan to stay longer or face delays, you might need to pay for additional accommodation or flights.

# Sample Everest Base Camp Trek Cost Breakdown

Let’s look at a general breakdown of **Everest Base Camp trek cost** for a typical 14-day itinerary:

1. **Trekking Package**:
   * Standard Package: $1,400 - $1,700
   * Luxury Package: $2,500 - $3,000
2. **Flights** (Kathmandu to Lukla, return): $300 - $500
3. **Permits and Fees**: $60 - $70
4. **Guide and Porter Services**: $300 - $600 (for 14 days)
5. **Accommodation and Meals**: $10 - $30 per day (total: $140 - $420)
6. **Travel Insurance**: $50 - $150
7. **Other Costs** (snacks, souvenirs, tips): $100 - $200

# Total Cost Estimation

* **Standard Everest Base Camp Trek**: $1,900 - $2,500
* **Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek**: $3,500 - $4,500

These estimates can fluctuate depending on the type of services and packages you select. The **Everest Base Camp trek cost 2025** may also increase due to inflation or changes in flight rates and permits.

# Conclusion

The **cost of trekking to Everest Base Camp** can vary significantly based on the type of trek package, accommodation choices, guide services, and other factors. By understanding the components of the trek cost and planning accordingly, you can ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience. **Himalayan Asia Treks** offers a range of packages to suit different budgets, allowing you to choose an option that aligns with your expectations and comfort level.

1h855dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dryalcoholics/comments/1h855dn/test_a_new_app_app_always_free/,Test a new app - app always free,"Hey all - Since I became sober (technically 2 years ago today!), I've been working on an app. It started out small, then I had an epiphany a couple months ago at a meeting. There's a stigma with asking for help. And most of the <40 year old generation want to start digitally.

It's called THE STRONG RISE. The idea is that we all have been weak at times, but rose up with strength. Rising Together, Stronger Than Ever.

I built an app that I need testers for. I can also use help with distribution and digital media. I want to build a team who can make this an amazing addition to all sorts of recovery.

It has a few cool things right now, but there are a lot more coming.

1. Counter - days + savings (basic, nothing amazing) - will become a 12 step journal eventually
2. Communities you can create or join (not going to lie, DayOne is one community I already created). You can post, read, get feedback
3. Follow people you care about. The main feed is a combo of posts from the people you follow + posts from communities you follow. You can like and comment now. Eventually, you will be able to repost and/or share
4. Chat with people you follow (eventually, I want to make this a dual sided confirmation audio/video tool - think sponsors talking with people in need real time)

So, right now, it's basically like a twitter mixed with reddit + i am sober app.

I plan to add quite a bit over the next month or so, including resources/AA links, personal 12 step process (no matter your addiction), sponsor finder, live video/meetings, and a lot more (it's just a matter of prioritizing).  
Anyway, I just need some people to agree to test. I have an iOS version ready - just need apple to approve. And I can sign an android version in the next week.

I really want FEEDBACK. I'm doing this as a non-profit and will accept donations in the app to support development and hosting fees. That's it. Other apps charge quite a bit for these features and I want to make it free to everyone. The app will always be free to everyone. I'm debating a tip jar to get ""verified"" and optional donations. But, that's it. Nobody has to pay. Any funds would go towards dev and hosting, with a potential growth angle of funding pastries, coffees, at meetings to present and maybe some other marketing ideas.

Anyway, if you're interested, please go to this google sheet below and fill in your email. I'll use that to either ask you questions or sign you up directly. All beta testers will get lifetime ""verified"" status (a feature I have yet to build, but will!). If you can help with dev or marketing, please let me know.

1h854cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyBreakRoom/comments/1h854cj/reading_the_vent_post_about_nannies_being/,"Reading the vent post about nannies being concerned about NPs income, on the employers sub......","\*\*DISCLAIMER obviously this doesn't apply to all NPs. Also, there's some NPs in that thread that truly get it and I see them and am so happy they're willing to respond with nuanced takes since nannies aren't allowed to post there and defend themselves.\*\*

And I was really shocked, and by shocked I mean totally not shocked that some of those NPs get really upset about nanny bonuses around the holidays and that ""reddit nannies are entitled for expecting a bonus when even I don't receive a bonus at my own corporate job!"". A lot of NPs there like to insinuate that a lot of nannies are young, have no REAL job experience, and no credible skills. But I've been in the corporate world before nannying. I've had all sorts of jobs that come with all types of benefits, and I'm here to tell you that these NPs may not receive bonuses, but they ARE receiving benefits that are commensurate with their education and experience. If they weren't then they couldn't even entertain the idea of hiring a nanny. It's not lost on me that NPs probably don't even think of their own job perks as benefits, but they definitely are benefits and it's EXTREMELY RARE that a nanny is even offered benefits beyond a few days of PTO/sick time. There will always be exceptions to every rule, but I'd bet dollars to doughnuts these NPs who make enough money to employ a nanny also work for companies that can afford to pay out benefits even if they're not in industries that historically pay bonuses. And what are those benefits that many NPs receive in addition to their base wage? (The dollar amounts listed below are specific to my spouse's benefits)

1. Health Insurance including dental and vision- usually partially paid by employer. Employer pays 50% which is about $800 per month. 

2. Mental Health services. For us that means free counseling at 4x per month through a telehealth app. 

3. Full free gym access that my spouse can access at their job. Saves us $60 per month in gym memberships.

4. Contributions to HSA/FSA accounts. $200 per month from employer in HSA account.

5. 401k or pension plan. My spouse's receives a 6% match from employer.

6. Performance bonus. This is usually around $500-$800 once a quarter.

7. Life Insurance. This is a $250,000 policy that is fully paid by employer with option to keep it if spouse ever leaves position.

8. Disability (STD and LTD), Accident, and Critical Illness Insurance. You can only access these policies through an employer, you cannot usually get these policies on your own privately. Though premiums are paid by my spouse, they are <$35 per month for all policies.

9. Commuter benefits. $100 per month reimbursement for parking and toll fees.

10. PTO. Accrues 2-3 days of PTO per month. This is used for regular vacation pay and sick leave.

11. Holidays. 12 paid annually.

12. Parental Leave. 6 weeks paid in the event of the birth of a child or an adoption. 

13. Family and Medical Leave. FMLA. A nanny will never receive this protection because a NF will never meet the requirements of the law to abide by the policy.

14. Bereavement Leave. 3 days annually.

15. Volunteer Time Off. 2 days paid annually to be used when spouse is doing volunteer work outside of company.

16. Annual raise of 2.5%-5%.

17. Remote work and flexible hours/schedule, compressed work week. Ability to leave for personal appointments while not using PTO. Spouse is Salaried non-exempt, so receives extra PTO for OT hours worked based on labor laws in the city employer is based out of.

18. Tuition reimbursement.

19. Mentoring and professional development.

20. Training and certification. 100% paid for by employer for all career related training.

21. Conferences and seminars. All expenses paid for by employer. Per diem, mileage, hotel, and airfare. 

22. Employee discounts. This is how we are able to afford Disney next year for our family. Access to private boxes for local sports team, and other heavily discounted local attractions.

23.  Meals and snacks. Many, many catered lunches. Coffee and pantry snacks available every day. All free to employees. 

Obviously these benefits will vary by employer. And there are some benefits that DO exist in the professional world that my spouse does NOT receive. Those are stock options, profit sharing, cell phone reimbursement, company retreats, Employee Assistance Program, Legal services, Employee Recognition awards, relocation assistance, PTO for civic engagement, etc. 

And my spouse's job is just a typical corporate job, BARELY six figures, and these are considered basic benefits on a VERY middle class salary. Meanwhile both my NPs work and each easily make double what my spouse brings in, but they can't/won't afford ANY of those benefits listed above apart from GH and an occasional sick day ONLY if it was clear one of their kids got me sick. Yep, you heard that right, no PTO for me at all. If I go on vacation it's all unpaid. 

So you see, I'm not too impressed with your LOW hourly wage and your lecture on why you think I'm entitled to a $200 bonus. I mean my god, that's the bare minimum when you're not offering benefits that on even on par with what Taco Bell is offering minimum wage workers. My spouse joked that his income subsidized my NPs childcare costs. 4 kids under 5 for $25 an hour in a HCOL city isn't great. The only reason I stay is because my working environment is tolerable and I have a lot of autonomy and a shortish commute. Also they did give me a nice bonus this year. But I will be moving on because I simply can't afford to keep working for them. But there are NPs out there trying to pay even less and expecting a LOT from their nannies. And just in case you didn't know it, yes YOU are worth your hourly wage and basic benefits. You are not entitled. This is just a part of employing people. I very much doubt these NP's would work only for an hourly wage and a week of PTO.",15,1733502119.0,NannyBreakRoom,5,0.8,False

I've done so many hours of lessons and tend to do mostly fine on those but then I choke on the exam. My first one was okay but I messed up a maneuver I NEVER did before: the three point turn. Bumped the curb, auto fail. This time? Even worse. 3 weeks since my first exam and I had only two lessons since because I had exams and came down with food poisoning the week before and also Thanksgiving. And then my physics professor decided to schedule an exam right before my road test and I had insomnia all the night before and then had to finish my physics exam in half the allotted time to make it to my road test. And then I had the worst panic attack of my life taking the road test. My hands were shaking the entire time. I always have insomnia before exams but in school exams, you have time to think and you're sitting down the entire time. You can keep your brain sharp with coffee/ gum or taking a cold shower right before. But driving is about motor skills. Not much you can do for that on low sleep. I've worked so hard and paid so much money to learn to drive and it's tougher for me because my parents don't drive and I don't have extended family nearby to help out. I feel so guilty about constantly asking my parents for driving lesson money. I just need to pass the exam and I'll be done but it keeps getting worse. I hate being a 20 year old without a license while everyone else around me has been driving for years. I'm from NYC so it's not as common there but going to college in upstate makes me feel so behind. I cried for 3 hours straight yesterday and the only reason it wasn't more was because my roommate was around and I couldn't bear to tell her about failing the exam. I just lied and said it was fine. I don't know what to do. I'm constantly wracked with the guilt of asking my parents for money for this while they are also paying for my college and the shame of not having my license while everyone else does. I'm sick of getting carted around from instructor to instructor. I started learning in NYC over summer break. She was nice but didn't really teach me. Then I switched to another when I moved back to uni. That instructor was honestly crappy and then I got a new instructor who taught me well but he just stresses me out sometimes. For small errors he's like ""They'd fail you for that"" and ""How are you going to pass the test like this?"" I just want my license but it feels like I'm turning all my parents' money to dust. I kind of resent that they never learned and taught me because everyone else learned from their parents or other family and I wouldn't have had to deal with paying a mixed bag of instructors. I really do want this. I did work hard. But failing twice, it feels like I'm throwing a pity party. It feels like I'm an okay driver sometimes but then if I failed twice, can I really call myself that? To anyone reading this, sorry this is so disorganized. I just feel like I've reached a breaking point with this. I'm a disappointment to my parents, my instructors, friends, and myself.",1,1733501911.0,drivinganxiety,1,1.0,False
