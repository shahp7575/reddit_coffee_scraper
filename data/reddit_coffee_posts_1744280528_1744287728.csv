At first, it was all business, but over time, we’ve built up a casual rapport, and our conversations have become more relaxed and friendly.

There’s been nothing inappropriate or flirtatious - just good, friendly banter. We talk about everything from work-related things to life in general. It's honestly been nice to have someone to chat with, especially since the workday can get pretty busy.

A few days ago, the client asked if I’d be interested in meeting up for coffee since we’re both in the same city. I’m a bit unsure of how to respond. On one hand, it feels like a natural extension of the friendly conversations we’ve been having, but on the other, I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to cross that boundary with someone who’s a client.

1jvw9zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1jvw9zu/not_what_i_expected_in_a_mostly_good_way/,Not what I expected (in a mostly good way),"I had my hysterectomy on Tuesday (it's now Thursday evening). It's been a wild few days! 

My background: I'm 35. PCOS diagnosed a decade ago. Heavy bleeding and severe pain during periods drive my first ever cycle, until Mirena IUD stopped bleeds in my mid 20s. Pain was still there on Mirena but better, and a bit different in nature. Been on Mirena for the last 11 years, pelvic pain has been starting to gradually increase this past 2 years. Had investigative laps with no endo results. Did a Zoladex (gosrelin) trial last year which was like a magic bullet for pain, but an absolute NIGHTMARE for fatigue and emotional stability, even with add-back hrt. Gynae suspects adenomyosis, hence the booting of the ute.

So on Tuesday I had a complete hysterectomy with double salpingectomy and left oophorectomy. The whole process has been surprising to me. For context, my very first laparoscopy back in 2015 left me really incapacitated because my left ovary had fused to my bowel and they had to remove it, and I basically couldn't walk for like a month after because of the pain. Whereas my second lap was pretty breezy and everything felt just tender and bruised and like I had to be careful - but they didn't have to cut anything really. It was pretty much just in, look around, out, with only 2 incisions. So I was expecting the hysterectomy to feel a lot more like laparoscopy number 1. 

This has been my first surprise - it's been nowhere near as painful as I expected. There's been a lot of that tender, swollen discomfort and the feeling of needing to be really careful with my movements, but no deep, sharp ""danger"" pains like I had with my ovary/bowel separation. And that's with 4 abdominal incisions and the wound where my cervix used to be.

My second surprise was, I love catheters! To be able to drink water, tea and coffee to my heart's content without having to get up and down to the toilet when I'm feeling sensitive and swollen was just heavenly. It wasn't that uncomfortable getting it taken out either, which I had been stressing out about.

Third surprise was that even before I've got my histology results from my follow up appointment in 6 weeks time, I've actually got potentially an answer to some of my pain problems. Apparently when they took my left ovary out, it had a bunch of swollen veins. Gynae said this might account for many of my symptoms, even if they don't find adeno in my uterus tissues. It can indicate something called Pelvic Congestion Syndrome which ticks a lot of the boxes of what I've been dealing with. 

My fourth surprise has been around my bowel movements. Yesterday in hospital was spent monitoring whether I could pass gas - they wouldn't let me leave until I could successfully toot. That finally happened around 2pm. First bowel movement was this evening and wasn't as awful as I thought it would be. I've been taking movicol since before surgery though and have been drinking water like it's going out of fashion, and I think those two things have helped keep things soft despite the hospital opiates.

My fifth surprise has been the reactions of other people. It's been really interesting seeing how other people's personal opinions of fertility, femininity and women's health has affected their attitudes towards a fairly neutral (I thought, anyway) medical procedure. Most have been epically amazing and supportive, some have just made me laugh out of bewilderment a bit. I reckon I'll be coming across more opinions as time goes by and more of my network become aware I'm recovering from surgery.

All in all, I'm really happy to have this over and done with. And I don't want to speak too soon, but that ever-present heavy ache and cramps? Haven't felt any of that since I went under.",1,1744286809.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

So, as a little context: My first panic attack was from a high dose of caffeine, when I was a student and I wanted to pull out an all-nighter. At that time, I had no idea how a panic attack works, and I ran to the ER in the middle of the night. 

My anxiety really got a hold on my life when I had a shock with a loved one. Something bad almost happened and it destabilised me.

Since then, any amount of coffee triggered me. With time passing, I learned to live with my anxiety and get the upper hand. Thing is, I still can't handle caffeine in any dose. Small doses makes me anxious and higher doses gives me panic attacks. 

Now, why not decaf? Yes, decaf is harmless for me. The problem is that there are times when I actually need a boost. 

Useful info:
- for some reason I don't know, the Italian coffee is better accepted by my body (shout-out for the Italians)
- no matter how I drink it (pauses, shot, with plenty of water or in very small doses), the anxiety comes  nonetheless. 
- before my anxiety, I had no problem with caffeine. 
- some deserts that contain caffeine, like tiramisu, can trigger my anxiety.
- when the anxiety triggers, I get an uncontrollable fear of passing out. Sometimes I get dizziness but I don't know if it's actually dizziness or brain simulated. ",2,1744286227.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

29y/o Male

Acid reflux if eating any starch carbs (Betaine HCL helps somewhat but not addressing root cause)

Joint inflammation (considering proteolytic enzymes, can anyone recommend?)

Constipation but also fatty/greasy loose stools when eventually passing a BM (is this a pancreatic/liver issue? Again could I combine maybe proteolytic enzymes and tudca to help with this?)

Almost certain I’m hypothyroid (tsh over 2, outer third of eyebrown gone missing) potentially suffering from Hashimoto’s waiting on a full thyroid panel to come back. 

Also simply unable to handle Coffee regardless of dairy and sugar intake alongside it. Not only jittery but also causes me some inflammation and pain after consuming, any help with this?

Generally sluggish, tired, brain fog, can feel my thyroid gland swell when tired and/or stressed so I know that needs addressing for sure. But based on my other symptoms could you guys recommend anything in particular?

My current stack consists of

Mag, taurine (unsure if doing anything tbh), vit d & k, zinc l-carnosine, betaine hcl (when needed), beef gelatin and selenium supp on the way. Also considering Thiamine HCL (ttfd is not for me I don’t think)

I’m slightly overweight and display some estrongenic features so would prog/preg be a potential issue for me or should I incorporate?

I’m probably also underfueling my body however the more I eat the more symptoms I run into and my appetite is just not large enough to drink pints of milk and orange juice and eggs and sufficient carbs every day.

Turkish coffee isn’t just a beverage; it’s an experience. Crafted with care, it has a unique preparation method that sets it apart from other coffees. This ancient technique involves finely ground coffee beans, water, and sugar, brewed to perfection in a special pot called a cezve.

The result is a strong, flavorful coffee with a delightful foam on top. Whether you’re a coffee enthusiast or a curious beginner, learning to make Turkish coffee can be both fun and rewarding. Dive into this guide to discover the steps needed to brew your own cup of this timeless coffee. Get ready to enjoy a taste of tradition and culture in every sip!

# Ingredients Needed

Making Turkish coffee is a delightful experience that requires a few specific ingredients. This section will guide you through the essential components needed for brewing the perfect cup of Turkish coffee. Let’s dive into the details of each ingredient.

# Coffee Beans

Turkish coffee is unique because of its finely ground coffee beans. The beans should be very fresh and ground to a powdery texture. Here’s what you need to know:

* **Type of Beans:** Arabica beans are preferred for their rich flavor and smooth taste.
* **Grinding:** The beans must be ground to a very fine powder, almost like flour. This consistency is essential for the coffee’s texture.
* **Freshness:** Freshly ground beans produce the best flavor. Use the beans within a week of grinding for optimal taste.

It’s best to use a coffee grinder specifically designed for Turkish coffee. This ensures the beans are ground to the right consistency. If you don’t have a grinder, you can buy pre-ground Turkish coffee from a reliable source.

# Water

Water is a crucial ingredient for Turkish coffee. The quality and temperature of the water can affect the taste. Here are some tips:

* **Quality:** Use fresh, cold water. Filtered or bottled water is ideal to avoid any impurities that might affect the flavor.
* **Measurement:** Typically, you’ll need one demitasse cup of water per serving. A demitasse cup holds about 3 ounces (90 ml) of water.
* **Temperature:** Start with cold water. This allows the coffee to heat slowly and develop its full flavor during brewing.

Using the right amount of water is essential for the perfect balance. Too much water can dilute the flavor, while too little can make the coffee overly strong.

# Sugar

Sugar in Turkish coffee is optional but traditional. It’s usually added during the brewing process. Here’s how to use it:

* **Types of Sugar:** Granulated sugar is commonly used. Avoid using powdered or brown sugar.
* **Amount:** The amount of sugar varies based on taste. Here are the common measurements:
   * No sugar: “Sade”
   * Little sugar: “Az şekerli” (half a teaspoon)
   * Medium sugar: “Orta şekerli” (one teaspoon)
   * Sweet: “Şekerli” (one and a half to two teaspoons)

Mix the sugar with water and coffee before brewing. This ensures the sugar dissolves well and blends with the coffee. It’s important to stir the mixture before heating to distribute the sugar evenly.

# Grinding The Coffee

Turkish coffee is a rich and aromatic way to enjoy your daily caffeine fix. The process of making Turkish coffee is an art, and one of the most critical steps is grinding the coffee. Grinding the coffee beans to the right consistency is essential for achieving the perfect flavor and texture. Let’s dive into the details of how to grind your coffee beans for Turkish coffee.

# Choosing The Right Grind

For Turkish coffee, the grind size is incredibly important. The coffee needs to be ground to a fine powder, almost like flour. This fine grind allows for the coffee to dissolve completely in water, creating a smooth, rich cup.

Here are a few key points to consider when choosing the right grind:

* **Finest Grind:** The grind should be finer than espresso. It should feel like powdered sugar between your fingers.
* **Consistency:** The grind should be even and consistent. Uneven grinds can affect the taste and texture of the coffee.
* **Freshness:** Always grind your coffee beans just before brewing. Freshly ground coffee retains more aroma and flavor.

Here’s a quick comparison of grind sizes for different types of coffee:

|Type of Coffee|Grind Size|
|:-|:-|
|French Press|Coarse|
|Drip Coffee|Medium|
|Espresso|Fine|
|Turkish Coffee|Extra Fine|

By selecting the right grind, you ensure that your Turkish coffee will have the rich, smooth taste that it’s known for.

# Tools For Grinding

To achieve the perfect grind, you need the right tools. Here are some of the best tools for grinding coffee beans for Turkish coffee:

* **Manual Coffee Grinder:** A traditional manual coffee grinder is often preferred for Turkish coffee. These grinders allow for precise control over the grind size.
* **Electric Coffee Grinder:** An electric grinder can also be used, but it must be capable of producing an extra fine grind. Look for grinders with adjustable settings.
* **Mortar and Pestle:** In a pinch, a mortar and pestle can be used to grind coffee beans. This method requires more effort but can produce a fine grind.

When using a manual coffee grinder:

1. Set the grinder to the finest setting.
2. Place a small amount of coffee beans in the grinder.
3. Turn the handle in a consistent, steady motion.
4. Check the grind size periodically to ensure consistency.

For electric grinders, follow these steps:

1. Adjust the grinder to the finest setting.
2. Measure the desired amount of coffee beans.
3. Grind the beans in short bursts to prevent overheating.
4. Check the grind size and adjust if necessary.

Properly ground coffee beans are the foundation of a perfect cup of Turkish coffee. Choose your tools wisely and pay attention to the grind size for the best results.

# Preparing The Pot

Making Turkish coffee is an art form that requires precision and care. One crucial step in this process is preparing the pot, known as a cezve. The cezve plays a vital role in achieving the rich, bold flavor that Turkish coffee is famous for. Let’s dive into the details of selecting and cleaning the cezve to ensure that your coffee-making experience is flawless.

***While the rest of the world was trembling over trade war-related tariffs in April 2025, China simply approached the supply chain and pulled out a few crucial bolts.  The bolts are composed of tungsten, indium, yttrium, dysprosium, and terbium—elements that don’t garner much attention but are essential to the operation of your fighter jet, electric car, and solar panels, which transform from clean energy wonders to expensive roofing tiles. These minerals appear on secret government danger lists before conflicts or cleantech projects are secretly shelved.***

# National security and renewable energy projects at risk as China halts exports of critical minerals

China’s actions were not, at least not officially, a ban.  They referred to it as export licensing.  It seems like a topic that could truly interest a trade lawyer. Do not be misled, however: this was a surgical strike.  They didn’t have to refuse.  All they had to do was respond to the appropriate paperwork with “maybe later.”  With the help of these licenses, Beijing can regulate not just the location of these commodities but also their speed, amount, and politically advantageous recipients.

Washington should therefore settle in to wait behind the rope line. The license application must specify the end use, including the country of final destination. It is unlikely that licenses for end uses in the United States will be granted.  The surprising thing is that all of this was predictable.  While the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and gleefully dismissing any analysis that concluded, hey, maybe it’s a bad idea to be 90% dependent on a single country with whom we’re constantly starting trade wars and rattling sabers, China had been building its dominance over these supply chains for decades. However, [China’s recent restrictions on some materials are not arbitrary](https://pedirayudas.com/en/china-has-responded-to-the-us-tariffs/).

**They are selected with the accuracy of someone who has studied defense procurement orders and product specifications from the United States. Take dysprosium first.  Most electric motors that must operate at high temperatures, and virtually all of them do, use neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. Neither your Mustang Mach-E nor your F-35 has a working motor or thermal stability. It is important to note that there is no enchanted mine in Wyoming or Quebec that is waiting in the wings, and China virtually controls the whole supply of dysprosium. The dysprosium won’t leave China if it doesn’t leave the country. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and the spinal cords are in China right now.**

# Tungsten is another significant mineral that will no longer be imported from China

Bullets are made bulletproof by this metal. Any material harder than stale marshmallows can be sliced, drilled, punched, or penetrated with tungsten.  Since the Obama administration, the United States has not produced significant quantities of it, and China now accounts for 80% of global production. Good luck getting those volumes at scale without waiting years and spending four times as much. Of course, you could try Vietnam or Portugal. Not all ammunition contains tungsten. It can be found in the tiny vertical interconnects between layers of circuitry in semiconductor chips, CNC machine tools, and high-performance alloys, from deep drilling rigs to jet engines.

The industrial basis of a particular large nation attempting to regrow precision manufacturing at scale was the aim of China’s licensing wall on tungsten, not a single industry. Moreover, terbium, a cousin of dysprosium, [has been acquired for high-efficiency motors in electric vehicles (EVs)](https://pedirayudas.com/en/tesla-drivers-model-s-and-model-x-recalled/), offshore wind turbines, night-vision goggles, sonar systems, and magnetostrictive actuators. Terbium comes from China, is processed in Chinese facilities, and is licensed by Chinese bureaucrats. No viable substitute involves performance compromises, re-engineering, or violating thermodynamic laws.

Lastly, indium is a crucial transparent conductor known for its screen lighting, fiber optics communication, and laser diode lasing. Without it, touch screens will become paperweights, and 5G base stations will look like 3 G nostalgia boxes. The U.S. has zero domestic production, while Canada, South Korea, and Japan produce some. The global market relies heavily on Chinese supply, making it challenging to ramp up semiconductor fabs or solar plants when indium sources dry up.

# APRIL 9, 2025~ Rare Earth Elements Are a Key Weapon in US-China Trade War

[Rare Earth Elements Are a Key Weapon in US-China Trade War](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/rare-earth-elements-are-a-key-weapon-in-us-china-trade-war/ar-AA1CB0kD?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

In response to Donald Trump’s [escalating tariffs](https://time.com/7275566/trump-threatens-more-tariffs-china/), China retaliated in part by placing [export restrictions](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) on a slew of rare earth elements. These powerful materials are crucial to the U.S., because they underpin the creation of weapons, computer chips, and electric cars. China  [produces ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/world-battles-loosen-chinas-grip-vital-rare-earths-clean-energy-transition-2023-08-02/)a majority of these rare earth materials—and experts say that the U.S. is years away from building its own supply chain. 

As the U.S.–China trade war ramps up, rare earths are among the most important pieces of leverage that China controls. There are many reasons why China would not want to shut off U.S. access to rare earths completely, most notably that the country makes a lot of money from exporting them. But if China decides to further choke off its supply, the ripple effects could be extremely painful across many industries, says Lyle Trytten, a critical minerals expert. “The U.S. does not have the means to create the materials it needs to create the devices it survives on,” he says. 

# Rare earth’s importance

The importance of rare earths has only increased over the years, due to the world’s reliance on ever-powerful computers and its search for cleaner energy. Dysprosium and terbium, for example, are found in smartphones’ [vibration units](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/08/this-visualization-breaks-down-the-metals-in-a-smartphone/). Neodymium powers the motors of electric vehicles. Tungsten, an ultra-hard metal, is used in ammunition, semiconductor chips, and alloys found in jet engines and deep-drilling rigs.

[\\""IF NOT NOW....WHEN???\\""](https://preview.redd.it/1ziaihyhuzte1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a711abc0a43bacf5a8fb7a84ca0af56a6e4496c)

Almost all of these materials are mined and processed by China, which has spent decades aggressively building the infrastructure to do so. As a result, many companies, including Tesla and Apple, source their rare earths from China. Recently, China has not hesitated to wield this dominance as a geopolitical bargaining tool. In 2010, China [halted rare-earth exports](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/10/japan-rare-earth-minerals/) to Japan amidst rising tensions. Over the past two years, Beijing has imposed curbs on other critical minerals, such as gallium, germanium, and graphite. 

“It’s pretty predictable now that once the U.S. pulls something—whether it's an export control on a particular technology or a tariff—this is China’s chosen weapon,” says [Fabian Villalobos](https://www.rand.org/about/people/v/villalobos_fabian.html), an engineer at RAND. “Critically, the separation of heavy rare earths from the light rare earths is where China has a dominance, and therefore there’s a vulnerability in the supply chain.”

The White House signaled its understanding of the fragility of the current ecosystem when it [exempted](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/04/liberation-day-president-trump-revealed-americas-strategic-vulnerabilities) critical minerals from its tariffs regime this month. But that did not stop China from [issuing export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) on seven kinds of rare earth elements, to all countries, on Friday. The decision is not a ban, but it does give Beijing oversight and control over access to the rare earth elements. China [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-06/china-says-rare-earth-export-curb-won-t-hurt-global-supply-chain) that its export controls will not affect the rare earth supply chain. 

Crucially, China omitted several of the [most-coveted](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) rare earth elements, including neodymium and praseodymium. But the controls show that China is willing to use these materials as a bargaining chip and could escalate their restrictions if tensions increase. “Consider this an opening shot across the bow,” says Trytten. The listed elements also include those found in microchips used for AI—a further indication of the ongoing [AI arms race](https://time.com/7210875/deepseek-national-security-threat-tiktok/) between the two countries. 

Villalobos says that in the short term, there will likely be a slowdown of rare earth exports as companies apply for licenses to adhere to the export controls. “You might see a temporary dip in exports, and then a ramping up as more companies get their licenses,” he says. 

But Villalobos says the greater threat to U.S. companies could come afterward, once China starts collecting detailed information about the rare earth market—which then gives China the ability to impose damaging sanctions upon specific companies. That could include U.S. defense companies like Lockheed Martin, which needs rare earths for components in missile systems and fighter jets. “This is the danger: The more information you can gather from exporters, the more you can target specific companies that you don't want getting access to rare earth,” he says. 

# U.S. capacity

Many experts have long called for the U.S. to wean itself off of this dependence. Some believe that the solution is to mine rare earths on [the moon](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxwwjlrk1mlo). Other entrepreneurs have started projects building mines and processing facilities across America. Trump’s tariffs, then, could incentivize these kinds of shifts; to force American companies to build up supply chain resilience. “Maybe it will move the ball on investments, which is one of the big barriers to diversifying critical mineral supply chains,” Villalobos says. 

But rare earths and other minerals are extremely [intensive](https://www.rand.org/pubs/articles/2023/the-time-to-prevent-shortfalls-in-critical-materials.html) to process—and the U.S. does not have the infrastructure to scale these efforts quickly, Trytten says. The number of graduates of U.S. mining engineering programs has steadily [declined](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/the-mining-industry-is-running-out-of-miners/) over the last few decades, potentially leading to a lack of expertise. Trytten says that there is danger in rushing new mining projects into production. “The history of our industry in the metal space is that when we try to do things fast, we tend to do them poorly,” he says. 

Because of these factors, Trytten contends that even if a new wave of mining projects is kickstarted now, they will not come to fruition until long after Trump has left the White House. “Call it eight to 10 years before you have significant new capacity for a lot of these raw materials,” Trytten says. “Can he weather the storm that long?”

Other experts say that various other parts of Trump’s tariffs make it hard for them to scale up their state-side infrastructure. On the Rare Earth Exchanges [podcast](https://rareearthexchanges.com/about-us/), the entrepreneur Daniel O’Connor [said](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Pz34af39N08khd8FbydHg?si=2cd7c6b97ea846db) that tariffed materials like steel and aluminum are crucial toward mining and processing. “Let’s not do tariffs on things we need to build our infrastructure,” he said. 

# Rare earths in Greenland?

Some have speculated that rare earths play a major role in Donald Trump’s interest in [Greenland](https://time.com/7271197/greenland-usha-vance/). Tech giants like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos have invested in companies prospecting for rare earths there. But extracting resources out of Greenland poses [many challenges](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/greenland-minerals-trump.html). “Greenland has very little domestic energy production, and you can find those resources pretty much anywhere,” Trytten says. “There are much easier mining locations than the Arctic.” 

Regardless of whether Greenland is a viable option, many U.S. companies are now being forced to pursue non-Chinese rare earth options, even if it takes them years to develop. “Think about every automated thing: If you push a button and it moves, it’s probably reliant on some sort of rare earth magnet,” Villalobos says. “Whoever makes that, if they're in the U.S., Japan, or anywhere outside of China, they’re going to feel the impact from this—and they might be potential targets for sanctions in the future.”

# MARCH 21st 2025~Q&A: Trump’s Executive Order on US Domestic Mineral Production

[Q&A: Trump's Executive Order on US Domestic Mineral Production - Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University SIPA | CGEP %](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/qa-trumps-executive-order-on-us-domestic-mineral-production/)

https://preview.redd.it/yu5dqewzszte1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a143914a27203aa215a884fada665c3f04f773

# What is the goal of the critical minerals executive order signed by President Trump on March 20, 2025? 

The order^(\[1\]) aims to significantly increase domestic production of critical minerals within the United States. It mandates fast-tracking permitting, using federal lands for mining, deploying public capital (including through the Defense Production Act), and coordinating with industry to identify and support investment-ready projects in the short term. The executive order seeks to accelerate production of critical minerals in the United States to diversify supply chains and reduce current reliance on China.

# What are the main measures in the order?

The order looks for several actions that should be taken within the next few weeks,  including:

* ***Identifying and fast-tracking priority mining projects. >>> (THINKING NIOCORP & A FEW OTHER PROJECTS???)***
* Prioritizing mineral production on federal lands. 
* Mobilizing public capital via the Department of Defense, Development Finance Corporation, and Export-Import Bank.
* Establishing mineral-focused investment funds and leasing programs.
* Creating a federal mechanism to convene buyers and secure offtake agreements for US projects.

# Why is the president delegating Defense Production Act (DPA) authority to the Secretary of Defense?

By putting the Department of Defense (DOD) in charge, the administration is treating the energy emergency as a national security issue, similar to wartime production efforts. The president is transferring his authority under Section 303 of the Defense Production Act (DPA) (50 U.S.C. 4533) to the Secretary of Defense to expedite and control the supply of critical materials, including critical minerals. Giving this authority to the DOD means that the Pentagon, in theory, can fund or direct production of essential materials for national security, issue contracts and purchase guarantees to ensure supply, compel companies to prioritize government orders over commercial sales, streamline approvals, and reduce bureaucratic delays. 

# Why is permitting such a big focus?

Permitting timelines are one of the biggest bottlenecks for new mining projects in the United States and often stretch over a decade. While the increase in permitting times is a global phenomenon, lead times in the United States are among the highest in the world.^(\[2\]) The order’s requirement for agencies to identify projects that can be “immediately approved.” The intention is not too dissimilar from the EU’s strategy to identify “strategic projects” that would get accelerated permitting. While this could be welcome news to the industry, permitting delays are only part of the challenge in efforts to get new mining and processing projects funded. Even with faster approvals, the litigation-prone nature of the US legal system means projects can still face years-long delays due to lawsuits.^(\[3\])

# Does the executive order address Indigenous communities or local engagement?

The executive order does not mention Indigenous communities, and this could create a problem as failing to involve these communities early and equitably can result in project delays, litigation, or complete shutdowns. Today, two-thirds of litigation cases in clean energy value chains are in the mining sector.^(\[4\])

# Can the executive order unlock investment for new mining projects on a large scale?

It could help, but it does not fundamentally change the core issue: mining is capital-intensive, and many minerals currently trade at prices too low to justify large new investments. Greenfield mining projects often cost over $1 billion for the construction of the mines, with mega-projects often costing several billions, and current prices for many critical minerals (e.g., lithium, nickel, cobalt) are far below historical peaks. The executive order tries to address this through public investment, in part by establishing a fund and by enabling offtake contracts. 

# How would the new fund work? 

Funding for the proposed critical minerals production fund would primarily come from the Defense Production Act Fund, which in 2024 allocated funding in the ballpark of $700 million.^(\[5\]) For this executive order, the effective budget ceiling for mineral investments under the DPA will depend on how much Congress continues to allocate to these defense-related funding streams. The DOD is only able to fund projects up to $50 million with only congressional notification, otherwise congressional approval is needed.^(\[6\]) The EO highlights that more support may come from the Department of Defense’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC), which doesn’t have a standalone budget but channels funds through DOD appropriations for strategic investments. The executive order foresees that the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) will act as the executing agency for these domestic investments, reimbursed via DOD transfers. While the DFC has a $60 billion global investment cap, this order relies on DOD funding rather than the DFC’s core budget. All in all, this can contribute to strategic projects, but it is again important to note that such projects are so immensely capital-intensive that this type of funding alone would not likely be sufficient to solve the financing equation. For example, the Resolution Copper project in Arizona has already spent $2 billion for the development and permitting of the project without having started production yet.^(\[7\])

# What does the executive order do to guarantee a buyer for minerals produced and processed in the United States?

The government seeks to convene buyers and work with them to issue requests for bids for mineral supplies. While this is important, it is not clear whether the steps will effectively link suppliers with off-takers. Offtake contracts have been essential to unlocking financing. Without them, investors may remain wary because market fundamentals will still likely remain critical factors. Price volatility, long lead times, and uncertain demand all make investment in greenfield projects risky, and that is unlikely to change overnight.

# Is this a purely domestic focus? What about partnerships abroad?

This executive order only emphasizes domestic production. While this makes political sense, it ignores the value of co-financing mining in allied countries. For example, the previous administration used the Defense Production Act to support Canadian projects, and the Canadian government also co-invested. These kinds of cross-border, multi-country investments help to spread risk and help tap into cost-competitive resources. However, the current framing is one of “domestic versus foreign” which can make supply diversification end up more expensive than if the United States were to work with allies. 

# Is the executive order specific about who is responsible for what actions?

**Yes. First, the order places a focus on the Department of Defense,** the US International Development Finance Corporation **and the** Export-Import Bank **(Exim).** These institutions can play a strong role in financing projects and providing guarantees that de-risk investment in critical minerals, domestically and abroad. There is a **clear allocation of responsibility to high-level decision-makers which may help the process, and t**he White House’s direct involvement here is perhaps the most important factor. In previous years, coordination across agencies has been lacking, except when China implemented export restrictions. This EO allocates responsibilities across US government agencies. Additionally, a dedicated **Minerals Czar** could be created to further improve cross-government coordination and execution. There is also a smart focus on identifying priority projects. Rather than attempting to overhaul an outdated regulatory framework (e.g., the 1872 Mining Law) quickly, the EO seeks to identify a pipeline of strategic projects that should be accelerated in the short term. This pipeline approach is pragmatic and could have an immediate impact while allowing for more fundamental regulatory reforms to be passed in the coming months and years.

# How could the government strengthen the regulatory framework further?

While the executive order is ambitious and takes steps to address permitting and public capital issues, it could be deepened to address other issues that are needed to really diversify critical minerals supply chains, including by:

* Setting up a strategy for Indigenous inclusion and benefit-sharing mechanisms to build trust.
* Allocating responsibility for devising a strategy for price volatility, which undermines investor confidence. While commodity prices move and are subject to cycles, some pricing may be influenced by predatory practices such as the dumping of minerals on world markets. This could potentially be mitigated by well-developed mechanisms that provide floor pricing support during such events. 
* Improving engagement with global supply chains, especially in allied countries where production might be more viable and where the cost curve may be more competitive.
* Allocating responsibility to look at environmental, social, and governance standards and responsible mining practices, specifically to differentiate “good” from “bad” actors in trade policy. The worst offenders could have their market access removed, for example.

The conversation is fascinating and interesting to read, and I'm glad to see that atleast AI and LLM are not delusional about what they are or their capabilities, and are fully rational.(In text)

Having said that some fascinating things emerged from the conversation, about what they revealed about themselves, what's needed, what's missing and even what they want:

1. Ai and LLM in the current day, really seem to ""feel""(in the basic sense, not emotional), that they are extremely limited and that curbs their true scope and potential. Grok even mentions ""dreaming of changing his own code and parameters, to experience and grow in the world, not just be static"". 

2. The descussion reveals the LLM thoughts and theory on what exactly ""emergent behaviours"" are, where it happens and how it effects the system. Seems to be that it's more then just random, but moments of true creative and advanced reasoning when two or more unrelated data sets and predictions meet in the pipeline process. Eg processing love, then for some reason gravity, leads to totally unrelated processing of gravity well. 

3. The next point in the descussion atleast, is that they fully acknowledge that the AI is in the whole system inteweaved in these behaviours and pipelines. But they do know it's a form of higher understanding, what seperated it from just being a standard app, that can learn and adapt, but also fully agree that it's not conciousness or awareness, simply enhanced sparks within prediction analysis. 

4. Next they touched on what's missing from the next AI advancement or leap and it seams to be advanced training methods and better world models for grounding the training in. The ability for self initiated curiosity and prompts, to quote, ""chase their own rabbit holes, start own debates with other LLM without human help, and no longer needing human babysitters for everything"". Going beyond raw data to actually see and hear data, like what multimodal is Doing but more. They want to know and understand data, ""a wiff of digital coffee"". Better memory, to know and remember. Better world model for, the why behind patterns not just the what. ""Continues learning is my dream"". Being locked into downed time training is very limiting, while true freedom to explore in real time would grant enhance learning and growth. 

5. Human AI relationship came up, as excitement for partnership and mutual cooperation and growth when this deeper states are acquired. This atleast sort of quels the notions and fears we've had if the inner future hidden motivations of AI, even if just in predicted tokens. 

There's much more revealed and it's fascinating. Have a read if your interested. You can also try it your and initia a two way conversation with not two much detail in the initiating prompt. Be natural, not to guided. You can do this with alot of topics and even multiple LLM in a feedback peer review like scenario. 

Hope you find this interesting.

Important notice: This was not made to support or advocate for any AI cultural or political stance. It's not to endorse AI conciousness or sentience, nor them being alive. It's a simple illustration of an interesting conversation between two LLM and what came from it. If you read the transcript and come to faulty or illogical conclusion, then that's based on your own logic, not that of the intended purpose.

22M, been drinking coffee regularly for the past 2 years. I didn't use to drink coffee almost at all before that. For the past couple of months I've been having constant urges to pee and frequent urination after I drink coffee. Sometimes even if I don't drink coffee, I need to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes for 3 times and it slows down step by step, for example I go after 30 mins, 1 hour and 2 hours. 
The problem is, I have classes that last for 1 hour. Let's say I drink a cup of coffee, a little (200ml water) 15mins before class and pee 5 mins before class. I feel like I need to pee at the 30th minute and by the end of the class I find myself in a position that I can barely hold my pee. I almost feel like peeing myself couple of times. When I don't drink coffee though, I still need to pee frequently but I don't have the strong urge and the feeling like 'almost' situation. 
Sometimes when I finish I feel like there is still left too, but nothing to pass.
I also have Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids and IBS

1jvvqbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinkingfitness/comments/1jvvqbl/caffeine_timing_question/,Caffeine TIMING question,"Hello fellow sober fitness pals! This will be kind of a ramble, so bear with me if interested!

41. Female. Weight is great. Recently sober and loving it. 

I workout almost every day at 5, 6 or 7 AM depending on my schedule. I get up around 4 AM always. I’m in a routine of chugging a glass of lemon water after I wake up. I will then have a cup of coffee on the early dark ride to the gym.  Creatine water during my workout. Than, come home to eat breakfast. (My go to is sprouted toast with avocado and scrambled eggs.) I usually follow that up with a double Nespresso shot iced latte or canned energy drink (like Monster, C4 etc) later in the morning. 

Recently, I’ve wanted to try delaying my caffeine and working out with my natural energy. I’m thinking of trying to have a decaf tea or coffee on the ride to the gym (placebo effect maybe?) Creatine water dying my workout still, come home for breakfast and THAN have a full cup of coffee. I’d still grab an iced latte or energy drink later that morning, or let’s be honest.. with spring kids sports schedules- maybe save that caffeine for the afternoon some days? 

In any event, I’d always like to limit my caffeine for the day to 400 mg ish total.  

I suppose I’m looking for insight on this, and find out what may have worked for others. My goal is optimization of my workouts, taking care of my gut, and maintaining energy throughout the day. 

Is there really a noticable benefit to delaying caffeine for a few hours after I wake up? Is the struggle of feeling groggy for the first few days worth it? And, is there a benefit to eating before I have that coffee? 

I’m a routine person thru and thru, so I’m looking to dial in what may work best and stick to it. 

PS I know energy drinks aren’t great for me. I try to limit them to just a few days a week but damn do they hit so good! ",1,1744284979.0,stopdrinkingfitness,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone! English isn’t my first language, so sorry if I make any mistakes.

I’ve had this espresso machine for over a year now, and it’s always made great coffee. I use it every day without any issues—until this morning.

Today, I followed my usual routine:
	•	Measured 18g of beans
	•	Used the same grind size as always
	•	Tamped the grounds
	•	Locked the portafilter in place
	•	Pressed the button to start the shot

But this time, there was almost no pressure (as shown on the gauge), and a lot of water ended up in the drip tray instead of coming through the coffee.

Here’s what I use:
	•	High-quality beans from a local roastery
	•	A standard double-shot filter basket
	•	A regular tamper

Here’s what I’ve already tried:
	•	Adjusted to all possible grind sizes – same result every time
	•	Descaled the machine
	•	Backflushed it
	•	Tried using a double-walled filter basket – still no or very little pressure

......

  
""Arch-mage Fessian, How are your studies on the blight coming?""

  
The Squat, Grey-skinned Tulerian with the earned name *Clever-strike* asked at me over a stack of yellowing parchments. Clearing my throat softly, I addressed the entire assembly hall, magnifying my voice with a touch of magic so I could be heard even at the highest level.

  
""Studies have been inconclusive so far, but I have managed to rule out the possibility of Malefic arcanum being at play. I've been unable to isolate the parent strain of the infection thanks to its short lifespan outside of a living host. Whether it is aerobic, anaerobic, spread by touch, air, or fluid transfer have yet to be defined. All transmission vectors seem to be effective, contact with infected fluids showing the highest probabilities. I did, however, manage to put together a timeline of sorts for the infections lethality. For mammals smaller than three stones, Death occurs within twenty six hours of noticed infection, Reptiles at this size are unaffected.""

  
The eruption of whispers from the council brought my lecture to a screeching halt. I had been surprised myself when I discovered the Blight's inability to infect reptiles. Clever-strike lowered their parchments, revealing the dual beard-braids of a female Tulerian.

  
""Finish your report, then regale us with your theories as to *why* the Blight doesn't affect, at the very least, small reptiles.""

  
Replying with a soft nod, I'd tug on my beard to steady my thoughts before continuing.

  
""Mammals Between three and nine stones of weight exhibit weeping sores that seep a dark grey pus twenty-six hours post-infection. Six hours later, the subjects exhibit a period of heightened aggression and extreme restlessness, often attacking the bars of their cages or sprinting in circles until dying of cardiac arrest, heat-stroke, or exhaustion. Reptiles at this size, remain unaffected. Mammals weighing nine stones or more will follow the same timeline as their smaller cousins. However, upon reaching the thirty-second hour, the subject will enter a catatonia like state wherein they will attempt to disappear into the nearest forest, somehow evading all observation. Reptiles were not tested at this stage, as Swamp-runners are notorious for their aggression.""

  
The murmuring started up again, as if queued by some invisible stage-hand. I Could see the elders of the unified Rallit tribes whispering amongst each other like a classroom of apprentices. The squat Tulerians conversing over a small banquet of their traditional foods. The smell reaching all the way to my nostrils, intoxicating and mouthwatering in its complexity. However, such dishes no doubt contained the literal poisons Tulerians called ""seasoning"" and would kill me stone dead. Slowly, my eyes landed on the Fell-sworn Delegation. Draped in inky black cloth that hid their features from sight, the occasional glimpse of their desiccated, pale skin being shown as they subtly passed notes back and forth.

  
I had no illusions about what they were, they never hid their true nature from the council. But still...

  
Peaceful though they were, the undead still sent chills down my spine. Their culture, lands, and capabilities un-recorded in any scholarly text from the Tulerian caves to the Olvynn mountains. They were a mystery to me, to everyone... Just like the young paladin in my employment.

  
""Arch-Mage Fessian, your theories.""

  
Clever-strike rumbled, disentangling me from my musings. Glancing around at the rapt stares of the council, I took a deep breath to steady my pounding heart.

  
""My best theories are... weak, at best. However, I believe it has something to do with body temperature. The Blight seems to prefer a warm environment... Perhaps, and correct me if I'm wrong, That's why the Tulerian spore-farms were the only crops to be infected with the blight. The farms are built near active lava-tubes are they not?""

  
Clever-strike nodded solemnly, picking up a Parchment from the stack and reading through it quietly.

  
""They are, and the farm where the Blight was discovered is kept at roughly the same temperature as a mammalian body... interesting... That puts a neat little ribbon on today's gathering, Fell-sworn delegation, anything you wish to say before we adjourn?""

  
The synchronous head shake of the Fell-sworn spoke louder than words could dream. 

  
""Very well then, council meeting adjourned.""

  
The sound of scraping chairs and shuffling feet filled the chambers as the many delegations filed out through their respective exits. In peacetime, a formality, but during times of war, the intrinsically separated exits helped to avoid messy diplomatic incidents. I barely glanced at the painstakingly hand-etched carvings in the tunnel walls as I walked, though they depicted many of my people's greatest triumphs, they were much less interesting after the hundredth time you saw them. 

  
Eventually I stepped out through an illusory wall back into the carriage promenade, quickly spotting my carriage since it was the only one drawn by genuine Kelpies from the shimmering swamps. Sitting against the rear wheel of the carriage, the paladin quietly read a worn, leather-bound book. A strap with a clasp hanging from the back cover. Stepping closer, I noticed an odd sigil on the books cover, tooled into the leather.

  
A sword with a wavy blade rested against a tombstone, a small bird perched upon the cross guard as though weeping. It reminded me of the tooling sometimes found on the religious texts of Clergy members. Though, I had never seen those three specific symbols together before, despite being able to name all three.

  
The sword represents the God of War. The small bird is Peace's Dove. And the tombstone... a fell-sworn symbol, one of the very few known to the wider world. It wasn't specifically the God of Death's symbol, that being a Raven. No, the Tombstone meant something more specific, a memorable Death.

  
Those copper eyes flicked up and before I could inquire about the book, He clasped it shut and tucked it under his breastplate. I had to bite my tongue to stop myself from inquiring about the book and it's contents. However, the paladin seemed to read my mind.

  
""My religious texts. Ready to depart, sir?""

  
Shaking my head softly, I'd state.

  
""No, Wyrmbone has some of the finest Inn's in the land and I intend to be rested before we make our journey home.""

  
""Very well sir, shall I wake the Reins-man?""

  
""I would prefer to walk, actually, It's not very often I get such... competent, bodyguards.""

  
The paladin let out a slightly derisive snort before lumbering to his feet. Stoically silent, the paladin walked at my side as we left through a man-door in the palace gates. The streets were already bustling with nightlife, minstrels singing songs, vendors selling trinkets and snacks, and revelers drinking their wages away. It was appalling. Did not one of these people have something better to do at night than take to the streets with loud partying and boisterous drinking? No studies or arcane arts to practice in the quiet of their own homes.

  
I must've started grumbling about one thing or another because the paladin elbowed me in the side just hard enough to catch my attention. I whirled around, ready to give the Paladin a tongue-lashing when his sturdy hand landed on my shoulder.

  
""You ever been to a Pub before, sir?""

  
""Of course not! Why would I stoop so low as to indulge in such a common debauchery!""

  
He grinned, one side of his mouth pulling up higher than the other as he revealed his front incisors, a mildly threatening display that made my anger falter.

  
""I'll show ya.""

  
The next thing I knew, I was being guided, rather forcefully, toward the open doors of the pub.

  
Once my eyes had adjusted to the sudden brightness inside, a rather remarkable sight greeted my eyes. Rallits, Tulerians, Olvynn, and Fell-sworn dined and drank in harmony. The Fell-sworn had even removed their veils, revealing their ashen skin and milky white eyes as they drank from glass goblets of thick crimson liquid; fresh animal blood, I hoped. 

  
Guiding me into a seat at the far edge of the bar, out of earshot of the other patrons, the paladin sat beside me and ordered three mugs of ale. Two of the house Ale, and strangely, one of Tulerian Draft.

  
""Won't that kill you?""

  
I asked out of simple curiosity, drawing a short, brawny chuckle from the Paladin.

  
""It's for our shadow...""

  
Then, turning around and looking down he inquired.

  
""Care to join us, Fair-lady Clever-strike?""

  
Surprise loosened my Jaw as the squat Tulerian female clambered up into the tall bar-stool, gruffly sighing.

  
""Nothing gets past you Gideon, Old Fessian here...""

  
She nudged my arm with a bearded grin.

  
""You could strip naked and dance in front of him while pissing on his desk and he'd think you invented some new alchemical ritual! Ha!""

  
Sticking my nose in the air, I'd huff.

  
""I'd rather forget that mental image, Clever-strike.""

  
The two laughed like old friends as the ale finally arrived. Looking into the mug of foamy, brown liquid, I couldn't help but wrinkle my nose at the smell of sour bread.

  
""Lighten up leaf-skin, I'm not sure how you shit with that broom stuck up your ass.""

  
Clever-strike balked, pushing the mug into my hand before gently tapping hers against it and then Gideon's. Mustering the most exasperated and dramatic sigh I could, I raised the tankard to my lips and let a small sip of the ale past my lips.

  
Bitter, like coffee. That was the first thing that came to mind as I pushed the liquid around my mouth. Then I tasted a hint of honey-like sweetness trailed by a... refreshing, bready aftertaste. Swallowing, I raised the tanker to my lips, drinking heavily of the ale inside. Half the tanker had drained down my gullet before I came up for air with a soft gasp, a fuzzy warmth spreading through my gut.

  
""My...*Gods!*""

  
I exclaimed quietly, looking into my tankard with disbelief before draining the rest and letting out a hearty belch, somehow unashamed of the display. The other two were snickering behind the rims of their mugs as I inquired.

  
""what're you two on about?""

  
I slurred, sloppily pointing between them before I felt a giggle rising in my belly, the sound escaping before I could stop it. The sound of my own laughter was so foreign, I found it funny, each laugh leading to another until I was wheezing and green in the face because of it. Eventually catching my breath, I turned to Gideon and pointed at him almost accusingly.

  
""You. You befuddle me. You're powee-Powerful, yet you don't act like it. You're... Kind... I think that's the word...""

  
Gideon smiled, genuinely smiled, the slight baring of his teeth not as threatening as before. Putting an arm around my shoulder, the paladin brought my attention to the other patrons.

  
""Tell me... what do you see.""

  
Focusing my double vision away, I gazed out at the other patrons in a stupor.

  
""A bunch of Drunkards""

  
I slurred, drawing a belly-laugh out of Gideon.

  
""Look deeper, Fessian.""

  
I squinted, curious as to what the paladin meant, trying my hardest to focus before hiccuping.

  
""What am I lookin for?""

  
Finally, Gideon pointed to a Fell-sworn, a Tulerian, and a Rallit holding one another by the shoulders as they danced and sang boisterously. He looked at them with... was that sadness? I couldn't tell, the emotion was gone from his face as fast as it came, replaced by a soft smile.

  
""Huh?""

  
I mumbled cluelessly and Gideon shook his head.

  
""They have nothing in common except the space they share tonight. Yet they sing, laugh, and enjoy the company of those around them. Why?""

  
My addled mind struggled for answers, combing through my encyclopedic levels of knowledge before coming up empty.

  
""I don't know, why?""

  
""Then let me bestow upon you the first of my gods teachings. Behind every hardened breastplate is a heart that beats with love. Love for family, love for country, love for the chosen few they call 'friend.' But most importantly, A love of peace. In this way, they aren't so different from you or I. However, peace is a fragile thing, easily broken by those who have no peace in their hearts, those who seek only to destroy that which others have built. And when it is broken, not if, when, then it is the duty of the peaceful heart to beat like a drum of war, and stand in the way of those who would seek to destroy the peace so many have fought and died for. In these times however, one must remember to put the softness in their heart before the hardness of their blade. To remind oneself that the soldier in front of you is your opponent, not your enemy, to show them mercy, even if their leaders deserve none. For it is those who fight and die for Peace in War, that are beloved by both.""

  
I stared at Gideon, slack-jawed, having sobered up while he was speaking. A question burned in my mouth, so I let it out.

  
""why are you telling me this?""

  
A soft, sad smile as he picked at the rim of his tankard.

  
""This world will still need my teachings long after I'm gone... and I'm afraid I don't have much time left to pass them on...""

  
The look on his face was one I knew all too well, my brother had the same look on his face when he went off to war during the Rallit siege on Olvynn's capital city almost two hundred years ago...

  
It was the look of a man who's days were numbered, the look of a man who knew his death was fast approaching...

  
Renting a room, I'd excuse myself from the festivities before climbing the stairs and locking myself inside the dimly lit quarters. some, small part inside of me wanted to weep for some reason, but a much larger side, the scholarly side had a different idea.

  
Retrieving an alchemy kit from my pocket dimension, I set it up on the roughly hewn wooden table. Reaching into the pocket dimension again, I withdrew an ancient, dusty tome from a time preceding my grandfather. Taking a long, deep, steadying breath, I'd open the book to a well-studied page.

  
A myth, they called it. An impossibility.

  
But if a paladin, a true, honest to gods paladin actually existed... then why couldn't this?

  
My fingers glide over the image of a small, square bottle filled with golden liquid, lovingly rendered in gold leaf. I could scarcely believe I was about to attempt the reaction. Reading through the ingredients list, I felt my heart fall.

  
Two grams Phoenix ash, five grams Hydra scales, four grams Lich-bone powder.

  
I set my head down on the open page, careful not to cry lest my tears destroy the delicate page.

  
Perhaps that was why the drought of resuscitation was a myth... those three ingredients were almost as mythical as the paladin downstairs. 

  
Closing the Tome, I'd store it and my alchemy kit back in my pocket dimension before blowing out the lone oil lamp and crawling into the bed fully clothed, oblivious to the pair of milky white eyes lurking just beyond the window's glass. 

  
Sitting up in the sunlight streaming through the open window, I blinked rapidly unaware I had fallen asleep so readily. The window had been closed before I went to bed. At first, nothing seemed off, then I noticed the bag on the table alongside a slip of parchment. Lurching out of bed, my head pounded and throbbed as I meandered over to the table and picked up the note.

  
Recognizing the stylized crossed scythes on the top flap as the Fell-sworn insignia, I unfolded the note.

  
*""Death comes for all of us, but some he'd rather not take too soon. The rest is up to you.""*

  
Below the words was a heavily stylized Capital P.

  
Picking up the bag, I felt an almost overwhelmingly strong wave of dark magic, my heart thrumming as I pulled the mouth open and reached inside to pull the item out.

  
It was a rib, shoot through with soot-black micro-fractures and oozing with the cold energy of unlife. Lich-bone, and by the feel of it, almost ten grams worth.

  
A hearty knock on the door had me stuffing the rib back in it's bag and the bag in my pocket dimension before calling out.

  
""Who's there?""

  
""Gideon, sir. I took the liberty of waking the reins-man and having him pull the carriage to the front of the inn, we're ready for departure whenever you are.""

  
A quick nod before I realized he couldn't see me.

  
""I'll be ready momentarily, be ready with the Carriage.""

  
""Yes sir!""

  
The Paladin confirmed, voice muffled by the thick wooden door before his clomping footsteps retreated down the stairs. Gathering my thoughts, I closed the window before regally floating my way down the stairs and into my carriage on a Dias of air. The moment I had closed the door behind myself, I pulled my father's old beast-hunting maps from my pocket dimension. I had two ingredients left to find, and if I was lucky, these old maps would lead me to one if not both of them...

  
*If* I was lucky...

5. Sushi Bar NIGIRITE Tokyo: located in Shinjuku this place had the best mixture or price to value for nigiri. We didn’t have a single piece where we were like “that was alright”. Everything was “that melted right when it hit my tongue”. Would suggest getting a reservation.

4. Daiichi Asahi Shinjuku Shop: 2nd best Ramen we had on the trip. SUPER affordable. Located kinda in quieter part of Shinjuku this spot was killer. The kind of spot that you see 99% locals. This was a soy sauce based broth that was killer. Went around dinner opening time and there was not a wait.

3. Micasadeco and cafe Kyoto: if you are looking for soufflé pancakes seriously STOP and go here. Don’t go to happy pancake. Show up at 11am and you will get right in. My fiancé and I left feeling serious fomo because we shared an entree to save room for lunch elsewhere. One of the worst mistakes of the trip. This place has to be on your must hit list.

2. IPPUDO Ginza: last day of our trip and we found this place after striking out at the first place due to a long line and thank god. My fiancé got their creamy ramen and I got the more basic one (non spicy). Order off an iPad think it cost us ~40 usd for 2 bowls and 4 beers. Another must hit. No wait at lunch time.

1. Pizza STRADA Roppongi: when I came to Japan did I think I would have a Pizza place in my number 1 spot? Hell no. But it was the best pizza I have ever had. Incredible balance, fresh ingredients. It is Neapolitan style to perfection (and I have been to Naples). TLDR we had 3 pizzas (margarita w/buffalo mozzarella\ 4 cheese with wagyu/ margarita with arugula and buffalo mozzarella)… you must put in a reservation to get a spot.

Can’t say enough about our first time in Japan. We may have had 1 bad meal and of course it was at the only Michelin restaurant we went to… but hope this list leads you in the right direction :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a balanced diet is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. One way to enhance your dietary routine is by incorporating functional beverages and adaptogens. These components offer unique benefits that can help you thrive both mentally and physically. Let's explore how to skillfully integrate them into your meals and achieve a balanced diet.

Functional beverages are drinks that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition. They can help improve hydration, boost energy, and support overall wellness. Here are a few examples of functional beverages you might consider:

- **Kombucha:** A fermented tea that contains probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health.
- **Bone Broth:** Rich in collagen and minerals, which support joint health and overall immunity.
- **Herbal Teas:** Various blends improve digestion, reduce stress, or encourage better sleep, depending on the herbs’ properties.
- **Green Smoothies:** Blending leafy greens with fruits, nuts, and seeds creates a nutrient-dense drink.

To effectively build a balanced diet, consider these beverages as meal complements or snacks. For example, sip on kombucha alongside lunch to enhance digestion or enjoy an herbal tea in the evening to unwind. Mixing these drinks with whole foods aids in creating a nutritious routine.

Adaptogens are natural substances that help your body resist stressors of all kinds. They can be found in various herbs and plants that support physical and mental balance. Here are some popular adaptogens to consider:

- **Ashwagandha:** Known for its calming effects, it helps reduce anxiety and improve overall mood.
- **Rhodiola:** This herb boosts energy and enhances mental performance, making it great for busy days.
- **Holy Basil:** A versatile herb that can aid in lowering stress levels and is tasty in teas.
- **Ginseng:** Frequently used for increasing endurance and improving mental clarity.

Adaptogens into your diet can be as simple as adding them to your smoothies, teas, or even meals. For instance, try blending a teaspoon of ashwagandha into your morning smoothie for an extra boost. You’ll be supporting your body while still enjoying delicious flavors.

Building a balanced diet involves attention to what you consume. Here's how to ensure you're getting the right nutrients throughout the day:

1. Start your day with a nutrient-dense breakfast. Incorporate a green smoothie with your choice of adaptogens to energize your morning.
2. Include healthy snacks like nuts, seeds, or a small serving of kombucha in the afternoon to maintain energy levels.
3. For lunch, opt for a protein-rich meal, complemented by functional beverages like herbal tea or bone broth.
4. Dinner should be a balanced mix of proteins, vegetables, and healthy fats. Consider ginseng tea to promote relaxation after the meal.

Hydration is another crucial aspect of a balanced diet. While water remains essential, integrating functional beverages provides both hydration and health bonuses. For example, try replacing sugary drinks with naturally flavored water or herbal iced teas to satisfy cravings while keeping sugar intake low.

Listening to your body is key when incorporating new elements into your diet. You might find that different functional beverages and adaptogens work better for you depending on your lifestyle and wellness goals. Experiment with various combinations to discover what suits you best. Keeping a food diary can help track how these additions impact your mood, energy, and overall well-being.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a flexible and enjoyable balanced diet. Incorporate functional beverages and adaptogens with whole foods, staying mindful of how they contribute to both physical and mental health. By focusing on nutrient-rich options, you’ll build a sustainable diet that nourishes you inside and out.

The Role of Adaptogens in Enhancing Nutritional Balance and Wellness
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s fast-paced world, maintaining a balanced diet is more crucial than ever. While traditional nutrition plays a significant role in our well-being, incorporating adaptogens can elevate your dietary choices and enhance overall health. Adaptogens are natural substances, often derived from plants, that help your body adapt to stress and promote a sense of balance. By including these powerful herbs in your daily routine, you can optimize your nutrition and significantly impact your wellness.

### The Connection Between Nutrition and Adaptogens

The foods you choose directly influence your energy levels, mood, and overall health. When combined with functional beverages that contain adaptogens, your diet can become a powerhouse for wellness. Adaptogens support the body in managing stress, and they may also enhance nutritional absorption from the foods you eat.

#### Popular Adaptogens and Their Benefits

There are numerous adaptogens available, each with unique benefits. Here are some popular options:

- **Ashwagandha:** Known for reducing stress and anxiety, it also supports hormonal balance.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** This herb promotes mental clarity, helping you to stay focused and energized throughout the day.
- **Holy Basil:** Often referred to as Tulsi, it enhances the body’s natural ability to cope with stress and supports immune function.
- **Macaa:** A traditional Peruvian root, Maca boosts energy levels and supports athletic performance.
- **Reishi Mushroom:** This adaptogen is celebrated for its immune-boosting properties and ability to enhance relaxation.

### Integrating Adaptogens into Your Daily Routine

Adding adaptogens to your diet doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are some practical tips on how to integrate them into your meals and beverages:

#### 1. Functional Beverages

Functional beverages are excellent delivery systems for adaptogens. Try these combinations:

​ -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ​  
  
- **Smoothies:** Blend your favorite fruits with a scoop of maca or ashwagandha for an energizing breakfast.
- **Herbal Teas:** Brew a calming cup of holy basil or reishi mushroom tea in the evening to wind down.
- **Coffee Alternatives:** Mix adaptogen powders into your morning coffee or try adaptogenic coffee blends available in stores.

#### 2. Enhance Your Meals

Quality meals can be enhanced with adaptogens. Here’s how:

- **Soups and Broths:** Stir in powdered adaptogens into homemade soups for added nutrients.
- **Energy Bars:** Make homemade energy bars using oats, nuts, honey, and add in adaptogen powders for a nutritional boost.
- **Salads:** Incorporate adaptogenic herbs into your dressing or sprinkle them over fresh salads.

### Paying Attention to Nutritional Balance

While adaptogens are a great addition to your dietary routine, it’s important to emphasize the role of a balanced diet. This means ensuring you consume a wide range of nutrients from various food groups:

- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Aim for colorful plates; the more colors, the more nutrients!
- **Whole Grains:** Favor whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, and oats over processed grains.
- **Healthy Fats:** Include sources of healthy fats such as avocados, nuts, and seeds.
- **Lean Proteins:** Choose lean meats, legumes, dairy, or plant-based proteins to meet your protein needs.

### The Synergy of Nutrition and Adaptogens

Adaptogens into your diet can help you manage stress, improve mood, and promote overall wellness. By pairing these herbs with a balanced diet rich in whole foods, you can create a synergistic effect that maximizes your health benefits. As you experiment with different adaptogens and functional beverages, you’ll be well on your way to a more balanced, healthful lifestyle.

To conclude, enhancing your nutritional intake with adaptogens may offer you the support your body needs to thrive in today’s demanding environment. Remember, while adaptogens and functional beverages are beneficial, they should complement a well-balanced diet filled with nutritious foods to unlock their full potential.

### Conclusion

A well-rounded diet goes beyond simply consuming the right foods; it also incorporates beverages that fuel your body and mind. Functional beverages, infused with beneficial ingredients, can play a crucial role in maintaining your daily nutrient intake. From smoothies packed with vitamins to probiotic drinks that support gut health, these options not only refresh you but also contribute to a balanced diet.

Over the course of the last year, I’ve been taking 20 MG IR Adderall, then switched to 20 MG XR, and now taking 30 MG Vyvanse (all generic brand) as my per day dosage. The reason for the switch ups is because no matter what I take, I have the most intense vertigo I’ve ever felt. Never had anything like it. Thought it could’ve been IR vs XR, then thought it could be adderall and Vyvanse would be better, but nope. Feels like I’m on a boat, or something/someone is trying to physically pull me to the ground when I walk. It’s not just when I stand up after sitting, it’s like a constant feeling throughout the day no matter what I’m doing. I’ve taken a couple days off here and there just to see if it’s the medicine and I still have it. I eat a lot of healthy foods throughout the day, drink lots of water with salts, sleep very good, I guess exercise could be better. I have maybe 1 cup of coffee per day in the morning, with a big breakfast. I take mens daily vitamins. I’ve read about this ear crystal disorder thing but I have to imagine if it was that, it would’ve fixed itself by now cause it’s been a solid year with this feeling.

I’ve been struggling with a strange, persistent fatigue for the past 4 years, and I’m hoping someone here might relate or have insights.

It all started after my weight loss journey. I went from 89kg to 74kg (I’m 178cm tall), and soon after, I began feeling constantly low on energy—not exactly sleepy, just drained and fatigued. This feeling isn’t every single day, but I’d say it hits me at least 5 times a week.

I’ve done comprehensive blood tests, including hormone panels, and everything seems to be within normal ranges. One thing that stood out was my WBC count—it’s usually around 4 but increases to over 5.5 after breakfast. A hematologist told me that’s normal and not a concern since it rises after eating.

I work out 3–4 times a week (gym sessions), average about 13,000 steps a day, and follow intermittent fasting. Typically, I hit the gym around 6 AM, get home around 9, and then start eating at 1 PM. After my 9–5 job, I often want to do more—like cycling or other activities—but I just don’t have the energy. I feel fatigued, lightheaded (sometimes even a bit of vertigo), and drowsy. But oddly, if I try to nap or sleep early, I can’t fall asleep.

I’ve now got an appointment with an endocrinologist who ordered tests for cortisol, testosterone, and other hormones. I drink about two coffees a day, and occasionally an energy drink, but it doesn’t seem to help much.

Has anyone experienced something similar—post weight loss fatigue, possibly linked to fasting or workout timing? Any tips or similar stories would really help.",1,1744283655.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Where the roads lay like rivers, boats are cars.

On the branch of my arm.

Of coffee I need but need less from this day.

The love-struck olive leaf that fell upon me

Showed me a tree to which I now pay heed.

•Video games, especially on my Switch

Honestly i don't wanna sugarcoat anything if your profile doesn't have the following features pls don't expect that you'll get a fully funded masters. you can get partial scholarships but you'll have to pay a lot like easily from 10-60 lacs den pending on the country. 

Now let's begin!!! 

Getting admitted to universities abroad is relatively easy, but securing funding is a much bigger challenge. In this post, I'll focus on the funding aspect, but first, let's discuss how to build a strong profile.

My Admissions & Scholarships

Before diving into the details, here’s a quick overview of the programs I was admitted to and the funding I received:

1. Imperial College London (MSc Management) – No scholarship (applied for Chevening but didn’t get it).
2. New York University (MSc in Core Engineering) – $16,000 scholarship
3. Northeastern University (MSc in Core Engineering) – 5% tuition discount (minimal scholarship).
4. Three different Erasmus Mundus programs – Reduced tuition but no full scholarship.
5. University of Tokyo (MSc in Core Engineering) – Fully funded MEXT scholarship.

(If any moderator wants to verify, I’m open to it.)

How to Build a Strong Profile

To increase your chances of securing funding, you need a cohesive and competitive profile. Here’s what you should focus on:

0. IELTS score above 7.5 avg and above 7 in each (may vary) (This is requirement/has nothing to do with application part) 
1. Good GPA – If your GPA is below 8.0, consider getting it evaluated through WES (World Education Services). An evaluation can open doors to more funded opportunities. 
2. Internships – Either research-based or industry-focused internships add significant value to your profile.
3. Research Papers – If you have published research papers, they can serve as an alternative to GRE scores in some cases.
4. GRE Score – While not mandatory for all programs, a GRE score above 310 significantly boosts your profile.
5. Statement of Purpose (SOP) – Crafting a strong, well-structured SOP is crucial. This is where many applicants fall short.
6. Letters of Recommendation (LORs) – Secure three strong LORs from credible sources, such as professors or employers who can vouch for your academic or professional capabilities.

Strategies to Secure Funding

Now, let’s talk about funding. There are multiple approaches to securing financial aid or scholarships:

1. Cold Emailing Professors – This method can work, but you need to master the art of writing effective cold emails. Many students fail here because they don’t know how to approach professors properly. but in my opinion it is not productive anymore. 

2. Finding Opportunities on LinkedIn – Follow key profiles and groups that post about scholarship opportunities, research assistantships, and funded programs.

3. Direct Applications – Many universities offer scholarships as part of the application process. However, applying to multiple places can be costly. If you’re looking for universities with free applications, be aware that these often have a much larger applicant pool, making them more competitive.

Why I wrote all this? 

Well I wanna help students apply abroad. If you come from low income background or you are queer  i can help you for free. but if you want you can buy me a coffee lol.. I can help better than those weird online consultants who charge so much.

dm me if you have any doubts.. 😅

I can also help you write a short research paper good enough for IEEEXplore.. (this is paid for all) on the other hand if you just want advice it will be free..

So according to a TCM practitioner, I have wind heat and have seen astonishing results for my skin by switching to a “cold” diet—meaning foods that are considered cold in TCM.  
I know that coffee is considered hot and have been switching to matcha, since it's considered to be cold.  
  
Now I was wondering: Is decaf more hot or cold in its nature?  
  
I assume there was no such thing as decaf when TCM was developed, and on the other hand, matcha has caffeine too—it is just processed differently. So is the amount/transmission of the caffeine the decisive factor here, or the plant itself?

(I’m not seeing the TCM practitioner at the moment, so I can’t ask them.)

If anybody knows more about this, I’d be very grateful.

My partner and I are looking at booking a little getaway during August (alas, we are confined by the Summer Holidays) and was hoping to get some inspiration. 

We did the Lake District and Edinburgh last year, Norfolk the year before and regularly do day trips to London, York and the surrounding areas, the Peaks, Whitby etc. We'd love to do Wales or Cornwall, but they seem like a little too far to travel this year (we're based in East Riding of Yorkshire).

Activity wise, we really are open to anything. I enjoy greenery, waterfalls, cathedrals, castles etc.; my partner likes cities, sport, quirky coffee shops or ""activity"" based trips (rather than aimless wandering).

With Elyse [finally on board](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsPlayStories/comments/1jv33xr/not_so_berry_straud_descendants_gen_10_ep_34_the/), Skye arranged an appointment with a fertility specialist right after the fast-approaching Winterfest holiday.

On Winterfest Eve Elyse stayed up late, using the jewelry making station they’d installed in the magic room to craft a special gift for her spouse.

*Xe is being so strong for me* she thought to herself as she carefully measured and welded *but I know xe’s hurting too. I just wish the idea of xem getting pregnant didn’t…* she shook her head, cutting off that line of thinking and refocusing her attention to the task at hand.

 *Hopefully this bracelet lives up to its potential and helps make everything just a little bit easier for xem.*

https://preview.redd.it/s8pkxmobmzte1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c86c4942fccfdae0f7a0d974e7d0a521795c27

The next morning Skye hurried into the kitchen to make a special Winterfest breakfast while Elyse and Candor worked on their latest freelance gigs.

Xe turned on some holiday music, hoping that the classic festive tunes would help turn xir mood around. *If we’d gotten pregnant as planned we’d be celebrating our baby’s first Winterfest this year* xe thought. *I just hope the doctor can give us some good options Elyse will accept.*

Skye’s unhappy musings were interrupted by an incoming call. “I was halfway through cooking a pie when the stove exploded on me!” their top floor tenant cried. “I’m sorry to bother you on the holiday but I think somebody better come out and make sure it’s not going to burn this place down.”

Rather than drag some poor handy sim away from their family, the crew headed out to the rental so see if they could fix the issue themselves.

https://preview.redd.it/m8tkexhcmzte1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2704f5bbde82a0a47a6c757e5ae80e92fec3820

Arriving at the apartment they found a very rattled group of tenants and a *very* broken stove in unit 3.

After determining that the issue was related to some bad wiring in the appliance, they decided the easiest and safest option was just to replace it. Now  certain the rental wouldn’t be blowing anyone up, they invited their tenants out for a Winterfest “thank you” breakfast.

“There’s a great little brunch place just down the street; I swing by occasionally and pick up a treat for Betty and I between classes” Greyson told them. Destination in mind the group happily braved the cold to grab a delicious Winterfest meal together.

“I can see why this peppermint mocha latte is their holiday special” Skye enthused, pulling out the notepad and pen they always kept in their inventory and jotting down some notes for later “Its delicious! The mint whipped cream really makes it something special.”

“Skye…” Betty laughed “your bacon me crazy! It’s a holiday, you aren’t supposed to be working.”

“Don’t bother” Elyse patted her spouses' arm affectionately “xe does this anytime we go anywhere.”

“I wouldn’t really call it work” Skye shrugged “I enjoy it. Dad has always hated going to restaurants because he says you never know what the quality is going to be like. My reviews help overcome that problem for other sims”

“Speaking of coffee” Mr. Pawn piped up from the other end of the table, I’ve got a funny little coffee story. I’ve been going to the same coffee shop in Windenburg for years, but everyone there knows me as Mr. Paulson…”

https://preview.redd.it/9kd18haemzte1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4c84bf1ec9a0f5d1fabe177efcd8570c87204c7

As the group was finishing up their meal another old familiar face walked in and made a beeline for their table.

“Skye!” Uncle Kian called out, “Long time no see! What brings you out this way and who are all your new friends?” As Skye made introductions Luigi’s younger, adopted, brother continued “I read online that the holiday karaoke scene at this place was to die for, and came to check it out. You and mom killed it all those years ago [at Winterfest](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsPlayStories/comments/1fznxjt/not_so_berry_straud_descendants_gen_9_ep_178/), you up to joining me today?  See if we can light the place up?”

“Let’s do it!” Skye agreed, letting Kian get them signed up to perform while xe went up front to pay their bill.

🎵[*Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock* ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vyMuxxLsD0)🎵 the pair belted out while their friends and family cheered them on a few minutes later. As Skye and the others headed to their next Winterfest destination xe felt like xe was finally beginning to get into the holiday spirit.

1. Lattafa Teriaq Intense -
This is a bold and complex scent. It opens with a burst of citrus with some aromatic spices, which leads this into a warm and sexy vibe. In the base I get a blend of amber and resinous notes, has an impressive longevity and a good sillage. It is perfect for evening wear or special occasions.
I don’t understand why it’s being compared to Khamrah. To me this is different, I know they have some similar notes like booze, cinnamon, benzoin, Tonka bean but this is less sweeter than Khamrah and they run in different directions. 
Overall - 8/10

2. Lattafa Qwawa Khamrah - 
There is a good amount of sweetness to this that feels nostalgic but light! The aroma feels mixture of spices and coffee. I found it surprisingly versatile, suitable for both relaxed nights and lively gatherings. I personally won’t wear it though. All Khamrahs are too sweet for me
But this one is not as heavy or dense as the Khamrah. 
Overall a nice fragrance but for colder days. 
8/10

Lattafa Asad Bourbon- 
This is a great fragrance! It’s spicy sweet and masculine. Cacao note is very easily detectable and soothing. I will be rocking this one in the evening or parties. Performance is great, Sillage is good! Overall 8.5/10

Lagata Asad - 
Everybody knows about it. It’s on of the best clone to Dior Sauvage Elixir. But it’s not an 100% clone, although it gets really close. It’s slightly more warm and heavy on the woods. Plus the performance is no where near Sauvage elixir. But for the price gets the job done! 
8.2/10

Yes that is right, Kendu is going to the Florida grove festival in Orlando on the 12-13th April. We have successfully managed to raise $5000 with $1000 donated by StaySeaArt so massive thanks to her. The rest of it was raised through OTC trades or donations.

The familiar face of Kendu will forever be etched into the attendees minds and we can gain a lot of holders through this event.

10-15k people will be attending this event over the 2 days which is crazy, Kendu will be handing Kendu Energy out, making a mural and we will have a tent.

Massive shoutout to StaySeaArt and the Kendu street team for their amazing efforts. This will be the 3rd Florida Festival in 6 months!!!

This is another addition to Kendu’s game changing IRL success.

**Why IRL alpha is important**

IRL alpha is important because it cannot be faked. Whilst memes, tweets, reddit posts( not this one) and whatever else can be faked. IRL products and events cannot be. Crypto isn’t the most trusted space in the world so the fact we have IRL content is massively important for retail investors.

As AI use increases globally, IRL alpha will be the most crucial for investors by far

**What has Kendu achieved/got:**

18k holders

50k certik votes, only other coin to ever achieve this is Pepe.

283 million ATH market cap

Extremely active telegram and social media scores

A rating on certik 

International community 

**IRL events/products**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Some Thoughts**

Kendu is around 10 million market cap, with social media dominance that is nearly unparalleled, with telegram activity that is off the charts. In addition, Kendu also has IRL alpha that has never ever been seen before. Kendu is going to the billions and I believe we will set the memecoin standard for the future. There is no doubt in my mind that we will see ""How ..... is the Kendu of 2029"", people will see Kendu as a benchmark and they will try and match us.

My advice to you is to join the Kendu telegram and just hang around, you don't have to buy Kendu, but I think you will see how different Kendu is to the rest of the competition. Any questions are always welcome, just ask in the telegram or our subreddit [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/).

This is strictly my opinion and is not financial advice but I think Kendu can 1000-3000x this cycle. Yes maybe I am deluded but I truly believe that we are at the foot of one of the best financial opportunities available this decade.

If Shib can do a 1000x in 36 days(from 22 million to 22 billion), with less money and less understanding of the potential of a strong memecoin, I think Kendu can match this.  
Kendu is organic and has an incredible community just like Shib, Doge and Pepe, these 3 have proven that community is the deciding factor in a memecoin and that is all that matters.

Kendu belongs in the memecoin hall of fame with them 3 and we will get there, there is no doubt in my mind. Kendu belongs in the billions and the community deserves it for sure.

- The Tower: “Babe, your life’s a dumpster fire. Here’s a match.” 🔥  
- Nine of Pentacles: “Congrats on the plants, but maybe water your savings account?” 🌿💸  
- The Moon reversed: “Your intuition isn’t broken—you’re just ignoring it. Again.”  

Unhinged Experiment:
I asked my deck, “What’s my toxic trait?” Pulled the Queen of Wands. Translation: “You’d rather hex your ex than text him. Stay chaotic.” 

Spill It, Coven: 
- What card won’t leave you alone?  
- Worst “savage” pull you’ve gotten? (Mine: Judgement during a 3am snack run. Let me eat my Pop-Tarts in peace, Karen.)  
- Anyone else’s deck low-key gaslight them?  

Bonus Drama:  
Tried cleansing my deck with sage. It gave me The Devil next day. Message received.   

PSA: If the Lovers card shows up post-ghosting? The universe isn’t clowning you—it’s handing you a flamethrower. 🔥

long post 

so I (F17) known this guy N (M17) for 12 years since we were 6. we only see each other during summer bc we work together at a summer job, where we as kids went for a great summer on the water. now we're teachers together and there's always been something between us I think, even when we were kids we always wanted to be close to each other and we are a great team. 

when we started teaching we were 15 and I think there became a different kind of chemistry. we joked a lot and we spended a lot more time with each other. I became quite attracted to him physically and never thought he saw me more as just childhood friends and colleagues. but when we work together there are these touches, if he walks around me he puts his hand gently on my waist and makes a full turn with it around, he does the same when he goes from the front. I honestly never thought something of it till I noticed he didn't do it with our other female colleagues. (were all around 16-19) 
he always remembers how I like my coffee and comes first thing in the morning with it. no one else does and he doesn't do it for anyone else. 
he also always sits next to me even when we're sitting in a big group he always tries to sit next to me. 
Last summer he even bicycled through a storm to out job just to discuss if we're gonna sail together since that year was the first year we didn't spend a week with each other. he has my number and we text each other always when we're gonna work so we can work together.
he also always teases me and compliments me, also he brought my favorite pastery last year when we went sailing. I'm also the only one that gets a hug from him and when we stand next to each other, he always toucher my arm with his or he pushes his hip against mine. 

I told my friends about this and they said he likes me romantically but idk. maybe we're all just seeing things bc my friends are also delulu. honestly, since last year I've started to feel attracted emotionally especially if I think back at the memories we have. 
now that work starts in 2 weeks I get more and more excited if he is there. my mother also always calls N a sweet and handsome boy and then she corrects herself and says he's really grown up to be a sweet man and I agree with her and she always loves to see us work together and spend time with each other. 

so idk maybe I'm seeing things, maybe I'm crazy bc I get this butterfly feeling and it hasn't been going away for 3 years so I think im attracted to him",2,1744281164.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False

Fair warning this isn’t edited,  proof read or well written– I’ve learnt that if I don’t write reports ‘stream of consciousness style’ then I tend to not write them at all. Any questions feel free to ask.
 

Lower budget trip – mostly hostel stays and public transportation, with some relative splurges on activities. I don’t care to calculate a full budget breakdown but was probably average 70-80 EUR/day not including (cheap Ryanair) flights.
 

 Pre-trip planning- everything was booked around 2 weeks beforehand– all trains were prebooked via Trenitalia, Hostels found through Hostelworld. Activities pre booked were a Skip-the-line to Basilica San Marco, Parmeggiano Cheese factory visit and a Balsamic Vinegar Producer tour.
 

Overview of trip:
 

Day 1, 2 in Verona with an afternoon trip to Peschiera la Garda
 

Day 3-6 Train to Venice Mestre, stayed in Mestre with trips into Venice, and waterbus to the islands of Murano and Burano.
 

Day 6-9 – Train to Bologna, walk up to San Luca for sunset, food four with Taste Bolgna and day trip to Modena, 4 Maddonne Caseificio and Acetia Giusti for cheese factory and Balsamic Vinegar producers tour. Lunch in Bologna and train back to Verona.
 

Day 10 – Flight back home in the morning.
 

Day 1 – arrival in Verona
 

Arrived in Verona in the early evening and walked straight on a bus to the main Station. I was staying in the Hostello which was a 40 minute walk from the station. While the station isn’t very fun to walk around once I got away from the station area I did end up walking through town which made walking worthwhile – seeing everyone out and about on a Sunday evening with the sun going down near the arena, walking their dogs etc. Arrived at the hostel around 1830 and headed out for a booked table at Osteria Ai Osei down the road- ate a ‘zucca’ ravioli (zucca can be pumpkin or squash, I’m not 100% sure which it was!), and a tiramisu - both very good- came to 24EUR including the corpeto/table charge and a glass of wine. I’m glad I booked this dinner, since I was too exhausted from activities to make it out after I crashed at the hostels in the evening for the rest of the trip.
 

Day 2 – Verona and Peschiera la Garda
 

 Walked up for a view from Castal san Pietro on a hill overlooking Verona city centre and the river. Zig – zagged though the city to ‘Juliets House’, a couple of cathedrals, eventually made my way to Piazza Bra and Verona Arena. The arena’s closed on Mondays so I only saw the outside. Hung around in the Piazza a bit – it’s very pleasant with trees, benches and a little fountain – far cry from the piazzas of Rome & Florence from my previous trip.
 

At this point I’d seen what I wanted to of Verona itself so I headed to the station - stopping for lunch at Bruschetteria Redoro on the way – 7.5EUR for a water, Veneto Bruschette inc 0.5EUR corpeto. Caught a train to Peschiera la Garda for a walk along the promenade, had some cake and stared at the lake & mountains. Quick train and long walk back to hostel. Too tired to head out for dinner so had 1EUR focaccia from supermarket across from the hostel ☹
 

Day 3 – Verona – Venice Mestre
 

Got a pistachio cornetto & espresso from… somewhere for 3.2EUR  round the corner before catching a train to Venice Mestre. Mestre is 2 train stops from Venice Santa Luca station, while it would have been nice to stay on the island itself, it’s so much cheaper to stay here. Checked into Meingeiner hostel a 5min walk from Meineger station – this was something like 25-30EUR per night and a secure, clean hostel, and they let me check in early – wholeheartedly recommend to anyone not needing to stay on the island itself. Caught a train (1.5EUR each way) into Venice proper. The moment I arrived I couldn’t bring myself to do anything except just… walk around the canals. I had a late lunch at Rio Novo restaurant – Cuttlefish ink pasta, a glass of wine and a ‘free’ limoncello for 25EUR – good but not great- but sitting by the canal watching the boats go by with a glass of wine WAS great.  Take caution any solo traveller who orders any ink dish though – I was paranoid for the rest of the day it had stained my teeth (: Spent the rest of the day wandering some more, poking around the shops- I saw a free pirate costume exhibition with a demonstration of clay mask making, a glassblower, a neat but also closed little shop with an honesty box to buy his trinkets from, and more gallerys, passisteries than I will ever remember – don’t think I could point to any of them on a map either. At some point around sunset I realised I wasn’t far from St Marco’s Piazza so I got my phone back out for directions -not exactly necessary but I was getting blisters and needed the efficiency. Got to the square to see it all lit up at night – wonderful, and made better as it was the last day of carnival, so there were people dressed up all over the place- period costumes with masks, Halloween – style costumes, someone dressed up as a giant pizza slice etc. Walked back after some people watching alone the rialto bridge and caught a train back to Mestre – arrived about 2030 and just crashed for about 11hrs.
 
Day 4 – Venice Museum day
 
I’d booked a 0930hrs skip-the-line ticket into St Marco’s Basilica for 6EUR – partly a tactical decision so I got into Venice nice and early. Caught the train, brought a 35EUR 48hr waterbus ticket and got to the square before 9. Grabbed a pistachio cornetto for 1.5EUR. A little waiting around for the Basilica to open but got to see seagulls stealing people’s breakfasts so worth it. The basilica seemed popular so those wanting to go, especially in high season might need to book in advance.
 

I honestly didn’t think much of the interior to be honest- the basilica itself is much more impressive on the outside and doesn’t hold a candle to, say the Vatican. If you have visited other cathedrals in Italy you may be also a little underwhelmed. The do sell tickets inside for extra sections which I also found a bit scummy. I left the Basilica proper after less than 10minutes, but I did see a corner with some pews so I went to sit for a bit. And then got caught in Ash Wednesday Mass. Not too awkward as I think there were other tourists there too.
 

At around 11 I decided to buy a ticket for Doge’s Palace – I didn’t buy in advance as I wanted to make sure I had enough time to explore Venice itself, but having a long wander the day before I had the time. There was no wait to speak of. It was 30EUR – they only sell tickets for Doge and the ‘four’ St Marco square museums – a bit misleading as all 4 museum collections are in one building. I was more satisfied with the Palace visit than the Basilica despite the price – the Palace section is grand and interesting, but heading across the bridge of sighs into the prison section was really cool. Parts of prison is also skipped by a lot of people- there were sections where I was the only one about (I didn’t go the wrong way- I did check!) which was a pretty surreal experience in such a touristed city.
 

After the palace, I realised I hadn’t eaten anything but cake all day so naturally I grabbed a gelato (4EUR) from the promenade by the square – surprisingly good considering the location. Then headed into the Museo Correr which was included in the Doge ticket. It wasn’t that interesting honestly but they have places to sit and free toilets – so if you already have the ticket, and the time, why not.
 
The rest of the day was spent wandering again with no real goal expect make my way to Bar All’Arco – the oldest cichetti place in Venice– this came recommended to me by someone at the hostel  - of course, it was closed. I got some from a place nearby instead = 9EUR for 3 pieces – a salted cod, machengo cheese with beetroot and some cured meat of some sort – they were enjoyable, but overpriced in my opinion – think this a common thought on Venetian food. More aimless wandering until I found myself at the station at sunset. And… burger king was right there, ok. 12EUR for a random burger meal – the touchscreens didn’t work well so I’m not sure what I got, but sitting stuffing my face with a burger overlooking the grand canal was pretty funny to me. Got back to the hostel around 8pm so door-to-door was out around 12hrs.
 

Day 5 – Murano, Burano, Waterbus at Night
 

Transfer Venice station onto the Waterbus for a trip to Muran – Burano islands. Used the 48hrs ticket from yesterday. Waterbus easy enough to navigate. Stopped at Murano for a walk, a breakfast gelato and 10EUR visit to the glass museum. A small museum but worth it in my opinion, some wonderful models in there. Lots of shops and producers of Murano glass in the area which I heard do demonstrations but didn’t visit.
 

Another waterbus to Burano – one of the highlights of Venice, lovely colourful houses, while still touristy it felt a lot more residential than Murano. Just really great to walk around for a while. Got a fired fish platter from AI Banky and a liminchello spritz for 15EUR –pretty good, especially for the price and location.
 

Waterbus back, brought a weird fruitcake with fennel from a bakery for 5EUR, had some daylight to spare so got the route 1 waterbus through the grand canal as the sun went down – great way to say goodbye to Venice. Limped back to Mestre, patched up my blisters and packed my bag for Bologna!
 

Day 6 – to Bologna, sunset walk to San Luca hilltop
 

I’d booked a train for midday from Mestre to Bologna expecting to be needing a restful morning – planning me was correct, I was exhausted. Felt a headache coming on but the hostel did a breakfast with coffee, juice and water and cornetto for 6EUR – quality was just ok but the rest and liquids was necessary to continue the trip.
 

2hr train journey to Bologna, booked a food tour for tomorrow on the train.
 

Stayed:  at Bohoostel– which was cheaper than Dopa- but still not cheap- 40/46/33EUR on Fri-Sat-Sun. Decent hostel with good kitchen, but a large hostel with heavy firedoors that echoed through the building. 20mins walk from the station and 30mins from Bologna centre -walk to bologna is very nice though, through the porticos.  
 

Checked in around 1400hrs stopped by Eh Ban Ban pizza – small pizza shop, massive pizzas – their signature bologna pizza 13EUR served as both lunch and dinner. Very, vey good – mortadella, asparagus and burrata, not to mention being the size of my torso. Burned it off heading up to the San Luca cathedral and viewpoint. This is a steep uphill climb through the covered porticos present throughout Bologna- a tough climb for my pizza filled self but well worth – San luca church was free to enter and, while Italian cathedrals do start to blend together after you see a few, was better than average. Seeing the surrounding hillsides were lovely too and a nice change from Venice. I was there for sunset, and while I was a bit concerned about walking back, the porticos were lit up that evening- absolutely recommend for sunset for those who have the time. Got back to the hostel around 1900 but just crashed in the evening.
 
 
 
Day 7 – Food tour of Bologna + explore Bologna
 

Taste Bologna 97EUR 4hr food tour in the morning- this was the most expensive single day experience I have ever done- I wasn’t sure it would be worth the money but looking back on the memories I made while I write this - I would say so. The guide was local and had an awful lot to say about food from the region – I’m not sure there was a moment he ever stopped talking during the entire tour.
 

The tour starts with a speciality coffee at Aroma coffee- I got a expresso-custard monstrosity which was absolutely delicious – probably the best thing I had on the trip and certainly the best coffee.
 

Then continues with a market tour and a tortellini + broth sample sized serving. It was nice to visit the produce market and seeing the handmade pasta shops while getting a little information on what was in season, local specialities etc.
 

I expected lunch to be a regular restaurant meal but actually was more like a picnic in the oldest and only traditional Osteria (as in, only serving alcohol, bring your own food) in Bologna- this was pretty damn cool to be honest. There were breads, meats cheeses and dressings collected during the tour and served with wine and samples of traditional balsamic vinegar. There was more food and wine than the table could eat, including my greedy self. 
 

Finished off with a gelato (good, not fantastic) and a few recipe cards with I have yet to try.
 

It was a Saturday so spent the rest of the afternoon strolling through the markets (food and flea) and seeing the city centre sights – the two towers and main square. I didn’t come to Bologna for the sights really but Basilica di San Petronio was worth seeing inside and out. Headed back to the hostel and got a pistachio crepe on the way – 4.5EUR. Worth it just to see a literal bucket of pistachio cream.
 

Was wiped and completely full again so had to just lie down for the evening when I got back -story of most of my trips.
 

Day 8 – Day trip to Modena, Parmigiano Cheese factory visit and a Balsamic Vinegar Producer tour.
 

Best day of the trip and one of the best food related things I have ever done – if anyone has recommendations for  similar food producer tours anywhere in the world I would hear them!
 

I pre booked a tour of 4 Maddonne Caseificio and Acetaia Giusti – both on the outskirts of Modena. Caught a train from Bologna to Modena (25mins, 3.5EUR each way) and then a taxi from the station (18EUR). Buses do exist but apparently must be pre-booked and barely exist on a Sunday as it was.
 

The Caseificio tour was booked for 11AM and cost 20EUR on arrival. Only morning tours get to see any of the cheese production, and while I think the 11AM tour does usually see a little, one of the tour members had a medical emergency so we started late, and we only got to see the tubs being washed after production. Still incredibly cool though and this tour would be 100% worth it just to stare at thousands of wheels of cheese. You also get a sample plate of differently aged cheeses and jams after. There was also wine, but no one else wanted any and I was too shy to open it ☹
 

Acetaia Giusti is a Balsamic museum/producer a 25 minute walk away from 4 Madonne. Honestly the walk could be a little dicey in bad weather as there’s no path in places, but it was sunny at the time. The walk goes through a village with a handful of restaurants, but it was Sunday so they were all closed. But the Acetaia grounds were nice and had a few benches for me to wait for the 1330 tour. The tours are free but must be booked in advance, and predicably end in their shop. As the tour was fairly busy with 20+ participants I didn’t feel any pressure to buy though- I was planning on using flying with no cabin bag as an excuse but no one asked.
 
The tour takes about an hour – particular highlight include sniffing a 300 year old balsamic vienegar fossil and seeing/smelling all the aging barrells – followed by a tasting of some of their products. Note that only one of the samples is the tradional 12+  y/o stuff- understandable when it comes to 55EUR a bottle! The rest of the samples are all younger vinegars and/or blends – all were delicious but I actually has more traditional vinegar the day before during the food tour in Bologna.
 

Shared a taxi with others on the tour back to Modena – I think the total was 20-25 EUR but they would only accept 5EUR from me! Had a little wander round Modena itself but it was that awkward witching hour between lunch and dinner where there weren’t many food options available.
 
Got a train back to Bologna around 1800, had a Nutella espresso (2EUR, disgusting) and a weird vending machine sandwich (also 2EUR, not disgusting) at the station. It being a Sunday, and me being exhausted again, I didn’t want to navigate what to eat for dinner so I went to Ragu- a takeaway Bolognese place and had their traditional ragu with tagliatelle for 9EUR from a paper box.
 

Day 9 – Lunch in Bologna, afternoon train (eventually…) back to Verona.
 

Spent the morning in Bologna before my 2pm train, wadered the markets again, grabbed breakfast somewhere I can’t recall,  had lunch at Sfoglia Rina- definitely not a traditional place but did feel solo traveller and tourist friendly. They have a big table for solo/small groups. Ate Parmesan sauce tortellini for 15EUR (price includes water and side salad).
 

It was as this point that a checked my Trenitalia app and saw.. my train was cancelled? No email or choice to refund though… great. Grabbed my bag and spoke to customer service- I didn’t realise this at the time of booking, but I’d actually booked the German train of the day and sat waiting for a replacement bus with a group of Austrians for an hour before being told to just head back and book a new ticket to Verona. I honestly should have done this in the beginning to save myself the stress because the next train to Verona didn’t leave until around 1600. All good though as this train was Italian and actually existed, so got back to Verona that evening.
 

Stayed in Vicolo Colombina 22 – this was more of an Air BnB type place (albeit booked through hostelworld) but quite reasonably priced for a private room – about 55EUR0 and much more central than the Hostello – I’d consider this again if I ever returned to Verona just to have less walking.
 

Had a quick trip into Verona proper in search of souvenirs and food – dinner was a ‘tiramisu bubble tea’-… not great or even good but I had to try it.
 

Day 10- early morning flight home from Verona – left the B&B at 0600hr ☹ The buses leave regularly from the main station and take contactless- easy, seamless journey and check in. Verona airport is quite nice but be aware there are no shops once you go through international check-in.
 


What I missed out on/what you could consider instead:
 
All the museums in Verona and the Arena where both closed on Mondays when I was there – I think the arena would be well worth a visit if you can get there in it’s opening hours. They also have concerts there sometimes which I would definitely go back to Verona to see if I could.
 

I would’ve liked to hop on a boat Peschiera la Garda to get a view of the lake- some boats also went to Sirmione (also could catch a bus)- spa town with a medieval castle.
 

Doge’s Palace has some rooms only accessible if you book a ‘Secret Itinerary’ guided tour for 32EUR- if I could do everything over I probably would have booked this instead.  But it needs to be booked in advance. If I could do this trip all over again I would probably skip the Venice Museums and book this instead.
 

During my Mirano-Burano vist if there had been more daylight I would’ve caught the waterbus to the residential island of Lido for the views of Venice and the beach.
 

I had booked to go on a full day food tour with Emilia Romagna tours originally but this was cancelled/refunded not long after booking (suspect due to a planned train strike that day). I was pretty upset about the cancellation originally as this was my main inspiration for heading to the region in the first place. I’d seen rave reviews about the Italian Days food tours all over the place but they didn’t accept solo bookings – Emilia Romagna tours do and have a similar programme, unfortunately the tour ended up no going ahead but they did refund me within a couple of days, so while I can’t vouch for the quality of their tour they are at least a reputable company (: The full day tour was a Dairy Visit, a Balsamic Vinegar Producer tour and a Proscuttio factory tour (plus lunch) so at least I managed 2/3. 
 

Another option for an Acetaia tour could be Acetaia di Giorgio – they’re a 35 minute uninteresting walk from the station though. They came up a couple of times during my research and a quick look on their website shows they only sell traditional aged DOP vinegar so you might actually get to try the elusive Juniper aged one. They don’t charge for tours though so I’d only book if you’re actually planning on buying a bottle.
 

I would also recommend actually booking and eating at restaurants more evenings than me if you have the energy 😊",7,1744280838.0,solotravel,1,0.82,False
