1my8lh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1my8lh7/should_you_try_osteo_biflex_triple_strength/,Should You Try Osteo Bi-Flex Triple Strength Glucosamine Supplement Review for Joint Health?,"Testing the *Osteo Bi-Flex 67930 Triple Strength Glucosamine with Turmeric* turned out to be an insightful experience. Known for its promise to support joint health and flexibility, this product piqued my interest after countless glowing testimonials, but as I integrated it into my daily routine, I noted some nuances worth sharing. My knees, not-so-affectionately referred to as ""the creaky hinges,"" have been a recurring issue, so having something that combines glucosamine with turmeric caught my attention. With an 80-count bottle designed for long-term use, this supplement had a lot to live up to.

**Packaging and Design**  
The container is as straightforward as they come. The bright design immediately communicates the product‚Äôs purpose‚Äîjoint care‚Äîwith clarity. The 80-count unit is compact, measuring 2.88 x 2.88 x 5.63 inches, which made it an easy fit in my pantry. Each tablet is perfectly coated, ensuring they‚Äôre easy to swallow without leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. As someone who can be picky about tablet textures, this small detail mattered more than I initially thought.

**How it Worked for Me**  
After incorporating these tablets into my daily routine, I began noticing subtle changes within two weeks. My morning stiffness started to ease up, primarily after sitting at my desk for hours. One standout feature is the inclusion of Joint Shield 5-LOXIN Advanced, a clinically studied herbal extract. The promise of improvement within seven days might sound ambitious, but I have to admit it delivered noticeable comfort. My grandmother, who tried it alongside me, described it as ‚Äúa step back in time‚Äù for her joints. 

**[Check Osteo Bi-Flex 67930 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b06wrp5fyd/)**  

**Good Aspects**  
The positives were evident during the testing phase, where several points stood out:  
- Effortlessly targets occasional stiffness and discomfort with natural ingredients.  
- Inclusion of turmeric provides an antioxidant boost.  
- Clinically backed 5-LOXIN Advanced delivers results fast.  
- Glucosamine chondroitin ensures sustained joint support for long-term use.  

**Minus Points**  
However, no product is perfect, and there are some drawbacks I encountered during use:  
- Tablets are on the larger side, which might be challenging for those with swallowing difficulties.  
- The unflavored formula might not appeal to everyone, especially those sensitive to earthy tastes.  
- It lacks additional vitamins like Vitamin D or Calcium that could complement joint health.

**Ease of Use and Setting Expectations**  
Adjusting to the daily intake of this supplement felt seamless. The tablets slid into my routine as naturally as my morning coffee. That said, managing expectations was key. While the soothing benefits were tangible, it‚Äôs not a miracle worker for severe joint damage. This is best suited for maintenance and mild discomfort, rather than chronic conditions requiring medical interventions.

**Competing Products**  
In the highly competitive market of joint supplements, several alternatives vie for attention. For instance, Move Free Joint Health Advantage is another prominent choice. While the latter includes hyaluronic acid for joint lubrication, it lacks the turmeric that stands out in Osteo Bi-Flex. Another rival, Solgar Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM, caters more to purists seeking a formula free of extra herbal additives, but its slower onset might not win over those looking for quicker relief. In the end, the versatility and well-rounded support offered by this product shine, especially for those seeking a mix of joint nourishment and antioxidant power. 

**Financial Value**  
For what it offers, this supplement‚Äôs price point feels justified. The rapid results and clinically verified ingredients add up to substantial value. Compared to competitors in the same vein, the cost-to-quality ratio leans favorably. It pairs exceptionally well with those aiming to maintain active lifestyles without breaking the bank. This isn‚Äôt an overpriced health gimmick, but a practical addition to one‚Äôs regimen.

NOW, I usually drink a lot of coffee. Most days, I have a 16-oz mug in the morning and another 16 or 8-oz mug in the afternoon after lunch. I'm a working mom, so I need it to function lol. 

During my first pregnancy, coffee wasn't an issue because I wasn't drinking it at the time (had nothing to do with pregnancy, I'd quit it a long time before that). I picked it up again with my son as a newborn, and now I get these horrible headaches when I don't drink it. 

From my research online, it says you can't have more than 200mg of coffee per day. Am I right to estimate that just my morning cup contains about 400mg? I make it in a moka pot with ground coffee. Maybe like 3-4 teaspoons of it for my 16-oz morning mug?

Basically it‚Äôs an event with a mock fashion platform in the main hall where students can come into college dressed in their traditional culture attire to celebrate diversity and inclusion. It was my second time coming to this event, as it‚Äôs a yearly event, and both me and my friend were really excited! 

For this year, we thought it would be fun to dress up in each others clothes instead of our own. FWIW I am Chinese ethically. My friend S who is of Indian heritage, brought a beautiful pink and silver sari with gold jewellery and I gave her a red and gold qipao to wear with some hair adornments. We got ready at her house before college, then walked to college together. 

On our way we stopped at a coffee shop and and my friend went into the bathroom, I waited for our drinks. A group of women came in and I could tell they were whispering about me as I could see them blatantly staring. Fair enough, I am dressed unusually. One of them comes over and asks if I am Indian. (She looks Caucasian)

I reply that I‚Äôm not, and she asks if I think it‚Äôs ok that I‚Äôm culturally appropriating Indian culture. 
Now I‚Äôm surprised because to me, culture appropriation is when someone from outside of a culture dresses themselves up with an intention to mock or make fun if that culture, which I am not. I am simply appreciating said culture, as my friend is with mine.

I ask her if she thinks it‚Äôs ok for her as a white woman to go up to POCs in public and tell them how they‚Äôre allowed to dress. 
She looks shocked, tuts and rolls her eyes before going back to her friends, who all look a little embarrassed

My friend comes out of the bathroom, I hand her our drinks and tell her about our interaction on the walk to college. She thinks it‚Äôs hilarious. However another friend, said that it was rude the way I responded and I was unnecessarily hostile when I could have just explained about the event and what me and my friend were doing.

I have to first wake her up and tell her, ""Eat eat! Eat your food!"" There's a bit of a verbal argument, because she doesn't want to wake up.

She gets scooped up and gently poured in front of her food bowl. She goes to her water bowl instead and meows. Ok, fresh wawa first. Let's get fresh wawa. 

I set the bowl down, make a dinging sound against the glass with my finger nail, and she acknowledges that it's fresh. We do this every meal. 

I try to get her attention back to her food bowl. I kneel and even scratch on the mat and say, ""Be a good girl! Eat your food!"" She scratches a bit after me. But IDK if she's saying ""fuck this smelly shit"" or what.

She takes a few hesitant bites. ""GOOD girl! So GOOD! Eat your food!"" I just want my coffee, hurry the fuck up.

The more verbal encouragement/petting she gets, the more likely she will eat her food. On the rare occasion she's awake before I am and leading me into our routine, she still needs to be told to eat like a good girl.

At bedtime, she walks around on my chest, stepping on my tits dead center, meowing. She won't stop until I say, ""Ni-night!"" Then she immediately lays down. But never before being told to.

She does not like being scolded or yelled at. She will throw a tantrum, make huffing sounds, run around, and knock things over or quickly scratch on furniture in a flurry. Doing everything she's not allowed to all at once in some kind of retaliation? for being yelled at.

But she is otherwise a very nice girl. Friendly to everyone. If I tell her to ""Be nice to bug,"" she stops swatting at it. 

She uses her scratching post weirdly. Not just to scratch, but when she's trying to express herself, her will, or has something to say. Like a talking stick. But scratching activates it. 

We all turn our heads towards her when she uses it, because it's important to hear what she has to say. She sounds like when you pinch the end of a balloon just enough to let air squeak out, for ten seconds. 

Is this the consequence of gentle parenting? Her 2 year old sister is starting to mimic this behavior, and they both have to be picked up and carried to their meals and told to be good girls and eat.

1my8fyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1my8fyi/i_am_sick_of_drinking_mediocre_coffee_15004000/,I am sick of drinking mediocre coffee [$1500-4000],"I am sick and tired of not drinking the espresso I want every day. 

Here my story and situation, briefly:

I have always loved coffee, but it wasn‚Äôt until I got to Italy for the first time that I had a ‚Äúwhere has this cappuccino been all my life?!‚Äù experience. I would place multiple orders, and ask for it late in the afternoon, both to looks of disapproval. Subsequent trips solidified my sense that I was being deprived in my daily home pour-over or drip coffee. 

So I bought a Breville Barista Express. Not to offend anyone, but this machine was frustrating to me, and ultimately a big disappointment.  While I pulled a few good shots, most were inadequate, and the machine was inconsistent. It became more erratic, and I gave up in frustration. Admittedly there were multiple problems not only with the machine but with me. I didn‚Äôt fully commit to improving technique. I used the built-in grinder. I didn‚Äôt attend to evenly distributing the coffee in the portafilter before tamping. Etc. So it wasn‚Äôt *only* the machine. But I have read that a skilled barista can make a good espresso with a bad machine, and that mediocre machines are less forgiving, so the inexperienced user of a beginner machine has two strikes against them.

Life is short, and I don‚Äôt want to spend it not drinking great espresso. So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking:
I don‚Äôt want to be foolish and spend money frivolously, but I‚Äôm willing to put in the time and effort. I have been researching and reading. I‚Äôve looked at grinders and I‚Äôm thinking about the Mazzer Philos. Single dose, readily available from a proven company, aesthetically beautiful, not plastic, and spending more seems like a mission with diminishing returns. And I‚Äôm thinking about the Rancilio Silvia Pro X, although giving thought to the Mechanika Max or maybe I don‚Äôt need to spend that much, and I could get the same bang for my buck with the Lelit Victoria.

So please tell me whether it seems ridiculous to spend this much as a beginner, and whether I‚Äôm missing the obvious choice. Frankly I am ok with the money, but I don‚Äôt want to be foolish. And there‚Äôs also a lot to be said for the pure enjoyment of the equipment. Which I have a hard time assessing not having seen these in person or used them. And I‚Äôm not even sure whether I‚Äôm deliberating over meaningful things. 

Any thoughts appreciated!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Reds vs. Diamondbacks: A Statistical Circus with a Side of Humor**  
The Cincinnati Reds (-128) and Arizona Diamondbacks (+108) clash in a matchup that‚Äôs less ‚ÄúDavid vs. Goliath‚Äù and more ‚ÄúGoliath vs. Goliath with a slight limp.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down like a Vegas bookie who‚Äôs had one too many margaritas.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Real Deal?

The Reds are favorites, but not by a landslide. Their implied probability of winning? **56.3%** (thanks to those -128 odds). The D-backs, at +108, imply a **48.1%** chance‚Äîso close to a coin flip, it‚Äôs like betting on whether your morning coffee will spill or just steam.

Historically, Cincinnati thrives when favored: **56.2% win rate** in similar scenarios. Arizona? They‚Äôre the underdog specialists, winning **44.9%** of their dog roles. But here‚Äôs the kicker: The Reds‚Äô pitching staff has a **2.61 ERA** over their last 10 games, while Arizona‚Äôs staff ERA sits at **4.20**. The Diamondbacks‚Äô offense? A home-run machine (13 in 10 games), but their pitching? A sieve that could pass for a colander at a cheese festival.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Power, and Pitching Mysteries

**Cincinnati Reds**:

Like imagine you get a text:

You could just say yes or no. Over time, the AI would learn who you click with, what kinds of stuff you like doing, and stop pairing you with people you don‚Äôt vibe with.

And it doesn‚Äôt have to be just sports. It could be a knitting group at a coffee shop, going to see a movie, Bible study, hitting the gym, renting e-bikes, whatever. Basically thousands of possible activities.

1my88eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1my88eb/should_covergirl_ultra_matte_lipstick_be_your/,Should COVERGIRL Ultra Matte Lipstick Be Your Next Go To Beauty Buy?,"Testing out the COVERGIRL Exhibitionist Ultra Matte Lipstick 3616302467969 has been an interesting journey for my makeup collection. I‚Äôve always had a love-hate relationship with matte lipsticks because, while the colors are stunning, the formulas can often feel like I‚Äôve plastered my lips with cement. Spoiler alert: this one didn‚Äôt disappoint on the former, but let‚Äôs dig into the details.

**Eye-Catching Design**

The packaging immediately caught my attention. It‚Äôs sleek, modern, and honestly feels premium for its price range. Sliding it into my makeup bag, I noticed how compact it is‚Äîa great feature for anyone who constantly needs to reapply lipstick on-the-go (though we‚Äôll talk about how little that‚Äôs necessary in a bit). The matte black tube with bold text makes it easy to spot‚Äîeven in a chaotic purse.  

**Comfortable Formula with Surprising Hydration**

With a matte lipstick, I‚Äôm always afraid of the dreaded dry-lips syndrome. Testing this formula, I wasn‚Äôt expecting the hydrating punch it packed. Right upon application, my lips felt smoother, and that claim about increasing lip moisture by 40%? I‚Äôm not a scientist, but my lips actually felt softer after wearing it for hours. It‚Äôs an odd feeling when something matte seems to secretly double as a moisturizer.  

**Want the lowest COVERGIRL 3616302467969 price? Click Amazon now.**

**Color Payoff and Longevity**

If bold, vibrant colors are what you‚Äôre after, this lipstick delivers in spades. I tried the shade ‚ÄúWink Wink,‚Äù and let‚Äôs just say, it had people asking me what I was wearing more times than I could count. The pigments are incredibly rich, but what‚Äôs more impressive is how long-lasting this lipstick is. I didn‚Äôt experience any bleeding or feathering, even after sipping coffee and munching on snacks. It genuinely outperformed some high-end brands in this department.  

**Cruelty-Free and Kind to Animals**

COVERGIRL earns big points in my book for being cruelty-free. Knowing that what I‚Äôm using on my face hasn‚Äôt harmed any animals is a major plus. Their Leaping Bunny Certification ensures you can wear their products guilt-free‚Äîa huge win for animal lovers.  

**Perks**

- Rich, transfer-resistant colors draw attention instantly.  
- Formula increases lip moisture instead of drying them out.  
- Doesn‚Äôt feather, bleed, or require constant touch-ups.  

**Negatives**

- Though transfer-resistant, it‚Äôs not entirely transfer-proof.  
- Some shades might not suit all skin tones, so a test before committing may help.  

**Competing Brands**

Comparing it to other lipsticks I‚Äôve tried, it stands toe-to-toe with premium brands like MAC, which offer bold colors but often fall short on wearability for extended hours. Unlike those, this doesn‚Äôt desert your lips mid-day. Affordable drugstore options, like Maybelline‚Äôs Super Stay Matte Ink, might rival in terms of longevity but tend to feel heavier on the lips. COVERGIRL‚Äôs lightweight formula gives it an edge.  

**Cost Efficiency**

Without revealing exact pricing, this lipstick is undoubtedly a bargain for the quality it delivers. The hydration, long-lasting color, and cruelty-free edge make the investment worth it. While there are cheaper options available, I‚Äôd argue this hits the perfect medium between affordability and results.

I have a video tour on YouTube I'll share in a chat)

Hey All!

I've got a room opening up at the end of the month for one room in our South Baker Beach townhome. Move in date can be flexible. 

The home is 4 bedrooms with 2.5 bathrooms, one of the full baths is in the master bedroom. The home is two levels, and the four bedrooms are on the second floor, with all of the common area on the main floor.  You'll share 1.5 bathrooms between 3 people.

I've been here 5 years, and the home is *well* equipped and furnished, though, you'll need to furnish the bedroom. However, if you move quick, the departing tenant has some stuff he'd want to leave here. So, if you need a queen bed/frame, that can be yours. Bed is in great condition and he's had it wrapped in plastic since purchasing. 

The common area has literally everything we need: vacuum, rug doctor, wet mop, brooms, like 100 microfiber rags, washer/dryer, cooking supplies, 4k TV with streaming services, fully furnished living and dining room, and every cleaning supply you could imagine. We have plenty of off street parking, as well as one spot that is reserved for our unit that we all share, however, there is only 1 car here right now. So, you'd have access to the reserved parking spot. The kitchen is big and well equipped. I've purchased a secondary stainless steel prep table, an additional mini fridge, we have a massive walk-in pantry, and tons of cooking supplies. If you have nothing to cook with, that is fine. We can share. We also have a microwave, instapot, rice cooker, blender, toaster, coffee maker... most anything you'd need to cook.

The unit also has tons of storage. We have two outdoor storage units, including a walk-in shed that could hold like 6 bikes if we needed it too, we also have two common closets, and a crawl space under our stairs that can accommodate a ton of stuff. The bedrooms in this unit are small, but we have a bunch of common space that make up for it. 

For the roommates, we are all men. I'm in my mid 30's, we've got another guy about the same age, and then a younger guy in his mid 20's. Harmony and cooperation are good right now. And we'd like to keep it that way. This is a very low event home, not much foot traffic at all, and we do a great job to share chores for deep cleaning days, as well as the daily upkeep living in a home with 4 people requires. Cleanliness here is great, and important to us. We've got a spread sheet lol. The goal is to keep the home clean, instead of clean it when it gets dirty. 

Everyone is *busy.* With good jobs and good hobbies. So again, not a lot of foot traffic here. Everyone stays busy outside the home. We value peace and quite, and have established quite hours between 10pm and 9am. So, its always easy to find rest and relaxation here. This isn't a party house. Additionally, all the common space is on the first floor, separated from the bedrooms. So, its easy to get away from it all. Or, if you want to stay up late and do your thing, the quite hours do not prevent that. We all get along here really well. 

Financials: 

* $1150 monthly rent
* $100-150 utilities (water, gas, sewer, electric, internet)
* $1350 deposit
* $46 application fee

For the deposit, the lease is old, so basically all the wear and tear is accounted for already. I've never withheld a deposit for damages. The deposit on the room is $1150, then that $200 goes towards your last two months of utilities. The way that the presidio handles utilities, is that they bill them almost 3 months late. If you move out, that $200 covers your last two months of utilities. When you move in, you'll not owe utilities for three months.

This is a great price for this unit. I've locked in this pricing from a lease takeover that started about 10 years ago, and I negotiated a big rent reduction during COVID. Another unit on our little townhome building just rented for $5,800, well above the rent here. This is a great deal.

For the lease term, you'll be taking over another tenant's portion of the lease, which will end April 30th. You'll be on the lease. When the lease ends, we plan to renew. The current tenants here have no plans to leave at the end of the lease, and ideally, we'd be looking for another long-term roommate. This can be an excellent long-term rental, but we are willing to accommodate short-term as well.  

If you'd rather not stay the full term of the remaining lease, you just need to find someone to fill the remainder of your lease responsibility, which is just how it goes here, and what we are doing now. All of the roommates here will help with getting you off the lease, if need be. It's a team effort. That said, we will be giving preference to roommates that want to stay long-term. 

There is one dog here, a 17 year old 40 pound pit mix. He's hella old, and we don't want to add another pet until he's no longer with us. This room is also for single occupancy, no couples please. If you are a couple, we can discuss it, but not at $1150/month. 

Chat me if you seem like a good fit! From their, I'll share more pictures as well as the video tour. Also, take some time to tell me about yourself, its important we are a good fit. 

Good luck house hunting!

Using the Brita SAFF-100/FF-100 Faucet Mount Water Filter has been a fairly satisfying experience overall. I‚Äôve had it mounted on my kitchen faucet for a couple of months now, and I must say‚Äîthe convenience of having fresh, filtered water on demand can‚Äôt be overstated. At first glance, the sleek white design blends effortlessly with most kitchen setups, which was a win since my counter already has a minimalist vibe. It weighs only 0.96 ounces, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre adding bulky equipment to your faucet.

Testing this water filter daily, I‚Äôve been amazed by its ability to enhance water quality. Living in a city, the tap water tends to carry the faint scent of chlorine, but this filter does an exceptional job reducing that odor and improving the overall taste. Occasionally, I use it while cooking, especially for tasks like boiling pasta or brewing coffee, and it feels reassuring to know impurities like lead are mostly eliminated.  

**Convenient Features and Performance**

This tap-mounted water filter truly shines when it comes to versatility. It offers three dispensing modes‚Äîfiltered water, unfiltered water, and an unfiltered spray‚Äîwhich accommodate all kinds of daily household uses. Switching between these options is incredibly simple; the lever feels solid yet easy to adjust. Since I drink directly from this filter, the Advanced Brita Carbon-Block technology has become a household favorite. It‚Äôs even certified to reduce over 60 contaminants, including 99% of lead, which greatly minimizes concerns about what‚Äôs in our water.

One of the most useful features is the digital filter indicator that conveniently tells me when it‚Äôs time for a replacement. Apparently, each filter lasts approximately 100 gallons or about four months (depending on usage). I haven‚Äôt had to replace mine yet, but my neighbors report the process is quick and hassle-free, requiring no tools. Given how busy life gets, not having to constantly monitor filter conditions manually is a plus.  

**[Check Brita SAFF-100/FF-100 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00006iv0p/)**  

**Advantages**

- Effortlessly enhances water taste by reducing chlorine odor and other impurities.  
- Saves money and promotes sustainability, replacing up to 2,250 single-use plastic water bottles annually.  
- Digital filter indicator takes the guesswork out of maintenance.  
- Offers universal adapters for standard faucets, making installation easy and fuss-free.  

**Areas of Concern**

- Doesn‚Äôt fit pull-out or spray-style faucets, which might limit compatibility for some users.  
- The filter, although efficient, adds a slight bulk to the faucet which could be bothersome in tighter kitchen spaces.  
- Initial water flow can reduce slightly, especially on older plumbing systems.  

**Usage Experience and Family Feedback**

One weekend, my cousin came to visit, and she instantly noticed the improvement in water taste. She‚Äôs remarkably health-conscious, so I let her know about the contaminants it reduces, from benzene to sediment, and she immediately wanted to order one for herself. Another interesting anecdote came from my pre-teen nephew, who usually insists on bottled water because he claims tap water tastes ‚Äúweird.‚Äù He‚Äôs been drinking straight from the faucet when visiting us now, so I think that‚Äôs a big sign of success.  

The Brita faucet filter has even become a go-to during our gardening (yes, filtered water for my wife‚Äôs floral arrangements might be a tad over-the-top, but she‚Äôs happy!). These tiny conveniences add up to make it an indispensable part of our kitchen setup.

**Product Rivals**

While I‚Äôve enjoyed using this faucet filter, there are plenty of other options in this category. PUR makes a faucet mount filter that matches Brita‚Äôs filtration capability in many ways, and I‚Äôve tested it over at a colleague‚Äôs place. Its installation seemed just as straightforward, and it offers robust filtration like Brita. What stands out with Brita, however, is its lightweight build and sleeker overall appearance. Another option worth mentioning is the Culligan FM-25 filter. It‚Äôs compact and filters impressively well for its size, but the lack of multi-spray options is where it trails behind the Brita.

From a price-to-performance perspective, these alternatives hold their ground. However, Brita seems ideal for homes like mine with moderate usage and a preference for aesthetically pleasing designs.

**Price Performance**

Speaking of cost, the faucet filter falls squarely into the ‚Äúworth every penny‚Äù category. Its ability to replace thousands of water bottles annually makes it an eco-friendly choice that feels like a noble cause wrapped up in necessity. Considering its features‚Äîmulti-spray settings, advanced filtration, and filter lifespan‚Äîit‚Äôs rare to find a product as versatile at such a reasonable price point. Even factoring in future filter replacements, the sheer convenience and taste improvement make it a no-brainer in my book.

I am currently planning on landing at CDG the morning of Sep 12th and taking the train from the airport into the city to see the Notre Dame Cathedral and Sainte-Chappelle before catching a train down to Marseille in the afternoon.

My question is this: I am hoping to find a nice spot to sit, preferably outside, and enjoy some coffee and baked goods, and enjoy some people watching/ambiance after my red eye from the US before I start sightseeing.

Details on the SunDay event:  https://www.sunday.earth/

If you're an EV driver, bring out your vehicle to show others how driving electric works.  You DO NOT need to be there the whole time (2 - 7 PM).  Come and go as you need or desire.  We appreciate any presence of EVs at the event.  I'm sure you'll have lots of conversations about driving and charging.

If your vehicle has V2L (vehicle to load), consider bringing something to show off that capability (coffee pot, fan, etc.).  If you have home solar, bring some literature or graphs that show how you drive on sunshine!

If you're thinking of going electric, come out and meet others who have made the leap and find out from the ""horse's mouth"" of how it really works.  

Stay tuned for the exact location and details.  

This event is also listed on the National Drive Electric Month page.  Please register there so we know what vehicles to expect:  https://driveelectricmonth.org/event?eventid=4923

Stress levels were no higher than normal until this started happening, now i can‚Äôt think about anything besides my heart and my life is miserable. It‚Äôs crippling, i‚Äôve had multiple kidney stones and never shed a tear and this has me balling my eyes out of not knowing what to do. I feel like i‚Äôm bed ridden for life. 

I randomly went from having a few PVCs a day to 1000+, like everyone else i have been in the ER multiple times, they take my blood and EKG and send me home. I did manage to get an Echo at the ER and it came back normal besides minor regurgitation or something. 

I have a suspicion mine are from my stomach and acid irritating my lower esophagus/diaphragm area. The bizarre thing is when i‚Äôm laying down i‚Äôll get 1 every few minutes, but after standing for a minute i‚Äôll get 10 a minute. Anytime i swallow food or water, i get them with a very high certainty. I also don‚Äôt feel much burning in my chest or throat like people with gerd, but just below the diaphragm it‚Äôs slightly uncomfortable. A burning/sharp pain occasionally when straining.

The reason i think it may be stomach related is it seems they started after straining pretty hard to pass a stool and also eating large meal right before bed. Each day for the last 5 days has progressively gotten worse and worse. I‚Äôm terrified. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can relate because of how strange it is that laying completely helps. Normally people with GERD have issues with PVCs when they lay down; not the opposite.

I started budgeting half-assedly at the beginning of the year, but it‚Äôs only until recently that I realized how much I was spending on coffee and, especially, fashion.
I was never in any credit card debt (only use it to buy groceries and large purchases I can already afford to get points for airlines), but still always dreaded opening my bank account to see how much I had dropped at the mall or on online purchases.

Honestly it‚Äôs a really no-frills process, I made a budget for groceries and started being more mindful about what I buy/buying stuff in bulk. That often requires trips to different supermarkets, but I am able to eat well and high protein. This alone saved me hundreds! Secondly, I set a hard cap at $200 a month for shopping. I try to space purchases out once a week so that I hit my weekly dose of dopamine for purchases but also stay in budget. If I get the urge to impulse buy, I‚Äôll set a timer and revisit the purchase in one week, and prioritize what I am really missing and try to buy second hand. 

The hardest part hasn‚Äôt really been the coffees or the clothes, but rather social settings. The city I live in doesn‚Äôt necessarily have good restaurants imho, but it‚Äôs common to get invited by friends to get dinner etc. I usually try to join right after for drinks, but it‚Äôs the one thing I have found the hardest to do.

Happy saving everybody!

----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to modern living, L-shaped barndominiums offer a unique blend of style and functionality. This layout allows homeowners to maximize their space while enjoying a contemporary aesthetic. The innovative design of L-shaped barndominiums can cater to various lifestyles, making them a popular choice for families, couples, or even individuals looking for a spacious yet cozy home.

One of the most appealing aspects of an L-shaped barndominium is the flexible living space it offers. The traditional design provides an open-concept floor plan with clearly defined areas for different activities. Whether you need a spacious kitchen, a comfortable living room, or a bedroom with an ensuite, an L-shaped layout helps in organizing these features effectively.

The separation of spaces in an L-shaped barndominium allows residents to enjoy both privacy and community. Here are some layouts you might love:

- **Open Layout:** This option combines the kitchen, dining, and living areas into one expansive zone. It‚Äôs perfect for entertaining guests or keeping an eye on kids while preparing meals.
- **Split Design:** Here, bedrooms are located in one wing of the L while the main living areas are housed in the other. This is ideal for families with children or anyone who values privacy.
- **Integrated Workspaces:** Combining a home office or studio into the layout can create a functional space for remote work or hobbies, ideal for today's work-from-home culture.
- **Outdoor Connection:** Many L-shaped designs include outdoor living spaces, such as patios or porches, creating seamless indoor-outdoor flow, which is perfect for gatherings or enjoying nature.

The efficient use of space in an L-shaped barndominium allows for impressive storage solutions. With clever design, you can integrate built-in cabinets, shelves, and hidden nooks without cluttering the overall aesthetic. Additionally, high ceilings can provide opportunities for vertical storage, allowing for more room to breathe.

When designing your L-shaped barndominium, consider the following key features to enhance your living experience:

- **Natural Light:** Large windows and skylights are essential in L-shaped layouts, bringing light into the home and making spaces feel larger.
- **Energy Efficiency:** With proper insulation and energy-efficient materials, you can create a comfortable living environment year-round that keeps utility costs down.
- **Modern Amenities:** smart home technology can elevate your living space, providing convenience and enhancing security.
- **Personal Touches:** Customize your barndominium with unique architectural features, sustainable materials, or personal decor to ensure your home truly reflects your style.

Another fantastic aspect of L-shaped barndominiums is their adaptability to various environments. Whether you're nestled in a pastoral setting, on a lakeside, or in a suburban neighborhood, this layout harmonizes beautifully with the landscape, enhancing its surroundings.

Building an L-shaped barndominium also allows for energy efficiency due to its design. With fewer exterior walls compared to traditional homes, less energy is required for heating and cooling. This can lead to significant savings on your energy bills over time, making it not just a stylish choice but a financially savvy one as well.

Additionally, as construction materials have evolved, many homeowners are opting for sustainable options that can further reduce their environmental impact. Using reclaimed wood, metal roofing, and eco-friendly insulation, you can design an L-shaped barndominium that is as gorgeous as it is green.

Every L-shaped barndominium layout provides an opportunity to express personal style while maintaining practicality. Whether you envision a light-filled family space, a serene home office, or a vibrant entertainment area, this modern design maximizes space and enhances your living experience. Discover the joys of L-shaped barndominium layouts‚Äîyou might just find the perfect fit for your lifestyle.

As you embark on your journey to create your dream living space, remember to take inspiration from various designs while tailoring it to your needs. An L-shaped barndominium offers flexibility, functionality, and fresh aesthetics that are sure to be a hit for years to come.

Maximizing Space and Functionality in Barndominium Designs
----------------------------------------------------------

Designing a barndominium is an exciting venture, particularly when it comes to maximizing space and functionality. The unique structure of a barndominium allows for a blend of rustic charm and modern comfort. The spacious interiors can be tailored to fit your lifestyle, ensuring every inch is utilized effectively. By layering in smart design elements, you can enhance usability while also creating a warm and inviting home.

One effective strategy is to implement an open floor plan. This concept integrates key living areas, such as the kitchen, dining room, and living space, into a single large area. By doing this, you create an all-encompassing environment that feels more spacious. Here are a few benefits of an open floor plan:

- **Improved Flow:** With fewer walls, movement becomes more fluid and natural.
- **Increased Light:** Natural light can penetrate further, resulting in a bright and airy atmosphere.
- **Engagement:** Family members can connect more easily during meal preparations or entertainment.

Choosing multi-functional furniture is another fantastic way to maximize the utility of your space. For example, consider investing in a sofa that doubles as a bed or coffee tables with storage compartments. This approach keeps your barndominium organized while providing additional function. Here are some furniture options to think about:

- **Expandable Dining Tables:** Perfect for hosting guests while saving space when not in use.
- **Foldable Desks:** Ideal for home offices, as they can be tucked away easily.
- **Storage Ottomans:** Great for additional seating and storing blankets or magazines.

Creating defined zones within an open layout can also help to maximize space. Use area rugs, furniture placement, or even color variations to distinguish different areas. For instance, a rug can demarcate the living area from the dining space. This technique gives a sense of structure within an open space, leading to better organization.

To enhance functionality, think about vertical space. Barndominiums often have high ceilings, making them an excellent candidate for tall shelving units or cabinets. Utilizing vertical storage not only makes it easier to keep things organized, but it also draws the eyes upward, making the space feel larger. A few vertical storage solutions to consider include:

- **Wall-mounted Shelves:** Perfect for displaying decor while keeping floors clear.
- **Overhead Cabinets:** These can be particularly useful in kitchens, providing additional storage without consuming floor space.
- **Loft Areas:** If allowable, adding a loft can create a cozy sleeping space or office.

Natural elements can also enhance both the aesthetics and functionality of your barndominium. Consider using large windows for natural light or incorporating biophilic design elements like indoor plants. Not only do these features improve visual appeal, but they also promote a sense of well-being within your living space.

Tech integration is essential for modern living. Smart home technologies can transform your barndominium into a highly functional space. With smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security, you can create an environment that adapts to your lifestyle. For instance, smart lighting can set the mood for entertaining, while smart thermostats can optimize comfort and energy savings.

Planning your layout around your lifestyle will lead to the most effective use of space. Are you an avid cook who loves to entertain? Make your kitchen a focal point with an island that provides prep space and seating. Do you have kids or pets? Designate an area for play that is visible from common areas. Considering your daily life will ensure that your barndominium meets your specific needs.

Whether you're at the design phase or ready to decorate, focus on maximizing both space and functionality. With thoughtful planning and the right choices, you can transform a barndominium into a stunning home that feels vast yet cozy, functional yet inviting. By following these tips, you‚Äôll create a living space that blends seamlessly into your lifestyle, making every moment in your barndominium a joy.

### Conclusion

Creating an L-shaped barndominium layout offers a unique blend of style and practicality that resonates with modern living. By embracing innovative designs, you can efficiently allocate space while maintaining a sense of openness and flow. The L-shape not only enhances aesthetic appeal but also provides opportunities for thoughtful separation of living areas, ensuring that family dynamics and social gatherings can thrive without compromising comfort.

When it comes to maximizing space and functionality, the versatility of these layouts shines. An L-shaped barndominium allows for dedicated zones‚Äîbe it for cooking, relaxation, or recreation‚Äîwhile still optimizing square footage. With careful planning, you can incorporate storage solutions, outdoor access, and even privacy features that elevate your living experience. As you design your space, consider how each area can serve multiple purposes, enhancing both utility and enjoyment.

Whether you envision a cozy nook in the corner filled with lush greenery or an entertainment area where family and friends can gather, L-shaped barndominiums cater to a wide array of lifestyles. This adaptable design not only reflects your individual taste but also offers a sustainable approach to home building, making it easier for you to embrace a modern way of life.

Ultimately, choosing an L-shaped barndominium layout combines functionality with creativity, resulting in a living space you will truly love. As you embark on your design journey, remember that your home should be a reflection of you‚Äîinviting, practical, and wonderfully unique.

1my7tmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1my7tmd/explore_if_tide_powder_detergent_really_beats/,Explore If Tide Powder Detergent Really Beats Tough Stains,"Tide 037000850052 has become a staple in my household laundry routine. I decided to try it after hearing about its powerful stain removal capabilities and refreshing scent, and after weeks of consistent use, I‚Äôve gotten an in-depth look at what it offers. From dealing with stubborn stains to keeping clothes vibrant, it‚Äôs been a bit of a game changer, though there are definitely some aspects to examine more closely before deciding if it‚Äôs right for your needs.  

**Powerful Cleaning Performance**  
What drew me to this powder detergent initially was its promise to tackle even 7-day-old stains, and it did not disappoint. I tested it on my kids‚Äô grass-stained jeans, an old coffee-stained shirt, and even some kitchen towels smeared with grease. To my surprise, the majority of the stains came out after just one wash, thanks to its Acti-Lift Crystals. It feels like this product was made for those tough laundry days when fabrics have been through the wringer. The HE Turbo technology particularly stood out since it not only cleaned thoroughly but did so even on quick cycles, saving both time and water.  

**Refreshing Scent of Mountain Spring**  
One of my favorite aspects is the lingering fresh scent it leaves on clothes. The Mountain Spring fragrance isn‚Äôt overpowering but has just the right balance to make my wardrobe smell clean and inviting. I‚Äôve noticed the scent lasts about a week, which is perfect for clothes that might sit in the closet for a little while. Even with my sensitive nose, I didn‚Äôt find the fragrance to be irritating or artificial.  

**Ease of Use in High-Efficiency Machines**  
With high efficiency (HE) washing machines becoming the norm, Tide designed this laundry detergent specifically for such systems. I used it in my own HE machine, and I never experienced any suds-related issues like with some other detergents. It dissolves entirely during the wash, leaving no chalky residue on fabrics or in the machine‚Äôs detergent compartment. I also appreciate that a small amount of powder goes a long way, making each box last for weeks.  

[Check Tide 037000850052 price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b00bzwujm6/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Exceptional stain removal, even on old, stubborn marks  
- HE Turbo technology ensures thorough washing in quick cycles  
- Long-lasting and invigorating Mountain Spring scent  
- Easy dissolution and compatibility with HE machines  

**Packaging Concerns**  
While the 143-ounce box provides excellent value, I did find the packaging a bit unwieldy. It‚Äôs a big box, and if you‚Äôre short on storage space like I am, it can feel cumbersome. Additionally, the box isn‚Äôt resealable once opened, so unless you transfer the detergent into an airtight container, there‚Äôs a chance of moisture seeping in and clumping the powder. It‚Äôs not a deal breaker, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning for anyone with limited room or high humidity.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Bulky packaging may not suit small laundry areas  
- Lack of a resealable lid exposes detergent to moisture  
- Powder may clump in damp conditions if not properly stored  

**Product Comparisons**  
I‚Äôve tried a fair share of laundry detergents over the years, from liquid varieties to other powder products like Arm & Hammer‚Äôs detergent. While both options clean well, Tide stood out for the sheer cleaning power it packed into quick cycles. This can save a lot of time compared to other products that require heavy-duty or repeat washes for similar results. However, I did notice that Arm & Hammer‚Äôs detergent has a lighter environmental footprint due to its biodegradable formula, whereas Tide‚Äôs packaging doesn't emphasize eco-friendliness as much. As for fragrance, Tide‚Äôs Mountain Spring scent outshines some competitors, but it might not appeal to someone who prefers fragrance-free alternatives.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
It‚Äôs priced a bit higher than some brands, but I think the number of uses you get from one box makes it worth splurging. You can use less detergent per load than most options, which balances the cost over time. For a family like mine, doing several loads a week, it performs impressively and justifies its price point. Still, budget-conscious families with smaller households may find cheaper alternatives more economical for their needs.

¬† Alright, bit of a long one here. If you‚Äôre the type who needs Subway Surfers running on split screen just to keep focus, this post probably isn‚Äôt for you lol. For everyone else, here‚Äôs the story of how I built my wall frame PC.

**Background story**  
¬† Back around plague time (Covid 2020), I was in touch with a mate who‚Äôs always been a big gamer. He had upgraded his rig and his old one was sitting unused. The thing is, this wasn‚Äôt just some random PC to him - it was his first proper gaming machine, something he worked hard to save for, and it meant a lot to him. Basically a relic.

He didn‚Äôt want it to be wasted or stripped for parts, but he also didn‚Äôt know what to do with it. At the time I wasn‚Äôt really gaming much myself, just using a laptop. It was fine for work and portability, but the integrated graphics held me back from playing anything newer and i felt sad that Deus Ex (one of my favourite series) wouldn‚Äôt be able to run properly.

So I made him a deal: I‚Äôd buy the rig for a friendly price, promise not to sell it on or gut it for parts for at least five years, and if he ever wanted it back for sentimental reasons, I‚Äôd hand it over no questions asked. He agreed, and I got the PC along with a monitor.

Fast forward a few years - I looked after this big a\*s prebuilt ROG machine ‚Äì big a\*s because it was inside Fractal Define XL R2 (the one with the crazy ‚Äúshotgun-proof‚Äù marketing stunt lol). The trouble was I really don‚Äôt like massive cases, and as you might know - in the UK homes space is often tight. The PC still ran fine for what I needed, but the time limit was up, meaning I could finally do something about it...

¬†

[CHUNKY Boy for comparison](https://preview.redd.it/0jokugnn0tkf1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6228f424736bc9d3c284bdac45f0e354f7df4f6)

**The hunt for an idea**  
¬† My first thought was just to shrink it down somehow.

* Maybe a smaller custom case.
* Maybe build it into some random object (I always remembered those mini rigs built inside Jack Daniels bottles - except obviously this one wouldn‚Äôt fit lol).
* Maybe stick it into one of those rounded-corner IKEA square shelves with perspex ‚Äì sadly (or thankfully) I could never get hold of the shelf.
* Thought about a table build - but didn‚Äôt have a nice table worth sacrificing.

Then I toyed with the idea of a picture-frame PC. But the more I imagined it, the more it bugged me. Either the parts would stick out of the frame (which I hated), or I‚Äôd have to use a very thick frame which defeated the point.

¬†

**The ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment**  
¬† While browsing other people‚Äôs DIY picture frame builds online, I stumbled across wall-mounted PC frames. Instantly I loved the concept - slim, tidy, visible, and space-saving.

But the reality? The ones on sale were ridiculous.

* ¬£300+ for a plain aluminium rectangle
* Oversized and universal, with loads of wasted space
* Industrial-looking, ugly, and not something you‚Äôd want hanging in your living room
* Clearly made for stuffing full of RGB strips and messy cables for ‚Äúgamer bling‚Äù

That wasn‚Äôt what I wanted. I wanted something slim, minimal, and futuristic-looking - not a giant industrial slab with RGB spaghetti vomit all over it.

So that‚Äôs when the challenge idea was born: build my own budget ¬£100 wall frame PC.

¬†

**Planning & wood hunt**  
¬† Once I settled on the wall frame idea, the next challenge was materials. The whole point was to keep it budget-friendly, not go out and buy fancy timber like I was building a designer coffee table...This was more of a ‚Äútrain the brain‚Äù project - a challenge to problem-solve with what I had or could scavenge cheaply.

The issue was weight and thickness. All the old furniture pieces I had were at least 1cm thick, which was too heavy and too chunky for what I wanted. My vision was a slim profile, almost flat against the wall.

Then pure luck hit. At work, my workplace was throwing out some old shelving. Not sure what you call this type of pressed wood, but the grain/dust mix they used was way finer than your standard chipboard. Best part? Only 6mm thick. Absolutely perfect!

I asked if I could take a piece - they said ‚Äúsure, no probs‚Äù. And just like that, the project got a huge motivation boost. Classic ADHD moment: as soon as I had the perfect material in my hands, my brain went into overdrive planning the whole thing - I have to be specific here - it took me around 4 months to constantly think about it whenever I had a chance to free the space in the brains for the project.

¬†

**Step 1 ‚Äì Layout & Measuring**  
¬† First things first: measuring everything. That was its own challenge because the PC was still in active use at the time - so it was a lot of awkward swapping around, but I‚Äôll skip the boring part.

Once I had the dimensions, I drew a basic layout directly onto the wooden board. Even in its raw state it looked good - the board already had a nice dark tone that gave it a solid vibe. But I knew I wouldn‚Äôt leave it bare. From the start, I wanted the whole thing to feel more ‚Äútech‚Äù and futuristic, not just ‚Äúhere‚Äôs some PC parts bolted to a shelf‚Äù and that‚Äôs where the idea to get a carbon fibre wrap - cheap, sleek, and tied in nicely with the whole Deus Ex inspiration (carbon fibre being the material used in augmentation) came in - but I‚Äôll expand on that later on.

At the same time, I was already thinking ahead about cable management, how I could bend/route things without snapping them, and how I‚Äôd eventually deal with the big Cooler Master block cooler that stuck out like a sore thumb.

¬†

[Measuring and Planning](https://preview.redd.it/a2y464yuhskf1.jpg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d759b9026c6d53a6e543ec2c8100786569a8be3)

**Step 2 ‚Äì Problem Solving**  
¬† While I was drawing and sketching, I was also actively hunting for solutions to all the problems I could already see coming.

* Cables - My first headache was figuring out how to ‚Äúbend‚Äù cables cleanly without actually damaging them. I wanted the whole thing to look neat, not like a snake pit.
* CPU cooler - The stock Cooler Master aluminium brick wasn‚Äôt going to cut it. It stuck out like a sore thumb, ruined the slim profile I was after, and just looked bulky.
* GPU - Mounting the GPU on a flat board? No chance with the standard slot. Thankfully I discovered PCIe extension cables - miracle solution. Suddenly it was actually possible to put the GPU where I wanted.
* PSU & cables -¬† The original PSU was a big a\*s non modular unit with way more wattage than I needed. Heavy, thick, fan ran loud - all the time with no control. I even considered desoldering unused cables to tidy it but that wouldn‚Äôt fix size or weight, and it would still stick the whole frame off the wall. After a lot of digging I found that the company who makes PSUs for brands like Corsair, Thermaltake, NZXT,Antec etc. Famous brands and while quite rare - they also sell their own OEM units. They had a model that ticked every box for this build - slim profile, modular, and hybrid 0 RPM fan mode. Exactly what I needed so the frame wouldn‚Äôt bulge out.

While searching around, I started discovering parts that made this whole project click together:

* L-shaped connectors - for the PSU, on both ends, which massively helped with cable routing.
* AIO liquid cooler - I hadn‚Äôt looked at liquid cooling in years, and last time it was all custom loops, refills, and maintenance nightmares. Finding out AIOs existed (all-in-one, sealed, and maintenance-free) felt perfect for this job.
* LEDs & controller - I wanted simple LED lighting to highlight the PC, but my old motherboard didn‚Äôt support it. After some digging, I found a cheap little controller that would handle it, and it looked decent too.
* Motherboard backlight - grabbed an LED frame that sits under the motherboard. It gave off a nice glow around the edge and also meant the board didn‚Äôt sit directly on the wood (even though it would eventually be vinyl-wrapped, I was still a bit paranoid about heat and grounding).
* Fancy PSU connector - I found a 24-pin L-shaped PSU connector with built-in addressable LEDs. Completely unnecessary, but it was another small ‚Äúcherry on top‚Äù.
* NVME heatsink - at this point the online shop algorithms started feeding me more ‚Äúshiny things‚Äù. I ended up grabbing an NVME heatsink with the same infinity mirror look as the AIO cooler - and yes, with ARGB. Had to get it.
* PCIe adapters - also picked up slim PCIe adapter for the extra NVME drive and I had one already lying around. No sense wasting them.
* SATA drives - I still had a spare SSD and NVME. Flat SATA cables worked perfectly for bending around tight spaces and hide these in the back, so I hooked those up too.

¬†

**Piece by piece, it felt like the puzzle was coming together.**

¬†

**Step 3 ‚Äì Style & Aesthetics**  
¬† Looks were a big part of this project. I didn‚Äôt want it to end up like the generic wall frames I‚Äôd seen online - plain aluminium, industrial, oversized, and ugly. Since it was going to hang on the wall, it needed to look intentional, not just like I glued computer parts to a board.

I went through a few ideas for the finish:

* Leather wrap imitation - would‚Äôve been unusual, but hard to make it look right.
* Brushed metal - nice in theory, but it risked looking cheap or tacky if not done perfectly.

Carbon fibre wrap - this one stuck. Cheap, sleek, and tied perfectly into the Deus Ex inspiration I kept coming back to. Carbon wrap won. Easy choice.

I didn‚Äôt stop there - I also wanted small details that would give it a bit of character without turning it into RGB vomit. While browsing online marketplaces, I stumbled across self-adhesive golden PVC furniture strips with a rounded edge. Dirt cheap. Instantly gave me cyberpunk vibes - specifically that flashy but stylised Neokitsch look (if you know, you know).

So I bought that too. The idea was to use it sparingly: to smooth rough edges, hide imperfections, and give subtle golden highlights without making it gaudy. Little accents that would act as the ‚Äúcherry on top‚Äù once the build was done.

¬†

**Step 4 ‚Äì Tools, Cutouts & ‚ÄúGhetto DIY‚Äù**  
¬† Once I had the board, the wrap, and a rough idea of placement, it was time to actually make space for everything. This is where the ‚ÄúDIY on a budget‚Äù part really showed.

My tools were‚Ä¶ limited. So some of the cutouts I made were definitely in full ‚Äúghetto mode‚Äù. Lots of frustration and a few questionable cuts later, I managed to carve out the areas I needed:

* Holes for screws where I knew components would need proper support (like securing the GPU).
* Cutouts for cable routing where absolutely necessary.
* Spaces for brackets, connectors, and airflow.

https://preview.redd.it/n3l6r39ciskf1.jpg?width=1014&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c809983cbf99b91521c13cee579e9896c6402eb

Then came the GPU problem. Mounting a GPU flat against a wooden board isn‚Äôt straightforward. I ended up improvising with random aluminium offcut I saved from an old TV repair attempt (one of those ‚Äúthis might be useful one day‚Äù boxes actually paying off).

https://preview.redd.it/dmmx9zbsiskf1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=996e0a752b673eade31abd29f2db7d1e625e4038

The great thing was these pieces already had raised threads in them, so they acted as ready-made mounting points. I cut them to shape, drilled matching holes in the board, and used longer screws plus washers to clamp everything neatly. Surprisingly solid solution for something so improvised. Before doing it for real tho I gave the GPU a full refresh. Repasted it and replaced every single thermal pad I could find with fresh ones from a mixed pack. I‚Äôm pretty sure this helped with the overclock later.

**Next issue: the GPU‚Äôs lighting and design.**

* The logo originally had a bright LED behind it (white/red glow) which I hated. Thankfully it was just a connector I could unplug - problem solved.
* One of the decorative plastic elements was red. Not part of my vision. Luckily it was attached with push clips, so I popped it off. But here‚Äôs where it got weird: I didn‚Äôt have any neat part to replace it with. So I grabbed wall filler (yes, the same stuff you patch cracks in plaster lol). I used it to flatten the shape, sanded it down smooth with fine sandpaper, and then wrapped it in the same carbon vinyl. Worked way better than it had any right to.

[\\""Ghetto DIY\\"" using filler so I could wrap it smoothly.](https://preview.redd.it/ql88zfr6jskf1.jpg?width=9288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bfd8a2b4285f7686ad20396fec1813e76c3bcc4)

The last awkward bit was the GPU connector. I bought an angled HDMI adapter, but it turned out to drop the refresh rate down to 60 Hz. My monitor can do 144 Hz, and I wasn‚Äôt going to lose that. So I had no choice but to use the bulky Dual-Link DVI-D connector instead. The cable itself could be ‚Äúgently‚Äù folded, but the connector block stuck out like a sore thumb. Solution? Wrapped the connector itself in thin leftover vinyl slices. It wasn‚Äôt perfect (the surface wasn‚Äôt smooth), but it blended in way better than I was hoping for.

**Step 5 ‚Äì Eeemotional Damage!**  
¬† So far things were going surprisingly well‚Ä¶ until the moment that nearly killed the whole project.

At one point when I had the CPU out of the socket, I managed to drop a screwdriver right onto the CPU socket pins. Yep. That heart-sinking, ‚Äúoh f\*\*\*‚Äù moment. I looked closer and could see something reflecting light weirdly - one of the pins looked bent. And we‚Äôre talking hair-thin, microscopic pins here.

In pure panic, I tried to just seat the CPU anyway and boot it. Nope. No joy. The error codes confirmed it: CPU not being detected properly. At that moment I thought the whole project was bricked. Months of planning, all the parts, and the one thing you absolutely can‚Äôt screw up had been ruined by my clumsiness.

Then I remembered I had a little USB hobby microscope lying around. Honestly, this thing saved the build. Under magnification, I could see the bent pin clearly. I spent the next two hours painstakingly nudging it back into place with the smallest, slowest movements possible - we‚Äôre talking nanometres at a time (I feel pain just thinking about it now lol) ‚Äì i was terrified it would just snap off.

Finally, after what felt like microsurgery, I slotted the CPU back in. Held my breath, pressed the power button‚Ä¶ and it POSTed. It actually worked!

The relief was unreal - I genuinely felt like a surgeon who had just resurrected Frankenstein haha. That one bent pin nearly gave me emotional damage for life, but somehow, it lived. At some stage here I also repasted the CPU properly using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme ‚Äì it was best one I could find at that point.

¬†

**Step 6 ‚Äì Final Touches & Cable Management**  
¬† With the major components mounted and the scary CPU surgery behind me, it was time for the little details - the part where neatness makes or breaks the look :)

* LAN cable - I didn‚Äôt want a big chunky cable sticking straight out. My first thought was to run a flat LAN cable directly under the motherboard. Problem was - what if I ever needed to disconnect it? Not viable.... I then tried an L-shaped extender, but the way it angled meant it stuck out even more. Finally, I found a slim extension cable. Routed it neatly under the board, between the LED backlight panel and the motherboard (tight fit, but it worked). In the end, only a barely-visible round cable sticks out, which I can live with.
* USB headers - I used angled USB connector to keep things tidy. For example, one tiny angled cable went to the little 3.5-inch IPS screen I added, which displays system stats. Another L-shaped connector went next to the LAN port and routed it in the same way, leading to a discreet 4-in-1 USB hub mounted on the wall just above the mouse. This hub is purely for keyboard/mouse and plugging in my FIDO security key when I‚Äôm working.
* Front panel audio - I salvaged an old front panel part from another PC case (with mic + audio + 2x USB) but I didn‚Äôt want those little pin bundles showing up like a bundled mess so I wrapped the cabling with the electrical fabric like tape to make it tidy and routed it through a small hole I drilled under the motherboard near the GPU. Invisible once in place
* Visible cables - For the few cables that had to be seen (like the 4+4 CPU power, PCIe 6-pin that vent into GPU and some headers), I wrapped them with the same fabric style electrical tape. It made them look like single clean cables instead of messy bundles of little wires :)
* Power button - Obviously I no longer had a case button. The motherboard‚Äôs built-in button was now blocked by the flat PCIe riser cables. Solution: I bought a small button that looked like a keyboard key. Routed it neatly and glued it behind the monitor stand. Now I‚Äôve got a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù power button hidden away but easy to reach :)
* PSU fan noise fix - The slim modular PSU was perfect, but its hybrid fan control kept throttling on/off (this started after I overclocked GPU and CPU), making annoying high-pitched spin-up noises. My fix? A tiny 40√ó40√ó20 mm fan blowing constantly across the PSU. Totally silent, and it stopped the PSU fan from what i would call - ‚Äúhunting‚Äù. Now it only kicks in under heavy load and stays consistent.
* Golden PVC accents - Finally, I used those golden PVC strips I‚Äôd bought. Originally for trimming the board edges, I ended up cutting leftover bits into small sections and sticking them around as accents: a strip along the left side of the motherboard, small offcuts around the LED controller, one along the PSU and even a couple of tiny pieces on the GPU and 24pin connector. Minimal touches, but it tied the whole thing together with that cyberpunk Neokitsch vibe.

All these little details were the finishing touches that turned it from ‚ÄúDIY PC parts bolted to wood‚Äù into something that actually looked like a proper design in the way I personally liked.

Step 7 ‚Äì Performance & Overclocking  
¬† After the frame was complete and all the cables hidden, it was finally time to see how well the cooling and all those tweaks actually worked. I knew very well that the components were ageing, so this was the part where I didn‚Äôt want to rush.

* Repasting & thermal pads - Earlier in the build I‚Äôd already repasted whatever I could so I was fairly sure this would make a difference once I started pushing clocks.
* AIO cooler - The affordable dual-fan AIO was the real game changer here. Compared to that massive Cooler Master aluminium tower, this not only looked cleaner on the wall but also gave me way better thermal headroom to actually overclock without cooking the chip and the temps are ideal 100% of the time.
* CPU overclock - Stock was 3.4 GHz. After loads of trial and error (and a few panicky restarts), I managed to get it stable at 4.4 GHz. That‚Äôs about a 33% uplift, and thanks to the fresh paste and AIO it stayed stable under extended stress testing. Max temps peaked around 77¬∞C¬† - which is pretty amazing considering the age of the silicon ;)
* GPU overclock - This was where the new pads + paste really shone. I built a custom VF curve and managed to flatline the core at around 1950‚Äì2000 MHz at the higher voltages. On top of that, I overclocked the memory by +485 MHz (\~9400 MHz effective). Anything beyond that gave me artefacts and benchmark crashes :( I dialled it back to this max stable point. I also set the power limit to 118%. ¬† result: 12-15% performance increase on the GPU, completely stable.
* System behaviour - With both CPU and GPU refreshed, the whole system ran smoother, quieter, and cooler. The PSU‚Äôs hybrid fan control did start properly at higher loads.

In summary:

* CPU: 3.4 -> 4.4 GHz (\~33% boost) with temps never exceeding 77¬∞C.
* GPU: +12-15% stable boost with custom VF curve + memory OC, no artefacts.

For what started out as a sentimental ‚Äúbig a\*s relic‚Äù in a bulky shotgun-proof case, it now runs like a modernised, wall-mounted cyberpunk machine - just the way I imagined it! :)

But can it run Crysis? Ops...wrong decade....It runs Cyberpunk at solid 60fps with AMD fidelity resolution on Quality. Almost everything is maxed - I‚Äôve had to nudge couple of shadow settings and volumetric clouds down a notch to get it stable 60 and I‚Äôm running quite a few mods, including a 2K texture pack - which just makes it look so much better :)

Pretty sure it's all down to the maxed OC and the fact I‚Äôm on a 1080p monitor - I honestly can‚Äôt tell 2K from 1080p anymore, probably getting old, no jaggies too. Only thing I notice is the odd fuzzy NPC hair now and then, not sure if that‚Äôs my settings or the game. Rest looks excellent to my eyes and I‚Äôm happy to skip ray tracing for now :)

**Step 8 ‚Äì Cost Breakdown & Closing**  
¬† Since this was meant to be the ‚Äú¬£100 challenge‚Äù, here‚Äôs the full breakdown of what I actually spent. Keep in mind:

* A lot of this was bought during sales or as bundle deals.
* Most of it was from China as I tried to eliminate middle-man costs and when buying from there the shipping is often half the price of the product ‚Äì so when bundling up products it ends up dirt cheap.
* A few things were completely free (scavenged wood, screws, nvme to PCIe card, usb cables, offcuts etc).

**Why post the whole saga**  
¬† I really miss seeing people experiment. Feels like we‚Äôve outsourced creativity to premade stuff and ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù buttons. This post is a reminder that you can upcycle, bodge, learn, fail, fix a bent pin under a microscope and end up with something you‚Äôre proud of!

If you‚Äôre not sure where to start, start small and start messy. You will figure it out on the way. If this post helps one person try, that‚Äôs the win.

**Quick disclaimer**  
I‚Äôm not a pro - just a hobbyist who loves problem solving. My day job has nothing to do with PCs or electronics at all. I learned most of this as I went along with manuals, forums and a lot of trial and error. I‚Äôm sure there are things I did wrong or could have done cleaner - that‚Äôs fine. The point is to try, learn, and improve!

**If you‚Äôre unsure, just start**

* Start tiny and accept it will be messy at first.
* Use what you already have and set yourself a budget rule.
* Sketch the layout or mock it on cardboard before drilling anything.
* Label cables, take photos before you unplug - trust me, keep screws in little bags. 
* ""Breadboard"" it first - get a clean POST before mounting.
* Power off at the wall, check clearances, avoid shorts, be patient with tools.
* Expect setbacks. Wrong parts, returns, bent pins - it happens.
* Share progress or make a journal like I did...ask the sub for tips. People will help if you show your work.

If this nudges even one person to try an upcycle or a weird budget build, that‚Äôs a win in my book.

I‚Äôll finish this with the quote:

1my7qk5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my7qk5,Updates on the alcoholic coke monster AirBnB guest/roommate,"All right, I'm back with updates on the alcoholic coke monster (32F, referred to as M henceforth). Honestly, the degree of investment you lovely people have showed has been lovely, even touching. 

To start, I am okay, I am safe, M is GONE, and at this point, I‚Äôm just sitting back and enjoying the comedy show she‚Äôs putting on for me and AirBnB‚Äôs support team. 

Strap in: this is a long one. Apologies in advance. 

**Police Contact Nothing Burger:**

Before evicting her, I went to my local police precinct for guidance. They told me they couldn‚Äôt do anything, as I can‚Äôt prove the drugs are hers, she hasn‚Äôt threatened me/my property, and I am not in clear and immediate danger. A lot of you were shocked I didn‚Äôt call 911 right away. Color me unfuckingshocked that my local precinct, which is NOTORIOUS for not doing their jobs, did not, in fact, do their job. I wish I could show you guys my local subreddit‚Äôs daily vitriol re: our precinct‚Äôs uselessness, but I‚Äôm not here to dox myself. Beyond the need to follow AirBnB policies to ensure reimbursement for potential damages, the NYPD was not my first choice because I knew they wouldn‚Äôt give a fuck that M was doing blow and made me feel unsafe. Lo and behold, no fucks were given. The officer I spoke with didn‚Äôt even let me file a report. I was advised to: 1) communicate in writing to M that I‚Äôm terminating her stay on X date and time; 2) call 911 if she refused to leave by said date/time and/or gets violent; 3) be sure to get her out in <28 days. I got her out 22 days into her stay, so any tenant rights claims are null and void. 

**My Decision to Temporarily Vacate:**

Y‚Äôall dragged my ass to hell for taking the free accommodations AirBnB offered, but let me explain my decision process. Until I sent the eviction notice, M had no idea that I reported her, that I went to the police, or that I even had a problem with her. She would remark how lucky she is because I‚Äôm so ‚Äúchill‚Äù and a ‚Äúpsychiatrist‚Äù she can use for ‚Äúfree therapy.‚Äù I am neither of these things. I‚Äôm an ABD clinical psych PhD student, which I told her many, many times. I also wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúchill‚Äù with her drug abuse/erratic behavior. I‚Äôm trained in crisis de-escalation and know the importance of being empathic and non-judgmental to defuse individuals in crisis. What she saw as ‚Äúchill‚Äù was me protecting myself while I formulated a plan.

Also, I know addiction. And I knew that I was in a dangerous situation with a woman in active crisis w/ untreated mental illness and multiple substance use disorders (SUDs), and my knowledge, training, and experience guided my interactions with her. After getting my MA in psych, I spent 5 years coordinating a study on comorbid SUDs and mental health d/os across 3 hospitals and detox units, where I assessed SUD severity and provided short-term tx intervention. As a PhD student, I have continued to assess and provide therapy for people suffering from addiction. Most of my publications focus on the short- and long-term effects of SUDs on mental health and neurocognitive function. I also know the dangers of confronting someone like M. In my work, I have been bitten, punched, kicked, and had my hair pulled, even in the presence of a crisis team. This is why I will always, ALWAYS prioritize my personal safety over *everything* else. Fuck my furniture, it‚Äôs replaceable (and reimbursable through AirBnb). This is why I got the fuck out. 

So, I took AirBnB up on their offer for free alternative accommodations. I was away until yesterday. I told M that I was going to spend a few days at my bf‚Äôs place. Her reaction was, ‚ÄúYAASS GIRL GET THAT DICK!‚Äù So, me packing a bag seemed normal. I also packed my meds, personal valuables, important documents w/ personally identifying info, etc. After I left, I dropped by the apt every day to assert a sense of normalcy for her and make sure everything was intact, under the guise that I was just picking up some things. We had normal (well, normal for M), friendly interactions every time. The only things I noticed were the overflowing trash cans and lack of toilet paper. I also had to come back bc she fucking locked herself out AGAIN, w/o her phone, keys, or wallet. She used a stranger‚Äôs phone to log into insta and call me via Instagram audio (MESS). I told her to call a locksmith with the phone, but ofc she couldn‚Äôt afford one. When I showed up (with my bf in tow), she was at a bar across the street, screeched with delight when she saw me, hugged me, and slapped me on the ass. This deeply uncomfortable reaction just reinforced my decision to vacate.  

**AirBnB is a Fickle Mistress:**

AirBnB has continued to drag their feet with the ‚Äúinvestigation.‚Äù I have gone full Karen on them. I‚Äôll post screenshots in the comments if any of you are interested, but it‚Äôs not the main point of this post. Essentially, they told me that I could cancel M‚Äôs reservation early if I felt like it, but they‚Äôll  have to continue their investigation to determine whether M will get a partial refund/if I‚Äôm eligible for property damage reimbursement. I was LIVID, did my own research, linked them to subsections of their own legal TOS page, highlighted relevant text, and encouraged them to review the information on their employer‚Äôs website, which clearly states that M is ineligible for a refund, given that she violated AirBnB policy & standards, my house rules, and federal law. Support took over 24 hours to respond, but they apologized to me for their mistakes and said that the information I provided was correct. 

Furthermore, AirBnB‚Äôs TOS delineate that M is responsible for retaliatory damage, and if she cannot/will not pay within 24 hours, AirBnB will reimburse me for deep cleaning costs, locksmith services (up to $500), and all incurred property damage, up to $3 million, as long as I provide accurate documentation. Oh, you want accurate documentation and receipts? You wanna fucking dance, AirBnB? You‚Äôre dealing with a bitch who has filled out countless reimbursement requests to the most byzantine bureaucratic piece of shit institution of all time (the office that manages my federal grant money) and is FILLED with home-protection rage. I don‚Äôt give a single shit if they push back or take weeks to reimburse me. I have been and will continue to be *relentless.* I will continue to educate AirBnB‚Äôs incompetent support team on their own TOS and gleefully provide them with the ever-growing body of incontrovertible evidence I have against M. 

**The Eviction Notice:**

I took up my local precinct‚Äôs advice to send M written notice of her eviction. Her ongoing responses to my notice are just a goddamn DELIGHT. They are simultaneously humiliating for her, corroborative of my claims against her, and just‚Ä¶ pure comedy. Check the attached screenshots. 

First, I blocked her phone number and blocked her on insta. Then, I used AirBnB‚Äôs messaging portal to send the notice. This way, they have full access to our communications. M, a 32 y/o adult woman, responded to my notice with all of the maturity and logic abilities of a 13-year-old. My favorite part? She supported my claims against her by saying, ‚Äúdid you also tell them ur dealer sold me addy and that you did blow with me?‚Äù and then IMMEDIATELY unsent the message. 

M, my sweet baby drug-addled girl, just because you can‚Äôt see the message anymore doesn‚Äôt mean that I didn‚Äôt see it. And it sure as fuck doesn‚Äôt mean that AirBnB can‚Äôt see it in perpetuity. My eviction notice clearly activated her fight-or-flight response. And she tried to fight (poorly). Bless her poor, overworked heart. She really thought she was doing something.

First of all, I didn‚Äôt even mention her persistent and pathetic requests for Adderall in the notice (though I did report it to AirBnB). The fact that she independently brought it up AND suggested that she participated in a drug deal (that never happened) is just the worst of looks for her. My decision to exclude Adderall from the eviction notice was calculated. I hoped she would implicate herself. And she did, in the most glorious of fashions. Also, hitting me up for Adderall is a secondary factor -- cocaine use on my property is MORE than sufficient grounds for eviction. Second, by accusing me of doing blow WITH her, she admitted to her own coke use, further supporting the photographic evidence I already sent to AirBnB (the cocaine vial, her coke ‚Äústraw‚Äù [aka a the top of a fucking TAMPON APPLICATOR; Note: I am still recovering from this breathtaking display of creative psychopathy], and the damage she did to my table with her innovative vaginal/nasal insertion tool). 

I know that my response to her seems odd in the contextual absence of her unsent message, but I was trying to highlight that: 1) getting her Adderall via a dealer makes NO logical sense when I have my own legal Rx and 2) there is a stark difference between what she was accusing me of vs. reality (pressuring me to sell her Adderall and do coke with her). I also LOVE that she kept referring back to her unsent message, as if she never deleted it. Just a gorgeous display of her child-like, drug-addled cognitive abilities. 

**M‚Äôs Reaction:**

Somewhat shockingly, she left. On time. Her keys were on the table. There was no need for police involvement. Perhaps even more shockingly, she didn‚Äôt incur any significant retaliatory damage beyond ripping off the window shades. The only missing items were a few white towels, which I noted were stained during one of my random apt check-ins this past week. She obviously threw them away. She even tried to clean! By ‚Äútried,‚Äù I mean she shoved the coffee table into the couch, vacuumed half of the living room, took out the kitchen trash, lined the can with the wrong bag, filled it with more White Claw, washed the dishes, got a single roll of 1-ply toilet paper, and did her best to scrub away the purple tampon applicator stains (they‚Äôre *mostly* gone, to her credit). That said, cumulative damage from her stay was immediately obvious, and she obviously didn‚Äôt follow check-out rules. The guest room‚Äôs sheets, duvet cover, and pillows are all fucking filthy and covered in unidentifiable reddish-brown stains. Unclear if period blood or self-tanner. 

Naturally, I took pictures and videos of everything and have hit her with over $500 in reimbursement costs (via AirBnB‚Äôs official forms) so far. She has declined every single request and reported ME to AirBnB. Fucking hilarious. I also have a deep cleaning service coming tomorrow because 1) coke use and 2) the bathroom and kitchen are fucking FILTHY. She may have washed the dishes, but there‚Äôs a menagerie of half-empty White Claws, rotting take-out food, and a concerning brown sticky substance all UP in my fridge. Guess who‚Äôs getting a $400 cleaning charge tomorrow? Y‚Äôall nailed it -- the financially insolvent coke addict. She obviously can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt pay, but AirBnB will. I also called a locksmith to change the locks and install new locks on both bedroom doors and submitted the receipt to AirBnB. I can‚Äôt change the building entrance lock because this is a multi-unit building, but I plan on getting a ring camera for my front door, as well as an outdoor camera for the fire escape to monitor who comes in/out. 

Honestly, at this point, my main concerns are the possibilities of her: buzzing every apartment in the building until someone lets her in, causing havoc in the lobby/stairwell, and/or stalking me. But hey, that‚Äôs what cameras are for. And the NYPD (allegedly). 

So, the majority of my M-related stress is dissipating, but obviously, she‚Äôs not going down without a coke-fueled fight. Her attempts at fighting me on AirBnB‚Äôs messaging platform over the past day have been a hoot. In a fascinating display of her underdeveloped and/or damaged frontal lobe, she demanded a $1,400 refund request from me. If she had actually read my fucking eviction notice, she would know that I can‚Äôt even issue her a refund. Her eligibility is dependent on AirBnB‚Äôs investigation, and, again, the evidence against her is in-fucking-disputable. Also, the amount she requested is BONKERS. My up-front payout from her stay was $1,455, and I allowed her to stay for 22/31 nights (~71% of the original booking duration). But you miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take, right? She can also go fuck herself because she owes me over $1,000 between the damages she incurred, the cost of deep cleaning, and the cost of the locksmith. We love a confident coke addict. May reparative neuroplasticity never find her substantia nigra. 

She was required to provide written rationale for her refund request, and her rationale is‚Ä¶ truly indescribable. I actually screamed in delight when I got the request. Clearly, she‚Äôs high as a fucking kite and completely unrestrained by the bounds of basic English language. Her garbled-ass ‚Äúrationale‚Äù is so deeply humiliating for her and so seamlessly corroborative of all of my claims against her (i.e., she is UNHINGED). In response, I politely read her for fucking filth. I could have gone so much harder on her, but as I need to retain my position as the sane one in this objectively insane situation, the less I say, the better. 

She didn‚Äôt even stop there. She lost her goddamn mind when I declined her refund request and hit her back with a barrage of evidence-backed reimbursement requests. In support of her ‚Äúcase,‚Äù she responded with pictures she took before she vacated, which include pictures of artfully arranged bedding (to hide the stains), the clean-ish table she ripped lines off of, and my linen closet (which includes stacks of towels). Bitch, just because I have a ton of other towels doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt fucking trash the ones you stained. 

M is an extraordinary woman. And I mean that in the worst fucking way possible. In the wise words of Rihanna, ‚Äúyour pussy is way too dry to be riding my dick like this.‚Äù 

I‚Äôll keep you guys posted on her ongoing spiral, as well as AirBnB‚Äôs ultimate decision. AirBnB actually just messaged me a few minutes ago, which I included in the attached screenshots. 

TL;DR: I‚Äôm more than okay, the NYPD was useless (as expected), temporarily vacating my apartment was the correct decision, I successfully evicted M, her current spiral is doing the most to corroborate my case, and I‚Äôm going to get my coins.",7,1755970612.0,badroommates,4,0.82,False

It felt a lot more serious than just a crush or passing attraction. But we both liked each other for years. But then 4 years passed from when we met.

I moved hours away to college because my mom had an addiction and home wasn't safe. He didn't know that's the reason I went. One night I was down for winter break, and he immediately out of nowhere said he'd be very down to see me. I wanted to say yes so badly, but was going back to school the next morning. I told him honestly that I'd love to but I don't live here anymore, I go to school in X city and don't have a car, no transit from home/school either which was all true, and I didn't think I could make it work right now, and I was really sorry. He said no worries but I'm scared he took it as rejection. It wasn't an excuse at all. I just didn't know how to make it work in a way that was fair to both of us and kept both of us safe from my mom who I was still so ashamed of.

It's been 10 years now and I'm finally able to move back safely. And I still want see him. He was always the only one I really wanted and that's not changed for me. My mom has passed away, I have a career, I've taken care of myself, there's nothing I need or want from him but him. I still want to reach out to him to see if he's at all around and interested in that coffee still. I know that when he asked me it wasn't casual based on our connection not being casual and his guardedness. I know/appreciate what it took for him to reach out that night like he did after 4 years of silence.

But it's been so long and his social media is dead - I can see he still goes online but he has changed his profile photo to a cartoon, hasn't posted anything in 10 years, no new photos with anyone, no tagged photos, no relationship updates, etc. I think he stayed in town and didn't pursue post-secondary but I have no real idea. I'm not sure if there's just not much going on with him or if he's just super private now.

I‚Äôve never been an orange blossom fan, so it didn‚Äôt win me over right away.

But patience paid off. As it settled, the sharp edges faded and the fragrance found its footing. The apple and cedar combo became crisp and smooth, touched by just enough lavender to soften the edges. There‚Äôs a whisper of coffee in the base‚Äînot enough to turn it gourmand, but just enough to add a subtle richness.

1my7k8o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1my7k8o,Arab tourists in Yerevan,"
I would say that we have great experience in Yerevan city 
We are Saudi couple traveling the world. In our last travel to Yerevan we had a nice experience compared to other cities. We admire the double personality the city had one at day time and another at night.
We were traveling with kids and during day time our activity was visiting city attractions and walking the beautiful main streets also trying to visit as much as local restaurants and coffee shops. During day my wife outfit is as any muslim lady ( hijab) and what I noticed which didn‚Äôt bother me at all. That she attract in many occasions other women eyes because of her hijab specially in Yerevan neighborhood. Write in the comments your perception about muslim tourists in Armenia.

Since we are open minded Arab. Me snd wife we present ourselves to city differently ( see the picture to see what i mean). We emerged ourselves into Yerevan night life. Wife is bearly covering her body and we are trying to show more than we hide. At night she was attacking men eyes which didn‚Äôt bother me at all. 
Let me highlight some points here and correct me if i am wrong.
At day time and since we present ourselves as typical muslim tourists in some places at the beginning they treat us cold without any smiles or hospitality. For example the first interaction with the waiter is cold but keeping our friendly and respectful manner the waiter approach change to be friendly and welcoming. Someone explain to me? Since it happens few times.
During night time while we are presenting ourselves as open minded couples we had beautiful interactions with people specially in restaurants bars and night clubs. We visited the gate club, 44 bar and calumet bar all experience was great. 
Usually when we are traveling and we randomly meet other couples we interact with them to test the water and to see if they are open minded. But in Yerevan we were hesitant maybe because as i read arminian is still conservative community.

The Mind-Bending Truth Behind App Testing Gateways (and My Weird Night Down the Rabbit Hole),"So, I fell down a digital rabbit hole last night and I‚Äôm honestly freaking OUT. 

You know those random ads where people claim you can MAKE MONEY clicking captchas? Like, who would pay you to solve robots vs. human puzzles? I laughed. I rolled my eyes. 

Now I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ not so sure. üò≥

Let me tell you what I found out, because my brain is doing backflips right now.  

----

**App Testing Gateways. Ever heard of them?** Because apparently, YOU CAN get paid to do simple human tasks‚Äîlike clicking captchas‚Äîif you test out new apps and platforms.

Here‚Äôs what I pieced together:

- App developers need ‚Äúproof of humanity‚Äù testers during soft launches.
- They‚Äôll funnel a RIDICULOUS amount of real people through their system‚Äîpaid by the click.
- Captchas are just a speed-bump on your way to testing cool stuff, from new games to wild productivity tools.

And, uh, they seem super desperate for human eyes‚Äîenough to toss actual CASH at you. But there‚Äôs a catch: ***which gateways are legit?***

ENTER: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

I kept seeing this site everywhere. Reviews screaming ‚ÄúIt ACTUALLY PAYS!‚Äù Naturally, I thought I‚Äôd get my email farmed and emptied out, but curiosity won.

---

So I signed up at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and WHAAAAAT.

- The first thing? Click a captcha to prove you‚Äôre not a robot. Standard stuff.
- Next? Browse through a list of apps looking for newbie TESTERS.
- Each assignment? A couple clicks, sometimes scrolling, rating, or **more captchas** (Is this peak internet, or what??)

Here‚Äôs the SHOCKER:  
They really *do* shell out micro-payments for these micro-tasks. Like, not get-rich stuff, but my coffee fund is alive and well.

‚Äî

So now I‚Äôm skeptical-hyped. Are apps just siphoning pennies from bots, or is this actually a genius side hustle nobody‚Äôs talking about? Is it sustainable? Is it safe? 

- The process takes like‚Ä¶ 1-2 minutes per app, TOPS
- It‚Äôs almost weird how easy it is (I expected spyware. I checked. Seems clean.)
- Direct payout options: PayPal, crypto, gift cards

I still can‚Äôt believe I just got a weird dopamine hit from solving Google‚Äôs click-the-crosswalk puzzles for CASH.

So here‚Äôs the burning question‚Äî  
WHO ELSE IS DOING THIS?  
Has anyone raked in solid pocket money, or is this some 3am fever dream I‚Äôll look back on with embarrassment?

Have you tried it?  
Did you get stuck behind those classic paywalls, or was it smooth sailing?

Let me know‚ÄîI need to know if I‚Äôm losing my mind!

And if you‚Äôre even a little bit curious (or bored, or like, ‚Äúhey, maybe robots *should* pay me for my human skills‚Äù), check out:

1my7fbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1my7fbj/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario/,Explore the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Hario PDA-02-T Worth It,"The Hario PDA-02-T caught my attention with its promise of simplicity, elegance, and improved coffee brewing control. Having used it daily for over a month, I can confidently say it brings a unique twist to pour-over coffee making. Hario is already a trusted name in manual coffee brewing, and this model reinforces the brand's positive reputation. Here's everything I‚Äôve learned and experienced.

**Simplicity in Design and Functionality**  
The clear, minimalist look of the Hario PDA-02-T is an instant win for me. Its clean aesthetic pairs beautifully with any kitchen setup, and it‚Äôs surprisingly compact, measuring just over 10 inches in diameter and almost 5 inches tall. Despite being lightweight, it feels solid in hand. The build quality ensures lasting durability, which is impressive for something I use daily. The drip-assist tool is the true star here, simplifying the brewing process for those of us who don‚Äôt own a gooseneck kettle. It evenly distributes water through varied hole sizes, ensuring consistent flow, and saves you from lugging around specialty equipment.

**Ease of Use: Perfect for Beginners and Beyond**  
One of the standout features of this model is its simplicity, making it approachable for coffee enthusiasts of all experience levels. If you‚Äôve always found manual brewing intimidating, this tool might be your perfect match. My mornings have become less chaotic‚ÄîI simply place it on any 02-sized V60 dripper, pour hot water into the central and outer rings, and let the drip-assist do the work. The guided brewing means no overpour mess or uneven extraction. It‚Äôs foolproof to the point that even my spouse, who‚Äôs less familiar with coffee brewing, managed to make a perfect cup without instruction.

[Check Hario PDA-02-T price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b08xbjnvqh/)

**Brewing Performance: Balanced and Reliable Results**  
I value consistency in my coffee, and this product delivers exactly that. The drip-assist rings feature multiple hole sizes, ensuring optimal water flow and preventing flooding of the filter bed. With 50-70ml of hot water in the center and the remaining in the outer ring, it‚Äôs clear Hario has designed this system for precision. The even saturation extracts aromatic oils and flavors effectively. Whether brewing a single cup for myself or a larger batch when friends visit, the results are always flavorful, rich, and smooth. It genuinely elevates the V60 brewing experience, and for more casual drinkers, there‚Äôs no longer a need to master a steady hand for pouring.

**Materials and Maintenance**  
The material used feels sturdy without being heavy, and the clear finish is easy to clean. A quick rinse under running water after each use prevents buildup, and the compact size makes it easy to store. Unlike some other brewing gadgets I‚Äôve owned, there‚Äôs no sharp curve or odd design element that traps water or coffee grounds. Even with continuous use, the matte exterior hasn‚Äôt shown a single scratch. For me, that‚Äôs a relief‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want my gear looking worn out too quickly.

**Highlights**  
- Simple drip-assist design eliminates the need for a gooseneck kettle.  
- Compact, lightweight, and durable materials make it easy to handle and store.  
- Ensures consistent water distribution for evenly brewed coffee.  

**Limitations**  
While I adore the product, there are a few aspects where it shows room for growth:  
- It‚Äôs not the quickest option if time is short‚Äîyou still need manual interaction.  
- Works with 02-sized V60 drippers only; not compatible with smaller or larger sizes.  
- Beginners will still need to understand water ratios for best results.

**Competing Products**  
While the Hario PDA-02-T holds its ground, the Chemex pour-over system and Kalita Wave stand out as strong competitors. The Chemex prioritizes batch brewing with a classic design, but it requires precision pouring or additional kettles. Meanwhile, the Kalita Wave focuses on even extraction using flat-bottom filters but lacks the guided approach provided by Hario‚Äôs drip-assist system. In comparison, the Hario option balances user-friendly convenience with consistent flavor extraction, making it more appealing for those seeking both simplicity and performance. However, don‚Äôt expect it to outpace drip machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster in terms of automation.

**Money's Worth**  
Considering its durable construction, reliable brewing consistency, and beginner-focused design, this product is great value for coffee enthusiasts on a budget. Sure, it may not replace fancy drip coffee machines, but it bridges the gap for those wanting barista-quality results at home without breaking the bank. The absence of a need for a gooseneck kettle further reduces set-up costs, making it accessible for everyday coffee lovers.

It sounds risky, even a little reckless. But when you look closely, many of those ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù actually become the ones who disrupt industries, build fresh ideas, and succeed in surprising ways.

The truth is, you don‚Äôt need to be an expert to start a¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/). In fact, coming in with zero preconceived notions can be an advantage‚Äîyou‚Äôre not bound by ‚Äúthe way things have always been done.‚Äù

What matters most is your willingness to learn fast, surround yourself with the right people, and stay persistent when things get messy.

If you‚Äôve ever thought about starting a¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†in a field you know nothing about, here‚Äôs how to actually do it‚Äîand not just survive, but succeed.

# Step 1: Shift Your Mindset From ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù to ‚ÄúExplorer‚Äù

When you step into an unfamiliar industry, you can‚Äôt pretend you know it all‚Äîand you don‚Äôt have to. Think of yourself as an explorer. Your job is to get curious, ask questions, and learn quickly.

Instead of feeling insecure about what you don‚Äôt know, see it as a chance to build a fresh perspective. Some of the biggest breakthroughs happen when someone looks at an industry from the outside and asks, ‚ÄúWhy is it done this way?‚Äù

**Action tip:**¬†Start with research, but don‚Äôt stop at¬†[Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†searches. Read industry reports, listen to podcasts, and join¬†[online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†communities where practitioners hang out. The more voices you expose yourself to, the faster you‚Äôll understand the landscape.

**Get Started**¬†‚Äî¬†[**bit.ly/systemeioaffiliatez**](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)

# Step 2: Identify Problems Before Products

It‚Äôs tempting to jump straight into creating something. But before you pick a product or service, take time to understand the problems people actually face in that industry. Businesses succeed when they solve real problems‚Äînot just when they sell something flashy.

For example, if you‚Äôre starting a coffee shop without ever working in one, don‚Äôt obsess over the menu right away.

Spend time observing what frustrates customers in other shops. Is it the long wait times? The lack of comfortable seating? The confusing loyalty programs?

**Action tip:**¬†Talk to potential customers. Ask open-ended questions about their frustrations. Your lack of expertise can actually make your questions more genuine‚Äîyou‚Äôre not stuck assuming what matters.

# Step 3: Learn the Language of the Industry

Every industry has its own shorthand, inside jokes, and acronyms. If you don‚Äôt understand the basics, you‚Äôll always feel like an outsider.

The good news is, you don‚Äôt need to be fluent overnight‚Äîyou just need to learn enough to hold conversations and make smart decisions.

**How to learn quickly:**

* Read beginner-friendly guides and glossaries.
* Follow industry experts on LinkedIn or Twitter.
* Ask ‚Äúdumb‚Äù questions early. It‚Äôs better to ask now than make costly mistakes later.

I once had a friend who jumped into real estate without knowing what ‚Äúescrow‚Äù meant. Instead of pretending, she asked every agent she met until she fully understood. That humility saved her from legal headaches down the road.

# Step 4: Borrow Expertise Instead of Building It All Yourself

You don‚Äôt need to become an expert in every part of your new¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)‚Äîyou just need to know how to find the experts.

Think of yourself as a conductor. The musicians (your team, contractors, advisors) bring the technical skill. Your role is to guide, coordinate, and make sure the music sounds good together.

Ways to borrow expertise:

* **Hire smart:**¬†Bring in people with experience you don‚Äôt have.
* **Find mentors:**¬†Many seasoned professionals love to share their knowledge if you show respect and genuine curiosity.
* **Partner strategically:**¬†If you‚Äôre starting a food business but know nothing about supply chains, partner with someone who does.

# Step 5: Start Small and Test Quickly

When you‚Äôre new to an industry, it‚Äôs easy to waste time perfecting things before testing them. Don‚Äôt. The longer you delay, the more you risk building something nobody wants.

Instead, run small, cheap experiments. If you‚Äôre starting an¬†[online](https://tchelete.com/most-profitable-online-businesses/)¬†store, launch with five products, not fifty. If you‚Äôre opening a service¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), try offering a pilot version to a few clients first.

Testing keeps you from betting everything on assumptions. You‚Äôll learn what works‚Äîand just as importantly, what doesn‚Äôt‚Äîbefore it costs too much.

# Step 6: Build Credibility Along the Way

One of the hardest parts of starting a¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†in an industry you don‚Äôt know is earning trust. Customers, suppliers, and even employees may wonder, ‚ÄúWhy should we take you seriously?‚Äù

You build credibility by showing commitment and delivering results, not by pretending you know everything. Share what you‚Äôre learning. Celebrate small wins. Be transparent about the journey. People respect honesty more than forced expertise.

Over time, your consistency will outweigh your lack of background.

# Step 7: Stay Resilient When Things Get Hard

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîit will be harder than you expect. You‚Äôll feel overwhelmed. You‚Äôll make mistakes. Some people may even doubt you out loud.

But this is where persistence pays off. Success rarely comes from having all the answers upfront. It comes from staying in the game long enough to figure things out.

I like to think of it this way: the first year in a new¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†is less about ‚Äúwinning big‚Äù and more about ‚Äúnot giving up.‚Äù If you can survive the messy middle, you‚Äôll put yourself in a position to thrive later.

# FAQs

# Do I really need experience in an industry before starting a business?

No. Experience helps, but it‚Äôs not the only path. What matters more is your ability to learn, adapt, and find people who complement your weaknesses.

# How do I avoid looking like an amateur?

Be honest about what you don‚Äôt know, but back it up with action. When people see you putting in the work, asking smart questions, and delivering on promises, they‚Äôll respect you‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre new.

# What if I completely fail?

Failure is possible, but it‚Äôs also one of the best ways to learn. Many successful entrepreneurs failed in their first few businesses. The key is to take what you learn and apply it next time.

# Isn‚Äôt this too risky?

Any¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†is risky. The real risk isn‚Äôt starting something you don‚Äôt know‚Äîit‚Äôs refusing to learn as you go. If you stay curious and adaptable, you reduce that risk every step of the way.

# Final Thoughts

Starting a¬†[business](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/)¬†in an industry you know nothing about can feel intimidating, but it‚Äôs far from impossible. In fact, your lack of experience might just be your biggest asset if it helps you see opportunities others overlook.

At the end of the day, you don‚Äôt need to know everything‚Äîyou just need to know how to learn, how to ask for help, and how to keep going when it gets hard.

1my77m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1my77m8/reveal_the_best_drip_coffee_machine_breville/,Reveal the Best Drip Coffee Machine Breville Precision Brewer Worth It?,"The Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 Precision Brewer quickly became a staple in my morning routine, and as someone who can‚Äôt function without a good cup of coffee, let me just say it came with high expectations. I've had my fair share of coffee makers, from the basic drip machines to fancy espresso gadgets, but this one stands out in more ways than one. It‚Äôs not perfect, though (we‚Äôll get to that), but there‚Äôs a lot to unpack about this brushed stainless steel beauty with its sleek design and promise of ‚Äúprecision‚Äù brewing.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing you‚Äôll notice is the aesthetic appeal. The brushed stainless steel finish is not only attractive but exudes durability. It‚Äôs modern without being too flashy, fitting perfectly into most kitchen designs. At 6.7 inches deep, 12.4 inches wide, and 15.7 inches high, it‚Äôs more compact than it looks in pictures. Despite this, it packs a lot under its hood. The glass carafe is a nice touch and gives a sense of quality compared to cheaper plastic alternatives. However, I found myself being extra cautious to avoid chips or cracks ‚Äì it's glass, after all.

**Features That Impress**  
I was immediately drawn to the six distinct brewing presets. Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew ‚Äì how customizable can one coffee maker get? I extensively tested each setting because, well, I‚Äôm that person who has different coffee moods. The Gold setting, which adheres to the SCA‚Äôs (Specialty Coffee Association) gold cup standard, delivered a consistently clean and smooth brew. For iced coffee lovers like my teenager, the cold brew setting is a win since it‚Äôs foolproof. 

The ‚ÄúMy Brew‚Äù setting is arguably the most impressive. Bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate? It‚Äôs essentially the Tesla of coffee makers, giving you complete control. My inner coffee geek was thrilled, though I‚Äôll admit, not everyone in the household has the patience to play with it. If you just want to press a button and not think, the other presets will save the day.

**Upsides**  
- Automatic temperature and brew time adjustments ensure consistency.  
- Dual filter baskets (flat-bottom and cone) give brewing flexibility.  
- Excellent versatility with pour-over adapter compatibility.  
- The Thermo Coil Heating System ensures purer water compared to aluminum heating systems.  

[Check Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b07dmbyh4s/)

**Pitfalls**  
Every great product has its quirks, and this coffee maker isn‚Äôt exempt.  
- It‚Äôs on the heavier side, weighing about 9.5 pounds. Moving it for cleaning or storage isn‚Äôt the easiest.  
- The inability to store preset customizations for multiple users can be inconvenient if you're not the sole coffee enthusiast in the house.  
- I wish the cone filter basket felt slightly more robust; it doesn‚Äôt inspire as much confidence as the rest of the machine.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Performance-wise, you get what you pay for. The precise digital temperature control (PID) keeps the water in the 197 to 204-degree range, hitting that sweet spot for optimal coffee extraction. The brew strength options were great too, especially for guests who prefer a stronger cup than my usual mild blends. The Steep and Release technology holds water in contact with the coffee grounds for smaller volumes, which means no watered-down taste ‚Äì a feature I didn‚Äôt realize how much I needed until I used it. For batch brewing, it does a fantastic job, but for single-cup brewing, it wasn‚Äôt as fast as I hoped.

**Competing Products**  
The Breville Precision Brewer sits in a crowded market with some serious contenders. Machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the OXO Brew offer similar functionality. The Technivorm stands out for its straightforward functionality and longevity, with a fully manual design that some purists love. However, it doesn't hold a candle to the precision and programmable features this offers. OXO Brew, on the other hand, is cheaper and offers thermal carafe options, which are great for retaining heat. The decision comes down to personal preference: do you want simplicity or customization?

**Financial Value**  
When you consider the phrase ‚Äúyou get what you pay for,‚Äù this coffee maker delivers in spades on quality and customization. While it's not the cheapest machine out there, it doesn't feel overpriced for what you‚Äôre getting. Essentially, it's for those willing to invest in personalized coffee experiences, though casual drinkers might find a cheaper alternative adequate.

Welcome to your unofficial guide to life at Cambridge Institute of Technology, Bengaluru!
üè† Hostels & Rooms
When you arrive, the campus will be a beehive of activity. Ragging isn‚Äôt a concern, but expect seniors to be a bit distant initially due to college rules.
 * Boys are usually placed in the on-campus CIT Boys Hostel.
 * Girls get accommodation in the nearby CIT Girls Hostel.
 * Rooms are generally 2‚Äì3 sharing and come with basic furniture like a cot, table, chair, and cupboard (Trust me Girls Hostel is way better than Boys).
 * WiFi is available, no LAN connection So more stable connection use 5G.

üëï What to Pack
 * Bangalore weather is famously unpredictable‚Äîit can go from sunny to rainy in an hour! Carry light cottons, a jacket or hoodie, and a compact umbrella.
 * Don't forget bedsheets, a laundry bag, and a few extra clothes hangers.
 * Essentials like buckets, mugs, and basic utensils can all be bought from shops right near campus, so no need to haul them from home.

üç¥ Food (Veg/Non-veg)
 * The hostel mess is what you‚Äôd expect (mostly rice, sambar, veggies and curries), but you‚Äôll soon find yourself exploring the campus canteen, nearby fast-food joints, or Swiggy/Zomato.
 * The night canteen is your absolute savior for late-night cravings like Maggi and coffee.
 * A small kettle for hot water is a lifesaver. Just be sure to keep it under 1kW to avoid getting in trouble during hostel checks.

üö≤ Getting Around If you‚Äôre a day scholar 
 * A cycle or scooter will make getting around much easier, especially for trips to nearby shops or eateries.
 * Many students also rely on Rapido or Uber autos for quick, short distances.
 * The campus itself isn‚Äôt huge, so walking is perfectly fine for getting from your hostel to classes.

üìö Academics & Placements
 * The labs are well-equipped, with CS/IT branches often having better exposure than core branches.
 * Placements are consistently improving, with average packages of 4‚Äì5 LPA for CSE/ISE/AI-ML. Companies like Infosys, Accenture, and TCS are frequent visitors. Some students also land higher packages (10‚Äì20 LPA) from product-based companies.
 * Having a laptop is basically mandatory for coding, projects, and online tests.

üõ†Ô∏è Essentials You‚Äôll Thank Yourself For
 * A sturdy lock for your room.
 * A broom, rag cloth, and basic cleaning supplies (trust us, it'll get dusty).
 * A first aid kit with essentials like paracetamol, Cetirizine, ORS, and antiseptic.
 * And please, deodorant üòÖ‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthat‚Äù roommate.

‚ö†Ô∏è Rules & Warnings
 * Induction cookers, heaters, and hair dryers above 1kW are not allowed, and hostel wardens do conduct occasional checks.
 * Smoking and alcohol are strictly banned inside the hostels.
 * Hostel WiFi can get slow during peak hours, so many students use a separate mobile data plan for backup.

I‚Äôm exploring an idea for a new service in Dublin city centre: a¬†**secure indoor hub for e-bikes and e-scooters**. The idea is that you could pay by the hour to park your bike/scooter safely inside, with charging points available and maybe even a small coffee dock.

I‚Äôve put together a quick survey (10 questions, takes 2 mins) to see if people would actually use something like this:¬†[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduLrGmD9Jvmsiz4zfF4dHh7ekUC\_KCXQyGhFZk11q78YSxaA/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduLrGmD9Jvmsiz4zfF4dHh7ekUC_KCXQyGhFZk11q78YSxaA/viewform?usp=dialog)

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts ‚Äî especially on:

* Would you pay for safe indoor parking?
* What feels like a fair price?
* Would charging and a coffee spot make it more attractive?

1my733g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1my733g/raw_and_real_something_worth_building_if_there_is/,"Raw and real, something worth building if there is mutual love, respect, communication, devotion and effort","""Love isn‚Äôt always perfect, because people aren‚Äôt perfect. It is not a spell that fixes our flaws or paints every day in soft light; it is the decision to stand beside someone even when the light is harsh and the truth is plain. Some days it is the spark that makes your chest rise with hope; other days it is the quiet breath you take so you don‚Äôt say something you will regret. Love survives on small, ordinary choices made again and again, because not every moment is a grand declaration. In between the big days and the photographs lies the real work of the heart, the slow stitching that holds two lives together when the world tries to pull the seams apart.

It isn‚Äôt a fairytale or a storybook with neat chapters and perfect endings. There are drafts and rewrites, margins full of crossed-out lines, and sentences you wish you could take back. There are characters who learn too slowly and nights when the plot does not make sense. Sometimes the villain is fear, and sometimes the villain is your own tired temper. But love keeps the pen moving, because you both believe there is a way to write a better paragraph tomorrow.

It doesn‚Äôt always come easy, and that is not an insult to love but a tribute to its depth. The best things we build require effort, and love is a structure you raise with trust as the foundation and forgiveness as the beam that runs through every room. There are days when you lift more than you thought you could, and days when you need someone to hand you water and say, ‚ÄúRest here; I‚Äôve got this side.‚Äù Love lets the stronger carry the load without keeping score and lets the weary admit they need help without shame. It is a shared endurance that makes even the hard ground feel like home.

Love is overcoming obstacles, not because you enjoy the struggle, but because the person at your side is worth the climb. You break rock with kindness, you loosen knots with patience, you cross old bridges carefully and build new ones with nails called honesty. When storms come, you do not leap from the boat; you tighten the ropes and learn to read the wind together. You learn that two hands on the same oar make the river less frightening. You learn that holding on is not stubbornness; it is a sacred promise.

Love is facing challenges that do not ask permission to enter your lives. Lost jobs, late calls from the doctor, the ache of distance, the silence that follows a harsh word said in a moment of panic‚Äîeach arrives uninvited. But love answers the door together. You speak softly in waiting rooms and loudly when you need to advocate for each other. You become fluent in the language of ‚Äúwe,‚Äù even when ‚ÄúI‚Äù still feels safer. In time, you find that courage grows when it has company.

Love is fighting to be together when everything around you says it would be easier to walk away. You choose each other in the middle of misunderstandings, not just after you‚Äôve sorted them out. You argue cleanly when you can, and when you fail, you apologize like you mean it, not like you are trying to win. You learn that winning in love is not about being right but about being here. You remind each other that distance is a geography problem, not a heart problem.

Love is holding on and never letting go, and sometimes that grip is a fierce fist, and sometimes it is a gentle hand. You tighten when anxiety tells you to run, and you loosen when closeness begins to feel like a cage. You hold in a way that makes room for the other person to breathe. You do not hold them in place; you hold them in trust. You learn that love can be both a shelter and a horizon.

It is a short word, easy to spell, and somehow it grows larger every time you say it. You say it on good mornings and bad days, in grocery aisles and traffic jams, with flour on your fingers and tears in your eyes. You say it as a promise before sleep and as a prayer when you wake. You say it into the phone as a lifeline across miles, and you say it across a table as a bridge over old wounds. Each time, it gathers history and becomes heavier with meaning.

Love is difficult to define because it changes its shape to fit the moment. It is the blanket over cold feet, the call you return even when you are tired, the grace you give when you have every reason to be sharp. It is the truth spoken gently and the silence kept wisely. It is sometimes the courage to say ‚Äúno,‚Äù and sometimes the strength to say ‚Äúyes.‚Äù It is not a single sentence but a living conversation.

Love is impossible to live without once you have tasted its quiet miracles. After the first time someone lifts your chin and calls you home with your name, you realize how empty the echo sounded when you were alone. You learn how a body can be sanctuary, how a laugh can dissolve fear, how a steady presence can change the color of a room. You discover that your own heartbeat has been waiting for another rhythm to fall into step with. You wonder how you ever measured time before this.

Love is work, and the work is deeper than flowers and anniversaries. It is the unglamorous care: the dishes when the other is late, the text that says you‚Äôre safe, the hand on the back in a crowd. It is learning how they take their coffee and how they take their pain. It is remembering who they were before you and honoring who they are trying to become with you. It is the labor of seeing, really seeing, and wanting to keep seeing, even on the messy days.

Love is endurance, not as a grim march but as a shared rhythm that finds its way even when the music changes. You invent dances no one else will understand: the way you lean in at the same joke, the way you reach for the door in the same motion, the way your steps quicken together when rain starts. You trust that when you stumble, a hand will be waiting. You accept that sometimes the other will stumble too, and your hand must be the steady one. This is how two people learn to move as one without losing themselves.

Love is forgiveness that opens the window after a storm. It lets in fresh air without pretending the room never flooded. It remembers the lessons and still chooses softness. It keeps the ledger of hurt from becoming the map of your future. It believes you can do better because it has seen you do better and wants to see it again.

Love is the courage to sit with silence until it turns honest. Not every quiet is distance; sometimes it is healing. You hold each other without words and trust that the heart is speaking in a language older than sound. In the long hush after a hard day, you let your breathing align. You discover that togetherness is not a noise you make but a presence you share.

Love is showing up in the ordinary, because that is where life happens most. Grocery lists, laundry piles, gas tanks, tired feet, and the evening light bouncing off the same wall‚Äîthese are the rooms where your devotion learns to breathe. The small routines become a shelter against the rush of the world. You become each other‚Äôs familiar, the face that soothes even when nothing else is simple. In the ordinary, love proves its strength by refusing to be bored.

Love is memory, and memory is the thread that keeps your heart from unraveling on the hard days. You keep stories in your pocket‚Äîthe first awkward smile, the first road trip, the time you danced in the kitchen with socks on and nearly fell. When fear says, ‚ÄúThis is too much,‚Äù memory answers, ‚ÄúWe have done hard things together.‚Äù You pull those moments like beads and let them click in your fingers. Each one says, ‚ÄúKeep going.‚Äù

Love is also making room for grief, because life does not spare the tender. There will be losses that bend your backs and news that knocks the air from your lungs. You will learn to hold each other in hospital chairs and on unmade beds. Love will sit beside pain without trying to fix it, will bring water and a soft shirt and the courage to let tears come. And somehow, in the middle of the ache, the quiet weight of a familiar hand will say, ‚ÄúYou are not alone.‚Äù

Love is becoming teammates in the slow tasks that change everything. Budget talks at the kitchen table, the decision to forgive a family member, the plan for a future that might look different than you imagined. You build a life from pencil marks on a calendar, recipes kept and altered, and notes left on the fridge when schedules don‚Äôt align. With each small agreement, trust deepens. With each compromise, you carve out a space where both can breathe.

Love is choosing, again and again, even when choosing costs you something. You choose patience when anger would feel better for a moment. You choose truth when hiding would be easier. You choose to stay curious when assumptions could harden into walls. You choose to risk your heart when you could keep it safe and lonely. And in return, you are chosen, not because you are flawless, but because you are known.

Love is time, not just the grand sweep of years but the sacred minutes that turn into a life. It is the way you watch each other age with gratitude rather than fear, gathering the silver in hair like threads of moonlight. It is learning new versions of each other without letting go of the original song. It is birthdays with simple cakes and sunsets watched without photographing every second. It is the miracle of looking up decades later and seeing the same eyes, wiser and still bright.

Love is trust that grows like a tree‚Äîslow, rooted, and sheltering. It does not leap from seed to shade overnight. Wind tests it, seasons change it, and time thickens its rings. You tend the roots with honesty, you water it with attention, you prune what must be trimmed so new growth can come. And one day, you sit beneath it together and realize you built a place to rest.

Love is realizing that every hour, every minute, and every second was worth it because you did it together. You count the hard nights and the easy mornings and find that they add up to a story you could not have written alone. You trace the scars and call them maps back to each other. You look across the table, or across the room, or across the years, and feel a rush that is not the first spark but the steady fire that warmed you through it all. You whisper thank you to the past, courage to the future, and I am here to the present.

Love, in the end, is not perfect. It is real. It is the softest place you have ever fallen and the strongest bridge you have ever crossed. It is the work that saved you from becoming only yourself, the music that changed your stride, the light that stayed on when the rest went dark. And if tears come as you think of what you have survived and what you have made, let them fall. They are proof that your heart learned how to stay.""

A couple months ago, I was running late for work and didn‚Äôt do my usual Starbucks run. I decided to grab coffee at some random little caf√© I‚Äôd never been to before closer to work. The place was small, cozy, and smelled like fresh pastries.

I ordered my drink and when I reached for my wallet, I dropped all my change everywhere. Smooth, I know. That‚Äôs when she stepped in. A stranger knelt down, helped me pick up my coins, and smiled like it wasn‚Äôt the most embarrassing moment. She made a joke about ‚Äúcharging me a fee for helping me,‚Äù and for some reason, that broke the tension.

We ended up chatting while waiting for our drinks. She was an illustrator working on a children‚Äôs book. I‚Äôm in Construction, so our worlds didn‚Äôt really overlap, but somehow the conversation felt easy. Before leaving, I almost chickened out, but she surprised me and said
‚ÄúHey, I come here a lot. Maybe I‚Äôll see you around again?‚Äù

I did see her again. And again. And after a few more accidental (and then not so accidental) coffee meetups, I asked her on an actual date. She said yes.

Fast forward to now, and I‚Äôm sitting next to her on the couch as I write this. We still go to that little caf√© almost every week. It‚Äôs wild how life can completely change over one random cup of coffee.

PLEASE (headaches and severe fatigue),"**I am sorry in advance that this is long but want to give detail. If you do read this whole thing THANK YOU.  I really appreciate anyone who has advice for me about what might be happening.**

I am looking for scientific articles or someone with a deep understanding of what might be going on, or feedback from people who have experienced what I am experiencing. I am getting desperate.

**Back story:** diagnosed with hpylori after an acute attack of upper epigastric pain (for about a week) and nausea (for a few months, worse in the morning, some vomiting). I have had stomach issues (gas, pain etc) most of my life so wasn't too surprised. About 2.5 years ago, had EXTREMELY stressful experience that basically required me to leave work and get mental health treatment. 2 years prior to that, I went through a stressful divorce, moved, and went through empty nest. I have had a lifetime of depression and anxiety but this was FAR worse. (Stress background may be relevant so including it here).

**Treatment:**  Went on triple therapy treatment for 10 days end of June through 6th of July. By day 7 of treatment began to get throbbing, pulsating ""headaches"" (I put that in quotes because it wasn't exactly pain but more like dizziness and severe fatigue with pulsing waves of whooshing in head). Didn't want to take NSAIDS and tried Tylenol to no effect. I figured it was due to destruction of gut bacteria from triple therapy and that it would pass. Began taking probiotics (rhamnosus, boulardi, reuteri and BioGaia Gastrus) daily. Ate very clean, vegetarian, took supplements B vitamins particularly.

**Two weeks post-antibiotic** still having near-continuous throbbing in head and fatigue. Had a Toradol IV (migraine medication) to zero effect. Then was prescribed sumatriptan (zero effect). Was very careful with diet, and eliminated kefir and kombucha, which I had been taking for my stomach, thinking perhaps it was too much.

**Three days** ago started a low-histamine diet which I am still playing around with. Had 2 good days and was like ""HURRAH!!"" and then Wednesday felt bad again. Decided to eliminate coffee and try black tea (wasn't willing to eliminate caffeine yet if it wasn't necesary) and still not feeling better. I order DAO (helps modulate histamine production) but have only tried twice and only after food. Friday (yesterday) had nausea and vomited three times about 4 hours post breakfast (oatmeal and oatmilk with flax and blueberries). I haven't had nausea post treatment so that was very weird.

**This morning:** woke up with bad headache and had some low-histamine cereal with milk (not oat milk, which I had been using). No tea or coffee. Still had a bad headache 4 hours after awakening and finally gave in and took Excedrin Migraine which has helped in the past (taken it perhaps 6 times when things are awful) but obviously contraindicated for stomach issues as contains NSAIDS including aspirin. Other NSAIDs have done nothing. Now an hour later headache is about 50% better but still awful fatigue (slept 9 hours as I usually do so likely not lack of sleep).

  
Meds/Supplments currently on: the probiotics mentioned above, b12 supplement (just began again), pepcid 60 mg (stopped for a week as i thought it was triggering headaches but they didn't stop, so resumed two days ago) 

Some research shows that aspirin might be better for mast cell stabilization but obv it's still an NSAID. I am sticking with a low-histamine diet for a week but not sure it's really helping. Doctor is stumped and says just give it time, but this severe fatigue combined with the weird head pulsing/headache is really unbearable and hoping to hear from others who have insight into what might be going on.",1,1755968767.0,HPylori,9,1.0,False

Well i opened the portal with my telepathy and the all 3 characters are finally free. The couple thanked me and went somewhere, and Hyena also thanked and added ""I love you!"".

I play just about any kind of game but recently I can't seem to pull myself out of the same three titles and I desperately want to play something new, but nothing is catching my eye really.  
The current rotation has been Division 2, Hades 2, and Subnautica. I recently got Tiny Bookshop and that's helped get me into playing something else and I really enjoy it, but it's been hard to hold my attention.  
I've recently been playing FFXVI as well and I'm enjoying that but I have a very busy life and sitting down for FFXVI takes planning.  
I'm pretty devastated seeing what's happening with Subnautica 2 and while I hope there will be a resolution for the fans we all know what Krafton can do (RIP KSP2). I really can't think of a genre I don't enjoy, so lay it on me. Whats your favorite? What is that game that you keep going back to when the world is on fire and you need a nap? What new game did you try with low expectations and got better payoff than you expected (For me that was Tiny Bookshop, Is This Seat Taken? and Coffee Caravan).

A two and a half hour drive from Banff National Park, Red Deer‚Äôs location dead-center between Edmonton and Calgary quickly made it grow into the third largest city in Alberta, and it‚Äôs *still* growing. Because of its vast walking and biking trails, parks, and kayaking down the Red Deer River that cuts through it, Red Deer is the most ""active city"" in Canada. But its larger and more sensational title ‚Äî ""Highest Crime Rate of Any City in Canada"" ‚Äî would technically and probably make it the most anti-Canadian city in Canada, if that‚Äôs something possible. Mostly property crimes and auto theft, over proportionate to the stereotypical violent crime we also have, but my dad wanted out of there just the same.¬†

I don't remember this happening, but my dad says someone stole his car while I was still strapped in my carseat. The guy drove at high speeds for five minutes before noticing me in the rearview mirror. To the guy's credit, he immediately pulled over, parked, turned the AC on, and ran. When the RCMP caught him eventually, he said stealing a kid wasn‚Äôt shit he signed up for. My dad always warned me that it could have been so much worse, that it could have been someone else not so nice. But that was his final straw.

My father was the first and only city-boy in his large and poor immigrant family to buy land, and on top of that, land in the remote peaceful countryside away from any chaos. The property was sold at a great discounted price, the only reason such a dream could be possible. The neighbor who sold it to us, Lucas Thompson, his mean father used to own our homestead. But after Mr. Thompson's father got drunk and attacked a coyote with his bare hands, it bit him and gave him something apparently similar to rabies, then he died. Mr. Thompson told us to never go near the coyotes or any of the animals within the property limits, but they're everywhere and it's never been an issue.

The homestead my dad bought and rebuilt ‚Äî Coyote Ridge Ranch ‚Äî was a 15 mile (or 24 kilometer) drive outside Red Deer. Once you escaped the confines of city limits, you soared past rolling hills of vibrantly yellow canola fields, broken up by spits of white quaking aspen and spruce forest (the trees too reedy for a proper tree-fort, unfortunately). At the end of your 15 mile cruise, you‚Äôd turn off Range Road 260 onto a single lane gravel road that stretched 3 miles. That was the place I was privileged to call home.

My earliest memory wasn't a car heist. My earliest memory was my father taking me into the woods one night as a four-year-old, gently shushing me, and pointing up. Above, clinging to a high tree limb, was a massive porcupine, the same one that we think later put a dozen quills into the muzzle of one of our dogs, Cocoa. That was just the beginning of my obsession with animals. There was the tiny fawn I found in the tall grass, hiding with its head down and eyes closed until I passed. Or the foxes I would chase on my bike until I lost sight of them in the trees. Or the prairie dogs that always darted across the gravel as we drove up, and ducked down in the fields ‚Äî though I haven‚Äôt seen one in almost fifteen years. My dad swore up and down he hadn‚Äôt drowned out a prairie dog from its tunnel since he was at least a teenager, when he used to trespass with his friends and pine over this area.¬†

Dad never seemed protective of any wild animals, but his enthusiasm for birds was an exception. He was elated when I woke him up to tell him there was a nest of barn swallows outside my window. He was even more excited when a **ruby-throated hummingbird** hit our large living room window ‚Äî he gently put the hummingbird in my hand while we waited for it to fly away again. My dad constantly pointed out yellow-warblers and Bohemian-wax-wings to me from the front porch, his binoculars and thumbed-through bird books always on the coffee table. Even when bird shit started to cake the porch because of the barn swallow‚Äôs nest, he wouldn‚Äôt let anyone touch them or move it. *‚ÄúTook a lot of work for them to build, kid. They‚Äôre so cheerful with their chirps every morning, can't lose 'em.‚Äù* As much as my dad liked birds, I never liked our chickens. There were too many thoughts behind their eyes.

I had very few friends, only the animals. I chased away my older male cousins by becoming hysterical every time they shot a frog or bird with their pellet guns. The few friends I did have as a child, a couple sons of a few neighbors, stopped coming over once my father had his falling-out with their parents. I hear one friend moved to big city Calgary and one moved to big city Edmonton when they grew up. It seems no one thought to stay here in Red Deer.

Despite the crime of the city we‚Äôd moved away from, my father never locked our doors. He always said *‚ÄúIf anyone‚Äôs ever gone so far out of their way to break into our house in the middle of the country, glass doors won‚Äôt stop them. Might as well let them take what they want, then have broken windows and doors and still lose our stuff anyway.‚Äù* When I asked him what would happen if we were home when someone broke in, he said *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what dads and baseball bats under the bed are for.‚Äù* When I asked what would happen if it were ever just *me* home alone and someone tried to break in, he said *‚ÄúSuperman will always be here to protect you.‚Äù*

Ultimately, my childhood is what inspired me to also move away like my lost friends, to chase a doctorate in Zoology from the University of Florida. Before I moved, in my home-schooled isolation from any peers my age, I struggled to feel like a real Canadian; an identity crisis that increased as I became comfortable and acclimated to living in the United States. But I still told myself I felt like a proud Albertan, because the land itself was and would always be my home. The dirt just somehow smelled different. The sage and wildflowers were different. How the trees and grass and bugs rustled every night as the sun set was somehow different. I could tell it was, I listened. I didn‚Äôt know much about Canadian politics or music or history, or even much of the Metric system anymore. But I could tell you everything about how Alberta‚Äôs geology and paleontology was unique. Maybe I‚Äôd even lost the accent, but no one could take from me what was inside me. Maybe my dad didn‚Äôt always feel like he‚Äôd earned his spot as a real Canadian, but I would‚Äôt be him.

Every year that I come home to visit, I see the city expand more and more. The drive into town changed from a thirty minute drive to twenty-five. I feel a deep anxiety that someday the concrete expanse of Red Deer will overtake my peaceful shelter, which wasn‚Äôt helped by my own father‚Äôs push when I was a child to subdivide the acreage. The neighbors, who shared a similar sentiment to mine, fought my father tooth and nail to preserve the sanctity of this cut of countryside and never bring in more strangers. They were real ranchers. My father was an outsider who tried to sneak in. Even with our neighbors a minimum of kilometers away, it was still somehow possible to feel even more alone.

There is some fraud to the picture I‚Äôm painting. Yes, we lived on an isolated homestead, but my father wasn‚Äôt running other men‚Äôs horses or beef cattle on our property for the sake of his livelihood like traditional Albertan ranchers. This lifestyle was a hobby to him, an appearance he enjoyed finally proving to his family he‚Äôd earned. But he‚Äôd drive into the city everyday and work like everyone else there. Maybe I‚Äôm a fraud too. Maybe I‚Äôm not really a rugged Canadian, maybe I‚Äôm really no one. Maybe I went to Florida to prove I‚Äôm an animal person, maybe I moved to the states to be the only Canadian in the room. Because when a second one shows up, suddenly the cracks in my story show.

Sometimes life out here with animals could be unsettling to a young child, though. Like the time I found deep footprints beside our stock pond, moose prints so large in the mud I thought at first glance they were made by grizzly paws. Nothing to a frost-bitten Canadian beats a grizzly bear in fear factor like an angry, horny bull moose.¬†

Or, the time our barn cat, Herbie, her litter of newborn kittens suddenly completely vanished.¬†

Or, the time I woke up in the middle of the night, startled, from the sudden ear piercing shriek of a dozen coyotes all at once right outside my window. The medley of howling was so close and so intense, it sounded like they were only on the other side of the glass. And as soon as the howling abruptly started ‚Äî once I sat upright ‚Äî it immediately and unnaturally stopped. As if it had never been there at all, as if I had only dreamt it in the last few seconds of sleep. I stayed awake and frozen, listening, panting in the stuffiness of my room. Then ‚Äî now focused on the eerie silence, on the uncanny absence of yipping ‚Äî a new noise came. It was faint, a faint crunch of gravel down the slope of our driveway. Something was walking up the drive, slowly and methodically. But it wasn‚Äôt a pack of scurrying animals. It was only one set of footsteps, staggering each lurch with a heavy pause. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Up the gravel towards the house, towards my window.

There was only once in my life I ever intentionally hurt an animal.

But I always thought, no matter the risks of rugged life out here (like the mother moose I surprised while picking wild raspberries and saskatoons in the deep brush, or the young bull that escaped from its pen and charged at me), any of it was safer than life in the city. As much danger large animals can be to people, *people would always be more dangerous than animals.*

I had taken a few weeks off this summer from my masters thesis research ‚Äî studying the egg-laying habits of strawberry poison dart frogs ‚Äî to see my dad. He waited until I was in the Jeep with him at arrivals to tell me that we wouldn‚Äôt really be camping again in a remote corner of the Yukon Territories after all. Dad was ill, very ill. It was an odd form of cancer that had rapidly developed in his throat and tonsils. But thankfully, despite the normal snail-pace of Canadian healthcare, he was being put through surgery extremely quickly. He'd already had so many appointments before I came that the preliminary work was over. Dad wouldn‚Äôt let me tell anyone in the family that he was sick, it just wasn‚Äôt the family‚Äôs culture. Out of embarrassment, Grandpa stopped going to church when he found out the congregation was praying for his colon cancer, and my dad wasn‚Äôt much better. Dad was determined to always be my invincible superman.

I asked him if I could come to the hospital with him in Calgary, to support him. But Dad each time said *‚ÄúNo thank you, Pearl.‚Äù* My dad didn‚Äôt want me to see him in pain, or struggling, or unable to talk or use his tongue in the immediate aftermath of the surgery. He said all he wanted was to be able to come home to me when he‚Äôd regained himself. All he needed to recover was the rare treat of being in my company, to sit on the couch with me, drink Prosecco, and watch our old shows together like *F Troop* and *Hogan‚Äôs Heroes*.

Once we parked in front of the house and I got out, I noticed a sizable dent in the front of his Jeep. But when I inquired about it, he acted like I hadn't asked.¬†

Surgery on his throat was early the next morning, an hour and a half drive. That evening, I watched as he drove away in his old Wrangler Jeep, gravel kicking up behind him in a cloud of dust. I tried not to cry while still in his view, but at least he could see how much I cared.¬†Before my dad got in his Jeep, he put a tender hand on my shoulder and looked deep in my eyes. A soulful, whispy quality in him I hadn't seen in a long time. *""Pearl, you have no idea what it means that you're here again. I can overcome anything I'm hit with, knowing I have you to come home to. You can 'mind over matter' anything.""*

Coming back to Alberta always felt like some sort of arrested development. I am a woman, but all the same, why was the idea of being home alone overnight here so hard? In Florida, I was an accomplished and independent student living in my own dorm. Hell, I‚Äôd already done an internship in Costa Rica, and I‚Äôd be doing a field research trip in Kenya in a few years to study strange African amphibians like caecilians for my doctorate thesis (I‚Äôd almost studied **Albertan tiger salamanders** for my masters thesis, but chose something more exotic and exciting). But coming home, I struggle to even pick out my own food at the grocery store. *What‚Äôs wrong with me?* But maybe that revert to childlikeness was a good thing, like a constant source of comfort I was still tapping into. The day I don‚Äôt turn up that long 3 mile drive off Range Road 260 to get home is the day something deep inside me will die. *But all those strange noises at night by myself, in the middle of nowhere‚Ä¶*¬†

Once Dad was gone, I sat on the porch watching where he'd disappeared to, and drank more than half a bottle of flavored rum, like the white-trash Florida woman I‚Äôd become. Immediately, I realized it was a mistake. Normally, getting a little blitzed loosened me up, made me soft and giggly, and put me to bed. But instead, I was abnormally paranoid. Every creak and rustle around me on the porch felt like a hidden peril. Maybe I should have drank the Prosecco instead.¬†

Like it bothered me how the cows were acting. Their grazing pasture encircled half the property, only 20 feet from the house. In the morning, they‚Äôd walk together in a single file line, all at their own individual pace with their own gestures. In my opinion, watching them was the best way to start the day with a cup of tea. But once my dad drove off, now all the beef cows gathered along the fence, standing side by side and staring at me, silent. No moos. No flicking of their ears, no swatting their heads and necks at bugs. After a few minutes of all watching me, all at once, they turned and walked off, dispersing into the hills of their field and disappearing from sight.

It also bothered me that the cat food bowl I‚Äôd filled earlier was still full. Herbie had long since disappeared, but one of her surviving kittens, Fluffy, had somehow managed to stick around. Dad hadn‚Äôt seen her in days, but he said her food bowl at least was always partially eaten or empty by sundown. I knew death was always a possibility for the cats, now down to only one. I hated that my dad wouldn‚Äôt get them fixed or keep them inside. Momma barn cats having inbred litters over and over again every summer was so hard on their little bodies, coyotes would always get them eventually, and outdoor cats kill billions of birds every year. But my dad cared about paying for people more than he cared about paying for animals, and didn‚Äôt see the need in interfering. *‚ÄúLive and let live,‚Äù* he‚Äôd say. He never trained the dogs to do tricks, or put collars on them, he thought it was disrespectful. They stayed outside, he stayed inside. You can guess where I was.¬†

I checked my phone, I was down to five percent. I got up, warm and wobbly from the rum, and wandered down the steps to Dad‚Äôs beat-up sedan. I‚Äôd taken my charger earlier when I ran to the grocery store before he left with his Jeep. I hadn‚Äôt bothered to put my shoes back on, and I was grateful my barefeet could still tolerate gravel. My entire childhood, I‚Äôd run up and down that steep drive with no shoes. The trick to remember is that pain from jagged gravel is dull and predicable, but the pain of surprise thistle in soft grass isn‚Äôt.¬†

I pulled the heavy handle. *‚ÄúShit.‚Äù*

There were his keys on the dash. My dumbass forgot his car was old, annoyingly and defiantly old, and for some inexplicable reason, it locks automatically if you leave the fob inside.¬†I could have sworn I had the fob securely in my pocket when I climbed out.

*‚ÄúFuck you, Pearl. Fuck my life.‚Äù*¬†

I rubbed my eyes. Stupidly, my disappointment first and foremost was that I couldn‚Äôt listen to a podcast as I fell asleep that night (and anxiety from my dad‚Äôs grumpiness when he'd learned I‚Äôd locked us out of the car again). But then the greater importance of not having a cell phone in case of an emergency hit me. Now, not only was I alone, but I had no way to drive away or call for help if something happened. I grabbed a wire hanger from inside and tried to fiddle with the door, but in my inebriated state it was no use. I went inside, searched my dad‚Äôs bedroom and office, none of his chargers fit my older phone model.¬†While I was shuffling through his things, I found a contract my dad had signed to authorize oil drilling on the property again. He was going to make a lot of money if it went through. *Why hadn't he told me?*

I tried each car door one more time, no luck. I checked my phone, down to four percent. I fumbled with it and switched to airplane mode to preserve battery. I looked up around the property, feeling exposed to no longer be on the porch with the house to my back.¬†*Damn, I miss having dogs.* Once Cocoa and Hershey died, my dad didn‚Äôt want new puppies. Maybe it was for the best, but I would have rather not felt so alone in that moment.¬†Frustrated, I drank more, hoping this unease would dissipate. But the more I dulled my senses, the more I felt like I was in imminent danger.

I didn‚Äôt know how much longer I could stand being outside at all. There was an overwhelming odor of chicken manure. Chicken shit smells so different and so much worse than cow shit, I‚Äôd never managed to get used to that stench. But Dad hadn‚Äôt bought any new chickens in years, the coop was still falling apart. No matter where the wind blew from, or no wind at all, the smell was inescapable. I got up, antsy, and inside I microwaved up a bowl of instant pesto pasta. When I came back outside, thankfully the chicken manure smell was gone, and I could eat in some shamble of peace.

The sun was finally setting. Then, there was a strange buzzing outside, in the distance. It was a long unbroken note at first, then overtime it broke up, un-rhythmically, like someone or something *panting*. But the deep, droning, buzzing quality didn‚Äôt change. Then the panting in the distance turned into a yakking, past the hills, like something was violently throwing up.

I got up, my heart skidding. More than that, I was annoyed it was skidding. Why couldn‚Äôt I just enjoy this beautiful place? I went inside again and slammed the door, too stubborn to entertain this panic. I wanted to keep the house ventilated with the two screen doors, but the noise was so much, I closed all the doors and windows. I checked my phone, three percent. *Why would you think this is an emergency? Is it 911 in Canada too, or is it 999 like the British? Of course it's 911.* I couldn‚Äôt think straight at this point, the house was getting so warm. As it got darker outside, I couldn‚Äôt tell if what I was seeing were eyes outside, or lights from the house distorted in the glass reflections. I felt bloated, like I was being pumped with hot air. It was so sudden, it felt like I was becoming a sausage. *Why did I drink this much?*

I then felt a sudden unearthly tiredness that overcame me. I was too sleepy and stumbling to even make it to my old bedroom. I laid out on the couch and crashed, hard. I don't remember what I dreamt about, but it smelled of decay. And our two dogs were there, Cocoa and Hershey. They were black labs mixed with blue heeler, adopted the day we moved onto this property. I‚Äôd known them my whole life until I was twelve. I dreamt of them often. But I never dreamt of Honey.

Honey was a cousin or something to Cocoa and Hershey, I don't know how, but she was bred by the same neighbor, Jake Duke on the north side of the property. A late addition to our little family. Honey was an inbred golden lab mix, her parents were siblings. Honey never acted quite right. Cocoa and Hershey, untrained but perfect as they were, always trailed behind us in a single-file line when we went on family walks, the cats and trusting chickens following close behind the two dogs in turn. But Honey would stop and squat to take a shit right in front of you on the path, oblivious you‚Äôd walk straight into it. Hershey once brought home a dying baby bunny in her mouth that she found, gentle and maternal, giving it to me to take care of (it died anyway). Cocoa once nearly gave his life protecting the free roaming chickens from a red fox. But Honey wasn‚Äôt like that. Something wasn‚Äôt right with Honey.¬†

Things came to a breaking point when Honey attacked one of the ducks in the pond. She shook it to pieces in her mouth, blood and organs and feathers everywhere. While Honey was mauling this duck, Cocoa and Hershey were rounding up the other ducks and ducklings like the precious discount sheepdogs they were. My dad wouldn‚Äôt tolerate this, he couldn‚Äôt trust Honey anymore. What if Honey attacked me, too? Would my tiny hands and fingers be able to push her off? And my dad wouldn‚Äôt give her up to the pound so another unsuspecting family would have to deal with her. So, my dad took her up the hill in the forest, shotgun in hand, and once out of sight, but not out of earshot from me, he put a bullet between her eyes. Dad said a dog knows when you‚Äôre going to shoot it. Apparently she fought the rope every step up the hill.

When I woke up on the couch, it was so hot, I brushed off my gut feeling that I'd been watched through the large living room windows while I slept. I panicked and thought the furnace had automatically kicked on or something, but it hadn't. I got up and looked for a box fan, I'd be pissed if my dad had thrown it out. I was shocked I was still as drunk as I was before. When I passed his computer again to go for his office closet, I realized I might still be able to reach people after all. I could text the neighbors from his desktop. His password was still my name.

When I logged into his computer, I was startled. Deeply startled. My dad had been on reddit (not the scary part). On a new account, he'd posted a gory photo of his Jeep's fender dent, covered in blood, with a decapitated coyote on the side of the road. He'd uploaded it *weeks* ago, but he still had it open, as if he'd just posted it. There were a lot of comments. None answering his question. Maybe he was still checking for an answer.

*""I was angry something fell through last night. I had a few, saw this on the road, and swerved to hit it. Yeah, I'm an asshole. Not my finest moment. Any advice how I can get this dent out? It's not coming out no matter what I do.""*

The coyote had been hit in the throat, its neck torn open, head hanging back limply.

*Is he in his right mind?* *Why would he post this? This is unspeakable.* *He could have driven away and washed the blood off first. Why show the coyote? Why did he have to take a picture in that moment?*

I closed the internet browser and went to his messages. The most recent text was a reminder from my dad's doctor for his scheduled appointment tomorrow morning, he'd replied ""CONFIRM,"" as he had to every other appointment reminder before. I typed the name of our closest neighbor, Lucas Thompson, in the text search bar. Then I paused again.

My dad's last message to Lucas Thompson: *""Please buy it back. I'll take anything. I need to get off this property. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Tell me more about what happened to your dad.""*

Lucas Thompson: *""It‚Äôs too late. We all tried to warn you.""*

My dad: *""I'm not doing the oil drilling anymore. It wouldn't let us. Please call me.""*

I checked the paperwork on my dad's desk again. I hadn't read the contract properly the first time, I was too distracted. The contract authorizing oil drilling had actually been *canceled*. I thumbed through the contract, constantly losing my place from how my fingers shook. The ""Act of God"" clause of the contract was circled in yellow highlighter. Handwriting (that wasn't my father's) scribbled ""Reference incident report and 'Act of God' contractual reason for cancellation."" *What incident?* I couldn't find the incident report for the longest time. *Something about great bodily harm to the surveyor, but all these words are blurring together.*

I started to drunkenly text Lucas Thompson through the computer. It was as slurred as I was, full of typos. I had to start over a few times.

*""Lukas, this is earl. Perl. im here al one. can u chack onme""*

I hit send, then got up. At this point, I was too warm to function or process this more. A thick mucusy sweat was dripping down and rubbing between my fingers.

I was too hazy to notice that Mr. Lucas immediately texted back: *""You didn't deserve this.""*

I got up and searched through my dad's closet top and bottom, sloppily knocking everything over onto myself. Nothing. No fan. I was so hot I thought I'd die. But something told me to not open any windows. The humming and yakking outside wasn‚Äôt going away. It's not just that, I noticed something else ‚Äî the chirp of the insects and symphony of frogs outside, muted through the walls, would stop and start again. Start and stop. Start and stop. As if I was plugging my ears and taking my fingers out over and over. It was everywhere. And it was just getting *louder*.

I went to the bathroom and flushed my face with cold tap water. It smelled foul, the well water always smells foul. Something to root me to reality.¬†I gripped the sides of the sink. Outside, in the forest, the rumble and crack of a tree falling befuddled me, like a factory reset to my mind. In my entire life on Coyote Ridge Ranch, I had never heard a tree fall.

Then a second tree fell.

*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs coming?‚Äù*

I checked my phone. Two percent. *What would I even tell the cops?* Then I looked up from the sink to the dirty smudged mirror. I dropped my phone, and it cracked on the tile floor. I rubbed my eyes. My mouth had grown wider, impossibly so, my lips thinning and stretched. My eyes much smaller, and drifting apart like continents. I wiped the mirror clean, but the reality was only worse. When I‚Äôd look at my eyes, it looked like my mouth was growing. When I stared at my mouth, it was my eyes that were still changing. Like trying to track a floater in the corner of your vision, you swear you‚Äôre noticing something, but as soon as you focus on it, it darts away. My nose was sinking into my skin. I swear I wouldn‚Äôt miss that.¬†

I left the bathroom, stumbling as I scooped my phone back up. Still two percent. The house was impossibly stuffy, like the air was encasing me in a dry pressurized tomb. I desperately just wanted to open a screened door, I just wanted a breath of fresh air to think clearly. But my hearing was still overwhelmed. The unrhythmic droning (and coughing) was so loud, the staggered insects and frogs were so enveloping, my senses were entirely overstimulated. I went upstairs to the bonus room, sloppily, falling on my face a few times as I climbed. I ran to the back of the room, moonlight streaming through the small single window, and I propped it open with a book. As soon as the window slid up and hit the top, the barrage of noises outside stopped.

I didn't care. I breathed in the fresh air with my wide open mouth against the window screen, grateful to feel the wind on my tongue. I paused, and held my breath. Outside below me was the whining of a frail newborn kitten. A single one. It was soft, hungry, barely a sigh.

Despite my heat exhaustion, I felt my sweat run cold.

*Don‚Äôt go outside.*

*It‚Äôs trying to make you go outside.*¬†

My movements weren‚Äôt frantic and sporadic anymore. Calculated and cautioned, but still wobbly, I pulled a flashlight from a drawer, and slowly lifted it to the screen of the window. Nothing.

My chest hurt. Everything hurt. The acidic ballooning in my stomach and igneous constricting of my esophagus was only worse. This must have been the worst panic attack I‚Äôd ever experienced in my life because the physical toll was unbearable.¬†Some how, impossibly, I wasn‚Äôt sobering up. I was getting drunker.

My fingers fumbling with the screen, I slide my phone off airplane mode, ready to finally call someone, anyone. I couldn't justify toughing through this anymore. I couldn't be stoic like my dad.

The phone died in my hands. I held down all the buttons to power it back on, hoping for any semblance of a second chance. Probably in vain, but maybe it had just crashed, it was an old model, it crashed all the time. It was still at two percent.

Overwhelmed, I gripped my knees, and started vomiting. My vision was blacking in and out, I couldn‚Äôt see where I‚Äôd blown chunks, but some of it hit my bare legs. As I stood back up, swaying, I was perplexed. I felt so hot and corrosive inside. But whatever was coating my legs was ice cold. My vision still spotting, I swiped my hand on my leg and smelled it. It didn‚Äôt smell like bile and stomach acid and pesto. It smelled like dead fish.

*‚ÄúAlright, time to kill yourself Pearl.‚Äù*

I gripped the windowsill, trying to swallow a deep and helpless cry. Then paused. I was snapped out of my internal misery. My dad was outside, standing in the high grass of the field, shrouded by the halo of moonlight at his back. I couldn't tell if he was staring straight ahead into the void or directly up at me.

I lifted the flashlight to the window screen a second time, then immediately dropped it, no, *threw* it away. The moment my flashlight crossed his body, that's when I chucked it. *That is my father outside. But something is very, very wrong.* His mouth came down to his stomach, I don't know how to describe it, I didn't look at it long enough, I *wouldn't* look at it long enough. Ruby red blood ran down from under his chin, soaking his entire neck, like any skin past his ears had been flayed.

His eyes.

Something was wrong with his eyes. They weren't bloodshot, but they were flat, bulbous, and orange.

That's all I saw before I slammed the window shut. I sank to the floor, my back to the wall. I had to stay quiet. My tongue felt so large in my mouth, I couldn't gasp even if I wanted to.

*DING!* I jumped out of my skin.

Miraculously, my phone turned back on. One percent. I had a new text from several hours ago, one of the neighbors who doesn't speak to us.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""I saw your dad crashed his Jeep at the property line. I'm sorry.""*

I frantically typed: *""Hwat? hes hear! Helpm!""*

No response. I sent more.

*""Somethng,s happeggg! wh Y? Whats happenigg?""*

He texted back immediately.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""It was probably Honey.""*

It died, for good.

*I need water. I need water on my skin, or I‚Äôll die.*

But when I ran back downstairs to the bathroom, the minerals in the well water burned my skin. I didn't care. I needed it so bad. Then, the water stopped running from the facet.

I had no choice.

I burst through the front door and ran into the night, toward the stock ponds. I tripped on the porch and fell on my face, it loosened my teeth but I didn't care, I kept going. I didn't care about the noises coming from behind me in the tall grass, or the yacking hum and drone that had come back, nothing mattered to me more than this thirst in my skin. But when the water came into view, I didn't take another step.

The large pond was still full of water, but the small stock pond had dried up. In the center of the empty pond, the normal corpses of my dad ‚Äî and *me* ‚Äî were lying, bloated, being consumed by hordes of red ants.

*""That's not me, I'm still here.""*

There was a third body sunk deeper in the fresh mud, much farther in decomposition than ours. Though it looked barely human ‚Äî at first, I thought I was looking at the corpse of a **maned wolf**. His arms and legs were char black, they'd been mutilated and extended. His bones jutted back and fanned from his spine, and orange fungus erupted from his skin. He had the same cleft palate that runs in Lucas Thompson's family.

I was slammed to my back, and dragged. The peaceful quilt of unpolluted stars passed above me in a blur. I screamed and twisted my body, frantic to break free from whatever had once been my dad. But the grip on my ankle and the swiftness I was dragged through the high grass was inescapable. I felt a fiery, chemical burning, like every plant irritant I touched absorbed into my skin and pumped through my system.

My shirt was catching on the thistles and brambles dragged under me, the naked skin of my back scraping like hell. I grabbed at the grass, desperate to stop wherever we were going, desperate to fight whatever was coming.

When I was forcefully pulled through an Alberta-rose bush, there was a new, horrific sensation. My arms and legs caught on the thorns, and I could feel large portions of my skin slopping off my body. I screamed even louder. The lower dermis on my arms and legs were exposed, like I was a peach being blanched. When that fell away, my muscles underneath were left open, dragging bare in the dust and rocks. The long, unbroken shriek that left my lungs felt inhuman ‚Äî but still inaudible over the humming that might split my head open, coming from whatever became of my dad. But even in the darkness under the moon, the color wasn‚Äôt right. My muscles weren't pulpy pink and red, my flesh under my skin was black and puss yellow.¬†I vomited again as my head thrashed back and forth. I spewed wads of viscus leaches all over my chest. They attached themselves to my exposed flesh, and swiftly burrowed winding trenches through open muscle as they ate me alive.

*I said I've only ever hurt an animal on purpose, one time...*

Once, I *did* push one of the cats off the roof. I heard they‚Äôd always land on their feet, so I wanted to see it. The cat was fine, as far as I know, I wasn't *trying* to hurt Herbie. Once, I did accidentally tear the wings off a dragonfly when I tried catching it in my hands ‚Äî though it seems it got even, because an hour later I was attacked by a swarm of wasps and sent to the hospital in anaphylactic shock. Once, one of the baby birds outside my window stopped eating, so I took it from its nest and forced food into its mouth with a tube. But I fed it too much, its little lungs aspirated, it chocked in my hands and died. The next day all the baby birds were gone. They weren‚Äôt old enough to fly away.

Once or twice, I did dissect a dead frog and a dead tiger salamander I found floating in the pond. I was so fascinated by their anatomy, I fell in love with amphibians.¬†

*But once... Only one time... I can remember when I was eleven, I became fixated on how cool I thought ducks were* ‚Äî *the webbing in their feet and the delicate feathers in their wings. I wanted so badly to dissect one* *and see the tendons in their wings. One of the ducklings was sick. I checked on it everyday, but it wouldn‚Äôt die fast enough‚Ä¶*

The rotting skin of my dad's arms and back were scabbing and crumbling into a flaky and vivid gangrene. My dad's long hanging mouth and open bleeding throat fused into a single fleshy and narrow mandible, his teeth detached and flowing down from his jaw and jutting out both sides like a serrated beak. His arms, they weren't just growing, both arms were *fraying* apart ‚Äî like stick cheese being pulled five ways at the base and curled down. Each finger split apart from his hand, each peeling back individual tendons, separating muscle. It bisected and splintered his bones, he cried out as the sponge and viscera of his bone marrow leaked out in a pulpy grey and purple mass. What his arms were now fanned and folded, like wings.

*Well, I was so afraid to get in trouble with my dad, that once I was finished, I put the dissected duck in Honey‚Äôs mouth.*

*That night, the coyotes came and woke me, and the quiet footsteps approached.*

*The next year, Cocoa and Hershey were both hit by two different drunk drivers.*

I was dragged into the murky pond water. My dad seized me by my throat with what remained of his hands, and shook me up and down under the water, callously drowning me. Water and slimy algae flooded my throat and my lungs. I clawed at his face, unrecognizable from the man who I loved most, the man who always swore to protect me. Hornwort weed entangled around my wet slippery fingers as I tried to push him off. But my fingers weren‚Äôt mine anymore. None of this was mine.

While I thrashed and fought blindly and terrifyingly for my life, my mind began to slow down and disassociate. His humming drone was finally muted with my ears underwater. My internal voice felt cold and echoey ‚Äî like thought was unnecessary to the outcome of my circumstances. Or maybe that thought wasn‚Äôt a part of me anymore.

*How do these perfectly working little ecosystems spring up?* I thought in academic detachment. *My dad filled these ponds himself with a pump and a hose, but they‚Äôve got leeches, tiger salamanders, water bugs, and cat tails all on their own. As if they were always here.*

With his mouth, my father sliced my abdomen open. Where my ovaries should have been, fish eggs spilled out. But they weren‚Äôt fish eggs, there were tiny salamanders wriggling and squirming inside.¬†

The voice in my mind went quieter and quieter, drifting far away from my reach. Until I could barely hear it at all:

*The crime in Red Deer wasn‚Äôt all that bad.*¬†",4,1755968247.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I was drinking coffee near my university, and some villian looking dude said that i forgot to open the portal, cus Invisible  Woman, Mr fantastic and anthro hyena are stuck inside the portal (Sue storm traped  themselves because she used force field to close potal).   
  
Well i opened the portal with my telepathy and the all 3 characters are finally free. The couple thanked me and went somewhere, and Hyena also thanked and added ""I love you!"". For some reason, i had thought ""It\`s a trap! He wants me to say it so he\`ll crack a joke ""HA, got you! You\`re GAYYY!"" "". So i said ""Love you too,but without homo part"" and i just ran as fast as i could. Hyena went to chase me, Eventually he got me and stopped me to say that i forgot my bag, and he gave it.

But I HAVE cried watching videos of people with  ADHD telling their symptoms and I have felt puzzle pieces click in place after learning about autism. Then I was confused for a long time. Which one is it? Or do I even have any of them. And neither of them answers everything. And I have always had two opposite sides in everything.

And then I found a video where someone said you may have both if you relate to people with both rather than people with only either or. And I found this page and read a few posts here and then I cried again.

So the thing is, I have always related to computer, robot or AI. I love how direct they are with commands and tasks. Where people leave out stuff and assume the other person to fill in the blank with common sense, which I know I lack. But also I take suggestions or sarcasm or joke seriously.

My sister and I was going to a store. My sister told me to buy her something while she looks for something else. My sister says, 
""You go up there and say..... Uncle, give me that [product]... Ok?"" 
(We call relatives, close people or people we know uncle and aunty, so calling a shopkeepers where we are regular, as uncle is not a big deal. But the thing is I don't know that shopkeeper)
I nod my head and say Ok. Like registering it as a task, like the ""memory updated"" that chatgpt says. Like ok. So I should call him uncle.
My sister laughs and says, ""No I was joking. Don't call him that. You don't even know him. Were you really going to do that?"" 
And I was like, ""Yeahh! You told me to! üò≠"" üòÇ 


I went out a few hours ago with my sister for some work related thing, mom asked me if I am not going to eat anything pointing to a bown of rice already plated. I said I will eat after coming back. I had a snack while I was out. I came back, preparing dinner with sister. I quickly fill up my plate and sit down to eat. My sister asks ""Are you going to eat now? You are hungry so early?"" (I usually don't eat so early, there are still a few hours until dinner) I said yeah.
And then I pause. No I am not hungry. I had a few snacks and sweet and a cup of coffee just half an hour - 1 hour ago. I am still kinda full. But I just automatically fill up my food and sit down to eat because I told mom I will eat right after coming back. Is this normal?


Also, I hate cooking... it's so tedious and time consuming. I HATE it. Even I am starving, I would rather staff myself with biscuits and other packed stuff, or 2 min noodles, than even boil potatoes, or fry an egg. But since mom got sick, me and my sister have been cooking. Turns out if I know all the process steps and I am given to cook like a task, I am fine doing it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 


One time I was coming from class, my friend told me to hold her bag so she can enter the bathroom stall. There was a chair nearby. I looked at the chair and looked at her and picked the bag. I thought because there was already this chair and she has seen it but decided to tell me to hold the bag, she didn't want me to put the bag in the chair. I was holding the bag. It was a little heavy, but ok. She comes out and says, you could have put it in the chair. And I was like ""Oh.""


In middle school, 2 of my friends were dating. I was aware of it. Both of their initials were N and A which combination is obviously NA. Another of my friend was teasing A by telling me ""Do you know A's favourite element is Sodium"". I was confused for a sec is she teasing A or A's  
actually favourite element is Sodium (NA). Guess which dialogue box I chose? ""That's a weird choice, but ok. Everyone has preference, I guess."" She laughed. And that's when I knew I chose the wrong option lol.


Then there was one time, I went to a friend's house for party. She got a plate of food for some people, I was tagging along her. Her hands were full. She said to me ""Get me a plate for her no."" I look back thinking, does she want plate of food or empty plate? I mean sometimes I do get an empty plate to share something. I took a plate and went to her. She looked at it and said, nevermind I will get it. She needed a plate of food for someone.

A two and a half hour drive from Banff National Park, Red Deer‚Äôs location dead-center between Edmonton and Calgary quickly made it grow into the third largest city in Alberta, and it‚Äôs *still* growing. Because of its vast walking and biking trails, parks, and kayaking down the Red Deer River that cuts through it, Red Deer is the most ""active city"" in Canada. But its larger and more sensational title ‚Äî ""Highest Crime Rate of Any City in Canada"" ‚Äî would technically and probably make it the most anti-Canadian city in Canada, if that‚Äôs something possible. Mostly property crimes and auto theft, over proportionate to the stereotypical violent crime we also have, but my dad wanted out of there just the same.¬†

I don't remember this happening, but my dad says someone stole his car while I was still strapped in my carseat. The guy drove at high speeds for five minutes before noticing me in the rearview mirror. To the guy's credit, he immediately pulled over, parked, turned the AC on, and ran. When the RCMP caught him eventually, he said stealing a kid wasn‚Äôt shit he signed up for. My dad always warned me that it could have been so much worse, that it could have been someone else not so nice. But that was his final straw.

My father was the first and only city-boy in his large and poor immigrant family to buy land, and on top of that, land in the remote peaceful countryside away from any chaos. The property was sold at a great discounted price, the only reason such a dream could be possible. The neighbor who sold it to us, Lucas Thompson, his mean father used to own our homestead. But after Mr. Thompson's father got drunk and attacked a coyote with his bare hands, it bit him and gave him something apparently similar to rabies, then he died. Mr. Thompson told us to never go near the coyotes or any of the animals within the property limits, but they're everywhere and it's never been an issue.

The homestead my dad bought and rebuilt ‚Äî Coyote Ridge Ranch ‚Äî was a 15 mile (or 24 kilometer) drive outside Red Deer. Once you escaped the confines of city limits, you soared past rolling hills of vibrantly yellow canola fields, broken up by spits of white quaking aspen and spruce forest (the trees too reedy for a proper tree-fort, unfortunately). At the end of your 15 mile cruise, you‚Äôd turn off Range Road 260 onto a single lane gravel road that stretched 3 miles. That was the place I was privileged to call home.

My earliest memory wasn't a car heist. My earliest memory was my father taking me into the woods one night as a four-year-old, gently shushing me, and pointing up. Above, clinging to a high tree limb, was a massive porcupine, the same one that we think later put a dozen quills into the muzzle of one of our dogs, Cocoa. That was just the beginning of my obsession with animals. There was the tiny fawn I found in the tall grass, hiding with its head down and eyes closed until I passed. Or the foxes I would chase on my bike until I lost sight of them in the trees. Or the prairie dogs that always darted across the gravel as we drove up, and ducked down in the fields ‚Äî though I haven‚Äôt seen one in almost fifteen years. My dad swore up and down he hadn‚Äôt drowned out a prairie dog from its tunnel since he was at least a teenager, when he used to trespass with his friends and pine over this area.¬†

Dad never seemed protective of any wild animals, but his enthusiasm for birds was an exception. He was elated when I woke him up to tell him there was a nest of barn swallows outside my window. He was even more excited when a **ruby-throated hummingbird** hit our large living room window ‚Äî he gently put the hummingbird in my hand while we waited for it to fly away again. My dad constantly pointed out yellow-warblers and Bohemian-wax-wings to me from the front porch, his binoculars and thumbed-through bird books always on the coffee table. Even when bird shit started to cake the porch because of the barn swallow‚Äôs nest, he wouldn‚Äôt let anyone touch them or move it. *‚ÄúTook a lot of work for them to build, kid. They‚Äôre so cheerful with their chirps every morning, can't lose 'em.‚Äù* As much as my dad liked birds, I never liked our chickens. There were too many thoughts behind their eyes.

I had very few friends, only the animals. I chased away my older male cousins by becoming hysterical every time they shot a frog or bird with their pellet guns. The few friends I did have as a child, a couple sons of a few neighbors, stopped coming over once my father had his falling-out with their parents. I hear one friend moved to big city Calgary and one moved to big city Edmonton when they grew up. It seems no one thought to stay here in Red Deer.

Despite the crime of the city we‚Äôd moved away from, my father never locked our doors. He always said *‚ÄúIf anyone‚Äôs ever gone so far out of their way to break into our house in the middle of the country, glass doors won‚Äôt stop them. Might as well let them take what they want, then have broken windows and doors and still lose our stuff anyway.‚Äù* When I asked him what would happen if we were home when someone broke in, he said *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what dads and baseball bats under the bed are for.‚Äù* When I asked what would happen if it were ever just *me* home alone and someone tried to break in, he said *‚ÄúSuperman will always be here to protect you.‚Äù*

Ultimately, my childhood is what inspired me to also move away like my lost friends, to chase a doctorate in Zoology from the University of Florida. Before I moved, in my home-schooled isolation from any peers my age, I struggled to feel like a real Canadian; an identity crisis that increased as I became comfortable and acclimated to living in the United States. But I still told myself I felt like a proud Albertan, because the land itself was and would always be my home. The dirt just somehow smelled different. The sage and wildflowers were different. How the trees and grass and bugs rustled every night as the sun set was somehow different. I could tell it was, I listened. I didn‚Äôt know much about Canadian politics or music or history, or even much of the Metric system anymore. But I could tell you everything about how Alberta‚Äôs geology and paleontology was unique. Maybe I‚Äôd even lost the accent, but no one could take from me what was inside me. Maybe my dad didn‚Äôt always feel like he‚Äôd earned his spot as a real Canadian, but I would‚Äôt be him.

Every year that I come home to visit, I see the city expand more and more. The drive into town changed from a thirty minute drive to twenty-five. I feel a deep anxiety that someday the concrete expanse of Red Deer will overtake my peaceful shelter, which wasn‚Äôt helped by my own father‚Äôs push when I was a child to subdivide the acreage. The neighbors, who shared a similar sentiment to mine, fought my father tooth and nail to preserve the sanctity of this cut of countryside and never bring in more strangers. They were real ranchers. My father was an outsider who tried to sneak in. Even with our neighbors a minimum of kilometers away, it was still somehow possible to feel even more alone.

There is some fraud to the picture I‚Äôm painting. Yes, we lived on an isolated homestead, but my father wasn‚Äôt running other men‚Äôs horses or beef cattle on our property for the sake of his livelihood like traditional Albertan ranchers. This lifestyle was a hobby to him, an appearance he enjoyed finally proving to his family he‚Äôd earned. But he‚Äôd drive into the city everyday and work like everyone else there. Maybe I‚Äôm a fraud too. Maybe I‚Äôm not really a rugged Canadian, maybe I‚Äôm really no one. Maybe I went to Florida to prove I‚Äôm an animal person, maybe I moved to the states to be the only Canadian in the room. Because when a second one shows up, suddenly the cracks in my story show.

Sometimes life out here with animals could be unsettling to a young child, though. Like the time I found deep footprints beside our stock pond, moose prints so large in the mud I thought at first glance they were made by grizzly paws. Nothing to a frost-bitten Canadian beats a grizzly bear in fear factor like an angry, horny bull moose.¬†

Or, the time our barn cat, Herbie, her litter of newborn kittens suddenly completely vanished.¬†

Or, the time I woke up in the middle of the night, startled, from the sudden ear piercing shriek of a dozen coyotes all at once right outside my window. The medley of howling was so close and so intense, it sounded like they were only on the other side of the glass. And as soon as the howling abruptly started ‚Äî once I sat upright ‚Äî it immediately and unnaturally stopped. As if it had never been there at all, as if I had only dreamt it in the last few seconds of sleep. I stayed awake and frozen, listening, panting in the stuffiness of my room. Then ‚Äî now focused on the eerie silence, on the uncanny absence of yipping ‚Äî a new noise came. It was faint, a faint crunch of gravel down the slope of our driveway. Something was walking up the drive, slowly and methodically. But it wasn‚Äôt a pack of scurrying animals. It was only one set of footsteps, staggering each lurch with a heavy pause. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Silence. *Crunch.* Up the gravel towards the house, towards my window.

There was only once in my life I ever intentionally hurt an animal.

But I always thought, no matter the risks of rugged life out here (like the mother moose I surprised while picking wild raspberries and saskatoons in the deep brush, or the young bull that escaped from its pen and charged at me), any of it was safer than life in the city. As much danger large animals can be to people, *people would always be more dangerous than animals.*

I had taken a few weeks off this summer from my masters thesis research ‚Äî studying the egg-laying habits of strawberry poison dart frogs ‚Äî to see my dad. He waited until I was in the Jeep with him at arrivals to tell me that we wouldn‚Äôt really be camping again in a remote corner of the Yukon Territories after all. Dad was ill, very ill. It was an odd form of cancer that had rapidly developed in his throat and tonsils. But thankfully, despite the normal snail-pace of Canadian healthcare, he was being put through surgery extremely quickly. He'd already had so many appointments before I came that the preliminary work was over. Dad wouldn‚Äôt let me tell anyone in the family that he was sick, it just wasn‚Äôt the family‚Äôs culture. Out of embarrassment, Grandpa stopped going to church when he found out the congregation was praying for his colon cancer, and my dad wasn‚Äôt much better. Dad was determined to always be my invincible superman.

I asked him if I could come to the hospital with him in Calgary, to support him. But Dad each time said *‚ÄúNo thank you, Pearl.‚Äù* My dad didn‚Äôt want me to see him in pain, or struggling, or unable to talk or use his tongue in the immediate aftermath of the surgery. He said all he wanted was to be able to come home to me when he‚Äôd regained himself. All he needed to recover was the rare treat of being in my company, to sit on the couch with me, drink Prosecco, and watch our old shows together like *F Troop* and *Hogan‚Äôs Heroes*.

Once we parked in front of the house and I got out, I noticed a sizable dent in the front of his Jeep. But when I inquired about it, he acted like I hadn't asked.¬†

Surgery on his throat was early the next morning, an hour and a half drive. That evening, I watched as he drove away in his old Wrangler Jeep, gravel kicking up behind him in a cloud of dust. I tried not to cry while still in his view, but at least he could see how much I cared.¬†Before my dad got in his Jeep, he put a tender hand on my shoulder and looked deep in my eyes. A soulful, whispy quality in him I hadn't seen in a long time. *""Pearl, you have no idea what it means that you're here again. I can overcome anything I'm hit with, knowing I have you to come home to. You can 'mind over matter' anything.""*

Coming back to Alberta always felt like some sort of arrested development. I am a woman, but all the same, why was the idea of being home alone overnight here so hard? In Florida, I was an accomplished and independent student living in my own dorm. Hell, I‚Äôd already done an internship in Costa Rica, and I‚Äôd be doing a field research trip in Kenya in a few years to study strange African amphibians like caecilians for my doctorate thesis (I‚Äôd almost studied **Albertan tiger salamanders** for my masters thesis, but chose something more exotic and exciting). But coming home, I struggle to even pick out my own food at the grocery store. *What‚Äôs wrong with me?* But maybe that revert to childlikeness was a good thing, like a constant source of comfort I was still tapping into. The day I don‚Äôt turn up that long 3 mile drive off Range Road 260 to get home is the day something deep inside me will die. *But all those strange noises at night by myself, in the middle of nowhere‚Ä¶*¬†

Once Dad was gone, I sat on the porch watching where he'd disappeared to, and drank more than half a bottle of flavored rum, like the white-trash Florida woman I‚Äôd become. Immediately, I realized it was a mistake. Normally, getting a little blitzed loosened me up, made me soft and giggly, and put me to bed. But instead, I was abnormally paranoid. Every creak and rustle around me on the porch felt like a hidden peril. Maybe I should have drank the Prosecco instead.¬†

Like it bothered me how the cows were acting. Their grazing pasture encircled half the property, only 20 feet from the house. In the morning, they‚Äôd walk together in a single file line, all at their own individual pace with their own gestures. In my opinion, watching them was the best way to start the day with a cup of tea. But once my dad drove off, now all the beef cows gathered along the fence, standing side by side and staring at me, silent. No moos. No flicking of their ears, no swatting their heads and necks at bugs. After a few minutes of all watching me, all at once, they turned and walked off, dispersing into the hills of their field and disappearing from sight.

It also bothered me that the cat food bowl I‚Äôd filled earlier was still full. Herbie had long since disappeared, but one of her surviving kittens, Fluffy, had somehow managed to stick around. Dad hadn‚Äôt seen her in days, but he said her food bowl at least was always partially eaten or empty by sundown. I knew death was always a possibility for the cats, now down to only one. I hated that my dad wouldn‚Äôt get them fixed or keep them inside. Momma barn cats having inbred litters over and over again every summer was so hard on their little bodies, coyotes would always get them eventually, and outdoor cats kill billions of birds every year. But my dad cared about paying for people more than he cared about paying for animals, and didn‚Äôt see the need in interfering. *‚ÄúLive and let live,‚Äù* he‚Äôd say. He never trained the dogs to do tricks, or put collars on them, he thought it was disrespectful. They stayed outside, he stayed inside. You can guess where I was.¬†

I checked my phone, I was down to five percent. I got up, warm and wobbly from the rum, and wandered down the steps to Dad‚Äôs beat-up sedan. I‚Äôd taken my charger earlier when I ran to the grocery store before he left with his Jeep. I hadn‚Äôt bothered to put my shoes back on, and I was grateful my barefeet could still tolerate gravel. My entire childhood, I‚Äôd run up and down that steep drive with no shoes. The trick to remember is that pain from jagged gravel is dull and predicable, but the pain of surprise thistle in soft grass isn‚Äôt.¬†

I pulled the heavy handle. *‚ÄúShit.‚Äù*

There were his keys on the dash. My dumbass forgot his car was old, annoyingly and defiantly old, and for some inexplicable reason, it locks automatically if you leave the fob inside.¬†I could have sworn I had the fob securely in my pocket when I climbed out.

*‚ÄúFuck you, Pearl. Fuck my life.‚Äù*¬†

I rubbed my eyes. Stupidly, my disappointment first and foremost was that I couldn‚Äôt listen to a podcast as I fell asleep that night (and anxiety from my dad‚Äôs grumpiness when he'd learned I‚Äôd locked us out of the car again). But then the greater importance of not having a cell phone in case of an emergency hit me. Now, not only was I alone, but I had no way to drive away or call for help if something happened. I grabbed a wire hanger from inside and tried to fiddle with the door, but in my inebriated state it was no use. I went inside, searched my dad‚Äôs bedroom and office, none of his chargers fit my older phone model.¬†While I was shuffling through his things, I found a contract my dad had signed to authorize oil drilling on the property again. He was going to make a lot of money if it went through. *Why hadn't he told me?*

I tried each car door one more time, no luck. I checked my phone, down to four percent. I fumbled with it and switched to airplane mode to preserve battery. I looked up around the property, feeling exposed to no longer be on the porch with the house to my back.¬†*Damn, I miss having dogs.* Once Cocoa and Hershey died, my dad didn‚Äôt want new puppies. Maybe it was for the best, but I would have rather not felt so alone in that moment.¬†Frustrated, I drank more, hoping this unease would dissipate. But the more I dulled my senses, the more I felt like I was in imminent danger.

I didn‚Äôt know how much longer I could stand being outside at all. There was an overwhelming odor of chicken manure. Chicken shit smells so different and so much worse than cow shit, I‚Äôd never managed to get used to that stench. But Dad hadn‚Äôt bought any new chickens in years, the coop was still falling apart. No matter where the wind blew from, or no wind at all, the smell was inescapable. I got up, antsy, and inside I microwaved up a bowl of instant pesto pasta. When I came back outside, thankfully the chicken manure smell was gone, and I could eat in some shamble of peace.

The sun was finally setting. Then, there was a strange buzzing outside, in the distance. It was a long unbroken note at first, then overtime it broke up, un-rhythmically, like someone or something *panting*. But the deep, droning, buzzing quality didn‚Äôt change. Then the panting in the distance turned into a yakking, past the hills, like something was violently throwing up.

I got up, my heart skidding. More than that, I was annoyed it was skidding. Why couldn‚Äôt I just enjoy this beautiful place? I went inside again and slammed the door, too stubborn to entertain this panic. I wanted to keep the house ventilated with the two screen doors, but the noise was so much, I closed all the doors and windows. I checked my phone, three percent. *Why would you think this is an emergency? Is it 911 in Canada too, or is it 999 like the British? Of course it's 911.* I couldn‚Äôt think straight at this point, the house was getting so warm. As it got darker outside, I couldn‚Äôt tell if what I was seeing were eyes outside, or lights from the house distorted in the glass reflections. I felt bloated, like I was being pumped with hot air. It was so sudden, it felt like I was becoming a sausage. *Why did I drink this much?*

I then felt a sudden unearthly tiredness that overcame me. I was too sleepy and stumbling to even make it to my old bedroom. I laid out on the couch and crashed, hard. I don't remember what I dreamt about, but it smelled of decay. And our two dogs were there, Cocoa and Hershey. They were black labs mixed with blue heeler, adopted the day we moved onto this property. I‚Äôd known them my whole life until I was twelve. I dreamt of them often. But I never dreamt of Honey.

Honey was a cousin or something to Cocoa and Hershey, I don't know how, but she was bred by the same neighbor, Jake Duke on the north side of the property. A late addition to our little family. Honey was an inbred golden lab mix, her parents were siblings. Honey never acted quite right. Cocoa and Hershey, untrained but perfect as they were, always trailed behind us in a single-file line when we went on family walks, the cats and trusting chickens following close behind the two dogs in turn. But Honey would stop and squat to take a shit right in front of you on the path, oblivious you‚Äôd walk straight into it. Hershey once brought home a dying baby bunny in her mouth that she found, gentle and maternal, giving it to me to take care of (it died anyway). Cocoa once nearly gave his life protecting the free roaming chickens from a red fox. But Honey wasn‚Äôt like that. Something wasn‚Äôt right with Honey.¬†

Things came to a breaking point when Honey attacked one of the ducks in the pond. She shook it to pieces in her mouth, blood and organs and feathers everywhere. While Honey was mauling this duck, Cocoa and Hershey were rounding up the other ducks and ducklings like the precious discount sheepdogs they were. My dad wouldn‚Äôt tolerate this, he couldn‚Äôt trust Honey anymore. What if Honey attacked me, too? Would my tiny hands and fingers be able to push her off? And my dad wouldn‚Äôt give her up to the pound so another unsuspecting family would have to deal with her. So, my dad took her up the hill in the forest, shotgun in hand, and once out of sight, but not out of earshot from me, he put a bullet between her eyes. Dad said a dog knows when you‚Äôre going to shoot it. Apparently she fought the rope every step up the hill.

When I woke up on the couch, it was so hot, I brushed off my gut feeling that I'd been watched through the large living room windows while I slept. I panicked and thought the furnace had automatically kicked on or something, but it hadn't. I got up and looked for a box fan, I'd be pissed if my dad had thrown it out. I was shocked I was still as drunk as I was before. When I passed his computer again to go for his office closet, I realized I might still be able to reach people after all. I could text the neighbors from his desktop. His password was still my name.

When I logged into his computer, I was startled. Deeply startled. My dad had been on reddit (not the scary part). On a new account, he'd posted a gory photo of his Jeep's fender dent, covered in blood, with a decapitated coyote on the side of the road. He'd uploaded it *weeks* ago, but he still had it open, as if he'd just posted it. There were a lot of comments. None answering his question. Maybe he was still checking for an answer.

*""I was angry something fell through last night. I had a few, saw this on the road, and swerved to hit it. Yeah, I'm an asshole. Not my finest moment. Any advice how I can get this dent out? It's not coming out no matter what I do.""*

The coyote had been hit in the throat, its neck torn open, head hanging back limply.

*Is he in his right mind?* *Why would he post this? This is unspeakable.* *He could have driven away and washed the blood off first. Why show the coyote? Why did he have to take a picture in that moment?*

I closed the internet browser and went to his messages. The most recent text was a reminder from my dad's doctor for his scheduled appointment tomorrow morning, he'd replied ""CONFIRM,"" as he had to every other appointment reminder before. I typed the name of our closest neighbor, Lucas Thompson, in the text search bar. Then I paused again.

My dad's last message to Lucas Thompson: *""Please buy it back. I'll take anything. I need to get off this property. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Tell me more about what happened to your dad.""*

Lucas Thompson: *""It‚Äôs too late. We all tried to warn you.""*

My dad: *""I'm not doing the oil drilling anymore. It wouldn't let us. Please call me.""*

I checked the paperwork on my dad's desk again. I hadn't read the contract properly the first time, I was too distracted. The contract authorizing oil drilling had actually been *canceled*. I thumbed through the contract, constantly losing my place from how my fingers shook. The ""Act of God"" clause of the contract was circled in yellow highlighter. Handwriting (that wasn't my father's) scribbled ""Reference incident report and 'Act of God' contractual reason for cancellation."" *What incident?* I couldn't find the incident report for the longest time. *Something about great bodily harm to the surveyor, but all these words are blurring together.*

I started to drunkenly text Lucas Thompson through the computer. It was as slurred as I was, full of typos. I had to start over a few times.

*""Lukas, this is earl. Perl. im here al one. can u chack onme""*

I hit send, then got up. At this point, I was too warm to function or process this more. A thick mucusy sweat was dripping down and rubbing between my fingers.

I was too hazy to notice that Mr. Lucas immediately texted back: *""You didn't deserve this.""*

I got up and searched through my dad's closet top and bottom, sloppily knocking everything over onto myself. Nothing. No fan. I was so hot I thought I'd die. But something told me to not open any windows. The humming and yakking outside wasn‚Äôt going away. It's not just that, I noticed something else ‚Äî the chirp of the insects and symphony of frogs outside, muted through the walls, would stop and start again. Start and stop. Start and stop. As if I was plugging my ears and taking my fingers out over and over. It was everywhere. And it was just getting *louder*.

I went to the bathroom and flushed my face with cold tap water. It smelled foul, the well water always smells foul. Something to root me to reality.¬†I gripped the sides of the sink. Outside, in the forest, the rumble and crack of a tree falling befuddled me, like a factory reset to my mind. In my entire life on Coyote Ridge Ranch, I had never heard a tree fall.

Then a second tree fell.

*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs coming?‚Äù*

I checked my phone. Two percent. *What would I even tell the cops?* Then I looked up from the sink to the dirty smudged mirror. I dropped my phone, and it cracked on the tile floor. I rubbed my eyes. My mouth had grown wider, impossibly so, my lips thinning and stretched. My eyes much smaller, and drifting apart like continents. I wiped the mirror clean, but the reality was only worse. When I‚Äôd look at my eyes, it looked like my mouth was growing. When I stared at my mouth, it was my eyes that were still changing. Like trying to track a floater in the corner of your vision, you swear you‚Äôre noticing something, but as soon as you focus on it, it darts away. My nose was sinking into my skin. I swear I wouldn‚Äôt miss that.¬†

I left the bathroom, stumbling as I scooped my phone back up. Still two percent. The house was impossibly stuffy, like the air was encasing me in a dry pressurized tomb. I desperately just wanted to open a screened door, I just wanted a breath of fresh air to think clearly. But my hearing was still overwhelmed. The unrhythmic droning (and coughing) was so loud, the staggered insects and frogs were so enveloping, my senses were entirely overstimulated. I went upstairs to the bonus room, sloppily, falling on my face a few times as I climbed. I ran to the back of the room, moonlight streaming through the small single window, and I propped it open with a book. As soon as the window slid up and hit the top, the barrage of noises outside stopped.

I didn't care. I breathed in the fresh air with my wide open mouth against the window screen, grateful to feel the wind on my tongue. I paused, and held my breath. Outside below me was the whining of a frail newborn kitten. A single one. It was soft, hungry, barely a sigh.

Despite my heat exhaustion, I felt my sweat run cold.

*Don‚Äôt go outside.*

*It‚Äôs trying to make you go outside.*¬†

My movements weren‚Äôt frantic and sporadic anymore. Calculated and cautioned, but still wobbly, I pulled a flashlight from a drawer, and slowly lifted it to the screen of the window. Nothing.

My chest hurt. Everything hurt. The acidic ballooning in my stomach and igneous constricting of my esophagus was only worse. This must have been the worst panic attack I‚Äôd ever experienced in my life because the physical toll was unbearable.¬†Some how, impossibly, I wasn‚Äôt sobering up. I was getting drunker.

My fingers fumbling with the screen, I slide my phone off airplane mode, ready to finally call someone, anyone. I couldn't justify toughing through this anymore. I couldn't be stoic like my dad.

The phone died in my hands. I held down all the buttons to power it back on, hoping for any semblance of a second chance. Probably in vain, but maybe it had just crashed, it was an old model, it crashed all the time. It was still at two percent.

Overwhelmed, I gripped my knees, and started vomiting. My vision was blacking in and out, I couldn‚Äôt see where I‚Äôd blown chunks, but some of it hit my bare legs. As I stood back up, swaying, I was perplexed. I felt so hot and corrosive inside. But whatever was coating my legs was ice cold. My vision still spotting, I swiped my hand on my leg and smelled it. It didn‚Äôt smell like bile and stomach acid and pesto. It smelled like dead fish.

*‚ÄúAlright, time to kill yourself Pearl.‚Äù*

I gripped the windowsill, trying to swallow a deep and helpless cry. Then paused. I was snapped out of my internal misery. My dad was outside, standing in the high grass of the field, shrouded by the halo of moonlight at his back. I couldn't tell if he was staring straight ahead into the void or directly up at me.

I lifted the flashlight to the window screen a second time, then immediately dropped it, no, *threw* it away. The moment my flashlight crossed his body, that's when I chucked it. *That is my father outside. But something is very, very wrong.* His mouth came down to his stomach, I don't know how to describe it, I didn't look at it long enough, I *wouldn't* look at it long enough. Ruby red blood ran down from under his chin, soaking his entire neck, like any skin past his ears had been flayed.

His eyes.

Something was wrong with his eyes. They weren't bloodshot, but they were flat, bulbous, and orange.

That's all I saw before I slammed the window shut. I sank to the floor, my back to the wall. I had to stay quiet. My tongue felt so large in my mouth, I couldn't gasp even if I wanted to.

*DING!* I jumped out of my skin.

Miraculously, my phone turned back on. One percent. I had a new text from several hours ago, one of the neighbors who doesn't speak to us.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""I saw your dad crashed his Jeep at the property line. I'm sorry.""*

I frantically typed: *""Hwat? hes hear! Helpm!""*

No response. I sent more.

*""Somethng,s happeggg! wh Y? Whats happenigg?""*

He texted back immediately.

JAKE DUKE (NORTH SIDE): *""It was probably Honey.""*

It died, for good.

*I need water. I need water on my skin, or I‚Äôll die.*

But when I ran back downstairs to the bathroom, the minerals in the well water burned my skin. I didn't care. I needed it so bad. Then, the water stopped running from the facet.

I had no choice.

I burst through the front door and ran into the night, toward the stock ponds. I tripped on the porch and fell on my face, it loosened my teeth but I didn't care, I kept going. I didn't care about the noises coming from behind me in the tall grass, or the yacking hum and drone that had come back, nothing mattered to me more than this thirst in my skin. But when the water came into view, I didn't take another step.

The large pond was still full of water, but the small stock pond had dried up. In the center of the empty pond, the normal corpses of my dad ‚Äî and *me* ‚Äî were lying, bloated, being consumed by hordes of red ants.

*""That's not me, I'm still here.""*

There was a third body sunk deeper in the fresh mud, much farther in decomposition than ours. Though it looked barely human ‚Äî at first, I thought I was looking at the corpse of a **maned wolf**. His arms and legs were char black, they'd been mutilated and extended. His bones jutted back and fanned from his spine, and orange fungus erupted from his skin. He had the same cleft palate that runs in Lucas Thompson's family.

I was slammed to my back, and dragged. The peaceful quilt of unpolluted stars passed above me in a blur. I screamed and twisted my body, frantic to break free from whatever had once been my dad. But the grip on my ankle and the swiftness I was dragged through the high grass was inescapable. I felt a fiery, chemical burning, like every plant irritant I touched absorbed into my skin and pumped through my system.

My shirt was catching on the thistles and brambles dragged under me, the naked skin of my back scraping like hell. I grabbed at the grass, desperate to stop wherever we were going, desperate to fight whatever was coming.

When I was forcefully pulled through an Alberta-rose bush, there was a new, horrific sensation. My arms and legs caught on the thorns, and I could feel large portions of my skin slopping off my body. I screamed even louder. The lower dermis on my arms and legs were exposed, like I was a peach being blanched. When that fell away, my muscles underneath were left open, dragging bare in the dust and rocks. The long, unbroken shriek that left my lungs felt inhuman ‚Äî but still inaudible over the humming that might split my head open, coming from whatever became of my dad. But even in the darkness under the moon, the color wasn‚Äôt right. My muscles weren't pulpy pink and red, my flesh under my skin was black and puss yellow.¬†I vomited again as my head thrashed back and forth. I spewed wads of viscus leaches all over my chest. They attached themselves to my exposed flesh, and swiftly burrowed winding trenches through open muscle as they ate me alive.

*I said I've only ever hurt an animal on purpose, one time...*

Once, I *did* push one of the cats off the roof. I heard they‚Äôd always land on their feet, so I wanted to see it. The cat was fine, as far as I know, I wasn't *trying* to hurt Herbie. Once, I did accidentally tear the wings off a dragonfly when I tried catching it in my hands ‚Äî though it seems it got even, because an hour later I was attacked by a swarm of wasps and sent to the hospital in anaphylactic shock. Once, one of the baby birds outside my window stopped eating, so I took it from its nest and forced food into its mouth with a tube. But I fed it too much, its little lungs aspirated, it chocked in my hands and died. The next day all the baby birds were gone. They weren‚Äôt old enough to fly away.

Once or twice, I did dissect a dead frog and a dead tiger salamander I found floating in the pond. I was so fascinated by their anatomy, I fell in love with amphibians.¬†

*But once... Only one time... I can remember when I was eleven, I became fixated on how cool I thought ducks were* ‚Äî *the webbing in their feet and the delicate feathers in their wings. I wanted so badly to dissect one* *and see the tendons in their wings. One of the ducklings was sick. I checked on it everyday, but it wouldn‚Äôt die fast enough‚Ä¶*

The rotting skin of my dad's arms and back were scabbing and crumbling into a flaky and vivid gangrene. My dad's long hanging mouth and open bleeding throat fused into a single fleshy and narrow mandible, his teeth detached and flowing down from his jaw and jutting out both sides like a serrated beak. His arms, they weren't just growing, both arms were *fraying* apart ‚Äî like stick cheese being pulled five ways at the base and curled down. Each finger split apart from his hand, each peeling back individual tendons, separating muscle. It bisected and splintered his bones, he cried out as the sponge and viscera of his bone marrow leaked out in a pulpy grey and purple mass. What his arms were now fanned and folded, like wings.

*Well, I was so afraid to get in trouble with my dad, that once I was finished, I put the dissected duck in Honey‚Äôs mouth.*

*That night, the coyotes came and woke me, and the quiet footsteps approached.*

*The next year, Cocoa and Hershey were both hit by two different drunk drivers.*

I was dragged into the murky pond water. My dad seized me by my throat with what remained of his hands, and shook me up and down under the water, callously drowning me. Water and slimy algae flooded my throat and my lungs. I clawed at his face, unrecognizable from the man who I loved most, the man who always swore to protect me. Hornwort weed entangled around my wet slippery fingers as I tried to push him off. But my fingers weren‚Äôt mine anymore. None of this was mine.

While I thrashed and fought blindly and terrifyingly for my life, my mind began to slow down and disassociate. His humming drone was finally muted with my ears underwater. My internal voice felt cold and echoey ‚Äî like thought was unnecessary to the outcome of my circumstances. Or maybe that thought wasn‚Äôt a part of me anymore.

*How do these perfectly working little ecosystems spring up?* I thought in academic detachment. *My dad filled these ponds himself with a pump and a hose, but they‚Äôve got leeches, tiger salamanders, water bugs, and cat tails all on their own. As if they were always here.*

With his mouth, my father sliced my abdomen open. Where my ovaries should have been, fish eggs spilled out. But they weren‚Äôt fish eggs, there were tiny salamanders wriggling and squirming inside.¬†

The voice in my mind went quieter and quieter, drifting far away from my reach. Until I could barely hear it at all:

*The crime in Red Deer wasn‚Äôt all that bad.*¬†",6,1755968018.0,creepcast,10,0.81,False

I know that returning to the place where this all happened was an objectively horrible idea but these memories have plagued me ever since they began to resurrect in my mind. I thought I needed concrete answers of some sort, whatever form that took.¬†

The drive to Racine was relatively uneventful. Nine hours of coffee and fast food fueled highway and I was back in the city by the time the sunset painted Lake Michigan in a deep, orange hue. Returning to the city brought about a plethora of feelings. Nostalgia, disgust, dread, but mostly apathy as befits this place. The place had changed in many ways and in many ways it was the exact same. I think the only real thing I realized upon crossing back into the city limits is that living somewhere for a year when you were a child does not qualify you to know that place. Racine is just as alien to me now as when we first moved into that house.

I obviously didn't remember the address of the old house but my dad was able to find it on some old tax document and he texted it over to me. When I arrived in the old neighborhood, I was shocked to see just how much my memory had failed me. The neighborhood was not exactly as nice as I remembered. Many vacant houses filled the streets and some plots were even completely empty. I didn‚Äôt remember that much empty space before. I pulled up along my old house to find it vacant as well. It surprised me a bit. I‚Äôm sure my parents sold it off to someone before moving. They must have not been able to do the same before fleeing the town themselves. What surprised me even more than that was what I found across the street.

The plot was empty. Not as if a house was burned or torn down. It's like nothing had ever been built. Tall waving grass flowed free in between yellow and purple wildflowers. I stared over the lots into and over the tree line. That's where the tall house should've been. All I saw was empty air. A cloudless orange sky.¬†

I gave my mom a call as I sat in the car looking at the grassy plot of land. She didn‚Äôt pick up this time, unfortunately. I stared at the empty lot for a long time. As if Mrs. Rand‚Äôs odd white house would suddenly be there after a blink. When it never appeared I got out of my car, leaving it parked on the curb. I walked the neighborhood for a long time, eventually deciding to take the bike path through the woods, back to the humble park where I believe this all began.¬†

Arriving at the playground filled me with feelings I couldn‚Äôt quite place. The upkeep had clearly grown very relaxed over the years as wild grasses and weeds took over the place. My eyes locked on the spot where I first saw Cory. Where I shook his hand and he pranced around like a maniac. I can hear him now still chanting that I was in the ‚Äò*weird*‚Äô. I almost laughed to myself at the memory. The absurdity of it all. The craziness of being back here after all this time. One soft exhale out of my nose and I turned to walk back. Cory was standing on the pathway.¬†

I nearly jumped out of my own skin as I saw him. The thing that made my mind writhe wasn‚Äôt only that he looked the exact same after all these years but that the very sight of him made me realize in my heart of hearts that it was all real. It all happened. And the monster who made it happen was standing before me.

‚ÄúBen. It‚Äôs good to see you. I almost thought you‚Äôd never come *home*.‚Äù His happy, childlike cadence was gone despite his static appearance. I wondered if that had been a facade the whole time. That whatever he was did that to communicate best with us. My skin crawled at the thought. My voice caught in my throat when I tried a response. What could I even say to him? To this *thing*?

‚ÄúThe house is gone.‚Äù I finally said with more confidence than I felt. It was weird looking and talking down at him. As if I should have reverted back to a small child in his presence.¬†

‚ÄúUnfortunately, yes. All things have to come to an end, Ben. That‚Äôs even true for *weirds*. Maybe *especially* true. The neighborhood is all dried up now. No more new children who need to be watched. I do wish you could have seen it though. It was such a beauty by the end. How *high* it had gotten. Nearly to the clouds it felt like.‚Äù he said, a content grin painted across his face. I shook my head stupidly. I was caught in confusion, fear, and awe all at the same time and my mind was a cobwebbed maze I had to fight to get through, let alone use.¬†

‚ÄúJasper, Lucas, Ethan‚Ä¶ Sarah‚Ä¶‚Äù I started, not finding any real footing in my words. ‚ÄúWhere are they? What happened to them?‚Äù

Cory kept wearing his grin and shook his head. As if to say ‚Äò*fool*‚Äô. As if to mock me with the title: ‚Äò*foundationless dreamer*‚Äô.¬†

‚ÄúI was wrong about you, Ben.‚Äù he said, dropping the grin. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have to make your choice after all.‚Äù¬†

He was gone with a blink. I darted around looking for him, but he was nowhere. What was the tone that filled those last words? Was it anger? Contempt? *Jealousy* even? I would never know. The walk back through the woods and to the neighborhood was a haunted one. Cory's and Mrs. Rands and wax figures hid behind every tree and walked behind me until I turned.¬†

When I emptied back into the suburb it stank of rotten nostalgia. The sunset was heavy with the final colors of the day. Dusk threatened the sky and night would soon make its claim. I found myself back at my car staring at the lot where Mrs. Rand‚Äôs house had been for a whole summer when my phone rang in my pocket. Mom.¬†

‚ÄúHey mom.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHey, sorry I missed your call. Is it about the Pok√©mon cards again? I‚Äôm still looking for them but I‚Äôll let you know if they turn up!‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about em‚Äô. Hey, I‚Äôm sorry for asking again, but do you remember that white house I mentioned directly across the street? Like, directly?‚Äù I asked. She thought for a moment before the inevitable answer came.

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so. I remember that plot being empty for the time we were there. A lot of plots were. Part of the reason we moved was the lack of money going through that part of town. Why do you ask?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo reason.‚Äù I said, staring into the waving grass. ‚ÄúSo I never went over there during that summer?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you would. With that friend of yours. The little boy you had made friends with. The one with the scar, you remember? You would play that strange game where you would stand, staring out at the forest and he would kind of jump around you. I thought it was the oddest thing and you were never really good at explaining it when I asked. But it was right across the street and you seemed to have fun.‚Äù

I let a long silence build as I stared at the field, imagining Cory staring back.

‚ÄúBen? Are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, mom.‚Äù I said, hanging up the phone.¬†

I imagined the tall house off over the trees. I saw it in my mind‚Äôs eye reaching up and up, the roof not even visible anymore. I imagined Lucas and Jasper and Ethan all being posed the question and having to give an answer, the door no longer part of their world. I imagined the wax people coming during their farce of a night and taking them to wherever nightmares lived. I got in my car and drove away. I never plan on coming back to Racine and I think I‚Äôll do my best to re-forget all of this. In my heart I know that will be an impossible task.¬†

The entire, dark drive back home was a new haunt of its own. In between exits and county signs and the yellow glow of street lights, I was plagued with one thought. The thought of how I would have answered Cory‚Äôs choice were the door to disappear on me one day. Were my house added to the colorful tower that was the tall house. Were its lights to come on the day before I disappeared into the unknown. Would I have *danced*? Would I have been *cut*? Or would I have *remained*, as Sarah chose.

Heads up‚Äîwe need to find someone very soon, so we're looking to make a decision in the next day or two.

The House & Amenities: The base rent is $800 per month, plus utilities, which usually run about $50-$100. You‚Äôll have your own private bedroom in a house that‚Äôs perfect for student life.

What We're Looking For: We're all UCR students who are serious about our academics but also love a relaxed and social home.

We want someone who wants a calm, welcoming home but is also happy to hang out sometimes. Unfortunately, we can't have any pets due to allergies.

Landlord Relationship: To make things easy, I handle paying the landlord and utilities so you don't have that hassle. We‚Äôre also always happy to share rides to campus or the store.

1my6h6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1my6h6n/experience_the_ultimate_brewing_speed_with_bunn/,Experience the ultimate brewing speed with BUNN CSB3T coffee maker review!,"The BUNN 55200 CSB3T Speed Brew Platinum Thermal Coffee Maker is a product that delivers on the promise of speed and convenience. As someone who values efficiency in the kitchen, I found its 4-minute brewing time for a full 10-cup carafe absolutely remarkable. This machine immediately stood out to me for its sleek stainless steel and matte black finish, which fits seamlessly into modern home design while adding a touch of professionalism.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker exudes durability. The combination of its sturdy stainless steel tank and matte black finish doesn‚Äôt just look good; it feels solid and reliable. The double-walled thermal carafe, designed to keep coffee hot for over two hours, has been a lifesaver during busy mornings when multiple cups are non-negotiable. The compact dimensions make it a perfect fit even in moderately sized kitchens. Unlike some bulkier coffee machines, it doesn‚Äôt look out of place or clutter up the counter.

**Ease of Use**  
Navigating this machine has been surprisingly simple. Its pour-in bowl with a water-level indicator ensures precision every time I add water, and the manual operation mode feels refreshingly straightforward‚Äîa throwback to when kitchen gadgets prioritized function over unnecessary flashiness. The flip-lid brewing mechanism makes brewing instantaneously engaging. It‚Äôs worth noting that the taller funnel ensures minimal spills, which is a game-changer, especially when rushed.

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
With Speed Brew technology, this model doesn't rely on the traditional ‚Äúburp‚Äù method of boiling water over coffee grounds; instead, it stores hot water in a commercial-grade tank. This approach produces consistent, piping hot coffee without compromising on flavor. I managed to fill a travel mug within 2 minutes and enjoy a full carafe of robust coffee in just 4 minutes. Its regulated temperature system maintains the optimal 200¬∞F, unlike some competitors‚Äô models that accidentally overheat and scorch the coffee. These features pushed this coffee maker into a category of its own.

[Check BUNN 55200 CSB3T Speed Brew Platinum price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07gy6phyz/)

**Key Benefits**  
- A commercial-grade stainless steel water tank keeps 70 oz of water always hot.  
- Brews at an impressive speed: 20 oz in 2 minutes, 10 cups in 4 minutes.  
- Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for 2+ hours.  
- Designed with an enhanced multi-stream spray head for caf√©-quality flavor.  
- Attractive design combining matte black and polished stainless steel.  

**Negatives**  
While I‚Äôve had a mostly positive experience, there are a few nitpicks.  
- The machine always requires the tank to be filled, which might waste energy when making coffee occasionally.  
- BUNN filters are not standard size, so replacements can be a hassle if you run out unexpectedly.  
- No programmable features like timers, which might bother tech lovers.

**Hurdles**  
- Commitment to keeping the machine plugged in for instant readiness.  
- Limited adaptability with specific coffee grounds.  
- Potential learning curve for first-time users to understand the water capacity and brewing speed.  

**Competing Brands**  
Against competitors like Cuisinart and Technivorm, this coffee maker holds up well in terms of speed and thermal insulation. However, it sacrifices programmable options and certain modern features that Cuisinart users often rave about. Compared to Technivorm‚Äôs consistent build quality, the BUNN model carves its space with performance speed and simplicity, though it lacks some customizations. Where this BUNN offering shines is in consistently delivering piping hot coffee without the wait time typical of more traditional models.

**Bang for the Buck**  
In terms of value for money, this product packs a lot of perks into a reasonably accessible package. Some might argue that the lack of smart features doesn‚Äôt justify investing at this level, but for me, the unparalleled speed and caf√©-like quality make it more than worth consideration. While cheaper alternatives exist, they often fail to match the BUNN's thermal carafe build or its speed. You‚Äôre truly paying for efficiency and dependability, two elements that kitchen perfectionists like myself demand.

Nataly strode into Martin's workshop, her feet clinking on the ground. It was late, and her eyelids were heavy. The hum of the AC in the halls was like a lullaby to her. But it was the first time in the week that she's been able to talk privately with Martin, and so she couldn't let the chance go. The doors to his private lab slid open, revealing the room he spent his nights in. What a mess, she thought. Coffee cups littered the floor, a few drops trickling onto the ground. He had his computer running, and there were several mechanical parts on the table, organized into small heaps. How the several heaps were different from each other, she could not tell at all.

''Sit down. I've got some new things to show you.'' Martin went over to his computer, turned it on, and started clicking furiously. In between his clicking, he leaned on the table, grabbed a cable, and plucked it into his chest. That was unnerving, she thought, but continued looking the room over. She looked at the small couch, the only place she could sit on except the chair Martin was currently occupying. It was littered with dirty clothing and other things like food packaging and scraps, even some scrap parts he'd discarded. She could see some crumbs and coffee in between the cushioning, even from afar.

''This place is a mess, Martin. You need to clean up.'' She walked over to him and poked him in his chest when he turned. ''And I'd rather die than sit on that dirty couch.''

He looked over and gave her what must have been an apologetic smile. ''Sorry. Where are my manners? Here.'' She watched him try his best cleaning the couch, and fail miserably at it. She still found herself smiling and appreciating his hospitality. Martin, now finished, walked back to the computer and continued typing. She sat down, took out her phone, and scrolled through the news for a bit.

She continued scrolling until one article made her pause. Her finger paused above the screen. She hadn't expected the incident to go public.

<The protectors of Neodrius were slain by unknown rebels.>

Neodrius - Violence erupted in Sector 14 as the security forces of Neodrius patrolled the city. The scale of the carnage is unprecedented, with over twenty officers found dead. The council of the city of Neodrius warns about late-night strolls and the dangers of associating with criminal organisations.

Eyewitness reports state that the security forces employed non-lethal gas and taser weapons before being forced to switch to lethal weapons. The spokesperson of....




The article went on about how the criminal organisations were plaguing the city, and more lies about how they were endangering the citizens of Neodrius. She felt herself fume with rage, the lies of the bastards endlessly going on.

''Here, come look!'' Martin half-shouted, not looking away from the computer. Pulling out the e-cig to calm her nerves, she walked over, trying to see what was on the screen. A schematic was displayed on the desktop, several lines angling out of it. They spoke about materials, components, and some calculations she didn't understand. She recognized the vague shape of the schematic itself, though.

She could barely contain her excitement. ''Is that a new arm?''

''Sure is! Do you like it?'' Martin grinned from ear to ear, and Nataly could feel her heart flutter. He had such a beautiful smile. He smelled of caramel, the fragrance filling the air from almost a meter away. Probably a new cologne. She liked that he took care of himself when it came to things like smells, but she wished he'd take care of himself sleep-wise as well. She'd force him to eventually.

'I.. I don't know what I'm looking at, to be honest.''

Martin scratched his chin. ''Well, the circuitry makes the whole system less laggy, because it...''

''Martin, no tech-jumble. Please. Just tell me about it straight.''

His smile fell a bit, but he nodded. Nataly had no time for hour-long explanations that she wouldn't understand anyway.

''The materials the schematics talked about. They are lighter than what we use. The way their bodies work is different, too.''

She raised her eyebrows. She liked the part about the arms being lighter, though. Her shoulders still ached sometimes.

''And this is useful to us because?''

''Because,'' he dragged on the word, ''it allows us to store more in them without your arms bulking to twice the size of mine. Look here, see this?''

She did see, but didn't understand what it was that he was showing her. Her expression must have given her confusion away, because he continued on.

''The components bend on themselves, Nataly. In ways I've never seen, or have not been possible before.''

She nodded. ''So you need materials? What are they?''

His eyes met hers then. ''A lot of them, a whole list. Problem is, they are not sold to normal people, not even the middle city ones. Only to Ristard guards.''

Realisation struck her. ''You can't mean.. You're an idiot if you think you can get away with that, Martin. It's suicide.''

Martin just smirked. ''Good thing I'm bringing the fastest thief around then.''

-----------------------------

Spike whispered to Viktor's ears with wanton need. Now. He broke out in cold sweat, tightened his jaw, and clenched his fists. Stood still for a sec.

He didn't listen, but it was harder than it used to be. He used to take drugs every day. What a bloody ride that was. But he couldn't stop Spike from being an annoyance, even after all these years. Little fucker should be a part of him, sitting in his skull, yet it acted like a princess, commanding him like a mutt. The thought made him remember Lady, the black lab they used to feed at Thomas' hideout. Little runt was too good for that place, and always cheered him up when he was feeling the itch. She'd exchange them all for a can of meat, though. He smiled at the memory of feeding her, the dog's greying mouth opening to lick his fingers whenever he fed her. Hopefully, the Decks didn't kill her along with the gang. They couldn't be that heartless, right? He'd try to remember to ask Martin the next chance he got.

Neither Martin nor Nataly came to eat with him these past three days, saying they were too busy. How could they be pissing themselves all over with so many folks in the Silver Deck? Or was it something else? He'd not pissed them off, hopefully. He couldn't recall anything like that. Wait, maybe it was the soup? Or the cards? Or maybe... No, better not think about it. He used to make some folk angry by just being himself. It better not be the case, he was starting to like them. Without much to do in the mornings, he took to trying this thing they called socializing. It was hard.

Most mornings, he ate by himself and talked to George if he could see him at the armory. The dude was always smiling. His beard made him look older than he was, so much so that even Viktor had trouble telling if he was older or not. He met his wife, too. She was a pretty lady, all smiles and giggles. He instantly liked her and could feel the connection the two had. They bickered like an old couple, but it was mostly Timothea throwing jokes at George. It was freeing, seeing him made fun out of for a change.

''The chemist is busy, but he'll come. Probably before the end of the week. I'll do what I can.'' He said that two days ago, but nobody has shown up yet. Viktor brought it up ever since, just to be sure.

After that, he usually went to see Eva before starting work, and he did just that today. He was going to be late. But fuck it, they weren't gonna kill him for fucking up one time. He made exactly zero progress with Eva these past few days. Well, she finally remembered his name, but he couldn't really call that amazing. He still came, though. He remembered how every relationship he's ever had went to shit. He'd do his best to not let this one end like that. Eva listened to him talk whenever she was free. Better said, she listened to him try to talk. He stuttered like one of 'em busted neon signs on sector 2. But he tried, made jokes, and surprise to him, Eva even laughed sometimes.

He never got around to asking her on a date like he promised himself. Was now a good time? He felt cold, afraid of starting the sentence. What if she didn't care for him? Or just thought him dumb, like the rest? No. He'd have to.

''Eva... I.. I..''

The door swung open, Martin standing there like a statue.

Booming laughter echoed throughout the lab. Even though the joke was, as always, aimed at his expense, Viktor laughed as well. George had that effect, same as Martin - tension didn't survive in his presence. The smell of coffee mixed in with oil clung to him wherever he went like a second shirt, and Viktor wasn't gonna complain about it. After a lifetime spent immersed in the terrible smells of the city - the trash on the streets, the sweat mixed with U-Rize, the acidic rain - the clean and sythetic smells of the Silver Decks bunker unsettled him.

Sipping on his coffee, he looked at the machine again. Trying to insert blockers into the nano-drug proved to be next to impossible, even with the equipment that the Deck could provide. The robots were just too tiny, and the concoction of drugs they moved in was unstoppable without a strong sense of self-control. He was stuck. Miss Nataly wouldn't take kindly to no new progress, especially after bailing him out of his home prison, but what could he do?

A hand touched his shoulder. ''Hey, so I know you're trying to make the nano-bots better to limit the drug, but why not try to do it the other way around?''

He scrunched his eyebrows. What did he mean? And then understanding struck him.

''Ya want to make the drug's speed better? But It's fast enough, i can tell ya that. And Miss Nataly wanted other people 'ta use it, it's what she..''

''Yes, I know, she wants to use it on all the Decks, but this could be useful as well, right? As far as I can see, the blockers aren't feasible.'' George paced and looked at the synthetic drugs, sorted in small vials. ''But what if a few of our people can simply tolerate it, like you do?''

''Sorry, man, ya don't look like much of a runner, gotta be honest.''

George smirked and looked at his belly. His shirt hugged him tightly, and that was enough of a response. ''No, I'm not talking about myself.''

Scratching his chin, Viktor continued. He'd have to shave that stubble. ''So, ya want to make us even faster? But it's fast enough, I don't go at full speed m'self''

''No, not faster. But longer. Lower the toll on the body, dissipate the side-effects.'' A glint in his eye, George looked at the vials again.

Viktor nodded, seeing the opportunity in the idea. But he would have to disappoint George this time around. ''I'm not much of a chem, George. I mixed the drugs when off in the clouds at U-Rize one night. We'd need an actual chem.''

Picking up his phone, George took two steps away and smiled at him. ''Got it. A chemist you will receive.'' Someone must have picked up the call, as he went quiet. After a few moments, he went and talked with this person quietly, nodding to himself a few times. Was there a chemist in the Deck? Why wasn't he helping already? George was talking amiably with the fella, and was smiling while at it too, so that was a good sign at least. Making it last longer, huh. Would be great. He could push it to about fifteen seconds if he went a bit slower, but making it last longer would allow him to do so much more. He still needed to put some blockers in, though, or create a machine that stopped the skull implant after a set amount of time.

The door to the lab hissed open, turning both of the men's heads. Nataly stood in the doorway, her black, ornamented outfit stiff with blood. Her arms were almost completely covered in dried-up blood, coloring a few spots of the outfit a shade darker. Her black hair was messy, strands of it stuck to her face by the blood. Her feet clinked on the ground as she walked closer to them like a countdown. Viktor's pulse spiked.

''Hey, scrub. Glad to see you working already. Seems like George got you cleared?''

''Yes, Miss Nataly. He's a nice fella.''

''Good. Any progress?''

He scratched his head. ''Can't put limiters on the nano-robots, but we are trying other things.''

She breathed out, massaging her temples. ''That's alright. Martin will come help out tomorrow. He asked me to get you two. Had dinner yet?''

George's voice carried over from where he was still on the call. ''Timothea took my serving home already, so no, thanks. But come see me for coffee when you can!''

A smile appeared on Nataly's face. Now that was a rarity, Viktor thought. ''Will do. Well then, let's go, Viktor.''

Martin, Nataly, and Viktor ate slowly, talking quietly throughout the late dinner. Viktor didn't even realize how tired until his eyelids stopped listening to his commands. The two of them looked mighty more tired than he did, though, which was understandable, as he mostly just spent his day thinking about stuff in his bed. They didn't talk about this night's action. He itched to ask about the bodies he saw being carried away from the elevator, but he bit his tongue. How many have died? Viktor wanted to ask so badly, but he could feel the energy in the room. Their mood. It would just make them angry, sad, or both. So they talked about different things. Viktor mostly talked about all the drugs he tried in the last decade.

''And that's why they stopped selling Big Bertha, I tell ya. It just made ya too smart.'' Viktor finished and shoved the last piece of his meal into his mouth. It was some kind of meat mixed with herbs, eggs, and flour. Cold now, but still delicious. The water was mixed with some kind of syrupy substance, and that at least hid the lack of taste of the water here. He missed the metallic tang on his tongue.

Martin just chuckled on his last retelling, and then straightened, stretching out. Damn, was he muscular.

''Alright, listen, scrub.'' Nataly leaned in and looked him dead in the eye. She looked so tired that she wasn't even scary to him. Well, no, she was just a bit less scary than usual. ''We need the nano-drug in a week. We're meeting some people, and we're not sure if it's a trap or not.''

''It probably isn't.'' Martin groaned, still stretching.

''But it might be. You never know when the Flames are involved.''

""Viktor‚Äôs chair screeched as he bolted upright. ‚ÄòThe Eben Flames? Their rides are almost as fast as me on Spike!‚Äô The silence that followed made him realize that he must have made some kind of mistake, and he sat back down. He realized the reason why they might not be so enthusiastic. ‚ÄòAh. Right. Deck and Flames‚Ä¶ not friendly?‚Äô""

Martin sighed. ''It's a bit more complicated than that, but we're not friendly, no.'' He scratched his head and continued on. ''We're going to a meeting, and we don't know their goals, or even what the point is. Only Damian does, and he didn't tell us any info if he got some. So we need every advantage we can get in case things go awry.'' His eyes shifted to Nataly's arms, and now it was his turn to massage his temples. ''I'll do what I can to prepare us as well. Will probably have to say goodbye to my sleep schedule though.''

''As if you had one'' Nataly said, deadpan. She was using some kind of gel to clean her hands.

''Hey, I love sleeping.'' He lowered his head and changed his tone to a sad one. ''It's just that there's so much to do.''

''I can help ya if ya need anything,'' Viktor said. He smiled when he looked at him. ''Just don't expect me to not fuck it up, ya know?''

''I'll take you on that offer, actually. Need to go somewhere in the inner city, maybe in two or three days' time. You in?''

He didn't expect that, but he already said he'd go, so what could he do? Hopefully, it wasn't anything bothersome. ''Sure, man.''

Standing up, Martin just nodded. ''Sounds good. I'll tell you when to be ready. And wear something that's not our colors. We need to fit in. Nataly, can I show you something in my lab now?''

Aaaand that was his clue to go. He stood up, said his goodbyes, and headed straight to his room. He was about to shit his pants anyways. He locked himself in, took a dump, showered, and lay in his bed. The ideas about what would happen with Martin tomorrow battered his mind, but not for long.

1my6ehj,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1my6ehj/divvying_up_partner_time_in_garden_party_poly/,Divvying up partner time in garden party poly?,"I am newer to practicing polyamory, I have a spouse/nesting partner and a secondary partner Juniper I've been dating for a few months. Juniper and I have been part of the same dance community for a while (let's say bachata) and we attend lessons and dances both separately and together as dance partners. Juniper's primary partner Arbor and her secondary Cedar are salsa dancers curious about learning bachata. Since we all run in the same dance community we have been moving towards a garden party dynamic as we'd prefer to all be friendly than avoid events the others are attending for both practicality and a desire to have a healthy polycule. 

The dance studio was having their quarterly student showcase and it happened to fall on mine and Juniper's date night. We were scheduled to be part of the showcase and then watch our classmates perform. Someone I just started dating, Evergreen, wanted to come because they are about to start bachata classes and we might become dance partners. So, I did my thing as a hinge, explaining they were welcome but I'd be focused on my performance with Juniper and would probably only have time for a quick hello. Both them and Juniper were fine with this.

Arbor and Cedar also wanted to come.  We have all met before but this was our first polycule double date of sorts. Juniper and I discussed how to interact with them and agreed since it's our date and performance night, we would greet them and be friendly, but keep the focus on our time together and they would do the same with each other. We talked about levels of PDA, that a hug and kiss greeting was ok with me but not more, and I asked that Juniper not go off with just Arbor for an extended period of time.

We ended up arriving a bit late, had time to greet Arbor and Cedar and then had to go prep for the performance, which took about 20 minutes. It went really well, we got lots of compliments from the other dancers! Juniper was feeling a bit of sensory overwhelm afterwards from performance nerves so we went outside for a bit to reconnect and get air, for probably 15 or so minutes. When we got back inside, our bachata friends all wanted to catch up so we mostly chatted with them, as well as with Evergreen and her friend. The event space had two rooms, one for salsa one for bachata + student performances, and we were going between each. At one point we passed Arbor and Cedar and I gave them a little smile and wave. We didn't really interact with them again until it was time to leave, I made a comment to Arbor about ""take good care of Juniper, her feet hurt after all that dancing!"" and then left.  All in all we were there for about 90 minutes total.

Discussing it afterwards, Juniper let me know that Arbor had struggled with the lack of interaction and felt that her and Juniper were acting ""more like exes"" than partners. I told Juniper I followed her lead on the amount of interaction with Arbor and she reassured me that we all did what we agreed to, gave each other space for our dyad dates, but it just didn't feel great for Arbor and she'd prefer we all interact more in the future. Juniper also struggled a bit seeing Arbor and Cedar show PDA with each other. This was Juniper and Arbor's first time being on dates with secondary partners in the same space. Juniper is of course handling their end of things as the hinge but I am not sure what \*I\* want in the future.

I personally thought the parallel-ish garden party setup worked well, in that we all acknowledged each other and shared space but J and I focused on our date and dance performance as intended. Since Arbor and Juniper get 3-4 nights together as primaries and I get 1 night a week with Juniper, I feel like if a group event falls on our date night and is going to turn into a group hang, then maybe I would want a separate date night where the focus is just on us? 

One the one hand I would like to get to know Arbor better so we can interact more naturally during these events and so they would feel ok approaching us next time if they were feeling excluded, which would have been fine with me. However I also feel like perhaps Arbor and Juniper need to figure out how to be more comfortable sharing space while not being on a date together so that those emotions don't become the focus, if we're really going to do garden party. I was admittedly a little sad to hear Juniper felt conflicted about how things went because our dance performance went SO well and was so well received, and I just wanted to bask in that afterglow together a bit. That made me think parallel would be wiser for the time being?

We are all committed to having healthy relationships but I'm not sure what this should look like here. I suggested a more planned low key group hang of some kind like dinner, not meeting in a club environment. Juniper brought up me having coffee with Arbor. I sort of get the sense she is intimidated by or nervous around me, though I try my best to be friendly and warm to her.

FYI, We are most likely to use same/similar beans once we know what we like and probably make the same type of coffee‚Äôs with minimal experimenting. 

Main queries: 
Auto Milk Wand‚Äî Is the auto foam from the Touch(s) actually good? Cafe quality?
Or 
do people end up doing it manually anyways for more cafe quality texture? Will have to stand there holding it though!
Is the steam wand on the Pro good enough?

Baratza Grinders - the touch impress has these but does the Pro has these too? Does it make any difference to an average person? Should it justify the price difference?

Impress Feature - does it actually leads to 0 mess? Do people still have to press/fix it manually later?
Is the dosing funnel in the Pro enough to make it mess free?

Screen - is it useful if you make similar drinks daily?
I got a feeling we might experiment with the beans a little bit in the first year and then we might know what we like and stick to it. 

Anything else I am missing which could justify the price difference?

1my6acv,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1my6acv/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Explore the Best Espresso Machine Breville Barista Touch Worth It,"Testing the Breville BES880BTR1BUS1 espresso machine, also known as the Barista Touch, has been a satisfying experience, though there are some points to consider. For someone like me, who starts the day with a strong, aromatic shot of espresso and dabbles with latte art on weekends, this machine has been an exciting addition to my kitchen. It's the kind of product that makes even a mediocre home brewer feel like a barista in the making, but not without quirks.

**User-Friendly Design with a Premium Touch**  
Right out of the box, the sleek ""Black Truffle"" finish caught my eye. There's something effortlessly elegant about the stainless-steel exterior, and the compact design made it look at home even in my limited counter space. Measuring 12.7 inches deep, 12.5 inches wide, and 16 inches tall, it doesn‚Äôt feel bulky despite its sturdy, 21.8-pound build. Operating the touch screen was an absolute treat. It‚Äôs intuitive, offering simple navigation through its three-step process: Grind, Brew, Milk. I found adjusting coffee strength, milk texture, and temperature as easy as swiping through my phone. Plus, the ability to save up to eight personalized drink profiles? A definite game-changer for families like mine, where everyone wants their coffee just right.

**Good Points**  
- The integrated conical burr grinder ensures freshly ground coffee with precision dose control.  
- ThermoJet heating system enables the machine to reach the optimal brewing temperature in just three seconds.  
- Automatic steam wand creates smooth microfoam for latte art and enhances coffee flavor.

**Performance Tailored to Coffee Enthusiasts**  
This espresso machine doesn‚Äôt just brew coffee; it brews *dreams.* The low-pressure pre-infusion gradually increases pressure, which results in a rich, well-balanced shot every time. Features like the PID temperature control help ensure that water temperature remains consistent, so I never found my espresso too hot or tepid. For someone who relishes the process of dialing in the perfect shot, the adjustable grind settings and precise extraction capabilities are stellar. That said, running the grinder can be a bit noisy‚Äînot deal-breaking, but something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre brewing early in a quiet household.  

**Expert Milk Texturing for Creative Souls**  
Milk frothing has been a genuine delight. The automatic steam wand produced barista-quality microfoam with minimal effort on my part‚Äîa real bonus when I tried replicating my favorite caf√©‚Äôs almond milk latte. I loved how customizable the milk texture and temperature are. Latte art? On point. If you‚Äôve ever struggled with achieving those silky swirls, this feature makes the effort feel effortless. It almost became a fun ritual for me during family brunches, where even the kids cheered on my foam creations.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Touchscreen operation simplifies the coffee-making process dramatically.  
- Built-in water tank with a generous 67-ounce capacity eliminates frequent refills.  
- Pre-programmed caf√© favorites allow quick brewing for classics like cappuccinos or flat whites.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The included cleaning kit is basic, considering regular maintenance is crucial for peak performance.  
- It might be overwhelming at first for novice users to fully utilize all customizable settings.  

**Competing Products**  
While exploring alternatives, I came across the DeLonghi Dinamica and the Jura E6, both vying for the attention of home baristas. The DeLonghi offers similar one-touch capabilities with a focus on simplicity, but lacks the precision of milk texture customization found in the Barista Touch. Meanwhile, Jura‚Äôs E6 brings sturdy Swiss craftsmanship to the table but misses out on the intuitive touchscreen interface and personalized drink profiles that make Breville‚Äôs machine so appealing. What sets this product apart is how it strikes a balance between sophistication and accessibility‚Äîfeatures that matter to both beginners and seasoned coffee lovers.

**True Value**  
This product isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd call an entry-level espresso machine, but for its feature set, it feels appropriately priced. In comparing it to some other super-automatic machines within a similar range, the Breville BES880BTR1BUS1 excels in versatility and ease of use. You‚Äôre not just paying for a coffee machine; you‚Äôre investing in an enhanced start to every morning and elevating your personal coffee game. The premium components and thoughtful design add a distinct sense of value over time.

As someone who uses Bluetooth headphones almost daily‚Äîfor work calls, gym sessions, or even while doing chores around the house‚Äîthe prospect of trying something with an open-ear design intrigued me. I'm used to the snug, noise-canceling kinds of earbuds, but these took a different approach altogether. The Shokz T910 immediately stood out for their unique setup, and there's a lot to talk about.

**Comfort and Fit**  
The open-ear design promised comfort, and honestly, it delivered. Instead of inserting buds into the ear canal, these sort of rest just outside, curving gently into place with those flexible ear hooks. At first, I was skeptical about how secure they‚Äôd be during a sweaty workout, but they stayed put. No awkward readjusting mid-jog or panic about them falling out. The silicone material felt soft, almost unnoticeable after a while. These really shine when you need to wear them for extended periods; my ears felt less fatigued compared to my regular earbuds.

**Audio Performance**  
If you're an audiophile expecting earth-shaking bass, you might not be blown away. However, the sound quality was solid‚Äîclear mids and highs, with a decent enough bass for casual listeners. The standout here was the trademark DirectPitch technology. The open-ear design meant I could enjoy my playlist while still being aware of the world around me. It‚Äôs perfect for outdoor jogging, where hearing nearby cars or cyclists is vital. But, and this is a small ""but,"" the sound does leak a bit. If you're in a quiet coffee shop, others might get a sneak peek at your guilty pleasure playlist.

**üí° [Check Shokz T910 price on Amazon.](https://soundcontroltech.com/p/b0bysqdwrt/)**  

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Battery anxiety is something I suffer from, so the fact that these offered up to 28 hours of total playback, including charges from the case, was genuinely reassuring. Seven hours per session already sounded good, but a five-minute quick charge for an additional hour of playtime? That saved me on more than one occasion. The charging case was lightweight and sleek‚Äîit slipped right into my bag without bulk.

**Build Quality and Durability**  
These headphones look and feel modern, with a minimalist black design that pairs well with both sportswear and everyday outfits. While they‚Äôre not something I‚Äôd want to take through a rainstorm, the sweat-resistant rating meant I didn‚Äôt have to baby them through my workouts. The plastic and silicone build felt durable, though ultra-light, which can sometimes come off as less premium.

**Strengths**  
- Open-ear design offers comfort for long use without ear fatigue.  
- Quick charge feature is perfect for fast top-ups on busy days.  
- The grip of the ear hooks ensures they stay secure during workouts.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Sound leakage can be an issue in quieter, shared spaces.  
- Bass response may not satisfy users used to heavier audio performances.  

**Peer Products**  
There are plenty of other open-ear headphones out there, like the Bose Sport Open Earbuds or even AfterShokz models. The Bose ones feel a bit heavier on the ear but do have a slightly richer sound profile, particularly with bass tones. Where the Shokz T910 shines, though, is its lightweight design and that 28-hour battery capacity‚Äîmany alternatives I tried didn't last as long. Compared to AfterShokz's recently released versions, the T910 edges ahead in comfort, especially with silicone cushioning. If hearing your surroundings is a top priority, Shokz nails that balance effortlessly. 

**Value for Money**  
Is it worth the price? I'd say it depends on what you're looking for.

Laundry days can often feel like a never-ending battle against stubborn stains, which is why I was pretty excited to test the OxiClean 757037400005. From spilled coffee on my work shirts to my kid‚Äôs grass-stained soccer uniform, I gave this stain remover a real workout to see if it lived up to its reputation. Spoiler alert: it mostly did. While there‚Äôs a lot to celebrate with this product, it‚Äôs not entirely perfect.

**Effectiveness on Stubborn Stains**

When it comes to battling set-in stains like grease, ink, and blood, this stain remover has some serious muscle. I tested it on a few weeks-old grease stains on a kitchen towel, and after pre-treating for just five minutes, the results were incredible‚Äîpractically no trace left after one wash! The same went for grass stains, which usually require re-washing with other products. The formula is bleach-free, which means I didn‚Äôt have to worry about discoloration on darker or more delicate fabrics like my son‚Äôs team jersey.

[Check OxiClean 757037400005 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b0bvy2xkjx/)

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

The spray bottle was a breeze to handle, and the 12-ounce size feels just right‚Äînot too cumbersome to hold but still lasting through multiple rounds of laundry. I really appreciated the flexibility of the pre-treatment window. Spraying stains and letting them sit up to seven days works wonders for my unpredictable schedule. Whether it was baby food stains on my niece‚Äôs clothes or clay smeared on my gardening pants, the product proved effective across a range of stains and fabrics.

**Boons**

- The formula is dye-free and chlorine-free, making it gentler for baby and kids‚Äô clothes.
- Works effectively on a wide variety of stains including food, wine, makeup, and ink.
- Safe to use on machine-washable whites and colorful fabrics without fading.
- Convenient 3-pack ensures you‚Äôre stocked and ready for unexpected messes.

**Packaging and Practicality**

One great aspect of this product is the practicality of its 3-pack packaging. That‚Äôs 36 ounces of stain-fighting power distributed into three easy-to-use bottles. I‚Äôve got one in the laundry room, another under the kitchen sink, and a third in the guest bathroom‚Äîbecause honestly, unexpected stains don‚Äôt announce their arrival. However, one minor annoyance was that the nozzle sometimes splattered instead of spraying in a fine mist, which could lead to uneven application on certain fabrics.

**Critiques**

- The spray nozzle could use improvement for better precision during application.
- Cannot be used on fabrics that require dry cleaning only.
- Requires setting your washer to the warmest water the garment allows, which isn‚Äôt feasible for certain delicate fabrics.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other popular stain removers like Shout or Zout, the OxiClean formula holds its ground in terms of power and versatility. I‚Äôve often found Shout to be less effective on older stains, while Zout struggles on fabrics like jeans or canvas. However, Zout comes with a more ergonomic nozzle for targeted application, which might attract users seeking ease of use. OxiClean brings the advantage of being dye- and chlorine-free, making it a safer option for brightly colored or delicate clothes.

**True Value**

Given its performance and the convenience of this 3-pack, it feels like a smart investment, particularly if you‚Äôre tackling lots of laundry or have young kids. The cost-to-quality ratio is impressive, and each bottle offers plenty of product to handle a continuous flow of messy situations. While it doesn‚Äôt do the impossible, like reviving already damaged fabric, it does handle day-to-day messes with efficiency.

I've seen that Datura and Substance also carry coffee from those farms and have other offerings too, both in the same price range and cheaper, so I could make a bigger order to lessen the impact of the shipping fee

I was wondering how these three roaster compare to each other in style (I was suggested these Datura and Substance for ultralight roasts, TPC offers ultralight only on some coffees for example), and if Substance and Datura ara worth the slight premium over TPC (cost per 100g is actually a bit higher)

Feeling really hurt and guilty about it.","I (29F) moved in with my husband (29M) and his parents about 2 months ago. My husband works long hours and usually doesn‚Äôt get home until after 7pm. We eat dinner with his family almost every night (his sister and her husband live nearby and join too). His parents are wonderful and very kind and I genuinely love them.

The problem is that I barely get any one-on-one time with my husband. On Sundays he comes home a bit earlier, but he hasn‚Äôt had a real day off since I moved in. I told him I‚Äôd like us to spend more time together, and for a while he made some effort (like doing little things after work), but it wasn‚Äôt consistent. Lately it‚Äôs back to the usual routine: dinner, then sitting with the family watching TV until bed.

Even his mom and sister sometimes tell him to take a day off and spend time with me, which honestly makes me feel embarrassed, like they pity me. I‚Äôve always been pretty emotionally independent, and I do have my own things to do (I am waiting to get a residency, I‚Äôm a physician), but I find myself watching the clock every night waiting for him.

This week his sister arranged for him to finally have a day off, and I was so excited to finally spend it together. But when we were talking about plans, he asked if it would be okay if his dad came with us. His dad is a great man and I love him, but I really want at least some time alone with my husband. For example, whenever we go to dinners, his dad always rides in our car (since MIL goes with SIL‚Äôs family). I‚Äôve always wanted to dress up, ride with my husband, maybe stop for coffee afterward ‚Äî but I rarely get those little couple moments. 

My husband says he likes taking his dad places because his dad worked hard all his life and didn‚Äôt get to do much for himself. I understand and respect that, but he had years before I came into the picture to do this. I can‚Äôt help but feel hurt that when he finally has a day off, his first thought is to invite his dad instead of wanting time with me.

And here‚Äôs the part that‚Äôs eating at me: I don‚Äôt even feel like saying anything to him now, because to me it feels like if he actually enjoyed my company, he wouldn‚Äôt always be bringing someone else along. I don‚Äôt want him to spend time with me out of obligation.

I also feel guilty for even having these feelings, because my in-laws are genuinely so nice to me. I‚Äôm constantly reminded that many women struggle with difficult or toxic in-laws, and I know I‚Äôm lucky to have ended up in such a good place. That makes me feel selfish for wishing for something different.

How do I (or should I even) bring this up without sounding ungrateful? Am I wrong for wanting just one day where it‚Äôs only us?

1my5rkb,https://www.jacksonville.gov/departments/neighborhoods/animal-care---protective-services.aspx#close,My dog was hit by a car and I discovered this at the shelter,"Hey guys, my beautiful dog of 14 years was tragically killed by a speeding car in Murray Hill. I‚Äôve been mourning him everyday for months now but I‚Äôm not ready to adopt another. I‚Äôm just too hurt.

Yesterday I mustered up the courage to go to the Animal Care Services Dog Shelter in Riverside and almost put my name in to adopt.

However, when the moment came down to it I had a panic attack and couldn‚Äôt do it.

The amazing employee at the shelter told me I could slowly inch my way back into things, no need to rush.

He said you can actually take a dog on a doggy date. So if you come in the morning, you can take the dog out anywhere in JAX and just give one of the dogs a loving break from the shelter! No strings attached. He recommended taking them to a coffee shop or memorial park for a stroll. 

There were about 200 dogs to choose from. So cute, some were large and fluffy, there was a cool looking husky, one was a really funny smiley dog that looked like a beagle and a golden retriever ü§£ it was so fun! You could tell it would be the best friend you‚Äôve always wanted.


I just want to share this information in case you‚Äôre like me‚Ä¶ not ready to adopt but want to spend time with a dog. 

Thanks for listening, I hope this helps!",76,1755966055.0,jacksonville,9,1.0,False
