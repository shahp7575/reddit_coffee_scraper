1jfgn47,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jfgn47/whats_in_a_name/,What’s in a name?,"Hello everyone, new to polyamory and I’m encountering my first bump in the road. My partner (just have the one at the moment, as I said, new to this) was talking to me about a new woman he had been talking to and how they might go on a coffee date soon. The issue I’m having is she has my name. So if my name is Citrine, she’s also named Citrine, and I can’t stand it.


My partner (let’s call him Bismuth) is married and that’s not an issue for me. Nor is when he was seeing another woman who he was dating beforehand. I’m not gonna to completely discredit that my discomfort may have something to do with the Status Quo Effect but my visceral reaction is being against it because **I’m** Citrine. I honestly think if her name was literally anything else I’d be ok.


So does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do to move past this? Is it reasonable of me to ask that he doesn’t address her by name when talking to me? That sounds kinda juvenile to me. The whole thing is actually ridiculous and a dumb thing to bother me but it really does. ",1,1742443964.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

this has helped her learn to observe new things (like kids across the street at recess, other dogs, guy blasting by on e-scooter, pylon [on its side suspicious way unlike civilian pylons]) without freaking tf out like she used to

she would give up central heating for a piece of kibble. she would gladly never see me again for a slice of banana; for the promise of a slice of banana, site unseen. 

but for dead grass mixed with cigarette butts and jackrabbit poo, specifically in front of apartment complexes, she would nuke our house. banana cannot compare

i can see her see the dead grass. i can sense her notice the apartment behind it. she doesn’t pull on leash anymore so i can feel the tilt

then she’s on her back flailing with an insane expression on her face and full tongue out. she’s talking to herself in little growls which i think are the puppy equivalent of speaking in tongues

some background info: 
i let her sniff on walks. we take sitting breaks. i even let her do this icky doggy perfume shimmy thing for a while ok but she does it for 16 hours in dog years

why???

people walk by my puppy performing an exorcism on herself, go on a full coffee date, text their partner they’ve found someone else and want a divorce, call their lawyer, update their will, get a massage - then come back and she’s STILL there on her back, with me next to her like an amateur police negotiator who’s about to do a lot of paperwork

should i let her do this? will she grow out of it? is this normal? i know it probably has to do with scent but like yeah buddy, it’s on you. i think you got it ",1,1742443830.0,puppy101,0,1.0,False
1jfglc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jfglc0/bf_doesnt_help_out_without_being_asked/,Bf doesn’t help out without being asked.,"Hi guys. I’m gonna start with a warning that this may sound kinda harsh. My F20, Bf M20 doesn’t do anything around the apartment unless he’s asked. I’ll be in the kitchen running around trying to make us coffee or something and he doesnt move an inch, the trash is overflowing and he won’t take it out, he won’t let our dog out in the morning unless I ask multiple times if he can do it or if he wants me to (I have class earlier in the day so I have to get ready sooner). Lately I broke my hand and need more help than usual. He still won’t do anything without being asked. On one hand there is a strong possibility he has autism, part of my mom’s job is neurodivergent evaluations/diagnosis. So that could be why he has to be asked. Another thing is he is a total Mamas Boy. She refers to him as the love of her life, does everything for him etc.  when I first broke my hand he went to visit his family which was preplanned. But the day he was supposed to come up he was 3 hours later than expected cause he slept in. He knew I was waiting for him to shower since it’s difficult getting the splint back on alone.  It’s little things like that but it’s constant. It really makes me see how much I have to ask him to do around the place when a good chunk of it is common sense.  I don’t want to be too harsh since there is a very high chance he’s autistic but again there is a chance it’s just mamas boy behavior. Can anyone give some input on if this seems like an autistic trait or if I need to have a talk with him? Thank you guys ",1,1742443783.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

**My husband spent $10,000 on Pokémon slabs without telling me, forgot my birthday, and we are struggling financially. Am I overreacting for wanting a divorce?**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!addictive behavior!<

------------------------

[Original Post (unddit)](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1j6qfd2/my_husband_spent_10000_on_pok%C3%A9mon_slabs_without/): **March 8, 2025**

I just found out that my husband spent $10,000 on Pokémon slabs that he said were for Christmas and my birthday. I’m physically shaking. I had no idea he was spending that much. I assumed maybe $500 to $1,000 at most. When I checked our bank account and credit reports, I was shocked.

11 years together….

I called him, and he admitted to spending $10,000. The worst part is that these were not even cards I wanted or collections I am into. It was a nice thought, but I was not thrilled by them. To top it off, he completely forgot my birthday on the actual day. He did not say anything until halfway through the day, did not get me a card, flowers, coffee, or anything at all. Even when I suggested we celebrate over the weekend, he made no effort.

Financially, we are struggling. Our mortgage is $10,000 this month because of property taxes and home insurance. Our house is on the market, but it is not selling because of the high price tag; it’s already marked at the lowest we can go with no profit. We had just paid off all of his credit cards in December, bringing them down to 9 percent utilization so we could focus on paying off mine. My credit card debt is from necessary home repairs like replacing an electrical panel to prevent a fire and I had been putting groceries on there to protect our cash for mortgage payments, not random purchases.

At this point, I blocked his number and told him I want a divorce. He has always had a problem with saving money, and I feel completely disrespected and steamrolled especially given our financial situation.

Am I overreacting? I just need advice or a gut check because I feel like I have reached my breaking point.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Of course you're not over reacting. He's deceived you on draining your finances at the worst possible time, and then lied and claimed what he bought for himself was actually for your birthday.

Meet with a divorce attorney. Sell the slabs. They're supposed to be a gift to you, so you can do whatever you want with them. Make sure you get him to text you, in writing, that it's a birthday gift. Save that for the attorney.

In future, have your taxes and insurance escrowed. Property taxes and insurance are outrageously expensive, at least here in CA. Having them withdrawn spread out over 12 months is far easier than doing the lump sum when payment is due.

One of the most important values that a couple should share is on finances. Having one spouse spend freely beyond their means, while the other tries to pay down debt and save, dooms most marriages.

Unblock his number, because he might text you something your attorney can use in the divorce.

You two are not suitable for each other for a life together.

> **OOP:** Our mortgage situation is just fucked to much to go into detail but yes. We are aware and trying to make that change. Even said we would rent for two years at a very low rate in our area to make things different for the next house. But there 100% won’t be a next house

**Commenter 2:** I have only one guestion why did you pay for his credit cards first before focusing on your own? He's clearly financially irresponsible. And if I was struggling I would seem all those pokemon stuff first and don't give him all the money.

> **OOP:** His credit was better and easier to bounce his back faster. I trust him like a fucking idiot. I had a higher balance from home repairs and medical expenses.

**Commenter 3:** Sell the cards - stop waffling. Sell all/any cards. Collectibles are for those who can afford it, you two are not ready
>
> **Commenter 4:** Yep. They’re your gift, so you can sell them.
>>  
>> **OOP:** I don’t disagree. We had collected the 2023 S&V as it was our childhood memories. I was definitely okay we it and it was something we did together. This feels like a pure betrayal of trust.
>> 
>> We talked about buying slabs together as they are expensive and we wanted to choose together. We had that conversation multiple times when we talked about collecting
>> 
>> Adding further betrayal to the situation

**Commenter 5:** i wouldn’t call this an overreaction. That was an incredibly selfish, incredibly idiotic thing for him to do

[Update (automod)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1j865h4/comment/mh2h5c4/): **March 10, 2025 (two days later)**

**Editor's note: OOP made a point to state the picture provided is a stock photo of the said material as an example**

[Sample pic of the card](https://imgur.com/a/YS460Zi)

I want to start by apologizing to the community for deleting my original post. I’m sorry my edits and updates didn’t save under the moderator’s post. Seeing people claim it was fake was too much to bear at the time because this situation is very real to me. There was a lot of victim blaming, and that felt unfair. Please remember to be kind to those who post vulnerable experiences while seeking help during dark times.

What is a Pokémon slab? [see the photo above] A ""Pokemon slab"" refers to a plastic case, often called a ""slab"" in the collecting world, that encapsulates a graded Pokemon card, protecting it from damage while also displaying its condition and value, typically provided by a third-party card grading company like PSA, Beckett, or CGC; essentially, it's permanently sealed container that holds a professionally assessed Pokemon card, like an engagement ring appraisal.

Now for the update:

I am safe. I have contacted a lawyer. No matter what happens, I will continue protecting myself and making better decisions going forward. I also took screenshots and went through his phone completely. While we have no children together, we do have a decade and a lot of love for one another.

He was surprisingly open to giving up control and acknowledged his addiction. He admitted he always knew it was “something,” but as each new hobby came along, they became more and more expensive. He was not angry when I confronted him, but he did break down in tears.

We talked, and while I want to keep identifying details private, I can say that he is getting help, and I now have full financial control. He attended a meeting for Shoppers Anonymous, and we believe he has compulsive spending disorder. Thanks to this community, I realized how serious collector addiction can be. I would not have gone to a lawyer or even known where to start if it weren’t for the advice I received here. Reddit is honest and they know what’s up, that’s why I came here for help. Addiction is a long, difficult journey, and I will hold myself accountable to ensure I don’t ignore red flags.

Where we stand now: • He has agreed to all my terms. • I have full financial control. • We will sell the cards • He is working to sell other items from past hobbies. • We will have weekly financial meetings • He will go to individual therapy and meetings. We will go back to marriage counseling

*After reviewing the finances, it was actually $7,000 spent on cards, not $10,000. The other $3,000 were smaller charges like work lunches and Starbucks. That still adds up. We are working on selling the cards.

Other important changes: • He has promised to be a better husband and stop acting like a child. He recognizes his behavior. • He has also acknowledged that his selfishness has affected others areas of our life like in our support system, and he is working to change that. • We both understand that this is a lifelong addiction that will require daily effort. We have to make that choice individually of how we want to proceed.

I know it’s easy to say, “just leave him.” But marriage is not that simple. Sometimes one partner is at 10% while the other is at 90%. Right now, he is at 10%. Two years ago, I was the one at 10%, and he stuck by me. He gave me the chance to change, and I did. Now it is my turn to offer him the same opportunity. I will not give him a second chance beyond this, but I believe everyone deserves at least one.

I’m not sure if I will post another update.

But if you are struggling, know that this community tells it like it is, but it also offers great support and resources. I wish the best for anyone going through hard times. Please remember to be kind to each other.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP explains what the finanical restraining order is all about**

> **OOP:** A financial restraining order is a court directive that prevents parties in a divorce or similar legal process from taking certain actions with their money or assets, like liquidating assets or making unusual expenditures, to ensure a fair division of property.
> 
> Purpose: The primary goal of a financial restraining order is to prevent one party from depleting or hiding assets before a final property division is determined, thus ensuring a fair outcome for both parties.
> 
> You can do this during a separation.
> 
> Unfortunately ultimatums never work. Each party has to make a choice in the matter. Only he can choose the marriage and want to sell the cards. I can’t force him to do anything. He must want to change.

**Commenter 1:** Hey, I'm glad he is ready to make changes and willing to put in the work! If he had just promised to do better, I still would have advised you to divorce, but if he sticks to all the steps you agreed on, I hope it will all work out for you!

> **OOP:** I’m giving him a strict 90 days. I am going to a lawyer.

**Commenter 2:** Have you considered getting marriage counseling together with him?

> **OOP:** Yes, we’ve already agreed to go back!

**Were the slabs gifts?**

> **OOP:** They were all gifts. They are all mine. I have the screenshot to prove this.

**Commenter 3:** I didn't see the original post but appreciate the update. As you said, marriage is a partnership where you see each other through ups and downs and not everything is a ""leave him"" situation. It's good he acknowledged his problem. Honestly, the saddest part of your update is that $3k of the amount spent was on dumb things like Starbucks; at least with the Slabs, you can sell them and hopefully recoup a good portion of your losses. It's a lesson to all of us in how the little things really add up. Good luck, OP!

> **OOP:** I know. That $3,000 actually hit him harder.
> 
> Thanks for your kind words, getting torn apart here. Can’t make people understand my perspective though.
> 
> I’ve left comments for resources as well and I hope those could help someone else.

**Commenter 4:** There’s a difference between gifting something to your partner that’s on their wish list, surprising them with a luxury item and buying a leisure item for yourself without communicating it to your partner. Plus just as an example my husband and I have financial goals and buying luxury or expensive leisure items undisclosed or not discussed just isn’t us right now. Mostly out of respect but also due to our shared goals. But that’s just us.

> **OOP:** Let me put it this way. The real issue wasn’t the spending itself, but that he didn’t come to me about it first. You’re 1,000 and ten percent correct there. He saw it as a gift and didn’t think through the financial aspect.
> 
> This morning, when we talked, I told him that if he had asked for $7,000 for a trip, I would have said yes. If he had asked for $7,000 for Pokémon cards, I would have said to take $1,000 and grab some surprises or new things he thought I would love.
> 
> I love Pokémon. I love playing, watching matches, and being part of the community. I just prefer full collections, which aren’t always feasible. If he had spent $1,000 on a complete 2023 151 S&V Japanese set, ungraded with one version of each card, I would have been over the moon. Instead, he got a mix of things, including first edition base sets and a new collection I didn’t even know about that I now love.
> 
> I told him I would have preferred one or two slabs from each collection, maybe a mix of my favorites like Bulbasaur, Vulpix, or Snorlax, to test the waters before diving into a bunch of new collection so head strong. Now, we have a lot to offload.
> 
> That said, his heart was in the right place, and he genuinely feels aweful for his mistakes. In a way, this was a wake-up call for us both to stop spoiling each other and refocus on our financial goals. You may never understand. That’s okay. I’ve know this man 11 years to know his bullshit from his genuinely good side. He knows how ducked it was to do what he did. He’s 100% here to make it right and he’s doing all the right things.
> 
> It can take up to two years for trust to be built back up and he’s ready to “suck it up” as my therapist says often.
> 
> He also has been kind in giving me the space to share what’s bubbling inside from all of this. He told me to stop sorting the cards when I started to cry and wait for him to come home so he could help and be there for me in the way I needed. I was upset because I did love the one collection and didn’t want to sell it. He said he already was offloading something of his own for $500 from another hobby and he will sell anything of his first to pay off the debt he created before I have to sell any of the cards I want to keep, because they are my gifts, and these are his consequences to bear.

**Is the pictured card the 10k that the husband spent on?**

> **OOP:** That is a stock photo. It was a few different collections, not just one card. Like 100 different cards.

1jfga10,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfga10,I got to attend the soft opening of the Demented Desert & Coffee food truck opening tonight!,"All of the donuts were homemade, same with the pasta salad and coleslaw. I had the twisted brat with the pasta salad. The brat was served in a twisted donut that was cut like a hotdog bun. It was very sweet, not something I could eat all the time but it still was very good!  The dark pics are because most of the icing glows under black lights.  

The owners are very nice and friendly.  I definitely want to try something else from them again!  If you see them at some of the up coming markets, definitely give them a try!!! Or if you see them at Good Day farms…. *wink wink, nod nod*

1jfg8tp,https://v.redd.it/2u6gjyqdorpe1,When trying to outsmart your big sister fails and your big hurt turns on my hose!,"I had no clue about Old English Sheep Dogs until a morning coffee run turning into me rescuing a stray 3 month girl that the owners didn’t want (husband now won’t let me go out for coffee alone anymore 😏).  I figured we survived raising a German shepherd and dachshund so this should be a cake walk compared to my shepherd puppy stage! 

I was wrong! Don’t get me wrong she’s amazing and smart.. she learns fast and complies when she wants. She’s 6 months old and the best addition to the family especially for my shepherd. She loves grabbing rocks to bring inside to help decorate.. she even learned to stash some extra in the couch got later after we remove the ones she brings in. She doesn’t approve of my Tupperware cabinet so she makes sure to open the doors and push them around the house. Her favorite past time is tackling my son, husband, and her sister. She saves her energy during the day so she can have plenty of zombies at 9pm where she makes sure to splash water on the floor and slide everywhere! She keeps us on our toes and I am so in love with this breed! This was my morning today when I found my yard half flooded because of their playtime.. also she’s huge! 56 pounds at 5 months and is almost as tall as my 3 year old shepherd!",3,1742442578.0,OldEnglishSheepdog,0,1.0,False

We had fun, hung out at coffee points, and outside of work too a couple of times. I don't want to admit this, but the times we chatted sort of became the highlights of my day (the place I work at sucks, 12-14 hr work days, and no one is fun).

For the past 2 weeks she's been ignoring me like hell. Our desks are separated by 2 people, and earlier we used to make a lot of eye contact while on our desks, made some jokes about my manager, her manager and so on. But now, it's zero eye contact, zero communication. But she's still really friendly and communicative with everyone else at work.

Asked her last week if something was wrong, she declined.

Should I do something? Or just forget that I was friends with her in the first place and move on? Once again, I'm an extreme introvert, it took me loads of courage to even ask if something was wrong the first time, I'm not even sure how I would handle the conversation again!

Backstory part 2: I decided to go to a Very Gay School. Like, that is the schools reputation in the surrounding county; we have the conservatories and we are Gay Arts. (My godmother had Things to Say about this; but that's another post I've already vented about). Point being - I'd estimate about 60% lgbt+ population school, if not more.

The actual story: 

First years, regardless of what kind, are required to house together on campus for a semester to ""build community."" This is an utterly idiotic rule, but by that point in my life I'd scrounged up enough money for this not to be a dealbreaker, and finessed the hell out of grants/scholarships/etc to make it work. I'm luckily put in a grad-students apartment with a bunch of the other conservatory people so I think Great. Regular college experience version 2 here we go. We get in a groupchat to talk, and it comes up that (surprise surprise) some of them are gay. *Oh no, never would have guessed,* ""what flavor of queer are y'all?"" I ask. 

**Ace**. I have, by sheer coincidence, been put in housing with **Five Out Of Six Housemates** being aces/demisexuals of varying romantic attractions. (and one incredibly hyper-competent femme lesbian, I was not kidding when I said this uni was Very Gay.) We laugh this up, what are the odds and all that. 

(a quick rundown on the housemates: 1 - enby aroace, 2 - gay demi guy, 3 - hyper-competent femme lesbian, 4 - demisexual demigirl, 5 - enby alloace, 6 - \[myself\] femme ace)

We get to the housing. It's... uni housing, nothing to write home about. The heat's shite and there's a wasps nest outside femme-lesbian's window, and we find out she is Very Much Afraid of Wasps Actually. Her girlfriend visits with wasp-spray, and I figure this is the entirety of the relationship drama we will hear for the year, given that everyone except her is ace. We hang *THE* *Biggest Ace Flag In Existence* in our dining area like a war banner, to mark the historic victory over the wasps, and that's it for housing.

Then. Within like two months housemate #1 has found what they label as **""Soulmate Level QPR Material.""** We're like, oh cool ok? No idea what to make of this normally brusque person waxing poetic about ""soulmates"". I reassess my assumptions about a lack of dating drama. Then the soulmate starts coming over and, yeah, they are functionally soulmate material for housemate #1. I have never seen two people communicate in memes for that long, and I have never seen that much falafel be consumed, and they are somehow like one great eldritch being split itself into two pastel-goth conservatory grad students, and we are all very happy about this. No dating drama, just incredibly cuddly qpr established.

Another few months in, nearing midterms of first semester, and **a second qpr has been established** \- although much less dramatically than the first. Housemate #2 and their partner of choice are demis, so are trying the dating thing, but taking it slow. No drama, and the partner is a board game aficionado so now we're having regular group game nights with our three plus-twos. Housemate 4 and I joke about being the only single girls left in the dorm. 

Semester two, the disaster: Housemate 5 attempts to initiate a relationship with Housemate 4. This does not go well. We do not even get to midterms before Housemate 5 has moved out, and is no longer on speaking terms with the rest of the household. I have never seen someone mess up so many relationships so badly in such a short time. However, in the process of moving out they meet Stage Crew Girl, who at the time only offers to help them move out but as far as I know is now in a committed relationship with them. We still don't speak a lot but from what I hear the both of them are good for each other? *More on this relationship later...*

By this point it hasn't even been a year, and not only have most of my housemates found some sort of relationship-somethings, but we've had relationship drama. The thing I thought we might manage to avoid by being housed with 90% aces. *Sigh.* 

The girlfriend of the lesbian Housemate 3 knows someone who's also looking for a new housing group, so we meet up with this person, to see if we can fill our gaping void where Housemate 5 used to be.

This person is: 1) also ace; 2) in my conservatory; 3) just about the most aesthetically pleasing and intellectually brilliant woman in my conservatory full stop, the kind of person who you can't decide if you want to *be them or consume them*, the type that makes a person say ""be still my beating heart""; and 4) **another ace looking for a new housing situation. \*What Are These Odds\***

This person becomes Housemate 7. I remind myself that I am not going to enter a relationship with someone who I am currently sharing a tiny horrible uni apartment with; because that is the relationship drama I hoped to avoid. One does not simply contemplate kissing ones housemate. *This is what went wrong with housemates 4 and 5, get it together Stavi.*

Luckily, this is all the relationship drama year one. Housemates 2, 4, and the lesbian couple have decided to house off campus the second year. Housemate 1, their soulmate, myself, and housemate 7 apply for a four-person apartment because we have the grants, scholarships, and soulmate's disability-assigned priority access going for us to get a good apartment together for cheap

Mid-first-semester of year 2 I meet up with Housemate 4 for tea/coffee. **She's in a qpr** with her music director from her last show (the student, not the 90 year old professor). *Since when?* Since now apparently, and they are disgustingly saccharine together, and he is incredibly kind to her, and the emotional connection is something else to see. They're doing the next production of midsummer night's dream together, and even though 4 is housing with a friend she's practically living in the theater with music director dude. Housemate 4 asks if I still have feelings for Housemate 7. I deny any and all accusations of squishes with the sputtering fervor of someone who clearly believes denial is a river in Egypt. 

Right before winter break, **we learn that housemate 5 has entered a four-person queerplatonic polycule with the stage crew girl who helped them move out.** The four of them are living in one of the polycule's RV. Nobody knows what to make of this situation aside from an awkward attempt at congratulation on the relationship that social nicety requires. All in the know quietly agree that this is entirely too weird for us. I also begin to wonder where the heck all these queerplatonics are coming from, because the ratio of queerplatonic relationships to regular hookups in our social group is frankly astounding. We know more qprs than allos at this point. 

Year 2 part 2. My adjunct advisor has a demi flag in her pen cup. I'm half convinced this is some sort of social experiment. I remain in severely-scholarship-assisted housing, because I am not driving five hours each way to my classes in my uncle's 39 year old car thanks. I still live with housemate 7. Housemate 7 is still unfairly platonically attractive.

Year 2 part 2.5 - Housemate 7 declares she has a squish on me. Denial is no longer just a river in Egypt, and I come to the realization it's a very stupid river. We bake cookies together, and decide to see where things take us.

We're leave uni, a few letters longer. **I am in a qpr.** 

***So to recap:*** We started with five aces. We ended with twelve, all in varying levels of qpr. (and, of course, the hyper-competent lesbians; who remained hyper-competent lesbians.)

***I am half convinced my grad school experience was a magic queerplatonic matchmaking social-experiment.***",1,1742442452.0,asexuality,0,1.0,False

TL/DR: Have a 1987 with only 87k miles (although a bit crusty from new england), parked since 2020, did prep it for storage, but totally stalled on repairs - should i grow a pair drink some coffee and fix it? Mobile mechanic to fix it? How much is it worth? Sell it with all the parts to fix it to someone who promises not to scrap/part it? or some variation. What is best move financially and conserving my time while keeping me from being guilty because I get attached to every w124 I see? Problems: only spots for three cars in current driveway - wife unhappy - concerned about regret letting it go. 

Thank you w124 members for your wisdom in advance and apologies for the life story. In the end I will always be happy because I will never part with my 95 e320 white wagon (freshly repainted), even if mangled in a heap, God forbid, I will use it as a lawn decoration to be handed down. I also promise to participate more - havent been on reddit or any socials really at all in years. 

Looking for some advice. w124 fanatic, from the moment i saw one as a young boy. I have a 1987 w124 that was dropped in my lap in 2016. My retired neighbor used to flip cars as a hobby(seems like a lifetime ago this was a fun activity) and at the time I had 3 others in my driveway (95 wagon is only one left), and a friend of his died (one owner car, his retirement car) and he was selling it, he couldn't get 2000 for a 1987 with 87000 miles on it. Paid him 1600 with the intention of going through it like my others but never happened. 

**Bad:**

\- valve seals got so bad it wasn't driveable 

\- harmonic balancer turned to dust. 

\- Has an immobilizer on the head rest drop button - no idea how they wired this and chasing it down might be a pain.

\- radio and antenna drains battery occasionally - chased it with diagram to antenna and stopped it with a paper clip, but needs a real fix.

\- neighbor who sold it to me tried to fix the seat switch on passenger side - these do not appear to be available - switch is in pieces in a bag with dozens of little balls !!!

\- ac swapped to r134 - works but very much unsatisfactory. 

\- not my favorite color or interior color (magenta-ish and tan) I do appreciate it but i just prefer white and black on benzes. 

**Good**

\- paint good after some love like most 80s Benz

\- everything works - was best one I had at the time in this regard, since corrected everything on my 95

\- rust contained to jack point on passenger side - crusty underneath but nothing serious.

\- low miles - although mileage is a number for these babies. 

\- interior mint - grandpa car

\- new hood pad, corner markers, light covers (well new in 2017-2018) 

\- properly diagnosed by me - all parts for replacement ready to go (except getting it started again with old gas remnants). 

Anyway, life happened and real job, three kids a pandemic and mortgage later I held on to this one and my 95 wagon knowing the wife would never indulge more cars hah. Its a time for choosing - I absolutely do not have enough time for this old girl, and only three driveway spaces yet I feel obligated to bring her back. Before parking it for good in 2020 in the garage I ran it disconnected fuel lines to tank and jacked it up high and drained it out the front of the tank. I just do not have time to mess around with it - i know what it takes and I cannot bring myself to do it. 

I feel like a spoiled brat getting worked up about a car I have $4000 into total, but I have strong feelings towards it and want to make a good move. I dunno, what would you do? What would you charge for it with the top of engine and belt off? What is it worth? Marketplace is all over the place some are high, some are low, seems like in mint condition this would be 5k, current condition - scrap price. Thanks all if you made it this far. 

Pic from when she was on the road - lost my cheap hungarian replacement side marker - since corrected.

Along with potential creeps 😬.

Just chatting is fine for now, if we stop talking after a while then we just didn’t click and that’s ok. I will say I prefer some women to chat with just because men usually have some other motive which gets sooooo exhausting but all are welcome to send me a message. I’d like to switch to discord vc if we click, maybe play some games or watch each other play games and chat, etc. Some basic info about me:

Only looking for platonic friendships or even just chatting. I love to laugh and often say “lol” after everything. Like to banter but not a requirement. I can be nihilistic and misanthropic. Married, we have two dogs. 420 friendly (daily, mostly all day vaper). I like video games (mainly jrpgs, RPGs, indie stuff like hades, balatro, slay the spire, etc). I’m an introvert and a homebody. Love walking and being in nature but don’t really like where I live currently so I haven’t done that as much. I’d probably go out a bit more if I had someone to do things with. I like horror, coffee, other cultures, and other things. One weird/niche category, my favorite streamer is Kyle Bosman!
Send me a message if any of this sounds interesting. I don’t like listing too much, most of the luck I’ve had on here so far has just been casual/basic back and forth where we’re learning about each other as we talk about our day/lives. If you’re racist, sexist, homophobic, whatever, any kind of hate then we won’t get along well.

With that being said, I don’t like when people message me with “hey” or a basic intro (like your name, age, and martial status). Put some thought in, otherwise I’m gonna see that as a red flag that I’ll constantly have to do the heavy lifting. I’m making a post outlying things about myself, ask a question or give me something to ask you about or comment on besides if you have kids or if you’re married.",1,1742442421.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

Canned Coffee during the Snake fight no longer seems to stack. Before I could do the entire fight on 10 coffee, now I can only do until I get charged and then coffee is gone.

Vats targeting. I can be looking right at an enemy and it's like nope. You don't get to target that. 

Stimpacks are way too slow. For reference, I use field surgeon and first aid both for the Snake and Bot fights. Before I could spam stims and it was no issue. Now I can spam stims and I just about die before any healing happens at all.

I didn't start talking until age 4, I wore diapers in preschool (due to an infection) and I didn't want to go back to big kid underwear. My playmates were always 3-4 years younger. 
I played with toys until age 15 (when I moved onto video games), I skipped prom and hated parties because I thought drinking and dancing all night was boring. My first kiss was forced at 18 (I thought it was gross), then another boy kissed me at age 24 and the sensation still felt gross. I didn't do sleepovers until graduating highschool. I never wanted a tattoo or piercing. I drank my first alcohol and was pressured to try vaping at 25. Didn't like neither. I've gone to like.. 1 nightclub. 

 I didn't start liking coffee until I was 27. Now I can't function in the morning without it. 
I've never fantasized about getting married or doing adult things..until recently.

 I'm currently a virgin at 29 (F) and for the first time in my life, I want to get real piercings (i started wearing a fake one this year), I suddenly want a boyfriend, I got curious about drugs in my mid-20s but never tried any. 2 months ago I bought a pack of edibles. I've never been to a concert before, now I'm going to my first one in a few days. I used to be afraid of moving out and leaving my parents (granted I always paid half the bills), now I can't wait to get out of my mom's lease and live on my own.

 So many suddenlys in my late 20s. I used to think I'd never want a permanent tattoo, but now I'm having second thoughts. It's like, the insular things I used to enjoy as a teen and early-mid 20s don't feel like enough anymore. I was never able to relate to kids my age (at 19 I felt like I was mentally still 12), but now I find myself relating to all these 19 year olds today, which I find pretty sad.

-I love cats. I don’t have one currently, but they are a huge part of my life. In my free time I enjoy visiting cat cafes and meeting all the kitties there. 

-I love to travel. Seeing and experiencing new places (cities, nature, etc.) brings me joy, and I especially love road trips. Would love to travel abroad once I’m in a position to do it financially. 

-My hobbies include swimming, chess, bowling, board/card games, auto racing, watching shows/YouTube, random memes, taking walks, coffee, listening to music, etc. 

-I’m a homebody - I’ll take a cozy, relaxing night playing a game, watching a show and snuggling over a loud party 100 times out of 100. 

-Graduated college. Currently working part-time but hope to make it full-time in the near future. 

-I’m on the autism spectrum and I have an anxiety disorder. If you are extroverted, there will be times where I’ll need my introverted me time. Might seem rigid/nervous at first, but I become my full self once I grow and relaxed and comfortable with another person. 

-Not the best texter when first meeting someone bc anxiety. When getting to know someone new, I prefer to have long talks over the phone. 


-Not religious. Prefer someone secular, but I don’t mind someone religious as long as I don’t get dragged into church/worship. 

-5’10. Would prefer someone 5’7 or below. Open to anyone as long as there’s a connection! 

-Don’t like flirting or playing dating games. I want to be on the same page as my partner and know what they’re thinking. Let’s be blunt, let’s be honest with each other about what we want to see if we’re a fit. 


A few dealbreakers: 

-Must live in the US or Canada. Highly prefer in-person and someone that lives in the Carolinas, but I’m willing to try long distance if there is a connection.

-No MAGA

-No smoking or illicit drugs. 

-No polygamy or open relationships. 

-No party animals. 

Reach out if you are interested or think there might be a connection. Excited to get to know y’all :)

## Understanding the Importance of the Right Chemex Filter

Before diving into specific brands and types,let's understand​ why selecting the right Chemex filter is so crucial. The Chemex brewing system relies on a thick,uniquely designed filter to extract coffee with exceptional clarity and minimal sediment. The‌ Chemex filter​ paper is deliberately thicker than ​standard coffee ⁣filters, allowing it to trap oils, fats, and fine particles ⁣that‌ can contribute to bitterness and acidity.‍ this results in a cleaner, brighter, and more nuanced cup of ⁤coffee that highlights ⁢the⁣ subtle flavors of your chosen beans. Using the wrong filter‌ can ⁤compromise the entire Chemex experience, leading to⁣ a muddy, bitter brew that‌ falls far‍ short of the potential.

For coffee ⁢enthusiasts, the investment in quality Chemex filters is a ⁢worthwhile one. They understand ​that to truly savor the intricate flavors of specialty coffees, a superior filtration system​ is essential.It is the cornerstone for⁤ achieving the 'clean cup' Chemex⁢ is known for.

## Navigating the⁤ World‌ of⁢ Chemex‌ Filters:‌ Types‌ and Features

The Chemex brand⁤ itself⁢ offers⁤ a variety of filters, each with ‌its own characteristics. Understanding these differences is essential for making an informed purchase.

### Chemex Filters Paper: The Gold Standard

The‍ standard *chemex filters paper* are the most popular choice and are available in both square and circular ​shapes. These filters are bonded, meaning they're folded using‍ a unique​ process that creates a consistent and reliable filtration​ surface.

*   **Square vs. Circle:** The shape you choose often comes down to personal preference. Square filters are ‌generally considered easier to fold and fit snugly into the Chemex brewer, ⁣while circular filters are pre-folded ⁤and offer added convenience.The⁣ *chemex filter square vs circle* debate ultimately revolves around ease of use ‌and perceived flow rate differences, with some users believing squares provide a slightly slower, more thorough extraction.

*   **Bleached vs. Unbleached:** Another key consideration is the bleaching process. *Chemex⁢ filters bleached* are treated with oxygen to whiten the paper, while⁤ *chemex filters unbleached* ‌retain their natural brown color. some people ⁣are ​concerned about potential chemical ‍residues from ​bleached filters affecting the ‍taste ⁤of their ⁤coffee, while others prefer the clean ‌aesthetic of ⁤white​ filters. Unbleached filters,⁣ on the other hand, might impart a slightly papery taste, especially if not rinsed thoroughly⁤ before brewing. Ultimately, the choice depends on your individual preferences and concerns.
*   **Pre-folded ‍Filters:** ⁢*chemex pre folded filters* offer ⁢a important advantage‍ in terms of convenience. ⁤They eliminate the⁤ need for manual folding, saving time and ensuring a ‌consistent fit every time.

### Finding your CHEMEX ⁣FP-1 filters ⁤or⁢ other Sizes
Finding the right size ​filter is an important step. Check the model of your chemex to find the perfect filter. ‍if you have a smaller​ Chemex, then you likely will ⁤need the⁢ *chemex ⁣fp 1 filters*.[[Explore Top Rated chemex filter on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=chemex filter)

Cleaning is also more involved, requiring thorough rinsing and occasional deep ⁣cleaning to prevent the buildup of oils and residue.

Many eco-conscious pour-over ⁢enthusiasts actively search for *eco chemex filters*. They want to ‌drink great coffee without​ adding to environmental issues!

Vi um vídeo no tiktok que era a intro em piano de I NEED U, e tava escrito algo como ""juventude que não volta mais"". E desde então estou com ansiedade só pensando nesses tempos que não voltam mais, a época de 2015-2018 em que eu praticamente não tinha obrigações. Tudo que eu fazia era jogar e ver MVs, conseguia acompanhar os programas de variedades e as teorias dos MVs.

A nostalgia das músicas antigas como LIKE, COFFEE, RUN, I NEED U, SAVE ME, ETC. ME DÃO UMA ANGÚSTIA DE QUERER VOLTAR NO TEMPO. Enfim, entrei no reddit para procurar uma comunidade só pra poder externar esse sentimento.

We are on the Wonder right now. 3/17 sailing out of San Diego. I just have to say I’m really disappointed in the quality of service on the ship. This is our second cruise with DCL (first being the Dream 12/2023, which was AMAZING). With the exception of a few absolutely standout staff members, nobody on the ship seems to know what is going on? It’s not a big ship and staff have to keep pulling out maps if we ask them where something is, guest services sent us to Pinocchio’s for dinner and it was closed (like VERY closed and not opening for another 5 hours), many of the servers are inattentive (coffee with no creamer but nobody will come by for us to ask for creamer, waffles supposed to come with whipped cream and came with nothing, totally forgetting a meal for our kid). We were told in advance by DCL they would be bringing kids to the Oceaneer’s club during dinner and that never happened - wait staff said they saw some kids picked up but no idea how to do it. We sit down in the pub or a bar and nobody comes to take our order (not a one off, this seems to be the norm?). Few of the tables in the bars are getting cleaned off either. We didn’t get anything in our rooms for pirate night - housekeeping staff said they didn’t have anything to give out.

Like what is going on?! It feels like many of the staff on the ship (save for a handful of standouts) are under trained or the ship is severely understaffed.

I think this is going to be the last cruise we take with DCL for a long time unfortunately. ",2,1742441687.0,dcl,1,0.67,False

I used the coffee table to brace myself and almost broke it or it just sounded bad/was loud. Was limping afterwards since it hurt. Today, my ankle is little bit sore, but I could run on it and have it not bother me right now. That being said my wife first reaction, “watch out for the coffee table?!?!” Which made me mad and frustrated that it felt she cared more about her coffee table than her husband’s ankle and well being. She thinks I should be tough. We got into a pretty good argument tonight about it. When I get frustrated, I can get teary-eyed and pretty emotional since I never learned how to express my frustration in a proper way. to give you context, I am a recovering alcoholic and I have ADHD.  Everything was fine until she is the one that brought up the situation last night. Then it set me off on how I am frustrated that I feel she has a lack of empathy for me in this situation, even though it is not that big of a deal probably. I expect her first reaction to be “Are you OK?”, instead of “watch out for the coffee table?”

TLDR:  I injured my ankle yesterday and used my wife’s coffee table that she loves and used it to brace myself and she said, “Watch out for the coffee table?!?!” I have been very emotional and frustrated about her reaction even though I am fine now. ",1,1742441551.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I’m not really a morning person so instead of making breakfast I just have a cup of coffee, I’ve been adding a cup of fair life milk to my coffee which gives me an extra 13g protein in the morning and my guilty pleasure atm is having my morning coffee with these sugar free shortbread cookies I found at Walmart. That usually holds me off for a few hours until breakfast which usually consists of some type of carb (whole wheat bread, bagels) protein (eggs, bacon, breakfast sausage), fat (butter, olive oil) and some type of veggie or fruit. 

I haven’t really been that big of a snacker lately but if I do snack I might have string cheese (high protein), also love snacking on pickles (please dont judge 🙏), lemons (helps the sweet and sour craving), or just tea. 

I’m also not a big lunch person, on the rare chance I do have lunch I’ll probably just have some soup or a sandwich

For dinner I usually have something high protein meal prepped to eat after I come home for the gym and for dessert I have sugar free ice cream w/ Oreos 

I know it’s not perfect but it works for me and I somehow average around 80-101g protein and 19-25g fiber",2,1742441255.0,PetiteFitness,2,0.75,False

Hey reddit fam! 👋  

I’ve been testing out **Idle-Empire** for the past month, and honestly? It’s become my go-to for earning a little extra cash while barely lifting a finger. I’m averaging **$5-$10 daily** just by letting it run in the background or spending a few minutes here and there. Let me break it down for you!  

### **What Is Idle-Empire?**  
It’s a legit rewards platform where you earn points by:  
- 🎮 **Playing mobile games** (yes, actual fun ones!)  
- 📝 Completing surveys and offers  
- 📺 Watching ads or videos  
- 💰 Even *mining crypto* passively (optional)  

Points convert to **PayPal cash, Amazon gift cards, Bitcoin**, and more. Payouts start as low as $0.50, so you’re not waiting forever to cash out.  

### **Why I’m Hooked**

- **Daily login bonuses** – free points just for opening the app.  

### **How I Earn $5-$10 Daily**  
I combine a few methods:  
1. **Complete 2-3 surveys** during coffee breaks (≈20 mins).  
2. Let the **crypto miner** run overnight (earns ≈$2-3/day alone).  
3. Grab quick points from **daily rewards** and mini-tasks.  

It’s not a “get rich” app, but it’s perfect for consistent side cash. 💸  

### **Join Using My Referral Link & We Both Win!**

1jfftv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1jfftv3/are_they_just_being_polite/,Are they just being polite?,"Sometimes I wonder if there’s something I’m giving off that I can’t pick up on, and I’m trying to place what it might be.

I moved to a new city about a year ago, and I’ve noticed a lot of people I meet are very friendly and nice, and we meet up for coffee and have good chats. However, all of them then seem to put it on me to keep things going, which has never really been my experience before.

Usually as we get ready to say goodbye, they’ll say ‘this has been so nice please reach out to do this again’ or something along those lines. Then today I ran into another person who I’ve known for a bit who I chatted with briefly and he said ‘let me know if there’s ever anything you’d like to do.’ I mean, all very polite, but…is this essentially them saying they’re only interested in friendship if I maintain it?

I only ask because generally speaking, all my prior connections and friendships have been two-way streets. I find in this new place that the interaction above just seems to keep happening, and I can’t quite figure out why. People seem to like chatting with me and want to know what’s going on in my life, and I them…yet they make no efforts to include me or think of me on their end. They’re always happy to meet when I suggest it or I invite them to something, but they never seem to consider reaching out to me on their own.

I’m sort of tired of having to always be the initiator. I don’t mind it, but when it’s all the time, well…I wonder if these people actually do in fact like me or are just being polite. But then, why meet up? Surely they’d just find an excuse to say they’re busy or cut these meet-ups short?

It’s just a bit frustrating, and since it’s everyone, hard not to wonder if I’m doing something off-putting. Or maybe I’m just hyper aware of it because I’m in this new place. But again, I previously came from a place where people never said things like that, and I generally always knew where I stood. Just sort of picks at me how so many people seem to subconsciously think I have the time to do the labour of always planning and maintaining things. Not sure if that means I should drop them and look for other people who make an effort. ",2,1742441140.0,socialskills,3,1.0,False

Please remove if not okay. 

I do not have a POTS diagnosis currently.

I am a nurse and I previously worked in the electrophysiology department in a cardiology clinic. I had patients who had POTS and dysautonomia. 

In November I picked up my baby, felt extremely hot (the unusual sign I had before I had a syncopal event) and my watch said my HR was 154. The high HR, dizziness, and waves of heat have continued and I have been tracking symptoms and HR.

I just got to see a cardiologist at the same place I used to work. Since January, I have been supplementing with salt pills and powders daily. I also have had almost no hot caffienated beverages and the combination of these has been helping a lot. I still have symptoms, but most days, my HR is manageable. 

We did orthostatics in the office and my HR did shoot up both to sitting and to standing, but the doctor said since it wasn't sustained, I don't meet criteria.

My understanding is that there is no concensus on what ""sustained"" means. Additionally, I believe if I did not take my salt supplements or had my previous typical hot coffee, I would show different signs and symptoms. I tried to convey this by telling her what has been helping me, but I guess it didn't mean anything to her.

We also decided against TTT. She said treatment would be the same with or without TTT, which I am absolutely fine to avoid right now. She did give me recommendations for more salt, pilates, and compression socks.

Lastly, I thought autonomic dysfunction/dysautonomia were umbrella terms if you don't meet POTS criteria, but I don't think she indicated this. 

So, my questions are 1) do you have any other information on HR being sustained, 2) do you think my HR would be different if I wasn't treating my symptoms and if so, how can I express that to my provider without feeling like crap while doing testing, 3) is autonomic dysfunction/dysautonomia an umbrella term?

Spending most of my adult life and five years of my childhood in FL taught me to look for plums (Eglin AFB) and oranges (Tampa). Outside of acorns and finding blackberries in the wild (Eglin), I'm pretty much lost.

I think that's why I like the semi-grid.

Close enough to civilization to not die. Even better a small patch of trees right in the middle of the grid and I'm fine.

I stopped by my new favorite dumpster this morning and snagged a pear, another raw potatoes, two tangerines and an apple. I ate a couple of strawberries while I gathered my treasure.

Around 2 pm my stomach started growling. I had a couple of options. Panhandle at McDonald's or do a bit of urban foraging.

Before I went on my expedition I stopped by old faithful. Yesterday's fruit was already turning. Grabbed some asparagus and went on my way.

Although I was extremely hungry, I was probably getting more nutrients these last two days than I had the entire time I was in Texas. I ate good in TX. But fruit and veggies were sparse.

....

I found an Asian market that must sell soups and dinners. Ate about two handfuls of noodles (tasty), but started to smell something. It wasn't the noodles, but something awful was in the air.

Headed down the road and saw a gas station. Inside the organic, residential type can was a ton of hot dogs and other gas station food. Intermixed with coffee grounds. Tried a bite of the hot dog. It just didn't taste good enough to warrant the risk. I literally couldn't tell how long that stuff was there.

Kept trekking.

I found a Mexican restaurant and ate about four of the smallest bananas I've ever seen. Someone in the comments will hip me to what I actually ate. I'm sure it has a name besides tiny bananas. Grabbed three small cucumbers and was feeling good about the hunt.

I'm not sure how far I had walked, but the complexion of the businesses change.

Not that way.

I mean no restaurants, grocery stores or other places that sold food.

I finally see a gas station.

I was caught immediately.

My hand wasn't in the cookie jar. My grasp was around a sandwich still in the original container.

""I'm hungry.""

That was my only response to his three objections.

""I'm hungry.""

""Please sir. I'm hungry.""

....

I had no intention of arguing. I just wasn't letting go of that sandwich or that bag I had resting on the lip of the 8 yd dumpster.

....

It finally sunk in. The store owner told me that the sandwiches were expired. I assured him I wouldn't sue him.

""I'm just hungry.""

I was.

He let me know that I need to ask in the future. I said I would. I meant it.

I only took three sandwiches but he was more than happy to let me know there were quite a few more.

We all speak the same language.

On a base level.

I ate the tuna fish sandwich on whole grain bread first.

Solid choice.

That was my biggest risk. When mayo turns it can get ugly.

Next on the menu was turkey and pesto.

Another solid choice.

I will have to look up pesto later. Is that cheese or the green stuff on the bread?

Doesn't matter.

Lastly I was eating the ham and cheddar.

Originally, I thought that would be the safe bet. Italian style bread. Ham. Cheddar.

It should have been called ham and cheese whiz.

I'm already grossing myself out eating cheese whiz. Not that hungry anymore.

Next thing I know I'm thinking about the hot dog in coffee grounds.

I started dry heaving.

Immediately threw the rest of that sandwich in a trash receptacle and dry heaved about four more times.

In my head.

Fuck.

These idiots know Reddit will blame the raw potatoes.

I wasn't exactly sure if I was sick or not.

Nope.

I've got a weak stomach.

I know.

A dumpster diving bum with a weak stomach?

Yep.

I'm back at the library now using their internet.

Since I didn't actually vomit, I'll chalk up today to having a weak stomach and thinking about something I shouldn't have been thinking about.",7,1742439888.0,vagabond,6,0.77,False

1jfff1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/1jfff1b/please_sanity_check_my_water_softener/,Please Sanity Check My Water Softener Installation Plan (and a few questions),"Thanks for reading.

**Background**  
City Water  
Hardness - 11/12GPG   
Use about 3500 gallons per month  
On city water

Not a plumber, but cheap IT professional who knows enough to be dangerous. I fixed my slab leak myself as well as some other minor plumbing repairs in the past. I'm looking at installing my own softener and whole home filter. I've done a fair bit of research and effectively I've drawn my plan above.

I'm looking at using an Aquasure water softener and filter - mostly because it seems to be relatively available.

I have a couple primary questions about my setup 'plan'

1. The 'P's are pressure gauges, do I have too many? 
2. If I don't have a pressure problem now, should I still strongly consider a PRV? Why?
3. I have a Spin Down Filter mostly to protect against some failure of the system that might result in resin going into the house, necessary? 
   1. Should I plumb it to the drain with the pressure relief from the hot water heater and the drain from the softener?
4. V's are ball valves that allow for maintenance - is this the best type of valve to use here?
5. I read [this guide](https://www.aquatell.ca/pages/ultimate-water-softener-guide) from Aquatell - they speak about Softener Efficiancy Rating - is that bogus? It seems no other vendors have this rating unless I'm blind. Everyone is using the big 32000 grain or 48000 grain number. I care deeply about the efficiency of the softener and don't want an inefficient system. It seems California law requires that the efficiency meets a certain standard - now I'm not in California I'm in the Southeast - but I assume that that means anything that I buy is probably at least rated for California's efficiency standards? I don't mind a more expensive system to ensure I have the right equipment. I consider myself to be in my forever home and would like the system to work well but also be serviceable, by me.

1jffejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jffejh/what_can_i_do_to_learn_how_to_communicate_more/,What can I do to learn how to communicate more effectively with people when you might have ASD as an adult until I can get connected with a therapist again?,"I’m admittedly not great at communicating with others at all based on losing the last friendship I had earlier this evening, so I apologize in advance if I say anything weird or offensive at all. 

Basically, I have some kind of bipolar disorder that doesn’t respond to any of the 40+ psych meds I’ve tried that my Insurnace covers, a few severe trauma disorders, and possibly some of form of neurodivergence. ASD, ADHD, and developmental delays in emotional maturity are very prevalent with the men in my family especially (I’m an intersex male). A lot of the issues I have with socializing in particular (being unable to read sarcasm at all, not understanding when to say “Thank you” vs “You’re welcome”, not knowing how to communicate information about myself without getting lost in the technical details, feeling like I’m a 14 year old emotionally trapped in a 22 year old body) are the same issues the men in my family had who were diagnosed with ASD, ADHD, or developmental delays. It truly could be from my trauma disorders or whatever version of bipolar I have (especially since due to my trauma, the first friend I ever had was at the age of 12), but the extent of the dysfunction it causes in my ability to even communicate the most basic of information in all conversations and the fact all of the men in my family had the same issues tells me it might possibly be related to ASD or another neurodivergent disorder. 

It’s been very difficult for me to find a therapist for the last 2 years. Part of it is I’m barely stable enough to stay out of a psych hospital at this point, but part of it is I can’t even figure out how to talk to a therapist properly without them getting too freaked out about the fact I have 6 diagnosed mental illnesses that I’m aware of (none of them even being the neurodivergent disorders I possibly have and it’s possible I might have 2 more mental illnesses I was never able to get diagnosed along the way). My Insurnace doesn’t cover residential treatment (which all of my former psychiatrists have recommend for me), I’m completely estranged from my family so I don’t have that support, I just lost the last friend I had because I said something that is not socially appropriate that I didn’t even recognize was socially inappropriate until he pointed it out because I objectively know I can’t read social cues for shit, and if I miss anymore work, I’m financially fucked. The cards are stacked against me, but my experience with my friend made me reach out and try the process of finding a therapist again. I found someone local on a Psychology Today page who specializes in bipolar and trauma disorders. As best as I could in a 2 minute voicemail, I requested a consultation to help find a therapist who can help me and was as open as I could be about why finding a therapist has been basically impossible. I explained that I want to make the main focus of therapy to be learning how to effectively communicate with others and left it at that. Part of my social issues is I can’t read when to shut up and it overwhelms a lot of people, so I apologize if I’m even overwhelming you with this information I’m throwing into this post. 

Point is, I objectively know I’m doing what I need to do to start improving on this. However, it’s gonna take me at least a few months to find a therapist who find be a good fit and I have to start working on this now. Not because I’m trying to be like an unreasonable toddler about it, but objectively, I can’t even have a conversation with the person bagging my groceries at the grocery store without making them uncomfortable because my social skills are that bad. Me being almost completely socially isolated because of these issues isn’t helping it or my severe depressive episode either. The biggest place I need to start working on it is how to communicate appropriately at my food-service job at my university. Since I don’t have any friends anymore, it’s the last place I ever socialize in anymore and I’ve made an absolute mess for myself there with not my boss (because she’s extremely understanding of the fact that I work as hard as I can despite my mental illnesses), but my coworkers. 

So, do you guys have any resources on how I can start learning how to communicate more effectively now? I know there’s nothing objectively wrong with the way I logically process the world in my head and I don’t want to change that, but whatever the cause of it is, I think differently than a lot of, what I would assume to be neurotypical people, do. Because of that, I just need to learn how to talk to them in a way they understand and that’s ok! A therapist will be the best person to guide me on how to do that, but given it’ll take a few months to get that therapist, I want to know what I can do now for this. One suggestion on Google said is to sit and observe how people socialize naturally in the world. Where would I even go to do something like that? I don’t have any friends or family, so I need to go somewhere to observe and collect data. Would like a Starbucks be a good start? I’m not a man who has many financially resources, so the less expensive/free that place is so I can sit and learn, the better. Fortunately, while I don’t take classes in person, I live in the dorms at my university. Ironically, I’m a psychology major! Would I be able to find something on campus where I can just sit and observe social interactions? And, how do I not make it obvious I’m observing people in places where it’s not appropriate to share that I’m doing that (like a coffee shop) since if someone did that to me at least, it’d make me uncomfortable. The only thing that really guides me the best with my poor ability to socialize is my empathy, so I try to use it when I can. 

Otherwise, if you know of any websites or resources that can help give me a start, I’d really appreciate it! Are you supposed to express intense excitement in a statement like that through the use of an exclamation point? Or was that even a little too much to be socially appropriate? This is what I mean, I can’t figure out even the basics of this stuff. Additionally, is there anyone my PCP could recommend as a medical specialist who could help me with this stuff? That’s another resource I can utilize to help me with this. 

Thank you for reading this thus far. I don’t entirely understand how, but I know people get overwhelmed when I’m trying to ask for help like this and I might’ve overwhelmed you. So, I apologize if I did and thank you for reading thus far. I know things are very difficult right now (sorry, I started crying writing this last paragraph and I know my ability to read social cues goes down even more when I’m emotionally overwhelmed so please be patient with me). And I know getting the help I need has been next to impossible because I truly have a lot of things working against me in terms of lack of resources. But, the reason why my depression, though severe, isn’t causing thoughts of not wanting to be here is I objectively know it will get better if I start working on this now. Can’t give up hope when you know it can get better (though that can be very difficult to attain), right? 

Thank you! I don’t know the right way to communicate a goodbye in this context, so I’m just gonna say goodbye! ",2,1742439760.0,autism,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jffcf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpalsover30/comments/1jffcf1/34m_usa_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,"34M, USA - Longing for intense and deep connection and elaborate exchange","Salutations!

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and the occasional postcard, and I'd like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to also give that to someone else as well.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal* \- cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. 

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and the occasional postcard, and I'd like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to also give that to someone else as well.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal* \- cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. 

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details.

I don’t drink, smoke, vape. I mostly drink water, sometimes drink lemonade/crangrape juice, rarely drink coffee, never drink soda. My main problems are sugary foods and lack of motivation to take care of my teeth.

I’ll admit, I’ve had an overall hygiene problem for a few years now, I rarely feel like caring for myself at all, because it feels like such a chore, it’s annoying, I could be doing anything else, don’t feel good afterwards, yada yada. I brush my teeth a few times a month, not nearly as often as I should, though I’ve been trying to do better more recently, brushing when I notice plaque and using mouthwash. I have what I believe is some demineralization by my gums/base of my teeth, but otherwise my teeth seem fine, with no pain, discoloration besides faint yellow, no holes, no sensitivity to hot, cold, sour, or sweet foods that last longer than a mere few seconds, and no pain when biting/putting pressure down.

I’ve never been questioned or had bad breath pointed out, but I have my first dentist appointment in maybe three years tomorrow, and I’m concerned about it. You know when people breathe on their hands when they’re cold? I do that, but with my mouth closed, and in the very back of my throat, I taste *something,* but I don’t know what. It just tastes kind of musky, not rancid, but I’m afraid I’ve grown so used to this taste that I don’t realize it is actually very bad. I just know I taste something, and I feel like I shouldn’t.

However, I (30f) met this guy on dating app (30 m), we really hit it off. We are both moving to the same place in 4 months but live super far away from each other until then. We have been video calling for like an hour a night, voice notes etc and it's honestly been lovely. 

He passed a comment today about how he likes being single and not looking for a relationship, so I told him that obviously it's very early days, and not necessarily with him because we don't know each other that well but I actually am looking for a relationship eventually so let's cut the flirting and go back to being friends and we can still meet for a coffee when we move. 

He immediately backtracked and said he is looking for one, used the words in the future like 10 times in under two minutes and kept saying if we worked out he would like to be in a relationship in the next 1-2 years. 

My gut is telling me that he's not being legit and most importantly, needing 2 years to get into a relationship with me is crazy to me personally. But on the other side, if it's 4 months until we're in the same place anyway, it would prob take me 2-3 before I'm comfortable to be in a relationship with him anyway...

I have OCD in impurity. I have fears of filthy things such as feces and urine.  
Today, a situation has happened to me which is making anxious and overthinking.

I went to a small computer store to replace my power supply unit for my PC. the employer inspected my pc, then he dusted it with air compressor because it had a lot of dust. 

my problem here is that he put the pc in the floor (Both vertically and horizontally) while he has dusting it off. I am having doubts and fears whether the floor is clean or not. The floor was dry and had some spots that look like coffee spots and dust spots. the floor looks clean enough but im heaving fears of its cleanliness, especially the fact that this floor gets step on by shoes. 

also, I'm having doubts whether the shoes of the employer touched my pc or not while he was dusting it off. probably not, and even if it did, it's most likely the sideways (front.back,left,right) of the shoes that may have touched the PC. most likely not the bottom of the shoes.

  
all that said, I'm debating if I should clean the PC or I should not listen to the OCD.

What I'm asking for you to help me with is, would you worry about this situation? would you even think of it? do you think it was totally normal for the employer to put my pc in the ground?

I’ve been testing out **Idle-Empire** for the past month, and honestly? It’s become my go-to for earning a little extra cash while barely lifting a finger. I’m averaging **$5-$10 daily** just by letting it run in the background or spending a few minutes here and there. Let me break it down for you!  

### **What Is Idle-Empire?**  
It’s a legit rewards platform where you earn points by:  
- 🎮 **Playing mobile games** (yes, actual fun ones!)  
- 📝 Completing surveys and offers  
- 📺 Watching ads or videos  
- 💰 Even *mining crypto* passively (optional)  

Points convert to **PayPal cash, Amazon gift cards, Bitcoin**, and more. Payouts start as low as $0.50, so you’re not waiting forever to cash out.  

### **Why I’m Hooked**  
- **Zero upfront cost** – completely free.  
- **Works globally** (most features available worldwide).  
- **Passive options**: The crypto miner runs quietly, and you earn while sleeping.  
- **Daily login bonuses** – free points just for opening the app.  

### **How I Earn $5-$10 Daily**  
I combine a few methods:  
1. **Complete 2-3 surveys** during coffee breaks (≈20 mins).  
2. Let the **crypto miner** run overnight (earns ≈$2-3/day alone).  
3. Grab quick points from **daily rewards** and mini-tasks.  

It’s not a “get rich” app, but it’s perfect for consistent side cash. 💸  

### **Join Using My Referral Link & We Both Win!**

For all our entries, we had to specify the bite and sweetness of each brew, so we made some note cards for folks to mark down their thoughts on a scale from 1-5. We had some clear favorites, and a mead that got only 1s & 2s in the overall score.

# Hydro Flask Replacement Lid: 2025's BEST Options Compared & Reviewed!

is your trusty Hydro Flask missing a lid? Did it crack after that unexpected tumble down the hiking trail? Or maybe you’re simply looking to upgrade to a more convenient style? You're not alone. A hydro Flask is a important investment, and a lost or broken lid shouldn't render your favourite water bottle useless. Finding the right hydro flask replacement lid can breathe new life into your beloved bottle, and this guide is designed to help you navigate the often-overwhelming world of replacement lids.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the best hydro flask replacement lid options available in 2025, covering everything from different lid types and compatibility to where to find them and how to choose the perfect one for your needs. Whether you're seeking a hydro flask straw lid replacement, a hydro flask flex cap replacement, or simply trying to figure out what hydro flask lid sizes will fit your bottle, we’ve got you covered.## Why replace your Hydro Flask Lid?

Before we dive into the options, let's quickly address *why* a replacement lid is so vital. Beyond the obvious (keeping your beverage contained!), a good lid is crucial for:

   **Maintaining Temperature:** Hydro Flasks are renowned for their insulation. A damaged or incorrect lid can compromise this,leading to lukewarm water or quickly melting ice.
   **Preventing Leaks:** Nobody wants a soggy backpack or a water-logged car seat. A leak-proof hydro flask lid is essential for mess-free hydration on the go.
*   **Hygiene:** A cracked or damaged lid can harbor bacteria and become tough to clean, potentially affecting your health.*   **Convenience:** The right lid can considerably improve your drinking experience, whether it's a straw lid for effortless sipping or a flip lid for quick access.   **Sustainability:** Replacing just the lid is far more enduring than buying a whole new bottle.

These needs are at the core of why people seek out a new lid. From the active hiker to the environmentally conscious commuter, the perfect replacement lid restores functionality and peace of mind.And if your hydro flask lid broke, leaked, or cracked, know that a replacement is a much better option than a full replacement!

## Understanding Your Hydro Flask and Lid Needs

Before shopping for a new hydro flask replacement lid, consider these key factors:

   **Hydro Flask Size:** This is the most crucial factor. Lids aren't universally sized. Are you rocking an 18 oz, 24 oz, 32 oz, or 40 oz Hydro Flask? Knowing your bottle's size ensures a proper fit. You might even need to check your bottles if you own various sizes and accidentally mix-matched lids.
*   **Mouth type:** Hydro Flasks come in two primary mouth types: wide mouth and standard mouth. A hydro flask wide mouth lid will *not fit a standard mouth bottle, and vice versa. Many users actively search for a hydro flask lid replacement wide mouth or hydro flask lid replacement standard mouth to make sure they end up with the right one.
   **Desired Lid Functionality:** What kind of drinking experience are you after? Do you prefer sipping through a straw, chugging from a spout, or taking slow sips from a customary lid? Knowing this will help you narrow down your choices.
   **Materials:** Do you prefer a hydro flask lid stainless steel for durability,or are you okay with a BPA-free hydro flask lid plastic option? Think about your priorities.

these are questions you should answer before going in to buy hydro flask lid!

1jferdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jferdr/same_time_every_year_same_guy/,Same time every year. Same guy.,"Last year, I (19F), went for coffee after college with my friend. As we left the coffee shop to go for a walk we passed the greggs. 
Usually no one sits outside February time but that day there was this guy. Omfg he was so good looking. He had super intense eyes and long dark hair he had up in a man bun. We locked eyes for a second and I looked away.
Usually I’m very confident but I weighed a lot back then due to my depression after basically being held hostage by my ex boyfriend for almost 7months. 
So my self esteem was quite low. However despite putting on weight I never gained weight on my face which was great so I was still gorgeous plus it wasn’t like I was obese. However for me, I felt huge since I had such a tiny frame.

ANYWAYYYY (sorry I got mad autism and I ramble).

I couldn’t pass up on this guy. Everything about him seemed meant for me and the way I felt when we locked eyes was something you only hear about in a book. Everytime I sneaked a peak at me he was still looking at me. As I went round the corner with my friend he looked down at his steak bake and smiled.
Crazy.
After a very girly debrief I sent my friend to go back and ask for his number. Like I said he has VERY intense eyes and she got scared and aborted mission.

DID I MENTION THIS GUY HAS A MOTORCYCLE.
He is like the epitome of cool:

Man bun
Olive skin
Dark hazel eyes
Motorcycle 
Leather jacket

Like I’d have his babies right now. Kidding(ish)

Me and my pal continued wandering round town and I made eye contact with him a few more times but I couldn’t work up the courage to face the possibility of rejection. 
Eventually he met up with his group and he gave one last look as he went up the stairs to the car park I gave him a lil wave and he waved his helmet while turning his back to me.

It should stop there right?

No.

I ran round to the other side of the car park and watched him and his friends stand by their vehicles, probably discussing where they were heading next. He looked to cool with his helmet on, bruh.
My friend told me he was gonna think I was crazy if he spotted me watching but I just wanted to see his face for possibly the last time. + when he did see me he freaking waved!!!!
And then got in his motorcycle and left.

I’m a musician and after that day I composed an entire arrangement for him and posted it.
Every evening at the same time I would go into town in hopes of meeting him again. Yet he was never there.
A few weeks went by and my infatuation never died. One day after a couple solo drinks at spoons I walk past the car park and see him putting on his helmet.

You probably think “this is the part she stops yapping and says she got his number.” 
NO.

I just stood under the entry to the car park and let him mount his bike and drive away, like a fool.

I never saw him again for the rest of the year and thought I scared him off with my stalking. 

But the same time this year , a couple weeks ago I was waiting for the bus to go to college.
I’m stood under the bus shelter checking the times. The rain is heavy and the wind is icey. Suddenly I see a helmet and leather jacket pass me and inside that helmet sat the most intense eyes known to mankind. Two eyes I had thought about daily for the past 365 days. It was motorcycle guy.
I’m still shocked I even saw him and even more shocked that he saw me first. He walked round the corner and I continued waiting for my bus. And when he came back round he saw me again and nodded at me and crossed the road to get on his bike.
I literally forgot to breathe out of shock.
For no reason at all that day I decided to wear this sick ass fit and I KNOW he was impressed. I literally looked like I was made to sit on the back off his bike and ride off into the sunset with him.

I haven’t see him in town since.

(Also don’t know if I mentioned this but it’s a small town and not too many people stand out so I should’ve seen him again by now.)

Last night I went to the 2hollis Glasgow concert. He was there. I think. Dark eyes but the hair was shorter. The only reason I think it was him is because it was the same look. The way only the motorcycle guy has ever looked at me and he looked happy to see me. It was loud and I’m short and lights were flashing and mosh pits were everywhere but somehow he ended up next me holding onto me during the chaos. Next second one of my friends pulled me and I never saw him again through the sea of the endless sweaty shoulders possessed by the twinks of the 2hollis fandom. Man, 2hollis people are so tall.

Anyway guys I feel like I’m limited to  two chances a year with guy as it’s such a crazy coincidence I see the same time every year. Then again it’s only happened twice. We’ll see what happens next year.
I’ve never even heard his voice and yet I miss him forever. Do you think we’re fated or I should probably start going to therapy?

Filming it helped me slow down and pay attention to the little things. Plus, there’s something kinda peaceful about capturing those quiet moments before the day really starts.

Lately, I’ve been sharing these short videos, not because I think I’m some kind of coffee expert (far from it), but more to share the simple joy of the process. There’s something almost meditative about watching the bloom or the steam rising off a fresh cup. If you’re curious, here’s today’s little ritual. No talking, no frills — just coffee.

The year I spent in an LDR last year causes me existential dread and kept me in a loop of a banal existence, but I know this LDR would be handled better and offer more opportunities for visits. I can't decide if ""really great"" is good enough to put myself through another year of waiting, when I've been ""waiting"" for my life to start for the past 3 years of my 20s and I get nauseous even thinking about it. Does it make sense to pursue this relationship?

I've been wanting to move out of Houston since I moved here almost 3 years ago. I'll be moving to NYC, where I have friends and family, and where I want to make a fresh start. I have very few friends in Houston, and my social life is basically a whisper as a result. I have an overwhelming need to start new, discover my passions, and put my whole self into a brand new life.

Another piece of background: In May, my long term long distance relationship ended after almost a year of long distance where I had prepared to make the sacrifice and move up to the person I thought was the one. It was a miserable year spent lonely and held together solely by the hope of finally moving in with her.

Back in August, I started dating this girl. She and I hit it off right away, and I found that more things clicked as the time went on. I broke things off in October just before the girlfriend talk, because I was actively searching for jobs that could move me to NYC, and I was so broken down from the long distance I had endured before that I didn't want to waste another year waiting for something that might never arrive. This past week I reached back out to ask if she wanted to get coffee and catch up, and we unexpectedly felt even more connected than our last date.

We have a ton of overlap in music taste, senses of humor, interest in hiking and traveling, and ways we flirt and show affection. We also have similar views on kids, religion, politics, and a lot of that core stuff. She's my type as well, so she truly checks every box. The only feeling of doubt I have is that occasionally we aren't perfectly in sync in the way I've felt in that prior relationship, but I know that that comes from spending time together and developing that perfect back and forth. Essentially, if I wasn't moving, she'd be my girlfriend.

But I am. I am moving explicitly to cut the weight of my current state and live the life I've always wanted that I was missing out on in my prime years. I get sick thinking about how much time I've spent waiting around to finally be able to pursue things with my whole heart, and I want nothing more than to try and fail and try again at my passions. She wouldn't prevent me from pursuing my passions, but I would be waiting yet again for life to finally fall into place, planning around this other person, and doing it all on a hope that she's the one.

The counter arguments are that she's a far better communicator than my last LDR, we'd be able to fly to each other for a full week at a time since we work from home, and best of all, she'd happily move to NYC once her current lease is up in March.

The voice inside my head is constantly arguing with itself and flip flops like a senator in an election year, screaming ""just try it out and see, and then if it works out you'll be with an awesome person! People like that don't just grow on trees!"", then 10 minutes later screaming ""you cannot hold onto a person you're not certain about just so that you can avoid having to feel like you missed out, you're going to be a man in his prime in a city of 8 million people, and if you hold on to feelings from this old life, you won't be able to start completely fresh and figure out what it is that makes you truly happy outside of the humor and affirmation and affection of a significant other.""

Those voices won't shut up and I'd really like them to! Any advice would be extremely appreciated!",2,1742437113.0,relationship_advice,1,0.76,False
