My husband (30M) and I (27F) moved to the UK from South Africa just over a year ago, and we’re trying to get a sense of how we’re doing financially, and more importantly, how we can improve.

**OUR SITUATION:**

* Both working as designers, he earns **£32k/year**, I earn **£30k/year**. 
* After tax + NHS/dental contributions, take-home is approx. **£2,176 (him)** and **£1,964 (me)** monthly.
* We currently have:
   * **£20k** in a **cash ISA** earning 4.12% interest
   * **£6k** in a **joint emergency fund** earning 3% interest
   * I also have a South African living annuity (approx. **£23k equivalent**) but I can only withdraw about **£3k per year**until it’s depleted. I take that out every November.
* We’ve paid our rent upfront until **Nov 2025**, so right now we’re saving aggressively.
* We don't have kids, or plan to have kids. We do have a furry one though (single cat)
* We dont own any credit cards, or have any debt.
* Not important, but he has a UK passport and I'm on a spousal visa so I'll need to spend another 4k ish in the next 2 years on my renewal.

**MONTHLY BUDGET:**

* **Total monthly spend**: around **£1,800–2,000 total**, covering food, bills, transport to work, fuel, odd expense, etc.
* We currently spend about £300 each to go into the office, I have plans to work from home going forward and hubby is still working on that. (London)
* Current savings routine:
   * £600 each to personal savings
   * £650 each to joint savings
* By the end of 2025, we estimate having:
   * **£20k** in the ISA
   * **£10k** in the joint account **(I plan to put 7.5k of this into the above cash ISA, and then begin the process next year of topping this up)**
   * **£3kish each** in personal savings (though this fluctuates so cant guarentee)

Our personal savings are used for individual day-to-day spending, like coffee or lunch out, hobbies, and general lifestyle purchases like clothing It’s not really long-term savings, more of a flexible buffer that helps us avoid putting everyday spending on credit. If something unexpected comes up, like a dentist visit for myself, it usually comes from this. It also covers small purchases for our home, things for our cat, and bits and pieces that pop up during the month. I (27F) tend to be a bit more focused on saving mine, while my husband (30M) uses his more freely (he’s really into gaming) We both also dip into it for travel, going out, and exploring new places :) w’re still new to the UK and trying to enjoy the experience while building our future.

**FUTURE BUDGET when rent resumes):**

* **£1,000 each/month** for bills + living
* **£500 each/month** to joint savings
* **£300 each/month** to personal savings

**GOALS:**

* Buy a house in the Bedford area in \~5 years.
* Target price range: **\~**£350?k
* Hoping for salary increases in that time, but we’re not in high-income brackets right now as we took the first jobs we could get when we arrived! 

**SO**

1. How are we doing? Are we on track for a £350k home deposit in 5 years?
2. Could our savings strategy be improved? Should we be putting more into stocks, bonds, or different ISAs? I’m a bit confused about the best options between Cash ISAs, Stocks & Shares ISAs, or other investment vehicles. (Im really not knowledgable on this stuff and whats best, Im clueless and I prefer easy and stress-free.)
3. Is it too risky to only keep savings in cash accounts with interest, or is that okay for our time frame?
4. Any tips for getting more clued up on UK investing and finance?
5. I know someones gonna say put less in personal savings haha!

We feel a bit behind since we’ve only just started building a life here, but we’re trying to make the most of it. Any feedback or advice would be hugely appreciated — thank you!

  
**ALSO! All figures are rough and slightly variable, especially with living costs and savings changing month to month. Apologies if the math isn’t perfect, but this is more or less the structure and plan we've been following. :)**

 **Sandeep:** Cocktails are getting increasingly bolder in India as Indian bartenders and mixologists embrace global cocktails, their techniques and ingredients and marry them with Indian flavours. While classic cocktails are still very popular, there is a significant level of experimentation reshaping the cocktail scene in India.

This trend of innovative cocktails is relatively new and has gained momentum in the last five years. Majorly because of the young generation of bartenders and mixologists who are redefining the craft by creating concoctions with homegrown mixtures and ingredients. Driven by the desire to stand out, they are pushing the boundaries of India’s [**Cocktails Promo**](https://spiritsandrituals.com/global-trending-tipples/cocktails-promo/) culture.

 

**Q2. ⁠India is a whisky-drinking nation. Are they open to experimenting with whisky too in the form of quirky cocktails? What is your observation?**  
 **Sandeep:** India is a whisky drinking nation, we are the world’s largest whisky consuming nation but at the same time, a growing trend of lighter spirits like cocktails is also being observed. In fact, classics like the Manhattan and Old Fashioned, which feature a reasonable base of whisky, is a popular drink amongst Indian drinkers.

While whisky is less commonly used as a base for cocktails compared to other spirits, it still holds its ground. Indian whisky drinkers enjoy whisky based cocktails usually in the afternoons, evenings or sometimes as a weekend drink.

 

**Q3. ⁠What are the most unique ingredients you have seen being added to whisky cocktails?**  
**Sandeep:** It’s interesting to see how mixologists are crafting unique recipes with unconventional ingredients. One such example is coffee, which is emerging as an interesting and unique addition to the cocktail recipe.

Indian native chilies, not the bird eye which is extremely strong but the milder ones are adding depth to the flavors. Foraging in the forest for new kinds of roots and herbs is also becoming an exciting trend. Additionally, use of salts with different texture and taste is also adding a touch of craftsmanship to the overall recipes.

 

**Q4. ⁠How do you view the future of the cocktail scene in India?**  
**Sandeep:**  The response to cocktails in India has been extremely positive and receptive. The future of cocktails in India looks very bright. As global brands make their way to the Indian market, new categories of spirits like tequila are gaining popularity while Indian spirits like Mahua are also making their mark.

Young Indian bartenders are learning global techniques and marrying them with Indian ingredients, bringing a fresh perspective to the [**Mixology Cocktails**](https://spiritsandrituals.com/spirits-and-rituals/) scene. Global cocktailers, bar takeovers with international mixologists are also proving to be invaluable learning experiences for Indian bartenders. With young and exciting individuals taking up bartending as a profession, the future of cocktails in India is extremely positive and bright.

Creating an Effective 1500 Calorie Low Carb Diet Meal Plan for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you looking to shed some pounds while enjoying delicious meals? A 1500 calorie low carb diet meal plan can be an effective way to help you reach your weight loss goals. This approach not only limits your carbohydrate intake but also keeps you feeling satisfied with nutritious options. Let’s explore how you can create an effective meal plan that suits your lifestyle and dietary preferences.

### Understanding Low Carb Diets

Low carb diets focus on reducing the intake of carbohydrates and replacing them with protein and healthy fats. This helps your body enter a state called ketosis, where it burns fat for energy instead of carbs. A 1500 calorie diet is a reasonable daily limit for many adults, promoting a gradual and sustainable weight loss.

### Key Components of a 1500 Calorie Low Carb Diet

To craft a balanced 1500 calorie low carb meal plan, consider these key components:

- **Lean Proteins:** Choose chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, and plant-based proteins to meet your protein needs.
- **Healthy Fats:** Incorporate avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil for essential nutrients.
- **Low Carb Vegetables:** Fill your plate with leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and zucchini.
- **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water is crucial; don’t forget herbal teas or black coffee.

### Sample 1500 Calorie Low Carb Meal Plan

A successful meal plan should be practical and enjoyable. Here’s a sample plan to inspire you:

#### Breakfast (Approx. 350 Calories)

- 1 small avocado (160 calories)

#### Snack (Approx. 150 Calories)

- **Plan Ahead:** Set aside time each week to create your meal plan and shopping list.
- **Prep Your Meals:** Cook and pack your meals in advance to avoid last-minute unhealthy choices.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Monitor how you feel. Adjust portion sizes or food choices if needed.
- **Stay Active:** regular physical activity will boost your weight loss journey.

### Make It Your Own

Your meal plan doesn’t have to be one-size-fits-all. Feel free to swap ingredients based on your preferences or what’s available in your local store. The goal is to enjoy your food while adhering to your calorie and carb limits.

By following this 1500 calorie low carb diet meal plan, you can create a path to weight loss that feels rewarding and satisfying. Stay consistent, listen to your body, and make adjustments as needed to keep your journey both enjoyable and effective.

The Health Benefits of Following a Low Carb Diet for Daily Nutrition
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Following a low carb diet can lead to several significant health benefits that enhance daily nutrition. If you’re tired of feeling sluggish or dealing with weight fluctuations, a low carb diet may be the right choice for you. It emphasizes minimizing carbohydrate intake while focusing on proteins and healthy fats. Here’s how you can benefit from a low carb diet.

### Weight Management

One of the primary advantages of a low carb diet is its effectiveness in supporting weight loss. By reducing carbohydrate intake, your body starts burning fat for fuel instead of sugar. This process, known as ketosis, can help reduce body fat more effectively.

- **Reduces hunger:** Low carb diets often lead to satiety, which means you feel fuller for longer. This might reduce overall calorie intake.
- **Promotes fat loss:** The shift to fat as a primary energy source can lead to significant weight loss, particularly in the abdominal area.

### Improved Blood Sugar Levels

People with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance can see remarkable improvements by reducing carbohydrate intake. Lowering carbs can help stabilize blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity.

- **Decreased insulin levels:** Lower carbs mean less glucose in the bloodstream, resulting in reduced insulin production.
- **Better glycemic control:** This can lead to fewer spikes in blood sugar and improved overall management of glucose levels.

### Enhanced Mental Clarity

Many people report clearer thinking and better focus on a low carb diet. Without sugar crashes and stable energy levels, mental clarity tends to improve when your brain utilizes ketones as a source of energy.

- **Reduced brain fog:** Limiting carbs can lead to more consistent cognitive performance throughout the day.
- **Stable energy levels:** Maintaining energy without the rollercoaster effect of high glucose can help you stay focused.

### Heart Health Benefits

A low carb diet can also contribute positively to heart health. Lowering carbohydrate intake may help manage cholesterol levels and blood pressure, both crucial for cardiovascular health.

- **Improved lipid profiles:** Many studies show that low carb diets often result in higher levels of HDL (good cholesterol) and lower levels of triglycerides.
- **Blood pressure reduction:** Lower insulin and weight loss can help bring blood pressure down.

### Reduced Inflammation

Chronic inflammation is linked to a variety of health issues, including heart disease and diabetes. Following a low carb diet can reduce inflammation in the body.

- **Less refined sugars:** Cutting out sugary foods can substantially lower inflammation markers.
- **Increased nutrient intake:** Focusing on whole foods like vegetables, nuts, and healthy fats leads to better overall nutrition.

### Better Physical Performance

As your body adapts to burning fat for fuel, many individuals experience enhanced physical performance. Whether you’re into weightlifting or running, the benefits can be profound.

- **Improved endurance:** Fat is a more sustainable fuel source, helping you perform longer without fatigue.
- **Accelerated recovery:** Many athletes find they recover faster with fewer sugar-related inflammation issues.

Switching to a low carb diet for your daily nutrition can provide multiple health benefits, from weight loss and improved blood sugar levels to mental clarity and better heart health. As you make this transition, remember to focus on high-quality, nutrient-dense foods. With the right approach, you can significantly enhance your overall wellbeing while enjoying a variety of delicious meals.

Low carb options into your meal plan could be a transformative lifestyle change, providing you energy and vitality throughout your day. the advantages of embracing a low carb diet extend far beyond just weight control, making it a valuable choice for your health.

### Conclusion

Adopting a 1500 calorie low carb diet meal plan can be a transformative choice for those looking to lose weight and enhance their overall health. By carefully selecting your meals, you can create a balanced and satisfying menu that prioritizes nutrient-dense foods while keeping carbohydrate intake in check. This approach not only helps manage blood sugar levels but also aids in boosting energy and reducing cravings, making it easier to stay on track with your weight loss goals.

Beyond weight loss, the health benefits of a low carb diet are considerable. Many individuals find that lowering their carbohydrate intake can lead to improved heart health, enhanced mental clarity, and better digestion. As you embrace this lifestyle, you're likely to notice an increase in satiety, which can help reduce the impulse to snack mindlessly between meals. This newfound focus on whole, nutritious foods means you'll likely be fueling your body with vitamins and minerals essential for daily nutrition.

Ultimately, the key to success with a 1500 calorie low carb diet meal plan lies in flexibility and personalization. Pay attention to how different foods make you feel, and be open to adjusting your meal plan to suit your preferences and lifestyle. With persistence and a positive mindset, you can reap the rewards of this diet—both in terms of weight management and overall well-being. Embrace this journey, and enjoy discovering new, delicious recipes that support your healthy lifestyle while keeping your calorie intake balanced. Your health journey is not just about weight loss, but fostering long-term habits that contribute to a happier, healthier you.

Everyone else in the house refuse to walk him because they ""don't feel like it."" I've gotten into the habit of doing daily walks but havent been able to walk him the past couple days cause of my POTS. I asked my mom to walk him and I got ignored. It's frustrating. Please note it was not my choice to get Obi. If it were me, I wouldn't have gotten a high energy dog like him. (I still love him ofc)

I am gonna try to get into the pattern of walking, playing, and doing games with Obi daily again, depsite my chronic illness. Even on bad days that I can't get out of bed I know I need too. Because all my mom will do is lay on the couch and cuddle with him, or give him a bone to chew on. My step dad does nothing. My brother works full time 1-9 during the day so he can't do as much


But its just frustrating, I don't know what to do. I didnt ask to have a dog as my full responsibility, I am chronically ill and mentally ill. I start senior year September. Who's gonna energize Obi then? 

The other day, Obi attacked my dog of ten years over a bone. Quinns lower eyelid got torn and his eye squints a bit now. My mom refuses to bring him to the vet. And she still gives Obi bones. 2 hours ago when she gave him one and I asked why she said ""I only gave Obi one, not Quinn."" Won't that encourage Obis resource guarding? I told her we can't give them bones anymore because of Obis behavior and she brushed it off. She said ""if it happens again, it happens again"" when I worried about the idea of Obi attacking again. He also lunged at Quinn this morning and this night when Quinn was laying in his safe spot under the coffee table. Which means Obi is getting territorial over Quinns safe spot. Which means he is likely watching Quinn and targeting stuff Quinn loves. When Quinn eats, Obi will bark at him till Quinn runs away

I told my mom we need to get Obi professional training. Once again she brushed it off. She told me that he will ""learn overtime."" She just keeps telling Obi ""don't bite Quinn!"" while petting him and giving him kisses. When I told her that won't do anything she said ""dogs have the understanding of a toddler.""

I need advice. How do I convince my mom to get Obi training? She's never listened to me. When I told her my step dad was abusive to my brother and I, she didn't believe me. When I told her to stop smoking, she denied and mocked me behind my back. I've told her over and over not to smoke in the car with me, and she still does it sometimes. I've asked her to walk Obi, and every time she tells me to walk him instead. My step dad will defend her and say ""if you want to walk him, go walk him!""

I don't care if my mom works third shift. I don't care if she's got POTS like me. Of course I sympathize, but those aren't excuses to not walk him. And if she stopped spending 140-180 dollars on cigarettes per week perhaps then she'd be more open to getting training for Obi

And I'm hired. Okay, cool? Maybe a bit concerning? I'm told I will be given ""full training"", which makes me feel more at ease. 

Tomorrow's my first day as a barista, I'm learning, except that I'll be the only one actually there and I'd assume I'll be expected to make everything. I suppose I misunderstood, and the training is actually mental, gauging just where the line is drawn for me to have a nervous breakdown.   
I'm told it's due to a sudden shortage, and the expected traffic is minimal. I doubt that makes this ""okay"", but whatever, let's wing this.   
While I will maintain plausible deniability in case shit goes wrong, I'd also really like it **not** to. Looking up barista courses online leads to less-than-stellar results in terms of a full overview, so I turn to y'all in a moment of desperation to stay employed; mind giving me a crash course? 

I need a breakdown of the small details. I get the big picture, but I know I'm gonna fuck up on the small things. For example, you might not tell me to wipe the steam urethra after every use because it's so ""of course, duh"" to you, but it's **really** not to me. 

Thus far, what I've learned is:   
1) The different types of coffee and how to make them   
2) How to steam milk for different beverages (and to use a larger pitcher for double orders, then separate and prepare drinks in order of most to least froth) + to clean the steam tube after every use  
3) You get your ground beans from the machine, then you put it in a diff machine to tap it down, and then it's good to go in the third machine, where bean juice squirts out two holes   
4) Clean your, now-dirtied, improvised beanjuice weapon after every use with a rag  
5) Keep the pitchers for lactose, lactose-free and nut milks separate   
6) ???? Something about grams? 18? 30? I'm not trying to measure out ice for my nostrils. I know that the machine should say something, but the one I saw they have doesn't... really? It's like a triple-nostril thing. Should be 18 grams of ground coffee that then makes 30g of espresso, I get that, but I have no idea where tf to measure it. 

Do I refill the bean machine myself? With what?   
How do you carry a drink platter? Or do customers pick that shit up themselves? I'm ngl, idk how to carry that thing with just one hand if there's drinks on there without spilling. That's some witchcraft shit. 

I don't know what I don't know, so I don't know what I don't ask. Break the process down, if you can? Of your work day, or shift, or whatever? ",4,1755078557.0,barista,4,1.0,False

Tldr: Girl borrows phone to make a quick call for airport pickup, draws it out, doesnt communicate what needs to be communicated when running late to meet someone at the airport. Was that a scam/attempt at one or was she just a bit... slow?

A girl sitting next to me on a commuter train asks if this train was going to the airport. I say I don't think it does. She says oh no, I'm supposed to meet someone there. She doesn't have any sort of bags, so I'm thinking she must be going to meet someone who is about to land. She's maybe in her early 20s. She says she has a prepaid phone and no credit left and asks if she could call her friend from my phone. I say okay, given that we are seated on a crowded commuter train and she can't just run off with my very basic phone model. She calls. I'm right next to her. I expect the call to be succinct and to the point, e.g. ""hey, it's XYZ, I'm calling from a stranger's phone since I'm out of credit. I'm on the wrong train and am running late to come pick you up, stay put/go grab a coffee. And please don't call me back on this number, call my regular number. Again, I can't call you myself because I'm out of credit.""

Something like that...
She calls...and it's nothing like that. They are having a regular chit-chat conversation. She doesn't tell him to call her back on her phone. There also doesn't seem to be some kind if urgency connected to the airport. Phone call ends. I go back to catching up on my phone. Guy calls back MY phone. Still on train. I hand it to her, telling her to tell him to call her back on HER phone. Other commuters are also looking on, perplexed. Hoewever, she doesn't tell him that. I cut the conversation short, because i really need to go through a couple of things before my shift starts. As I get to my destination, she stays on. Weird, because this train is still not going to the airport. As I exit, the guy calls my phone again, but I don't pick up anymore. I can't remember if I texted him to call the girl's number and stop calling this number.

Still, years later, I don't quite understand what was up with that entire interaction? She called a regular cell phone number, not a crazy expensive overseas line. The guy also never called that number again and I didn't get weird messages or calls after. It was also before banking or wallet apps were on everyone's phone. Why didn't she tell him within the first two seconds that her phone was out of credit and she was just borrowing someone else's phone to make a quick call to let him know she was running late? 

I have also contemplated she was just to meet someone for a coffee date at the airport or so...when my mind had gone to meeting someone at the airport = picking someone up. But even then, when it was just to flirt with that guy...she clearly had his number on her phone, so they were in contact before. None of it makes any sense to me. 

It was a lesson regardless, since I've never let anyone use my phone after that, but at the time, I really thought she was on the wrong train to the airport and someone was just stranded there.",1,1755078421.0,Scams,6,0.67,False

I have just launched my first android game and would be glad if you give it a shot!

I have no coding experience and working for a global finance company for more than 10 years. All the things happening in the office was annoying me last months. I was feeling depressed. Favoritism, unfair or unjust promotions, low salaries, agile methodology routines, overtime, etc...

Actually, I am a good gamer and using computers since 1994. So, I though that maybe I can make a game, that makes fun about all this office drama, and shows it in a funnier way. I found a gaming engine named Gdevelop, which needs no coding background. Draw all the visuals pixel by pixel by myself. Found the musics and sound effects on pixabay (where I also credited in the game).

So the game is now online, Escape the Office on Google Play Store.  It is an endless runner, where you are trying to escape the office, but in the end you always find out that there is no escape. There is also a highscore system, counts how far you could run with a global leaderboard, shows the best 15 entries.

My point and what I believe is to be the catch is; your anxiety increases as you run through the office and you need to collect coffees to decrease it, otherwise you die from anxiety. There are also 2 bonuses in the game, one of them is an exit sign, that gives you additional +250 distance points, and a drug looking item, which is an antidepressant actually, and when you take it you anxiety resets.

I know the game still needs more improvements. I may try to add more features like more bonus items or more obstacles to jump over. But this is what it is at the moment. I tried to make it simple but addictive (but with no coding experience, this is already the best I could :))

I have also added admob ads, and tried to make it appear as less as it's possible.

I am here to hear your opinions about the game. I can try to add more features if I can!

Thank you in advance for trying it!

1mozzyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Equipments/comments/1mozzyi/cleaning_descaling_guide/,Cleaning & Descaling Guide,"If you want great-tasting coffee and a machine that lasts for years, cleaning and descaling aren’t optional; they’re essential. Over time, coffee oils go rancid, leftover grounds accumulate in hidden spots, and minerals from your water begin to build up inside your equipment. All of this can lead to bitter flavors, sluggish brewing, and even mechanical issues. A little regular maintenance saves you the headache (and cost) of repairs later on.

# Daily Cleaning

For day-to-day care, make it a habit to rinse and wipe your gear after every use. If you have a coffee maker or espresso machine, empty the basket or portafilter, give it a quick rinse with warm water, and wipe down the group head or shower screen. With manual brewers like a French press or pour-over dripper, hot water and mild soap are usually enough. Grinders need a quick brush-out to keep old grounds from affecting your flavor.

# Weekly Deep Clean

Once a week, give your equipment a deeper clean. This could mean backflushing an espresso machine with cleaning powder (if your model supports it), soaking your portafilters or baskets in a cleaning solution, and wiping down the water reservoir and exterior. These small weekly steps help prevent buildup that’s harder to remove later.

# How Often to Descale

Descaling targets the mineral deposits that build up inside your machine over time. How often you do it depends on your water and how much coffee you make:

* **Soft water + light use:** Every 3–6 months
* **Hard water + heavy use:** Every 1–2 months

Signs you need it now include slower brewing, strange noises, or visible white scale inside the machine.

# How to Descale

* Always check your machine’s manual for specific instructions or recommended products.
* Use a food-safe descaling solution like citric acid or a manufacturer-approved mix. Fill your water tank, run half a brew cycle, let it sit for 15–20 minutes, then finish the cycle.
* Flush the machine with 2–3 full tanks of fresh water afterward to rinse out any remaining solution.

# Extra Tips for Better Maintenance

If possible, filter your water. It not only improves flavor but also slows down mineral buildup so you don’t have to descale as often. Avoid vinegar unless your manufacturer specifically says it’s safe; it can damage seals and leave an unpleasant smell. And if you’re the forgetful type, put a reminder in your phone or calendar so you stay on schedule.

Earlier this year I quit my job in Barcelona because I was starting a business with a partner in Madrid. I put in about 10k euros and I was the one who got the bank loan so we could do it. We planned to open in August/September.

While waiting for that, I moved to Sofia and worked remotely on a bunch of stuff – branding, the website, finding coffee suppliers, POS, all that.

As opening day got closer I started worrying because I might need knee surgery around the same time. I told my partner, at first she was cool with it but later she said she really needed someone in Madrid. I said I’d come but I warned her I might be out for a bit if surgery happened.

Then little by little I felt her pushing me out of decisions. Finally she told me it would be best if I stepped aside. She offered to give me my money back plus 15%, but over 15 months, and I’d no longer be part of the business.

I get that she’s doing a lot there, but without me this wouldn’t have happened. The loan, the money, months of work… now it’s basically worth only €1,500 more than what I put in.

This post is written by me and curated for language by gpt. Idea was to come out and put my thoughts out. 

I’m 31, live in Bengaluru, and earn ₹40L a year.  
I invest monthly. Using SIPs and stocks. I don’t blow up money on gadgets.  
But still — by the 20th, the some anxiety would creep in:  
**“Where the hell did my money go?”**

So I ran a little experiment:  
Tracked every leak for 4 straight weeks.  
No guilt. No cutting back. Just awareness.

# 🧾 Here’s What I Found:

**Week 1**

* ₹699: Zepto midnight grocery run (just coconut water)
* ₹149: random OTT subscription I haven’t used 
* ₹450: Third Wave chill → coffee + pastry combo
* ₹1,200: Swiggy weekend binge (3 orders) ➡️ **Total: ₹2,498**

**Week 2**

* ₹2,300: Swiggy again — my monthly total was ₹6K+
* ₹280: Uber to gym... which I skipped after reaching
* ₹399: Amazon Lightning Deal I don’t even remember now ➡️ **Total: ₹2,979**

**Week 3**

* ₹1,499: “Life-changing” online course
* ₹899: Groceries I had, but bought again in chaos
* ₹850: Dinner I said yes to out of peer pressure ➡️ **Total: ₹3,248**

**Week 4**

* ₹1,800: Therapy/meditation app, used for 4-5 days
* ₹500: Bought a new water bottle because I forgot mine
* ₹2,100: Weekend plan that felt more like FOMO than fun ➡️ **Total: ₹4,400**

🧮 **Monthly Leak Total: ₹13,000+**  
And this is with a gym membership I hadn’t used in 3 weeks 🙃

# 🔁 What I Do Now:

Once every week = Leak Check Day.  
I review my week’s leaks → log them → auto-transfer that amount into a flexible SIP.

No shame. No rules. Just quiet control.  
Feels good to tell my money where to go instead of wondering where it went.

# 📈 Fun Reality Check:

If I save and invest even **₹1,000/month** for 30 years (12% returns):  
→ ₹**35.3 Lakhs**

Now do that with **₹20,000/month** (very doable at ₹40L CTC):  
→ ₹**7 Crores+**

From awareness → automation.

# 🎙️ Why I’m Sharing This:

I have started doing this with others in my circle and we are enjoying it.

I do it on Wednesdays. **I will encourage to start this in your circle** or **if you want to join mine, I am more than happy**

  
We need a *pause button* and a small reset ritual — especially in high-speed cities like Bengaluru.

Here's how teams are finally solving it in 2025 with ephemeral environments and smarter strategies.*

# The Problem Every Microservices Team Faces

You know that moment when your unit tests pass, your integration tests are green, but then production explodes because the payment service can't talk to the order service?

Welcome to the microservices E2E testing paradox:

* **Skip E2E tests** → ship fast, break things spectacularly in prod
* **Do E2E tests** → wait 3 hours for a flaky test suite that fails because someone's coffee spilled on the shared staging server

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

# Why You Can't Just Skip E2E Tests (Trust Me, I've Tried)

I've heard all the arguments:

* ""Contract tests catch everything!""
* ""Unit tests are enough!""
* ""E2E tests create distributed monoliths!""

Here's the harsh reality: **I've never seen a complex microservices system work reliably without some form of end-to-end validation.**

# Real scenarios only E2E tests catch:

* Auth service returns 200, but the JWT format changed slightly → checkout breaks
* Database migration succeeded, but data serialization now fails → user profiles corrupted
* Third-party API started rate limiting → payment flows timing out
* Service mesh config drift → random 500s under load

Contract tests are great, but they can't catch every real-world integration failure.

# The Traditional E2E Hell

Let me paint a picture of classic microservices E2E testing:

    Monday: ""Staging is down, someone deployed a broken auth service""
    Tuesday: ""Who changed the test data? All user creation tests are failing""
    Wednesday: ""Tests are flaky again, let's just merge without them""
    Thursday: ""Production is broken, but tests passed on staging yesterday""
    Friday: ""Maybe we should disable E2E tests...""

# The usual suspects causing this mess:

**Environment Chaos**

* 47 microservices need to be running in perfect harmony
* Shared staging environment becomes a war zone
* ""It works on my machine"" → ""It worked on staging"" → ""Production is on fire""

**Flaky Test Epidemic**

* Race conditions between async services
* Network timeouts in containerized environments
* Data pollution from previous test runs
* Timing issues that only happen on Tuesdays

**Pipeline Bottlenecks**

* One failing E2E test blocks 6 teams from deploying
* Tests take 2 hours to run (when they work)
* Debugging failures requires a PhD in distributed systems archaeology

# The 2025 Solution: How Teams Are Actually Solving This

# 1. Embrace the Inverted Test Pyramid

Stop trying to test everything E2E. Seriously.

**What works:**

* Tons of unit tests (fast, reliable)
* Solid contract tests between services
* **5-10 critical E2E tests** covering core user journeys only

Focus E2E on:

* User registration → first purchase flow
* Critical integrations that can't be mocked
* Cross-service data consistency scenarios

**Don't E2E test:**

* Edge cases (cover with unit tests)
* Every API endpoint combination
* UI styling and layout

# 2. The Game Changer: Ephemeral Preview Environments

This is where the magic happens. Instead of fighting over shared staging:

**Every PR gets its own complete environment:**

1. Open PR → CI spins up full microservices stack
2. Run E2E tests against isolated environment
3. QA/PM can manually test the exact change
4. Merge → environment disappears

**Why this changes everything:**

* Perfect isolation (no more data pollution)
* Production-like testing for every change
* Parallel development without conflicts
* Catch integration bugs pre-merge

Real teams report 70% fewer production incidents after adopting this.

# 3. Make Tests Resilient, Not Perfect

Accept that distributed systems are inherently unreliable. Design for it:

    // Bad: Brittle timing assumptions
    await createUser()
    const order = await createOrder() 
    // Might fail if user not propagated
    
    // Good: Resilient with retries
    await createUser()
    const order = await retry(() => createOrder(), { times: 3, delay: 1000 })

**Resilience patterns:**

* Exponential backoff for eventual consistency
* Circuit breakers for flaky external services
* Idempotent test operations
* Proper correlation IDs for debugging

# 4. Observability Is Your Best Friend

When a test fails across 12 microservices, you need to know exactly what happened:

* **Distributed tracing** for every test transaction
* **Centralized logging** with correlation IDs
* **Real-time metrics** during test runs
* **Automated screenshots/videos** for UI failures

Investment here pays off massively in reduced debugging time.

# Real-World Implementation Strategy

# Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding

* Identify your 5 most critical user flows
* Write basic E2E tests for just those
* Set up basic observability

# Phase 2: Environment Isolation

* Implement preview environments (start with one service)
* Automate environment creation in CI
* Measure impact on development velocity

# Phase 3: Scale and Optimize

* Add contract testing between critical services
* Parallelize test execution
* Optimize for faster feedback loops

# The ROI Is Real

Teams doing this well report:

* **50% faster development cycles** (no more staging bottlenecks)
* **80% reduction in production hotfixes** (catch issues pre-merge)
* **90% less time debugging test failures** (better observability)
* **Actually trusting their test suite** (priceless)

# Tools That Actually Work

**For preview environments:**

* Kubernetes + custom scripts (DIY approach)

# The Bottom Line

E2E testing in microservices doesn't have to suck. The key insights:

1. **Test the right things** \- not everything needs E2E coverage
2. **Isolate environments** \- shared staging is the enemy
3. **Design for resilience** \- embrace eventual consistency
4. **Invest in observability** \- you'll thank yourself later
5. **Shift left** \- catch integration issues in PRs, not production

The teams that crack this nut ship faster, break less, and actually enjoy their deployment processes.

**What's your biggest microservices E2E testing pain point? And what's actually worked for your team?**

We live in a fascinating time where technology is changing the game for all of us, especially with the rise of AI. But here’s the kicker — **many of us are still sitting on the sidelines, missing out on huge monetization opportunities that are sprinting out the door!** It’s like watching your favorite pizza slice get taken by someone who just casually walked up. 🍕 

So, how can we avoid that? Here’s a little breakdown:

### 1. **Embrace AI Tools Like Your Favorite Snack** 🍿
   - **Content Creation:** Ever heard of tools like Jasper or ChatGPT? They can churn out articles, social media posts, and even catchy headlines faster than you can say “Where’s my coffee?” ☕
   - **Design Assistance:** Canva’s AI features can help you create stunning visuals without needing to be the next Picasso. 🎨

### 2. **Identify What Sells** 💡
   - Think about what YOU love to create or share. Is it painting tutorials? Baking recipes? People are literally paying for this stuff because they’re craving expert content. 
   - Tap into trending niches. If you see others thriving by selling their digital products, why not jump in? The opportunity is calling your name! 📞

### 3. **Invest Time in Learning** ⏳
   - Online courses, podcasts, YouTube tutorials — the resources are endless and a lot of them are free! It’s like having a personal mentor, minus the stress of scheduling a coffee date. 
   - **A little bit of learning goes a long way:** You can create digital products like ebooks, courses, or even subscription-based content with knowledge you already have!

### 4. **Network, Network, Network!** 🤝
   - Join online communities (hello, AiContentAutomators!) and connect with like-minded folks. You never know who might collab with you on that great idea you’ve been sitting on. 
   - Share what you’re working on — you might just be surprised by the support or advice that comes your way. 

### 5. **Don’t Sleep on Passive Income Streams** 💤
   - Affiliate marketing, print-on-demand services, or even creating an online shop. If you’re producing quality content, why not find ways to monetize it? 
   - Think about your interests: Are you suddenly passionate about cat yoga? 🐈‍⬛ Then turn that into an online course! There’s a world of possibilities waiting for you!

### 🤔 **So, what’s holding you back?**
I get it; putting yourself out there can feel daunting. But let me be real for a sec. If there’s ever been a time to take risks and explore, **it’s now.** Don’t let fear of failure stop you from chasing those opportunities. If some random dude can *clip his toenails on camera and make money,* you can absolutely share your unique skills!

Imagine telling your future self, “I didn’t leave money on the table. I **grabbed** it!” 💪

Last week, I had to deliver a file to Sarah’s desk. Guess what I saw? A display shelf with at least eight mugs from the kitchen, each with little sticky notes like “Morning Motivation” or “Best Handle for Tea.” She’s basically curated a mug library on her desk.

I asked why she didn’t just bring her own mugs. She said she “gets inspired” by rotating through different cups.

One of them is literally my college alumni mug, which I had to ask for back. She said, “Oh! I thought no one used that one.” Yeah, because you had it for two months, Sarah.",8,1755077678.0,coworkerstories,1,1.0,False

I'm also quite upset while writing so sorry if this is a bit all over the place, I'll try give as much detail as I can.

I got diagnosed with PCOS a couple of days ago (I'm early 20s, in the UK if that helps at all), and I've been feeling really lost and hopeless about it and really want to find some support or community since I don't know anyone with PCOS in my life. When I was diagnosed, the only information I got was that my diet would need to be changed massively and that the only two medications they would suggest for me are metformin and birth control. I can't be on most birth controls due to optical migraine and being at higher risk of stroke as a result.

I've been dealing with symptoms of PCOS since I started having periods as well as symptoms of endo (which I am still trying to get investigated, not diagnosed yet), so it's not like the pain, especially when I do have a period, or acne or unexplained weight gain is new to me, but I just feel so hopeless that there doesn't seem to be any options for me. I've been told that I can't eat a lot of foods that I enjoy, can't drink a lot of things and all of that, and I'm not sure how to cope. I'm worried about ending up lonely since I won't really be able to join in in social activities with my friends, which usually revolve around food or drink, and since my symptoms have progressed over the years, my ability to do more than just meeting for coffee/lunch or short walks around the shops has really reduced.  

The only support links I have been sent by my GP have been about weight loss and increasing fertility, but I've stated several times that fertility is not a concern to me, and that pain management and mental health support would be most helpful. Whenever I try to talk to anyone about it, all I get is comments about weight loss, or that it's not so bad and that I'll find a way to manage which while I know aren't coming from a bad place, do still make me feel bad. I'm not in a position to afford private healthcare so I am stuck on the NHS, and therapists in my area are very expensive. If anyone knows any support groups, or charity services that I could get some help from that would be great and I would really appreciate it. Even just some kind words would be really helpful right now. Sorry that this has been so long, if you've read this far thank you very much for just hearing me out.",1,1755077462.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

Everything is going well for me, I just got a new job and am about to start school which has been a long-term dream 8 years in the making. I’m getting closer with my mom and stepdad

I’m having issues in my relationship and every single time it’s the same thing. I feel I’m being mistreated and then I’m told that I’m selfish, I only care about my own point of view and my own feelings, and that I don’t have anything of value to give 

And I’m talking about all relationships my whole life. I’ve been getting the same feedback for like 10 years no matter how hard I try my brain just doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to

I’ve also had so much going on preparing for school that I forgot my friends birthday and I apologized to her two days later and wished her happy birthday but she’s not speaking to me. 

My boyfriend always asks if I’ve eaten and he’s upset that I never ask if he’s eaten. I just assume he hasn’t and I wait to eat until he gets home. And he wants me to offer to like. Make ramen or something and I do, when I’m getting myself one. But I am not sure how I am supposed to know when to offer to make him one if I’m not making one for myself. I offer to get him a drink when I stand up, or a snack. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I make him miserable and he told me as much. 

I am very afraid of scarcity, I rarely turn down handouts and I don’t feel bad about it (I feel bad about not feeling bad about it) like if someone is offering to pay for something why should I tell them no? And I do offer to pay for my friends sometimes too so it’s balanced but it’s more to show them I care than because I want to. Aren’t I supposed to want to? I feel like I’m just faking being nice to them. But why would I want to give away money when the $5 I spend on their coffee could be $5 that I need later? 

I am just so mind-numbingly selfish and bad. I have nothing to offer anyone but playing the victim and making people pity me. It’s literally what I’m doing right now and I am trying to just type things as factual as possible because I don’t want sympathy I just want to be better and I don’t know how. I feel like a narcissist but I reassure myself by telling myself a narcissist wouldn’t think they are one. But I feel like I’m just saying that to give myself a reason to say I’m not one, and to avoid accountability. 

I was scrolling through my phone and I have no one. All I ever wanted all my life was friends that felt like family, that I could rely on. Normal stuff like helping people move (which I offer to do for my friends when they need it too), but also more serious things like who to call at 2am when I am in crisis and need someone to talk to.

But in most of Western Europe, when I actually expressly ask for an espresso, I generally get a genuinely strong coffee.

My experience in Germany, however, has been that unless I go to a specialty chain coffee shop like Segafredo, it is virtually impossible to have an espresso that is not considerably weak. .

For example, if I go to a local bakery and ask for an espresso, I generally get something that is halfway between an American style ""coffee"" and a genuine espresso. There is even a chain of bakeries where you can choose between a""mild"" coffee and a ""kräftig"" coffee, but even ordering the supposedly stronger coffee, it is really just something slightly stronger than an American style ""coffee"".

1mozb9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mozb9t/i_think_my_friend_22f_is_in_a_slightly/,I think my friend (22F) is in a slightly emotionally abusive relationship with her boyfriend (27M),"My partner and I who have been together for almost 10 years have known my friend (22F) and her boyfriend (27M) for 2 years now, that’s how long they’ve been dating. Let’s call them Josh and Layla. We all work together but I’d like to keep certain details private for anonymity.

Now I think the word abuse is pretty harsh but I honestly don’t know so I would like some more perspectives on this situation. I do feel really odd coming onto reddit but my partner and I have discussed it so much that we thought to bring it on here to get more opinions.

We are all pretty good friends and hang out outside of work. Layla and I have been getting extremely close this year and I would say she is one of my closest friends. 

Lately as we are getting closer I have noticed a few things that I would say are red flags in Josh. Keep in mind we are all friends and I honestly believe he is a lovely person and I’ve never had personal issues with him but I have been noticing some signs that make me concerned.

For some context, In the two years they’ve been dating they have worked in the same workplace and they also live together so they are around each other 24/7. He had a previous relationship before this one that was 4 years long, so he has never really been single. My partner (27M) and I (24F) have been together for 9 years so we also have never really been single, I don’t think that is always an issue but maybe you will see why in this case I think it is.

We had our first girls night last month, we don’t have a lot of other girl friends so this was really exciting for us as we had never had a girls night before. In the lead up to the night Layla expressed to me that Josh was getting in his head about it… this was odd to me as my partner would never get upset about me going out anywhere. She then expressed that he cannot be alone. Layla is a very independent person and loves her alone time. He does not. If she does something by herself (rarely ever) he will just sit at home and wait for her literally saying “I’ll just be waiting for you to get home.” When she has told him that he needs to get used to being on his own and to go out and do things by himself or even for him to go and make friends he says “why would I do that when I have you” 
The girls night was fine, he dropped us off but she was on her phone for a lot of the night texting him. I don’t know what about but every now and then she would say “oh Josh is going to do this” “Josh is getting this for dinner” Layla wasn’t excessively on her phone but it was still enough to annoy me slightly, we had a nice night anyway and he came to pick us up and dropped me home.

Whenever I ask her to go do anything she always says “can Josh come to?” I don’t mind hanging out with him but sometimes you just want to get coffee with your girl friend… I usually will just say okay because I don’t want to be rude but my partner sometimes doesn’t even come with us and it’s getting to the point that I specifically have to word it like “can the two of us go get coffee?” 

We will be hanging out with friends/in a group setting and the two of them will be texting the whole time and you can very obviously tell it’s to each other. Layla has expressed to me that he is a very communicative person and therefore any little thing he gets insecure about he needs to express it to her right then and there but it is ALL THE TIME. She also said that he will just repeat himself over and over again and then bring it all back up when they get home. She has told me she just wants to throw her phone sometimes because she hates doing that while with friends but will follow it up by saying that they have a very secure relationship.. Layla has also told me that if she doesn’t reply straight away he gets annoyed/it makes him more insecure. I truly believe she is in denial about it and I have kindly mentioned to her that he really needs to work on this because I don’t believe it is healthy… Layla said that she has had a stern conversation with him about how he needs to be on his own but he doesn’t think he does. She has told me that he doesn’t really have a close friend outside of her and that because she has found a friend in me he is somewhat upset about it and it’s getting him down. But he doesn’t put himself out there to do that either.. 

The other morning I asked her to coffee, as soon as we left for coffee she was texting, and when we got there more texting. Then she said jokingly and in a light manner that when she left Josh went “it’s fine. I’ll just go and get coffee with Sara then” this is the “name” of a girl that Layla and I don’t really like from work and get an off vibe from. Layla said that he was joking and didn’t really mean it. Josh does make jokes like that often so I know the tone he would have said it in and do believe it was a joke but as my partner says, sometimes jokes have actual truth behind them and joking or not it was obviously meant to get a reaction out of her. All Layla said to him was “okay, go ahead.” As she feels secure and trusts him. He was shocked that she responded like that and didn’t say anything more (that I know of)

Although I don’t believe this is a fully emotionally abusive relationship I do think there are signs of it becoming one? These are also just a few of the interactions and there are so many others of similar nature. My opinion is that this is cannot be healthy right? Or is this somewhat normal and I just don’t know because my relationship is definitely not like this. Would love to know opinions from anyone but especially from people who have been in this kind of relationship before! 

Also I have talked to her about this a few times and she has never seemed overly concerned saying that he is definitely not controlling or anything like that but I feel as though even if he’s not necessarily telling her she can’t go and do things on her own he is making her feel bad, acting sooky and childish when she does?

Her coffee mug was still on the counter, her sweater still on the chair — like echoes of a life that had just evaporated.

I sat on the floor, numb, staring at the space where her shoes used to be.  
Everything in me wanted to call, to beg, to say, *“We can fix this.”*

Instead, I opened my Bible and read:

>

I didn’t feel “healed” instantly, but I realized something: wounds don’t heal because you ignore them; they heal when you let the right hands tend to them.

For me, those hands were God’s.

Carnivore diet and pre-workout

I occasionally add methylane blue twice a week. I don't even use it.

Im wanna learn coding and some learning in general but I struggle with time and find something to do constantly due to my ADHD, yet still I'm doing quite good, but starting them tasks knowing I won't finish them today, not knowing where to start etc makes me not start them at all and breaking through that barrier is almost impossible. I manage my adhd quite well anyway, but daily tasks need to be finished that day or they will never be done. I don't know if im looking for a miracle nootripic or what but for something that i would pop in and made me do learning and doing stuff easier. Sometimes my fixation will take over and all of sudden I will have new hobby and no time for longer learning sessions and never be back to them. Sometimes I add Ashwangharda Cistanche Fadogia agrestis Tongkat Ali to Alpha GPC Omega 3 and Moda after supper from sportresearch, ndepot and highstreetpharma.

I'm very active i workout daily 5-6 days a week I work 7 days a week And doing my daily stuff quite well with language learning etc but can't manage to start something longer term like coding which has been in my mind for long time, but does not add up in my head even tho I'm interested in it but not hyper fixated.

I have used back in 2018 one of those nootropic stack pills for learning but I could not sit down, I wanted to do stuff but I did not want to sit down, which made me very active but with 0 concentration, and I have not touched any learning nootropic related since.

## Key Features Analysis

The beauty and functionality of Toscana Cream Quartz stem from its unique composition and manufacturing process. A composite material, it is indeed primarily made of ground natural quartz, blended with resins, polymers, and pigments to create its distinctive appearance and performance characteristics.

**Composition and Manufacturing:** Toscana Cream Quartz is manufactured by combining approximately 90-93% ground quartz with 7-10% resins, polymers, and pigments. This mixture is then subjected to intense pressure and heat, creating a solid, non-porous slab. The manufacturing process ensures consistent color and pattern throughout the material, which is often lacking in natural stone.

**Durability and Resistance:** One of the most notable advantages of Toscana Cream Quartz is its exceptional durability. The high quartz content makes it resistant to scratches, chips, and cracks. It is also non-porous, meaning it does not absorb liquids, making it highly resistant to stains from common household substances such as coffee, wine, and oils. This makes it ideal for high-traffic areas and surfaces prone to spills.

**Color and Pattern:** toscana Cream Quartz offers a consistent and uniform cream color, often with subtle veining or speckling to mimic the look of natural stone. The color is achieved through the addition of pigments during the manufacturing process, ensuring consistency across slabs. This allows for a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing installation, whether in kitchens, bathrooms, or other areas of the home. Consumers can select from a range of patterns and tones of cream to match a variety of design styles.

**Size and Thickness:** Toscana Cream Quartz slabs are typically available in various sizes, with common dimensions around 120 inches by 55 inches. Thickness options usually include 2 cm (approximately 0.75 inches) and 3 cm (approximately 1.25 inches). The larger slab sizes can minimize the number of seams required for installations, creating a seamless and more visually appealing surface. The varying thickness options allow for use in diverse applications, from countertops to wall cladding.

Each week, I round up four things gnawing at my brain like a poltergeist in a popcorn machine: a game, a comic, a board game, and one piece of tech I probably shouldn’t want, but obviously do.

This week’s lineup is equal parts eerie and adrenaline-fueled: a field recorder that makes you feel like a ghostbuster, a town drenched in fog and dread, a board game that punches harder than your last arcade loss, and a classic monster story that proves invisibility has its perks… and its problems.

Grab your headphones, your lucky dice, and maybe a torch, and let’s see what’s whispering on my wishlist this week.



**Silent Hill f**

[**Check It Out Here** ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/)

Hinako’s hometown isn’t just foggy, it’s a full-blown nightmare with a side of existential dread.

Welcome to Ebisugaoka, Japan, 1960s edition, where the mist obscures the streets and twists reality itself.

You’ll guide Shimizu Hinako through puzzles that make your brain scream and monsters that make your stomach scream louder.

Imagine wandering through a town where every corner hums with regret, doubt, and the faint scent of things you really shouldn’t have touched.

With a haunting story, visuals that are almost too pretty for all this horror, and an Akira Yamaoka soundtrack that slaps right in your soul, Silent Hill f isn’t just a game – it’s a fog-drenched meditation on terror, beauty, and the questionable life choices that led Hinako here.

Will she find the beauty hidden in terror, or will the madness win? I’m not sure I can wait to find out.



**Universal Monsters: The Invisible Man**

[**Check It Out Here**](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/7831741/universal-monsters-the-invisible-man-1)

Jack Griffin has always felt invisible… and now he finally gets the chance to prove it.

Only problem? The experimental invisibility gig also comes with a fast-track ticket to losing your humanity.

James Tynion IV and DANI peel back the layers of horror and obsession in a story that shows you the Invisible Man isn’t just a classic monster, he’s personal.

Every step toward invisibility is a step away from sanity, and every panel makes you wish you’d worn your spectral hazard suit.

If you’ve ever wondered how it feels to watch someone unravel before your eyes while also questioning your own moral compass, this is your next comic binge.

It’s a descent into madness wrapped in shadows, science, and a generous dose of “oh no, he didn’t.”



**Tekken – The Board Game**

[**Check It Out Here** ](https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/tekken-the-board-game)

Imagine the glorious chaos of a Tekken fight, then imagine it sitting on your coffee table.

That’s Tekken – The Board Game.

Two fighters, a handful of cards, and enough combos to make your opponent cry – or at least reconsider their life choices.

Each character keeps their signature style, and the card-driven system turns a fight into a tactical dance of “I hope they didn’t see that coming.”

Use heat, special moves, and stage tricks like wall breaks to crush your opponent’s dreams and maybe their soul.

Whether you’re going head-to-head in base mode or running an eight-player tournament of pure combo chaos, this is your chance to slap your friends in the face with perfectly executed punches, legally, of course.



**TP–7 Field Recorder**

[**Check It Out Here** ](https://teenage.engineering/products/tp-7)

Meet the TP–7 field recorder, a pocket-sized sketchbook that’s secretly a full-on multi-track recording studio.

Quick memo? Check. Mad audio experiment? Check. Loops, cue points, scratching, bouncing tracks? Oh yeah. Basically, if your brain **throws** a brilliant idea at you, the TP–7 catches it before it runs off screaming.

It even transcribes in most languages straight from its app. Tiny polyglot in your pocket? Check. Silent judgment when you forget to hit record? Also check.

One tap on the memo button, even if the TP–7 is off, and you’re recording.

Palm-sized and perfect, the side-mounted rocker lets you fast-forward, rewind, and scrub through audio like a hyperactive DJ on espresso.

Press up to zip ahead, down to rewind, and watch (and hear) the wheel spin like a tiny audio lightsaber.

There are three stereo jacks, USB-C, Bluetooth, and 128 GB storage.

The TP–7 isn’t just a gadget; it’s part of Teenage Engineering’s ultra-portable Field System, which lets you record anywhere, anytime.

Battery-powered, interconnected, and compact enough to fit in your palm, it’s basically a full studio in your hand, disguised as a deceptively cute little gadget.

Why am I obsessed? The TP–7 doesn’t just record sound, it makes your ideas tangible, portable, and immediate.

It’s like having a magic notebook that actually listens. And yes, I want one desperately, because my brain refuses to stop tossing brilliant nonsense at me, and someone has to catch it.



\--  


And that’s a wrap on this week’s descent into temptation.

Whether you’re recording ghostly whispers, surviving fog-shrouded nightmares, landing combos with friends, or feeling a bit invisible yourself, there’s a little obsession here for your own collection.

I’ll be back next week, same cursed hour, same chaotic feed, with four more things I can’t stop thinking about… and will almost certainly try to buy anyway.

Until then, may your dice crit, your cables untangle, and your monsters never catch you unprepared.

1moz2k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1moz2k9/put_myself_in_a_messy_situation/,Put myself in a messy situation,"Rant:

A few months ago a girl came into my friend group and me and another friend in the group instantly got a massive crush on her. We all work at the same company, including the new girl, all of us basically sitting right next to eachother. The group also hang out quite often outside work.

My friend is much more direct than I and started hitting hard on her instantly. She thought it was fun and the same time brushed him off in a light hearted way.

I have very high inhibitions and I'm also quite inexperienced and anxious with girls.

She started to show signs of interest towards me, giving me physical compliments, looking a bit nervous around me, and other signs.

I was jealous of my friends directness and confidence in his approach to her, which I think, combined with my overall anxiousness stopped me from showing any interest back.

I started to feel bad because of the whole situation, but eventually I asked her to meet up and have a beer with me. At this point I was trying to convince myself to see her only as a friend, even though I had a massive crush on her. Probably some kind of coping mechanism. We met for the beer, had a fun time, but nothing romantic.

Some time later I initiated to have a coffee with her. Same thing, good time but I did not make any move at all, or tried to make something romantic out if it.

A few weeks pass and she asks me for coffee. We meet up, same thing. I didn't make any move whatsoever.

At this point my anxiety about the situation is very high. A girl i have a crush and who also seems to be interested in me ""asks me out"" but I make no move. Wtf.

During this time my friend continued flirting with her, with varying response from her. They never hung out by themselves outside work but had some humouros ""fictional relationship"". Even though in hindsight i realise i was probably her ""top guy"" as she hung out with me outside work, i was very jealous of their flirting, which also effected how i acted around her. I got very tense and stuck up around her, especially when my friend was also present.

This weird dynamic has been going on for 6 months now, both me and her asking eachother to hang out once in a while but nothing happens. And she keeps showing what i would say are some signs of interest.

To keep it short(!) (I could write forever about all the aspects of this), last week she asked if i wanted to have dinner with her. I decided this would be the moment i finally show what i want and start flirting, or at least complimenting her. This was going to be the world cup final. 30 minutes before the dinner she texted that her friend (another girl in the group, also my friend) wanted to join. Fuck, haha. World cup final gone.

A few days later we had a dinner party, myself, the girl, the female friend mentioned above, and the other guy in the drama (the competitor).

For me the party was a train wreck, my friend took over the scene completely. I was insecure, not having fun, not being fun, got too drunk. The girl has pretty much only focusing on him, understandably so. The whole vibe between us that night just felt completely wrong.

Here I am a few days later thinking what to do. The whole thing is affecting my life incredibly badly, I'm thinking about it every waking second. Just want it to end.

So, where should I go from here?

1. Just promise myself to completely move on from her for my own mental health.
2. Give it one more final shot, ask her to meet up and show what I want. World cup again. This option feels wrong right now because of the bad vibes from the dinner party. I could of course have misread that situation, being too sensitive to rejection, believing myself to be overall ""rejected"" just because i wasnt the main focus that night
3. Not contact her and see if she contacts me, and then ask her out and go for the world cup.

This is achieved through a combination of flavor ingredients and breath fresheners that linger in the mouth after brushing.The formulation is designed to combat bad breath odors at their source and provide a prolonged feeling of freshness, enhancing user confidence.

**Foaming Action:** The toothpaste features an effective foaming action thanks to surfactants, which help to loosen and remove debris and plaque from the teeth and gums. This ensures throughout cleaning, reaching between teeth and along the gum line. The foam also aids in distributing the active ingredients evenly throughout the mouth.

Currently using Timemore S3, actually it can grind some espresso in correct timerange, but working one two clicks from ""zero"". I am wondering which way should I go, i am more focused on pourover quality coffee. My girlfriend drinks americano everyday in the moring SO it have to be able to pull espresso, but in terms of quality it can be worse. So to sum up definitely i opt for pourover qualitywise. Now 2 ways i consider. Going top tier handgrinder or quite entry level electric.
My options considering converted price in my country are:
- 1zpresso K ultra(320 usd)
- Fellow opus(192 usd)
- Baratzza encore ESP(205 usd)
- Df 54(320 usd)
- Df 64 gen 2(470 usd)

My concerns are:
- 1zpresso - having to grind manually which is not big problem for me, but doing it everyday for my gf can be a problem
- Fellow- heard of big retention
- Baratzza- loud and cheap looking
- Df 54- problem with dialing, but i like the price, probably Not going to change burrs
- df 64- costs the most and JH in his comparison was Not happy with its filter coffee

If you’re driven, love learning, and want a community that pushes you forward, let’s connect.

About me: NIT dropout, sports kid turned music/film professional. I run a video production firm (luxury/wedding/destination) and I’m obsessed with tech, software, and the internet. 
Still big on sports, play badminton regularly and i am happy to mix games with career/product chats.

Why this group: It’s hard to find sharp, like‑minded people locally, and I believe the right community can change the trajectory. Age is no barrier, if you’ve got curiosity, drive, and the spark to try something bold, you’ll fit right in.

What we’ll do:
	•	Meet, talk, and collaborate on ideas
	•	Share feedback, resources, and accountability
	•	Explore startup/tech/product opportunities together
	•	Hang out over badminton or coffee

If this resonates and you feel you are also stuck with things in life and not getting the right company or community, drop a comment or DM with a line about what you’re working on or curious about.

So I was wondering if I can get a grind-by-weight grinder, use it to pre-grind an entire bag of coffee into individual doses, and then store them in single dosing tubes in the freezer.

This method would not only solve the problem of not having a grinder at one location, but it would also give me the flexibility to have a variety of different pre ground single dosed coffees on hand, which is usually a limitation of hopper-fed grind by weight grinders.

Last weekend, I had a gut feeling to check his phone. On a messaging app we don’t normally use, I found chats with his ex-colleague. They met regularly for coffee, just the two of them - something he never once mentioned. When talking about work, he’d say “people from HR” instead of using her name.

During his time at that company, our relationship felt distant. I’d often say, “It feels like we have nothing to talk about anymore.” Now I wonder if it’s because he was already sharing with her.

In the messages:
	•	She texted about lunch, and he replied, “I’ll go into the office for you.”
	•	He bought her a muffin because she “wasn’t eating well.”
	•	They joked about another colleague giving them a curious look.

When I confronted him, he said he hid it because he thought I’d “overthink” and promised not to do it again. Later, he told me she has a boyfriend (her direct boss). Still, I don’t think that excuses my husband’s secrecy or behavior.

I don’t believe there was physical intimacy, but it feels like there was emotional intimacy. His new job is near her office, and I’m worried they’ll continue their “ritual.” He knows I see emotional affairs as worse than physical ones. I’m not sure I can trust him again.

TLDR: Husband hid regular one-on-one coffee meetups with a female colleague, bought her food, and avoided mentioning her to me. I think it was an emotional affair, and I’m struggling with trust.",9,1755072967.0,Marriage,6,0.91,False

1moym6r,https://i.redd.it/vw1aqforwqif1.png,Why Digital Billboards Are Trending and Outperforming Static Formats on every metric,"# A Shift in the Billboard Landscape

The advertising world is buzzing with one fast-moving trend: **digital billboards** (aka DOOH - Digital Out-of-Home). Far from a niche, these dynamic displays ranging from LED screens to programmatic platforms are rapidly reshaping out-of-home advertising.

# Why Digital Billboards Are Trending in 2025

* **Rapid growth in adoption**: DOOH ad spending has soared from just 17% of total OOH spend in 2015 to an estimated 42% by 2023 
* **Strong market momentum**: Industry projections forecast sustained growth, driven by DOOH’s agility and impact 
* **Increased campaign agility**: Digital billboards let advertisers update content instantly, whether triggered by weather, traffic, or trending events

# Advantages Over Static Billboards

# A. Real-Time Flexibility & Dynamic Content

* Digital ads can be changed on the fly track real-time events, push timely promos, or adapt to changing contexts.
* Schedulers can optimize content based on time, weather, or audience behavior.

# B. Advanced Measurement & Targeting

* DOOH platforms integrate analytics using sensors, mobile data, geolocation, even computer vision to deliver actionable metrics like impressions, dwell times, and campaign conversions.
* Programmatic DOOH allows automated media buying and performance tracking, enhancing ROI.

# C. Engagement & Recall Significantly Higher

* Digital billboards are reported to achieve **up to 400% higher engagement** compared to static billboards.
* Another source claims digital displays capture **400% more views** and boast an **83% recall rate**, far exceeding static formats.
* Improved retention and memorability reinforce brand messaging effectiveness.

# D. Cost Efficiency & Environmental Benefits

* While digital setups may have higher initial costs, they eliminate recurring print and installation fees and offer flexible pricing some platforms even allow campaigns from **$20/day**.
* One study cites a **$5.97 return in sales for every $1 spent** on DOOH.
* Digital formats are also more energy-efficient and eco-friendly than traditional billboards.

# E. Creative & Strategic Flexibility

* Digital platforms support high-definition animations, videos, 3D, interactive elements like QR codes delivering richer, more engaging storytelling.
* Enables micro-targeting by schedule, location, or demographic e.g., coffee promos during morning rush, sunscreen ads on sunny days.

# Digital vs. Rolling Ads in Sequence

Digital billboards often share a looped rotation of messages (similar to ""rolling ads""). However:

* While **static rolling ads** rely on fixed cycles and can't update mid-run, **DOOH roulette ads can adapt content in real-time**, reordering creative based on context or performance.
* **Real-time rotation + dynamic context** gives DOOH a clear edge over static sequential ads.

# Conversion Metrics in a Nutshell

While exact real-time conversion stats are less common, available data shows:

* Up to **400% more engagement and views** for digital formats.
* **Recall rates** climb as high as **83%** for digital vs. static.
* Return on ad spend for DOOH can soar to nearly **6× returns**.
* Digital offers direct measurement of viewership and actions - strongly missing in traditional static formats.

# The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

As noted by OOH experts: *“Traditional formats are brilliant for long‑term brand awareness... Digital shines when you need flexibility, speed, and the ability to run multiple creatives.”*

A blended strategy - using static for enduring presence, digital to react and optimize often delivers the strongest results.

# Safety Considerations & Regulatory Oversight

* **Authorities and road safety experts** in several regions have raised concerns that highly animated or overly bright digital billboards could distract drivers.
* Regulations vary widely:
   * In the U.S., the **Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)** allows digital billboards but sets guidelines on **brightness, dwell time, and transition speed** to limit distraction.
   * Some cities and countries restrict the use of **full-motion video or rapid transitions** on highways.
* Studies are mixed, some research finds **no measurable increase in accidents** near compliant digital billboards, while other studies suggest **slight increases in driver gaze time** away from the road.
* Industry best practices to mitigate risk include:
   * Setting dwell times of **8-10 seconds** per creative.
   * Avoiding flashing or strobing effects.
   * Maintaining brightness that adjusts to ambient light conditions.
* The consensus: **When operated within safety guidelines, DOOH can coexist with traffic safety goals** but advertisers and operators must respect local laws and ethical considerations.

# Interactive DOOH: A Glimpse Into Two-Way Engagement

* Beyond passive viewing, a new wave of **interactive DOOH** is emerging in **tourist-heavy, high-foot-traffic locations**.
* These installations combine **touchscreens, cameras, and connectivity** to create a two-way experience:
   * Offering **local maps, tourist guides, and event listings**.
   * Allowing visitors to **take selfies or group photos** with themed digital backgrounds and send them instantly to their email or social media.
   * Providing QR codes for quick downloads, special offers, or app installs.
* The benefits for brands and cities are massive, each interaction creates a **memorable, shareable moment**, while capturing valuable data (with consent).
* This topic is **big enough for its own deep dive**, where we can explore:
   * **Case studies** from New York, Tokyo, and Barcelona.
   * Integration with **gamification** and **social media contests**.
   * How interactive DOOH turns tourists into brand ambassadors.

# The Future: Hyper-Targeted DOOH Through Pattern Recognition & Data Integration

* **Emerging technologies** are pushing DOOH beyond location-based targeting into real-time audience personalization.
* **Computer vision & pattern recognition**: Cameras embedded in or near billboards can anonymously detect characteristics such as **age range, gender, clothing style, or group size** to trigger context-relevant ads.
* **Cross-data integration**: Some experimental systems link with **mobile device data, loyalty apps, or geofenced social media profiles** (opt-in) to display ads based on nearby consumers’ interests or past purchases.
* **Dynamic contextual triggers**: Weather, traffic density, event schedules, and even sports scores can swap creatives instantly to match the audience mood.
* **Example**: A DOOH screen in a transit hub could detect a cluster of travelers with ski gear and automatically serve winter sports equipment ads, or display coffee offers to morning commuters detected via travel patterns.
* **Privacy & regulation**: While most systems claim **anonymization**, the blending of pattern recognition with consumer data raises **GDPR, CCPA, and ethical concerns**. Future adoption will depend heavily on transparent consent mechanisms and clear guidelines.",0,1755072917.0,PhysicalMarketing,0,0.5,False
