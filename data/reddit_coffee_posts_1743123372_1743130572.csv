After lurking for a long time and getting a LOT of helpful suggestions, I thought I would give back and add to the pile of reviews on here.

These are candles from my hauls over the last year or so! 

The ratings try to convey how good they are in general, and/or how much they capture what is on the label…

**1 - RAINBOW SUGAR**

Ok, I’m going to get this one out of the way. I truly think… hope… that I got a mislabeled candle or a bad batch or something. From other reviews, I was envisioning anything from Spree to  Starburst to Cotton Candy. It smells like warm Jergens© hand lotion. I wish I was exaggerating.

**0/10**

**2 - GRAPE SODA**

Much better news. The prevalent reviews talk about its uncanny similarity to its namesake. These reviews are dead on. This smells so much like grape soda, you can almost smell the carbonation.

**10/10**

**3 - POP TARTS**

**Cherry** \- Worth trying. Semi-generic cherry smell, but a bit of pastry to give it a pop tart vibe. **7.5/10**

**Blueberry -** GOOD, but being held back by a blueberry that smells slightly grape/ wine like.  **6.5/10**

**Brown Sugar - Very disappointing**. I LOVE the pop tart of the same name. This is an eye-watering cinnamon bomb. No subtleties, pastry or brown sugar to cut it. Get it if you crave a life of cinnamon dreams, and many trips to the medicine cabinet for Visine. **3/10**

**4- Christmas Village**

My wife had been searching for a good ‘straight peppermint’ candle for a while. This makes your house smell like you are living in the middle of one of those meltaway peppermint balls. Enveloping, yet somehow subtle. You ‘feel’ the peppermint without the sharpness; You’re living in a peppermint cloud.

**9/10**

**5- Gingerbread donut**

As above, my wife had been searching for a ‘good gingerbread’ candle.

Sadly, the search continues…

**3/10**

**6- Campfire Marshmallow**

The throw is a bit light… but if you put in the effort, she will reward you.

A haiku is in order:

Subtly smoky

A sweet marshmallow feeling…

On a winters’ night.

**8.5/10**

**7- Coffee House**

The search continues for a good, basic coffee candle; the chocolate notes are too pronounced. Would like this better if it were called ‘Mocha House’. 

As Mocha house, I’d give it a 9.

As Coffee house, it gets

**6.5/10**

**8- Sugared Apple Granola**

Simple review- smells as though you are baking an apple crumble. 

**9/10**

**9- Toasty Pumpkin Toddy**

Not sure how to properly describe it. Definitely has a very ‘adult’ vibe. Reminds me of old fashion alcohol beverages from a bygone era, a bit of musk, and an almost a tobacco like quality. Really complex, but in a delightful way. 

Would not blindly recommend this, but I love it.

**9.5/10**

**10 - Key Lime Cake Pop / Limoncello Cupcake**

I lump these together because they have the same pros and cons. They both have great throw and definitely convey their respective citrus baked good flavors. That being said, they both have an underlying… odd element to them? I THINK the smell is supposed to convey the ‘baked’ aspect, but instead it just… distracts and detracts. Good and maybe worth a try, but not sure I would re-buy.

**6/10**

**11 - Red, White and Blue**

You know those Red, White and Blue ice ‘Bomb Pops’ On the label?

That.

**10/10**

**12- Watermelon Bubble Gum**

You know those watermelon bubble gums of old… like Bubble Yum, Hubba Bubba, etc?

That.

**10/10**

**13 - Boardwalk Cone**

Decent. I feel like it could be SLIGHTLY better as far as evoking the ‘cone’ element, but a pleasant experience overall.

**7/10**

**14 -Strawberry Sponge Cake**

Jury is out on this. Heard nothing but rave reviews. Its strength is also its negative. It smells almost TOO real: You know when you get a strawberry cake at a bakery and it sometimes has that ‘artificial/jellied’ strawberry sauce on it? That note is a bit TOO present. But high marks for realism…

**7.5/10**

**15 - Lemon Butter Cake**

Another baked good with rave reviews. It doesn’t overwhelm like, “Holy crap is that lemon cake’?!”, But it does reward those who appreciate the subtle nuances; The initial smell is underwhelming… and then…wait… is that… is that a burnt piece of pound cake? The lemon starts to poke its head out… and then once again takes a backseat to the pound cake. Not as amazing out of the gate as the reviews suggest… but if you let the candle breath and present it’s different sides to you, you will enjoy it for its realism

**8.5/10**

**16 - Strawberry Shortcake Orange Blossom**

A mix between Orange Soda and that delightful orange Baby Aspirin... and of COURSE that's a good thing. Feel like it could be betTER, but pretty good overall

**8/10**

We were living in California for university neither of us are native so when we started dating we always said we wanted to meet her family but just never made it happen she's from Wyoming and I'm from NY so we always choose to visit mine because she said her town would have nothing to do. It wasn't even a full year since graduation and even with the best jobs we could find right after we still couldn't afford rent. So her family offered us a break saying if we moved in with them we wouldn't have to pay rent we could save money for as long as it takes to hopefully buy our house.

Obviously it wasn't my first choice but we both felt like we needed to humble ourselves because clearly we can't afford city life. It was good for the first few weeks since we were both hired almost instantly (healthcare and teaching). Her mom and younger siblings are great but there's something about her dad that makes me feel uncomfortable. He's a family doctor so I thought his comments about my body were because of that at first. He's tried to give me a saying my pastor was bad, give me a call, tell my body had beautiful porpotions, etc. The the worst two I can think of was when I had a fever and I wss resting my eyes, and he came in and sat on the edge of the bed. Then I felt him rubbing his hands on my hips he thought must have I was sleeping.

 I told Anna and she said he was just checking because I was sick. Another time he was showing me his drawings which I already didn't want to see, and then he told me I had ""lips like a woman"" and he asked to draw me. He wanted me in my underwear so I kept saying no and he kept said was fine because he's a doctor. Then he tried to close the door, but thank God, my MIL and their kids came home because I wonder if you would forced me if they weren't there. This time I told Anna and and she actually did agree to confront him too but then she and her mother ended up defending him saying it was all a misunderstanding and they were just an affectionate family. He was didn't even try to act humiliated during dinner that night he kept looking at me...

At first I didn't wanna complain or seem ungrateful especially since we're in such a good position to save money but even now it's starting to not feel worth it I'm not making as much money as I thought and neither is she certainly not enough to buy a house anywhere outside of Wyoming. Her dad keeps making me more and more uncomfortable each day two weeks ago he that I have a small so I would be easy to carry. It was so random he hadn't even said anything before that he just came up behind me while I was making my coffee. I wonder if he was trying to threaten me? I told my brother and he thought it was funny. He basically brushed me off, saying he was probably just old and creepy, but at least I don't have to pay rent. Yesterday, I told him that I wanted to break up if her dad kept being creepy but Anna got mad at me saying I was being dramatic, I'm paranoid, and I just don't like her family. I feel like I'm the only one who sees him as creepy.",1,1743130247.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1jll3bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1jll3bv/to_the_friend_i_miss/,To the Friend I Miss,"Hi M,

I don’t even know where you went.
I don’t know the moment you stopped being reachable, or when the light in your voice dimmed.
I just know I miss you.
Not the dream, not the maybe-one-day version of us—
Just you.

You used to talk to me like I mattered.
You used to open up, share your thoughts, your humor, your heart—even the parts you said you didn’t show anyone else.
You made me feel safe without trying.
And I think I made you feel understood.

And maybe that was the problem.
Maybe being seen made you want to disappear.

But god, I miss the simplicity of it.
The softness.
The knowing glances.
The way I didn’t have to prove anything to earn your attention.
The way your silence wasn’t a weapon back then—it was just space. Gentle, honest space.

Now, every silence from you feels loaded.
Heavy. Punishing.
Empty in all the wrong ways.

And I’m grieving something no one else saw—
A friendship buried under the wreckage of a love that never got to live.
A bond that got sacrificed to fear and confusion and timing and everything you wouldn’t say.

You were my friend before you were anything else.
And losing that version of you—the one who wasn’t afraid to talk, to be, to care—
Hurts more than losing the version who claimed to love me.

I still carry the way you used to make me laugh. I still reminisce over all the little moments we had, working together for so many years. 
I still remember when you helped me move, when you made my sister food, the bug prank, how you shared half of your coffee with me - do you remember that? - the late night talks on the patio. Those little moments built trust and foundation. We showed up for each other when we were just friends. 
I still remember how good it felt to be near you before I was waiting on you.
Before I was hurting over you.
Before I was wondering if I even mattered anymore.

Maybe that version of you is gone for good.
Or maybe he’s still somewhere inside you, waiting for your courage to let him live again.

Either way—thank you.
For being real with me once.
Even if you couldn’t stay that way.
Even when my intensity made you retreat. 
I think we drove each other nuts. 
To even imagine someone could love either one of us like we love each other - man that’s scary. 
The fear drove us insane. 

I miss you.
But I’m learning to let go of who you were,
So I can finally stop hurting over what we became.

Does anyone know it?","There’s not really a place to ask about VIDEOS but i guess you could call this a audiobook? Each video had one story in it that was pretty long. Each had a creepy piece of art on the cover and I ate them up. This was years ago though, now i cant find it when I search for this channel.
More specifically this one story,

There was this boy who was living in this house after his sister dies. I think she went crazy or something then vanished but as the kid was staying over there, the sister pops up and is being weird. He heard weird noises at night and even at one point records where he sleep on the couch and finds the sister being weird and turning the camera off.
He had made friends with this detective at one point who was looking in on her case and the boy was texting him all this stuff about his sister while he finished up a case before hopping over to this little town. At one point the sister gets weird (The order is a bit fuzzy) so he runs away and hides in this coffee shop and waits for the detective to show up. You can tell this kid is scared or even a bit mental because he’s so anxious about EVERYTHING after the sister’s friend didn’t believe the boy.
Anyways, the detective calls the boy and the kid hears as the police try to stop the detective but then a speed chase goes on and he gets thrown off the road or something and dies. The boy runs on foot to his parent’s house who are both missing. He bunkers down but eventually leaves for whatever reason and gets chased by these two officers who stop him. The officers lead him into the woods and the boy starts hearing stuff in the trees so he breaks free and steals the police car before driving over to the cemetery.
He finds his sister’s grave still in good shape and brings out a shovel, determined to dig up this grave and see if she’s still down there. The sister comes up and talks to him and even tells him to kill her but he caves and they embrace. She convinces him that he’s just going crazy and needs help so the police men let him off free but by the end of it he’s locked in the basement which the comments said could symbolize that he was locked away in an asylum.

Cool right? Does anyone recognize this story? Or even a channel who makes stuff like this?

I am logging the new creation of a new anomaly by our corporation.

Z-2736 is a liquid that can sustain human life infinitely while in bloodstream, no other side effects have been seen.

Z-2736 is annoyingly hard to take out of the bloodstream, near impossible, even on drop can replicate into a gallon if unchecked.

Z-2736-A is a skinless human who was injected with Z-2736. The human should be dead, as all of their vital organs have been removed, excusing the brain and heart for now.

Z-2736-A is effectively immortal.

Now, we have use for this, but I believe I can manipulate Z-2736 into a subset of it, which I will mark Z-2736-B for now.

This subset should hopefully be able to heal Z-2736-A and fix their organs for me if I just lob them back in.

Sadly, I have to disclose some more boring details somewhere in this log, so I suppose the middle is a good place to hide it.

Due to Z-2736-A being human, I have to disclose their name.

Z-2736-A is Adam Poltzer. Alias: HQ.

Okay, back to science!

I can use this poison I found in my coffee as some extra chemicals to add to Z-2736 to create Z-2736-B.

Although, I believe Z-2736 has some healing effects naturally. I’ve noticed Z-2736-A has some regrowth of skin and internal organs despite no way to regenerate such matter.

I will investigate this further.

Good bye, Urbanshade!

I will see you soon.

We realized that the hotel we are staying at is maybe in a more corporate area (?), and we are open to driving places if it means we can check something good out. We plan to make it downtown for part of the weekend, so looking at spots anywhere in that area (I know, that's vague) in addition to Oak Brook/Oak Park.

**What we like**

* We have been to many of the major popular pizzerias (Giordano's, Pequod's, Low Malnati's, Aurelios, Gino's). We love pizza, and I would love to discover another spot!
* We also love tacos, and a few years ago went to a place in Wicker Park called Big Star that we really liked. I haven't done too much digging on other Mexican food in Chicago yet.
* We also love Thai, sushi, and Italian. We can pass on burgers, steakhouses, and breweries, unless there's something really special.
* I'd love to find some great breakfast/coffee spots.  I love coffee, pastries, and breakfast food. However, we haven't done a great job breaking out beyond chains in Chicago over the years (think Wildberry and Yolk) because we don't plan ahead and sleep in, lol. But, I'd love to visit something smaller and cozier.
* We are flexible on budget - we won't shy away from a special place that's expensive. 
* We try to avoid chains and super trendy TikTok places, or at least, that's our goal lol

**Our ""Itinerary"" So Far**

* We are driving up from Indianapolis on Friday, and are open to stopping pretty much anywhere in Chicago for an early dinner along the way up
* So far, the only thing we set in stone on the schedule is the Frank Lloyd Wright Home & Studio tour midday Saturday. So, any recommendations around Oak Brook or Oak Park for breakfast/lunch would be awesome for that
* I could see us heading downtown after the home tour for some shopping and doing dinner Saturday night, or any other neighborhoods, honestly, if it allows us to walk around and find ourselves at a place to eat. We've spent a lot of time in Wicker Park over the last few years and really like it, so other similar areas would be great
* Sunday, we will probably want to sleep in a little and check out a brunch spot before we drive back to Indy",0,1743129064.0,AskChicago,7,0.33,False

So I (27f) am an only child to my mom. So I feel like she is able to focus a lot of energy to me. She really wants me to go to my cousins wedding on her side and I personally don’t want to. For some background I have always felt excluded from that side of the family. My aunt would drive over an hour to see my cousin all the time but would never drive 2 hours for me. My mom and dad are divorced and my dad actually lived in the same city as my cousins. My uncle and aunt never reached out and never tried anything to see me when I was there. Mind you I was in an abusive situation with my dad. The whole family was aware but never reached out to tell me I’m not alone or to help me or anything. This all came to a head this thanksgiving when my aunt was making plans with the cousins that’s getting married wanting to get coffee and have a day together with her son too. I live 30 mins away and there was no offer extended. I know I could have asked but that’s not the kind of person I am inviting myself when I don’t even feel wanted. So I told my mom about these feelings and she was extremely neutral about this. Saying if I wanted to go just invite myself along, telling me she doesn’t know what she wants the outcome of this conversation to be and just to try more. I was also told that I’m the problem being stand offish. I did point out they never made an effort for any relationship with me so yes I may seem that way but I’m just uncomfortable and shy. These people know I will always talk to them and hold a conversation. The kicker was her telling me satan like making people feel this way and I should pray more. I’m of the belief that all deities exist I just don’t pray to any or worship any. She is very very Christian. So now it comes to the wedding. She “jokes” about dragging me there and me and my husband will be there. Do I go to keep the peace with my mom and slowly start disappearing from all of that side of the family or do I stand firm with a no thank you and deal with fall out? I’m sorry if this is just word vomiting but I don’t know I have always been a people pleaser and never stood up for myself with my family. But I think it’s time to start building a family that actually wants me and I’m excited to see. ",1,1743128711.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I have a reasonably specific question about nozzle wear and filament diameter.  Can I tell nozzle wear by measuring the diameter of purged filament?  I’ve had some dimensional accuracy and print in place issues, nothing serious, but more like hinges bonding together and some things not fitting sort of thing.  Was curious if a nozzle is worn out (Flash Forge Adventurer 3), and was changing filament colors and it made me wonder if I could just leave the filament harden so I could measure the purge thickness.  I measured 0.52mm and I mean, based on some of the stuff I’ve seen online that might not be all that bad lol, but with me just learning was hoping to eliminate any easy problems and seemed like maybe that could have been one.  Has anyone ever looked at this measurement in relation to a new nozzle, or is there any general rules of thumb on something likely this?  I don’t see the tell tale signs that I can see, plugs, failed prints etc, but I notice some inconsistencies that I’m not liking such as print in place not really working, but prints are still doing good. However I just printed my brother an adapter for his coffee grinder, and the adapter was too tight for his catch cup, so even there, it was a simple enough print and didn’t fit… somethings wrong and it’s a used printer with almost 2000 hours on it, not sure if it’s ever had a nozzle change or at least if I’m nearing the end of the second nozzles life span.

I'm currently 28, I've been in and out of therapy since I was 18. My first therapist opened me up to the concept of being abused, and that I had grown up with abusive behavior in my family. Ever since then I have been on a mission to, ""figure myself out"", so to speak. Healing the trauma, repairing what was done, and hopefully making it out on the other side, even through the grief, shame, and fear that came along with it.

I would say there are ways my mental state, my nervous system, is actually doing well, and I am in a much better state overall from where I was at not even 5 years ago. However, my biggest current problem is finding where to go next and what to do. Without revealing too much, I live in a small-ish town in Utah, I grew up Mormon, and am also gay. I lived my first 13 years in Sacramento California, then moved to where I am now, and have been living with my parents this whole time.

My biggest need, and I know this in theory, is that I need to move out, but that seems unfeasible with how I feel on a day to day basis. I think a lot of people are in the same space as I am in this sub, as I have read about how a lot of people are experiencing something very similar, and that is helpful to a degree, knowing that CPTSD is an all encompassing experience, where we can all relate to each other. However, that doesn't sort out the current situation I'm in. I feel too paralyzed to even move out of my bedroom door, let alone my whole house, where I am ""safe"" theoretically, but not safe in the ways that count completely.

I'm currently in therapy, but that doesn't get me where I would want to be, my dad is also paying for it, because I don't have a job, which I was hoping I would get a job, but realize now that unless I'm OK, I don't know if I can. I feel helpless in many ways, and have 0 clue on what to do, other than the obvious, which feel like too much for me. I also dissociate pretty awfully, it's hard for me to focus, and I don't know what to do about that either. My therapist is urging me to take steps forward, for example, do small things that would get me out of my room, something like going to a coffee shop, just being around people, where I can dip out at anytime, so if I feel overwhelmed I don't receive a heavier consequence, like a job. Am I just getting in my own way? These things feel nigh impossible.

I wanted to rant on here because I'm looking for a solution but also just to vent and have other people understand me, because even though I have been doing this ""healing"" thing for a while, there are roadblocks that I have felt that feel almost insurmountable.",1,1743128298.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

The alien ship bristled with weapon ports, sensor arrays, armored thrust nozzles and other, unknown technology. It kind of resembled a scarab, squat but round, grooves giving the ship the impression of a segmented body. It was big. Easily about 300 meters wide and 500 meters long, not including the antennae. It was obviously the command ship of the fleet, the rest of the 14 ships surrounding it a standard array of cruisers, destroyers and a pair of utility vessels. In all, it was an impressive battle group and carried more than enough firepower to glass a planet or wreck most any fleet of the galactic federation.

Captain Jon Cassilio of the *Munir Ali* stared at the viewscreen as the research vessel examined the Rayet ships. Her mission was to chart the Endas star system, soon to be renamed the Rayet system, as that is what the locals named their star. 

Jon’s XO Silas Abernathy sipped from his mug of coffee, watching the readings scroll across the screen. “First Contact, cap?”

“Not for them. There’s plasma scoring on a couple of the destroyer-class ships.”

Silas raised an eyebrow, “could be intra-species conflict?”

“Not likely. Their ships are armed with fusion warheads and masers. Also, see how the cruisers have disproportionally large thrusters? They’re hiding spinal-mount railguns inside them. It’s all ballistics and low-tier energy weapons. So plasma weapons are probably beyond them. No, they’ve already had First Contact, and it looks like it didn’t go well for whomever they encountered.”

Silas scowled. “So what do we do, Cap?”

Jon smiled wryly. “Why, we’re just a friendly research vessel full of scientists representing the Solarian Research Foundation, we just wanna be friends...”

\---

*“...young slave speaker begs forgive. Instruction sequence learns from labor.”*

Admiral Biniz glared at the speaker as it spat out a clearly automated voice and bellowed, “how did these *aliens* learn so much of our language?” Their shoulder spines wiggled in anger. 

Second Technician Mat bowed, avoiding eye contact. “It’s possible they have been able to pick up industrial transmissions. They could be using an advanced computation matrix.”

Biniz turned their gaze to the technician. “They learned our words in just a few cycles?”

“Very likely, sir. And their transmission is on a common frequency. Systemnet has probably picked it up and carried it back to the homeworld.”

“Good,” Biniz felt the hunter’s blood rise, “the homeworld will see us get the aliens to surrender instead of futile combat and destruction of their flimsy ship. I think I want this computation matrix.”

*“...Admiral Kibhiz Psaadh Biniz hai Thoxikh of the Rayet 1-stroke-3 fleet. Your ship and crew are now slaves under \[untranslatable\]. Surrender all \[untranslatable\] immediately or \[untranslatable\].”*

Silas frowned. “Well, that doesn’t seem particularly friendly.”

Jon grinned back. “I’ve never been a slave before.” 

Silas glared, suddenly more formal. “Captain, we should flee.”

Jon’s face sobered. “Silas, we’re hours from the jump point, even if we’re willing to burn out the reactors. While we can certainly keep out of range of their masers, and probably avoid or scramble their missile tracking, there’s no way we can avoid those railguns all the way to the jump point.” Jon locked eyes with Silas. “There are better options.”

Silas held Jon’s gaze, then relented. “Yes, Captain.”

Jon activated the comms. “Admiral Kibhiz Psaadh Biniz hai Thoxikh, I’m Captain Jon Cassilio…”

\---

Hours had passed for Cassilio as she and the crew of the *Munir Ali* were taken aboard the alien flagship. Their vessel was brought under tow by one of the flagship *Thoxikh*’s tender ships and the entire fleet turned back toward Rayet II. The interior of the *Thoxikh* had a distinctly ultraviolet hue, causing the Solarian uniforms to fluoresce. The lights caused Jon’s injuries to look even more discolored and horrific, her blood almost black. She was missing two teeth on the right side of her mouth, and she cradled her mangled left hand.

The translation program had been running overtime since they were brought aboard, working hard to both translate and update its own language patterns. The Rayet allowed the translation program to run through Cassilio’s datacom, impressed by the advanced Solarian computer system. Near-instant translation was too useful during interrogations.



Silas had also been interrogated roughly. His left hand had been entirely removed, and the way he held his ribs indicated some were probably broken. He wheezed as he spoke. “Cap-tain…”

Jon quietly looked over the rest of the crew. Most had suffered minor bruises from being pushed around by the hulking Rayet, but otherwise looked fine. However, only about two dozen were present. “Silas, where is everyone else?”

Silas looked away. Only one word wheezed out. “Dissection.”

Jon clenched her good fist, but only briefly. She sighed, then turned to address the remaining crew. “We have a decision to make, and it affects all of us. These Rayat are new on the galactic stage. They’re aggressive, smart, and expansionistic. They appear to have no empathy for other life, let alone sentients. They’re smart enough that even though we wiped our computers and rigged the reactors to blow should they try to start them up, they’ll probably get a significant technological jump from studying our ship.”

The crew nodded, their faces serious. Silas coughed wetly and spat reddish foam onto the floor, as if punctuating the Captain’s words.

“There is no escape. They’re a slaver empire and they’ve built these prisons with that in mind. We’re certainly being monitored now, and even without our translator running, they’re sure to have some idea what we’re talking about, so we don’t have much longer to talk. The question we need to decide, right now…” Captain Jon Cassilio’s expression became rock hard. “...is how much we’re willing to suffer before the end?”

The rest of the Solarians’ expressions turned just as grim and determined as the Captain’s.

\---

The Solarian jump point monitoring platform was well-hidden from any prying eyes - built for stealth and quietly holding station about 5 light-minutes from the jump point. Close enough to have excellent readouts of anything coming through while not intruding on the official Galactic Republic monitoring platforms. 

When the *Munir Ali’s* disaster buoy popped out of the jump point, it executed its instructions perfectly. In the wash of radiation that accompanied a jump transit, the buoy launched a stealth drone, practically invisible to the Republic’s sensors. The stealth drone turned, fired its thrusters and flew straight to the secret monitoring station. 

The disaster buoy was scooped up by the Republic platform, dutifully reporting a terrible accident that led to all hands lost. Reactor breaches were not unheard of, and when they occurred, there was rarely anything more than scattered atoms and radiation left over. It was why disaster buoys were invented in the first place.



While the Republic mourned the loss of a peaceful Solarian research vessel, the real message was delivered. A recording of the *Munir Ali’s* First Contact with the Rayet. A dangerous, aggressive new species that left unchecked, could bring the Republic to its knees. Sensor logs, translation matrices, technological readouts, and every excruciating second of the crew’s interrogation at the hands of the Rayet. It amounted to their epitaph, a recording of their sacrifice to gather every last piece of intelligence on the Rayet. An epitaph to be quietly filed away in the archives of the Solarian Research Foundation while they decided  what was to be done about the Rayet. An epitaph that would never be seen by the galaxy at large.",4,1743128135.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False

I’m a full believer in hormonal weight management now.,"I was told this 5 paragraph post was low effort but hopefully this sub enjoys it bc I wish more people knew how important the quality of calories you eat are. 

I'll start right to the point then break it down. I was not trying to do keto diet, but doctor directed cut sugars, increased fat, and focused on probiotic and fermented food to curb insulin levels and I lost 8lbs already. It is the fastest easiest weight loss I have ever experienced. I have a lot of busy energy, I feel younger, and I never feel hungry.

The last 2 days I have been making myself eat and the only thing I am craving is cold oats in heavy cream.

I say I'm not trying to do keto bc I'm not focused on cutting all carbs, just sugar. I'm still eating all vegetables, quinoa, rice, oatmeal, and sourdough bread. I'm also eating berries and bananas. But that was enough to put me in ketosis (I have strips to monitor ketones and insulin).

I am avoiding anything with added sugar, sugar alcohols, high in sugar, seed oils, and using ghee, butter, olive oil. I have been eating Greek yogurt with fruit or nuts, cottage cheese with berries, omelettes, bacon, chicken, quinoa, chick peas, vegetables, nuts, and drinking kombucha, green tea, and medium roast coffee (a big switch for me, I love dark roast).

I am flirting with pre-diabetes. I have a family history, am 40, overweight, fasted blood sugar around 100, and was getting uncontrollably tired after eating.

Just as yoga teaches us to find balance within ourselves, a successful marriage requires a synchronization of these facets to foster a deep bond. By nurturing this triad, couples can explore a profound intimacy that enriches their lives and fortifies their relationship.

The essence of a successful marriage lies in the ability to grow together, transcending the mundane and navigating life’s challenges as a cohesive unit. Emotional connections serve as the foundation for understanding and empathy, while physical interactions enhance attraction and reinforce a sense of safety and security. Furthermore, spiritual connections can elevate a partnership, allowing couples to share their innermost beliefs and aspirations, creating a sanctuary where both individuals feel valued and heard. Understanding how these elements intertwine is pivotal for couples seeking to deepen their bond.

In our fast-paced world, it’s easy for couples to neglect one or more of these dimensions inadvertently. However, recognizing and addressing these gaps is essential for maintaining a vibrant relationship. Exploring the interplay between marriage's physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects can provide couples with the tools they need to nurture their union. This blog post delves into the intricacies of these connections, offering insights and strategies for fostering a harmonious partnership.

As you read on, consider where you currently stand in your relationship. What areas are thriving, and which might need more attention? By the end of this article, you’ll better understand how to cultivate your union of mind, body, and spirit, ensuring a fulfilling marriage that stands the test of time.

**The Physical Connection: Growing Together Through Interaction**

The physical connection between couples is often the most visible aspect of their relationship. While it can encompass intimacy, it also includes the myriad ways partners express affection—holding hands, hugging, or simply sharing a comfortable silence on the couch. According to renowned relationship expert [Dr. John Gottman](https://www.gottman.com), “The quality of your connection is paramount,” emphasizing that physical closeness fosters emotional security and a sense of belonging.

Engaging in physical activities together can strengthen this bond. Whether it’s going for walks, dancing, or practicing yoga, shared experiences can create joyful memories that enhance the relationship. Activities that require teamwork, such as [hiking](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-benefits-of-hiking-for-mental-health-5197254) or playing a sport, promote collaboration and increase feelings of togetherness. They improve physical health and encourage couples to communicate and support each other, reinforcing their emotional connection.

Additionally, the practice of touch is essential. Research has shown that physical touch releases [oxytocin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001006/), often referred to as the “love hormone.” This hormone fosters feelings of closeness and trust, making it vital for couples to prioritize physical affection. Even simple gestures like a gentle touch on the arm or a warm embrace can significantly impact the emotional landscape of a relationship.

However, it's crucial to remember that physical connection is not solely about sexual intimacy. Exploring each other's preferences and comfort levels can lead to a deeper understanding of one another. Couples should communicate openly about their needs and desires, ensuring that both partners feel valued in the relationship. By doing so, they can cultivate a nurturing environment that allows their love to flourish.

**The Emotional Connection: Building Empathy and Understanding**

Emotional intimacy is the cornerstone of a resilient marriage. It involves sharing thoughts, feelings, and experiences to foster understanding and empathy. Couples who prioritize emotional connections often report higher levels of satisfaction and stability in their relationships. As [Dr. Sue Johnson](https://drsuejohnson.com), a leading expert in emotional bonding, states, “The key to a lasting relationship is emotional responsiveness.” This responsiveness involves being attuned to each other's emotional states and providing support during challenging times.

Effective communication plays a pivotal role in enhancing emotional intimacy. Couples should strive to engage in open dialogues, honestly expressing their thoughts and feelings. This practice strengthens the bond and helps partners navigate conflicts more effectively. When both individuals feel heard and validated, they are more likely to work together to resolve issues, fostering a sense of teamwork.

Another important aspect of emotional connection is vulnerability. Sharing fears, insecurities, and dreams can create a profound sense of closeness. When one partner opens up, the other can respond with compassion and understanding, deepening their bond. This mutual vulnerability lays the groundwork for a safe space where both individuals can grow and evolve together.

Additionally, practicing gratitude can significantly enhance emotional intimacy. Regularly expressing appreciation for one another helps couples focus on the positive aspects of their relationship. As [Dr. Robert Emmons](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_is_gratitude), a leading researcher in gratitude, notes, “Gratitude is the single most important ingredient to a successful marriage.” By acknowledging and celebrating each other’s contributions, couples can cultivate a resilient emotional connection that withstands the test of time.

**The Spiritual Connection: Exploring Shared Beliefs and Values**

While physical and emotional connections are vital, the spiritual aspect of a relationship often provides the deepest level of intimacy. A shared spiritual journey can enhance a couple's connection, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. Spirituality might encompass religious beliefs, personal values, or a shared sense of connection to something greater than oneself.

Couples can strengthen their spiritual bond by engaging in shared practices, such as [meditation](https://www.meditationoasis.com/), prayer, or attending spiritual gatherings together. These activities allow partners to explore their beliefs and values, creating a deeper understanding of what truly matters to everyone. As spiritual teacher [Eckhart Tolle](https://eckharttolle.com), said, “The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it.” Couples can navigate life's challenges with grace and unity by cultivating positive thoughts and intentions.

Moreover, discussing individual beliefs and aspirations can help partners align their values. This alignment fosters a sense of shared purpose, enabling couples to support each other in their personal growth journeys. When both individuals feel free to express their beliefs, they create a nurturing environment where spiritual intimacy can thrive.

Spirituality also encourages gratitude and mindfulness, which can significantly enhance the quality of a relationship. Practicing mindfulness together enables couples to be present in the moment, deepening their appreciation for each other. As [Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://www.mindfulnesscds.com/), a pioneer in mindfulness, notes, “Mindfulness is the awareness that arises from paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment.” This awareness can lead to greater emotional regulation and improved communication, further strengthening the relationship.

**Addressing Diminished Connections: Recognizing and Rectifying Issues**

While the journey of marriage can be fulfilling, it is not without challenges. Couples may encounter difficulties when one or more aspects of their connection—physical, emotional, or spiritual—become diminished. Recognizing and taking proactive steps to address these shifts is essential for maintaining a healthy relationship.

When physical intimacy wanes, partners may feel disconnected or undervalued. Communicating openly about needs and desires is crucial, ensuring both partners feel comfortable expressing their feelings. Seeking professional guidance, such as [couples therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4598480/), can also provide valuable tools for navigating these challenges and reigniting physical closeness.

Emotional disconnection often manifests as misunderstandings or unresolved conflicts. Couples should prioritize regular check-ins to discuss their feelings and concerns. By creating a safe space for dialogue, partners can work through issues together, reinforcing their emotional bond. As relationship expert [Dr. Helen Fisher](https://www.helencfisher.com) advises, “Communicate in a way that fosters understanding rather than defensiveness.”

Spiritual disconnection can lead to feelings of isolation or lack of purpose. Couples should explore their beliefs and aspirations together, engaging in activities that foster spiritual growth. This could include volunteering, attending workshops, or simply discussing their values and goals. By aligning their spiritual journeys, partners can cultivate a deeper sense of connection and purpose.

To maintain a strong relationship, consider these five strategies:

1.     **Prioritize Communication**: Regularly discuss feelings, needs, and concerns to foster understanding.

2.     **Engage in Shared Activities**: Participate in physical, emotional, and spiritual activities that bring you closer together.

3.     **Practice Gratitude**: Acknowledge and appreciate each other's contributions to the relationship.

4.     **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consider couples therapy or workshops to strengthen your bond and address any challenges.

5.     **Be Open to Change**: Recognize that relationships evolve; be willing to adapt and grow together.

**Five Practices for a Healthy, Lifelong Union**

Creating a healthy, lifelong marriage requires ongoing effort and commitment. Here are five practices that couples can incorporate into their daily lives to keep their relationship vibrant:

**1. Establish Rituals**

Creating meaningful rituals can significantly enhance the emotional connection between partners. These rituals foster intimacy and provide opportunities for couples to reconnect amidst their busy lives. For instance, establishing a regular date night allows couples to prioritize quality time together. This time spent away from daily responsibilities can rekindle romance and strengthen the bond.

Furthermore, rituals can extend beyond date nights. Morning coffee together, evening walks, or shared hobbies can create a sense of togetherness. These small, consistent moments build a rhythm in a relationship, offering stability and comfort. As [Dr. John Gottman](https://www.gottman.com) suggests, creating shared rituals can help couples maintain a strong emotional connection over time.

Incorporating rituals also provides a platform for couples to celebrate milestones and achievements together. Whether it's commemorating anniversaries, personal achievements, or simply acknowledging a tough week, these moments of celebration reinforce the idea that partners are in it together. This sense of partnership enhances emotional intimacy and reminds couples of their shared journey, deepening the commitment to one another.

**2. Cultivate Individual Growth**

Encouraging each other's personal development is crucial for a healthy marriage. When partners support one another in pursuing individual passions and interests, they grow as individuals and as a couple. This growth can lead to a more enriched relationship, as each partner brings new experiences and perspectives into the partnership.

For example, suppose one partner is interested in taking a cooking class. In that case, the other can support this endeavor by attending classes together or simply encouraging their partner to pursue this interest. These actions demonstrate a commitment to each other’s happiness and fulfillment. As [Dr. Helen Fisher](https://www.helencfisher.com) points out, supporting each other's individual pursuits fosters a deeper emotional connection, as both partners feel valued for who they are outside of the marriage.

Additionally, cultivating individual growth can lead to healthier boundaries within the relationship. Each partner should have the freedom to explore their interests, which can prevent feelings of resentment or stagnation. Encouraging individual pursuits can also foster conversations about new ideas and experiences, enriching the overall relationship and keeping it dynamic.

Lastly, celebrating each other’s achievements—no matter how small—can create a positive feedback loop that encourages continued growth. By acknowledging and cheering each other on, couples reinforce their commitment to personal development and create an environment where both partners feel inspired to thrive.

**3. Practice Mindfulness**

Incorporating mindfulness practices into your daily routine can significantly enhance emotional connection and relationship satisfaction. Mindfulness encourages partners to be present in the moment, allowing them to appreciate each other's company fully. Simple exercises, such as mindful breathing or meditation, can help couples cultivate awareness of their thoughts and feelings, leading to deeper emotional understanding.

Engaging in mindfulness together can also serve as a bonding activity. Couples can set aside time each week to practice meditation or even go for mindful walks in nature. These shared activities not only promote relaxation but also encourage open dialogue about feelings and experiences. As [Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://www.mindfulnesscds.com) emphasizes, mindfulness helps to foster emotional regulation, making it easier for couples to navigate challenges without escalating conflicts.

Moreover, practicing mindfulness can enhance empathy between partners. As couples become more attuned to their emotions, they can better understand each other's feelings and respond compassionately. This heightened awareness can lead to more meaningful conversations and a stronger emotional bond.

Finally, the practice of gratitude, a key component of mindfulness, can significantly impact relationship quality. Couples who regularly express appreciation for each other are more likely to maintain a positive outlook on their relationship. This gratitude can be integrated into mindfulness practices, such as sharing three things they appreciate about each other during their mindfulness sessions, further deepening their connection.

**4. Engage in Continuous Learning**

Continuous learning together not only strengthens a couple's bond but also fosters intellectual and emotional growth. This can take many forms—attending workshops, reading books, or taking classes. Engaging in these activities allows couples to share new ideas and perspectives, enhancing their understanding of each other and the world around them.

For instance, attending a workshop on communication skills can equip couples with tools to navigate conflicts more effectively. Similarly, reading a relationship-focused book together can spark discussions that deepen their emotional connection. These shared learning experiences provide valuable insights and create a sense of teamwork as both partners work together toward mutual growth.

Additionally, continuous learning can reignite the spark in a long-term relationship. Exploring new topics or skills together can bring excitement and novelty, breaking the routine of everyday life. As [Dr. John Gottman](https://www.gottman.com) suggests, engaging in shared learning experiences can create shared narratives that enhance the emotional bond between partners.

Finally, embracing the mindset of lifelong learning fosters resilience in a relationship. Couples who prioritize growth are more likely to adapt to changes and challenges, viewing them as opportunities for improvement rather than threats to their relationship. This adaptability can lead to a stronger, more fulfilling partnership over time.

**5. Celebrate Milestones**

Celebrating milestones in a relationship is vital for reinforcing the bond between partners. Acknowledging significant moments—such as anniversaries, achievements, or even overcoming challenges—reminds couples of their shared journey. These celebrations create lasting memories and foster a sense of gratitude for the partnership.

One effective way to celebrate milestones is to establish traditions. For example, couples can create a ritual around their anniversary, such as revisiting their first date's location or writing letters about their experiences over the past year. These rituals mark the occasion and allow couples to reflect on their growth together.

Additionally, celebrating small victories can also be impactful. Acknowledging achievements like completing a project, overcoming a personal challenge, or even supporting each other through tough times fosters a sense of teamwork and unity. As [Dr. Robert Emmons](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_is_gratitude) emphasizes, expressing gratitude for each other’s contributions strengthens emotional connections.

Finally, sharing these celebrations with friends and family can further enhance the bond between partners. By inviting loved ones to partake in the celebrations, couples can create a supportive community that reinforces their connection. This communal support can be a powerful reminder of the commitment and love shared between partners, fostering a deeper sense of belonging.

**Conclusion: The Journey of Unity**

The yoga of marriage invites couples to explore the intricate connections that bind them together. By nurturing their relationship's physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects, partners can create a profound bond that withstands the test of time. Recognizing the importance of connection and actively working to strengthen these dimensions can lead to a more harmonious, fulfilling union.

As you reflect on your relationship, consider where to implement some of the strategies discussed. What practices resonate with you? Where can you prioritize connection in your daily life? You can cultivate a loving partnership that thrives on mutual growth, respect, and understanding by taking intentional steps.

What do you think? Where are you in your current relationship? What must you work on to strengthen your mind, body, and spirit union?

 

**Prayer for Lasting Love and Connection**

Divine and loving Spirit,  
We gather in gratitude for the gift of love and the bond shared between couples. May this relationship be a sanctuary of understanding, respect, and joy. Guide each partner to nurture the connection they hold, allowing love to flourish in every moment.

Help them to communicate openly, sharing their thoughts and feelings with honesty and compassion. May they always listen with open hearts, fostering a deep emotional connection that strengthens their union.

As they walk through life together, grant them the wisdom to embrace change and growth. Let their love be a source of support during challenges and a celebration during joyful times. May they find strength in each other and always remember the beauty of their shared journey.

Bless their moments of togetherness with warmth, laughter, and affection. May they cherish the little things that bring joy and create lasting memories that enrich their lives.

In times of struggle, remind them of the love that brought them together. Help them to resolve conflicts with grace and understanding, always returning to the foundation of their commitment.

May their love reflect your divine presence, radiating peace and harmony to those around them. Let their relationship inspire others to seek connection and understanding in their own lives.

With gratitude, we offer this prayer for enduring love, deepening bonds, and a relationship that grows stronger with each passing day. Amen.

My boyfriend and I missed out on the cherry blossoms in Dallas last year when we took off the first week of April for his birthday. From what I've read  cherry blossoms trees typically bloom later farther north, so we figured we'd take the first week of April off again and check out the Missouri Botanical garden. 
I've seen on Instagram that they're already experiencing blooms so I fear we might have missed our chance again. :/ The loose plans are to stay at a cabin located about an hour outside of the city for two nights. Spend the first afternoon/evening chilling at the cabin, and then exploring the Botanical gardens and maybe grabbing some lunch before returning to the cabin for another night and then heading home the next morning. It's a decent drive (5 hours, so a bit shorter than our Dallas trip) but if the blooms will have all fallen we'll probably save money and do more of a staycation. 
Also, if you have any recommendations for local spots that would be great! Even if we don't end up going this year, I'd love to know for future reference.

Family cat is being much more lazy this past week or so. Seems to be getting more lazy each day. He just from what i see lays down mostly in one spot all day. He is overweight too but wasnt lazy like this before. If food was opened he would jump straight up on the counter but now wont. Only goes down on the floor for the food the past day or two. I did try to put him on the counter and he seemed to stuglle a little getting down and just acted weird and stood there for a minute 2hen he jumped down then went back to kay down. He also did clunk his head on the coffee table underneath while trying to jump onto the couch a week ago. He has since we got him gone under the couch hiding sometimes but the other cats do that too. He also has bloody stool i think as a kitten or around 1 but waa tested and they found no blood. I have checked it here and there since but havnt seen anything in it but its hard to tell. We also had a kitten have parasites a few months ago but the kitten was quarantined. The kitten has had a sneeze since we got her but the vet said tests showed nothing wrong and also got retested to make sure parasites are gone. The lathargic cat has spent a lotbof time at the door of the quatentined kitten and the vet said it was ok for them to see each other as long as the pets were not near the litter box so they did see eachother for a little supervised while quarantined. The dog did get to the litter box once and was tested but no worms. Now im worried some cross contamination happened. What are the main things that could be wrong and what should we ask the vet to test for? If there are worms would i see them in the poop? I believe the kitten had tape or round worms. Would the vet test for everything a cough or sneeze could be with the kitten? They also seem to eat eachothers food (kitten, cat, small dog. Thats plobably the main thing i though is the problem because its only been a few weeks since the kitten food was in reach for the cats and i think also around the time the dog starting getting soft food in its diet which tge cat has ate. How dangerous is cross feeding? Not sure how much ir hiw often. he also been carrying around a cat toy, not sure if i seen him do that before. They all got flea meds a few weeks or months ago.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes.

I had no plans and continue not to have plans of joining the church. They brought me in and introduced themselves to me and we (me and about 15 others) all went into a room and everyone was kind and polite and we read maroni chapter 7 for an hour with people stopping and talking about what was read. After the study I asked my questions which included but were not limited to (I will include the answers I was given (not verbatim)) why are hot drinks like coffee and tea allowed: because caffeine is not allowed. I then asked if caffeine is forbidden then why do you eat chocolate and drink soda and why is hot chocolate allowed as a hot drink with caffeine: because of health reasons and to keep us from getting addicted to caffeine. I then asked if Jesus visited the Americas why is there no record or folk tale or any documentation that anyone like Jesus the son of God in native culture: because it was a long time ago and they wouldn’t have record of something from that long ago. Next I asked if everyone could agree Jesus was without sin and everyone agreed, I continued that with asking why alcohol is a sin when Jesus himself drank it: Wine back then didn’t actually get you drunk and people drank it because clean water was hard to come by. I countered with the fact there are stories such as Noah getting drunk after the flood cleared when he planted vineyards: I actually didn’t know that happened in the Bible but i don’t have an answer for that question. Next I asked about when we die we go to heaven and live eternity with God but how can we do that if when we die we get our own planet and our own heaven above for ourselves to rule and to add on to that does that mean our God was a regular person who had his or her own life as a human and was there a Joseph smith on that planet and if you go all the way back following that chain who is the original God: we don’t actually know how to answer that and we’ve never thought about that but we can look into it for you.

Need advice?,"I need to know if I am overreacting for what could just be a rough patch or if something more serious needs to be done. This will be long, sorry in advance…

I 26/F have been with husband 26/M for 8 years now, we started dating just as we graduated from high school. He came from a pretty poor family in terms of financial stability and also the way his family poorly treats one another… the complete opposite of my family. But, for example; the way men speak and treat woman in his family, which I didn’t discover/realize until later down the road :/ 

In the beginning he was ambitious, had goals, was responsible in all ways, including financially, and was also an outgoing person. Years go by, everything is good… I notice some things here and there but nothing too concerning, or maybe I was just blindsided. Anyways, we get engaged, married and here we are now. One major thing I noticed was that he was not involved in our wedding planning at all, I did absolutely everything and did not get his help with anything once. I brushed it off stupidly thinking “oh guys don’t care about things like this, I don’t want to pester him with all these girly wedding things” etc… 

He also slowly became lazier; didn’t want to walk the dog anymore, going out became a chore for him, and if I managed to drag him out whether just us two, or with friends/family then oh boy would I hear the nagging and complaining whole time we were out or back at home. He slowly started becoming less determined in life and I noticed he was doing less and less, I always have to tell him what needs to be done, like taking out the trash, or even that he’s due for a hair cut… he never initiates anything himself or thinks of things himself. So with that being said, little romantic surprises or compliments are completely none existent. 

Then, there have been issues of still treating our finances separately (ie, going grocery shopping together but paying separately like weirdos because he refuses to put money in and use our joint account) sure I get it, a joint account doesn’t work for everybody, but as a married couple splitting everything down the middle or saying I need to pay him back for items is just straight up weird and not how I want my relationship to be. I’ve always brushed this off as him just growing up poor and needing to hoard money/resources to himself…

A few more things have happened over the years here and there, but most recently, he is on a temporary lay off with his job at the moment, so I have been doing everything while he just lays around the house all day. I still do everything when I get home in terms of cleaning, chores, errands and making dinner etc… the other day I went to make some coffee right before I had to leave for work, because I was too busy preparing for the day ahead, taking care of our dog, getting everything ready… and he flips his shit. Calling me an idiot and stupid for “needing to make a coffee at the same time as him” and leaves the house, slamming the door after him. This man has the entire day to make himself some coffee, or could make it once I left, or even better; offer to make it for me because I am literally doing everything else in the morning while he lays there on his phone. The following day I asked him a simple and polite question if he had heard anything from his boss and has any word for he will be going back to work. He flips his shit at me again, screaming and calling me a  c u n t, tells me I am annoying and that if he could get a divorce tomorrow, he would. He then storms out the house. I also cannot recall a single time he has ever said “I’m sorry” in our relationship, not even once. It’s quite pathetic and frustrating honestly. 

Now I don’t know if this is because of extreme stress and frustration due to this temporary lay off since this has never happened before, but he also lost his brother in January and his mother’s health isn’t the best right now either. 

The more I think about it everyday, the more I think that maybe we have just grown up and want different things in life now, especially since we started dating when we were as young as 17. Also, throughout the years we have been together, I recall certain red flags with name calling in the past, as well as catching him chatting with those kind of twitch streamers who make adult videos among other things. 

I don’t know if my eyes are just more open now and want different things in life or if this is just a rough patch with everything else going on, but I feel like the answer is obvious. It’s just hard because we are married, we own things together, have our vehicles co-signed with each other, the last name change and all that :/ 

I honestly just feel so lost :(

I am 22 years old and live in Iowa. I am a non-denominational Christian. For most of my life I was a lukewarm Christian, I went to Church with my family but I didn't live a Godly life. A couple months ago I felt the Lord calling on my heart to follow him and he has changed my life. I was baptized in early March, I've felt God change me as a person and I can't wait to see what he has prepared for me!

For a first date I'm good with getting coffee at some point in person. I love studying human biology and learning about how the body functions. It has made me appreciate how incredible life really is. A little bit about me is I love to watch movies, especially oldies. I'm 6'0"" and have a slender frame, I also have brown hair and blue eyes. 😉 My favorite film of all time is ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I watch it every year. I go jogging all the time out in the corn fields. Occasionally, I play video games like Minecraft and The Sims. I'd love to have game nights or movie nights, or best of all, both!

When God saved me, I realized my calling was to pursue a career in the medical field. I have given my life to Jesus Christ. I want to get to a point where I read the Bible every day and think about what God wants of me before I act. I'm looking for someone who wants to build a relationship through Jesus. I want someone who loves to spend time in the word. I'm up for someone between the ages of 18 and 26, and I hope to have children one day!

When it comes to a long-distance relationship, I wouldn't be able to wait for several years before living near each other. I'd need someone currently living in Iowa or in a nearby close state. Alternatively, if you are at a point where you'd be willing to move after a year or longer of dating, I'd love to get to know you. I'd really like to be able to relocate myself however I'm unable to while pursuing my career due to the cost associated and the programs located in my home state.

Ugh where do I even start....

My name is Thomas, Tommy for short, I'm a single dad just trying to make everyday The best it can be for Lila. I'm 32 and Lila's 11, it hasn't always been the easiest for us both but I always try to let her see the beautiful side of life rather than the stress. Her mom left when she was 2. one morning she was getting ready to go work at her job as a cna grabbed her coffee and her keys and walked out the door...then she never came home that night. There was no note, no warning, nothing. Lila would sometimes ask where she was or where she went I didn't know what to tell her. I would just say she's out saving the world. Maybe when she's older she'll understand till then I just try to keep a smile on her face 

I'm working at home as a customer service representative and also a music producer on the side
So we're doing alright for ourselves. Lila's been talking my ear off about how she wants to join gymnastics and all her friends really wanted her to join. We had a little extra pocket change so I went ahead and signed her up. She was so excited, she didn't stop talking about it all night long, I always love seeing her so passionate in things that she loves.

It's been a couple of months since she's been in gymnastics and I gotta admit I love seeing her be so engaged and active but sometimes it scares the hell out of me watching her do all those flips and walk the tight beam Maybe it's just the dad in me but every time she falls down or messes up she doesn't cry, or throw a fit , she gets up dusts her self off takes a deep breath and tries again. I'm proud of her for that.

Usually when I have the day off and Lila doesn't have gymnastics to go to I'm usually in the studio making my music. Sometimes Lila's in her room playing fortnight or Minecraft with her friends but every once in a while she'll come downstairs into the studio and hop on my drum set I have in the corner she's getting really good at it too. Our favorite band is Metallica, her favorite song to play is seek and destroy 

 One  day I'm sitting watching Lila practice her gymnastics routine for competition. All of a sudden my phone buzzed, I looked down so see what it was.it was an unknown number that read

""I know I messed up I just want to see her- Alice""

I (26 F) have been with husband (26M) for 8 years now, we started dating just as we graduated from high school. He came from a pretty poor family in terms of financial stability and also the way his family poorly treats one another… the complete opposite of my family. But, for example; the way men speak and treat woman in his family, which I didn’t discover/realize until later down the road :/ 

In the beginning he was ambitious, had goals, was responsible in all ways, including financially, and was also an outgoing person. Years go by, everything is good… I notice some things here and there but nothing too concerning, or maybe I was just blindsided. Anyways, we get engaged, married and here we are now. One major thing I noticed was that he was not involved in our wedding planning at all, I did absolutely everything and did not get his help with anything once. I brushed it off stupidly thinking “oh guys don’t care about things like this, I don’t want to pester him with all these girly wedding things” etc… 

He also slowly became lazier; didn’t want to walk the dog anymore, going out became a chore for him, and if I managed to drag him out whether just us two, or with friends/family then oh boy would I hear the nagging and complaining whole time we were out or back at home. He slowly started becoming less determined in life and I noticed he was doing less and less, I always have to tell him what needs to be done, like taking out the trash, or even that he’s due for a hair cut… he never initiates anything himself or thinks of things himself. So with that being said, little romantic surprises or compliments are completely none existent. 

Then, there have been issues of still treating our finances separately (ie, going grocery shopping together but paying separately like weirdos because he refuses to put money in and use our joint account) sure I get it, a joint account doesn’t work for everybody, but as a married couple splitting everything down the middle or saying I need to pay him back for items is just straight up weird and not how I want my relationship to be. I’ve always brushed this off as him just growing up poor and needing to hoard money/resources to himself…

A few more things have happened over the years here and there, but most recently, he is on a temporary lay off with his job at the moment, so I have been doing everything while he just lays around the house all day. I still do everything when I get home in terms of cleaning, chores, errands and making dinner etc… the other day I went to make some coffee right before I had to leave for work, because I was too busy preparing for the day ahead, taking care of our dog, getting everything ready… and he flips his shit. Calling me an idiot and stupid for “needing to make a coffee at the same time as him” and leaves the house, slamming the door after him. This man has the entire day to make himself some coffee, or could make it once I left, or even better; offer to make it for me because I am literally doing everything else in the morning while he lays there on his phone. The following day I asked him a simple and polite question if he had heard anything from his boss and has any word for he will be going back to work. He flips his shit at me again, screaming and calling me a  c u n t, tells me I am annoying and that if he could get a divorce tomorrow, he would. He then storms out the house. I also cannot recall a single time he has ever said “I’m sorry” in our relationship, not even once. It’s quite pathetic and frustrating honestly. 

Now I don’t know if this is because of extreme stress and frustration due to this temporary lay off since this has never happened before, but he also lost his brother in January and his mother’s health isn’t the best right now either. 

The more I think about it everyday, the more I think that maybe we have just grown up and want different things in life now, especially since we started dating when we were as young as 17. Also, throughout the years we have been together, I recall certain red flags with name calling in the past, as well as catching him chatting with those kind of twitch streamers who make adult videos among other things. 

I don’t know if my eyes are just more open now and want different things in life or if this is just a rough patch with everything else going on, but I feel like the answer is obvious. It’s just hard because we are married, we own things together, have our vehicles co-signed with each other, the last name change and all that :/ 

I honestly just feel so lost :(

1jlj9ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1jlj9ti/what_makes_a_wedding_formal/,What makes a wedding formal?,"Hi! I saw a TikTok where someone said your wedding needs to be formal enough to justify formal /black tie optional and above attire. To me, that totally makes sense! You don’t want guests to be dressed in tuxes for a barn wedding. 

But what else makes a wedding formal? What would a formal wedding have that justifies the dress code for you?


For background I’m having a wedding in the backyard of a very very nice house. All the men in bridal party will be in tuxes and bridesmaid / mothers in gowns. But since it’s a house affair I want to make sure to add formality in other ways. 

Edit:

Adding details since I guess formality can be measured by fitting a checklist

* venue is a modern style large house with a pool in the backyard and on the water 
* <100 guests
* valet parking
* begins at 4pm
* cocktail hour has 8 passed apps and a string quartet
* dinner is plated with table side service for side dishes
* live band during dinner and until 9:30
* dj from 9:30 onwards
* coffee cart and passed apps at 10pm 
* ceremony will be on grass
* liquor we’ll buy from Costco tbh and I don’t really even know what top shelf liquor is. None of our guests except maybe a couple of FIL’s friends are major drinkers. We’ll just get whatever our parents decide is best when we hit up Costco the week of. ",4,1743124312.0,weddingplanning,20,0.75,False

1jlj8wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jlj8wy/upgrading_from_bbe_after_close_to_a_decade_boots/,Upgrading from BBE after close to a decade. Boots Theory plus Pareto Principle application. Probably much less than [$6000],"Alright, I’ve spent a couple days reading through posts and I could use some advice.

First up, budget. I don’t really have one. With that being said, I’m trying to retire at 45, not 65. I’d like to apply the Pareto Principle to this purchase along with Boots Theory.

I bought a BBE something like a decade ago on a whim and have just kind of been using for close to a decade. The coffee is never as good as the shop, but it’s okay. It got me through the Covid years, and for that, I have had a bit of a soft spot for it. It’s dying though. The little arms for the portafilter under the grinder are dying, the grinder itself is struggling, and it’s taking a weirdly long time to heat up. It is time.

Anyway, I drink a milk drink in the morning and then experiment in the afternoon. Iced drinks in the summer, hot ones in the winter. My wife makes iced americanos every night for the next day. We host Thanksgiving and Christmas and end up making affogatos for 10 ish people twice a year, plus 4-6 people back to back maybe once a month. We’ve really squeezed the BBE for what it’s worth.

So, now I’m looking to replace it.

**Grinders**

I like the aesthetics of the Philos/Zerno/Timemore grinders. I realize these are very different price point machines. My concern is longevity and taste more than anything. Honestly, I am leaning toward the Philos, but I hate that the knob is on the back. My wife is short and will have trouble with it. She’s not super interested, but does want to be able to pull a shot still.

I am pretty good about not getting upgradeitis. I literally wear an 8 year old pair of Redwings boots almost every day and buy the same exact pair of jeans every six months, keeping 4 pairs in rotation. Which one of these is going to make 3 good coffees a day for the next decade without overpaying for “commercial” features that I don’t need?

**Espresso Machine**

I like the look of E61 machines and I also would like to be able to plumb my machine in. The fact that I could also take the resivoir right off makes the Bianca look like a great option. However, the long warmup time kind of sucks. I know we can put it on a timer and all that, but I do like the convenience of the thermoblock in the BBE. From there I started looking at the Micra. It warms up faster and I can plumb it in. However, I’m not as crazy about its looks. Then there’s the Mara. I realize that it’s even slower than the Bianca, but if I’m already waiting for 20 minutes, what’s 25 for half the price of the Micra? I know I can’t plumb it in, but I have made it close to a decade with just having my machine close enough to the sink that I can fill with the sprayer. There’s also the Profitec Pro 600 that looks interesting for being e61 and 10 minutes to heat up for a little more, but no direct plumbing.

Again, I’m looking for something that will make a good shot, will steam milk well (the BBE sucked at this), and will last until heat death of the universe. I’m not worried about upgradeitis. I just don’t know where the sweet spot is where I can have something that does what I want without paying for extra features that I don’t need. I’m leaning toward the Bianca because I can take the resivoir off and plumb it in as well as it being attractive, but am very open to other ideas. I just know I don’t want a lever for certain.

For both, I know that I don’t want an app. It can have one, but I want to be able to do everything (or close to it) without one. I will never analyze particle size, and I will almost never have just an espresso by itself (unless I can get on par with what I had in Italy at cafes). 

I guess what I’m trying to find is a setup that is good looking, will last a long time, will make a good shot quickly, and can steam milk well at the lowest price point where someone who spent nearly a decade with a BBE isn’t going to notice the difference between the new setup and a small town cafe. I know there is a diminishing returns line somewhere. I want to be maybe at the 90% mark instead of the 80% mark and to stay at that spot for at least 10 years, but am not interested in an extra $1,000 for 1% better or something like that.

Last week, I read a study \[\^1\] about long COVID in China. It said many Chinese people there have long-term symptoms, though I haven’t met anyone with issues like mine.  Today, I thought of using social media data to check the long COVID trend. I found a tool called [算数指数-巨量算数](https://trendinsight.oceanengine.com/arithmetic-index/analysis?keyword=%25E8%2580%25B3%25E9%25B8%25A3%252C%25E7%2596%25B2%25E6%2583%25AB%252C%25E6%25B7%258B%25E5%25B7%25B4%25E7%25BB%2593%25E8%2582%25BF%25E5%25A4%25A7%252C%25E6%25B2%25A1%25E7%25B2%25BE%25E7%25A5%259E%252C%25E7%2584%25A6%25E8%2599%2591&tab=heat_index&appName=aweme), which works like Google Trends for Douyin (China’s TikTok) and Toutiao (a popular news app). It shows search and content trends for keywords.

# Result

I used this tool to search keywords from 2019/01/01 to 2025/02/28, covering pre- and post-pandemic periods. The data shows a huge spike in searches for long COVID symptoms after December 7, 2022—the day China ended its Zero COVID policy. Most Chinese people got infected around then.

# My thoughts

Although there are some limitations of those data, it still provides a good insight into the situation of Long COVID in China: IT'S HAPPENING NOW. People need to be aware there is a thing called long COVID. I believe I'm not the only one who has gone to the hospital numerous times to find out what is happening with my body, and the answer I got from the doctor is something like anxiety, too much stress at work, or ""YOU ARE FINE"".  Many people are struggling and don't know what is happening to them. People need to know there is a thing called long COVID.

Rant/ Advice,"I'm at a horrible retail job until something better opens up. Found out I am not allowed to restrict access in any way to the restroom. Coworkers are expected to be able to use it regardless of how bad it is or what stage I'm at, stand in the way until I answer, or barge through and just do their thing with cleaners wasted. Regardless of how they treat me I am to leave until they're done. No signage is allowed. I am not allowed to mark my presence in any way, as the mop bucket let's them know I'm in either the mens or womens room. I was told I was violating rights when I wanted to leave a half hour window at the start of the shift for anyone to use the restroom, hoping to clean uninterrupted from morning coffee rushes. Doesn't matter when I have a 35 min job total turn into a 55 min job with all the people coming in and out, and that I was being dramatic worrying about being framed for wasting time after a store wide meeting which included stealing from the company (including elongated bathroom breaks!). 

So what happened this Monday? A coworker clocks me with the wood door as I was mopping, he came in early, was stressed and just rammed open the door to a soft thud and me frozen. Had minor bruising up and down my arm and hip. Store Director laughed when I asked what we could do to mitigate this, aw was it that bad I needed an incident report...?. She rehashed why I'm not allowed to let people know I'm cleaning (because they could have medical conditions, we can't ask, just let them use it, stop controlling people), or even what restroom I'm in so they don't have to ask. It was angrily decided and shouted at me that employees will now knock before asking to use the restroom, and that I have an attitude that needs correcting. 

Looking up OSHA regs hasn't helped. I'm up in WA. Every other job from State Parks to other retail stores to a factory allowed us to full on close the restroom for cleaning. No one ever complained about restricted access, and if someone really needed to go we would accommodate. I have repeatedly told the Store Director, with the entire staff to back me up, that I have never denied anyone access to the restroom. I just want to mitigate the wasted time and be courteous to everyone's workflow by suggesting a window at the start of the shift for people to use before I would put some kind of sign up to let them know which room I was in... and for that I am getting so much grief, personally attacked, lied to, etc. But hey, when informing my coworkers what time I will be cleaning is considered restricting access to the restroom... 

I am not trying to play God with who can relieve themselves. I am not mad people have to void. I am upset that I've tried to mitigate wasted time and my own panic attacks (that wouldn't happen if I wasn't jump scared constantly) only to be repeatedly accused of, ""Being mad people have to go."" I am upset that my needs are being ignored, and I hate playing the PTSD card and bringing up my own tragic backstory. I haven't needed accommodation in other workplaces because I could close the restroom and not have people pop in on me while I'm vulnerable. But here? This week alone I've been on the edge of hypervigilance from the hullabaloo. 

Any ideas how to protect myself if corporate gets involved? I've documented, I've researched. I just need to know what the laws are, what is being violated if who does what, and why I am being scapegoated for wanting to do my job without interruption. (There is more to the drama, but there aren't potential answers for those issues.)

Yeah. That’s the energy I’m chasing, unapologetic, chaotic, and way too fun to ignore.

**Me:** 36. Fit. Mixed Race, and 100% “why not?” I love to travel (ask me about the time I tried to order coffee in rural Vietnam and accidentally proposed marriage). I read philosophy books at bars, snort-laugh at my own Game of Thrones theories, and have a whisky collection that’s basically a shrine to bad decisions. Also: hairy chest, loud laugh, and a talent for turning grocery runs into existential crises.

**Here’s the deal:** Looking for something casual. Life’s too weird to stick to a script. I want someone who’s down to create a little chaos with zero drama. Think: midnight drives to Niagara for questionable wine, debating whether Cersei deserved that walk of shame, or laughing so hard at memes that we snort coffee.

**You:**

* Have a “why not?” attitude (or at least a mental one).
* Know the best dive bars where no one asks for your Instagram.
* Still defend your most unpopular opinion

**Let’s keep it simple:** No games. No guilt. Just two people who’d rather laugh at life’s dumpster fires than pretend they’re not there. Tell me the last thing that made you snort-laugh in public. Or why you’re still obsessed with that one song from 2015.

If any of this hits, slide into my DMs. Let’s stop faking it and actually feel something.
