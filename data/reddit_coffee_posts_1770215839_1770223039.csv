Calm atmosphere, comfortable seating, and a nice spot to work or study without too much noise. In frame today: a buttery croissant and a hazelnut café latte  solid combo for a productive session.

If you’re looking for a café where you can sit for a while, get work done, and enjoy good food and coffee, this place is definitely worth trying.

i literally spent days laying on my bathroom floor because the bed felt too big and empty. i thought the pain would actually kill me. like physically. my chest felt heavy 24/7.

i was convinced i would never be happy again. i thought i was ""damaged goods"" and that i missed my chance at a good life.

it’s been 4 years now.

and this morning, i woke up, made my coffee, sat in total silence, and realized i was smiling. not because of a text message, or a guy, or a grand event. just because the coffee tasted good and i felt safe in my own skin.

i know year 1 is hell.

i know year 2 is confusing.

but i promise you, the ""color"" comes back to the world.

you stop checking their socials.

you stop replaying the fights in your head.

and one day, you realize you haven't thought about them in weeks.

if you are in the thick of it right now, sobbing while reading this... please just hold on.

1qvt6ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qvt6ux/nttuner_complete_gui_solution_for_finetuning/,NTTuner - Complete GUI Solution for Fine-Tuning Local LLMs,"Hey r/LocalLLaMA! I've been working on a complete desktop solution for fine-tuning and deploying local models, and I wanted to share it with the community.

# What is it?

**NTTuner** is a desktop GUI app that handles the entire fine-tuning workflow:

* LoRA fine-tuning with GPU (Unsloth) or CPU support
* Automatic GGUF conversion
* Direct import to Ollama
* Real-time training logs in a non-blocking UI

**NTCompanion** is the dataset creation tool:

* Universal web scraper for building training datasets
* 6-factor quality scoring to filter out junk
* Smart content extraction from any website
* Outputs directly to NTTuner's expected format

# Why I built this

I got tired of juggling between command-line tools, Python scripts, and manual GGUF conversions every time I wanted to fine-tune a model. I wanted something that just worked - drag and drop a dataset, click start, and have a working model in Ollama when it's done.

# Key Features

**NTTuner:**

* Drag-and-drop JSONL datasets
* Auto-detects your GPU and installs the right dependencies
* Background training that doesn't freeze the UI
* Saves training configs as JSON for reproducibility
* One-click export to Ollama with automatic quantization

**NTCompanion:**

* Scrapes websites to build training data
* Multi-threaded crawling (configurable 1-50 workers)
* Quality filtering so you don't train on navigation menus and cookie banners
* Pre-configured for recipes, tutorials, documentation, blogs, etc.
* Supports all major chat templates (Llama, Qwen, Phi, Mistral, Gemma)

# Technical Details

* Built with DearPyGUI for a responsive, GPU-accelerated interface
* Uses Unsloth for 2-5x training speedup on compatible GPUs
* Falls back gracefully to CPU training when needed
* BeautifulSoup for robust HTML parsing
* Optional Bloom filter for memory-efficient large crawls

# System Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
* NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM recommended (but works on CPU)
* Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

# Example Workflow

1. Use NTCompanion to scrape 1000 cooking recipes
2. Quality filter removes junk, outputs clean JSONL
3. Drop the JSONL into NTTuner
4. Select Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct as base model
5. Hit start, grab coffee
6. Model automatically appears in Ollama
7. Run `ollama run my-cooking-assistant`

# Links

* **NTTuner**: [https://github.com/noosed/NTTuner](https://github.com/noosed/NTTuner)
* **NTCompanion**: [https://github.com/noosed/NTCompanion](https://github.com/noosed/NTCompanion)

# Current Limitations

* NTCompanion doesn't handle JavaScript-heavy sites perfectly (no headless browser yet)
* GGUF conversion requires manual steps if using CPU training without Unsloth
* Quality scoring works best on English content

# What's Next

I'm working on:

* Better JavaScript rendering support
* Multi-language dataset support
* Fine-tuning presets for common use cases
* Integration with more model formats

Would love to hear feedback from the community! What features would make this more useful for your workflows?

**TL;DR**: Built a desktop app that makes fine-tuning local LLMs as easy as drag-and-drop, with an included web scraper for building datasets. No more wrestling with command-line tools or manual GGUF conversions.",1,1770222542.0,LocalLLaMA,1,1.0,False

In a way, she has kind of been bedridden. She struggles going up and down the stairs so she’s in her room upstairs a majority of the time.

My sister and I take turns brining her things like food to her. She nitpicks everything. We used the wrong cup for her coffee, coffee is too light, we gave her more or less of food, etc. nothing is ever right. My sister told her “I brought you breakfast, no complaining”. 

Yesterday, my sister and AM got into a huge fight. My sister was supposed to pick up something from a store for AM and I guess has been delaying this task.  My sister got a little snippy about and said “I said I would do it today didn’t I?” AM started going off about how we don’t do anything. Are you fucking serious? My sister has been driving you to and from your doctor appointments, mad props to her. And I have been getting your groceries while I’m stressed out about interviews. Lol at this point, I don’t really care anymore where I end up with my job. Even if it’s in the middle of nowhere. Anything sounds better than being with this monstrous AM.

One simple way to test this is using **Google’s Keyword Planner**:

* Go to google ads
* Open Tools & Settings → Keyword Planner
* Click “Discover new keywords”
* Enter your food items or cuisines
* Set your city or area
* Look at monthly search volumes

This shows what customers nearby are actually looking for (like “chicken shawarma,” “vegan burger,” “cold coffee,” etc.). Those high-demand searches are signals for what should be on your menu, or what should be highlighted more.

I’m curious:  
Have you ever checked what food people are searching for in your area before deciding what to sell?

1qvt4wo,https://i.redd.it/hk2545b48ihg1.png,Is a 30-day Dopamine Detox actually worth it? (My honest results),"Everyone talks about ""dopamine detoxes"" like they’re some magic pill. I used to think it was just
another productivity trend for people who have too much free time.
But then I realized I couldn't even sit through a 10-minute YouTube video without checking my
phone three times. My brain was fried. I was constantly ""busy"" but getting absolutely nothing
done. I decided to go all in for 30 days. No mindless scrolling, no binge-watching, no junk food, and no ""background noise"" music.
Here is what actually happened.

The First Week: I hated everything. The first 7 days were pure mental withdrawal. I’d reach for my phone every five minutes like a reflex. I felt restless, bored, and honestly, pretty irritable. I realized I hadn't been ""alone with my thoughts"" in years. I was just constantly numbing myself with content.
The Turning Point: The ""Fog"" lifted by week three, something weird happened. Small things started feeling ""fun"" again. A cup of coffee, a walk without a podcast, a conversation with a friend—these things actually gave me a hit of genuine hit of enjoyment instead of just being background noise.

My focus came back. I could actually sit down and work for 4 hours straight without feeling that
""itch"" to check Instagram.

How I actually stayed consistent I'll be honest—I almost quit on Day 10. I got distracted, felt like I was missing out on the world, and almost went back to my old habits of doomscrolling until 2 AM.

I realized that ""willpower"" isn't enough when your brain is literally wired for distraction. I started
using Purposa app just to keep my daily goals in front of me and stay accountable. It’s hard to
slip back into old habits when you have a system that forces you to look at what you actually
wanted to accomplish that day.

I also started using Notion to dump all the random creative ideas that started flowing once my brain wasn't clogged with TikToks. You don't have to use these specific apps, but if you don't
have a system to track your progress, you will fail when the boredom hits.

The Verdict: Was it worth it?
100%. I didn't become a monk, but I did reset my baseline.
My anxiety dropped because I wasn't constantly comparing my life to 15-second clips of others.
My productivity doubled because I stopped leaking energy into distractions.
I actually enjoy my life more because I'm present for it.

The goal isn't to delete the internet forever. It's to stop being a slave to the ""instant hit"" so you
can actually build something that matters.
Give it 30 days. You’ll be bored out of your mind at first, but on the other side of that boredom is

**TLDR; on Feb 19th from 5:30p-8p, my company is hosting an art show for a wonderful 88-year-old man who is hoping to find homes for his beautiful paintings.**

**Pieces will range from $50-$350, but there's no pressure to buy - just having people see and appreciate his work would mean the world to him. You can RSVP** [**here**](https://partiful.com/e/KP8ujepBTkx7tU5fJas4?f=1)**!**

More backstory:

A few months ago, we met Ben, a retired psychiatrist whose lifelong passion has been painting. Though he's shown his work occasionally over the years, his focus on his practice meant he’s never fully shared it with the world.

Over coffee, he shared his biggest fear as he ages: not finding homes for his work before he’s gone. He does not have anyone in his life who is able to help him do this.

We were so inspired by his story and his beautiful paintings that we want to help him fulfill this mission.

On February 19th, from 5:30-8pm, [Hera](https://hellohera.com/) (hellohera.com) will be hosting an art show with Ben’s pieces in our office. We’ll have sips and snacks, and would love for you to come join us.

Our company provides care management, not art, but we're stepping out of our usual work to do this. We've already become his first collector, giving one of his paintings a permanent home in our office. 😊",2,1770222343.0,manhattan,0,1.0,False

Throughout my school life, I stayed in my shell. I never participated in activities because of stage fright and social anxiety. I also come from a place where extracurricular activities weren’t really encouraged, so opportunities were limited to begin with. Whenever I wanted to try something, I was usually discouraged especially by my father.
You might assume that since I didn’t have hobbies, I would’ve been great at studies. That wasn’t the case. I was an average student in subjects like history, maths, literature, and languages, and I barely passed science-related subjects. The one thing I genuinely enjoyed was sketching, and I was above average at it, but I was never enrolled in any classes or clubs.
When I needed to earn money, I took tuition for a student from 4th to 7th standard. Later, I did some very basic social media work mainly posting Instagram stories for a local coffee shop. I wouldn’t call it a real skill, and because of that, I don’t feel confident offering freelancing services.
Currently, I’m enrolled in a non-attending university pursuing a Bachelor’s in Commerce, and alongside that, I’m doing a professional course to become a compliance officer. For the first time in my life, I want to truly overachieve. I don’t want to just “get by” anymore.
Right now, I don’t have access to many extracurricular opportunities, but I do have my studies. My goal is to excel academically aim for first rank, earn awards, certificates, and prove to myself that I’m capable of more than what my past reflects.
What hurts the most is feeling like my school life is a blank page. I didn’t have many friends, I didn’t build skills, and I didn’t create memories. Looking back, it feels like I wasted those years not because I wanted to, but because I didn’t know how to do better.
I know changing your life is difficult and exhausting, but I don’t want to keep living on autopilot. I want to look back one day and know exactly where I spent my time and what I worked for.
If anyone here has been a late bloomer, started from scratch, or reinvented themselves academically or personally, I’d really appreciate hearing your experience or advice.",1,1770222227.0,twenties,1,1.0,False

I hear shuffling in the kitchen.🙄 I get up and ask Marilyn what she’s doing, she says “getting cereal” she has a wine glass (which are on the top shelf and not easy to get to). I say “go back to the couch, I’ll get it. We don’t use wine glasses for cereal” she goes “oh. Ok” she shuffles back to the couch, I get her cereal (how did she think she was gonna transport cereal and milk while also using a walker, regardless of the receptacle, I dunno).

She eats.

A little later, I hear shuffling, I get up and say “what are you doing Marilyn?”

“Going to the bathroom”

“Ok well Lola (my teen) is taking a shower in there, so please only pee”

I wash some dishes while she pees. I hear a noise. I hear Lola yell “mom! Neena fell”

Marilyn is sprawled (as much as you can be in our tiny bathroom) on the ground.

I can’t pick her up. I may be strong, but I’m not that strong. I try a couple times and eventually I had to get my husband to help me and together we were able to get her up. We had her halfway up and if she would’ve just PUT HER WEIGHT ON HER LEG we could’ve done it the first time but the thought of moving her leg to put her foot under her for support was just nowhere in her mind. She just flailed there in our arms with this blank look on her face. She had to be supported by both of us and her walker back to the couch (where she’s sleeping/existing).

2:00am Nick wakes me up “your mom is yelling for you” I go see. She has to pee. I help her up, she pees. I get her back to bed and go to pee as well (I mean, if I’m up, why not?)

THE TOILET IS CLOGGED

Why? Bc I forgot she uses a massive ton of toilet paper at her house. Like she winds the roll around her hand MULTIPLE TIMES even for urine. That may work in her house but not with my 70 year old plumbing.

So I had to unclog the toilet then pee and go back to bed. So I’m gonna have to ration the toilet paper out to her from now on bc I can’t afford plumbing issues and she won’t remember that she can’t use all that toilet paper.

She’s fallen at least once a day since she got here bc my home is not safe for someone with dementia and mobility and balance issues. And she can’t bathe bc she can’t lift her legs over into the tub, even with one of those shower chairs (which we got one), so she’s doing t&a baths bc it’s all we can do.

And to top it off, her dogs PEED ON MY KIDS BACKPACK andplusalso the rug in front of my stove is ruined and I really like it, but I don’t think I can salvage it bc don’t think it’ll fit in my washer. But I realized an entire corner was soaked in dog pee. I have pee pads out ALL OVER MY HOUSE and they sometimes use the pads, but mostly they just go wherever.  Within the first couple hours of them being here they peed on my cat tower and my cats beds. Everything is terrible.

And this morning I was up, trying to just chill and drink my coffee for about an hour and she was trying to get up for one reason or another every few minutes and asking to go to her house today to see if it’s ok to move back into. I said no, my husband has to work and the rats are everywhere and it’s just not safe for anyone to live there anymore and she goes “rats?” Like she didn’t remember.

I have a fridge, a dishwasher, a medium sized counter top microwave and a few small appliances like crockpot, air fryer, toaster oven and a coffee maker. I do not run all of these at the same time - but would like too.

Simula sa heartbreak niya sinamahan ko siya. Simula ng nawalan siya ng trabaho, ako ang naging provider niya. Nagsimula siya ng new venture sa career, sinuportahan ko siya all the way. He failed, and I was his comfort. Maraming nagsabi na iwanan ko na siya dahil parang nandyan lang siya kasi kailangan niya ko. All dates, all his needs, intimacy, financially and all nandon ako. Sa twing nakakita ako ng damit na bagay saknya, mas siya naiisip ko kesa bilhan ang sarili ko. At Nasanay ako na kahit konting lambing lang at effort niya okay na ko. Na minsan kinagagalit niya pa kapag nanghihingi ako ng time. Baka depress, malungkot and searching pa siya ng sarili niya. I patiently waited for 6 years, na maging masaya at maging okay siya. And then oneday, a great opportunity came. Nagkaron siya ng bagong career, nagkatrabaho at sumweldo ng 6 digits, first sweldo, binili niya lahat ng gusto niya and mga pangarap para sa sarili niya. Masaya ako para saknya. But he never even ask me for a date, ni 3 in 1 na kape. Di niya ko naalala. Kako baka naman next time, the next sahod, he was out to treat his cousins, relatives, and other friends. And again, I was left out. Niyaya ko siya mag lambingan time, and mag coffee. Ako na naman din gumastos sa staycation and sa cafe and transpo. And after another 20 days nakikipaghiwalay. He needs a different path para ayusin ang buhay niya. Nagsimula na siya mag travel, mag simba, now buy siya ng new car niya. And then kahapon sa my day, sa coffee shop my pa picture ng 2 coffee na may bag ng babae. And it breaks me. First time kong mabitawan ang coffee na hawak ko habang naglalakad na parang sa movie na slow motion ang lahat. And isa lang nasabi ko sa sarili ko.

1qvso3x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qvso3x,Java Roasters: Ramos Ccoillar Family,"Trying my first bag from Java Roasters.

I selected it based on the image design (lol) and the tasting notes. 

I much prefer low acidity and bold chocolate/nutty flavours. I also love black forest cake so this peaked my interest.

These beans are more acidic than I anticipated for being a darker roast. I'm learning that different bean origins and processes produce higher or lower acidity which will help me be more specific in my future choices. 

The initial flavours of the coffee are the chocolate sauce, think of a rich syrup on a cake or ice cream. The dried fruits and cherry notes come in later. 

Overall (and for my personal preference), I give it a rating of 7.8.

Brewing:

Breville Bambino and DF54

Grind: to flavour profile

16g in, 32-40g out (did not find a huge flavour difference).

1qvsn79,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1qvsn79/birding_in_the_cloud_forest/,Birding in the Cloud Forest,"# What Is It Like to Go Birdwatching in a Cloud Forest?

Discovering a place for the first time always awakens curiosity, but for those of us who love nature, one question arises immediately: *What birds live here?* Birdwatching is an activity of slow, quiet movements that require only moderate physical effort, yet is filled with intense moments of emotion. An unexpected song or the fleeting flight of a bird through the vegetation is enough to make the heart race. Birdwatching demands full attention, patience, and a constant openness to surprise.

Before venturing into the forest, it is helpful to understand the type of ecosystem you are visiting. Knowing the environment allows one to imagine which species might appear, although nothing is guaranteed. Birds are unpredictable, diverse, and often elusive. Research is part of the ritual, but even so, one never feels completely prepared for what the forest chooses to reveal.

The Monteverde cloud forest is a complex system, suspended high in the Tilarán Mountain Range, with one face oriented toward Costa Rica’s Caribbean slope. Here, elevations rise rapidly from 1,000 to more than 1,700 meters above sea level. Humidity is constant, and the wind accompanies the cool mornings, creating an atmosphere that feels frozen in time. This forest is not isolated; it forms part of a vast mosaic of protected areas that grants it exceptional biological richness.

At dawn, the understory comes alive. The sharp, cheerful songs of birds emerge from among shrubs, palms, bamboo, and fallen trunks—remnants of trees that once held sunlit canopies. Higher up, among moss-covered branches, tiny epiphytes appear, bearing bright flowers adapted to extreme conditions. Everything in this ecosystem is in constant transformation, and those who inhabit it must adapt and find balance to survive.

Although the day begins early and daylight is present, the sun's warmth is not always felt. Often it remains hidden behind a thick blanket of clouds that envelops the landscape. The moss covering trunks and branches becomes a natural banquet for insect-eating birds, thanks to the abundance of organic matter. Bromeliads, ferns, and orchids silently compete for a ray of sunlight, forming a living network that supports countless species.

In these forests, woodcreepers of the family *Furnariidae* are discreet protagonists. With cryptic coloration, they move swiftly, climbing tree trunks almost vertically. Also, we get the presence of warblers such as the Redstart, residents of the highlands, along with the wrens, finches, tapaculo, barbets, toucanets, and the ever-elusive hummingbirds. And, of course, there is always the hope of encountering the majestic resplendent quetzal, or perhaps hearing the deep call of the bellbird or sensing the imposing presence of the umbrellabird.

Along the forest edges, the large leaves of the poor man’s umbrella reveal hunting scenes of the flycatchers, known by many as “boomerang birds,” as they dart out and return to the same perch time and again. With a bit of luck, it is possible to detect species that inhabit the darkest parts of the forest, almost like ghosts: tinamous, black-breasted wood-quail, or certain finches that only reveal themselves through their calls. Other birds, such as antpittas or quail-doves, appear only by sheer chance.

But Monteverde is not only a cloud forest. On the other side of the mountain, the landscape changes. The environment is drier, at lower elevations, with gentler slopes. Here, forest remnants coexist with dairy farms, coffee plantations, and sugarcane fields. This is the side where much of the tourist infrastructure is concentrated, and where a diversity of landscapes gives rise to an even more complex bird community.

Moss loses its prominence, while bromeliads stack upon one another, accompanied by lichens that paint the tree bark. Flowers are more abundant and diverse, and strangler figs spread across the canopy. Fig trees and wild avocado trees, heavy with small fruits, become gathering points for birds and other animals. Here, birdwatching is especially rewarding: there are fewer hiding places, and birds make themselves known through more familiar vocalizations.

Flycatchers no longer need large moss-covered trees; a simple power line will do. A single fruiting fig tree can bring together a surprising diversity of life. Flocks of parrots and parakeets cross the sky, calling constantly. Along dusty roadsides appear the motmot, some woodpeckers, jays, and grackles, always active. As one ventures back into the forest, the songs of the clay-colored thrush, doves, keel-billed toucans, and wrens are heard—more often heard than seen.

Among the treetops, large birds glide without flapping their wings: chachalacas and crested guans move with quiet elegance. Higher still, among branches tinted copper by the mistletoe, euphonias, chlorophonias, and honeycreepers hide, drawn to their fruits. Ancient Treedaisy trees, planted long ago along fences to divide farms, still connect fragments of the landscape, offering food and shelter to wildlife. Over time, ecotourism has provided many landowners with a more sustainable and less impactful livelihood, allowing these forests to remain home to an extraordinary diversity of life.

Going birdwatching means waking up early, choosing the right equipment and clothing, preparing for sudden temperature changes, and carrying water and a small snack. But above all, it means opening the senses and allowing the natural world to surprise you without haste. Because in the cloud forest, every step can be a revelation, and every song a story heard only once.

Yeah, me too. It's frustrating to feel like every ""deal"" is a trick, designed to make you *think* you're saving big when you're really not.

I've gotten pretty good at sniffing out these fake discounts, and the genuine finds are out there if you know where to look and have a little patience. Here are a few recent examples where a quick check saved me some actual cash:

*   **Kitchen Gadget (e.g., specific brand immersion blender):**
    *   Saw it at a major retailer: ""$69.99, Was $119.99!"" – looked like a great 40% off.
    *   My quick check: A quick search on a price history tracker showed this exact model regularly sells for $75-$80. Another online store had it for $72.99 with free shipping, no ""sale"" tag needed.
    *   *Real Saving:* By not jumping on the first ""deal,"" I knew the actual market price and saved myself from buying at a slightly inflated ""sale"" price. Time invested: 5 minutes.

*   **Smart Home Bulbs (4-pack):**
    *   Advertised on a tech site: ""$34.99, Original $59.99!"" – about 40% off.
    *   My quick check: Price history revealed this 4-pack often drops to $28-$30 during seasonal events. I added it to a price alert.
    *   *Real Saving:* Waited about 10 days, and an email alert popped up: the same pack for **$27.99** from a different vendor. That's an extra $7 saved compared to the initial ""deal."" Time invested: 2 minutes to set alert, 1 minute to check email.

*   **Premium Coffee Beans (12oz bag):**
    *   My local grocery had my favorite brand: ""$14.99, Usually $17.99!""
    *   My quick check: Remembered seeing it slightly cheaper at a wholesale club, but they only sell 2-packs. Looked up the per-ounce price.
    *   *Real Saving:* The wholesale club had a 2-pack for $26 ($13/bag). Opted for that, knowing it's genuinely cheaper in bulk. *Actual savings*: $1.99 per bag, which adds up significantly over time. Time invested: 3 minutes to compare.

Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't about magical ""life-changing hacks."" It takes a little effort. You might not always find a dramatically better price, and sometimes that advertised ""sale"" *is* actually the best current price. Stock can be limited, shipping times vary, and regional availability is a real thing. The goal isn't to get *everything* for dirt cheap, but to make sure you're not getting played by marketing and are actually getting good value for your money.

I realized a few things about Nukkun and Lemons Nagoya TV tower date, and some of them are sad.

First, Lemon tried to imply the date was a spur-of-the-moment event. But Lemon actually carefully planned the romantic location, the route, the open hours, and even learned the bus schedule. Even a lie about needing a toothbrush, to lure Nukkun out.

Why all this meticulous planning? Lemon wanted to do something very important. If all went well, Lemon was planning to confess that night. She sprang the date on him with no warning, because she wanted his real reactions, not something he's already had time to rehearse at home. This is different from their aquarium date, where they both had plenty of time to prepare.

Things were proceeding with Nukkun only stumbling occassionally.  But then all progress came to a halt, when Lemon quietly asked Nukkun about his activities with other girls.  His answer was the worst:

""Yakishio, how much do you know?""

Nukkun's answer is the same as him telling her that he is exactly the scumbag and womanizer that the scandal sheet made him out to be. Yakishio hasn't been able to be involved in the Lit Club day-to-day activities, like Anna and Komari. She likely encountered some of those rumors about Nukkun when she first read the scandal sheet, looking over his shoulder.

""Oh, a certain Enemy of Women showed up.""

""You don't know that that's me.""

""It's you, though.""

She gave him the opportunity to explain things.  Instead his guilty question, ""how much do you know"", made it seem like the truth was even worse than the scandal sheets claimed.

""You really are the Enemy of Women!"" With this the confession plan was over, Yakishio's mission failed.

For Nukumizu, however, its mission accomplished. His portrayal of himself as a scumbag playboy successfully stopped Lemon's confession, just like he meant it to. He's not that stupid and he knew of the TV towers reputation. People who are not already a couple don't normally go there, for the night view.

\*\*\* THIS IS WHERE THE SPECULATION BEGINS \*\*\*

Now I'll explain why Nukkun's victory was in reality a terrible loss. It's not just because hidden inside the Nagoya TV tower is a luxury hotel. Which I'm sure Lemon knew about because she had already researched the TV tower completely. (It's why the TV tower is considered an adult dating site.) Would a girl who already admitted she stripped down to her underwear, then deliberately climbed into your futon, consider this option? Of course she did.

But that's not the loss I'm talking about.  Lemon had been telling Nukumizu that after her brilliant performance qualifying for the Nationals, multiple sports agent are already scouting her.  She's had to seriously think about her running career.  She dropped hints like, ""you'll have Anna and Komari in the club"". Lemon has always clung to Nukkun in her crisis moments, and this is the reason for her sudden confession urgency.

Lemon is likely planning to transfer overseas soon, much earlier than the normal graduation date. This is real serious, life-changing business.

>High school athletes in Japan can benefit from early college placement programs that help them connect with universities in the USA and Canada, particularly through agencies that offer scouting and try-out opportunities. These programs often assist with the admissions process and provide support for obtaining scholarships based on athletic and academic performance.

This is Lemon's best chance.  And she wanted to share that future with Nukkun. No one could say anything if they traveled overseas and they were married (age limit exception with parental consent.) Nukkun would be separated from Kaju even sooner than his parents hoped, so of course they'd jump at this. This is the future Nukkun threw away.

Now the first ending of the story is, with Lemon out of the picture, Kazu drops into Anna's lap with no effort.  Yay, Anna wins! (Does she love Nukumizu with the same intensity that Lemon does?)

But I prefer a different ending. Anna summons her angelic side once again, and selflessly supports her friends love, explaining reality to Kazu and sending him off, just like she did with Sosuke. Then she drinks Kazu's iced coffee that he left behind. Komari said ""Anna's story is out of order, the end is in the beginning.""

There are other alternatives. Kazu might regret what he did, and try to rejoin Lemon when he graduates and has to leave home (and Anna?) anyway. Without Nukkun's guidance, Lemon's career may tank and she would return home. Or here's a weird one. The thing that made Kazu more alert over time might owe less to Anna's kindness, than to Lemon strong physical stimulation.  Which means without that he might shrike back into the husk he once was.",1,1770220915.0,TooManyLosingHeroines,6,0.57,False

I’ve been using my Profitec Move for a while now and I’m gradually getting the hang of it. However, I’ve run into something that I find hard to explain or fully understand.

Quite often, when I use pre-infusion, the shot seems to choke badly: barely any espresso comes through the basket. The strange part is this: if I stop the shot and then immediately start another program *without* pre-infusion, the coffee suddenly flows much faster and fairly normally.

I notice a similar effect during a regular shot as well: if it starts off very slow or clogged, stopping the shot and starting it again right away often results in a much faster flow. It almost feels like some kind of pressure release or pressure switch effect.

What’s consistent, though, is that the machine always shows a stable pressure of around 9 bar.

Can someone help me understand what’s happening here, or point me in the right direction? Any technical explanations or practical tips would be very welcome.

For context:

* Grinder: Fiorenzato AllGround Sense
* I WDT
* I tamp carefully and consistently
* Basket: Pullman 17–19 g

* Enough space to comfortably work from home
* Green space or parks nearby
* Ideally not far from a Trader Joe’s and a dispensary (even if it’s a bit of a hike by foot)

She teased him saying that all his cum belonged to her, she wouldn’t let him cum anywhere but in her pussy. He begged her to fuck him. He was ready to cum. She got up and sat down on his dick. She rode him hard. She said be a good boy and cum in your little sisters pussy. He came hard, cum gushing into her. She orgasmed as he came. She got off and scooped some out of her pussy and swallowed it smiling. She untied him and they kissed and cuddled and went to sleep. 

The next morning they got breakfast and coffee. They talked and laughed like a normal couple. They saw some sights and Emma said they should head back to the room. They got in and she opened up the rest of the boxes. She said that he was a good boy last night, it was his turn to be the dominant one. She wanted him to fully take charge. She would be his sex slave the rest of the time in Milan. He could do whatever he wanted with her, be as rough as he wanted. He grinned. He went over to the bags and opened them. There were bdsm lingerie and accessories. He told her to come forward and get on her knees. She obeyed. 

He grabbed her chin and lifted for her eyes to meet his. He said that he was not only her big brother, but her master. She would obey his every command. He owned her now. He told her to strip. She did. He handed her a body harness and told her to put it on. He held her hands behind her back and handcuffed them together. He put a blindfold over her eyes. Then he told her to get back on her knees. He took off his clothes, his dick hard and in her face. He told her to suck. She leaned forward and began sucking his cock. He told her to be messy. She started sucking sloppily, drooling as she slurped on his dick. He held her face in his hands and began fucking her face. He pounded into her mouth, her cheeks bulging as he thrusted. Drool pooled out of her mouth and down her breasts and stomach. He pulled out and rubbed his wet cock all over her face. She sucked on his balls. Saliva covered her face. He slapped her face. He told her to beg for more. She did. He shoved his cock back in her mouth and face fucked her more. He had her lick his ass, rimming him deep and licking his balls as he stroked his dick. Then he picked her up, choking her. He told her that he was going to fuck her pussy and her ass even rough and she would enjoy every second. She said yes brother I will. He threw her on the bed, face down. He grabbed her hips and pulled them up, her ass in the air with her hands handcuffed behind her back, her face down on the bed. 

He mounted her from behind, sliding slowly into her pussy. He pushed all the way in. He started to thrust, speeding up. He grabbed a leather paddle and spanked her ass as he fucked her. He told her to dirty talk about how much she loved it. She did. He spanked her hard and said that wasn’t good enough. I want to hear how dirty of a little sister I have. I want to hear everything you want me to do to you. She unleashed dirty talk, humiliating herself, what a dirty little sister she was, how bad she wanted him to fuck her, what all she wants him to do to her. Be descriptive and graphic. He grabbed her arms and yanked them back as he pounded roughly into her. She moaned and screamed. She orgasmed hard, pussy spasoming and clenching tight on his dick. 

He pulled out. He pulled her down to the edge of the bed so that she was still on her stomach and her legs were on the ground. He got a spreader bar and latched them to her ankles so that her legs stayed spread open. He whipped her ass, telling her to beg him to fuck her ass. She did. He pressed his dick against her asshole, slowly spreading it and entering her. She winced at the pain. He laughed and spanked her. He leaned forward and told her to enjoy the pain, her brothers dick stretching open her asshole. He thrusted in and out, going deeper and faster. He grabbed her arms behind her for leverage, throwing her body back and forth on his cock. He told her to dirty talk about how much it hurt and she loved it. She dirty talked like never before. How she loved being his dirty butt slut. How she loved her brothers cock in her tight asshole. He pounded her hard, fucking her with all her had. Finally he slammed in and came hard, cum spurting deep into her. She came violently from feeling his cum and feeling her brothers dominance. 

When he recovered, he pulled out of her gaping asshole. Her legs shook and quivered. He got up on the bed and lay down, her face on his dick. He told her to clean his dick, to worship it. She lay there, sucking his cock, licking it clean. She obeyed his every command. Worshipping his cock and balls. Her only thought was pleasing her brother, her master. He told her to deepthroat him and to make him cum again. She sucked deeply, making him cum down her throat, trying to swallow it all. Cum leaked out the sides of her mouth. 

He untied her. He hugged her close and kissed her head. He said that was good, pet, you made me very happy. She beamed with joy. They got in the shower together and washed each other off. They got in bed together and held each other close. He told her Joe much he loved her. He said that he’ll be dominant and rough while they’re in Milan, but never forget how much he loves her.

I've finally had the chance to dig into these two bags from my January subscription. I was really excited for these bags, having grown a bit sick of all of the spicy winter blends I've been seeing these last few months. We've got:

  
1. Rodrigo Sanchez Passion Fruit co-ferment | Columbia

2. (Negusse Debela) Danche Red Honey | Ethiopia

  
This was my first from Debela, and I'm incredibly excited to try more from them. The Danche is light, bright, and naturally sweet. It shines as a pour over and works with a number of recipes. My personal preference was to brew this slightly cooler (198F) and diluting the brew with an extra 30 grams of water after final extraction. This gives it a profile that starts to resemble black tea and really brings out the top notes. While it is very drinkable as espresso with milk, much of the delicate flavor is lost and it falls more into a general coffee flavor.

Rodrigo Sanchez is polarizing for my palate. Sanchez beans are like a master class in modern co-fermentation, but co's are not always something I can get behind. I love funk, but even I have a limit. This is definitely on the right side of that. This is a wildly fruity coffee with a silky, mango flavor and that distinct, passion fruit tartness. The fermented funk is additionally cut back with a bitterness on the back of the tongue. This is very enjoyable as a pour over, but the intensity of the fruit can be overwhelming in large amounts. As a shot with milk, it takes on the flavor of a stone fruit yogurt or the mango lassi that's advertised. If you have the means, this is definitely worth trying as a cortado.",7,1770220669.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

Like you do coffee chats or career discussions and network, so why does it affect me if somebody doesn't like me or is not as open as I am?


And I feel a lot of physical uneasiness in my body. And when that happens with roommates or somebody I deal with on a daily basis, I confront them or try to make them be humane or make them see that they're doing wrong if they are being unkind, inconsiderate. 


I try to reason, argue, explain, be kind - like with coffee chats, I know I can’t do anything but it still bothers me so much, and the fact that it bothers me is concerning, like girl, not everybody is going to like you, idk if this is insecurity or fear of being judged or what?


And I had this roommate who would every single day, like fucking violate my privacy and destroy my peace of mind, instead of getting the fuck out, I kept pleading, reasoning, begging, arguing, wtf ?


Please, I need help and advice on what somebody else did, how they broke out of these patterns and why does it still affect me, and I absorb a lot from their non-verbals, even if my rational mind doesn’t put labels on it, I still feel that uneasiness and for days it affects me, and I DON’T want this anymore. 

  
Also, I have awkward laughter, like I have this nervous laughter, if somebody seems off, like they are talking but there is no emotional bonding or emotions on their face, and they are cold, I smile or unvoluntarily laugh a lot, and I have no way of setting boundaries automatically, after days, I think and wish that i acted in a diffferent way, like why cant my mind automatically know or do the right thing with boundaries, why will i only know how to behave after years from the incident?

For years, coffee felt like a “solution”:

* tired → coffee
* stressed → coffee
* unfocused → coffee

But when I stopped, I realized it wasn’t solving anything  it was just resetting the same cycle every day.

What surprised me the most wasn’t the physical withdrawal.

It was noticing how automatic the habit had become.

A few things I learned during the process:

* Caffeine hides the real baseline I didn’t know what “normal energy” felt like anymore.
* Relapses don’t mean failure Every time I went back to coffee, it taught me when and why I reached for it.

Quitting caffeine made me more aware of how habits work in general especially the ones that feel harmless because they’re socially accepted.

If you’re on a decaf journey:

* What was the hardest part for you?
* And what surprised you the most after reducing or quitting?

1qvs4fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1qvs4fa/im_confused/,Im confused,"Hello redit. First post. Im hoping you guys can help. Ill do my beat to be brief, but I need to make sure I cover everything. I am skeptical about my LPR diagnosis. I think I might have suffered a chemical burn. Let me explain

Ill start with my diagnosis,symptoms, and my lifestyle pre diagnosis. Im 34. I was diagnosed with LPR by an ENT. She scoped my throat through my nose. ""Mild inflammatory changes on nasopharyngoscopy without mass; clinically stable today"" My symptoms are i cant sing high notes (I sing) and I have a bump in the back of my throat where my tonsil would be (removed when I was a child).Its about the size of a cashew, a little smaller, and its sometimes itchy if im dehydrated. Thats the extent of my symptoms. Ive been eating highly acidic foods my whole life. Ive drank vinegar. I eat stupid hot Thai food and straight chili peppers. Ive sucked on lemons just for fun, no joke. I have never experienced heartburn or stomach issues from any of this. I vape frequently. I have 2-3 drinks nightly. I dont drink enough water. I drink 1 cup of coffee every morning. I snore like a bastard, but not to point of sleep apnea.

Now let me explain the events around the diagnosis. 12/13 I cleaned my shower in an unventilated bathroom with 30% white vinegar. Not the stuff for cooking or cleaning counter tops. This stuff will melt through a cinder block. At the time, I didnt know that, and I was seriously choking in the fumes. I powered through, but it was brutal. 12/15 at night watching TV i felt the bump in the back of my throat with my tongue for the first time, it was painful. I put an ice cube on and and carried on. 12/20 i went to the doc in a box to be checked for covid/flu/bacterial throat infection. Came back negative. I cant recall if my voice was elaffected at this point. I traveled for christmas, and when I got home it had not gone away. Once home I tried to sing, and realized I could not sing high. I started drinking lots of water a day in small frequent sips and it seemed to help a little. I went to see a GP to rule out cancer/get a referral to and ENT on 1/20. I went to an ENT on 1/23 and got diagnosed.

By 1/25 I was taking the pills (PPI inhibitor twice a day, at least 15 min before morning tea and before dinner) and an antacid before bed (its 40MG omeprazole and 40MG Famotidine) ive stopped drinking coffee. I got a wedge and started sleeping upright with a memory foam wedge my wife bought me... which cured my snoring so shes stoked, lol. So am I tbh. Ive started cutting off food at 6pm to be asleep by 11pm. I cant stop vaping (20 year nicotine addict, quit smoking 2 years ago. 2 packs a day) but im trying to cut back with 3MG zyns and when I vape I do it in sessions and drink lots of water after. If I drink at night I drink vodka and water. I have 1 or 2.

I say all this to ask. Is it possible the acid fumes fucked my my larynx, and im just irritating it with vaping and dehydration so it cant heal? I dont notice any issue other then this bump and I cant sing. Other then that, im fine! My ENT kind of sucked. I have a follow up 2/29 and a second  option with my GPs recommended ENT in late March. Will my voice heal? Ill I have to live like this forever? Thanks for reading.",2,1770220212.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

[\[Part 2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p1eo5j/im_a_camera_guy_for_a_local_reality_show_part_2/)

One foot in front of the other. Step, step, step. On and on I walk back to my home. They'll need a camera guy for the next episode so I need to make good time. Head down at my feet pushing to get another mile over with. 

I walked for a full day with no stops. I had to get back in time for the next episode or they just might replace me with someone else. If that happens then I'm back out on the street with no family all over again.

They obviously left me there to test my loyalty, to see if I'm serious about my purpose. One day I'll be the one testing someone else's loyalty to the family and Tony will see me as an integral pillar.

It was a bit before 2:00 am when I finally dragged my body back to the HQ. They were already filming an episode when I got there. Just as I had thought. I force myself up the steps to see Ben behind the camera facing me along with Tony, and two new faces.

As I reach about halfway up the stairs the chatter is silenced by Tony's words “\*The stories were true…”. “\*The stories?” I reply. “*The prophecy has been fulfilled…”,* “The prophecy that I would make my way home?” I responded again. This goes back and forth for a bit before Tony looks back at the camera and says “This ain't right…”. He points his finger directly into my face and says “I don't like this… we're getting the *fuck* out of here. I got two new Dealzmen in tow, we gotta get the fuck out we gotta *evade*.” The camera is then handed to me. While this is happening one of Tony's initiates starts saying his intro as if it was his turn to speak. I'll get to *him* in a second.

“*I need you to do what you do best”* Tony says to me in a tone that almost sounds akin to worship. That's exactly what I needed to get back into the swing of things. I ask Tony why we're leaving and all he says is “Evading…” which I simply could not argue with. Oh yeah also Tony was wearing a sick Rick and Morty shirt which was the style of the time.

Tony walks inside to prepare while I stay outside to introduce the new members. Jerome is also out there chuffing darts but hadn't said or done anything that I could really mention. That *was* until that moment Tony said ‘evading’ standing next to Jerome, who I'm always happy to see. 

Bro was steezed out this day for some reason, polished timbs just chuffin darks and sippin brown.

“Hey what’s good, y’all tryna find some Dealz? \[Is that\] what's up? You know I appreciate the going out of your way to find the Dealz. It’s truly patriotic, something that's great for this country… You know what I always say ‘Keep America great’... um and finding Dealz is a way to keep America great, support this great ec- economy… I just wanna shout out my bros Lil Tay, Lil Tay keepin it real. Um… My boy Lil Pump, Lil Pump keep it goin, y’know’im’sayn… but uh… Most importantly of all… The Dealz, like that's the bloodline right there (stoops down to ash cigarette revealing crisp polished yellow Timbs). Without Dealz what are we, ya know? We’re communists, and fuck commies, ya know? But uhhh… On the real, on the real… uh… keep doing DMT, expanding that mind and the spectrum of life and uhhhh… yeah, yeah, who else wants some crack? (Takes juicy drag off cigarette)” 

That was as accurate as I could transcribe his words. I felt enlightened and confused all at once. It really is always a treat when Jerome chooses to impart his wisdom.

Finally we get to the other two who had been standing there. First was Stewart Dealzman, I never learned his backstory in all my time knowing him, I honestly never thought to ask him because it just sort of made sense that he’d be there. Incredibly fruity demeanor, if there ever was a glasses character in fiction you were looking at him. When I first met him his hair was buzzed on the sides and the top was in a ponytail. He wore a jack skellington hoodie and a Thor’s Hammer pendant around his neck. His voice was very soft and boyish despite him being taller and more muscular than me. Like my voice is more of a baritone but he was in the much higher registers. “The name’s Stewart Dealzman, those Dealz be in my blood” I responded “Oh do you get blood clots or anything” trying to be silly and he responds with “oh yeah they're horrible, comes out in my shit” while puffing his cigarette. Pretty icky.

Next was Beth Dealzman. She stares daggers into me any time I meet her gaze. Her hair was half ash brown, half pink with bangs pulled into a ponytail bun. She looked to be around my age and she was quite pretty if it weren't for the scowl she was always wearing when looking at me. She said she had Dealz in her shoes which were scuffed white addidas. Snazzy stuff.

Finally I went inside to pack urgently as Tony was not happy with how long the intro was taking. 

Finally it was time for our title segment. Tony brushes his hair over his shoulder saying “Someone's gonna be here… *To-mor-row.* Someone's gonna be here, I'm heading out. I'm bringing the Dealzmen in tow.” As he walks to the door. I pan over to see Stewart, I had forgotten his name so I asked again. “Stewat” he responded, arms crossed, looking pleased with himself. I then pan over to Beth who just stares in disgust.

Behind Beth, on the couch, Jerome pops his head out in a real happy mood. “He-llo? You tryna buy crack?” No one responds and Tony proclaims “*Je-rome… He will hold down the Dealz Hut*” while pointing at Jerome. Jerome thanks Tony profusely but Ben, who is on the other couch 90 degrees to the left laid down flat, is not happy about this.

“Are you fucking kidding me right now? Dumb fucking bitch” Ben says. “You shut the fuck up” Jerome snaps pointing back at Ben. “Ill fight you bitch, hard… and good… nice and good” Ben replies.

Not listening to any of this Tony tells Jerome “*Jerome… make sure he does not leave his Dealz-Room”* “Oh don't you worry about it bud, I'll make sure the bloodline runs true. Son’s’a’bitches like *this* make me sick” “Thats why I keep you around Jerome” Tony says going to dap him up. “God damn it, bring it in botha.both. You be safe out there! You gotta *fight, fight* for those Dealz!” Jerome says pulling Tony in closer with a look of pure determination. Ben tries to get a word in saying “The blood is eternal” as Tony responds to Jerome full of power “*I WILL SCREAM AS THE BLOOD RAINS FROM THE SKY AS MY DEALZ ARE UNQUENCHABLE!”* “God dammit… you make me wanna *kiss* ya… ya *MAKE* me wanna make love to ya brotha… I'm gonna touch ya… *I'll make sure its safe”* 

That really made the room feel weird, Ben even chimes in and says thats really fucked up. I have Jerome and Tony in a close frame as Jerome is pulling his brother closer and closer. Tony is visibly uncomfortable and his voice gets shaky. “I gotta get outta here” It gets pretty intense so I pull Tony back and we four rush out the door and stomp down the stairs.

Next scene we are outside and Tony is “smelling” the air like a snake, tasting the direction of our destination. “South bound” he says before we all pile in the Dealz Mobile. 

Roughly 773 miles from the Dealfinderz HQ is where we were headed. I only knew because I was in the passenger seat looking at the maps. Tony was very talkative and in a pretty good mood for the first bit of the trip but I could tell he was still on edge about this ‘evasion’ business. 

It wasn't long before the two new Dealzmen were asleep, about 30 minutes or so. When I turned around to check on them Tony had broken the silence “They're out. I fed them a lot of cold medicine before we left, so they're gonna be cold for a while. Keep an eye out for cops.” This stunned me. I almost didn't know what to say, I couldn't discern a reason for this. I've read stories about parents drugging their kids before driving off a cliff before and Tony was pretty stressed out about some presence just on our heels. Could our sect of the Dealfinderz be over? Could Tony be trying to take us on a trip and kill all of us so some authorities can't get us and turn us against him? I ask him, very timidly “ W-why did you drug them?” “Oh I just don't know how much I like those guys yet so I didn't want to talk to them the whole time. I just dont have the energy to just yap while keeping an eye out. Getting pulled over could really put a damper on this family vacation” Tony says with his classic smile. 

We didn't take Tony's car on this trip, I'm sure it was for an added layer of anonymity. I really had no idea why the police could be on the lookout for a crew of bargain hunters traveling to Florida for a family vacation.

We drove through the night dodging cops and only making stops for gas, coffee and peepee time. We managed to make pretty good time and it was daytime when we got there. A side note here, Alabama is the worst state, horrible. Bad roads and creepy towns, especially at night.

Florida was magnificent. The sun was shining and there were so many people out and about having fun, you could almost forget that some weirdo ate a bat in China or something causing the whole world to start getting sick. Florida's a red state though so everything was still open.

We had lots of fun down there, it really felt like a family vacation. We met up with two informants of Tony's at a local strip mall just off the beach. This was the strangest thing because I could swear one of them was that phantom woman from episode 2, but I could actually see her this time. Her partner didn't have great social skills, pretty relatable honestly, he didnt talk much. They must've been a different sect of our organization.

We wandered around the strip mall getting our Dealz at various stores. We stopped at a certain point in the day to hit a glitzy stand. Stewart finally got his moment to shine and claim a Deal for his first time on the show. He takes a big boy bite from his glizzy and says “it tastes like a deal” with a smirk, sounding like a man from a 20s speakeasy. Tony was not impressed. “...yeah, you're gonna have to be more flowery with describing your Dealz if you wanna be a true Dealzman” Stewart only responds by saying “its so juicy…” with a slight moan. No other way to say it, it was cringe. He displayed visual disappointment, it was a bit hard to see though because his glasses get dark in the sun.

This critique wasn't given without an example though Tony then begins to give a rundown of how he would go about describing the dog.

“To understand the art of the Deal you gotta find the formula you know, the *juiciness,* the *Girth,* the *Girth of the dog-”* 

\*“\*It *is* pretty girthy” Stewart chimes. “It is a very *girthy dog”* Tony remarks. I even put my 2 cents in. “I'll say… I'd even suck down that hot dog with no bites. I'd shove *that* up my snatch” 

“If you can take the hot dog and shove it up your snatch *that's a Deal.* That is the formula.”

We go into a few more stores while Beth splits off with the two informants. Upon leaving a Tillys Tony catches a whiff and begins to start sniffing the air again before pointing ahead saying “Dealz onward” then walking down the path past me.

On the way we find one of those pieces of wood with head holes cut out for families to take pictures in on vacation. This particular one was of a swimsuit clad family posing with some dolphins. We didnt have everyone here with us so we just had Stewart and Tony and I edited in pictures of everyone else. This would mark the final time Danny appears in any episode, I never really learned what happened to him. 

“This is the Dealz-family, family of Dealzmen, telling you there's no better Deal than happiness” A very tender speech from our patriarch.

We finally reunite with our informants at what I thought was our last stop of the day. Upon reaching the front of the store Tony feels the need to address the viewer once again.

“This is Tony Dealzman reporting from the Target. Joseph A. Target. *You* are my target.” I believe this was a show of dominance from Tony, just as he had made a threat to Adam A Walmart. I think he does this to display that without the consumer the guys at the top have no meaning for existence.

After exploring the store a bit we happen upon the toilet paper isle. It's ransacked, keep in mind this is March of 2020. Seeing the lack of butt paper Tony makes a look of disgust. Stewart pipes up and says “thats not a Deal they just took everything” trying to match Tony's expression. Tony's expression becomes one of malice. “Maybe if people practiced the art of the Deal more we wouldn't be going through a *pandemic…*” This vexed me, I responded “Tony are you saying you had a hand in the pandemic?” Because his tone sounded very knowing. I was cut off while speaking by Tony turning away from me towards and empty shelf. “That sir does not sound like a Deal” says Stewart as Tony climbs onto the shelf, breaking it. 

Just then the informants along with Beth appear and find the whole situation silly and meaningless. “Whatever, is there water?” The male informant says before walking off.

After a more or less uneventful visit to a local mega store, we stopped by the beach for some family fun time. Nobody thought to bring swim clothes so we mostly stayed on shore. Well, more *they* stayed on shore, I stripped down and frolicked around in the water. This was probably a bad idea because there was this red algae in the water and it made my skin so itchy and red for a week after. 

As you've probably noticed Tony was very serious the whole episode aside from his family comment. Something was clearly bothering him and we would soon find out why.

One last stop of the day we go to an apartment complex on the north side of town. We all get out and sit at a picnic table and wait for like an hour while Tony keeps checking his phone. The informants had left us by this point so it was only Stewart, Beth, Tony and me sitting in uncomfortable silence. 

Finally Tony assumingly got the information he was waiting for and we followed him to an apartment. There to greet us was this goblin-esque man. “*Come in, quick like. No need for prying eyes”*.

The apartment was very well decorated with lots of plants and glass decorations, they must've been loaded.

I didn't record much of anything at this point in our visit as it had nothing to do with the show. Tony made sure to tell me that this visit needs to be off the books as well so I was double not filming. 

We were sat in the living room as a man with a light olive skin tone and dark hair emerged from one of the rooms.

“*Tony Dealzman…* its been 8 years…” he says. “Patrick Dealzman you give me some sugar this instant”. Tony and Patrick embrace each other for the first time in too long and catch up a bit before getting to business.

“I've finally found it.” Patrick says to Tony. “You don't mean…” Tony responds. “Yes indeed… the anomalous Deal” Tony flashes a look back at the 3 of us on the couch before turning back to Patrick and saying “we should talk in another room” leaving us in the living room watching Rick and Morty. Stewart seemed very interested in what they were saying but I really wasn't paying close attention.

Before long they both came back out and watched some TV with us. Tony was holding this small cardboard box with him the whole time. For a second it opened a bit and I could swear there was a golden glow from the inside. Its crazy that Beth shot Mr Poopybutthole like that in that one episode, not cool Beth.

Randomly in our visit there was a loud banging on the door. We all looked at each other. Patrick and Tony's faces both went white. As I stood up to walk to the door Tony raises his voice to stop me “Wait NO-” cut off by tear gas smashing through the window. 

Immediately after that 4 men in SWAT gear smash in through the windows followed by 5 more smashing through the door and running up the stairs. 

“HANDS IN THE AIR!” They say pointing rifles at us 5. “*You're gonna have to kill me cuz theres no way I'm giving up this box”* Tony shouts as he stands up. The rest of us stand up shocked and not sure how to respond to the situation. “Let's all just calm down..” Stewart says, lifting his hands and trying to keep his eyes open. “*I'm not doing a damn thing”* Tony says before rushing the SWAT member closes to him. 

He pushes the gun up to the ceiling sending bullets spraying up the wall and ceiling, right next to me and also, where Patrick was standing…

The next few moments were a blur. Tony's eyes begin to shimmer gold and he pushes the cop into the others pulling a flashbang from his belt and yanking out the pin. 

Now I couldn't breathe and I was blind and deaf. Tony grabs my arm pulling me to a side window as I hear muffled screaming and gunfire. The window was on the second floor and I was thrown out one handed by my boss. 

I landed on my side smacking my head with a thud and crunch but my adrenaline kept me stable enough to sprint to the car with Tony. He shoves me into driver seat and says to just drive. I ask “what about the others?” “WHO CARES ABOUT THEM, THEY SUCKED ANYWAY. I'M NOT GOING BACK TO JAIL”

I peel out of the parking lot smashing through the guard at the front knocking off a mirror on the driver side. The Florida sun had just dipped behind the horizon and for a short while I admired the scenic beach as we sped down the highway. It almost seemed like we got away until we got to the outskirts of the city.

A road block was set up. “Step on the gas” Tony tells me. “What are you talking about? They got us” “If these cops catch us, ill kill you myself”

With no other option I floor it closing my eyes which definitely wasn't the brightest idea but I was scared what can I say. Somehow the Honda civic plowed through bucking a police SUV out of the way. They're honestly pretty sweet cars. Even though we pushed through the rest of the cars were soon on us.

“Whats this all about man?!” I say before Tony cuts me off “Look, we secured the *anomalous Deal* of a fucking lifetime. I *cannot* lose this Deal” “THIS IS THE DEAL OF A LIFETIME I CANT GO TO *JAIL*! I CAN'T GO OUT LIKE *PATRICK DEALZMAN”*

The rest of the footage is just me and Tony freaking out until I hit a pothole and flipped the car 5 times, sending me out the window because I was too scared to buckle my seat belt. I was knocked unconscious upon hitting the ground.

I faded in and out as I saw the police apprehending Tony as he screams maniacally, the box was nowhere in sight.

After probably a while of sleeping on the side of the road which is very normal to me the cops picked me up and hauled me to the police station.

As soon as they started questioning me I started crying. I had no idea what was happening and didn't know what to tell them. I honestly was only there for a job and was only doing what Tony made me do. They asked about the car which was apparently in my name which stunned me. Tony got me a car? That was really nice of him.

Eventually the cops realized I didn't know anything and gave me a coke and sent me on my way. Apparently insurance was paid on the car and all so I was able to get it fixed up and made my way back to the Dealz HQ.

I didn't really know what to do with myself when I got home. I was pretty banged up so I just hung around and played on Tony's PC, luckily his password was just “Dealz” so I was able to get in on some League of Legends. I had plenty of time to catch up on editing episodes, I still had a job to do afterall.

I tried to keep up with Tony's case, apparently he got sentenced to life for conspiracy, failure to appear, assaulting an officer, manslaughter, treason and loitering. 

Jerome was gone, so was Danny. I never learned quite what happened to Beth and Stewart. The only one to keep me company was Ben, who was usually locked in his room making beats, rarely coming out for redbull and to meet doordash drivers.

A few months later Stewart shows up at the house slimmer and with a new hairstyle. He was wearing a starwars T shirt with a tie draped over his neck, not tied. He was actually holding the camera when he walked in. I guess it was time to do a new episode. Not sure how we could without our leader or his 2nd in command but he had been through a lot so I humored him.

I didn't like having the camera on me so I took it back from him. Immediately things seemed weird. He notices two figures out the window looking into my car but we couldn't tell who they were.

One foot in front of the other. Step, step, step. On and on I walk back to my home. They'll need a camera guy for the next episode so I need to make good time. Head down at my feet pushing to get another mile over with. 

I walked for a full day with no stops. I had to get back in time for the next episode or they just might replace me with someone else. If that happens then I'm back out on the street with no family all over again.

They obviously left me there to test my loyalty, to see if I'm serious about my purpose. One day I'll be the one testing someone else's loyalty to the family and Tony will see me as an integral pillar.

It was a bit before 2:00 am when I finally dragged my body back to the HQ. They were already filming an episode when I got there. Just as I had thought. I force myself up the steps to see Ben behind the camera facing me along with Tony, and two new faces.

As I reach about halfway up the stairs the chatter is silenced by Tony's words “\*The stories were true…”. “\*The stories?” I reply. “*The prophecy has been fulfilled…”,* “The prophecy that I would make my way home?” I responded again. This goes back and forth for a bit before Tony looks back at the camera and says “This ain't right…”. He points his finger directly into my face and says “I don't like this… we're getting the *fuck* out of here. I got two new Dealzmen in tow, we gotta get the fuck out we gotta *evade*.” The camera is then handed to me. While this is happening one of Tony's initiates starts saying his intro as if it was his turn to speak. I'll get to *him* in a second.

“*I need you to do what you do best”* Tony says to me in a tone that almost sounds akin to worship. That's exactly what I needed to get back into the swing of things. I ask Tony why we're leaving and all he says is “Evading…” which I simply could not argue with. Oh yeah also Tony was wearing a sick Rick and Morty shirt which was the style of the time.

Tony walks inside to prepare while I stay outside to introduce the new members. Jerome is also out there chuffing darts but hadn't said or done anything that I could really mention. That *was* until that moment Tony said ‘evading’ standing next to Jerome, who I'm always happy to see. 

Bro was steezed out this day for some reason, polished timbs just chuffin darks and sippin brown.

“Hey what’s good, y’all tryna find some Dealz? \[Is that\] what's up? You know I appreciate the going out of your way to find the Dealz. It’s truly patriotic, something that's great for this country… You know what I always say ‘Keep America great’... um and finding Dealz is a way to keep America great, support this great ec- economy… I just wanna shout out my bros Lil Tay, Lil Tay keepin it real. Um… My boy Lil Pump, Lil Pump keep it goin, y’know’im’sayn… but uh… Most importantly of all… The Dealz, like that's the bloodline right there (stoops down to ash cigarette revealing crisp polished yellow Timbs). Without Dealz what are we, ya know? We’re communists, and fuck commies, ya know? But uhhh… On the real, on the real… uh… keep doing DMT, expanding that mind and the spectrum of life and uhhhh… yeah, yeah, who else wants some crack? (Takes juicy drag off cigarette)” 

That was as accurate as I could transcribe his words. I felt enlightened and confused all at once. It really is always a treat when Jerome chooses to impart his wisdom.

Finally we get to the other two who had been standing there. First was Stewart Dealzman, I never learned his backstory in all my time knowing him, I honestly never thought to ask him because it just sort of made sense that he’d be there. Incredibly fruity demeanor, if there ever was a glasses character in fiction you were looking at him. When I first met him his hair was buzzed on the sides and the top was in a ponytail. He wore a jack skellington hoodie and a Thor’s Hammer pendant around his neck. His voice was very soft and boyish despite him being taller and more muscular than me. Like my voice is more of a baritone but he was in the much higher registers. “The name’s Stewart Dealzman, those Dealz be in my blood” I responded “Oh do you get blood clots or anything” trying to be silly and he responds with “oh yeah they're horrible, comes out in my shit” while puffing his cigarette. Pretty icky.

Next was Beth Dealzman. She stares daggers into me any time I meet her gaze. Her hair was half ash brown, half pink with bangs pulled into a ponytail bun. She looked to be around my age and she was quite pretty if it weren't for the scowl she was always wearing when looking at me. She said she had Dealz in her shoes which were scuffed white addidas. Snazzy stuff.

Finally I went inside to pack urgently as Tony was not happy with how long the intro was taking. 

Finally it was time for our title segment. Tony brushes his hair over his shoulder saying “Someone's gonna be here… *To-mor-row.* Someone's gonna be here, I'm heading out. I'm bringing the Dealzmen in tow.” As he walks to the door. I pan over to see Stewart, I had forgotten his name so I asked again. “Stewat” he responded, arms crossed, looking pleased with himself. I then pan over to Beth who just stares in disgust.

Behind Beth, on the couch, Jerome pops his head out in a real happy mood. “He-llo? You tryna buy crack?” No one responds and Tony proclaims “*Je-rome… He will hold down the Dealz Hut*” while pointing at Jerome. Jerome thanks Tony profusely but Ben, who is on the other couch 90 degrees to the left laid down flat, is not happy about this.

“Are you fucking kidding me right now? Dumb fucking bitch” Ben says. “You shut the fuck up” Jerome snaps pointing back at Ben. “Ill fight you bitch, hard… and good… nice and good” Ben replies.

Not listening to any of this Tony tells Jerome “*Jerome… make sure he does not leave his Dealz-Room”* “Oh don't you worry about it bud, I'll make sure the bloodline runs true. Son’s’a’bitches like *this* make me sick” “Thats why I keep you around Jerome” Tony says going to dap him up. “God damn it, bring it in botha.both. You be safe out there! You gotta *fight, fight* for those Dealz!” Jerome says pulling Tony in closer with a look of pure determination. Ben tries to get a word in saying “The blood is eternal” as Tony responds to Jerome full of power “*I WILL SCREAM AS THE BLOOD RAINS FROM THE SKY AS MY DEALZ ARE UNQUENCHABLE!”* “God dammit… you make me wanna *kiss* ya… ya *MAKE* me wanna make love to ya brotha… I'm gonna touch ya… *I'll make sure its safe”* 

That really made the room feel weird, Ben even chimes in and says thats really fucked up. I have Jerome and Tony in a close frame as Jerome is pulling his brother closer and closer. Tony is visibly uncomfortable and his voice gets shaky. “I gotta get outta here” It gets pretty intense so I pull Tony back and we four rush out the door and stomp down the stairs.

Next scene we are outside and Tony is “smelling” the air like a snake, tasting the direction of our destination. “South bound” he says before we all pile in the Dealz Mobile. 

Roughly 773 miles from the Dealfinderz HQ is where we were headed. I only knew because I was in the passenger seat looking at the maps. Tony was very talkative and in a pretty good mood for the first bit of the trip but I could tell he was still on edge about this ‘evasion’ business. 

It wasn't long before the two new Dealzmen were asleep, about 30 minutes or so. When I turned around to check on them Tony had broken the silence “They're out. I fed them a lot of cold medicine before we left, so they're gonna be cold for a while. Keep an eye out for cops.” This stunned me. I almost didn't know what to say, I couldn't discern a reason for this. I've read stories about parents drugging their kids before driving off a cliff before and Tony was pretty stressed out about some presence just on our heels. Could our sect of the Dealfinderz be over? Could Tony be trying to take us on a trip and kill all of us so some authorities can't get us and turn us against him? I ask him, very timidly “ W-why did you drug them?” “Oh I just don't know how much I like those guys yet so I didn't want to talk to them the whole time. I just dont have the energy to just yap while keeping an eye out. Getting pulled over could really put a damper on this family vacation” Tony says with his classic smile. 

We didn't take Tony's car on this trip, I'm sure it was for an added layer of anonymity. I really had no idea why the police could be on the lookout for a crew of bargain hunters traveling to Florida for a family vacation.

We drove through the night dodging cops and only making stops for gas, coffee and peepee time. We managed to make pretty good time and it was daytime when we got there. A side note here, Alabama is the worst state, horrible. Bad roads and creepy towns, especially at night.

Florida was magnificent. The sun was shining and there were so many people out and about having fun, you could almost forget that some weirdo ate a bat in China or something causing the whole world to start getting sick. Florida's a red state though so everything was still open.

We had lots of fun down there, it really felt like a family vacation. We met up with two informants of Tony's at a local strip mall just off the beach. This was the strangest thing because I could swear one of them was that phantom woman from episode 2, but I could actually see her this time. Her partner didn't have great social skills, pretty relatable honestly, he didnt talk much. They must've been a different sect of our organization.

We wandered around the strip mall getting our Dealz at various stores. We stopped at a certain point in the day to hit a glitzy stand. Stewart finally got his moment to shine and claim a Deal for his first time on the show. He takes a big boy bite from his glizzy and says “it tastes like a deal” with a smirk, sounding like a man from a 20s speakeasy. Tony was not impressed. “...yeah, you're gonna have to be more flowery with describing your Dealz if you wanna be a true Dealzman” Stewart only responds by saying “its so juicy…” with a slight moan. No other way to say it, it was cringe. He displayed visual disappointment, it was a bit hard to see though because his glasses get dark in the sun.

This critique wasn't given without an example though Tony then begins to give a rundown of how he would go about describing the dog.

“To understand the art of the Deal you gotta find the formula you know, the *juiciness,* the *Girth,* the *Girth of the dog-”* 

\*“\*It *is* pretty girthy” Stewart chimes. “It is a very *girthy dog”* Tony remarks. I even put my 2 cents in. “I'll say… I'd even suck down that hot dog with no bites. I'd shove *that* up my snatch” 

“If you can take the hot dog and shove it up your snatch *that's a Deal.* That is the formula.”

We go into a few more stores while Beth splits off with the two informants. Upon leaving a Tillys Tony catches a whiff and begins to start sniffing the air again before pointing ahead saying “Dealz onward” then walking down the path past me.

On the way we find one of those pieces of wood with head holes cut out for families to take pictures in on vacation. This particular one was of a swimsuit clad family posing with some dolphins. We didnt have everyone here with us so we just had Stewart and Tony and I edited in pictures of everyone else. This would mark the final time Danny appears in any episode, I never really learned what happened to him. 

“This is the Dealz-family, family of Dealzmen, telling you there's no better Deal than happiness” A very tender speech from our patriarch.

We finally reunite with our informants at what I thought was our last stop of the day. Upon reaching the front of the store Tony feels the need to address the viewer once again.

“This is Tony Dealzman reporting from the Target. Joseph A. Target. *You* are my target.” I believe this was a show of dominance from Tony, just as he had made a threat to Adam A Walmart. I think he does this to display that without the consumer the guys at the top have no meaning for existence.

After exploring the store a bit we happen upon the toilet paper isle. It's ransacked, keep in mind this is March of 2020. Seeing the lack of butt paper Tony makes a look of disgust. Stewart pipes up and says “thats not a Deal they just took everything” trying to match Tony's expression. Tony's expression becomes one of malice. “Maybe if people practiced the art of the Deal more we wouldn't be going through a *pandemic…*” This vexed me, I responded “Tony are you saying you had a hand in the pandemic?” Because his tone sounded very knowing. I was cut off while speaking by Tony turning away from me towards and empty shelf. “That sir does not sound like a Deal” says Stewart as Tony climbs onto the shelf, breaking it. 

Just then the informants along with Beth appear and find the whole situation silly and meaningless. “Whatever, is there water?” The male informant says before walking off.

After a more or less uneventful visit to a local mega store, we stopped by the beach for some family fun time. Nobody thought to bring swim clothes so we mostly stayed on shore. Well, more *they* stayed on shore, I stripped down and frolicked around in the water.

**When Choice Becomes Paralysis: Local Woman's Mysterious Condition Baffles Doctors**

**By Rebecca Torres | November 15, 2024**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Jennifer Walsh stands in front of her closet every morning at 6:15 AM. She's been standing there for forty-three minutes now, staring at the same six shirts she's owned for years. Her hand reaches for the blue one. Stops. Reaches for the gray. Stops. Her breathing gets faster. Her chest tightens. She can't choose.

By 7:00 AM, her husband Michael finds her on the bedroom floor, sobbing, still in her pajamas. He chooses the blue shirt. Helps her dress like she's a child. The relief on her face is immediate.

This happens every single day.

""Eighteen months ago, Jen was a marketing director,"" Michael tells me in their Elora home, his voice worn thin from exhaustion. ""She managed a team of twelve. Made decisions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now she can't decide what to have for breakfast.""

Jennifer is twenty-eight years old. She has no history of mental illness, no childhood trauma, no obvious neurological damage. But since May of last year, her ability to make even the most basic decisions has simply vanished, and no doctor has been able to tell her why.

""It started small,"" Jennifer says, her voice barely above a whisper. She sits exactly where Michael positioned her on the couch, hands folded in her lap. ""I'd stand in the grocery store for twenty minutes trying to choose between two brands of pasta. I thought I was just stressed from work. But it kept getting worse.""

The progression was relentless. Within six months, she couldn't choose which route to drive to work. Couldn't decide whether to attend meetings. Couldn't select items from a menu. Her job performance deteriorated until she was placed on medical leave. That leave became permanent in May when she missed three weeks straight—not because she was physically ill, but because each morning she couldn't decide whether to go in.

""People don't understand what this feels like,"" Jennifer says, and for the first time her voice rises slightly, frustration breaking through. ""It's not indecision like normal people experience. It's not 'should I get the chicken or the fish.' It's like my brain hits a wall. Like the part of me that makes choices just... stops existing. And the anxiety that comes with it—"" She stops. Swallows hard. ""I've tried to kill myself twice because I couldn't bear it anymore.""

Michael's jaw tightens. He reaches over, takes her hand. For the past six months, he's made every single decision in their household. What they eat. When they sleep. What Jennifer wears. Where she sits. How she spends every hour of her day.

""I know how it sounds,"" he says, meeting my eyes. ""Like I'm controlling her. Like this is abuse. But if I don't make these decisions, she just freezes. She'll stand in one spot for hours if I don't tell her what to do next. This is the only way we've found for her to survive.""

The medical community has no answers. Jennifer has been to seven different specialists. She's had MRIs, CT scans, comprehensive bloodwork, genetic testing, psychiatric evaluations. She's been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and—most dismissively—conversion disorder, the modern term for what doctors used to call hysteria.

""Three different psychiatrists told me it was psychological,"" Jennifer says, anger creeping into her voice now. ""That I was subconsciously seeking attention or trying to avoid responsibility. They put me on every medication you can imagine. SSRIs made it worse. Benzodiazepines did nothing. Antipsychotics made me feel like a zombie but didn't touch the core problem.""

Dr. Lisa Holmes, a neurologist at Elora Medical Center, is one of the few physicians who believed something else was happening.

""When Jennifer came to me, I'd already seen two other patients with remarkably similar presentations,"" Dr. Holmes tells me in her office, pulling up brain scans on her computer. ""Young women, no psychiatric history, progressive inability to make autonomous decisions, no response to conventional treatment. The pattern was too specific to be coincidental.""

She shows me Jennifer's fMRI scans during decision-making tasks. The images are striking—while most of Jennifer's brain shows normal activity, her prefrontal cortex, the region responsible for executive function and decision-making, goes almost dark when presented with choices.

""It's not that she's anxious about deciding,"" Dr. Holmes explains. ""It's that the neural pathway for autonomous decision-making appears to be fundamentally impaired. We can see it shut down in real-time.""

But seeing the problem doesn't mean understanding it. Dr. Holmes has consulted with neurology departments across the country. She's sent Jennifer's scans to specialists at major research hospitals. No one has a diagnosis that fits.

""The specificity is what's so puzzling,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""Jennifer can answer questions. Her memory is intact. Her cognitive function is completely normal in every other domain. It's just this one thing—the ability to make choices—that's failed.""

What makes Jennifer's case even more troubling is that she's not alone—and the numbers appear to be growing.

Dr. Holmes has now identified six patients in Elora with similar symptoms. A twenty-two-year-old college student who had to drop out because she couldn't choose classes or decide whether to attend lectures. A thirty-five-year-old accountant who lost custody of her children after child protective services determined she couldn't make basic parenting decisions. A nineteen-year-old working at a coffee shop who attempted suicide after standing frozen in front of the drink menu for so long her manager called an ambulance.

""I started reaching out quietly to colleagues in other cities,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""I'm hearing about cases in the Pacific Northwest. Reports from the Southeast. Scattered sightings in the Midwest. It's not an epidemic yet, but there's something happening that we don't understand.""

Jennifer found others through social media. A Reddit group called r/DecisionParalysis has grown from a handful of members in January to over two hundred women describing strikingly similar experiences. They share stories of worsening symptoms, doctors who don't believe them, families who think they're faking, and a medical system with no answers to offer.

""Reading those posts was the first time I didn't feel crazy,"" Jennifer says. ""All these women describing exactly what I'm going through. One woman in Oregon said she stands in her shower every morning unable to decide whether to use shampoo first or body wash. Another woman in a suburb outside Atlanta said she lost her job as a teacher because she couldn't decide which lesson to teach. It's all the same pattern.""

The online community has become both support system and informal research network. Women document their symptoms, track progression, share which treatments failed. Some report that having someone else make all their decisions provides relief from the paralysis. Others describe family members who've grown frustrated and left. Several mention suicide attempts.

""What scares me is how many of them have been dismissed by doctors,"" Jennifer says. ""Told it's anxiety. Told to try harder. Told they're attention-seeking. But we're not making this up. Something is wrong with us and nobody knows what.""

There may be hope on the horizon. Dr. Holmes mentions that Arden Research Hospital announced a study last month investigating what they're tentatively calling ""autonomic decision paralysis."" The research team is actively recruiting patients and has received funding to conduct comprehensive neurological, genetic, and biochemical analysis.

""They're taking this seriously,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""They think there might be a common underlying pathology. Something neurological we haven't identified yet.""

But studies take time. Analysis takes time. For Jennifer and the growing number of women experiencing these symptoms, time feels like a luxury they don't have.

Jennifer hasn't worked in six months. Their savings are depleted from medical bills that insurance largely refused to cover, deeming most testing ""experimental"" or ""not medically necessary."" Michael has taken on a second job. Their friends have stopped calling—too many canceled plans because Jennifer couldn't decide whether to go out. Her parents live across the country and don't really understand what's happening to their daughter.

""I just want my life back,"" Jennifer says. She's looking at her hands, fingers twisted together. ""I want to be able to choose what shirt to wear. To decide what to eat for lunch. To make simple decisions without my brain shutting down completely. Is that too much to ask?""

She looks up at me, and her eyes are desperate in a way that makes my chest tighten.

""Sometimes I think dying would be easier than living like this.""

Michael's hand tightens on hers. He makes every decision in her life now. When she eats. Where she sits. What she wears. To anyone watching from outside, it looks like control. It looks like abuse.

But Jennifer says it's the only thing keeping her alive.

""Without Michael, I'd just freeze,"" she says. ""I'd stand in one spot until I collapsed. Or I'd try again to kill myself and maybe this time I'd succeed. He's keeping me functional. That's not abuse. That's love.""

The question no one can answer yet is: what happens when love isn't enough?

This morning I had a chat with Lord Lucifer about my next spiritual assignment and suddenly the idea of making him coffee popped into my head (which he probably put there) so I made him his coffee how he likes it (very strong and black, nothing in it) and I’m drinking my coffee alongside his altar. 

I thought it was a really fun way to bond with (one of my) patron deities and thought I should share 🫶🏻🧚🏻

If you’ve never tried it before, I highly recommend sharing a drink or some kind of mundane activity with your deity. It really helps you feel connected to them.

So I think my co worker likes me, I work in a corporate office by the way not sure if that’s important at all but anyways I’m not 100% sure but I can say that a lot of the things she does leads me to believe she likes me. We are both lesbians I’m quite young in comparison to her she’s about in her early 40s doesn’t look a day over 25, and I’m in my early-mid 20s. This past week was her birthday and I bought her a cake with a few of my other co workers I put about 2 dollars in it honestly we all did and at the end of it all she gave me this very big tight and close hug and was telling me how much she appreciated me and how special she felt and she was honestly so ecstatic, all of my other co workers noticed I didn’t really at the moment till one of my very close co workers mentioned that she feels the situation was odd and awkward I didn’t really notice much but it seems as though everyone noticed this “intimate” moment and just assumed it meant something, wasn’t that intimate to me I did feel the hug and appreciation was a bit much but I just thought she really appreciated the gesture and she is a touchy feely person which I don’t mind I’m single so not a problem anywho I’ve noticed since then I do always find her around? She’s always near by we work on the same floor so definitely could be coincidence but I feel she kind of lingers around me a lot  whenever I make coffee she makes coffee our mugs are next to each other often which I also didn’t find weird just figured all our mugs are usually in the same spots, she always talks to me whenever she can and she’s always trying to jokingly invite herself out with me which I never really thought about till now and like I said always assumed it was just friendly co worker stuff a lot of my co workers are the same with me not like as close or “intimate” but we are all tight knit. Today as well I noticed that she had been staring at me all morning she is constantly looking away every time I look at her she pretends she’s staring off around me and gets awkward I think now that my co workers are all mentioning it I’m kind of starting to connect some dots but I feel I could be reading in between the lines too much. She also comes up to me on a daily basis and we talk about being Lesbian and our past and to my knowledge she has a few options I have none and I haven’t been really looking for any I simply have been taking time to just relax with myself which u told her but she seemed to light up somewhat I don’t know maybe I’m overreacting. I will edit with other things I can think of now that I’m on this topic but honestly I don’t remember much I haven’t given this much thought until finally now that it’s been mentioned I guess. I don’t know if I want this to go anywhere I’ve never gotten into relationships with co workers it’s never been my thing but I mean who knows seems interesting lol.

It's been quite the chaotic relationship. We started off with an open relationship as I'm not jealous at all and must say I quite like the idea that he had someone else to spend time with when I'm working crazy hours at times or work away from home for a few weeks a year. He started getting very insecure and jealous if I saw or spoke to someone else. So I decided to close the relationship and he happily excepted the new relationship dynamic. The problem with this whole situation is that I've been accused of cheating not stop since the beginning even though I haven't. Every time I don't answer my phone immediately or don't reply to a message fast enough I get accused of being with someone else. When he drinks he becomes very confrontational and start yelling at me and saying the most insane things. This last weekend was just the last straw that broke the camels back. I was accused of having a thing with my neighbors son whom is probably 15 years younger than me and I don't even know him. He just saw him looking into my backyard coming out their back door. I've even agreed to a tracking app on my phone to try and let him feel more secure. He is constantly checking if I'm online in WhatsApp and accuses me of chatting with other people. Even accusing me of that when I'm chatting with him. Wtf? Of course I'm gonna be online if I'm chatting with him.

The final straw was when he started rummaging through my house looking for so called evidence on the weekend during his last melt down. Accusing me of hiding some so called lingering which actually happened to be bra's where the wires started poking through that where packed in my fix it basket. I just chucked them out and my mom was actually standing next to me when i did this. Going through my phone and scrutinizing everything on there. He found nothing because there is nothing to find. Then having a meltdown when reading my private messages between me and my mom where she called him grumpy. After all this crazy I keep moving away to calm the situation and he just keeps carrying on and following me all over my house. He woke me up numerous time during the night to continue the fight. I told him he must get out in the morning because he drank way to much and can't drive in that state. 

How do I get this person out of my life. He keeps love bomming me after these episodes. I'm just broken and so hurt. I've been insulated so many times by his accusations and the most horrible things he says about my character and body. 

He will go drinking and show up outside my house. Every time I try get rid of him he starts yelling I'm leaving him for someone else. 

I just can't stand this behavior and just need this crazy to be over. I was so taken a back as I was told that at least he doesn't hit me. 

I'm  just so done. He makes such a mess of my bathrooms pucking and shitting and pissing everywhere and doesn't clean up. Can't even close the sugar and coffee after use. Just waists the food I prepare and pukes it out because he drank to much. Leaves the bedroom in a mess with food and drinks left all over. He has spoiled two of my birthdays with his shitty behavior and can't take him anywhere near my friends for visits because he gets jealous over stupid crap and then behaves rudely.

1qvruzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_wdwmagazine/comments/1qvruzb/im_a_rope_drop_expert_and_these_are_my_top_tips/,"I’m a Rope Drop Expert, and These Are My Top Tips for Magic Kingdom","[Photo by Judd Helms ](https://preview.redd.it/yx23g556yhhg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37a8cc0d4722153ce6a5d56e3212ccdb70660ef0)

***Want to rope drop Magic Kingdom? A Disney World expert is sharing their best tips on how to make the most of the experience.***

I’m an early riser even when I’m on vacation — and that’s crucial when I’m at Walt Disney World. If you want to experience each park’s hallmark attractions without standing in long lines in the heat (or shelling out for Lightning Lanes), you’ll need to rope drop, which means early mornings.

And if you’re rope dropping Magic Kingdom, the world’s most visited theme park, you’re going to need to get up *extra* early and have a plan to make the most of your experience.

# What Does Rope Drop Mean at Magic Kingdom?

Rope drop refers to arriving at a Disney park before official opening so you’re among the first guests allowed inside. At Magic Kingdom, rope drop is especially powerful thanks to [Early Theme Park Entry](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/early-theme-park-entry-disney-world/), which allows Disney resort guests to access select attractions 30 minutes before the general public.

[Photo by Laurie Sapp](https://preview.redd.it/edex4rmayhhg1.jpg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c484ab499beb27e49c0b95fff6ad99b104131e48)

Even without early entry, arriving early still gives you a major advantage once the rest of the park opens.

# Rope Drop Magic Kingdom Like a Pro

Here are my top tips if you’re hoping to rope drop Magic Kingdom and squeeze in as many rides as possible before the crowds start marching down Main Street.

# Get a Good Night’s Sleep Before Rope Dropping

Rope dropping Magic Kingdom means waking up early. If you don’t want your little ones to be cranky (and you don’t want to be cranky yourself), don’t stay up too late after the fireworks the night before. Grab a late-night snack, chug a glass of water, take a shower, and then lights out before 11.

# Have Breakfast and Coffee in the Hotel Room

Wake up early enough so that you can run to the food court in your hotel while the rest of your crew gets ready for the day. I love to pack my bag the night before and lay out all my clothes. I can quickly get dressed, grab my bag, and head down to get coffee and breakfast for everyone.

[Photo by Morgan Flaherty](https://preview.redd.it/tnbjwqhfyhhg1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56edacd28c3ca0eb71c6332f956eaf313e7486d0)

If you’re running behind, just grab something easy to take with you into the park (no need to head back to the hotel room). You can sip your coffee while riding the bus, boat, or Monorail.

# Line Up for Transportation Early

Assuming you’re staying on Disney Property, you’ll get [Early Entry](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/early-theme-park-entry-disney-world/) into Magic Kingdom. That’s 30 minutes before anyone else, even non-resort-guest passholders, are allowed into the park.

To get the most out of this precious time, you’ll want to be one of the first people through the Magic Kingdom gate. And to be at the front of the pack, you’ll want to be on the first bus (or Monorail, or boat) of the day.

[Photo by Laurie Sapp](https://preview.redd.it/203agzkiyhhg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=253ec1bbd48af0273459011b20670b8b001daf11)

Ask a Cast Member at your hotel what time transportation starts running, and if you’re up for it, line up at least 30 minutes before that time.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re staying at Disney’s Contemporary Resort, it’s usually faster to walk to Magic Kingdom than to take transportation.

# Pay Attention to the Cast Members at the Gate

When you rope drop Magic Kingdom, you’ll inevitably get stopped outside the gate. Lines will begin to form at each one of the entrance points. Do your best to get to the front of one of those lines (and ideally one to the side so that you can more easily go left or right under the train station as you enter).

[Photo by Laurie Sapp](https://preview.redd.it/6ya3pldmyhhg1.jpg?width=1030&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa96f9318769e0eeeac5e898033780bd01fd68b9)

If you aren’t near the front of a line, however, watch the Cast Members. Sometimes, they may magically open up a new line, and you’ll want to move quickly to get to the front of it.

Always be respectful of Cast Members. Say please and thank you, and remember to walk — yes, really — not run.

# Stay Together

When the Cast Members let you in, there will be a stampede down Main Street and to the hub. Here again, you’ll find that you’re stopped before you can get to any actual rides. Make sure your family stays together during this chaos. Put little ones in their stroller or hold their hands, and always have a meet-up spot in case you get separated.

# Have a Plan of Attack

As you walk down Main Street, don’t be tempted by the smells coming from Main Street Bakery. That’s what the early-morning coffee and breakfast in the hotel were for. Instead, stay focused on your goal: rope dropping Fantasyland or Tomorrowland.

[Photo by Cliff Wang](https://preview.redd.it/07hxkoppyhhg1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc7382979bfbc9cc25e0efc6aae5c8f8f36d0e8a)

Why those two? Right now, Magic Kingdom only opens these two lands for early entry. This is the best time to walk on Space Mountain or Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. Peter Pan’s Flight is also a good ride to rope drop because the queue is famously slow-moving once the day gets going.

If these three rides aren’t on your radar, you don’t need to be in such a hurry for rope drop. You could wait to rope drop Adventureland or Frontierland when the entirety of Magic Kingdom opens a half-hour later.

# Optimize Your Morning With the Rope Drop Guide App

The beauty of rope dropping is that you can get on to big rides without paying for Lightning Lanes through the My Disney Experience App. But there’s another app — the [Rope DropGuide app](https://app.ropedropguide.com/promo/Ropedrop) — that can make the most of your morning, and then some.

Use our Rope Drop Guide app (free to *WDW Magazine* and *DLR Magazine* members) to plan your day before you set foot in the park, so you know exactly where you need to be for your first, second, and even third rope-drop rides.

Plus, with forecasted wait times, you can make in-the-moment decisions about your next move at Magic Kingdom during rope drop. Knock out Space Mountain and planning to head to “it’s a small world”? Check the app first, and you might see that Peter Pan’s Flight is forecast to only get busier as the day goes on while “it’s a small world” will actually be less busy later. Time to change your plan of attack.

Rope Drop Guide isn’t only helpful with rope-drop mornings, either. You can use it to plan out your whole day, with access to menus, show times, ride info, and the AI-powered EP-B0T companion, who can help you make strategic decisions to make the most of your day. You can download the [Rope Drop Guide app](https://app.ropedropguide.com/promo/Ropedrop) here.

# Enjoy Less Popular Rides During the Peak of the Day

If you wipe out heavy hitters like Space Mountain and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train during early entry; snag Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain, and Haunted Mansion as soon as the rest of the park opens, you can spend the busiest time of the day simply chilling out.

[Photo by Cliff Wang](https://preview.redd.it/5hsegn92zhhg1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93c244a534d0903975e1d7e92f302f65353c206d)

Visit less-popular (but wonderful!) rides such as Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor or Mickey’s PhilharMagic. Stand in line for the Festival of Fantasy Parade or the castle stage show, grab a bite to eat at a sit-down restaurant, or spend time wandering through the highly themed lands, enjoying the atmosphere and Imagineering details. Now is even a good time to grab a nap and some pool time if you’re up for it (or need it).

# Be Ready for Evening Magic

Crowds will start to die down again in the evening. Some people who rope dropped but *didn’t* take it easy during the middle of the day may be wiped out and head back to their hotel. Some adults may park hop to other parks that serve alcoholic beverages. And many who stay in Magic Kingdom will begin lining up for fireworks as the sun sets.

[Photo by Judd Helms](https://preview.redd.it/hcdo3k08zhhg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8ddcecef545ee5953f53cbe8d320b5139b40400)

If fireworks are at the top of your list, you may also want to grab a spot for viewing at this time. I’m tall and generally don’t have a problem grabbing a last-minute spot for fireworks, but if you’ve got little ones with you, you may need to find a spot early. If fireworks aren’t on your radar, enjoy the short lines once again on some of your favorite attractions from earlier in the day — or any attractions you missed previously.

# Is Rope Dropping Magic Kingdom Worth It?

Rope dropping Magic Kingdom is a great way to experience so many popular attractions without long lines. Just remember to pack snacks, be courteous to Cast Members and fellow guests, drink lots of water, apply sunscreen liberally, and recognize when everyone needs a break.

And while Lightning Lanes and rope dropping can make it feel like you need to rush from one attraction to the next at Magic Kingdom, remember that much of the magical memories come from those in-between moments: your child eating their first Mickey bar, running into Peter Pan or the Stepsisters behind the castle, or noticing all the details along the river when riding the Liberty Square Riverboat. You can rope drop Magic Kingdom to do it all — but don’t forget to stop and *see* it all, too.

# Is rope drop at Magic Kingdom worth it with kids?

Yes , as long as you plan for breaks. Rope dropping with kids lets you experience popular attractions like Seven Dwarfs Mine Train or Peter Pan’s Flight with minimal waits, which can actually make the morning calmer and more enjoyable. The key is pacing: knock out must-do rides early, then slow down during the hottest and busiest parts of the day with shows, snacks, or a midday hotel break.

# What time should you arrive for rope drop at Magic Kingdom?

Plan to arrive at Magic Kingdom 45–60 minutes before Early Theme Park Entry begins if you’re staying at a Disney resort. This gives you time to clear security, tap in, and position yourself near the front of the crowd. If you don’t have early entry, arriving 30–45 minutes before official park opening can still put you ahead of the main rush.

# Which land should you rope drop first at Magic Kingdom?

Fantasyland or Tomorrowland are the best lands to rope drop at Magic Kingdom, especially during Early Theme Park Entry. Fantasyland is ideal if Seven Dwarfs Mine Train or Peter Pan’s Flight are top priorities, while Tomorrowland works well for Space Mountain. Adventureland and Frontierland don’t open until the rest of the park opens, making them better targets later in the morning.

# Is rope drop better than Lightning Lane at Magic Kingdom?

Rope drop and Lightning Lane work best together, but rope drop has the advantage of being free. By arriving early, you can experience top attractions with little to no wait before Lightning Lane return times even begin. Many guests find that rope dropping allows them to skip purchasing Lightning Lanes altogether or use them more strategically later in the day.

# What if you miss rope drop at Magic Kingdom?

Missing rope drop isn’t a dealbreaker. If you arrive later in the morning, focus on attractions with consistently lower waits, use Lightning Lane when available, and plan rides during parades, fireworks, or late in the evening. You can still have a great Magic Kingdom day; rope drop just makes it easier to get ahead early.",2,1770219622.0,u_wdwmagazine,0,1.0,False

WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance told a meeting of than 50 countries on Wednesday aimed at boosting access to critical minerals that the U.S. will establish a system creating price floors for the commodities.

Vance said the United States was proposing a trading bloc for critical minerals and many countries had already signed on to the plan.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

Today’s meeting in Washington — where Vice President J.D. Vance unveiled a proposed critical minerals trading bloc backed by more than 50 nations — represents a meaningful escalation in the global architecture around essential supply chains. By anchoring a system of price floors to stabilize markets and prevent dumping, the U.S. is signaling a shift from passive market participation to active structural intervention alongside allies. When viewed in concert with the recently launched Project Vault — the new Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve backed by EXIM and private capital — and bipartisan legislative proposals to expand funding for critical minerals security, this isn’t ad hoc policymaking. It’s the early outline of a coordinated allied industrial strategy aimed at diversifying supply, de-risking dependencies, and creating demand signals long enough and strong enough to support domestic project finance.

For U.S.-based developers like NioCorp, this broader policy backdrop changes the investing calculus. Initiatives like the trading bloc and price floor regime are designed to protect and **incentivize allied supply over foreign-dominated supply chains**, reducing the risk of foreign price undercutting and dumping — a perennial barrier to long-duration capital commitments in mining and processing. Combined with Project Vault’s explicit demand-backstop role, the global ministerial engagement unfolding this week reinforces the idea that domestic critical mineral projects will increasingly be evaluated not on spot-market cycles but as **strategic infrastructure** within an allied network. That dynamic elevates long-term contracts, structured offtakes, and sovereign-aligned investment — all of which align directly with where NioCorp’s Elk Creek platform is positioned to compete and contribute.

And here’s the part the market still isn’t pricing in: **NioCorp isn’t watching this unfold from the cheap seats — they’re already** in D.C. **near the rooms where it’s happening.** While the U.S. is building a critical minerals trade bloc, floating price floors, launching Project Vault with EXIM, and rallying 50+ nations into a new supply-chain alliance, **NioCorp is already tied into the exact institutions and mechanisms being activated** — EXIM, Traxys, U.S. industrial buyers, and the policy engine driving all of it. This is what “strategic” looks like in real time: the government is building the demand framework, the financing framework, and the protection framework… **and Elk Creek is one of the few U.S. projects positioned to plug into all three!!**

I was thinking of a cafe laundry matt hybrid. You could come and work on your laptop with some wifi while you wash, have comfier seating. We would sell coffee to make more money and the unique cozy environment would draw more clients. I think it could be a potentially charming third space and I've never seen anything like it.
My question is if there is any reason this would not work? Are there laws preventing food from being sold by cleaning supplies? Would it be too expensive? I only ever see laundry mats function solely for laundry so any experience in that business would be appreciated. I also live in long island and I could see this working either out here or in the city but again I don't know anything about business code or restrictions if anyone would be able to enlighten me.

For a little over a week, I started tracking everything I eat and how I feel (stress, brain fog, and pain on a 1–10 scale).

I go to the gym when I can and try to stay healthy, so I usually had boiled eggs for breakfast because they’re quick before work. And I noticed a pattern:

\- When I eat boiled eggs in the morning, my pain during the day is around 7–9.

\- When I eat something else (yogurt, salty snacks, fruit like strawberries or grapes), my pain is more like 2–4.

At first I thought it was coincidence, but it’s happened several times already (about 3 days with eggs and 4 days with other foods, mostly salty carbs and fruit).

Two days ago, after training, I got home in a rush and ate boiled eggs again at night. That same night a migraine started, I woke up the next day with a full migraine, and yesterday I felt awful all day. Even my medication (Nurtec) didn’t really help.

Today I woke up with a typical “migraine hangover.” I had yogurt + chia + blueberries for breakfast and later a coffee with no sugar, and so far I haven’t had any pain, just the usual blurry vision and that uncomfortable/off feeling you get the day after a migraine.

Could eggs really be one of my strongest migraine triggers?

Yesterday at the library, I pushed myself outside my comfort zone. I’ve spoken to my crush once before and it was positive, but asking her out directly felt overwhelming. Instead of avoiding it completely (which is what I usually do), I took a step forward in a way that felt manageable for me.

I spoke briefly with her friend earlier, then later gave her friend a short note asking if she could pass it along. The note simply said I’d like to take her out for coffee and that she could text me if she was interested.

Now I’m stuck in the overthinking loop replaying it, wondering if it looked weak, cringe, or showed a lack of confidence. Part of me is proud I didn’t freeze or avoid the situation, but another part of me is being really harsh on myself.

I’m trying to remind myself that progress with social anxiety isn’t about doing things perfectly, it’s about doing them *at all*. Still, the mental aftermath is tough.",3,1770219131.0,socialanxiety,1,1.0,False

She broke up with me about 1.5 months ago. She was pretty hostile at first but whenever we have messaged recently she seemed quite nice. I plan on leading the conversation to a really low pressure coffee invitation. I really hope it goes well. We are eachothers first bf/gf and i wanna try again. Not aiming to talk about anything deep with her , just light topics to open up our line of communication again.

The message i plan on sending is this:“Hey Liv, hope you’ve been doing well.Random question, do you know any good coffee spots like black sheep coffee (this is a memory we share) nearby? I’ve been meaning to try some nicer ones.”

If she responds well ill try give her an subtle invitation. If the message goes well ill request her on insta either after messaging or after meeting.

She had also viewed my tiktok profile after our most recent conversation , which she hadnt done before. If If you want more context on the break up look at my profile.

What do you think ?

update\* i ended up sending this message ""Hey Liv, hope you're well. I finished rayman legends earlier and it reminded me of when we used to play. It made me smile. What have you been up to ? ""

The conversation was pretty dry and just when i was about to react to her reply and end the conversation instead of dragging it out , she double messages saying she got a belly piercing and even sent a photo of it. Her replies became instant. I complimented her on it , and asked general questions about it. She then asked me about my new tattoo( why i got it etc etc) then she went dry soon after. I ended up reacting to her chat instead of dragging the conversation on too long.

Im thinking of messaging her again in 4 days, not sure exactly what. Maybe something about a bar she recommended i go before we broke up. I recently started going to after we ended things.

What do you all think ? Is there a chance shes interested in reconnecting ? Think its a good idea to message her in 4 days?

1qvrlwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1qvrlwu/my_gf_cheated_on_me_w_a_coworker/,My gf cheated on me w/ a co-worker,"Well, I'm not entirely sure how to start with this one, but 2025's been a difficult year for me. Sorry for the long read ahead.

Overwhelming grief and loss since I lost my dad unexpectedly from 2024 coupled with the big change by moving out of our family house to be with my partner. It's been great, I'm handling the adult stuff, but what 2025 brought me added to my own fall.

I've been crazy paranoid since the start of last year since my partner's been working the same company as I am, but she's stationed in a different location. Conflict of interest, is what they say. Now, I'm not usually the type of girlfriend to not trust my partner, but since this co-worker has been coming up a lot in our conversation, I started getting worried.

My partner's loving, we may not have a lot in common, but we made it work. I just noticed some changes whenever she comes home from work, she is always exhausted and we no longer have that shared time where we bond or just talk. Given our work, it really is draining, but she gets easily irritated when I ask her to do simple things just to help me with chores and she's always glued to her phone (which is technically mine since her phone got broken), but never replies fast to my messages. I also noticed that she's unusually active in social media, particularly Instagram.

Now on the other hand, this co-worker that she had was a nice, lanky fella, but I never met her, I just heard about her from what I get from my gf. Then, I just had this sudden gut feeling to check my partner's Instagram dms, she was talking to the same girl and asked her how she was during her shift, which I find normal since my partner's also the caring type of friend. Then after some time, I tried to check the dms again and found the conversation gone, I tried asking her about it but she just told me she usually declutters her dms, nothing special.

I trusted her, even though my instincts were up high. I then noticed she has been distant since and on one hot afternoon, it became an argument. She wasn't comfortable with me snooping around her social media. Privacy is something we both cherish and I admit that it was wrong for me to monitor all the time, but to my own dismay, the conversations they had never stopped. I also noticed that there was a shared post from the co-worker way back 2012 and out of snooping around, I noticed that my partner also shared the same post on her Facebook which I once again, tried to ask her about it, but she told me that it just randomly popped out of her feed and thought that the post seems nice, so she decided to re-share it on her feed. I paid it no mind, but I never forgot about it. Then, around Christmas time in 2024, she bough us couple windbreakers that were of the same pattern, but different colors. I loved it, but then I remember seeing her co-worker's featured stories where she was running outside. I noticed that we had the same type of windbreaker, but she had a different color. Again, I paid it no mind, but I usually never forget pattern, that's when my suspicion started skyrocketing.

After some time, on May 2025, I just got home from work and this gut feeling started kicking once again, my mind was asking me to check her phone while she was asleep. While I was snooping around, I found that there was a text message from her sister that seemed unfinished and I found it quite odd that they were speaking Tagalog, when she and her sister usually spoke in dialect. When she woke up that day, I asked her about it endlessly but all she said was perhaps her sister sent the message incorrectly to her. I wasn't convinced, so I pressed and she got mad about it and even pushed it further that if I was not convinced, just call the number.

I did the unthinkable of trying to ask her sister (using her Instagram) if the number was registered under her name. I confirmed it on the same day that it wasn't hers, so that's when I started calling the number. Much to my dismay, no one was answering and the texts aren't even being read. Then, I felt something inside me to just text the co-workers name to the number, mind you I didn't know who owns the number and I am just making plain guesses. After I texted the co-worker's name, that's when I got a response. I knew it, they were talking secretly and I confronted her about it and told her why she would lie about if she was only settling owed money with this co-worker, but then she just told me that she only did that because I knew I wouldn't be pleased or happy about their interaction. Fucking liar.

The time did its part and we got over that day, because I forgave her. Then it was the time that she already got promoted and she was given the right to work-from-home. I observed her when she works and even tried to memorize by key her password. Perhaps, that was my wrong move, I fucked around and found out that she was indeed cheating on me.

When I was in pain and we were in argument, she was quick to apologize and woo the co-worker and assured her that she wasn't causing the problems we have in the relationship. I also saw snippets of conversations she had with her work ""friends"" and badmouthed me for causing troubles when all I wanted was to talk. She never took accountability, doesn't even ask me how my day went in work or how was I feeling. I was only convenient when needed something.

On May 2025, her birthday was coming up and all she had in mind was the co-worker. When the co-worker would like to have something to eat, she used her last money just to get her food when my gf can't even give support to our house bills. I drowned in debt, because I saved her ass from starving and have fare on the way to work. I carried all the chores and bills, that I don't even know how I even survived exhaustion. I also found out that they even call each other by a slightly altered version of our pet name, DISGUSTING. They share coffee and go out of their way trying to swap seats with others just to be together. I even found out from one of the conversation she had with her work ""friend"", that they were also holding hands and talk privately when I am at work or they keep all conversations in their workspace.

When I found out on September 2025, the dates and time and what I was going through, all hell broke loose when realization hit me. I woke her up, not minding that she has work in a few hours, just to confront her about it. She excused that she only saw as a co-worker as a friend, more like a sister but she was acting like a high school girl to her friend when her little office girlfriend is around. I know what I saw and even have proofs of their conversations in Slack and Google Chat, but she still lied straight to my face. I had the option to hurt her, but it wasn't in my moral compass to go that low, but what progress I had for years from being clean of self-harm and almost 10 months of being nicotine-free were flushed down the drain. She apologized like an amateur and only said that she was going to make it up to me, but never apologized for what she made me feel.

What happened is already done, we are still staying together. If you'd ask me, if I didn't have to worry about the financial burden and house work she'll leave me with if we broke up, I would have ended it there and then, but I'm still here. Months have already gone by, but I have not moved on and this girl still haunts me during quiet times in the office. I even went out of there and got myself through therapy from the emotional damage, but nothing seems to work. I don't feel anything at this point, but it's an elephant in the room that's still weighing on my shoulders.",2,1770219057.0,CheatedOn,1,0.75,False

Comes in 90% of the time I’m working. I’m a 21 year old woman, I’d say this guy is late 30s - early 40s. When I first started serving him I thought he seemed totally normal, then one day I go to serve him as usual, I say hi and he says nothing.

He was just staring at me, it was extremely awkward. He obviously heard me so I ask him if he needed a minute to decide what he wanted. He says nothing and orders as normal. (Unimportant, but he has the weirdest order ever) At the end of the transaction I say bye and he just blurts out “you are so beautiful”.

I NEVER get compliments at work and don’t really expect it so I say thank you very awkwardly. The rest of the week he comes into the store every time I am working and it’s basically the same thing each day.

The cherry on the cake was when I was getting my lunch the other day. I came out of our back room to grab a coffee from a different shop, I noticed he was at the counter waiting to be served. I walk past him and he follows me to the other coffee shop.

He is making some really bland small talk but I was still feeling a bit weirded out by this. I was really trying my best to stay friendly tho. Once I get my coffee I say bye, but a a few minutes after my break was finished, he is at the counter again, waiting to be served.

I wasn’t feeling uncomfortable until that last interaction, I cannot tell if he is being nice/harmlessly flirty but is just wayyy too awkward to pull it off. I really do not mind when customers flirt with me, (it makes the shift more fun) but this guy is starting to feel a bit creepy.

Is it worth it to avoid this guy?? If I wanted to avoid him I’d have to let my manager know because at my store only 1 person is serving, the other one makes their orders. I am ALWAYS the one serving (I don’t like making the orders) so it would be very difficult to avoid him.

I’ve been debating whether to post this, but I guess I’m curious if anyone relates.

I always thought overthinking was just something that happened in my head. Like, yeah, I analyze stuff a lot, replay conversations, worry about the future… but I never realized how much it was affecting my body.

Lately, I feel tired all the time.  
 Not the “I need coffee” kind of tired — more like a deep exhaustion. My shoulders are tense, my chest feels tight, and even after sleeping, I wake up feeling like I already ran a marathon.

My brain just doesn’t slow down.  
 It’s constantly scanning for problems, mistakes, things I should fix, things that *might* go wrong. Even during calm moments, my mind feels alert for no reason.

What messes with me the most is the feeling of being disconnected.  
 Like everyone else is present in their lives, while I’m stuck inside my head observing, analyzing every move. Sometimes it honestly feels like I’m losing control — like my thoughts are in charge, not me.

For a long time I thought the solution was to “think less” or fight my thoughts, but that never worked. What helped was understanding *why* my mind was doing this and learning how to step back without forcing it.

I ended up writing something really simple for myself about this — just to get things out of my head and explain what actually helped me calm the loops. I didn’t plan to share it, but it’s helped a few people already.

If this post hits close to home and you want me to send it to you, feel free to DM me. No pressure at all.

Also curious — does overthinking drain your body like this too, or is it just me?

While looking around, I came across a few options that seem to bend the traditional format a bit: the Hip-Hop Ball (which surprised me in a good way), the Coffee Brewers’ Ball, and the Diversity Ball. They all sound interesting, but it’s hard to tell how they actually land if you haven’t been before.

For those who’ve gone to any of these or who understand the broader ball landscape better, what would you recommend for someone who wants the vibe and experience without needing to learn the waltz in short order? Any insight before I commit to a ticket would be appreciated.",3,1770218840.0,viennaExpats,0,1.0,False

We texted each other around 1pm, we then arranged to meet up: originally he told me 9-10pm would work for him and that he would find a spot for us to go to to have sexy time, I said okay cool let me know where I can meet you. 

9:30 comes around and he tells me he’s caught up and suggested we meet at 11 instead. I figured okay not a big deal, went to go get some gas, a coffee and cleaned my car out just to pass some time. 

11pm comes around we meet up, he gets in my car and tells me let’s go find a spot to park up. I said “didn’t you find one already? 

He said “no not yet” 

I said “okay do u have anywhere in mind?”

“He said no but we will find something”.  

20 mins go buy and either all of the spots we went to were private property or blocked off. I had then told him that we should’ve found a spot prior to leaving so we aren’t wasting time and gas driving all over. 

We found one parking lot against a fence, which happened to be some towing company so it was private property and they told us to remove our vehicle. (At this point we were just talking in the car we weren’t doing anything inappropriate). I then told him to try and find another place on the maps. He goes “no no I don’t need to look it up I know another place” 

He had me driving up and down town in circles, and every spot he had picked was either closed, blocked off or unavailable. 

Mind you the whole time he’s in my car, he’s complaining about the heat/ac, the music, then it’s make sure you leave the car running but turn your lights off, then my feet are cold turn the heat to shoot out where my feet are, then it’s oh let me drive your car please, then it’s can we watch a movie instead, then nvm I don’t want to watch a movie let’s just listen to music, then give me ur phone so I can change the music etc etc you guys get the vibe. 

At this point I had already asked him nicely to please just take a breather and stop going a mile a  minute. I also expressed that I felt like I’ve been wasting my time for the last hour especially since I was the one driving around. I said this could have all been avoided had we planned things out better. 

I then told him hey it’s 12:15 we’ve been driving back and forth for about an hour maybe it’s best we just call it a night. 

He goes no no I know another spot just bring us there 

We find the spot and it was actually empty thank god 

We get to doing what we’re doing and he tells me he’s tired and doesn’t want to continue to have sex but he wanted me to give him oral. I didn’t want to make a big deal so I just said okay and continued. (I’m already pissed asf) 

20 mins later he takes his phone and starts to record a video I got up and said: 

Me: “WOAH WHAT R U DOING????”

Him: “I’m just taking a video im not gonna show anyone” 

Me: “I don’t care you didn’t even as me for permission, you don’t just do that that’s not cool” 

Him: “idk why ur tweaking for it’s not a big deal” 

We started to get into a more heated argument, after going back and forth for a while I told him “okay enough now I think we should stop here, put ur pants back on we’re leaving right now, I’m dropping you back to your car”

He goes “What are u being for real” 

I said :” PUT UR PANTS BACK ON IM DONE, ALL NIGHT UR BITCHING AND COMPLAINING, UR WASTING BOTH OUR TIMES AND UR BEING COMPLETELY DISRESPECTFUL PUT UR PANTS ON WERE LEAVING RIGHT NOW” 

The whole ride back to his car I was completely silent while he was cussing me out….( dumb bitch this dumb bitch that etc) I dropped him back to his car he then proceeded to tell me he has no problem crashing into my car on the way out just to make more problems for me. 

slammed my car door so hard the whole thing shook and that was the end of that. 

Now without being said. I need to know WAS I WRONG for stopping our sexy time to drop him back to his car? Or do u guys think I was overreacting. Please share your honest opinions, I am open to whether I actually did mess up or not.

""Together, let's venture beyond the silence, into a world where every voice matters.""

*Adoption, touted as a gift, arrives wrapped in thorns that shred the adoptee's heart.*

Born in 1966 and adopted through South Africa's closed system, Elmarie Arnold carried a question she couldn't ask: *Who am I, really?*

Through **88 intimate snapshots**, she traces the paradoxes that shaped her life: from the darkest depths of trauma and despair to the soaring heights of joy and liberation. This is her journey from Marenda Koch (birth name) → Elmarie Coetzee (adopted) → the 52-year search to find her roots → and finally, fully, becoming **un-adoptically herself**.

**This memoir breaks the silence.**

The silence that says: *Be grateful it's not worse. Your silence will be greatly valued. We'll all feel better about what we did to you.*

I'm researching a frustration I keep running into: you know your best customers when you see them, but tools like Sales Navigator, Apollo, etc. are terrible at helping you find more of them.

Standard filters (industry, company size, job title) cast too wide a net or miss the companies you actually want. Your real ICP is more specific—maybe it's SaaS companies using a particular tech stack, businesses going through certain growth signals, or firms with specific operational patterns that don't show up in LinkedIn filters.

I'm working on [firmbase.co](http://firmbase.co) to solve this, but it's not ready for game time yet. Right now I just want to chat with 3-4 B2B founders/sales folks who:

* Know who their best customers are but struggle to find similar companies
* Waste hours filtering through irrelevant leads
* Feel like traditional prospecting tools don't capture what actually matters

For context I was a very shy and nerdy kid in school and I got bullied a lot( promise this is important) my friend Sophie 23F was my only friend in college she helped me get through it. Times when I wanted to give up she hyped me up told me it was all okay. The time I found out my mom died she held me. Lets continue. My boyfriend and I arrived at the reunion and sat down at a table everything was going good until I saw Sophie and the boy who bullied me all throughout college making out. For context he called me slurs and made fun of me for being black. At First I thought I was imagining things I thought maybe I was hallucinating because I had too many drinks but that wasn’t the case since I only had 1 drink. So I blinked trying to make sense out of this but no it was really her. I just ran to the bathroom and started sobbing. My boyfriend later texted me if everything was okay. I responded that I wanted to leave. He said that he was waiting in the car. I put some water on my face and went to the car. Later when we arrived home Sophie texted asking why I wasn’t there. I was honestly baffled. I texted back to meet me at the local  coffee shop at 3pm tomorrow. She didn’t respond but I didn’t care. I blocked her and deleted her contact. The next day I went to our local coffee shop and I saw her there. She tried to hug me but I gently pushed her away. I asked her why she was there with lets call him John. She tried denying it but I said I saw her she broke down sobbing saying I didn’t mean anything and that she didn’t want to hurt me and that she just loved him. I told her she could stay with him and that our friendship was done. She said I was going to regret that I didn’t know why yet but soon I was going to find out. Later I woke up with traitor spray painted across my car. I called the police and they said they couldn’t do anything since there wasn’t prove that she did this. I went inside and checked my insta to see she had told everyone I betrayed her and that I threatened her. I didn’t respond. A week later I heard the doorbell ring and I looked outside to see a letter. In the letter stood that she was pressing charges for theft. She said that I had stolen her family heirloom. And that she wanted to press charges for 20k dollars. I contacted my family’s lawyer and discussed my options he told me that I should keep it private and just wait. So I did exactly that. A day later a man dressed up in a suit told me I had to go to court in 2 days because of the theft charge . I closed the door and went to sleep again

1qvrbfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinalTapHorror/comments/1qvrbfq/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"“This can’t be right,” I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance.

I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

1qvralq,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1qvralq/hypothetical_would_you_rent_out_your/,[Hypothetical] Would you rent out your porch/veranda/backyard for a few hours? (Assignment research),"\[MOD team\]: I read the sub rules about post flairs but I am unable to add it while posting or later. Sorry!

Hey hosts! I’m working on a design assignment and would love your honest thoughts on a hypothetical concept.

The Idea:

What if Airbnb had a category where people could rent outdoor transitional spaces like porches, front yard, verandas, courtyards, backyard or covered patios for short durations (4-8 hours during the day)?

These are those “in-between” spaces that aren’t fully inside your home, but aren’t completely public either. The kind of spot where you might have your morning coffee, where neighbors stop by to chat, or where kids play in the evening. Well the chat/gossip with neighbours part is part of my lived experience in South Indian homes. But I noticed North American homes too have open yards where people just chill/hangout

Potential Use Cases:

People might book these spaces to:

\- Spend intentional time with elderly parents or old friends in a calm setting

\- Let kids practice music, dance, or art without disturbing apartment neighbors

\- Host small intimate gatherings (5-8 people max) without the formality of a restaurant

\- Have a quiet place to work or read that’s not a café

\- Celebrate small moments (birthdays, anniversaries) in a homey, non-commercial space

It is not for: parties, events, meetings, commercial shoots (maybe small unobtrusive shoots are okay), or anything loud/disruptive.

My Questions for Hosts:

1. Would you consider this for:∙Your own home where you live?∙A dedicated Airbnb property (maybe during turnover days when cleaning happens, or off-season)?∙Both? Neither?
2. Trust & Safety concerns? What would worry you about having strangers in your outdoor space for a few hours?
3. Privacy boundaries? Would you be home during the booking? How would you handle bathroom access, parking, entry/exit?
4. What would you need to feel comfortable? (Screening, rules, insurance, reviews, deposit?)

6. Operational logistics? For those with Airbnb properties: Could this work between guest bookings? During cleaning hours? As filler income during slow seasons?
7. Cultural/social concerns? Would neighbors think it’s weird? Any stigma around having people come and go for short periods?

∙ I’m exploring whether “time-based” bookings for semi-private spaces could work

Standard filters (industry, company size, job title) cast too wide a net or miss the companies you actually want. Your real ICP is more specific - maybe it's SaaS companies using a particular tech stack, businesses going through certain growth signals, or firms with specific operational patterns that don't show up in LinkedIn filters.

I was thinking of coming on here for advice for years and I didn’t have the courage until  now. I’m not even sure if this is the correct sub for this. This is a quite lengthy life situation so please tag along and let me know what I should do.

**TL;DR:**

I’m a 24-year-old first-generation college student who feels extremely behind in life. I moved far away for community college to escape strict parents, but the sudden freedom and lack of guidance led to poor grades, failed classes, academic probation, and a lot of regret. I eventually discovered my passion for PR/marketing and built an impressive resume through internships, networking, and real industry experience. Agencies have shown interest in hiring me, but not having a degree is now holding me back.

Even though I’m highly motivated and successful when it comes to work, I feel stuck and paralyzed when it comes to school. I struggle to re-enroll or transfer, and I carry a lot of shame around being “behind.” I’ve been lying to everyone in my life about still being in school, which has caused intense anxiety, guilt, and isolation. I constantly compare myself to peers who have graduated and feel like I did everything backwards. The idea of not finishing school until 28 makes me feel like a failure, and I’m asking for advice on how to move forward and finally get unstuck.

**FULL STORY**

For some context Im currently a 24 year old girl, feeling beyond lost in life and feeling like time is passing and im a failure who’s behind. SO behind that I can’t even take control of my life to continue as much as I want to. Im gonna break it up in parts so it’s not a big wordy paragraph in hopes of it being clear and not confusing.

Im a first generation college student, my family and I moved to the states when I was around 10. I had to learn the language and take all the responbility of paper work/documents/etc for my parents. Throughout high school they were beyond strict with me, I was never allowed to see friends, go out, or have fun. As the question of college was coming closer, I had no guidance from them. To be honest with everyone, I had no idea what college even was supposed to be like until end of junior year. I knew I had to apply, I had alright grades but I had no idea what I wanted to do in the future, where I wanted to go to college or anything. There was a college trip my high school took which my parents didn’t let me go to. To this day I look back at that and feel like I put the entire blame on them for how my college years turned out bc I was so sheltered and didn’t know what I was going into. I decided to move 7 hours away in my state to a community college where I would then transfer to a top university in my state. My parents supported my decision paid for my housing and the rest was covered by aid. A big reason why I chose to move away, as you can guess was to get away from my parents and have freedom. Unfortunately me having all this freedom after practically living at home jail didn’t mix well. I became so thrilled with my free will I started going out almost everyday, taking plans with people no matter the school work I had and eventually that all reflected in my grades. I spent 2 years majoring in a major I secretly hated, but I knew nothing about myself or what I wanted to do. After I decided to change my major to something within the communications world because that felt more me. I will get into more of that in the next paragraph. I did about 2 years at the CC after failing almost all of my classes I realized the rural city I was living in was not for me and I wanted to move back home. I had ZERO sense of what I should have been doing, I wish I had the guidance of someone telling me to do XYZ and I think I have a lot of anger within myself for not doing better. I decided to move back and continue online. I have SO much regret for moving so far away, wasting my parents money on rent and realistically getting nowhere. However, if I never moved away my relationship with my parents would’ve been AWFUL. The only bright side of moving away was that my parents gave me more freedom, more respect, and I truly saw our relationship flourish and become what I always wish it was. For the last few years I can’t help but to think what would’ve happened if I just didn’t move away and went to a good 4 year near me that I was accepted to, but I guess everything happens for a reason and my choices have got me where I am.

I’ve always wondered why I didn’t have the same drive for school that I did for work. I had been working since I was 15, doing small jobs like babysitting and helping kids with homework. Then when I was 17 I started working retail. I was in the retail space for about 6 years. Even when I was in college I was also working part time. I was and still am a major go getter and hustler. When I moved back home from college I was attempting to do online classes as well work. However I felt so depressed from the fact that I had wasted 2 years majoring In something I did not want to do that I took a gap year which turned into probably 2. After I moved home I was DETERMINED to find what I wanted to major in and work for something I was passionate about. I cold emailed over 100 pr/marketing agencies to get a remote internship to see if that’s what I wanted to do. I landed my first remote pr internship, it was unpaid but I was still working at my retail store so I was managing just fine. I always preferred work to school and I never understood how and why someone who was such a go getter couldn’t find it within to finish or continue school. After I wrapped up my internship I got an in person one at an amazing luxury boutique agency. I was working 30+ hours throughout 4 days and the other 3 days I was interning. I did this for about 6 months. I had no off days and I was pushing myself to make connections within the industry. After my second internship wrapped up I tried to get back into school and take one online class while I juggled everything else. I had opportunities I could never even imagine. I was flown out to a major city for major events to do production/pr for them, and this time it was paying. When I got back I landed my best internship with a global agency that I could have never imagined I even got. The only reason I got this was because I actually met the hiring director at my retail job and she gave me the contacts and set up the interviews for me. At this point I felt like even my retail job was great for reason, I was in the industry I loved and I was making connections that were helping me for my career. I started my internship again where I was basically working 7 days a week with no off days. This last internship truly set it in stone for me that the one thing to make me a qualified candidate I needed a degree. at my last day of the internship I had a exit coffee chat where the head of the office told me that she had not seen someone my age ( 23 at the time) have such a packed and impressive resume. For the PR/marketing field I knew she was right because I had people from high 4 year universities reaching out to me for advice. She told me once I graduate I have nothing to worry about and will be hired immediately for the position I apply for. About 2 weeks ago I actually  freelanced with the same agency, and they asked when I was graduating since a position had opened up. My heart felt so heavy knowing if I had taken all the right steps I could have had my dream job.

Me not being able to get back in school has affected me in ways I can’t even tell all of you. It’s like I know the right thing I have to do but I can’t get myself to do it. I was on academic probation for failing my classes, even after I got off I felt like I couldn’t get myself to go into the portal and register myself for the classes. Even now I can’t get myself to transfer to a different community college to see if I can get this traumatizing feeling of doom off my chest. I feel so stupid so behind that I was supposed to be graduated and im still “in school”. I graduated high school in 2021 so I’ve basically spent 5 years wasting my life. I know that’s not true and I have accomplished a lot but I havant accomplished the one main thing I was supposed to. It breaks my heart knowing that people who I didn’t think were capable graduated college and I didn’t. I know Im capable bc I’ve been able to do everything else I’ve done but I just can’t do this. I feel like I’ve been doing everything backwards, I’ve done the internships, I’ve done the networking, I’ve done the work, I have the savings, I have traveled the world. But I still can’t do what I know will make my parents proud. The worst part of this situation is that no one knows. I mean NO ONE, you guys are the first ppl to know this. Ive been lying to my friends, my parents, my family, my boyfriend. This situation has given me so much anxiety over the years that I’ve refused to hang out with friends because I dont want them asking me about school about my plans, when my family asks I have to keep lying and its one of the worst secrets I’ve had to keep. I constantly feel heavy, im constantly anxious, when I go to bed all I can think of is how much of a failure I am and how much time I wasted. I have heart palpitations when I think of my future and honestly I’ve wondered if it’s even worthy of living because of how behind I am. Ive never talked to anyone about this, I’ve just attempted to tru to keep going myself but I feel like I need second opinions. It’s been beyond difficult watching my friends and those around me graduating college, moving onto doing masters and im still in community college.

I can’t help to think if I didn’t move away, if I finished school on time, by this time now I would’ve secured my dream job, I could’ve completed the next step in potentially being engaged. But even if I start now, I won’t finish school until im 28 which is pathetic of me. Im sorry for the long text, but I do hope you guys read it and give me some good advice on what I should do.

I cut my customer acquisition cost by 60% using this system 📈,"Sick of gurus telling you to ""just scale"" your business without any actual roadmap? I was there, too. For years, I listened to the hype, until I stopped trying to 'hack' growth and focused on what actually works for my small B2B service business. We went from a pretty inconsistent $10-12k MRR to consistently hitting $30-35k MRR in about 18 months. It wasn't glamorous, but it was real and repeatable.

Here's how we did it, focusing specifically on **scaling client acquisition for a service business** (we build custom software integrations for mid-sized companies):

*   **The Problem:** We were relying heavily on inbound leads from our website, which were sporadic and often not a great fit. My personal network was tapped out.
*   **The Shift: Strategic Partnerships (80% of our growth)**
    *   **Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Research & Outreach.** I dedicated about 10 hours a week to identifying complementary businesses (e.g., digital marketing agencies, business consultants, IT firms) who served our ideal client but didn't offer our specific integration services.
    *   **Phase 2 (Months 3-12): Building Relationships.** I focused on *genuine* relationship building. No hard sells. I'd offer to consult for their clients on integration issues for free, co-host webinars, or simply meet for coffee (virtually during the pandemic). We structured a simple, transparent referral commission: 10% of the first project's value, paid upon project completion.
    *   **The Numbers:**
        *   From ~2-3 qualified leads/month from our website, we increased to **6-8 highly qualified leads/month** primarily from partnerships.
        *   Our close rate for these partnership leads jumped from ~15% (for inbound) to **over 40%**.
        *   Average project value increased by about 25% because partners often pre-qualified clients better.
        *   **Cost:** Minimal upfront. My time, a small budget for coffee/lunches (~$100/month), and the referral commissions (paid *after* revenue comes in). We also invested in a basic CRM ($50/month) to track these relationships properly.
*   **Refining Our Sales Process (20% of our growth)**
    *   We overhauled our proposal template to be less about us and more about the client's problem and our specific solution.
    *   Implemented a mandatory discovery call process to qualify leads aggressively early on, saving wasted time.
    *   **Result:** Reduced time spent on unqualified leads by roughly 30% and significantly improved our proposal-to-close ratio across the board.

**Real Talk & Challenges:**

This wasn't an overnight success. Building those partnerships took *months* of consistent effort without seeing a dime. I had countless initial meetings that went nowhere. Some potential partners looked great on paper but turned out to be flakes or not a good fit culturally. I also spent a lot of time refining my pitch to partners, explaining how we could genuinely add value to *their* clients, not just asking for referrals.

Hiring our first dedicated project manager (~$5k/month salary) was a huge leap of faith during this scaling phase, and it put significant pressure on our cash flow until new clients started flowing consistently. There were definitely moments of doubt, wondering if I was just wasting my time and money. It's not about 'passive income' when you're growing; it's about pushing harder than you thought possible, learning from what doesn't work, and doubling down on what does.

1qvr5vd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qvr5vd/did_i_do_anything_wrong/,Did I do anything wrong?,"Hi everyone,

I guess I’m just looking for second opinions on where things went to wrong so I can self-correct for the future.

Around 1 1/2 - 2 months ago I started talking to someone (29M) long distance. Didn’t really think much of it but we connected pretty fast, talked about my hobbies his work and his own company. I’ve had my share of pretty bad relationships and I am typically reserved…but we were on the phone 8-12 hours daily and it became part of my routine and we talked about traumas, relationships, etc and I quickly let my guard down. He would plan the future, say he would move closer, say we were basically in a relationship etc. I did mention in the beginning that I was working on a lot of triggers and needed patience as I dealt with it and he agreed to reassure me etc. throughout our conversations he mentioned we were dating and confirmed we were exclusive. Now, he did mention sometimes in the phone that I was clingy but he loved it, I’m not sure how. Maybe that’s just something I need to analyze more as I was never the one to call him first or get upset if he didn’t text me etc, I just did ask for reassurance once because of a girl he had followed but apologized for it and that was it.

Fast forward to this weekend, we decide it’s time to meet up in person and he flies out. I plan the weekend and we met up. He’s sick so we cannot do anything I planned, but I’m fine with it. I’m more worried about how sick he is and I’m asking him if I can do anything for him and hugging him/holding his hand…but he seems dismissive or reserved so I back off a little. The next day he is still sick so we cannot do anything I planned which I’m fine with. We did go out to eat and it was fine but he did mention his first thing that I guess caught me off guard. He said he didn’t see talking on the phone as “real” that he was more of an in person guy which threw me back a little because I had invested so many hours (I work and go to grad school full time) so I definitely thought it was real. When we got back home he was still sick so we stayed home and I was hugging him and trying to be affectionate asking also if I could do anything to help him and he seemed hesitated so I backed off. Later I asked if he was sure he liked me and that it was fine if not but I was feeling dismissed, he said he did like me and that he’s just reserved so I let it go. However, later that night he mentioned I was clingy and joked about how he was the opposite. I tried to kiss him here and there but he seemed hesitant so I stopped trying. Throughout the trip he complained about how much he works, how much he has to pay for his family/himself and gave me amounts. Told me about all his dramas and I don’t know how to explain it but it was very transactional, most of his friendships were at the gym and he bragged about how they all used to work for him at some point. Talked about how people always screw him over, use him for money, etc. I expressed I didn’t want anything transactional and just wanted to help him and provide emotional support. Sunday he was getting bombarded with work emails and I asked him if he needed to work and he said no it’s fine so we finally went out. We genuinely had a good time, he seemed happy, at some point he would take work calls but nothing too much. At some point he got sick again so we went home and he seemed less reserve and affectionate, however, he joked again that I was clingy and we were opposite.

Monday is when everything kinda went to shambles. He worked a little that day and then after we left our place and I suggested we go to a coffee shop he said he hated coffee shops and since he had so much work he would rather get an earlier flight. I said ok and we went to the airport, as he was getting ready to leave he apologized for the experience and I mentioned I was not bothered by it at all and that o was just happy I got to see him. He mentioned coming back to plan something better and he said he wouldn’t be able to see me for four months because of work. I said I understand and wouldn’t want to put any pressure on him and that I would wait on him but needed him to clarify where we were going or what we were if I was going to wait on him and he said he couldn’t give me an answer because he needed to get his life together and that he would give me an answer after he fixed his problems and reassured me he wouldn’t waste my time and expressed that I again was clingy, wanted a full-blown relationship and that because of his dramas and bad friendships/relationships he was reserved. I told him that answer didn’t satisfy me and he just kept repeating the same things so I said it was better if he just boarded his plane and I left as I was getting emotional.

We didn’t talk all that day and the next day I noticed he blocked me everywhere, so I sent him a message and asked him to clarify jf we were done and asked what the cause was. He basically said he didn’t like me, that I was clingy and that he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship because of his family/work an we left it at that.

To be honest, I was sad but if anything I’m relieved it’s over, it was too negative/transactional. However, I’m going to talk to my therapist about it but I am self-reflecting to see if I did anything pushy? I don’t want to repeat any mistakes. Did I ask for too much?

First I want to start by saying this is not my first rodeo with calorie deficits, I lost 35lbs over the course of 14 months using a calorie deficit and regular exercise. Last summer life hit me pretty hard and I completely stopped paying attention to my eating and was very RARELY working out, because of this I gained back 15lbs. Now starting the new year I've really been trying to get back into consistency, I've been eating in a calorie deficit for about a month while also lifting 3x/week. I'm averaging 7-8k steps a day (I know this should be higher but the beginning of the year is really busy at work and my walking pad stopped working).

In the beginning I saw the occasional small weight increase due to DOMS/holding water and my body adjusting, but over the last month it all averaged out to losing 1-1.5lbs/week. Starting this week it's been the complete opposite, every morning weigh in has just been getting higher and higher. Before anyone brings it up, yes I have a food scale and yes I weigh and track absolutely everything (except my morning coffee because I drink it black, never any cream or sugar). Also if anything, this previous weekend was more walking and less food centered than usual.

For food tracking, the main things I'm focusing on is hitting my calorie, protein, and fiber targets: 1700cal, 120g protein, 25-30g fiber. Also being mindful of fats and carbs so my diet is balanced but much less strict on those. I've drank alcohol maybe twice over the past month but pre-calculated it into my daily meal plan so I wasn't exceeding my calories by a ton. I've weight lifted for years so not concerned about what I'm doing in the gym and including incline treadmill walks some days when I can.

She had also viewed my tiktok profile after our most recent conversation , which she hadnt done before. If If you want more context on the break up look at my profile.

What do you think ?

update\* i ended up sending this message ""Hey Liv, hope you're well. I finished rayman legends earlier and it reminded me of when we used to play. It made me smile. What have you been up to ? ""

The conversation was pretty dry and just when i was about to react to her reply and end the conversation instead of dragging it out , she double messages saying she got a belly piercing and even sent a photo of it. Her replies became instant. I complimented her on it , and asked general questions about it. She then asked me about my new tattoo( why i got it etc etc) then she went dry soon after. I ended up reacting to her chat instead of dragging the conversation on too long.

Im thinking of messaging her again in 4 days, not sure exactly what. Maybe something about a bar she recommended i go before we broke up. I recently started going to after we ended things.

* I like talking about anything and everything. I enjoy learning new things (**purely SFW**) ~~but rest assured it doesn't have to be serious knowledge. For example, I somehow ended up researching the lineup McDonald's mascots and their stories because of a friend from here HAHA~~
* I'm a creative, so we can be delulu together.
* ZERO TOLERANCE to sad boy/girl. We can talk about traumas, coping mechanisms, and life lessons from them. BUT NO TO TRAUMA DUMPING. ~~Stressed din ako. lol~~
* NO to discussions about politics and religion. We can still be friends and respect each without going through that debate.
* I don't force conversations. I'm not a weightlifter.

You:

* Just be respectful of boundaries and be kind.
* May sense of humor.
* ± 3 years so we can share sentiments.
* Can actually converse and banter.

If you're down to chat, hmu. Who knows, if we vibe and maintain a stress-free and low maintenance friendship, we can even grab coffee at some point?

1qvqztl,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1qvqztl/the_unique_struggles_of_life/,The unique struggles of life,"Forgive me for my grammar, I never payed attention in English class. 

I want to start off with who I am. I’m a hard worker, I love learning and improving, I love teaching and helping others, I love competing, I love protecting people from the things that have hurt me or others in the past. 

I don’t believe this makes me special or better than anyone. I believe it means I have more of a responsibility. It’s a self perceived expectation of who I need to be, because I know I can be, for the people that are special to me. 

But now I’m struggling to be this person.

I live in a dysfunctional house. My mom who sucks at being an adult and my brother who’s half retarded because of his epilepsy causing memory issues and his lifestyle of avoiding sobriety, learning or stimulating the mind. 

My mom consistently talks about doing things and just doesn’t do them. For example: “I bought this new thing to help my back” “I bought this because it’s healthy” “I need to clean that, I’ll do it later”. None of it ever helps because she’ll by the back massager but won’t stretch or exercise so what’s the point? You bought supplements for brain fog and cramps. Ever thought about less screen time, healthy food, avoiding stress late at night to get better sleep, and then topping it off with a good stretch and strong breakfast? You get the point.

You are probably rightfully thinking “her husband passed away give her grace” I’ve done nothing but try to understand her situation and be there for her and my brother. I’ll spend hours cleaning up the mess they made, just for it to be ruined the next day. If I dont leave everything spotless though I get yapped at, my favorite example cause it happens often is: doing the dishes even the pots pans and bowls the left out from last nights dinner that should’ve been cleaned then. And the being bitched at because I left coffee grounds in the sink. You can spend 30 mins cleaning but god forbid you forget to clean out the sink. But they can leave as big of a mess as they want “I’ll do it later!” 

It’s like my mom forgot how to live, she spends all her time stressing about work and life that she’s forgetting how to live and too cope she latches onto what makes her feel better. Food, family. But the foods not good for her and the family can’t help you when all you do is wear a mask to pretend your doing a good job and when you always want to be the one in control, won’t listen, won’t accept you may be wrong in some areas, blame others, focus on the negative. 

Basically my mom has horrible decision making skills, won’t listen to advice, digs herself a hole, then cries about the hole and refuses the rope to pull her out. 

She needs diet, sun, exercise, less screen time, and to get rid of her damn ego.

Next is my brother. He has memory issues, no license because DUI so he’s stuck at home, our personalities our VERY different and I feel pressured to spend time with him, I can’t bear the thought of my brother suffering alone. I like to listen to people, ask questions, understand. I’m not much of a talker I like to listen, throw in jokes when I can and hopefully offer something constructive. Hell talk any opportunity he gets, about anything and also repeat himself at least 3 times while he does it and even if he asks you a question he’ll cut you off to keep speaking. Extremely frustrating to me.

 

Im scared of losing myself in this house. This house has left me angry, isolated, anxious, insecure. Because I don’t know what my day looks like. Will my brother have a seizure today? Will he get drunk and belligerent today? Is mom hating her life or is she in the best mood in the world for no reason? Will the house be a wreck when I get home? Where things be where I left them? Will someone be angry at me when I walk through this door? Will they be talking about drama that this house has enough of? 

I know the fact that I can see or at least try to understand all of this mean that in some capacity it’s my fault being in the position I’m in because it means I could’ve done a better job. But I ran. I smoked, vaped and retreated to work music and exercise

I dont know what to do, I want to be happy, I want to have a purpose, to connect. I want to help people but feel worthless because I’ve been surrounded by people I can’t help even if I give the right answers. ",1,1770217662.0,helpme,0,1.0,False

I wasn't that into her until I really met her. We would hang out every two days for months. We never kissed, we just hung out and sometimes cuddled. She always told me she needed a little more time before we could be a thing. I noticed she would always go to secluded places where not many people could see us, and always when it worked for her. We would text 24/7, mind you im not a texter, I hated texting. I only use texts on Instagram for arranging plans and basic levels of contact, but with her, there was nothing than i wanted more than to always be in contact with her. We would talk on the phone for hours. After about two months of this, I had enough. And I asked what was going on, are we ever gonna be a thing, and we got into a fight and stopped talking. She gaslit me into it being my fault. For weeks i had been a wreck until I met a girl who happened to know her. I told her our story, and she was shocked. Why, you ask? Because during the 2 months we spent, she was already seeing someone. Yeah, Pathetic on my side, I know.

 4 months have passed until this November. Where we would accidentally meet again at a rock club we both liked to go to. We had a great conversation, as nothing had happened before. A week later, she would contact me, wanting to see if I wanted to hang out. We hung out a little bit, but nothing happened. Later that same day, she would contact me again to tell me she would like to tell me some stuff she didn't have the balls to tell me earlier that same day. And I agreed. When we met, she apologized for hurting me that summer and said that she really wanted me to forgive her. I said okey but before I forgive you. I would like you to tell me, during the summer we hung out, were you seeing someone? (If she had said no, I would've just stood up and left) But she said yes and accepted the apology. I asked her if that was all. She said no. Started tearing up and frantically asking me if we could try being again. I told her I needed to think about it. After about a week, I gave in. And start a relationship with her. We had a great 2 months. I had some issues. Like on weekends when both of us were going out. She would know where I was. And she would be in a coffee place or party place just 50 meters away. And she never felt like she should contact me just to say hi or see me for like 15 minutes or so. I ignored this, but was in reserve about it. But after it happened about 5 times i decided that we should talk about it.

 2 days ago i texted her. Hey, can we meet tomorrow? I wanted to talk about something that's been bothering me and that I wanted to work out so we could have an even better relationship and be even happier together. She blew that text out of proportion and got angry at me, and didn't want to talk to me for the rest of the night. When we meet tomorrow at her house (which seemed like a good sign to me cause it didn't seem like you would break up with someone at your home). She would frantically yell at me about what kind of messages these were. You sent them like we were having a divorce and fighting for custody. I said no, I was just wanting to talk about some of my insecurities with you, so we can have a better relationship. But she didn't want to hear it. I told calm down lets talk about this like adults. And fix this silly issue. She said that she had cried and almost had a mental break the night before and that she couldn't go through that again. Not with my mind, you. She never thought she would have stress like this in a barely 2-month-long relationship. I asked her if she's willing to throw away 2 months of a beautiful relationship for a simple misunderstanding. She said it wasn't wonderful for her (which contradicts the messages she sent before, how she had a great time with me, how she's never had such a calming relationship, and such.) She said that she decided it was over. I was utterly shocked. I asked her, even though you manipulate,d lie,d and took me for a ride this summer i still gave you a second chance, dont i deserve the same. She said dont be pathetic.  I stood up, thanked her for everything, and left. Came home, deleted all our pictures, and all the gifts she had given me.  Because it is finally over. My whole Arc with the first girl I've ever fallen in love with has ended. Mind you im 28 and have had a couple of relationships before. I would like any opinion, advice, or support about my situation. Since nothing hurt this much before. Not a single thing.",5,1770217516.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

A while back, I decided I wanted a more control over my Lelit MaraX because I really think it is a cool machine but I am also really envious of all the Decent machines. I started with a shot-timer, then added a pressure mod and in the end I quite fell down a rabbit hole

Fast forward to today, and I’ve completely replaced the brain of the machine. I’m calling it the \*\*MaraX Evolution\*\*. It’s a full hardware and software overhaul that turns this humble heat-exchanger machine into something that rivals machines 3x the price.

[landing page of the HMI device. Pressure temperatures and weight are displayed here](https://preview.redd.it/qtuca0icthhg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=79c36b72c5a40f8bcd86a74120a37affe2c2f911)

[The profiling in action \(here for simplicity with a blind flange\)](https://reddit.com/link/1qvqxga/video/hced2gcothhg1/player)

The machine can do anything the stock firmware can (boiler refill etc...) but additionally built a custom PCB based on an ESP32 that gives me:

\* Pressure Profiling: I can control the pump power in real-time (via a dimmer mod) to do long pre-infusions or declining pressure shots.

\* Flow Profiling: I designed a custom \*\*Scale\*\* that fits \*inside\* the drip tray. The machine reads the weight in real-time and adjusts the pump to hit a specific flow rate (e.g., maintain 2.5g/s).

\* Feed-Forward PID: Standard PIDs react to temp changes. This one predicts them based on the boiler physics, making it much more stable than the stock one.

\* Touchscreen HMI: I added a HMI device that sits in a custom 3D printed housing next to the coffee machine. I can graph the shot live, change profiles, and adjust settings without opening the machine.

\* WiFi & Home Assistant: Because if my coffee machine isn’t on my local network, does it even exist?

I’m not selling kits. I’ve published everything—the PCB schematics (KiCad), the 3D print files (STLs), and the firmware code—on GitHub. If you’re handy with a soldering iron and not afraid of voiding your warranty, you can build this.

\* **Main Controller**: [https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution](https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution)

\* **HMI/Screen:** [https://github.com/andia89/maraxevolution-hmi](https://github.com/andia89/maraxevolution-hmi)

\* **Scale:** [https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution-Scale/](https://github.com/andia89/MaraXEvolution-Scale/)

Honestly, I had way too much fun doing this. I want to do it again with a different machine (maybe a Marzocco? another Lelit (Bianca)). I’ve set up a way for the community to vote on which machine I should reverse-engineer next—check the GitHub readme if you want to chip in on that.

It hurt, but I cut contact and moved on.

A few weeks ago she randomly reached out, saying she’d been thinking about me. We started hanging out again casually — coffee, talking, nothing official — and she seemed genuinely remorseful. I thought maybe she wanted some kind of closure or to make things right.

Then one night she asked if I’d be open to a threesome.

I won’t lie — I assumed she meant two women. I didn’t push details, but I agreed, thinking it was just a fantasy thing and not that deep.

The day comes… and she shows up with him.

The same guy she cheated on me with while we were together.

I was completely blindsided. I asked her if she was serious and she said she thought “facing it together” might help me heal, and that it could be a way for us to “close the loop.” The guy just stood there awkwardly saying nothing.

I snapped. I told her this was manipulative, cruel, and that she crossed a line. I left immediately and told her not to contact me again.

She later messaged me saying I overreacted, that I’m insecure, and that I “ruined something that could’ve been freeing and mature.” A couple of mutual friends think I should’ve handled it more calmly instead of blowing up.

Now I’m wondering — am I actually overreacting here, or was this as messed up as it felt in the moment?

Weight loss can be fun. If I take it too seriously. I’ll feel like a failure. I allow myself tasty morsels without resentment.

I can still enjoy the foods I had. Weight loss isn’t boring. I just make minor adjustments for my goals. High protein/fiber bread and tortillas. Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. 1% fat milk in my coffee Air frying. Reduced fat cheese. Jams with no added sugar, etc.

I learned to cook. Google is a powerful tool. Now I cook as a love language. For others, but especially myself.

I plan ahead. I know what I want before going to the grocery store. I eat before the grocery store. I go to the same store 90% of the time so I know my route while avoiding temptation. I plan what my meals are for the week before going to the store to avoid purchases against my goals.

It’s okay to go out to eat with friends. I look at the menu beforehand. I say no to things that aren’t within my goals. I say yes to fries or dessert if it fits my budget.

Alcohol pauses the body’s fat burning process, and dang it chips sound really good when you’ve had a couple.

I prioritize nutrient dense foods and enjoy treats regularly. I just enjoy them in moderation. If I swear off of anything, I likely set myself up for a shame cycle and go crazy. Have some empathy for yourself. That cookie won’t kill you. If you have the cookie, you aren’t off track.

Calories in matter more than calories burned, but a regular exercise routine promotes more than just weight loss. It improves overall health, physical emotions and mental.

Diets are manageable for short term goals. I had to change my thoughts, behaviors and relationship with food if I want to maintain long term goals. I no longer obsess over intermittent fasting, keto, fat burning supplements. I rewired food to be my energy source, not a luxury.

I try to get 7 hours of sleep a night. This really does matter.

I tracked my macronutrients consistently for a long time, but don’t do it as much anymore. It shouldn’t be an obsession, but now that I have my baseline I know what I’m eating as long as it’s scheduled and regularly observed.

Carbs aren’t scary. They’re necessary for energy. Fats aren’t scary. Healthy fats improve my brain function. Include them in your diet regularly.

If I practice kindness towards myself, my weight loss goals come faster. This isn’t magic. I’ve reduced my stress response by allowing myself grace, which promotes weight loss.

Overall, the key to my success and what I’ve found wholeheartedly to be true, is I’ve changed my habits and relationships with food. I’m 40 lb down. I’m not making sacrifices. I’m not obsessing over immediate results. I’m prioritizing my health, mental, physical and emotional. I’ve turned this into something enjoyable. The truth is, self love can be fun. Be good to yourselves. ❤️

turns out there's actual science behind this, and it's not about being fake or manipulative. it's about understanding how human connection actually works. studied everything from neuroscience research to FBI negotiation tactics, and honestly? most people are doing mirroring completely wrong.

understand the psychology behind mirroring

your brain has these things called mirror neurons that literally fire when you observe someone else's actions or emotions. it's why yawning is contagious, why you unconsciously smile back at someone. mirroring taps into this hardwired system. research from Princeton showed that when two people are genuinely connecting, their brain activity literally synchronizes. wild right?



but here's where people fuck it up. they mirror the wrong things. copying someone's exact gestures two seconds after they do them makes you look like a psychopath. think about it. if someone crosses their arms and you immediately cross yours, that's not connection, that's a hostage situation.

the key is mirroring energy and emotional tone, not movements. if someone's speaking slowly and thoughtfully, you slow down too. if they're excited and animated, you bring more energy. you're matching their frequency, not their exact wavelength.

match communication styles, not words

pay attention to how people process information. some folks are super detailed and need all the context. others want the bottom line immediately. some use tons of metaphors and stories, others stick to facts and data.

i learned this from Chris Voss's book [Never Split the Difference](https://www.blackswanltd.com/never-split-the-difference) (ex FBI hostage negotiator, insanely good read on human behavior). he talks about tactical empathy, which is basically acknowledging someone's perspective without necessarily agreeing. that's advanced level mirroring.



when someone shares something, reflect back the emotion you're hearing. not parroting their words, but naming what's beneath them. ""sounds like that situation was really frustrating"" or ""that must have felt incredible."" you're showing you actually understand them, which is what mirroring is supposed to accomplish anyway.

mirror values and priorities subtly

this is the sophisticated shit that actually builds real connection. listen for what someone cares about. not just their hobbies, but their underlying values. do they talk a lot about family? fairness? achievement? creativity? freedom?

when you identify their core values, you can reference them naturally in conversation. not by suddenly pretending you share all their interests (transparent and weird), but by showing curiosity and respect for what matters to them.

there's this concept in psychology called ""strategic self disclosure"" covered really well in the podcast ""Hidden Brain"" by Shankar Vedantam. basically, sharing something slightly vulnerable that relates to what they've shared creates reciprocal trust. you're mirroring their openness level, which is way more powerful than mirroring their coffee order.

use the 70/30 rule

here's something most people miss. effective mirroring is 70% listening, 30% reflecting back. you can't mirror someone if you're too busy performing or thinking about what you'll say next.

really listen. not the nodding while mentally rehearsing your response kind. actual active listening where you're curious about understanding their worldview. when you genuinely listen, natural mirroring happens automatically. your body language adjusts, your tone shifts, you ask better questions.

if you want a more structured way to internalize all this, there's this personalized learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from sources like the books and research mentioned here, plus expert interviews on social psychology and communication. built by a team from Columbia and Google, it generates custom audio learning plans based on specific goals like ""improve social mirroring as an introvert"" or ""build authentic charisma."" you can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. the smoky voice option makes even dense psychology content pretty addictive to listen to during commutes.

the app ""Reflectly"" also has some solid exercises on active listening and emotional awareness that helped me get better at this. it's designed for journaling but the prompts make you more conscious of communication patterns.

mirror respect and boundaries

the dark side of mirroring is it can become manipulative if you're only doing it to get something. people's bullshit detectors are surprisingly good. if you're faking interest or matching someone's style purely for personal gain, they'll sense the inauthenticity eventually.

real mirroring includes respecting when someone wants distance or doesn't want to connect. some people are more reserved. some situations don't call for deep rapport building. mirroring someone's desire for light surface level interaction is just as valid as matching depth.

practice with genuine curiosity

here's what transformed this from a technique into something natural for me. i started approaching conversations with actual curiosity instead of agenda. when you're genuinely interested in how someone sees the world, mirroring becomes effortless.

read [The Art of Gathering](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.priyaparker.com/thebook) by Priya Parker. it's technically about hosting events but it's really about creating genuine human connection. she talks about how the best gatherings happen when people drop their performance and show up authentically. same applies to individual interactions.

the goal isn't to become a social chameleon who has no personality. it's to build bridges between your authentic self and others. you're not erasing yourself, you're finding the common frequency where real connection can happen.

know when to lead instead of mirror

advanced move: sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is NOT mirror someone. if someone's spiraling in negativity or anxiety, mirroring that energy just amplifies it. instead, you can gently lead them to a different emotional space by modeling calmness or optimism.

this requires reading the room and having enough social awareness to know when matching someone's state helps versus when it hurts. generally, mirror to build initial rapport, then gradually lead toward more positive or productive energy if needed.



look, humans are complicated. we want to be understood but we also want authenticity. the sweet spot is mirroring that comes from genuine interest in connecting, not from trying to manipulate someone into liking you. when you get that right, you're not copying anyone. you're just speaking their language.",1,1770217278.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

Dressing to impress on a first date isn’t about chasing trends or looking like someone you’re not. It’s about showing that you care, that you put in effort, and that you understand the setting you’re walking into. What you wear is often the first signal you send before you even speak.

Fit matters more than almost anything else. Clothes that fit your body properly instantly make you look more confident and put together. Too baggy looks careless, too tight looks uncomfortable. When something fits well, it lets you relax and focus on the date instead of adjusting your outfit.

Keep things clean and intentional. Freshly washed clothes, wrinkle-free fabric, and clean shoes go a long way. These details might seem small, but they’re noticed, and they suggest you respect both yourself and the person you’re meeting.

Your outfit should match the vibe of the date. A casual coffee date calls for something relaxed but polished, while a dinner date might need a step up in refinement. Being slightly overdressed is usually better than looking like you didn’t try at all.

Stick to simple, classic pieces if you’re unsure. Neutral colors, well-made basics, and timeless styles tend to photograph well and age well. They also keep the focus on you rather than on loud patterns or distracting choices.

Grooming is part of dressing well. A neat haircut, trimmed facial hair, subtle fragrance, and good hygiene all contribute to the overall impression. Even the best outfit can fall flat if the grooming doesn’t match.

Overall, wear something that feels like you.",1,1770217270.0,WeSuckAtDating,0,1.0,False

No one else was hurt, it was just me and a stupid little hatchback, but the pictures looked dramatic enough that my family quietly used the word miracle. I blew just high enough over the limit that I had to do the classes and the fines and I lost my license for a while. I sat in those stupid plastic chairs listening to other people tell their stories and swore I wasnt like them. I had a bad night, I was going through stress at work, my dad was sick, whatever excuse sounded less disgusting than I just cared more about wine than common sense. My boyfriend at the time, now my fiancé, picked me up from court and said he would support me if I wanted to quit drinking completely. I said yes on the spot. I really believed it for like 3 days. We threw away the bottles in the apartment, I did the dramatic social media post about starting a new chapter, his mom hugged me and said she was proud of me. I still remember the way he looked at me on my ""one month sober"" day like I had climbed a mountain or something. The truth is I relapsed before that month even finished. I didnt even try very hard to fight it. I was walking home from the bus and my feet just went into a liquor store without my brain putting up much of a fight. I bought one of those tiny travel bottles of vodka that fits in your palm. I told myself I would drink it, hate it, get it out of my system. Instead my brain lit up like a Christmas tree. I felt that warm sliding numbness and the loud anxious part of my head finally shut up for a bit. I went back two days later for a bigger bottle.



Now I live in this bizarre double life where everyone thinks I am the Responsible Sober One and I am hiding empties like a teenager. My fiancé proudly tells people at parties that he doesnt drink much because ""we dont keep alcohol in the house anymore"" while there is literally a bottle hidden in the box with our winter scarves. I top up my drinks in the bathroom when we go out by bringing a little metal flask in my purse. I tell him I am staying late at work, then sit in the parking lot with the seat reclined sipping cheap vodka from a soda cup so I dont come home smelling like a bar. I have become an expert at brushing my teeth too hard so my gums bleed a little and it looks like the alcohol smell is just from the mouthwash. I have poured water into wine bottles my friends bring over so it looks like I had a glass and decided I was done. He cried when I got my two year chip from the support group I lied about going to regularly. I actually skipped half of the meetings and sat in a cafe nearby with a spiked coffee instead, scrolling my phone. The chip is in my wallet, rubbing against my credit cards every time I pay for more alcohol. I feel sick writing this out. I know he proposed to the sober version of me who exists in his head, this strong person who turned her life around after the accident. I am scared that if I admit what is going on he will walk away, not even because of the drinking but because of the amount of lying that comes with it now. At the same time I catch myself secretly resenting him when he pours the last beer in the house down the sink or gently comments that he is glad we dont waste money on nights out anymore. He thinks he is supporting me and I know that, but part of me is already calculating where the nearest store is and how much time I have before he gets home. I dont know if I am confessing here because I actually want to stop or because I want someone anonymous to finally see the real version of me that is hiding in my own life. All I know is that every time he kisses me and says he is proud of how far I have come, I feel like I am stealing something from him, like I am wearing a strangers medal on my chest.

Hey,

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

About me: 28, 5'6"", Mexican American but asian passing, fit, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, voice calls, watching and identifying birds, voice calls, singing, dancing, socializing (I bartend in NYC!), jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movie watching. I'll be staying in Back Bay in a hotel so I can host. I'd love to talk over a sip or a coffee/tea. Feel free to ask any questions.

1qvqlqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1qvqlqa/how_to_overcome_social_anxiety_the_psychology_no/,How to Overcome Social Anxiety: The Psychology No One Tells You (But Should),"Let's be real. Social anxiety isn't just ""being shy."" It's that voice telling you everyone's judging you when you walk into a room. It's rehearsing conversations in your head for hours, then still feeling like you bombed. It's declining invites because the mental gymnastics of ""what if I'm awkward"" feel worse than staying home.

I've spent months diving into research, books, podcasts, and expert insights to understand why this happens and how to actually fix it. Not the recycled ""just be confident"" BS. Real, science-backed strategies that work.

Here's what I learned: your brain isn't broken. Social anxiety is your nervous system doing its job a bit too enthusiastically. It evolved to keep you safe from social rejection (which, thousands of years ago, could mean death). Your amygdala can't tell the difference between a networking event and a saber-toothed tiger. But here's the good news: you can rewire this.

1. Stop trying to eliminate anxiety. Learn to act despite it.

This sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. The goal isn't to feel zero anxiety before social situations. That's like waiting to feel motivated before going to the gym. It doesn't work that way.

[Matthew Hussey](https://www.matthewspeaks.com/) talks about this in his work on confidence and social skills. He says confidence isn't a prerequisite for action, it's a byproduct. You build it by doing the thing that scares you, not by waiting until you feel ready.

The trick: exposure therapy, but make it practical. Start micro. Like genuinely micro. Say hi to a cashier. Make eye contact with someone on the street. Ask a random question at a coffee shop. Your brain needs evidence that social interaction won't kill you.

Research from Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer shows that our minds are incredibly malleable. Each small win literally rewrites the neural pathways associated with fear. You're not faking it till you make it. You're building new evidence.

1. Reframe what other people are actually thinking about you.

Plot twist: they're not. At least not as much as you think.

The spotlight effect is this cognitive bias where we massively overestimate how much others notice us. Studies show we think people notice our mistakes about twice as much as they actually do. Everyone's too busy worrying about their own stuff to obsess over that weird thing you said.

This hit me when I read [The Confidence Gap](https://www.rusharris.com/) by Russ Harris (clinical psychologist, ACT expert, has helped thousands with anxiety disorders). This book is insanely good at explaining how our thoughts aren't facts. Harris breaks down how to defuse anxious thoughts instead of fighting them. Like instead of ""I'm so awkward,"" try ""I'm having the thought that I'm awkward."" Sounds simple but it creates distance.

Another banger: [Quiet](https://www.susancain.net/quiet) by Susan Cain (spent seven years researching introversion, TED talk has 30M+ views). If you've ever felt like something's wrong with you for not being the loudest person in the room, this book will make you question everything you think you know about social success. Cain shows that introversion and social anxiety aren't the same thing, and that quiet people have massive strengths society ignores.

1. Build your social skills like you'd build muscle.

Social skills aren't genetic. They're learned. And just like the gym, consistency beats intensity.

Start conversations with zero agenda. Ask questions. Listen more than you talk. People love talking about themselves and will think you're fascinating if you just shut up and be curious.

Matthew Hussey's stuff is gold for this. His YouTube channel breaks down practical conversation techniques without making you feel like a robot. Watch his videos on ""how to talk to anyone"" and ""killing awkward silences."" He makes it super digestible.

For daily practice, I'd recommend the app Finch. It's a self-care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it has solid anxiety management tools and daily check-ins that help you track social wins. Builds the habit of acknowledging progress, which your anxious brain desperately needs.

Also check out [Dr. Aziz Gazipura's](https://www.azizgazipura.com/) podcast [Shrink for the Shy Guy](https://www.azizgazipura.com/podcast). He's a clinical psychologist who specializes in social confidence. His episodes on ""nice guy syndrome"" and people-pleasing are uncomfortably accurate. He gives actionable homework assignments you can actually use.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building social confidence and overcoming anxiety consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals.

Type in what you're working on, like managing social anxiety or building conversation skills, and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or other sessions without feeling like work.

The uncomfortable truth: You'll probably feel anxious for a while. Maybe a long while. But you can be anxious AND social. You can be nervous AND go to that party. You can feel awkward AND still connect with people.

Your anxiety isn't a life sentence. It's just your brain being overly protective. Thank it for trying to help, then do the thing anyway.",1,1770216750.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False
1qvqkvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1qvqkvq/ive_worked_in_soooo_many_different_coffee_shops/,“I’ve worked in soooo many different coffee shops!”,"this is a long rant about my coworker…

 the cafe I  work at opened in May and I’ve been working there since the beginning of June, helping my boss make recipes, learn how to use things, get the part time high schoolers trained on how to steam milk and stuff, and just making sure everything with the barista stuff is cohesive. 

  
I have a coworker that started in like November. Im in my early 20s and she’s in her 30s I think. Im the only part time barista so she started doing the front and back to get more hours and to help out more. my boss was ecstatic that she had worked so many places in town and so many coffee shops…Im pretty sure she’s only worked at 2-3 different ones and has been working at other jobs for the past 7 years or so. I have barista experience at 2 different shops before this one but apparently not as impressive as this lady… 

  
the things she does is super weird too… Ive been working there for 5 more months than her but she bosses me around… she’s nice and makes conversation with me and stuff but then she’ll be like “did you take out this trash?” or other things that I know that Im supposed to do that and have been since before she started. on Monday one of the carafes weren’t working well and I tested them out tl see what the problem might be and figured maybe it was that it wasn’t sealing properly because of something wrong with the base since the lids both worked on the other base but not this one. tested again on Tuesday and then told my boss and she said to use a different one tomorrow. the lady works Wednesdays so i told her we needed to  use a different one tomorrow and started to tell her why it’s not working and she cut me off saying she thinks it’s because we shouldn’t be soaking the lids and we can’t do that and blah blah. After she was done I  explained that Im pretty sure it’s the base because the lids both worked on the other base and she cut me off again saying that she’ll just get another one then. I told her again that yeah, our boss said to use the other one and left it. 

we added some combos to the menu the end of December and one of the combos is a new drink with stuff and we also have that drink separately from a combo. A DoorDash with that combo came in and she started to  make it. while she was making it she came up to  me and said “you know that \[name of drink\] is also just a drink, right?” I was like what? and she said “its not just a combo, you know that right?“ and I was like “yes??” Like what prompted her to ask me that? ive been working 4 days a week since the menu changed and she’s  worked 2 days a week… people order just the drink and people order the combo? Plus this was a DoorDash?? It’s not like someone asked me for it and I put The wrong one in??

One of the barista closing duties is to take out the recycling so I do that… Im proud to say that I do Everything on the closing task which is kinda silly but I’ll come in on mondays to dirty counters, unstocked item, dirty dishes that smell disgusting, and other things (like we‘re closed on Sunday’s and she won’t clean out the blender and leave the lid on on Saturdays and it’s so gross on Monday…). Every time I work with her when she’s in The back she always acts like she’s the One that needs to take the recycling out…she grabs it before I can And takes it? Or tells me “oh I can Take that!” like, I  appreciate it but you also have stuff to do that you don’t do?? 

the cafe is a Latin cafe and neither of us are Latino but she can speak some Spanish. There’s a guy that only speaks Spanish and when he first started coming in this summer he wouldn’t even look at me or try to take an order with me. after a few months he started looking at me and being friendly and smiling and I’d try to take his order but sometimes I’d mess up so I’d ask someone like my boss to double check that I  got his order right. Yesterday I asked the lady to take it because I had To make a bunch of drinks and I didnt really want to deal with getting an order wrong. I talked to her later about it telling her the story of how he went from completely ignoring me to trying to joke with me over the past 5 months and she just said “oh hes just like that. He did that to me for a few weeks.” girl! You’ve “known” him for 3 months and you speak spanish so it’s easier for you to communicate with him?! for me it felt nice to have him try to joke with me after 5 months because I  don’t speak Spanish and he doesn’t speak English… we have another coworker whos latino but he’s like 18 and lived in the US all his life but speaks Spanish. his name is a name that can be English or Spanish but he says it the English way. my boss is Latino and she says his name the English way too. the lady…whos white… was calling him the Spanish version of his name with a big accent… I was just kinda like 😀 while she talked to me about him bc idk if he would even like her calling him that. she’ll also randomly speak to my boss in Spanish and my boss will just reply to her in English which I  find funny.

  
oh! and because shes worked in soooo many coffee shops she can come up with “good” flavor combos… toffee nut syrup in chai… way to sweet and takes away the chai flavor 😭 my boss has kinda relied on me to come up with seasonal drinks and this lady kinda butts in to make her suggestions and my boss is like “oh wow! this is great!” it’s not great… in theory I think a mint matcha could be good but it kinda just tastes like toothpaste and my boss doesnt even like matcha so she’s not really the person to test it…

  
also in like September my boss asked me to design print out menus and I  spent hours making them look beautiful and sent them to her. months later we didn’t have them yet but I didnt ask. when this lady got hired my boss asked her to make new menus for our tvs and I  was kinda upset bc like… I can do that? last week I found paper menus and they weren’t mine… they were made by the lady and they were ugly….

1qvqirm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1qvqirm/college_student_feeling_like_a_failure/,College student feeling like a failure,"Hi all, for obvious reasons im writing this from a throwaway account. I was thinking of coming on here for advice for years and I didn’t have the courage until  now. I’m not even sure if this is the correct sub for this. This is a quite lengthy life situation so please tag along and let me know what I should do. I have it tagged as career advice but it’s more of school/ life advice I guess. 

For some context Im currently a 24 year old girl, feeling beyond lost in life and feeling like time is passing and im a failure who’s behind. SO behind that I can’t even take control of my life to continue as much as I want to. Im gonna break it up in parts so it’s not a big wordy paragraph in hopes of it being clear and not confusing.

Im a first generation college student, my family and I moved to the states when I was around 10. I had to learn the language and take all the responbility of paper work/documents/etc for my parents. Throughout high school they were beyond strict with me, I was never allowed to see friends, go out, or have fun. As the question of college was coming closer, I had no guidance from them. To be honest with everyone, I had no idea what college even was supposed to be like until end of junior year. I knew I had to apply, I had alright grades but I had no idea what I wanted to do in the future, where I wanted to go to college or anything. There was a college trip my high school took which my parents didn’t let me go to. To this day I look back at that and feel like I put the entire blame on them for how my college years turned out bc I was so sheltered and didn’t know what I was going into. I decided to move 7 hours away in my state to a community college where I would then transfer to a top university in my state. My parents supported my decision paid for my housing and the rest was covered by aid. A big reason why I chose to move away, as you can guess was to get away from my parents and have freedom. Unfortunately me having all this freedom after practically living at home jail didn’t mix well. I became so thrilled with my free will I started going out almost everyday, taking plans with people no matter the school work I had and eventually that all reflected in my grades. I spent 2 years majoring in a major I secretly hated, but I knew nothing about myself or what I wanted to do. After I decided to change my major to something within the communications world because that felt more me. I will get into more of that in the next paragraph. I did about 2 years at the CC after failing almost all of my classes I realized the rural city I was living in was not for me and I wanted to move back home. I had ZERO sense of what I should have been doing, I wish I had the guidance of someone telling me to do XYZ and I think I have a lot of anger within myself for not doing better. I decided to move back and continue online. I have SO much regret for moving so far away, wasting my parents money on rent and realistically getting nowhere. However, if I never moved away my relationship with my parents would’ve been AWFUL. The only bright side of moving away was that my parents gave me more freedom, more respect, and I truly saw our relationship flourish and become what I always wish it was. For the last few years I can’t help but to think what would’ve happened if I just didn’t move away and went to a good 4 year near me that I was accepted to, but I guess everything happens for a reason and my choices have got me where I am.

I’ve always wondered why I didn’t have the same drive for school that I did for work. I had been working since I was 15, doing small jobs like babysitting and helping kids with homework. Then when I was 17 I started working retail. I was in the retail space for about 6 years. Even when I was in college I was also working part time. I was and still am a major go getter and hustler. When I moved back home from college I was attempting to do online classes as well work. However I felt so depressed from the fact that I had wasted 2 years majoring In something I did not want to do that I took a gap year which turned into probably 2. After I moved home I was DETERMINED to find what I wanted to major in and work for something I was passionate about. I cold emailed over 100 pr/marketing agencies to get a remote internship to see if that’s what I wanted to do. I landed my first remote pr internship, it was unpaid but I was still working at my retail store so I was managing just fine. I always preferred work to school and I never understood how and why someone who was such a go getter couldn’t find it within to finish or continue school. After I wrapped up my internship I got an in person one at an amazing luxury boutique agency. I was working 30+ hours throughout 4 days and the other 3 days I was interning. I did this for about 6 months. I had no off days and I was pushing myself to make connections within the industry. After my second internship wrapped up I tried to get back into school and take one online class while I juggled everything else. I had opportunities I could never even imagine. I was flown out to a major city for major events to do production/pr for them, and this time it was paying. When I got back I landed my best internship with a global agency that I could have never imagined I even got. The only reason I got this was because I actually met the hiring director at my retail job and she gave me the contacts and set up the interviews for me. At this point I felt like even my retail job was great for reason, I was in the industry I loved and I was making connections that were helping me for my career. I started my internship again where I was basically working 7 days a week with no off days. This last internship truly set it in stone for me that the one thing to make me a qualified candidate I needed a degree. at my last day of the internship I had a exit coffee chat where the head of the office told me that she had not seen someone my age ( 23 at the time) have such a packed and impressive resume. For the PR/marketing field I knew she was right because I had people from high 4 year universities reaching out to me for advice. She told me once I graduate I have nothing to worry about and will be hired immediately for the position I apply for. About 2 weeks ago I actually  freelanced with the same agency, and they asked when I was graduating since a position had opened up. My heart felt so heavy knowing if I had taken all the right steps I could have had my dream job.

Me not being able to get back in school has affected me in ways I can’t even tell all of you. It’s like I know the right thing I have to do but I can’t get myself to do it. I was on academic probation for failing my classes, even after I got off I felt like I couldn’t get myself to go into the portal and register myself for the classes. Even now I can’t get myself to transfer to a different community college to see if I can get this traumatizing feeling of doom off my chest. I feel so stupid so behind that I was supposed to be graduated and im still “in school”. I graduated high school in 2021 so I’ve basically spent 5 years wasting my life. I know that’s not true and I have accomplished a lot but I havant accomplished the one main thing I was supposed to. It breaks my heart knowing that people who I didn’t think were capable graduated college and I didn’t. I know Im capable bc I’ve been able to do everything else I’ve done but I just can’t do this. I feel like I’ve been doing everything backwards, I’ve done the internships, I’ve done the networking, I’ve done the work, I have the savings, I have traveled the world. But I still can’t do what I know will make my parents proud. The worst part of this situation is that no one knows. I mean NO ONE, you guys are the first ppl to know this. Ive been lying to my friends, my parents, my family, my boyfriend. This situation has given me so much anxiety over the years that I’ve refused to hang out with friends because I dont want them asking me about school about my plans, when my family asks I have to keep lying and its one of the worst secrets I’ve had to keep. I constantly feel heavy, im constantly anxious, when I go to bed all I can think of is how much of a failure I am and how much time I wasted. I have heart palpitations when I think of my future and honestly I’ve wondered if it’s even worthy of living because of how behind I am. Ive never talked to anyone about this, I’ve just attempted to tru to keep going myself but I feel like I need second opinions. Its been beyond difficult watching my friends and those around me graduating college, moving onto doing masters and im still in community college.

I can’t help to think if I didn’t move away, if I finished school on time, by this time now I would’ve secured my dream job, I could’ve completed the next step in potentially being engaged. But even if I start now, I won’t finish school until im 28 which is pathetic of me. Im sorry for the long text, but I do hope you guys read it and give me some good advice on what I should do.

1qvqh44,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qvqh44/how_to_read_the_room_before_speaking_the/,How to Read the Room Before Speaking: The Science-Based Social Skill That'll Save Your Ass,"Look, I spent years putting my foot in my mouth at parties, meetings, family dinners. I'd crack jokes that landed like wet cement. Share opinions nobody asked for. Walk into conversations and somehow make everything awkward. 



The worst part? I genuinely had NO idea what I was doing wrong.



Then I started studying social dynamics obsessively. Read books on body language, binged communication podcasts, dove into psychology research. Turns out ""reading the room"" isn't some mystical talent you're born with. It's a learnable skill that most people just never get taught.



Here's what I've figured out from years of research and trial/error:



Stop talking first, start observing



Most of us walk into spaces already planning what we'll say. Wrong move. Spend the first few minutes in any setting just watching and listening. Notice the energy level. Is conversation flowing easily or is there tension? Are people leaning in or backing away? Is it loud and chaotic or quiet and focused?



Match that energy. If the room's buzzing with excitement, your monotone analysis of tax policy will bomb. If everyone's having a serious discussion about layoffs, your standup routine won't hit.



Watch the faces, not just the words



People lie with their mouths constantly. Their faces tell the truth. When someone's talking, scan the listeners. Are they nodding along? Glazed over? Exchanging glances? Checking phones?



Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this extensively in her work on body language. She's a behavioral investigator who's analyzed thousands of hours of human interaction. Her book ""Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People"" breaks down facial microexpressions and what they actually mean. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social interaction. She explains how most people completely misread basic social cues because we're taught to listen to words instead of watching behavior.



The tension between someone's words and their face is where the real information lives. ""Yeah that's fine"" plus tight lips and avoiding eye contact means it's definitely not fine.



Learn the conversation patterns



Every group has a rhythm. Some take turns speaking. Others talk over each other constantly. Some pause for thoughtful responses. Others fire back immediately.



Jump in wrong and you'll either interrupt someone mid-thought or wait so long the topic's moved on. Watch for three conversation cycles before contributing. You'll start picking up the timing naturally.



Notice the power dynamics



Who's driving the conversation? Whose comments get the most reaction? Who gets interrupted versus who people wait for? When that person speaks, does everyone shift their body toward them?



This matters because dropping a controversial take when the ""room leader"" just said the opposite is social suicide. You can disagree, but you better make it tactful and pick your moment.



Robert Greene's ""The Laws of Human Nature"" dives deep into social hierarchies and power dynamics. He's studied historical figures and modern leaders to understand how influence actually works. The section on reading people's true intentions is disturbingly accurate. Fair warning though, this book might make you slightly paranoid about everyone's hidden agendas, but honestly? That's useful information.



Check your audience knowledge level



Nothing kills a room faster than explaining basic concepts to experts or using jargon with beginners. Before launching into your point, do a quick mental check. What does this group likely already know? What assumptions can I make?



If you're unsure, test the waters with a quick qualifier. ""I don't know how familiar everyone is with this, but..."" gives people permission to stop you if needed.



Read the relationship web



Who knows who? Who's friends, who's rivals, who's sleeping together, who just broke up? These invisible connections determine how your words land.



Complimenting Sarah's idea when half the room knows she screwed over Mike last week will make you look clueless. Making a joke about someone's expense when they're genuinely struggling financially is brutal, even if you didn't know.



If you want to go deeper into social dynamics without reading another 300-page book, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) might be worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert insights into personalized audio content. 



You can type in something like ""I'm an introvert who struggles to read social cues in group settings"" and it'll build you a structured learning plan pulling from resources on communication psychology, body language research, and social intelligence. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context when you want to really understand something. Useful for commutes or gym time when you can't sit down with a book.



This is everything



There's moments when the room is open to new topics and moments when it's not. If three people are deep in debate, that's not your window. If there's a natural lull and people are looking around, that's your shot.



Same with tone shifts. If everyone just finished laughing, don't immediately pivot to heavy topics. If something serious just got discussed, don't crack wise unless you really read the situation correctly.



Trust your gut but verify with data



Your instincts about room energy are usually right. That ""something feels off"" sensation? Listen to it. But also collect actual evidence. Are you seeing closed off body language? Hearing short responses? Getting less eye contact?



Sometimes anxiety makes us think we're bombing when we're fine. Sometimes confidence makes us miss that we're annoying everyone. Cross reference your gut feeling with observable behavior.



The recovery matters more than the mistake



You will misread rooms. Everyone does. The key is catching it fast and adjusting. If you crack a joke and get silence instead of laughs, don't double down or get defensive. Quick acknowledgment and topic shift. ""Okay tough crowd, anyway..."" works better than explaining why your joke was funny actually.



Chris Voss's ""Never Split the Difference"" has incredible sections on this. He's a former FBI hostage negotiator who breaks down tactical empathy and reading hidden signals. The techniques he used to negotiate with terrorists work surprisingly well at dinner parties. His stuff on mirroring and labeling emotions to build rapport is genuinely game changing for difficult conversations.



Practice in low stakes environments



You don't learn this at board meetings. Start at coffee shops, casual hangouts, family dinners. Make it a game. Predict how people will react before you speak. See if you were right. Adjust your approach based on what you notice.



The more reps you get, the faster this becomes automatic. Eventually you won't consciously think ""I should read the room first,"" you'll just naturally scan and calibrate before opening your mouth.



The truth is our biology wasn't built for modern social complexity. We evolved for small tribes where everyone knew each other intimately. Now we're navigating massive social networks, professional hierarchies, online dynamics, cultural differences. Our hardware is outdated for the software we're running.



But our brains are adaptable. With deliberate practice, you can develop social awareness that feels almost superhuman compared to where you started. It just takes paying attention to what's actually happening instead of what you wish was happening.

Context: Hi, i just want to share this.

May friend ako, we’ve only been close for about 7 months, met through our internship circle. After a while, narealize ko na gusto ko siya. Subtle lang, coffee or dinner, just the two of us, and lagi naman siyang go. After a month, nag confess ako, sabi niya friends lang talaga and di na kami nag usap after.

After 5 days ata, may program event kami sa school, so sila nag bar, while ako nasa bahay with friends umiinom din, medyo tipsy na rin, i messaged her and asked her kung may chance pa kahit konti. Sabi niya no commitment lang kaya niya. Then ininvite ko siya sa dinner para pag usapan. Sabi niya that time hindi siya sure, sabi ko naman antayin ko sagot niya. Tapos after some time sinabi niya YES and she will take the chance daw. After that ligawan moments lang.

Then her extension duty started. Things changed, less conversation, less effort from her, I had to initiate everything. She’d reply late, pero active sa TikTok. May time pa sinamahan ko siya maglakad pauwi, after that walang thank you or if nakauwi na ba ako.

My sweet babe was seeming to be pretty reactive when I would have dairy of any kind. So I took the step to cut allllll of it out, including soy just to be safe. As it’s pretty clear it must be CMPA (go to the ped in a week to discuss). 

But we went for a family dinner at a mexi restaurant and I ordered the simplest, most plain thing I could find (a burrito bowl- corn, beans, chicken, rice) and told them I can’t have dairy. I also had ONE marg, but pumped before I drank it and fed baby with that milk and then didn’t feed him again until 2-3 hours later 

now the 3ish days following that dinner, baby has had a VERY sensitive tummy. It hasn’t been constant, but at least once a day, sometimes 2  

He will feed fine, but sometimes act like he’s straining/stretching legs out and then poop (very watery and orange-ish) or spit up an ungodly amount (everything he just ate). & we do burp him lol!  

Now I did have an overactive letdown with my last, and I think I still have that problem. I’ve been trying to hookup to the pump first to catch the letdown and then feed him after but sometimes it still comes out fast and a lot… I’m not even sure this could be the problem?? 

Idk I’m just super stressed out because I am VERY careful of what I eat. The only other two options I have to cut out are eggs and coffee and I’m losing my mind. I’ll do it but I’m not excited lol 

I will take any advice and suggestions as this is all so new to me, seeing as my first would only  slightly react when I had milk or cream cheese.

I did a bit of searching before posting and found out that a burnt plastic connector is not uncommon. I just wanted to get some advice for my case. Hope I'm not double posting or asking questions already answered.

So for the past \~2 weeks, I started noticing a burn smell when turning on my machine. I never leave it on for more than 15 minutes.   
I have a LED tank light kit plugged in (from Shades of Coffee), but the light it self was not plugged in for a couple of weeks, just the transformer (because I want waiting for a replacement). Could just having the transformer plugged in without the light could've caused this? I would think not since no power/electricty is being consumed, but you never know.

For the metal connector itself, can I just wrap it with electric tape or should I find another plastic connector?

We need to talk about [Spectron](https://www.tombihn.com/search?q=spectron).

I bought my first Tom Bihn bag back in 2016 and I’ve been a loyalist ever since. In that time, I’ve spiraled into the usual madness: I’ve owned the tanks in Ballistic Nylon, I snagged one of the limited run X-Pac Synik 30s (don’t @ me), and I’ve hoarded Halcyon like it was currency in a post-apocalyptic dystopia.

But recently, I’ve been living that Spectron life, and frankly, I’m ruined for other materials. If you’re sitting there clutching your 1050d Ballistic bag thinking, “I don’t need another one,” I am here to be the devil on your shoulder. Here is why you are wrong.

# 1. What actually is it? (The Nerd Stuff)

For those who don't stalk the fabric supply chain blogs: 420d Spectron is Tom Bihn’s custom successor to the legendary 400d Halcyon (RIP to the 400, long live the 200).

It’s a 420-denier high-tenacity nylon base, reinforced with a 400-denier Spectra® grid. Spectra is that Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) stuff—basically the superhero of fibers. It’s light, it floats, and it’s stronger than steel by weight.

**Translation:** It’s a ripstop fabric that went to the gym.

# 2. Why it’s unique

Most ""tech"" fabrics today feel like you're carrying a plastic tarp. Spectron feels like... fabric.

* **The ""Liquid"" Factor:** Unlike Ballistic (which stands up on its own like a well-trained soldier) or X-Pac (which stands up because it’s stiff as a board), Spectron is *supple*. It drapes. It molds to your back. If the bag isn't full, it compresses down to nothing.
* **The Stealth Grid:** It’s black-on-black (usually). In the shade, it looks like a sleek matte nylon. Hit it with sunlight, and that UHMWPE grid pops with a subtle, techy sheen. It looks expensive without screaming ""I AM A TACTICAL OPERATOR.""
* **The Silence:** It doesn't crinkle. You can open your bag in a quiet library without sounding like you're unwrapping a bag of Doritos.

# 3. The ""Double Dip"" Argument

*“But I already own a Synik in Ballistic! Why would I buy the EXACT SAME BAG in Spectron?”*

Because function follows fabric.

* **The Ballistic Version:** Is a tank. It’s structured. It protects the contents from the world. It’s for when you’re commuting on the subway or checking a bag.
* **The Spectron Version:** Is a ghost. It weighs less. It hugs your body. Crucially, it squishes. If you've ever tried to jam a fully loaded Ballistic Synik into a Spirit Airlines sizer or under a tight aisle seat, you know it fights back. Spectron complies.

Owning both **is not redundancy; it’s** ***strategic versatility***. (Use this line on your spouse/partner; it works 60% of the time, every time).

# 4. Why it is NOT X-Pac or EPX

I see people comparing Spectron to X-Pac (VX21/VX42) or EPX400 constantly. Let's pause on that.

I say this as someone who owns a closet full of this stuff. I have a bunch of custom Greenroom136 builds in EPX400. I have the Able Carry Max 32L in X-Pac. I even own the limited edition Synik 30 in X-Pac. I love those bags, but let’s be real about the difference:

X-Pac and EPX are laminates. They are layers of fabric glued/bonded together to be waterproof and stiff. That creates a ""box"" feel—the bag keeps its shape whether it's empty or full.

Spectron is a weave. There is no lamination glue. It relies on the tightness of the weave and the coating for water resistance. While my Able Carry and Greenroom136 bags feel like *luggage* strapped to my back, Spectron feels like *clothing*. It moves with you.

# 5. Long-Term Survivability

If you keep a bag for 10+ years (which we all do), the failure points matter.

* **Old School Ballistic/Cordura:** If you’ve owned an old-school bag for 15+ years, you might know the ""flaking"" nightmare. The internal urethane coating can eventually break down (hydrolysis) and smell like vomit. It happens to the best of them.
* **X-Pac / EPX:** These are amazing, but they have a specific vulnerability: **Delamination**. Because they are layers bonded together, heavy folding or creasing (like stuffing a bag into a locker daily) *can* eventually cause the layers to separate or ""bubble"" over years of abuse.
* **Spectron:** This is why I think it’s the endgame. Because the strength comes from the weave (that UHMWPE grid), not a laminate bond, it cannot delaminate. Even if the internal coating eventually wears thin in 20 years, the bag’s structural integrity is locked into the grid. It won't bubble. It won't peel. It just survives.

# 6. How the other guys compare

* **AER / Alpaka:** These guys love the ""Stiff Box"" aesthetic, whether it's using X-Pac, Ultra, or their own proprietary stiff laminates (like Axogrid). If you like a bag that stands up on its own and looks like a monolith, they are great. But if you want a bag that actually compresses when empty and doesn't feel like a turtle shell, Spectron wins.
* **Bellroy:** They use ""Baida Nylon"" or recycled polys. They feel nice and look heritage, but they lack that technical ""grid"" strength. Spectron looks future-heritage.
* **Greenroom136:** As I mentioned, I love my custom EPX gear from them. But EPX is still a laminate. Their Cordura is bombproof but heavy. Spectron sits in that Goldilocks zone of ""lighter than Cordura, tougher than standard Nylon, softer than X-Pac.""

# 7. My One Big Complaint

If Spectron is so good, why is it so hard to buy? My biggest gripe is that TB treats Spectron like a rare Pokémon. Bags come in stock and vanish instantly.

Also, the colors. We have **Black** and now (finally) **Bordeaux**. That’s it. Why? Because dyeing UHMWPE (the Spectra grid) is a chemical nightmare. The fiber is chemically inert(aka it hates dye). That’s why the grid is usually black or white. To get other colors, they have to custom weave massive amounts of fabric, which means huge Minimum Order Quantities (and TB is still a small volume player).

So, if you see a Spectron bag you want in stock? Buy it. Because the ""Notify Me"" list is where dreams go to die.",17,1770216031.0,tombihn,29,0.7,False

1qvq9ms,https://i.redd.it/gs0zxrwwohhg1.jpeg,Chocolates I bought in Switzerland 🇨🇭 and Chamonix 🇫🇷,"Hello everyone,

Here are the chocolate bars I bought during a short trip to Switzerland 🇨🇭 and Chamonix 🇫🇷 .

The four bars at the bottom are from Shouka, a bean-to-bar chocolate maker and also a high-altitude coffee roaster.

They have won several awards in France for some of their bars.

All the other bars come from the Swiss supermarket Migros.

I really noticed a clear difference between the supermarket chocolates and the more high-end / artisan ones especially in terms of flavour complexity and sugar level.

The supermarket bars feel much sweeter, while the bean-to-bar chocolates taste more balanced and expressive of the cacao itself.

I’d be curious to know if you’ve had a similar experience when comparing supermarket chocolate with artisan or bean-to-bar bars. 🍫",24,1770215964.0,chocolate,3,0.97,False

I was trying to fix my coffee (iced, definitely wasn't doing this with hot coffee lol) while baby's bottle was warming up. As things happen when working one handed, the timer went off and LO was crying in the middle of the process. So I improvised - baby in one arm, fixing coffee with the other hand, balancing his bottle with my chin. 

It wasn't a perfect scenario - i still spilled coffee and had to clean it up - but dang it i was starving and tired, and just wanted my first meal while my little hobbit got his second breakfast.
