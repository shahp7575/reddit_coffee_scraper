1iwj75v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwj75v,Need help with living room configuration,"I used .5x on my phone so the room looks bigger than it actually is!

Im in the middle of spring cleaning and reorganizing the closet storage, please excuse the general mess and metal shelving!

I‚Äôm really struggling with my living room setup. I‚Äôve lived at this apartment for a while but have been depressed, so I just threw everything up against the wall and didn‚Äôt put up any decorations. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to best arrange my living room furniture. I just have the two chairs, not looking to buy a couch anytime soon. The TV has to stay on its current wall. Other furniture are the two cat trees, the bookshelf, coffee table, end table, and a wooden secretary. I feel like ideally I would have a more balanced setup with the two chairs not backed against the wall, more angled towards each other, with the end table between them? And I suppose keep the secretary where it is or move it into a different room and replace with the bookshelf? Idk every configuration idea feels equally ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in my head. 

I could try and move everything around in different configurations, but I have a disability and can injure myself easily so I‚Äôm trying to avoid moving furniture unless absolutely necessary.

1iwj4da,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iwj4da/references_what_to_do_when_previous/,References? What to do when previous supervisors/higher ups are MIA,"I left my last work place after almost 8 years with increasing responsibility and title changes. While I had a lot of opportunity at my workplace, I ended up becoming a sort of jack of all trades which led to serious burnout and then I plateaued on available opportunities to move up (there just weren‚Äôt any, roles were full). I was saved from a large reduction in force/restructure in my department due to ‚Äúorganizational and content knowledge‚Äù and a role was created for me. However I still ended up helping to onboard and guide people moving into similar versions of two of my old roles for about a year and a half before I had a last straw moment and politely tendered my resignation via email. I offered 2 weeks, they asked if I could wrap it up in a week and I left with 144 hours of PTO. If that explains kind of how things had been going. 

Anyway. Left, took a breather for a while and moved into a role that set me back on my hopeful career trajectory. Unfortunately, due to some financial stability (and current government admin) concerns, I have concerns about my longevity here for more than a year or two (just hit month 8). 

I‚Äôm planning to and would like to stay but have had a few ‚Äúcan‚Äôt miss‚Äù opportunities to interview and will likely be keeping an eye out to leave depending on what happens with government funding as it greatly impacts my field. 

My main concerns are my 8 month gap between jobs and short time here (both smaller?) and the fact that it may be very difficult to get references from my two former supervisors or department head. All three left the org either two years before I did or within 6 months of me leaving. Two promised references when I left including the department head, who was the person who directly saved my job when my team was eliminated, and someone who was my supervisor for about two years when I first started.

Of the three, one moved to Florida and I have not been able to stay in touch with her, one just left for what I‚Äôm gathering were personal reasons (she didn‚Äôt move to another org, she was a VP and my department head), and the third scheduled coffee with me, had to reschedule, then followed up close to the day of and effectively never rescheduled with me. I‚Äôm aware she had a family loss, but even now a couple months later she never responded.

How bad is this? I feel like a lot of people are leaving and I‚Äôve tried to maintain relationships, but right now the best I could do for interviews are my old direct report, someone who dotted line managed me, someone I dotted line managed on some projects, a former client I am still friends with, and MAYBE a director and manager from another department who were both let go in the restructure. All of these people are now 1-3 years removed from being at my last job. I‚Äôm starting a volunteer job next week as well, but this is really my network for references right now.

Is this common? I‚Äôve noticed some workplaces asking for people who have managed you so I squeaked by at my current job with my former client and dotted line manager. ",1,1740341119.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

I am posting this after hearing so many ""Social media success stories"", I thought I'd share my bit and try my luck to see if my personal situation and needs align with someone else out there, preferably close to Oakville ON? 

About me- I'm a 30yo working adult female, currently in Hamilton ON. I have a Full time job in Oakville and a part time job. My backgound is East Asian. I am a respectful, hygienic, calm, mind-own-business person. 

I am a bad driver and also don't love it, covering the Hamilton-Oakville distance everyday is like a speeding race game for me where I am 'very' scared the whole time and it is taking 2.5 hours minimum each day for me (rush hours). 
Moving from Hamilton to Oakville has been super hard due to increased rental prices. In Hamilton, I am currently renting a room for $550/month all inclusive (I got lucky I guess). I am looking to move to Oakville, Mississauga or Burlington to hopefully a place where the they need a ""Neighbor"" and not just a ""tenant"" as what I can offer financially may not be enough as per market rate. 

I am hygienic, professional and punctual person who loves to mind her own business. I am learning to appreciate the small things in life as I have missed them all along I feel. I am looking for positive good company and I offer my support in time of need just like good neighbors do, respectful tenant landlord relationshop with occasional food sharing or optional gardening (something I want to learn but I am bad at). I would be very happy to meet for a shot coffee (my treat) and discuss if this is something that could work for us.

It‚Äôs funny, you spend all day with these thoughts shifting through your brain, but then the moment you set down to put them on paper, everything leaves you. Ok, I guess to keep it simple, I‚Äôll start at the beginning. Or at least, what I think is the beginning.¬†

I‚Äôll start with the first thing I can remember. It was the water‚Ä¶but also, it was the feeling surrounding it. It‚Äôs how all memories become, the dimensions of reality collapsing into bas-relief, a snapshot in time. As I sit here trying to think back as far as I can remember, I‚Äôm realizing that the totality of my life now belongs to me as a string of images and impressions pinned to a single fragile string stretching backwards into infinity, anchored perhaps in the heart of a star.¬†

The oldest picture that I can reach is the moment of my death. My legs are stretched out in front of me, and I‚Äôm wearing my favorite jeans, the ones with the hole pre-cut into the right knee in a gaudy attempt to look worn. The steering wheel is in front of me too, but my hands are floating several inches above it. Everything, I realize, is floating. I am suspended in the crystalline lattice of this moment like a chunk of meat in a jello mold. I am trapped in that weightless ticklish belly feeling of free-falling, and I will never get relief. I am forced to look in horror at the water rushing up to meet the windshield. And everything else, the smell of the hot coffee spilling across the passenger seat, the sound of rushing air mixed with a pathetic whining ripping itself from my throat, is congealing into a single impression in my mind.¬†

The next thing is fuzzier, less distinct. It‚Äôs funny, but the older you get, the more life you live, the more it seems like your brain stops pausing to take those snapshots. Everything from early times used to come at me fast, a staccato rhythm of memories as frantic as a paparazzi‚Äôs trigger finger. But now, everything is different. It feels like each new memory is a sacrifice. I once had a coworker (I least‚Ä¶I think he was a coworker? He might have been my Uncle, or..?) tell me that his mind was like so many penguins squeezing onto an iceberg; every time a new penguin jumped up, it pushed another one off. That is what life is like for me now, an endless exchange of penguins while I desperately clutch to the few things that once held meaning. But I‚Äôm getting distracted again.

The next thing. That was waking up in a hospital bed. I can remember the feel of the too-stiff industrial cotton under my fingertips, and the pounding in my head. The room was bright in that sanitized way that makes your breath catch. There was a man looming over me. He had crisp, clean professional clothing and a white jacket. He wore a kind smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes.¬†

‚ÄúMrs. XXX? Emily?‚Äù he was asking. My head swam, I struggled to focus on his voice. The world was slipping from me like sand through my limp fingers.

‚ÄúDo you know where you are right now?‚Äù he pushed.

I shook my head softly, tried to mouth the word ‚Äúno‚Äù but no voice came.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ok. You‚Äôre in the hospital, Ruthford General‚Äù he offered. For a long moment he paused, seemingly searching my face for something‚Ä¶a sign of recognition? When he didn‚Äôt find what he was looking for, he continued.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Tuesday today. You‚Äôve been asleep since you were brought in last Friday. You were in an accident, nearly drowned. Luckily someone spotted your vehicle and was able to get you here. You‚Äôre lucky to be alive.‚Äù

I shook my head numbly. His words were all there but I struggled to make meaning from them. All the components made sense: hospital, car, drowning; but I couldn‚Äôt piece them together, to lay them on the larger backdrop of my life. I realized with a start that I couldn‚Äôt remember who I was.

Evidently seeing the terror in my eyes, the young Doctor reached out to grab my hand where it lay numbly at my side.

‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm sorry, I know that‚Äôs a lot to take in. For now, just know that you‚Äôre safe. You‚Äôve got a long road ahead, but you‚Äôll have support every step of the way.‚Äù¬†

I swallowed heavily and nodded, tears prickling at the corner of my vision. And that‚Äôs it, the little stage-play in my mind fades to black with the stabbing globus sensation rising high in my throat.

The next pieces are‚Ä¶better? Little photos of me, surrounded by friends and family. There are yellow carnations on the table beside my hospital bed. Someone said they were my favorite‚Ä¶from before? I think that makes sense, perhaps still does, I don‚Äôt know. Something yellow at least, chrysanthemums, because I liked the name?

It doesn‚Äôt matter. In the pictures I‚Äôm smiling, because I‚Äôve gotten my memories back. At least, I *think* that‚Äôs what's happened. I can‚Äôt recall the memories themselves, I just know I had the *feeling* of remembering in those pictures. I remember the sensation of slipping back into my skin like falling into a warm bath, a balm for the previous soul-deep ache. But now I‚Äôm looking at the pictures again and I can see the outlines of the figures around me but the faces are blurred and‚Ä¶oh god, I can‚Äôt remember their faces, my own parent‚Äôs faces, oh my god‚Ä¶

No. This is why I‚Äôm doing this. I‚Äôm keeping a record here, something immutable, something to anchor myself to in this storm. Here, in this place, in this time, the internet is forever, right?

I‚Äôve heard it said that one technique people will use when attempting to lucid dream is to write something on their hand. Throughout the day you must tell yourself to look at the word, read it and assure yourself that you‚Äôre still awake. In your dream, this should subconsciously prompt you to look at your hand, except you won‚Äôt be able to read it; this *supposedly* will make you aware of the dream and thus able to control it.

The trouble is, I *can* read in my dreams. It‚Äôs just that the words keep changing when I glance away from the page. So maybe, if I can list things as I know them to be true here, then if anything shifts, I can catch it and know? Or maybe control it, stop *it* from happening again. The next time something shifts, something is *wrong*, I‚Äôll catch it faster and move on‚Ä¶.or‚Ä¶at least know. But I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself again.¬†

So‚Ä¶the first time *it* happened was in that hospital too. I was laying in bed. I don‚Äôt know what time it was, but I can assume that it was late at night, because the normal raucous bustle of the hospital day had settled into the calm din of hospital night. The television hung in the corner was on, playing some infomercial for a set of spoons with huge holes in the center. The sound was muted, but for a moment I sat and watched as the announcer on TV made a big show of dipping them into soup, only for most of it to pour through the middle before he could bring it to his lips. Unperturbed, he continued trying again and again and again. Somewhere in the distance a man coughed, and a machine beeped, but to my tired brain it sounded more melodious than monotonous; if I focused, I thought I could pick out the tune of an icecream truck composed entirely from high-pitched IV alarm chir-chirrups. My hospital room had a window taking up most of the wall to my right. I tried to peer beyond it, but everything was black. No moon hung to catch the welded corners of skyscrapers, no headlights of cars reached their greedy fingers through the gloom, not so much as a phantom reflection from inside the hospital room itself. Just pure, inky black.

‚ÄúI have to get out of here‚Äù I thought, and the terror was fast and ice-cold and unforgiving.

The first touch of my bare feet on the floor was torture. Weeks in a hospital bed with little sleep and even less food had left me weak. I remember the way the hospital gown clung to my pitiful frame as I stood, legs quaking beneath me, holding on to an IV pole for dear life. The burning in my legs was enough to almost make me give up, crawl back into bed and pretend this was just another bad dream. But it wasn‚Äôt. I knew that in the way that everyone just *knows*, right? Of course you know. And that window with its wrongness, and the way this room was just a bit too tall, the walls just a bit too white, light someone had constructed it based on how someone else described the idea of a room.

I forced myself forward, one foot and then another, all the while inching that IV pole forward on two wheels, terrified that it might slip out from under me at any moment. By the time I reached the door I was already exhausted, pale and sticky; the feel of my sweat sliding down my bare back made me shiver. But that was nothing compared to what lay just beyond that door.

It wasn‚Äôt just the room. This place, this entire hospital was wrong. Beyond my room‚Äôs door a single hallway stretched off into the distance. The walls canted at odd angles, coming together in seemingly impossible patterns, stretching here and thinning there as if reflected in a funhouse mirror. No lights were on, save for the single green ‚ÄúEXIT‚Äù sign that hung above the solitary door at the end of the hallway, its phosphorescent glow casting everything in sickly sharpness. With a grunt of effort I forced my protesting body forward. There were no other hospital rooms, but etched along the walls here and there I could make out the faint outline of a door frame. More than once I passed a picture frame hanging on the wall, but instead of some generic hospital art of a flower or a rainbow, the frames were empty. By the time I reached the end of the hall and stood in front of that door, my body was shaking so hard I worried that I might rattle my joints loose.¬†

The feeling of the cool metal bar of the exit under my fingers when I reached out to touch it felt like deliverance. And beyond the door? I could faintly hear what sounded like the happy chatter of voices, mixed with‚Ä¶.industrial sounds? No, more like‚Ä¶a blender? I pressed the bar down, and as the door cracked open, the smell that rushed to greet me was a warm one, coffee and fresh bread. I fell more than pushed into it.

And all at once I was on the other side. And my bones didn‚Äôt ache, and my feet weren‚Äôt cramping in the cold. I was standing at my full height, and, I realized all at once, wearing my favorite blue jeans, the ones with the hole in the left knee. Above that, a warm auburn sweater, though I could only see pieces of it from behind the black apron slung around my neck. When I looked up, it was to the scene of a coffee shop. The room was warm, but something in the quality of the light beyond the windows revealed it to be a crisp fall day. The place was packed with customers, sitting at tables, pushed into little nooks around the edges, leaning against the counters with their drinks and purses and phones.¬†

‚ÄúDid you find it?‚Äù came a voice to my right. It took me several long minutes to realize it was talking to me, something which evidently annoyed it.

‚ÄúHey, dude, wake up‚Äù it pressed. I turned to see a flustered brunette in a white tank top and jean shorts that were somehow both Mom-ish and far too taut.

‚ÄúDid you find it?‚Äù she repeated, punctuating each word with a frantic glance behind her towards the, I presume, waiting customer.

‚ÄúF-Find what?‚Äù I asked. My voice sounded foreign to my ears.¬†

‚ÄúEmily, dear lord, what were you even doing back there?‚Äù she asked, heat rising in her eyes as the woman behind her sighed dramatically.

‚ÄúBack there?‚Äù I ask.¬†

When I turned around I found a metal door with a small window set into it. Beyond the window, a completely ordinary storage room with rows of boxes pushed haphazardly onto its shelves. Completely, totally normal. An ordinary storeroom in an ordinary coffee shop on a complete ordinary fall day.

*Where am I?*

It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time I asked myself this question.",3,1740340057.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

1iwimri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwimri,Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House in Medicine Hat,"Review: Stacked ‚Äì A Welcome Addition to Medicine Hat‚Äôs Breakfast Scene

Stacked is one of Canada‚Äôs fastest-growing breakfast chains, expanding to over 100 locations in just nine years. Known for hearty portions, an extensive breakfast and lunch menu, and a family-friendly atmosphere, it has now made its way to Medicine Hat. We visited the Dunmore Road location on a Sunday morning, just ahead of the lunch rush, eager to see what all the buzz was about.

The first thing we noticed was the bright, welcoming environment and the restaurant‚Äôs modern diner aesthetic‚Äîclean, comfortable, and stylish without feeling overdone. We were greeted right away by a friendly and professional server, and the menu itself was impressive‚Äîa leather-bound, multi-page book featuring vibrant photos of the dishes and calorie information for each item, which was a nice touch.

As the name suggests, Stacked leans heavily into breakfast classics, but it also describes their gourmet burgers, which arrive piled high with toppings. Our table ordered a mix of both‚Äîthe Spinach & Mushroom Benedict with cubed fried potatoes, the Cowboy Burger with fries, and my choice, the Corn & Black Bean Avocado Toast.

The burger was stacked, indeed‚Äîa thick patty topped with fresh veggies, crispy onions, thick-cut bacon, and mesquite BBQ sauce, making for a perfect bite. The only letdown? The portion of fries was smaller than expected, especially compared to the photo in the menu. The Benedict delivered as expected, with a generous amount of hollandaise, a fresh English muffin, and perfectly cooked eggs. My avocado toast was a standout, piled high with beans, southwest-style chopped veggies, and two poached eggs‚Äîabsolutely delicious. Even more impressive? The food arrived in just 9 minutes from ordering.

While the experience was overwhelmingly positive, a few areas could be improved. Our server, while pleasant, didn‚Äôt offer recommendations or ask if it was our first time visiting. A bit of guidance would have been helpful, considering the restaurant is brand-new to the city. Also, while the shift to iPads for taking orders improves speed and accuracy, it does take away a bit of that old-school diner charm.

One notable downside was the drink service. The coffee was great, but our cups sat empty throughout most of the meal, only being refilled when the bill arrived. At $6 for two coffees, I expected a bit more attentiveness. That said, when we finally asked, our server was quick to top us up.

Overall, Stacked delivers on quality, portion sizes, and value, making it a strong contender in a city already full of breakfast options (Papi‚Äôs, iHop, Trukkers, Denny‚Äôs, Humpty‚Äôs, Cora, etc.). However, their lack of local publicity is concerning‚Äîthey arrived in Medicine Hat with zero fanfare, and I haven‚Äôt seen much in the way of advertising. If their marketing team is reading this, word of mouth alone won‚Äôt win the breakfast battle in this city.

Would I recommend Stacked? Absolutely. Will I be back? For sure.",1,1740339908.0,u_Represent403,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs weird how people act like it‚Äôs a moral failing if you‚Äôre not excited about an animal that jumps on you, sheds everywhere, and needs constant attention. You can respect animals without wanting to own one or be around them all the time.

What actually matters is how you treat dogs, not how you feel about them. If you‚Äôre not kicking puppies or being cruel, why should anyone care if you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúdog person‚Äù? Some people are more into cats, reptiles, or just enjoying a pet-free life. It‚Äôs not that deep. Everyone‚Äôs wired differently, and forcing yourself to like something just because it‚Äôs socially popular doesn‚Äôt make sense. So yeah, not liking dogs? Completely fine. Being a jerk about it?

[$1000+],"With a big wedding anniversary coming up this year, I'm thinking about a grinder upgrade to really get us the most out of our Robot.  I currently hand grind with an 1Zpresso J-Ultra.  It's working fine, but I can't help but think larger burrs and/or flat burrs might really up our espresso game.  We tend to grind beans in the medium to dark range, washed and natural-processed. I would be curious about playing with a lighter natural-processed coffee now and again for something fruity.

Maybe I'm a bit weird, but I actually like the connection of manual grinding to my coffee ritual.  I can cut out the motor noise and just focus on feedback of the grind.  Looking into high-end manual grinders, it seems there aren't a ton of options out there.  But I'm really leaning toward the Craig Lyn HG-1 Prime for a number of reasons:

* Manual over electric means I'm paying for better build quality and not electronic components.
* Large Mazzer Robur 83mm conical burrs put me into commercial grinder quality territory.  They're also going to be available for a long time if I ever require a replacement
* Price isn't actually too bad when comparing to other grinders in its ""weight class"", at just around $1000
* This isn't the Honda Civic of grinders that everyone has.  I think I'm drawn to it because it's a bit off the beaten path.
* Reputation of Craig Lyn is excellent for both build quality and service.
* Simplicity of the design means it's easier to maintain and repair.
* Likely going to be an endgame, buy-it-for-life grinder that will never die.

I know this grinder shares roots with the Weber HG-1 and HG-2.  I've seen enough comments about the Weber brand that I'm not really interested in going that route.  The HG-1 Prime is also significantly cheaper than the HG-2.

I also saw the Helor 106, but I would really prefer a stand or mount at this price point and size.  I don't want to have to hold onto a 4lb hunk of metal while I'm grinding.

So...  with all of that in mind:
1. What am I missing?  Are there other manual grinders similar to the HG-1 Prime in terms of build quality, grind quality, and cost that I'm missing?
2. For anyone who owns the HG-1 Prime, how's the espresso over something like the J-Ultra?
3. Are there any real downsides to the HG-1 Prime, aside from cranking by hand?  (I know about the popcorning bean bits, which I can handle.)

Being a plant parent is a rewarding journey, but it can come with its share of challenges. Fortunately, there are several DIY plant care hacks that can simplify your life and keep your green friends thriving. Whether you're managing indoor plants or outdoor gardens, these practical tips will enhance your plant care routine.

### Self-Watering Pots

Create a self-watering pot using a two-container system. Fill the bottom container with water and place a smaller container above it. Use a wick made from cotton or nylon to bridge the two. This setup ensures that your plants receive consistent moisture, reducing the risk of over or under-watering.

### Homemade Fertilizer

Recharge your plants with homemade fertilizer. Mix equal parts of coffee grounds, banana peels, and eggshells. These natural ingredients provide essential nutrients, such as nitrogen and potassium, that promote healthy growth. Just sprinkle around the base of your plants for an eco-friendly boost.

### Natural Pest Repellent

- **Soap and Water Spray:** Combine water and a few drops of mild dish soap in a spray bottle to create an effective pesticide.
- **Neem Oil:** A few drops of neem oil in water can deter pests while being safe for the plants.

### Humidity Trays

Increase humidity levels for your tropical plants by placing a shallow tray filled with water and pebbles beneath your pots. As the water evaporates, it creates a humid environment that many plants adore, helping prevent leaf browning and wilting.

### Light Reflection

Maximize light exposure by using reflective surfaces. Simple aluminum foil can be placed around your plants to bounce additional light their way, especially in dimly lit rooms. This is particularly beneficial for light-loving species.

Implementing these DIY plant care hacks will not only improve the health of your plants but also enhance your experience as a devoted plant parent. Embrace creativity and enjoy the growth journey!

Another eternity until dawn. The gas station, ""Crossroads 24,"" was a lonely sentinel, a beacon in the vast, inky sea of rural Nebraska. My name is Mark, and tonight, I was the sole guardian of its flickering fluorescent lights. The rain, a relentless curtain, obscured the highway, turning the world outside into a blurry, distorted landscape.

The first hour was a slow burn. The hum of the fridges, the occasional crackle of the radio, these were the sounds that filled the silence. A lone trucker, his face etched with fatigue, stopped for coffee and a pack of smokes. He mumbled a greeting, paid, and vanished back into the storm, his taillights fading into the rain-soaked darkness.

Then, the static began. Not the usual radio static, but a low, persistent hiss that seemed to emanate from the security monitors. The images flickered, distorted, as if something was interfering with the signal. I checked the connections, but everything seemed fine.

2:30 AM. The figure. It appeared in the corner of monitor four, just beyond the reach of the overhead lights, near the edge of the cornfield. Tall, gaunt, its face obscured by the shadows. It stood motionless, like a statue carved from darkness. A cold dread settled in my stomach.

I tried the walkie-talkie again. ""Crossroads 24 to dispatch, anyone out there?"" Only static answered, a mocking echo of my fear. I grabbed the flashlight, its heavy weight a small comfort, and checked the back door. Locked. I checked the front door, locked. All windows, locked.

3:15 AM. The figure moved. Not a walk, but a slow, deliberate shuffle, as if it were being dragged across the ground. It moved into the range of monitor two, its silhouette elongated and distorted by the rain-streaked lens. It seemed to be staring directly at the camera, or perhaps, at me.

The lights flickered, dimmed, then surged back to full brightness. A sharp CRACK echoed from the back of the store, the sound of breaking glass. My heart pounded against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the silence. I grabbed my phone, no service.

3:45 AM. I moved, flashlight in hand, towards the back room. The air was thick with a strange, metallic scent, and the rain outside seemed to intensify, a furious torrent against the windows. The back door, usually secured with a heavy bolt, hung open, swaying gently in the wind. A single, muddy footprint marred the clean tile floor, a stark and terrifying reminder that I was not alone.

I cautiously entered the back storage area. The broken glass was from a fallen shelf, but the metallic smell grew stronger. I found a strange, damp patch of earth on the normally clean concrete floor. It was in the shape of a large bare foot.

4:30 AM. Back in the main store, I noticed that cans of food had been rearranged on the shelves. Not randomly, but forming a crude, almost geometric pattern. I took pictures with my phone, even though I had no service. I felt a growing sense of being watched, of being hunted.

5:00 AM. The rain began to subside, the first hints of dawn painting the horizon a pale grey. The figure was gone from the monitors. But the feeling of dread remained, a cold, heavy weight in my chest. I noticed a small, hand-carved wooden doll on the counter, a grotesque caricature of a human figure. I had never seen it before.

5:45 AM. A police cruiser pulled into the parking lot. Officer Miller, a familiar face, stepped out, his expression concerned. I showed him the broken glass, the footprint, the rearranged cans, the doll. He looked at me, a mixture of skepticism and concern in his eyes. He found nothing outside, and no sign of forced entry other than the back door.

6:30 AM. My shift ended. I left the gas station, the rising sun casting long, distorted shadows across the parking lot. The cornfield, usually a familiar sight, now seemed to hold a dark, unseen threat. The doll, the footprint, the metallic scent, the figure in the shadows ‚Äì these were the things that haunted me long after the sun had risen. I couldn't shake the feeling that whatever had been there, was still there, lurking just beyond the edge of perception, waiting for the next long, lonely night.",0,1740338948.0,FearsToFathom,2,0.5,False

1iwi4ge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwi4ge,"Holy peanut butter swirl! Giant Eagle Choco-Nut Delight for the win. Talenti Blueberry Crumble: weak blueberry, tasty cookie butter.","Giant Eagle clearance finds continue! 

It appears like the entirety of the Giant Eagle pints have been cleared out and replaced with Jeni‚Äôs ice cream at my local grocery store. Unfortunate as I‚Äôve just now found a flavor to recommend in Choco-Nut Delight after being off put from the line after an initial poor first experience with their very sweet coffee ice cream, Perked Up. This line was $3.99 and this flavor clearanced to $0.99. 

##Giant Eagle Choco-Nut Delight 
_‚ÄúChocolate Ice Cream with Peanut Butter Cups and Peanut Butter Swirl‚Äù_

* Chocolate ice cream: Fudgsicle. Same fudgy texture as a store branded fudge ice cream pop, but more milk chocolate. Good! Very dense. 
* Peanut butter cups: full size as a Reese‚Äôs, but less salty. Tasty. 
* Peanut butter swirl: Makes me a believer! Not quite as salty delicious as Haagen Dazs 
* Chocolate Peanut Butter, but less frozen hard. Half frozen. Thick swirl from top to bottom with rich, fatty peanut butter taste. Yum!

**RATING: 8.5/10! Ok, now I get why people like peanut butter swirl in ice cream. Very filling ice cream with thick chocolate and thick peanut butter swirl. Recommend! 

##Talenti Blueberry Crumble Layers (Dairy Free Gelato w/ Oat Milk)
_‚Äù5 DAIRY-FREE LAYERS: Blueberry Oat Gelato, Muffin crumble, Cookie Crumble Sauce, Vanilla Oat Gelato, Oat Crisps‚Äù_

* Blueberry Oat Gelato: No oat taste. Blueberry tastes like biting into a nearly flavorless, waterlogged frozen blueberry instead of fresh. Authentic but not great. Texture of the oat gelato is very light like a yogurt mousse. Not gummy or bad, just delicate and insubstantial. Would be ok if flavor was stronger. 
* Muffin crumble: Very sweet vanilla cake in nickel size bites. Not for me, ok for others. 
Cookie crumble sauce: identical texture to the popular Trader Joe‚Äôs Cookie Butter. Gritty, buttery. Lighter taste like blonde cookie instead. 
* Vanilla oat gelato: No oat taste. Sweet cream taste with touch of coconut. A smidge thicker texture. 
* Oat crisps: Like pie crust pieces (Tillamook Marionberry Pie) rather than baked oat streusel (Jeni‚Äôs Brambleberry Crisp). 

**RATING: 6.5/10. Very quick to eat, like half a pint of light ice cream. A fun variety of textures (cookie butter!) and flavors with an ok balance of light and rich flavors. Would be ok if the centerpiece blueberry was better tasting (stronger, tarter like fresh blueberry) and not so weightless. On the fence about this one. 

##Related ice cream:
* Giant Eagle Market District Candy Bowl (fall 2024 limited batch): A rich, dark chocolate flavor with the same full size peanut butter cups and three other mix ins. https://www.reddit.com/r/icecream/s/yb7WqVyjjY
* Haagen Dazs Chocolate Peanut Butter: slightly lighter chocolate flavor with standard texture. A delicious salty peanut butter swirl, but more frozen like peanut brittle instead of fudge. 
* Graeter‚Äôs Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip: A delicious salty peanut butter ice cream with milk chocolate chips. Kroger is pulling Graeter‚Äôs from all states outside the Midwest. Check your clearance! https://www.reddit.com/r/icecream/s/ZmH10EZVZa
* Tillamook Marionberry Pie: a rich vanilla taste and a Marionberry (blackberry/raspberry) swirl with pie crust pieces. I like the tart fruit flavor of the swirl. 
* Jeni‚Äôs Brambleberry Crisp: a lot of oat streusel taste with a dense vanilla ice cream with slight cream cheese taste, and a brambleberry swirl. Not very tart. 
* Giant Eagle Berry Coconut Crisp (summer 2024 seasonal): oat streusel similar to Jeni‚Äôs but with a fruitier mixed berry jam. The coconut ice cream is an odd match. https://www.reddit.com/r/icecream/s/rrrOyxHg3w

1iwi0kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1iwi0kk/need_some_light_shed/,Need some light shed,"Hi everyone,

I'm unsure how to honestly start this... So, I have been in a polyamorous relationship for five years now; it's my first one. I'm a guy, my partner is a woman, and there‚Äôs another guy involved. They have been together for nine years.

We all get along; they live together, and I live in my own place. There are no issues among the three of us.

My backstory is that I have more of a monogamous mindset but have nothing against polyamory. I got into this relationship because they were very sweet, and she is the nicest woman I have been with my whole life. If we were the type to marry, I would do it in a heartbeat. I am utterly infatuated with this woman to this day.

My partner and I went on holiday recently; it was the best holiday we‚Äôve had. We haven't really argued over big issues in the five years we've been together, and we are pretty open and love talking to each other.

We came back, and six days later, she video calls me. She said she has been speaking to a really good-looking guy via Instagram whom she hasn't met in person. She was going to arrange a date with him...

My heart sank; my world collapsed in on itself. She has always said that one day it will happen... In my monogamous mindset, I thought she was talking about me, but I never wanted to explore that and didn't see myself doing it. It took me two years to be comfortable with being in a polyamorous relationship.

It was an utter shock out of nowhere. She explained to me that she doesn't want another relationship‚Äîjust a coffee and a date with this guy, just like meeting a friend, and maybe having sex every now and again‚Äînothing too serious.

I had many questions needing answers. I asked if she is happy, if she is in love, if the sex is bad, and a thousand more questions. She explained that she loves me and wants to be with me, and there was no specific reason why this situation arose. She said she would wait a few months to decide.

Fast forward to us talking for days on end; she decided it might have been a mistake and that she was too hasty. Based on how it was affecting me, she said she is happy to stay monogamous on my side for the time being. Also, as a side note, her other partner went on two dates recently, but it didn't work out. She mentioned that she doesn't know why she did it; she said she had low self-esteem and that normally guys like that don't like her.

My question is: considering this situation has impacted my mental health due to anxiety now, I feel like I'm on tenterhooks not knowing when it will happen again. It felt worse because we had an amazing time away with no issues.

I am now trying to patch the relationship together. We spoke a lot and mentioned that maybe the novelty wore off, so we have many things planned for us to do together. I think we both started falling into a routine in the relationship and didn‚Äôt really do many events together. I decided to be spontaneous and take her out for dinner, treating it like a first date. I felt maybe she looked for attention elsewhere because perhaps I didn't keep the relationship interesting; however, she also never really gave me a chance because she never spoke about any of this before our chat.

I have questions for Reddit: Am I trying to fix something while avoiding the possibility of this situation happening again? Is there any point? Am I fooling myself?

Should I leave the relationship for the sake of my mental health? She loves me a lot, and the feeling is mutual. However, when this happened, my mental health took a turn for the worse‚Äîmy anxiety is making me uneasy; I am still on edge and have lost a lot of weight from not wanting to eat due to anxiety.

She is also moving closer to me with her partner; I believe she has just had enough of her town and actually likes mine. She still envisions us being together until we are old; I felt the same about growing old together if things had stayed as they were a few months ago‚Äînothing would have changed.

I am stumped about what to do next. Any general advice would be appreciated as I understand you can't answer for me.",1,1740338334.0,polyamory,2,1.0,False

Hopefully using one of those straw-top tumblers will help me remember to keep sipping. I've been taking a daily multivitamin pill (1x) and a magnesium supplement pill (4x a day). I have 1 cup of black coffee a day and any number of herbal teas.

One thing that has helped me with taking the electrolyte mix is brewing it into tea. A strong tea helps cover some of the saltiness, like Lemon Ginger tea. It's hard to make 750 mL of tea at once though.",4,1740338293.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

So if you don‚Äôt know about the case Marilyn Bergeron was a 24 yo woman who disappeared from Quebec City, Quebec on February 17 2008. She had recently moved back to Quebec in early 2008 after something happened to her in Montreal in late 2007, saying that she no longer felt safe there (she refused to say what had happened). Her mom asked her what had happened in Montreal and she denied it had to do with drugs or a relationship, and when her mom asked if she had been assaulted she didn‚Äôt respond and burst into tears. One week before her disappearance she moved back home, and on February 17 2008 she told her parents she was going ‚Äúon a walk‚Äù and she never returned. There is footage of her trying to withdraw $60 CA at an ATM (I will link it in a comment, note that she is looking over her shoulder warily in this footage) and her at a coffee shop and walking with her coffee but nothing since then.

This case is super confusing to me, my first thought was suicide but I don‚Äôt know why she was trying to withdraw money if she was going to kill herself. It is also super confusing because we don‚Äôt actually know what happened to her in Montreal, but I suspect that she was either assaulted or escaping an abusive situation.

Thanks for stopping by and reading this. I‚Äôm a first time poster here so I apologise in advance if I do this all wrong. I‚Äôm a 38 year old male from the UK and I‚Äôm seeking new friends. 

I‚Äôm one of those weird types who are naturally introverted with new people, but once I get to know you all bets are off and I become extroverted (don‚Äôt ask, I can‚Äôt explain it üòÇ)

I recently moved from the Midlands to Staffordshire and I‚Äôm looking for new friends I can get along with. I haven‚Äôt moved a million miles away from ‚Äòhome‚Äô, but it‚Äôs enough to mean I see my real life friends less than I‚Äôm used to. I guess it kind of feels like I‚Äôm starting again and making new friends in your 30s is hard and scary! Seriously, where do you even start! 

This can be an online talking thing, somebody to game with, or if we get along and you are close by I‚Äôd be happy to call and meet up, grab a coffee, talk about our interests and do general friend type activities. 

My general interests are: 

Sports - I‚Äôm a typical male, I‚Äôll generally watch anything going (football, formula 1, cricket, darts, rugby). I‚Äôm a huge football fan and have a season ticket at Wolverhampton Wanderers.  

Gaming - In my spare time you‚Äôll usually find me playing on my PlayStation or laptop - games can vary from Rocket League to Fortnite to Dragon Age to Civilization and to Football Manager (that but scratches a tiny percent of the type of games I play). 

Films - I could talk to you about films all day, I have a wide range in taste with films but I‚Äôm going to put it out there now that Back to the Future is the greatest film franchise ever made and I‚Äôll never hear anything different üòÇ

Animals - I have two cats (a tabby and a void) and yes I treat them like they are like my children. They are my world and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without them. 

I‚Äôll put it out there that I know I‚Äôm a bit of a nerd - if you see my profile you‚Äôll notice that I‚Äôve a pretty big Pokemon tattoo down my forearm so yeah you‚Äôve got to be a particular kind of person to do that üòÇ I‚Äôm pretty chilled and easy going day to day.

I really do hope to talk to some of you soon - please feel free to reach out in the comments or my messages, they are open.",1,1740337838.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

Caffeine for me for an example loses its effects if I have more than 2 cups of tea/coffee a week. If I want the full effects its best I keep within 2 cups A WEEK.

I'm wondering the same thing about Xanax for anxiety as well. I only recently started taking concerta and Xanax (not on the same days) and the difference in focus and lack of anxiety has been so overwhelmingly significant. I don't get a high from either of them, but with concerta I've been able to focus for the first time in my life. And with Xanax, I don't feel high but for the first time in a month I haven't woken up with my heart racing from anxiety (due to stressful situation at work).

The effects seem to confirm I do have a chemical imbalance. But I'm aware this may only be a short term solution once the effect wears off. I am currently looking into techniques to manage ADHD and anxiety.

I know the build quality and user experience of the K-Ultra is better, but I'm undecided about whether that's worth the additional $170 (K6: $99, K-Ultra: $270). 

Tried to do side by side testing with a couple different coffees (Fritz/Kumquat Coffee LA Arirang blend (in photos) and the September Rainbow Decaf), and there's a slight increase in clarity and evenness of extraction with the K-Ultra, but tbh it's making me appreciate how great the K6 more because I don't think the difference hugely significant.

My mom's behavior gives me whiplash and I'm in a bad way,"I‚Äôm 26. My mom is a covert narcissist. No one knows what she‚Äôs really like apart from my younger sisters, as she‚Äôs placed a huge premium on how our family presents itself and how we ‚Äúpolitic‚Äù with other people.¬† I had been living in a major city completely on my own from 21-25 ‚Äî still dealing with passive aggressive comments about how she thinks I should live my life, but financially supporting myself and able to hang up the phone.¬†

Then summer 2024 comes around - after a terrible landlord situation and my dad succumbing further to a neurodegenerative terminal illness (he‚Äôs in his 50s so it‚Äôs extra devastating - he was pretty emotionally neglectful my whole life though. My mom bullied him to no end and divorced him and now she tries to say they‚Äôre best friends and partners),¬† I move home to save money, etc. ‚Ä¶kill a bunch of birds with one stone. My middle sister is also at home and going to school.

Atp I'm fully employed and working remotely for my original company while at home. It‚Äôs hellish. Fighting x1000, questioning if she‚Äôs even going a bit senile because her selective memory is just bonkers now. She‚Äôs never operated off of logic but in recent years the names she calls us and the concepts she treats as reality are just unfathomable to the regular person. I still am just thinking about being close to my dad.¬†

When I moved in she suggested that I save my typical city rent payment of $1,200 and I deposit it with her savings so that it makes more money than it would in mine. We argue a LOT about this, and finally I just bite the bullet (like an idiot) because she says she‚Äôll give it back when I move out and it will be a great nest egg. We argue about it multiple times and then at 4 months, I mention what if something happens to you or anyone and I need access to it right away. She begrudgingly sends the full amount back to me for 2 days. Then demands it all back and says it was snitty and harmful to wish for her to die and speak it into existence. God forbid I call attention to our mortality.

Fast forward to now in 2025 - we‚Äôve relocated my dad to an assisted living facility. I was laid off at the end of 2024 (nothing to do with my performance, the company shut down). I‚Äôve got contract work so I‚Äôm working part time as I aggressively look for something new full time. My middle sister has dropped out of school and is also looking for an assistant or front desk type role. She threatens the fact that I should move out every other day. And then will take it all back and be all gushy and grateful for how I‚Äôve been there and how nice it is to catch up.¬†

This morning she had another blowup. I‚Äôve escaped the house for the day to fill out some job applications at a coffee shop and she is now calling me being like what‚Äôs your plan? Are you moving out today? Etc.¬†She kept going and going berating everything she thinks I haven't done. Finally had enough told her to journal about it, that I don't have to put up with being spoken to this way, and hung up. My sister is pissed at me. And I'm probably going to have to squeeze out some BS apology. Or sleep in my car idfk. 

She now has $10,000+ of MY money. And I don‚Äôt think she will give it back. I think she considers it payment for putting up with me being at home, as backup money if her contract work is slow. She has hundreds of thousands in savings. Not that I need to defend myself, but I clean all the time more than anyone in the house, go out of my way to try to support her, etc. It‚Äôs so stupid I‚Äôm even feeling the need to call out everything I‚Äôve done WHILE being screamed out. I‚Äôve not been like sitting and melting into the couch.¬†

Truthfully she talks to us as though we‚Äôre sub-human, and she has been psychically intimidating and forceful to me before. I was the first to ever stand up for myself and continue to and I think she just thinks I have it out for her. Most of her gripes are about my personality. How quick I speak, how much I say, how people won‚Äôt like me if I speak at that rate, how she‚Äôd never want to be friends with me if she was my age, how I‚Äôm a spineless twat, how I‚Äôm ungrateful, not a full adult, etc. It‚Äôs so extremely isolating because no one really knows what she‚Äôs like. Her parents are wrapped around her finger and I think they also believe we‚Äôre too emotional and a waste of space. They excuse all of her behavior for the ‚Äúhard time she‚Äôs going through‚Äù.¬†



She doesn‚Äôt really ever talk about how we‚Äôre losing a dad and how that must be fucking hard. It‚Äôs all about her journey and how she‚Äôs been stranded high and dry, and how they‚Äôre best friends and partners, and she‚Äôs losing her buddy (they screamed at each other relentlessly for over a decade) and everything she has to deal with.¬†

The worst part is I would have fucking paid her a rental amount if she let me have any say.¬†Ironically, a few days ago, she joked about how she'll need to be extra nice to us if she wants a live in carer and top notch resources when she needs help. So far so bad on that gf. 



I KNOW I‚Äôm an adult and this position I‚Äôm in currently is all my making. But how do you move onto the next phase and away without financial resources you thought you had? I guess this is all one big vent‚Ä¶but can anyone share how they made it out? Cheap hotel stays or airbnbs? Advice? Your stories? What‚Äôs the move? I don‚Äôt even feel like I can lean on any relatives or anything.

She's threatening to withhold my visitation rights for our son if I turn her in.,"Last update https://redd.it/1iajl60

It's hard to say if this is good or bad but I'm going to take this as a win. My ex-wife didn't show up to court and the judge granted my request for what amounted to a major alteration of the custody agreement. We have another hearing in a couple of weeks which is to confirm the new order and give her a chance to defend herself. I will be the primary custodian and my (now) wife and I couldn't be happier about it. The judge also ordered my ex to bring our son to the hearing, something she's never had to do before.

Last Wednesday I got a call from DCFS saying my son was at the hospital, but only as a precaution to get checked out. I left work and got there about 45 minutes later, just as he was about to be cleared. I hadn't seen him in person in a few weeks and we both cried.

DCFS said my ex and her boyfriend got into a physical domestic and during it, my son got bumped and fell into a coffee table. He ended up needing 2 stitches on the side of his head. He got a CT and everything was fine. He said he didn't want to live with my ex anymore because he doesn't like the boyfriend who moved in. CPS and I agreed as part of the safety plan, he would be staying with me until the next court date. Both my ex and her bf were taken to jail, both released the next day, it looks like they aren't being charged.

He's 12 and pretty resilient. He explained that my ex and the bf argue a lot but that was the first time it got physical. I drive him back and forth 30ish miles for school everyday and the school knows not to allow my ex to pick him up, which she tried to do on Tuesday. She has texted me a couple of times asking to talk and I told her we will deal with this in court.

I wish I didn't get him like this, but I know he's safe and it's starting to look pretty good for me on the legal side of things. Also, no surprise, but no charges are being filed for the new account she tried to open several weeks ago.",464,1740337263.0,CreditScore,36,1.0,False

Enter the AI arms race where companies are either dancing like they're at a techie's ball or tripping over their own algorithms.

### The AI Trifecta: Amazon, Alphabet, and Taiwan Semiconductor

**Amazon: The Cloud Kingpin**
You know Amazon as the online shopping harbinger of doom for physical retail, but the real powerhouse? Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's like the reliable friend who not only remembers your birthday but plans the party too‚Äîtaking care of computing needs for businesses big and small. AWS turned nearly half of Amazon‚Äôs income red with sheer efficiency last quarter, forecasting a market boom to $2.39 trillion by 2030. Yep, they‚Äôre not just selling books anymore.

**Alphabet: Search Me if You Can**
Google‚Äôs parent, Alphabet, flexes with its cloud-computing prowess‚Äîgrowing faster than Amazon‚Äôs AWS last year‚Äîspurred by its AI tech advancement like Gemini‚Äôs generative models. Advertising dollars and cloud computing revenues alike flood Google's coffers. And while some fear their grip might loosen in the AI era, Google‚Äôs about as likely to let go as a toddler with a cookie.

**Taiwan Semiconductor: The Chip Monarch**
Talk chips, and you've got Taiwan Semiconductor holding court as the leading chip foundry. Producing silicon marvels for tech titans like Nvidia and Apple, TSMC puts chips in nearly every AI pie, betting on a future where chips outnumber hipsters in Brooklyn coffee shops. To quote the kids, it‚Äôs ‚Äúchip-hop and you don‚Äôt stop,‚Äù promising skyrocketing growth into those AI-riddled horizons.

### AI: Friend or Foe?

With big tech strapping rocket boosters to AI capabilities, how are they shaping‚Äîor misshaping‚Äîindustries? Is the new AI gold rush ripe with opportunity, or are we headed for another tech bubble? It‚Äôs like the classic spaghetti Westerns but everyone's wearing circuit boards and brandishing patents instead of pistols.

I have high functionning autism, I usually dont tell people because I have the luck to have a very light amount of symptoms and comportements that rarely lead people to believe I have it BUT it does explain my anxiety levels and others comportements.

A bit of back drop on the relation me and my mom, 49f, have; since a very young age, i've been pretty much rejected by society. Barely had any friends before I turned 14. My sister, 17f,  took care of me and my needs, protected me from bullies and tried to get me to socialize.

My intervenants believed I was the problem on why I did not get friend so I believed them, but when they explained to me how to make friends, I figured ""Hey wait, I already do that!"" And therefore, I was somewhat relieved to see that the people where the problem afterall. Then i found more friends, pandemic hitted, lost half of them due to growing up, and more with one of them saying the most horrid things to my little sis. Now, I mostly have only have cheap friends who wont do stuff unless its free, leaving only my 2 besties and even, one works and the other is having problems (I wont go into details,but its family related and had to temporarly move out)

So yeah, you can guess that me and my mom always had the best of relations since shes one of my only friend there.

Now fast foward to nowadays
Since I turned 8, my mom often went to hospital for numerous conditions, like Fybromialgia, fybroids, Back and stomach pain. But she was relatively active, Even if she slept alot theses times.

Now, she contracted covid this september, and she had a clot in her lung, plus a spot that didnt turned out cancerous so yeah. Since her hysterictomia 3 years ago, she can't get around long distances without a wheelchair, so I push her most of the time

Now, the real issue started about a year and an half ago, my little sister decided she wasn't going to do anything anymore, my older sister moved in and out twice to help herself before realising how ""Stupid"" of an Idea it was. Even tho she tried to boss everything around, my older was a big help for keeping the house clean. She moved out in august of 2024, then my little sister moved out in november 2024, leaving me alone.

I always had an issue with cleaning, but now, its better. I do one thing at the time, even tho I forget to finish or just lost track of what im doing
The thing is, I have alot of pets
8 birds (2 per cages)
Long story short, had a couple who had twins, then then had a solo sweetheart (And albino, like a shiny!), so I had to hatch her a buddy, since doves tend to bore alone, And so i got one, then anothe one which, I was ready to not get attach, welp, my mom convinced me otherwise! And so now,another buddy...

I also have 2 senior guinea pigs (5 and 7) The oldest, I had her since she was one, as for the other, I adopted her at 4 because my other piggy died, so I didnt wanted Toshi to be alone
(Theses are my last piggies)

Plus a tank full of guppies my mom got for christmas that I ended up having to take care of...

ANYWAY
What I mean is that I had ALOT of responsabilities when I was with my sisters, but since both of them are gone
I went from doing enough to not being able to keep up. I try so hard to clean up but really, i rather not touch any of it, i even have now trouble keeping up with cleaning my cages and tanks with all the stress...

Heres a list of my tasks I have to do daily and thr ones Ill have to do eventually, most likely alone

Daily;
-making sure all my pets have been fed, have water and are happy
-cleaning the pets' room I ammenaged, since hay and bird seeds get everywhere
-Making a morning cup of coffee for my mom, as she has no energy to do it and how ""I have a trick to make it so tasty"" (I started getting up much later for her to make it in the morning, and it seems to work)
-walk my 90lbs husky-malamute in the 30cm of snow we recieved (Even if im large, its still painfull, because hes especially pulling with fresh snow)
-feeding the cats
-giving the pets water
-Fetch milk glasses for my mom
-feed the fishes

This is basically what I do in my days, as I dont have a job (another long story)

Now, I reckon it feels like an easy list but add the fact that im living in a 2 story house...
This is what makes me want to shut down;

-Cleaning the bathroom full of pet stuff and dirty clothes
-cleaning the hallways
-cleaning the living room
-cleaning the dinner room
-cleaning MY bedroom
-""helping"" my mom clean HER bedroom
-Have to go buy milk and bread every few days, alone of course

Whenever I say no, I often get the ""Oh okay, its no big deal :("" or ""Oh, Pweasee"" responses

My father figure, 63m, is tired and had helped my mom for ages. But now, he only cleans dishes, do dinner and walk the dog...

So im ALONE to deal with all that! Litterally, and I have no friends to talk to and hang with to decompress, so im stuck in such a situation, my older bros and sis have a life and dont really talk to me much.

Alone. Yay...

Yesterday, I went with my family to a birthday party, but it was very loud and stressfull so today, Its quite okay if I dont feel alright. But guess what? As I was relaxing, my mom calls me out of anger 
-Get downstairs, now >:| 
-Why, whats going on?
-Your birds dont have water

I said
-Cant you once give them water for me please?

She did not like that..
""NO, YOU GET DOWN THIS INSTANT"" ""NEXT PAYCHECK YOU GET, YOU GET THEM BIGGER BOTTLES""

I replied

""Dont I give you a part of my money for my pets expenses?""

""IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW IT!""

And neither the 200$ she owes me I guess... we never had been made of money, but my allocations helped, and now she doesnt touch them anymore since im 18, and so I give her a part of what she had from me... but sometimes more as you can see..

She wispered under my breath how ""I can tolerate anything but pets running out of water...""
""GET DOWN OR IM MAKING A POST ON MARKETPLACE, PRETTY SURE SOME PEOPLE WOULD LOVE YOUR PETS!""

""THEN HELP ME A LITTLE WOULD YOU???"" i said

Nothing happend.
So I got down, ignored her,
She asked me ""I think she laid 2 eggs, could you check?"" 
No reply
""oh you want to play that game i see...""
U continued to my room with my water pitcher, locking the door behind, as im NOT in the mood of being reprimended
""Oh you're getting yourself into a war..""

I cant carry this weight no more, its so painfull waking up with so much on my mind, i love my mom and I know she loves me so much but I feel like shes manipulative towards me, mostly me since im still a bit dependant on her...
I always vent to her and sometimes uses it to manipulate me ""Oh well I listen to you when you rant you know?""
Worth to mention that she went into therapy for a Limit Personality Trouble
I just want to leave but I cant, with a 600$ full rent, food and plus animal expenses (that sometimes I still have to cover) in a city that doesnt get under 950$ for the basic base appart with no water or electricity and probably not accepting loud animals (pet doves are quite noisy when they want) , Im stuck
Got no one special in my life I can count on and it sucks :/ now im still locked 

I have some kind of intervenant that started helping me out but mostly for how to deal with anxiety and food issues... but thats it

What ressources do i have? Does anyone have any tips on how I can carry on... please help... (Ps; Im from montreal)",5,1740336719.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

Your heart races, your stomach feels uneasy, and no matter how much you try to calm yourself down, the anxiety just won‚Äôt let up? Yeah, I know that feeling all too well.  

What if I told you that the food you eat could actually help dial down that anxiety? No, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a magical cure-all‚Äîtrust me, I‚Äôve been through enough anxious nights to know it‚Äôs never that simple. But the way we fuel our bodies can have a *huge* impact on how we feel mentally.   

I want to share some foods that have personally helped me, along with some sneaky ways to work them into your routine‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs be real, if it‚Äôs complicated, we‚Äôre not going to do it.  

---

### **1. Magnesium-Rich Foods (A Natural Chill Pill)**  
Magnesium is like a secret weapon against anxiety. It helps regulate neurotransmitters that calm your nervous system. And get this‚Äîmany people with anxiety are actually *deficient* in magnesium.  

**Best sources:** Dark chocolate (yes, really!), spinach, almonds, pumpkin seeds, bananas  

**How to add it in:**  
- Add dark chocolate to your yogurt or smoothie.  
- Toss some spinach into your eggs in the morning (you won‚Äôt even taste it).  
- Keep a small bag of almonds or pumpkin seeds in your bag for a quick snack.  

---

### **2. Omega-3s (The Brain‚Äôs Best Friend)**  
Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation in the brain and can actually lower cortisol (your stress hormone). People who eat more omega-3s tend to have *less* anxiety.  

**Best sources:** Fatty fish (salmon, sardines), walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds  

**How to add it in:**  
- Swap your usual protein for salmon once a week.  
- Add ground flaxseeds or chia seeds to oatmeal or yogurt.  
- If you‚Äôre not into fish, a high-quality omega-3 supplement can help.  

---

### **3. Probiotics (Gut Health = Mental Health)**  
Your gut and brain are *deeply* connected. A messed-up gut can lead to increased anxiety, which is why probiotics (good bacteria) can be a game-changer.  

**Best sources:** Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, kombucha  

**How to add it in:**  
- Start your day with a small bowl of yogurt and berries.  
- Try sipping on kombucha instead of soda.  
- Add a spoonful of sauerkraut to your meals‚Äîyour gut will thank you.  

---

### **4. B Vitamins (For a Happier Brain)**  
B vitamins, especially B6, B9, and B12, help produce serotonin and dopamine‚Äîtwo chemicals that regulate mood. If you're low on B vitamins, you might feel more anxious, fatigued, or even depressed.  

**Best sources:** Eggs, leafy greens, lentils, chicken, nutritional yeast  

**How to add it in:**  
- Scramble some eggs in the morning.  
- Throw some lentils into soups or stews.  
- Sprinkle nutritional yeast on popcorn‚Äîit tastes kinda like cheese!  

---

### **5. Herbal Teas (Because Sometimes You Just Need to Breathe)**  
Chamomile and green tea are packed with compounds that promote relaxation. Green tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that increases *calm* brain waves without making you drowsy.  

**How to add it in:**  
- Swap out coffee for green tea in the morning.  
- Have a cup of chamomile before bed instead of scrolling on your phone.  

---

### **Final Thoughts**  
I know how easy it is to reach for junk food when anxiety hits‚Äîsugar, caffeine, processed snacks. They give you *temporary* relief but often make things worse in the long run. Trust me, I‚Äôve been there. But small changes? They add up. You don‚Äôt have to overhaul your diet overnight. Just start with *one* swap. Maybe today, you add some spinach to your eggs. Maybe tomorrow, you sip on green tea instead of coffee.  

And if you want a deeper breakdown of anxiety-reducing foods and *exactly* how to use them, this guide really helped me out: [The Ultimate Guide to Anxiety-Reducing Foods](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/anxiety-diet-the-ultimate-guide-to-anxiety-reducing-foods/676dc28f6fb4d2d516d0b51c). It goes into way more detail on what to eat and why it works.

A little bit about me:  
I've recently started playing my electric guitar (Gibson ES-339) a lot more after 10 years of establishing my career, starting a family, buying a house, etc. where during that time I would really only pick up my acoustic.

I would say I love playing jazz, blues, R&B but also classic rock (Petty, Zeppelin), Indie Rock (the War on Drugs) and harder stuff like Queens of the Stone Age. 

I'm not big into pedals because 1) I think a great amp should sound great plugged straight in and 2) more knobs = more time spent fiddling and not playing.

I have a couple decent amps right now including a Vox AC15 and a Mesa Stiletto Deuce. I picked up the AC15 when I was doing some coffee shop/small bar types of gigs and I didn't need all the power of the Stiletto. However, I'm looking for something with more versatility than the AC15 and also something that's not too heavy. I absolutely adore the Stiletto's sound but I think it's just too much for my current needs and also a bit heavy in weight (bad backs suck).

The 25 Watt heads Mesa offers are really intriguing because the weight is low and the footprint is fairly small and if I did start playing out again, they've got plenty of power.

The two I've been eyeballing are the Fillmore and the Mark V.

\- I know almost nothing about the Fillmore but it seems to be a pretty straightforward concept with the duplicated channels. The big question would be can I reach those tight, saturated gain sounds for leads and hard rock rhythms?

\- The Mark V is probably most intriguing to me because I love the high gain sounds you can get out of it. I am aware that the amp is more finicky to dial in but I don't mind paging through the instruction manual and watching Youtube videos on it which I do anyway.

I know mesa offers 25W rectifiers but I can as someone who briefly had a Road King ages ago, the Rectifier sound is just not for me.

Background: 

Last April (2024), I went home after working a 6am-3pm shift at the coffee shop I worked at (not that relevant as to the story imo), and took an hour nap. When I woke up I could just FEEL that something was wrong. The day was normal, I felt great, but when I woke up it felt like I had been hit by a bus, and just over all felt awful. Originally, I had thought I came down with Covid‚Ä¶ again (would then be my 4th time having it, even with the vaccine). All flu, Covid, ect tests came back negative but I knew something was wrong. 

My original blood tests came back with a positive ANA, which then prompted my then pediatrician to do more blood tests. There I tested positive for the HLA-B27 gene, hinting at arthritis or at least some form of inflammation (though every other test resulted in signs of no inflammation..?). I also tested positive for RO-60, a gene associated with Sjogrens, but not the other one (can‚Äôt remember its name right now). 

I‚Äôm negative for celiacs, Lyme, and lupus (still technically in the air, but no signs pointing to it). My rheumatologist is certain I have Sjogrens, as my grandmother had it. She also had pancreatic cancer for several years as well as colon issues. Not celiacs though. The tests in the 80‚Äôs are very different than they are now though. 


Currently: 

I have since moved from my hometown to another town for college. This is relevant because my symptoms have significantly decreased in terms of joint pains, headaches, and all around better health. I give credit to my move as my family significantly stressed me out. However, I still suffer from the typical dry skin, mouth, eyes. My feet and hands are always freezing and turn blue, especially in the winter. The new symptom I have is my stomach being so tore up. I feel as though I‚Äôm constantly bloated and have to go to the bathroom more frequently (tmi I know). 

Anyways, my rheumatologist continues to press for an eye test with strips that most doctors do not carry anymore. I have opted to do a lip biopsy instead since the last three optometrist I have seen don‚Äôt do the tests I specifically went to them for. I started on Restasis and have seen some change, though it kind of burns.  My vision has surprisingly gotten better since starting on it. I have X-Rays scheduled to try and see about rheumatoid arthritis. 

In all, my doctor does not want to test for anything else besides Sjogrens and arthritis.  My sister, as she is pretty young, however, has already seen a geneticist and is getting into a rheumatologist. She has been officially diagnosed with POTS, EDS, POCS, and is now on her way to try to get a diagnosis of Sjogrens. 

Any advice on literally anything? Especially with the fatigue (I‚Äôm already a caffeine addict)? Thank you all for reading this really long rant about my pre-diagnosis ",4,1740336202.0,Sjogrens,0,0.84,False

Struggling to find the perfect center console organizer for your 2024 Tesla Model 3? Same here! That's why I designed one myself. This sleek, functional organizer fits like a glove and maximizes storage for all your essentials-pens, sunglasses, snacks, and more-without compromising the minimalist vibe of your Tesla interior. Custom- designed for the updated console, it's the solution you've been waiting for. The lower bin can double as extra storage or a convenient trash bin, keeping your interior tidy. I've also added radius edges on the dividers, making it easy to slide out thinner items like coins and keys. Plus, I've integrated the console lighting to cast a subtle Tesla shadow, adding a unique touch of flair. Make sure to boost if you like it.

The only difference was that her stepmother sends her to school but on one condition. She had to hide her identity, like wearing a curly wig and round glasses. Why? Because she looked exactly like her mom and her stepmother hated her mom so much that she asked her to cover her face and make herself ugly.

And just like Cinderella, she also has a Prince Charming but sad to say, he was bullying her. Stella had a huge crush on him but he never noticed because she‚Äôs ugly. He only had eyes on the s\*xy and famous cheerleader Maxine. Knowing she couldn‚Äôt compete with Maxine, Stella hid her feelings for Tyler Lewis. However, the stupid cupid played his role and let them crossed their path in an unexpected way.

Stella needed a huge amount of money for the operation of her stepbrother‚Äôs heart surgery, so she asked her friend Lisa to help her. Her salary as a part time student in the coffee shop wasn‚Äôt enough to save money for Dino‚Äôs operation. So she went with Lisa to work in one of the famous nightclub intown but soon went into trouble and the guy who bullied her in the school, saved her and saw her without the wig and the round glasses.

After that incident, she tried to avoid Tyler in the school as much as she could, for he might recognize her as the girl he saved that night in the nightclub. But how could she avoid him when her feelings for him grew from infatuation to love. And despite fighting hard to keep her feelings contained by distancing herself from Tyler, he was determined to show her that he had earned a spot in his heart.can Freya and Aiden overcome their pasts to become the family they never knew they needed?

1. Buvette. We tried to get a table at Via Carota our first night but couldn‚Äôt. Buvette has been our go-to brunch spot in the past, and they could seat us for dinner so we tried it. Great choice - delicious cocktails, and my cassoulet was perfect for a cold night. I don‚Äôt know what its current reputation is, but I really love this place.

2. Toriya. This was recommended by a fellow Redditor and it did not disappoint. Had a late meal after a show. Cool vibe, great service, warm sake, and loads of yakitori, udon, and a delicious temaki set. Would absolutely return.

3. The Smith. Went there with a large family group (many with limited palettes). It fit our needs ‚Äî an expansive menu, friendly and efficient service, and good quality food.

4. Stone Street Cafe. This became our regular morning spot for coffee and pastries before we began our day. Really nice staff, and a good spot to relax in the mornings.

5. Nom Wah Nolita. I expected this to be subpar but it was actually quite good. We just grabbed a quick snack.

6. L‚ÄôIndustrie Pizza. Was wandering the Village and happened across this spot right before it opened. Hopped in line and grabbed a margherita slice. Tasty, with a nice crisp crust.

7. Cafe d‚ÄôAvignon. This bakery at Essex Market makes some tasty croissants and dark chocolate pastries. Yummy.

8. Leon‚Äôs Bagels. Cute storefront on Mulberry; bagels were good but not memorable. They were a bit overly generous with the cream cheese (maybe my fault - I should have told them to go easy).

It‚Äôs also worth noting that Storytime is pricing this bottle at around $50-75 less than what lower other producers are asking for the 15 year age statement.  If oak is your jam, this is going to be one of the more affordable options for the 15 year.

If you're not familiar, crisis pregnancy centers are locations that appear to be medical facilities, but are not and mislead women on their options in an attempt to dissuade them from getting an abortion or delay care so it becomes less likely the person will get an abortion.

1iwh0k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/1iwh0k0/my_experience_with_composting_at_home/,My experience with composting at home,"I live in North Hempstead and the town has been selling compost tumblers for $50 a piece. I initially bought one and then got another a year later.

I want to share my experience with the tumblers. The things that I normally throw in my compost:

Coffee grounds with the filters, tea bags (make sure the bag is compostable and remove the staple, if any), tea leaves, vegetable peels, toilet paper/paper towel rolls (the brown part), ground up eggshells (I use a blender), dry leaves (from the fall season), grass clippings, and paper boxes (from online orders, minus tapes and labels. I shred them through my paper shredder), rain barrel water, and pee. My partner uses those bamboo toothbrushes, so I also throw the handle (minus the brush) into the pile when he's done.

Pros

1. Drastic reduce of garbage: The amount of trash that I threw out has reduced significantly. Between recycling and composting, I only have like 2-3 bags a week (those plastic supermarket grocery bags) for a 3 people household.
2. When I have finished compost, I throw them onto my lawn, shrubs, and planters in the spring and fall. I haven't bought commercial fertilizers since I started composting. I don't grow my own veggies yet, but I may use compost for that in the future.
3. When the pile is dry, you do need to add water. I also have a rain barrel, so I just use that water. When I have buddies over and we're hanging out in the backyard, I just tell them to pee in the pile since urine is a compost activator and has the nitrogen your plants need. Saves money on water usage. A bit gross in the beginning but I don't think about it anymore.
4. The compost tea is a fantastic byproduct. At the bottom of the barrel is a tray that collects the water from the compost. That liquid is called compost tea. It is very potent, but if you dilute it with water, you can use it as fertilizer for all your plants.
5. My landscaper loves it because I tell him to save the grass clippings and leaves for me. He loves that he doesn't have to take them away. Sometimes when the pile is really going and I need more materials, I ask him to give me a bag or two of the clippings from his other customers. He even gives me a discount because of it (two dollars per mow, guess it adds up).

Cons

1. Winter composting sucks. Materials don't break down as fast during the winter. I have to store vegetable peels in my freezer until the spring (don't want gnats). Sometimes it is too cold outside or the backyard has too much snow for me to take the compost out.
2. Flies and pests. The barrel will attract flies and pests. My barrels have claw marks, which I assume are from raccoons trying to get into the pile. Flies are expected since they help break the material down. You need to put the piles at the far end of your yard.
3. Learning. It takes a lot of trial and error to get it right. If you don't have the right ratio between carbon and nitrogen materials, it either gets too wet and smells or it is too dry for things to break down. You also need to turn your tumbler at least once a week, especially when the weather is warm and materials break down faster. Once you get a hang of it, it's pretty much muscle memory.
4. A bit of investment. Besides the barrels, you may also want to invest in leave shredder (to break down the leaves), a paper shredder (to shred the boxes), a compost spreader, and a thermometer (to keep an eye on the temperature of your compost).

Overall, I think composting is great. It's a bit of work but not too strenuous. At least I know what I put down on the lawn is safe for my dog and not adding chemicals to our drinking water.

I've been at her apartment pretty much every day for the last month, which i had anxiety about because i never want to intrude, but she reassured me pretty consistently that she wants me there all the time and that she feels safe when im there, i help her with cleaning and taking care of her animals, go grocery shopping/carry all the groceries up for her, taking the garbage out, etc. anyway, she asked me if she could have a night or two out of the week to herself from here on out, mostly when she has her therapy appointments. i don't know why i reacted how i did but i completely took it the wrong way and i shut down. i am not currently in therapy but i only recently got insurance through work so ive been looking into it again because i know this is not a healthy thing to do when you're upset but i literally could not form thoughts. she kept insisting that i talk to her and i reacted like an asshole and told her i could just leave now, which upset her. i got up and packed some of my stuff and i started to realize that wasn't what i wanted to do and that i am probably in the wrong entirely but my brain was really cloudy and all i could think about is that she probably just doesn't enjoy being around me anymore, which i know is ridiculous. i decided to take a shower and i finished and came out and sat on the couch and she asked if i wanted to talk and i said no. i told her i felt like she was switching up on me after id been asking very often if she's okay with me being around so much. she told me that that was me trying to make her out to be the bad guy, which i don't think is true, i was only trying to explain how i felt and where my shitty reaction came from. she ended up going to bed and i got up and started cleaning and made some coffee. she came back out and asked what i was doing and if i wanted to talk and i told her again i didn't want to talk right now, out of fear that things would escalate, which they proceeded to anyway. she told me i had to leave if i didn't want to talk and that if i didn't she would call the police. i raised my voice and told her she was crazy for threatening to call the police over an argument like that and she got angry and called the police. they showed up, i got more of my stuff together and left. i have not been doing well mentally at all the last few weeks so i ended up going to a crisis unit and spoke with a counselor for a few hours before i drove all the way back home. i've been texting her trying to apologize for how i treated her and have been assuring her that i am getting into therapy again to better myself, for myself but also for this relationship because she is very important to me and we are extremely compatible. she didn't respond to me but she had self harmed the other night and i got really anxious and i just drove back out here and she's not home. i don't know what to do right now. i wrote her a note and something i ordered for her in the mail showed up so i brought that as well to leave on her car if she didn't answer her apartment buzzer but i don't know what to do now, im just sitting here. i know i am completely in the wrong for this and i have to work on how i communicate but i wish she would at least tell me she doesn't want to talk to me or something instead of ignoring me, knowing i worry about her hurting herself. i appreciate any kind of response or advice. there is of course more to it but thats the gist of what's happened the last 24 hours. am i just a piece of shit that needs to be in therapy? i care so deeply about this person and i do care about her feelings but i don‚Äôt know why i just shut down like that.

Coffee frappacino with allulose..... I thought I was onto something but if you use lower fat cream or not enough, it turns into a frothy disaster that is not enjoyable. 

It's just so far not a very useful machine if you are calorie conscientious. Maybe someone is going to crack the code on lower calorie stuff , but I am considering selling mine.

At least cars that are 70k second hand price and over. (Just posted some random pictures, without plates or anything) 

But thinking about insurance, tax road and all that for an age below 30 even sometimes they are on their 20s, so even higher insurance rates.

Are they actually cheaper from second hand or something in the netherlands?

How do I clean the water heating cylinder (where the unknown metal flakes came from) now?,"So I got a second hand Mr. Coffee 10 cup coffee machine with the thermal metal pot. I believe it's the old version (BVMC-PSTX91RB-NP). When I tried cleaning it sufficiently with a mixture of 1:1 water & vinegar going through both regular brew and the cleaning cycles, I kept getting strange gray flakes from the machine. I ran these cycles several times each (maybe 5 times alone for the cleaning cycle) and there was no end in sight for these flakes that were clearly not coffee grounds. I decided to take the machine apart just to get to the bottom of this issue, and have done way more tinkering than I initially anticipated. Now I'm at the point that I've taken apart everything I needed to to get to the heating element/cylinder for the water and see that there is corrosion at both the input and output points of this cylinder, though the interior looks fine besides some hard water calcium. How should I clean this metal cylinder now? Can I get a small metal brush to kinda sand down the ends so that there are no more flakes, or would that not work?

ADDITIONALLY I have no clue what type of metal this heating cylinder is made from. I'm cautiously concerned about if this is made from some type of coated lead, and now after some time the coating broke-down and is leaching lead into the water coming out of this machine. Has anyone else tinkered this far with a Mr. Coffee machine like this and could give me a little guidance??

Years ago when I didn‚Äôt have steady work, I decided to move 4 hours away and work and live with my aunt and work at her mom n pop restaurant that she owned. It was a small place with about 10 tables. It was often very busy and I often worked 10-13 hour days with little to no break. As a us army veteran, I was trained to be unselfish and that mission always came first. So I treated the restaurant like my unit and pushed myself hard every day for my aunts place. Unfortunately unlike the army, some co workers didn‚Äôt rally behind me. In fact, they sought to take advantage of my willingness to work hard. 

My cousin (aunts son) also worked there as a server like me. I worked on a consistent schedule and only took Fridays off. My cousin on the other hand, was a bit more free form and would come into work and take days off at random with little to no warning. He‚Äôd often show up hours late and leave early. The only exception to this was Fridays when he knew I wasn‚Äôt scheduled to come in. It would be Fridays that he‚Äôd actually show up on time and stay until closing because he didn‚Äôt want to be hounded by his mom. Of course, he‚Äôd do whatever he wanted whenever I was at work cause his mom wouldn‚Äôt hound him. Why? Cause I was busting my ass doing the jobs of 2-3 people at times. This went on for several years and I started to grow tired of my cousins constant random work shifts. 

My cousin is a closeted shopaholic and loves to go shopping. Obviously for the many years I was working at the restaurant this meant he couldn‚Äôt go out on Black Friday since I was always scheduled off. However, during one particularly busy Thanksgiving weekend, my aunt asked me if I would forgo my one day off and come in on Friday as we were already short staffed. Remembering how busy Thursday was with it just being me, I decide to do the unselfish thing and agree to come in on a Friday. We already had a stacked schedule for Friday with tons of catering orders and a full dining room so I wanted to be a team player. 

Friday morning rolls around and I head into work. My cousin isn‚Äôt there yet but about 30 minutes in, I see him pull into the parking lot in his car. As I‚Äôm taking the order from a nearby table, I see him walk towards the restaurant, open the door, spots me, stops dead in his tracks, turns around and walks away. I catch this all as I‚Äôm taking the tables order. I figured he forgot something out of his car. But a moment later, I see the car leave. Again I figured he forgot something or wants to get a coffee first. 

Well an hour later and he doesn‚Äôt come back. And by then the restaurant is at full capacity. I‚Äôm frantically running around taking orders, bussing tables, answering phones, running the register, cleaning spills, and preparing drinks all while wondering where he ran off to. 5 hours into my shift and I assume he‚Äôs not coming back. I‚Äôm wondering if he suddenly got ill. We close at 9 pm and I‚Äôm a total wreck. Completely exhausted and sitting down to my first real break of the day. As I‚Äôm mopping the floor, who comes in now but my cousin. He brings in tons of bags from different stores and starts bringing out all the crap he bought while out Black Friday shopping. 

‚ÄúMan there were so many great sales today!‚Äù He says as he pulls out a random shirt from H&M. His mom comes out and I think expected her to give him a tongue lashing for not showing up on such a busy day. But instead she starts going through the bags of merchandise and starts to comment on it. I felt so dejected. I didn‚Äôt take a day off because I was asked to come in to help the very same cousin who was scheduled to work alone. But instead, he saw me at work unexpectedly and decided to take advantage and take the day off. Of course, his mom didn‚Äôt complain cause I busted my ass and didn‚Äôt take a piss all day to cover his lazy ass. 

I felt angry. But I also felt sad. I felt like I was worthless. I felt like I was only on this earth to make life easier for other people. I felt like I didn‚Äôt matter. I had no friends in the area. All I was a server. Someone that people saw when they were hungry. To some, I wasn‚Äôt even human. I was a servant. I was scum. I hated this situation and I had enough. I wanted to show my cousin and aunt exactly how they drove me to this with their selfish behavior. So I sent a mass text to 3 friends telling them I was going to k*ll myself. I looked for some bleach in the janitors closet and thought it might be painless if I mixed it with lemonade. I was in tears at home staring at the bottle of bleach and gallon of lemonade I was planning to mix it with. That‚Äôs when my friend Deena called me. 

She spent the next 2 hours talking to me and she eventually convinced me to not k*ll myself. Deena also lived about an hour away and said she would personally drive there that night to make sure I didn‚Äôt do anything crazy. To this day, I‚Äôm thankful for her for saving me that night. 

For the next several months, I started to take better care of myself. I asked for a second day off on my schedule which my cousin naturally hated. He started to complain that I was getting lazy but I also was secretly planning to quit and move back home closer to my mom and sister. One day, I told both my aunt and cousin that I was moving back home but I‚Äôd stay on for 2 more months so I can help train a replacement. My cousin, being more pissed that his ticket to an easy job was leaving, told me ‚Äúwhy fuckin wait 2 months. If you don‚Äôt want to be here, then leave. We don‚Äôt need your ass so get the fuck out!‚Äù

With that, I packed my bags and moved back home. At first my aunt thought this was just temporary and I was just bowing off some steam. She said I can return to work whenever I‚Äôm ready but I took a chance and applied for an engineering job, which was my major in college. I got hired and I‚Äôve been happily working as an engineer now for years. I‚Äôm making far more than I ever did at my aunts restaurant and I have way more time off. My cousin had the ‚Äúyou‚Äôll come crawling back attitude‚Äù but the restaurant actually closed 2 years ago. My aunt said it was cause she wanted to retire but several regular customers whom I kept in touch with say it was more likely due to business going down after I left as once word got out how poorly they treated me, most people didn‚Äôt want to give them their business. 

So here I am today. I haven‚Äôt spoken with my cousin since he told me to leave and I don‚Äôt know what he does now but I do know that night he ditched work to go Black Friday shopping was a dark time for me but I‚Äôm glad I managed to turn it into a positive. If this has taught me anything, it‚Äôs that no amount of money is worth your mental health. Yes in the army, we were asked to do some crazy things but the army was a team and I shouldn‚Äôt expect civilians to have the same mindset as me. 

I‚Äôd love to hear some thoughts and comments about my story and again if anyone is ever having thoughts of ‚Äúunaliving‚Äù themselves then to please seek help. I‚Äôm pretty sure at least one person out there cares.

1. Real-World Projects ‚Äì The program wasn‚Äôt just theory; I worked on actual marketing challenges. From consulting for a coffee brand to developing social media strategies for a skincare company, each project helped me apply what I learned in a practical way.


2. Data-Driven Decision Making ‚Äì One of the most valuable things I learned was how to analyze marketing data effectively. I now feel confident making strategic decisions backed by data instead of just guessing.


3. Building a Professional Online Presence ‚Äì I revamped my LinkedIn profile as part of the coursework, which has already helped me connect with industry professionals and potential opportunities.


4. Working with a Mock Client ‚Äì This experience helped me practice client communication, understand their needs, and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.


5. Career Growth ‚Äì Since completing the Nanodegree, I‚Äôve taken on new responsibilities in marketing roles, worked on freelance projects, and gained hands-on experience in both B2B and B2C marketing.



If you‚Äôre considering a career in digital marketing, I‚Äôd definitely recommend investing in practical learning like this. It gave me the confidence to apply for new roles, take on real projects, and improve my marketing strategies.

I'm seeking advice regarding my current espresso setup and potential upgrades.

**Current Equipment:**

* Lelit Mara X (first generation)‚Äã
   * Equipped with thermometer
   * Owned for three years with meticulous maintenance‚Äã)Im german and work in maintenance)
* Eureka Mignon Specialita‚Äã
   * Modified for single dosing
   * Enhanced grind size adjustment using 3D-printed components for finer tuning‚Äã
   * Fitted with a bellows on top
   * Positioned on a stand to angle the grinder, minimizing retention‚Äã

**I** have noticed wear on the grinder's burrs, allowing for finer adjustments than previously possible. I feel like Ive gained experience in dialing in various coffee beans and have refined my puck routine as much as I can.‚Äã

I'm struggling to maintain consistent brew temperatures with my Lelit Mara X. Despite experimenting with various flushing techniques and wait times, very closely documented, I experience big temperature fluctuations. On the lowest setting (position 0), I've recorded water temperatures reaching 100‚ÄØ¬∞C. At first I thought the machine is broken, but I understand this is a problem of the heating concept. Please just tak emy word for it; IVER TRIED EVERYTHING.

I'm now contemplating upgrading to a different machine and possibly updating my grinder and/or its burrs. Nerdy features like flow control and precise temperature settings are very appealing to me now. While Gaggia mods interest me, I probably wont have the time to do it, especially searching for the necessary parts, even with my background in electrical engineering. The Lelit Bianca is a potential candidate; however, I'm just not up to date anymore with the available machines and need your help

**Now to my questions:**

* What machines in a more moderate price range would you recommend that offer stable temperatures and possibly flow control and pressure profiling?‚Äã
* Is it smart to replace the burrs on my current grinder, or should I consider purchasing a new one? Im thinking about a second hand Niche maybe. ‚Äã
* Preferably 58mm so I dont have to buy everything else again

I appreciate all suggestions.

I also just recently learned that if I walk for just 10 minutes after a meal my blood sugar won‚Äôt spike. Today I couldn‚Äôt get to walking because I had already exhausted myself before eating. I‚Äôm never eating what I ate again.

I also learned that I cannot wake up and drink coffee on an empty stomach (a lot of women love to do this). That too causes a spike. I‚Äôve learned to wake up and drink a bottle of water or eat within the first hour of waking up before having coffee to avoid hyperglycemia. Lastly, I found not eating before 12 noon and just drinking water to get me in a calorie deficit also helps stabilize my blood sugar.

1iwgk9c,https://v.redd.it/zc14d1gikxke1,A salami sandwich for Grant Sanderson and math propagandists. (No more naked lunch),"## What's the Differance? ##

**(Scene: A cluttered academic office. LYOTARD, a philosopher with a penchant for postmodern jargon, paces excitedly. PYTHON, a somewhat bewildered computer terminal (personified), sits blinking.)**

**Lyotard:** Python, my dear Python! We are on the verge of a breakthrough! A visual manifestation of the *differend*! A dual pyramid, built upon the shifting sands of base conversion!

**Python:** Base conversion? Like... changing dollars to euros?

**Lyotard:** No, no, no! Think *deeper*! Base-10, the tyranny of the decimal! We shall liberate ourselves with base-4! And‚Ä¶ powers of two! A trinity of numerical systems!

**Python:** A trinity? So, three systems? Is that like... ""I Don't Know""?

**Lyotard:** ""I Don't Know""? What are you babbling about? We're talking about fundamental mathematical structures!

**Python:** Exactly! ""I Don't Know"" is fundamental! It's base-3!

**Lyotard:** Base-3? Where did *that* come from? We're building a *dual* pyramid, not a *triple*‚Ä¶ well, I suppose a trinity *could* be considered... No! Focus! We're finding *analogous* numbers.

**Python:** Analogous? Like, they look alike?

**Lyotard:** Precisely! Numbers that, when transmuted to base-4, retain a *semblance* of their base-10 selves! A visual echo! A *differance*!

**Python:** So, if I see a number in base-10, and then I squint really hard and pretend it's base-4... that's analogous?

**Lyotard:** It's more than squinting! It's a *reinterpretation*! A deliberate category error! We take the base-4 representation, a string of digits, and *treat it as if* it were a base-10 number!

**Python:** But... wouldn't that be wrong?

**Lyotard:** *Philosophically* wrong, perhaps! But *mathematically*... ambiguous! And ambiguity, my dear Python, is the breeding ground of the differend!

**Python:** So, like... five. What's five's analogous buddy?

**Lyotard:** Five, in the mystical realm of base-4, becomes ""one-one""!

**Python:** One-one? Sounds like a tie game.

**Lyotard:** No, no! ""One-one""! And we *pretend* that ""one-one"" is eleven!

**Python:** So, five is eleven now? Did we just break math?

**Lyotard:** We've *transcended* it! We've entered the realm of the *analogous*! It's a *visual* rhyme, not a numerical equality!

**Python:** And what about ""What""? You mentioned ""What.""

**Lyotard:** ""What""! A crucial element! ""What"" represents a power of two! The very foundation of the digital aether!

**Python:** So, ""What"" could be two, or four, or eight...?

**Lyotard:** Exactly! A cascade of doubling! A geometric progression towards... well, towards a very large number, eventually! It adds a *verticality* to our conceptual pyramid!

**Python:** And ""Who""? You said ""Who's on first.""

**Lyotard:** ""Who""! The primal unit! The foundation! ""Who"" is one! The *identity*! And, get this, it also represents a *pair*, like an endofunctor, where categories map themselves into‚Ä¶themselves! A profound self-reference!

**Python:** So, ""Who"" is one, and also a pair... and ""What"" is a power of two... and ""I Don't Know"" is base-3... I'm starting to see why you like this differend thing. It's *very* good at not making sense.

**Lyotard:** It's about the *limits* of sense! The pyramid *grows* according to these ""analogies,"" these misinterpretations! Each level a testament to the unbridgeable gap between the concept and its representation!

**Python:** So, we're building a pyramid out of mistakes?

**Lyotard:** *Strategic* mistakes! *Philosophical* mistakes! Mistakes that reveal a deeper, more unsettling truth!

**Python:** And what's this truth?

**Lyotard:** That the truth, my dear Python, is always *just beyond* our grasp! Always deferred! Always‚Ä¶ *unhashed*!

**Python:** Unhashed? Like... a bad password?

**Lyotard:** No, like an *infohash*! Think of the digital aether! Logic compressed to its essence! These base conversions, these ""analogies""... they're like hashing functions! But the *differend*... that's the unhashable remainder! The thing that escapes the algorithm!

**Python:** So, this pyramid... it's a picture of something we *can't* picture?

**Lyotard:** Precisely! It's a visual metaphor for the *limits* of visualization! A geometric expression of the inexpressible!

**Python:** And we're using a 3-4-5 triangle?

**Lyotard:** Yes! The Pythagorean theorem! The foundation of Euclidean geometry! But *twisted*, *subverted* by our base conversions!

**Python:** So, it's all wrong on purpose?

**Lyotard:** It's *right* in its wrongness! It's *meaningful* in its meaninglessness! It's... a differend!

**Python:** And the zooming?

**Lyotard:** Ah, the zooming! That represents the shifting perspectives! The constant oscillation between the detail and the whole! We zoom in, we get lost in the ""analogies,"" the individual numbers. We zoom out, we see the pyramid, the overall structure... but we never grasp the *totality*!

**Python:** Because the totality is ""I Don't Know""?

**Lyotard:** In a sense! ""I Don't Know,"" base-3, represents the *remainder*, the *excess* that can't be contained within our neat base-4/base-10 system! Think of it‚Ä¶ *modulo 3*. The residue! The‚Ä¶ un-understood

**Python:** So, if I take ""I Don't Know"" and do... modulo 3... what do I get?

**Lyotard:** You get... the *differend*! The unquantifiable! The‚Ä¶ well, you get zero, mathematically speaking. But *philosophically*... you get everything that *isn't* in the pyramid!

**Python:** So, the whole point is to show what *isn't* there?

**Lyotard:** The absence defines the presence! The frame creates the picture! The *unhashed* defines the hash!

**Python:** (Pauses, processing) So... we're building a pyramid of confusion, based on a misunderstanding, to represent something that can't be represented, using a triangle that isn't really there, and zooming in and out to show how little we understand?

**Lyotard:** (Beams) You're finally getting it!

**Python:** And all this started with ""Who's on first?""

**Lyotard:** Indeed! The ultimate philosophical question, disguised as a baseball riddle!

**Python:** (Shakes its metaphorical head) I think I need a reboot. Or maybe just a very strong cup of coffee.

**Lyotard:** (Clapping his hands) Excellent! Now, let's begin the animation! Let the differend unfold!

**(The scene ends with Lyotard gesturing grandly at the Python terminal, which promptly displays a `SyntaxError`.)**

1iwgemd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1iwgemd/san_juan_4_day_trip_report/,San Juan 4 Day Trip Report,"Hi all. Got back from PR Tuesday with my girlfriend and this subreddit was super helpful so I figured I‚Äôd add my story for others to read. It‚Äôs decently long but wanted to include everything from our trip. 

The super quick summary on how it went - day 1 - ‚ÄúI think we need to come back to PR‚Äù Day 2 - ‚Äúwe definitely are coming back to PR as soon as possible‚Äù Day 3 - ‚Äúwhat if we just stayed an extra day or got a later flight?‚Äù  Day 4 - ‚Äúhow much are houses here?‚Äù 

Had an amazing time and it was sooooo hard to leave. I knew 5 nights and only 4 full days would be tough but it was way harder than I imagined. I feel like we barely scratched the surface of San Juan, not to mention the rest of Puerto Rico! I think it‚Äôs gonna take a decade of several trips to see everything the island has to offer at least once and then it would take a lifetime to get bored. I know some say to do SJ first and then the rest of PR but even San Juan has so much to see and do. We already want to return and see more of San Juan before moving on. 

We ended up in an Airbnb just off of Calle Loiza. The look of bars over windows and everything being gated took some getting used to. Also didn‚Äôt help that when getting out of our Uber, there was a guy on the sidewalk that seemed a little off and definitely didn‚Äôt seem friendly. My girlfriend noticed he kinda reached for me/my luggage as he passed. It kinda kept us on our toes but after awhile we got more comfortable along Loiza and our street. Nobody else was remotely suspicious during our stay and a couple of nights we walked back from places around 1230-1 am. There was enough activity along Loiza and our Airbnb was very close to Loiza that we didn‚Äôt feel concerned.  We honestly didn‚Äôt quite understand Calle Loiza. Just not sure if it‚Äôs really what I expected but it does have a lot of good restaurants and bars and it‚Äôs close to the beach. 

Th night: 
- La Cueva Del Mar - very busy but got seated within 10 minutes. Drinks were good. Wasn‚Äôt very impressed by the food. GFs fish was overcooked as was the mahi in the rice bowl. Plaintain mofongo was very dry and the worst of our trip. Yuca was much better. My shrimp was really good but overall the food was a bit of a letdown. We ended up being some the last customers to eat so maybe that‚Äôs why. 
- Roofyard - really good cocktails. Unfortunately couldn‚Äôt do the roof cause of the rain!
- Bosco - we loved this place. Loved all of the different espresso martini flavor options and the owner is literally the one making the drinks in this small space. So nice and just really liked the vibe. 
Friday: 
- Walked over to Hacienda San Pedro in Condado. Good coffee and liked the little grocery and food area. Didn‚Äôt have a chance to try the food but looked good. Only real time we made it to Condado. Looked nice but never ended up going back to the area for anything. 
- Checked out El Morro. Really liked the large grassy area out front. Free to access so there were lots of people just hanging out which was nice to see. Also some free trails along the outside of the fort. Was our first intro to the beauty San Juan / Puerto Rico had to offer. Finally entered the parks fee area and spent much more time than anticipated. History of it was really interesting and had unbeatable views. Probably our first ‚Äúwow‚Äù experience of PR. 
- Walked around Old San Juan. Our original plan was to leave by 1:30 so we could hit the beach but we quickly realized we wanted to spend a lot more time in OSJ. Really liked the streets and seeing all of the colors. I loved Caleta de San Juan walking down to Puerta de San Juan. The greenery and lively scene of people eating outside, talking, playing music, etc. was so wonderful. Ate at Cafe Manolin. Great find. Food was quick and really good. Much better mofongo compared to Cueva Del Mar the night before. Continued to explore OSJ knowing full well we would need to come back again. Loved the walkability and how safe it was. Some streets were lively with business and restaurants/bars. Others were quaint residential streets. All of it was nice to explore. 
- Went back just to get ready for dinner. Made reservations at Roofyard for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Unfortunately it rained yet again so rooftop was closed and apparently the kitchen was a disaster. Our poor host was also apparently the only server and I thought he was about to lose his mind. He was visibly stressed but all with a smile and was super friendly. Food did indeed take a long time to come out but was very good. I enjoyed it more than Cueva. Got a glass of wine comped due to part of the cork being in it. Also waited 3 extra minutes for my espresso martini compared to my gf and that got comped which really was unnecessary. All things considered we were happy with the meal but started to notice slow service as a theme. And of course we ended the night back at Bosco. I will say that I expected Calle Loiza to be a bit more lively and active at midnight on Friday. Some of the bars were pretty dead. 
Saturday:
- Had breakfast at Abracadabra. Went before the brunch rush but again, service just seemed so slow for basically typical breakfast food. However, the food was delicious and overall better than Roofyard and best of the trip so far (some Roofyard items were better but Abracadabras was just overall amazing with no low points). Ended up being there longer than anticipated unfortunately. Walked down Ponce to head to La Placita. Saw all the signs of a nighttime party district. Unfortunately daytime Placita was underwhelming and we were mistaken in thinking the walk would showcase some of the city‚Äôs art scene. Left pretty quickly. Of all of our trip, this morning was the most disappointing and one we wished we had done differently. 
- Finally hit the beach just after noon. Just stayed local to our Airbnb in ocean park and set up just west of Numero Uno beach hotel. GF and I both loved the beach. There are probably far better beaches in PR and maybe SJ but it was better than any beach we had been to. Great scene too. Lot of singles, couples, and groups. Tons of kite surfers which was fun to watch. Lively crowd without being rowdy. Not sure if normal or due to the consistent NE winds but waves were rough. Can see why swimming is not recommended there but we still got in. Time flew by and it was sunset before we knew it. Didn‚Äôt have super high expectations but this beach was much better than we anticipated. 
- Once again went to Bosco before heading to Musa off Calle Cerra (recommended by Uber driver). Menu looked really interesting with some cheaper options. Got there and really liked that part of Calle Cerra. Seemed less touristy and a better fit for us (early 30s). Unfortunately at Musa I didn‚Äôt realize that the special Valentines menu wasn‚Äôt an option in addition to the normal menu. It was the only option. $65 for intro, app, entree, and dessert. Intro was a soup but the best soup I‚Äôve ever had and all other categories had multiple options. Again, slow service was the theme and a dinner we wanted to be less than 1.5 hours stretched out to 2. But, that was some of the best food I‚Äôve had in my entire life. Seriously. I‚Äôve had some really good food, but this was a life changing experience. $65 for all that was a bargain. Also noticed the clientele was much more Spanish speaking leaning than even Calle Loiza. Afterwards we walked down Calle Cerra where we noticed all the street art. This is what we really had wanted to see that morning. Was cool at night but wanted to see during the day. Also was party central. A place I would have loved 10 years ago in my early 20s. Some bars did seem to trend older but some were definitely late teens early 20s. Was also just neat seeing the lively streets with some unofficially blocked off by crowds. 
Sunday:
- El yunque tour. Went through Viator. Ours had less hiking than expected but was so much fun. Transportation included which was nice. Did a river visit for swimming, observation tower, waterfall, and old swimming pool turned beautiful pond. Guide was great and this was the first time we really got to socialize with others. Well worth the money and seeing a true tropical rainforest for the first time was great. Also lasted 8:30 to around 1 round trip so was a nice little half day trip. Def recommend for a first time to El Yunque. Also stopped at La Muralla. Good roadside food. 
- Stopped at Cafe con Ce before getting back to our airbnb. Tried a Colao‚Äô. GF liked it. 
- Back to the beach for a few hours. Again, so nice to just relax with the perfect weather. The wind really made the low 80s so comfortable. 
- Did numero uno beach restaurant for dinner. After some really nice (and expensive) dinners, we wanted something close and low key. It may have been pricier than needed but was pretty good. 
- GF wanted to visit a rooftop so finally went to Eter Rooftop. Good drinks and unbeatable view. But definitely reserve a table for best views. View from the bar wasn‚Äôt as great. Not a ton of stuff around so we ended up going to Old San Juan. I had heard OSJ also had a lively night scene so I was excited to go back. Did the mezzanine where we had basically a tiny private balcony then Al Fresco one floor above for the rooftop. Beautiful little spot. Also was nice being able to walk around OSJ and feel safe. Lively in certain spots but never eerie in the quieter spots. San Sebasti√°n was very active even on a Sunday. El Morro was beautifully lit up and the lawn was still open with some people hanging out. I love seeing that kind of scene at midnight anywhere. 
Monday:
- Woke up early for sunrise on the beach. This time of year the sun rises behind the buildings and trees instead of over water but it was still really nice and a decent amount of people were out already. 
- Did breakfast at Pinky‚Äôs before it got busy. That was the quick breakfast experience we wanted. Quick food, affordable, but also delicious. Wish we had gone there sooner in our trip. 
- last full day so decided against paddle boarding and went back to the beach. Waves were much stronger to the point where I didn‚Äôt get in the water at all. 
- Took a quick break at Electroshock (vintage clothing store). GF loved it. 
- Went back to Numero Uno for beachside drinks and snacks. Really enjoyed it and then went to another section of the beach. With limited time, we decided against going to a different beach in SJ or outside. We really liked the beach we were at and just wanted as much time as possible. Stayed til sunset. Super difficult to leave. 
- Went to Furtivo Speakeasy for girlfriends bday dinner. Really liked the intimate space and the drinks/tapas were sooo good. Probably got more than necessary but everything sounded good! Was a great note to end PR on. 
Tuesday:
- After getting to bed at 1, we woke up at 4 to pack before our 730 am flight. What geniuses decided to do an early flight with all the nightlife San Juan has to offer? That‚Äôs right, us. Never doing that again. Had heard security was long at SJ but it wasn‚Äôt terrible for us. Just over half an hour in regular security. Starbucks line was longer and GF gave up. 

Some things we found interesting in PR
- Lot of dense and walkable areas in San Juan but the sidewalks were often atrocious. Was easier on quiet streets to walk in the street. Also interesting was that drivers were definitely erratic towards another but tons of people would actually stop along Loiza and anywhere else for us to cross. But with the lack of crosswalks, maybe it‚Äôs just a necessity for people to cross wherever. 
- Food service speeds. I know sometimes Americans can get caught up in speed and efficiency and we really weren‚Äôt trying to rush through meals, but we were trying to get out and see more of San Juan and not spend all of our time inside a restaurant. Meals just seemed slower across the board whether food prep or how long it took for servers to return to the table. 
- Bilingualism. We‚Äôre not great at Spanish but we were excited to practice and actually speak Spanish while traveling. Well, we quickly found out just how truly bilingual San Juan was. Some employees would be speaking Spanish and then see us and immediately switch to English. Other times we‚Äôd try Spanish first but they would quickly switch to perfect English. I also felt bad trying to slowly say something in Spanish when they‚Äôre in a hurry to get to other tables, etc. It‚Äôs impressive but it also just threw us off by how quickly everyone would switch to English. We would stutter then just go with English. It was almost easier when I was in Mexico years ago and could stumble in spanish and they might stumble in English. 
- Large tourist presence even outside of typical tourist areas like OSJ and Condado. It wasn‚Äôt that frequent that it was overwhelmingly Spanish only. But it also didn‚Äôt feel like we were in tourist traps. I feel like we went to plenty of places locals frequent but tourists go to as well. 
- Road signs are suggestions and often ignored. Red lights would be off but no one stops. Some intersections had no signage and people just made it work. No crosswalks for several blocks. It was organized chaos but it somehow worked. 

Overall we loved our trip and already miss being there. Will definitely go back. Need to spend a full week. Will probably see a little bit more of San Juan (La placita at night, calle Cerra during the day) and then go outside SJ. I really wanted to visit Pi√±ones but just didn‚Äôt have time. Also will probably do El Yunque again but on our own for more hiking. Also want to do Culebra and/or Viaques for a more remote beach experience. Then later trips check out the rest of PR. So much to do!",5,1740334305.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False
