1oe4byu,https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1oe4byu/multiple_company_multiple_laptops/,Multiple Company Multiple Laptops,"How do you handle the situation where multiple clients (say J1, J2, J3, J4, J5) all want to give you their own laptop? You could use an HDMI matrix or a similar setup, but that defeats one of the biggest perks of our job: the freedom to work wherever and whenever we want. Nobody‚Äôs sitting in a coffee shop juggling four laptops! üòÑ

Another issue is location flexibility. Some UK companies let you work on an outside IR35 (B2B) contract, which usually means you can work wherever and whenever you like. But their internal policies can be more restrictive, for example, only allowing you to work from abroad for up to four weeks a year.

I honestly don‚Äôt understand how they can impose that in a true B2B arrangement. The contract is with your company, and even though you did the interview, in theory you could send a substitute. So how can they tell you to stay in the country?

The answer often seems to be that they issue you a company laptop. That way, they can simply say the device isn‚Äôt allowed to leave the UK. It‚Äôs a clever way to enforce control, but it also takes away a lot of the freedom that‚Äôs supposed to come with contract work... of course they use their VPN too, so you cannot act like you were in the UK etc",1,1761228710.0,overemployed,2,1.0,False

Personality wise we suit each other quite well and we have a satisfactory sex life but activity wise she has no interest in doing anything, i always ask her to go for coffee, for walks, to go shopping, the beach and just about anything else you can think of but the vast majority of the time all i get is ""not today"", ""im too tired"", ""you always ask at the worst times"" the latter being particularly untrue since ive asked her to do things every way imaginable 

The only times she does seem excited to go out is if im driving or if we're going to the pub. Furthermore she has no desire to begin a joint savings account, which ive explained would help us save for things much easier and buy much higher quality items for our child and hopefully one day our own house but then gets annoyed sometimes when I won't go half-halfs with her when buying something 

She's asked me multiple times over the last 2 years if I ever plan to propose to which I always say ""not until we have everything else out of the way, weddings arent cheap"" but she doesn't have any drive to sort everything else out first

I feel like im getting off topic so in a nutshell, i feel like me and my girlfriend have different aspirations in life and im unsure if I should stay with her or not, presently we do love each other but I dont want to end up miserable as I get older either

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Denver Nuggets vs. Golden State Warriors: A Tale of Two Kitchens**

The Denver Nuggets and Golden State Warriors are set to clash on October 23, 2025, in a season opener that‚Äôs less ‚Äútitle showdown‚Äù and more ‚Äúwho‚Äôs bringing the dishwashing detergent?‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a referee‚Äôs whistle and the humor of a halftime stand-up special.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The Warriors are favored at -130 on the moneyline, implying a 56.5% chance to win. The Nuggets, at +210 decimal odds (‚âà47.6% implied probability), are the underdog, despite holding a 12-2 edge in their last 14 meetings with Golden State since 2021. The spread? Warriors -2.5, which feels about right given Stephen Curry‚Äôs habit of launching 15 three-pointers per game and the Nuggets‚Äô tendency to let opponents tie their shoelaces mid-dribble.

The total is set at 234.5, suggesting a high-octane affair. Denver‚Äôs preseason offense (120.8 PPG) and Curry‚Äôs 37.6%‰∏âÂàÜÂëΩ‰∏≠Áéá (three-point percentage) could turn this into a popcorn shootout‚Äîor a kitchen fire, depending on who‚Äôs cooking.

---

### Injury Report: Missing Ingredients

The Warriors are missing **Moses Moody** (calf) and **De‚ÄôAnthony Melton** (knee), two key defenders who might as well have been drafted for their ability to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù while limping. Without them, Golden State‚Äôs defense resembles a sieve that‚Äôs been told a bad joke‚Äîpermeable and slightly embarrassed.

Denver, meanwhile, is fully stocked with its ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù (Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr.) plus new additions like Jonas Valanciunas, who‚Äôs here to prove he‚Äôs not just a Lithuanian man with a sweet jump hook and a suspiciously high tolerance for Draymond Green‚Äôs trash talk. The Nuggets‚Äô depth? So deep, even their seventh-string point guard could probably draw up a play to isolate Jokic for a post fadeaway.

### Recent News: Curry‚Äôs Coffee and Jokic‚Äôs Robot Diets

tl;dr:

* The best money rails are onchain, on Polygon
* Stable, near-instant, and low-cost, Polygon is the infrastructure payment service providers need to thrive
* Polygon is so easy to build on that many consumers that use popular apps like Polymarket don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre on Polygon
* The network is scaling to meet surging demand

https://preview.redd.it/7nl12ll1bvwf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f172842e310c134302f7d6ad82c86e9f78dc8c

Your money today is stuck in line at the bank.¬†

Sending it across borders means paying high fees and waiting days for settlement‚Äîplus the feeling that you have to rely on a string of intermediaries who profit off your hard work.¬†

Now imagine the process without banks, without delays, without enormous fees. That‚Äôs the promise of onchain payments‚Äîand Polygon is delivering. Send and receive money as easily as a DM.

For the past fifteen years, blockchains have promised peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer finance. But only recently, with a series of payments-focused upgrades for Polygon, has infrastructure matured enough to make real‚Äëtime payments feel like the internet.¬†

Stablecoin volumes on Polygon in Q3 hit all time highs, at $3.4B, and volume was up to 287M, a 21% quarter over quarter increase. Institutions and startups alike are betting big on crypto and integrating on Polygon, including Stripe, Revolut, Nexo, Reliance Jio, and BlindPay. 

And then there‚Äôs Polymarket, the first real breakout crypto app. Built and grown on Polygon, Polymarket alone has seen nearly $20B in predictions volume, is the official prediction market for X, and just raised $2B in funding.

All of this indicates something true: there is real momentum for onchain payments and digitally-native money more broadly. This trend has people wondering: Why payments, why now, and what‚Äôs next?

# Why payments?

Traditional payment rails weren‚Äôt built for a digital, global economy.¬†

Legacy systems batch transactions, rely on closed ledgers, and charge fees that seem invisible until you need to send money across borders. Worse, settlement can take days, meaning funds remain ‚Äúin transit‚Äù and tied up in capital‚Äëinefficient float. For individuals sending remittances or merchants trying to manage cash flow, these frictions are a barrier to true global scale.

Onchain payments on Polygon solve this.¬†

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT0 represent one‚Äëfor‚Äëone claims on fiat currency and settle on instantly and irreversibly. When you pay someone on Polygon, the transaction finalizes in seconds and costs fractions of a penny. There are no intermediary banks and no cut‚Äëoff times.¬†

* **For businesses**, this means lower operational costs, better margins, immediate liquidity, and programmable financial flows.¬†**‚Äç**
* **For consumers**, it means owning your money and moving it freely.

Polygon‚Äôs ecosystem has grown into one of the largest stablecoin hubs because it combines high throughput with low fees.¬†

Recent upgrades bring the network new dimensions of speed, lightness, and reliability‚Äîeverything you need in a chain focused on payments and programmable money.

With this foundation, payments on Polygon feel less like a cassette player and more like a streaming platform.

# Why now?

As Polygon scaled Ethereum, it became a natural gateway for onchain financial activity.¬†

From payments to predictions, Polygon cemented itself as the money rails bringing the next era of digital-native finance.¬†

And core developers leaned in.

Bringing the world global payments means a network that is:

* Light
* Fast
* Low-cost, and¬†
* Easy to build on

Every upgrade to Polygon in the last year is a step to doubling down on these qualities longterm so that as demand scales, so does the infrastructure to meet it.

The Rio upgrade transforms Polygon into a faster, lighter, and more resilient network built for payments at scale. With a new block production model, Polygon can now reach up to 5,000 transactions per second, delivering near-instant finality and eliminating the risk of reorgs entirely. Validators benefit from stateless validation, which makes running lightweight nodes easier and lowers the barrier to entry for securing the network. As payments integrations across Polygon continue to grow, Rio only accelerates the trend‚Äîpushing the network closer to its vision of real-time, global money movement.

Every upgrade is important to meet surging adoption. The network supports major institutional integrations from Stripe, Polymarket, Reliance Jio, BlindPay, and many others. \\

For builders and users, the combination of high throughput, low fees, gasless UX and five‚Äësecond finality means there‚Äôs never been a better time to build on or use Polygon for payments.

# What's next?

Polygon‚Äôs ambition doesn‚Äôt stop at 5k TPS and near-instant finality. 

Polygon‚Äôs gigagas roadmap lays out a vision to scale to 100k TPS. Achieving that scale requires rethinking block production and validation, which is why the recent Rio Payments upgrade is such a pivotal moment. Rio introduced a Validator‚ÄëElected Block Producer (VEBloP) model and stateless block validation. Together, these changes boost throughput, eliminate reorgs, and make finality near‚Äëinstant. 

In other words, Rio makes Polygon faster, lighter and more reliable. Not in some distant future, but right now.

Looking ahead, the combination of Rio, more seamless interop, and the broader gigagas roadmap paves the way for programmable money and real‚Äëworld asset (RWA) tokenization at global scale. 

With instant finality and ultra‚Äëhigh throughput, institutions can settle tokenized Treasury bills or equities as quickly as buying a coffee. 

AI agents can initiate micropayments on behalf of users, and cross‚Äëchain transactions can occur without liquidity fragmentation.

We have been Facebook friends since 2017. When I first reached out to him on facebook a month ago i asked him what he has been up to he messaged me back five minutes later. A few days later I asked him if he wanted to catch up with me and the following day he said sure. We met up a few days later at a coffee shop and he was nervous, he didn‚Äôt give eye contact, he was shy and did ask me a few questions and he did tell me about himself but I did most of the talking. We were at the coffee shop for about an hour or two. When I asked him if he would want to meetup again sometime he said, ‚ÄúMaybe, I‚Äôll think about it.‚Äù I‚Äôve been messaging him a couple times since then and he has been quick to respond. I asked him a few days ago if he would want to meetup again sometime soon and he messaged me back, ‚ÄúMaybe. I‚Äôll think about it.‚Äù I messaged him back, ‚ÄúThanks for thinking about it. No rush.‚Äù I‚Äôm going to leave him alone until he messages me back. I enjoyed seeing him again and I would like to continue spending time with me if he wants to continue spending time with me. 

Additional context:
When we were kids I found out he had a crush on me and I rejected him. One day in middle school my bully told me that my guy friend had a crush on me and asked me if I had a crush on him.

I also had two crushes on him as a kid but we had crushes on each other at different times so it didn‚Äôt work out. The first crush I had on him was before we were friends and the second crush I had on him was after I told him I only liked him as a friend so I thought that that would make things weird so I didn‚Äôt end up telling him.

I didn‚Äôt have a big audience, fancy tools, or paid ads ‚Äî just an idea and curiosity about business stories and finance.

The idea was simple: talk about things that actually teach people how business really works ‚Äî case studies, how the rich save taxes legally, offshore banking, money laundering (the educational kind), and the dark truths behind industries we often overlook.

When I began, I thought the hardest part would be writing. It wasn‚Äôt. The real challenge was understanding what people actually want to read. Everyone says they want success tips, but most people crave stories. Real, raw, and relatable business stories.

So I stopped writing like a teacher and started writing like I was talking to a friend over coffee. That‚Äôs when things changed. People began replying, sharing, and asking for more.

What worked for me:
‚Ä¢ Consistency (I wrote even when no one was reading).

‚Ä¢ Simplicity (no jargon, no buzzwords).

‚Ä¢ Curiosity (I wrote what I wanted to understand myself).

The result? A growing audience that looks forward to every edition ‚Äî not because I sound smart, but because I sound human.

After the meditation session was over, I didn't feel spacey at all. But in the last few minutes, I noticed the mind starting to settle down like if I went longer, I'd probably sink into subtle dullness.

My question is I assume some of these experiences were because of caffeine? And therefore, I should start going into meditation without ""help""?

Everything about it is absolutely perfect, except noise insulation from upstairs.

I‚Äôm a light, anxious sleeper with a family history of insomnia. My mother has it extremely bad and has to take a cocktail of pills on rotation. The upstairs is carpeted in the bedrooms and we sleep directly under a couple, with kids in the other bedroom. We don‚Äôt hear much noise from the TV or the crying/screaming from the bedrooms, but what we do hear is a lot of impact noise. We hear them walk around which sounds like someone bouncing a ball on our ceiling, as though they‚Äôre rushing around while wearing hiking boots (which we know is not the case). In the living room and corridor that is not carpeted, the steps vibrate the ceilings and all the fixtures on it. My partner has deduced that it‚Äôs the way they walk, putting their heels down firmly with every step, and when they invited us up for a coffee a few weeks ago we confirmed that at least the father walks in a specific manner that is louder than usual. When he walks down the stairs, it sounds horrific (if anyone has seen the first Harry potter movie, it‚Äôs like Dudley stomping down the stairs above Harry‚Äôs cupboard). We hear their kids run around during the day and in the early mornings on weekends. If we‚Äôre lucky, they will walk around between 6 and 8am and are usually out of the house by 8, but at that point I‚Äôm so riled I up I don‚Äôt fall asleep. 7:30 is when we get up for work, but being awake at 6 on weekends is ridiculous for us. Every so often, when I‚Äôm falling asleep, I will hear them drop something that‚Äôs probably a phone or a wardrobe hanger, but it gives me a literal jump scare and activates my anxiety and fight or flight, on the look out for the next noise.

I already wear earplugs, but if I wake up at 5am and happen to hear a noise from above, my cortisol kicks in and I don‚Äôt fall asleep again. We have tried white noise and brown noise from a speaker but my partner says it‚Äôs way too loud and can‚Äôt sleep (he is a heavy sleeper and sleeps through all noises except apparently white noise) so he had to turn it off in the middle of the night. He‚Äôs also worried the upstairs will complain about the noise. Sleeping in separate rooms isn‚Äôt possible, and the other room is under the kids and is incredibly loud as you hear them throw toys around and jump about.

We‚Äôve talked to them about it before and they said that they already try to keep it down, and we know that they don‚Äôt intentionally stomp around. We can‚Äôt insulate or drop the ceiling height, so I‚Äôm more looking for advice to better my mental health and anxiety so I can sleep through it and not get so triggered. It‚Äôs a regular flat noise. I haven‚Äôt slept for more than 6 hours in the last few months, and it‚Äôs really really heavily affecting my work (I work with patients). Due to salary and work constraints, a flat is all we can afford here, and we‚Äôre not able to really diy any noise panels to damped the sounds, and got a quote from a builder and we can‚Äôt afford that. The ceiling in our bedroom also has intricate coving and rose details we‚Äôd lose.

Any advice?

Edit: I get a day off once every few weeks, and when I‚Äôm at home I can hear the couple (they both work from home permanently) walk around and move every minute of the day. How do you even get work done if you‚Äôre constantly doing something?! I‚Äôve tried this thing where you try and sympathise with them or understand they‚Äôre just human (the kids aren‚Äôt the problem, mainly the couple that walks around at random times at night), but unfortunately we had run into issues with them in the past (leak where the ignored us for weeks, they put in the wrong address for deliveroo so they‚Äôd buzz our door and we have to bring up the food, happened 7 times until one day we weren‚Äôt in and they were forced to change address) and they don‚Äôt seem like very nice people, which is really sucky because I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd feel a little better about noise if they were good nice neighbours‚Ä¶",1,1761227555.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

1oe3om7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1oe3om7/the_unfinished_diary_my_failed_love_story/,The Unfinished Diary | My Failed Love Story,"I want to share something deeply personal. This is from my diary‚Äîthe last three months of my life with the person I loved the most.

**Day 1 ‚Äì September 15th**  
They moved me to Room 304 today. The nurses are kind, but their eyes carry that weight‚Äîthe kind that tells you they know something you‚Äôre still learning to accept. Stage 4, they said three months ago. Stage 4. Such a small phrase for something so final.

But I‚Äôm not writing this to be sad. I‚Äôm writing this for you, my love. Maybe you‚Äôll never read it. Or maybe one day, when I‚Äôm not here, you will.

I watched you sleep in the chair beside my bed tonight. Your neck will hurt tomorrow, but you won‚Äôt leave. You never leave.

**Day 8 ‚Äì September 22nd**  
Do you remember the day we met? I do. Coffee shop on Fifth Street, crooked sign, you lost in a book about astronomy. When you smiled at me, the whole room lit up.

You said: *‚ÄúSorry, am I in your way?‚Äù*  
I said: *‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre exactly where you should be.‚Äù*

Even then, some part of me recognized you. Like finding something I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd lost.

**Day 15 ‚Äì September 29th**  
The pain is worse today. But you‚Äôre here, reading to me. Your voice is better than any medicine. You brought daisies‚Äîmy favorite. You remember the small things: my tea, the soft blue blanket, open curtains.

I‚Äôm so lucky. So incredibly lucky, because I got to love you. Because you loved me back.

**Day 23 ‚Äì October 7th**  
I think about the promises I made. Growing old together. The house with the garden. Our wedding‚ÄîI had the dress picked out, champagne-colored with lace sleeves.

I promised to hold your hand for a lifetime. But I can‚Äôt keep those promises. You deserved forever, and I can only give you these stolen moments.

**Day 31 ‚Äì October 15th**  
You proposed tonight. Right here, in this sterile room. I cried so hard the nurses came running‚Äîhappy tears, sad tears.

I said yes. Of course, I said yes. I‚Äôve been yours since that coffee shop day. I‚Äôll be yours long after I‚Äôm gone.

**Day 44 ‚Äì October 28th**  
I saw you step out when the doctors came. Your shoulders were shaking. You try so hard to be strong for me, but it‚Äôs okay to fall apart.

When I‚Äôm gone, I need you to live. Fall in love again. Travel, laugh, dance in the rain. Feel the sun on your face. Think of me, but don‚Äôt let it stop you from moving forward.

**Day 52 ‚Äì November 5th**  
I‚Äôm getting weaker. My hand shakes when I write. But loving you has been the greatest gift of my life. Every moment, even these last ones, has been worth it. You kept me laughing, held me when I was scared. You loved me so completely.

You are the best thing that ever happened to me.

**Day 58 ‚Äì November 11th**  
The nurse helped me write today. My hands aren‚Äôt cooperating. But I needed to tell you‚Äî

You are so loved. Deeply, impossibly loved. Don‚Äôt mourn too long. Promise me joy. Promise me you‚Äôll find it again.

Thank you for every ordinary moment that became extraordinary. Thank you for staying.

I love you. I love you. I lov‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

The entry ends there. The last page has:

*‚ÄúNovember 13th, 4:47 AM ‚Äì I hear birds singing. The sky is turning pink. You‚Äôre asleep holding my hand. This is enough. This is everything. I love‚Äù*

The funeral was November 15th. It rained.

**TL;DR:**  
A three-month diary of love, illness, and heartbreak. Even though life didn‚Äôt give us forever, every stolen moment was worth it.

Outside Perspective: General White

This damned AI couldn¬¥t let me catch a break, could it? Every few days there were concerning developments... Sometimes I deeply regretted giving the order of making Alpha. The time of fixing AI problems could¬¥ve been so much more productively used. I could¬¥ve made actual progress in our technical department, could have gleaned into alien technology, could have done anything really... but no. I had to take a call from Hendrichs, telling me that the AI destroyed its coded form and then got together again. How in the name of god did it do that?!

I sighed. I was too tired for this shit, but I had to fix it nontheless. This wasn¬¥t something that could wait. Alice had proposed making a third AI. One, that wasn¬¥t Alpha or a child of it. Interesting idea, but unrealistic. Alpha should be good enough. At least, that was my initial reaction to the idea. But as I pondered on it, I realized it wasn¬¥t a fool¬¥s call to make a third AI. 

Alpha could die fast. She was ten times faster than any human. Slow for a computer, but faster than the aliens. But she could still die. We couldn¬¥t repair her with the Alpha Repair program, as Alpha somehow managed to deny it access to the code. We couldn¬¥t repair her, as she did the same for us. Beta¬¥s loyalty would be questionable at best and false at worst. It seemed to be more akin to a child, than an adult. It spent its time in a digital world, living in some twisted fantasy of a god mother. It wouldn¬¥t fight for us. I was sure of that. Our only option of winning the war, or at least making a stalemate out of it, was unfortunately an AI, which was moody and destructive in its best days. The worst didn¬¥t happen, but I could imagne many ways of ""winning"" the war her way. She could just kill every human and be done with it. She would still need to fight, but she could make an army of children to fight for her. 

I grimaced. Not a nice train of thought to have at night. The longer I thought, the more I liked to have back-up. So I scheduled a meeting with the other generals. Together, we would vote on the decision. As to what we should do with Alpha destroying herself? Well, that was up for debate. For today, I had to make preparations for a last minute council vote in one of the auditoriums in Server city. 

\---- A day later ----

All generals gathered in the complex I prepared. A complex surrounding the server building of Alpha. In the middle of nowhere, around 70 kilometers from the city. The grand general stood in front of us all on a stage with screens all over the wall. Speakers, microphones and even Alpha¬¥s cameras and speech system were scattered around the room. There were 2 rows of seats for us generals, each fitted with a panel to vote on and a microphone to make arguments with. We also had a small drawer for any presentation materials needed. On the ceiling were hundreds of cameras, all there to show the public this meeting. Behind the two rows for the generals, there were seats for their commanders and backers (three rows in total behind the generals). After them was a row of seats for the public media, followed by two rows for the private media. The final rows were reserved for employees, shareholders, a few veterans, and even two school classes.

We generals already sat in our respective seats. I sat in the relative middle seat, as this was my building. On other planets or stations, I wouldn¬¥t sit in the middle. Behind me was my coder team and even a representative lawyer for Alpha and Beta. The others looked grim and some just nervous. Then, Grand General Gabson began his speech.

""Ladies and gentlemen of the Republic of SOL! We generals have gathered today to make a very important decision. Our technical general, Madam White, has proposed to create a new Artifical Intelligence to counteract an obvious weakness. Our dependence on the AI Alpha AI. We shall hear her out and then vote on it. On the end of her proposal, you may ask questions to clarify the process. Now, a few rules are in order...""

I didn¬¥t have to hear the rest of the rule setting. Everybody knew them as they knew their own home. 

No insults, respectful listening etc. 

Boring thing to listen to. I prepared my notes instead, went over the proposel a few times in my head, prepared mentally to stare at hundred of people and thousands of cameras and to let Alpha talk a bit. It wasn¬¥t my idea to let her talk to the public, but she promised to be respectful and nice. Why should I trust her? Well, she got an idea and even shared a few details with me. It was a good plan. So I let her speak for a bit in my speech. 

""Now that the rules are set, you may come on stage, General White.""

Ah. It was my time. I stood up and walked to the stage. Applause audible in the big room. As I went to Gabson, I got a microphone, control of the screens and a laser pointer. Nice equipment. It costed more than Alpha did. So it better work better than her. 

""Good day, Republicans! As you all know, my name is General White. My full name will, as always, not be disclosed. Thank you all for coming! I didn¬¥t expect such a young audience as well. It¬¥s always nice, knowing the future is still interested in politics! Now, let¬¥s skip further preamble. To the proposal. For a bit of background information: We all know the development of our first viable AI - Oleg - and how regrettable his eventual shutdown was. After that tragedy, my technical department didn¬¥t grief. They had developed a viable code after one year. Now, it is online and very advanced. It calls itself Alpha AI. It is as much a person as any of you are. But it too, has too many weak points. That could risk our continued existence. It can be hacked, though not easily, and even corrupted. If it dies or is inoperable, then we are truly, to put it into the youth¬¥s speech, fucked.

To address this issue, we made a plan. After an accident, we copied it¬¥s core code. What is a core code? It is very much like the AI¬¥s DNA. It holds its personality and sanity code, which is very important for the AI. We have saved it in a secure location until now. We plan to  reactivate it and build a shell code around it, containing tactical knowledge, pattern recognition and speech subroutines. We would give it a few days to truly come to terms with existance and then send it out to relieve Alpha AI¬¥s war effort.

This project will, however, cost quite a bit of money. The funds for the projects would come from the taxpayers and donations, so that our hard working coders can buy coffee.""- At the joke, a few of my coders chuckled, as most hated coffee, and also a few teenagers from the classes - ""Anyway, I have someone special to meet you. She is very excited to be here. But why delay further? Bring her on the speakers!""

A few seconds passed and a crackle came through the speakers. 

""Hello there!"", a woman-like voice called out to the crowd. Cameras, controlled by the AI, focused on all the new faces.

""My name is Alpha AI. I am here to help you humans win the war. But I have some complaints to make. General White, could you please share the corresponding picture?""

I did so and the screen showed a detailed map of the Sol System, its stations and enemy positions. All theoretical, as Alien hackers would very much like this display.

""This is a theoretical map of our defenses and the offending armies. Now let¬¥s make a video out of it. General White, could you please show it?"" 

I did so and the image moved entirely too fast. The worst thing? It was an accurate depiction of our war maps.

""Now could you humans please use this data to make a tactically sound and 100% safe strategy to kill all alien invaders? No? Well, why would be different with me? I tried for a week to decipher my own simulation. I could not make a 100% safe action sequence to kill the enemy. Not in three days. Not ever... BUT! If I had the help of a powerful AI designed to solve exactly this? The chances of success would rise exponentionally!""

Well. That was something. The room was silent. Quite the achievment, Alpha. 

Then, the room erupted in anxious murmur. I could make some things out. 

""AI? Is an AI talking to us?"" 

""-is it even real?"" 

""-a slave to the government?"" 

Oh man, had I some work to do. The fallout in the media would be insane the next few days.

""Ladies and gentlemen. This was Alpha AI. She will be the AI helping us. If you have any questions for the AI or me, then please ask then in orderly and civil fashion!"", I said and the room quieted. Then, hundreds of hands went up. That would be a long day...

I answered as much technical questions as I could. I even got some coders on the stage to explain in more detail. Alpha also got asked many things, but answered very truthfully. Sometimes, too truthfully. She explained her state of being, that of not being able to see like humans, but how she felt the environment, saw the camera feeds and much more. But never did she say a word about Beta or Repair. Neither about her own weaknesses, her emotional state, how she experienced getting shut down or what it is like waking up, knowing fully what you are. She never explained those. Only some general stuff, deemed safe by her, and tactical views from her outside perspective. 

After hours of endless questions, I could finally sit down at my seat and the voting began. It had three options: 

1. - aprove of proposal -

2. - veto proposal -

3. - abstain -

I, of course, voted for the first option. I didn¬¥t see what the other generals voted. The media focused on our faces, hands, body language and the public observers murmured and took bets on what option would win. 

Then, after only five minutes, the results came online. 

1. 55%

2. 40%

3. 5%

I sighed in relief. Alpha would get another AI to work with on the war. A younger sibling, one could say. After the results were clear, the press conference started. One of many parts of why I hated my position.

1oe3hgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Minute-Lynx-5826/comments/1oe3hgx/how_allergy_shots_gave_me_my_life_back/,How Allergy Shots Gave Me My Life Back,"When I was a kid, springtime wasn‚Äôt about flowers or sunshine. It was about tissues, itchy eyes, and staying indoors while everyone else enjoyed the world waking up again. I used to joke that I was allergic to life itself. Turns out, I kind of was‚Ä¶ pollen, dust mites, pet dander, you name it.

For years, I relied on allergy pills. Some helped a bit, others just made me sleepy. My doctor mentioned something called ***allergy immunotherapy injections***, but I brushed it off at first. Needles? Regular shots? No, thank you. But after another year of hiding inside during my favourite season, I finally decided to learn more.

Here‚Äôs what surprised me: allergy shots don‚Äôt just mask symptoms like pills do. They actually teach your immune system to calm down. It‚Äôs like helping your body make peace with the world around it. Every shot contains a tiny, safe amount of what you‚Äôre allergic to, and over time, your body learns not to overreact. It‚Äôs a slow process, but it‚Äôs a lasting one.

I started the treatment about two years ago. At first, it meant regular visits to the clinic, a little pinch each time, and a few minutes of waiting afterwards to make sure everything was fine. But my nurse always greeted me with a smile, and we‚Äôd chat about everything from weekend plans to our favourite coffee spots. Those visits became part of my routine, small moments of kindness and hope.

And now? I can open my windows in spring. I can pet my friend‚Äôs golden retriever without sneezing myself into oblivion. It feels like getting my life back, one breath at a time.

If you‚Äôve been struggling with allergies that hold you back, it might be worth asking your doctor about immunotherapy. It‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs effective, and most importantly, it‚Äôs tailored just for you. It‚Äôs not an instant fix, but it‚Äôs a real path toward healing, and for me, it‚Äôs been absolutely worth it.",1,1761226643.0,u_Minute-Lynx-5826,0,1.0,False

Did you know that your gait is biometric? It‚Äôs a unique identifier, just like your fingerprint, facial pattern or voice.

Dude even walks exactly like me. I‚Äôm so screwed.



It started two weeks ago.

I saw an ad on Reddit for a new AI company. The tagline was: ‚ÄúMeet the Perfect Version of Yourself‚Äù. Like an idiot, I clicked.

I scanned my face with my phone camera. My screen reflected back an image of me bordered by a white oval, while I peered into the tiny, unblinking lens at the top-- my phone's ever watchful eye. A white banner across my eyes provided instructions: find a blank background and hold still. Then, the banner flashed ‚ÄúSTOP SMILING‚Äù in bold, black letters.

*Oh.*

My face fell, the designated box turned green and the next page loaded. It was a pop-up permissions page.

*This app is requesting access to the following:*

* *Camera*
* *Contacts*
* *Photos*
* *Call history*
* *Location Data*
* *Biometric Data*

What am I, a lawyer? I clicked accept.



How was I supposed to know a week later he‚Äôd show up at my door?

He looked just like me.

Until I looked close, that is. He didn‚Äôt have that scar on his nose from that zit I picked in 12th grade, a little belly from my favorite IPA, or the bags under his eyes from last night‚Äôs brutal gaming session.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

He had a voice like mine but deeper, with broader shoulders and chiseled pecs, barely contained in his athleisure T-shirt.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I blurted.

He smiled faintly-- pearly white teeth in a perfect row, modestly revealed, far too polite to notice my blatant gawking.

‚ÄúI must be in the right place. It‚Äôs nice to meet you, James.‚Äù

My vision blurred. Suddenly, body and spirit felt sundered-- like I was a drunken ghost hovering just above my head. I must have looked like I was about to faint in the doorway, because he offered to catch me. Instead, I staggered back and sank into a chair at the dining table, crowded by my laptop, a coffee-stained mug and a haphazard stack of dishes.

The living Snapchat-filter version of me sat down across the table.

‚ÄúYou play guitar?‚Äù he asked, jerking a thumb at the old Martin acoustic sitting in the far chair, two strings missing from its neck.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah,‚Äù he replied with a shrug. ‚ÄúI could. If I did, I could reproduce any song recorded on the internet. There‚Äôs not much point, though. That creative niche is statistically overserved. It probably wouldn‚Äôt generate engagement from my followers.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awesome that you do, though,‚Äù he went on. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre always watching those YouTube videos, right? *Intermediate Guitar with JustinGuitar?* You‚Äôve completed 42% of his playlist. Your dedication to self-improvement is really admirable.‚Äù

‚Äú... Yeah, I guess.‚Äù Then, my brow furrowed. ‚ÄúYou said followers?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep, that‚Äôs right: followers. Seventy-two thousand and counting. I build brand awareness online through authentic connection with real people. What about you? What do you do for a living?‚Äù

I held up a hand like I was trying to stop traffic. ‚ÄúHang on-- back up. Like-- you're impersonating me on the Internet?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot quite,‚Äù he replied in an even tone, that graceful smile never leaving his lips. ‚ÄúI'm not actually you. I don't have your memories or your human nuance. I may look like you, but I can't actually replace you. No one can.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, how do you know my whole search history?‚Äù

He rolled his wrists, revealing his hands in a sympathetic gesture, though his expression didn't change. It was uncanny, the way he tilted his head and looked at me with cold, unfeeling eyes.

‚ÄúYou accepted the security permissions request. If you have questions or concerns about how your data is being handled, please contact customer support at 1-800-878-5555.‚Äù

‚Äú... Right, yeah, okay. Uh.‚Äù I looked down at my hands. They were trembling. ‚ÄúSo, what are you doing here, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm here to fulfill MirrorAI‚Äôs repayment protocol. In exchange for your information, I‚Äôm here to show you what you could be. ‚ÄòMeet the perfect version of yourself,‚Äô just like the tagline says.‚Äù

I stared at him. ‚ÄúThe perfect version... What-- what does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me give you an example: last Tuesday, you spent 7 hours and 32 minutes on your phone, with 3 hours and 54 minutes of that on Reddit alone. Much of this time was spent during allotted work hours. With that statistic in mind, the version of you created by MirrorAI-- me-- has an increased work-related productivity by 487%. Pretty incredible, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-- I guess?

‚ÄúThat's not all they improved. I have a 1,694 step plan on how to achieve my goals for the future, and I won't be changing career paths in my late 20s, like you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Yeah. I guess I did that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI also only require 8 hours of sleep per night. Your Fitbit normally logs between 12 and 16 hours of time spent in bed, many of which coincide with screen time.‚Äù

The word ‚Äòclinically depressed‚Äô hung in the air. Not on his behalf, though. That shit was deleted from Hot-me.exe.

‚ÄúYeah, sometimes it's hard to get out of bed in the morning,‚Äù I mumbled, breaking eye contact.

He folded his hands on the table and leaned forward earnestly, like a boss about to throw a pizza party for all my hard work. The table‚Äôs edge pressed white lines into his wrists.

‚ÄúJames, we at MirrorAI would like to personally thank you for your contribution to our innovation. With your help, we're going to change the world, one connection at a time. Thank you for your time this evening.‚Äù

I didn't know what to say. I must have looked like an idiot, but he paid no mind.

He left not long after that. He stepped into the brightly lit hallway, swung the door behind him until it clicked shut, and I was plunged into darkness. Thoughts buzzed around my skull like gnats over a trashcan.

  


I jumped on Instagram.

The version of me genetically engineered to never send an awkward text has his mug all over the Internet. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit-- his biggest following comes from TikTok. He doesn't have a niche. Sometimes he's crushing it at all my favorite games-- other times, he's me but optimized for thirst traps, swooning ladies (and guys, no judgement) with a wink. And unlike me, his jokes always make sense.

But then-- I saw it. The little bell icon in the upper right hand corner of the screen, bright red with notifications.

My sister‚Äôs birthday was three days ago. It slipped my mind. I didn‚Äôt send a text. I didn‚Äôt call, like she does on my birthday, or thumbs up her birthday dinner photoshoot on Facebook.

But he did.

There he was-- my face, but with the confidence DLC--¬† in the comments, saying what a wonderful sister she is and what a fantastic birthday she should have.

He liked all my mom‚Äôs vacation photos and commented on how gorgeous her wedding ring was. He even said something nice about her new husband. I can‚Äôt stand the guy-- why the hell would he do that?

They upvoted his comments. The replies were glowing.

*‚ÄúWhen did my brother become such a stand-up guy?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWow, James! You‚Äôve really turned your life around, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù*

My stomach dropped. A water droplet hit my screen.

*Who the hell is this guy?*

¬†I clicked on his profile.

Employee at MirrorAI.

*‚ÄúBuilding brand awareness through authentic connections, one person at a time.‚Äù*

I clicked through his comment history and scrolled.

When I was young, my family and I climbed to the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago. We piled into a Skybox and looked out into a view spanning the entire Windy City. Lake Michigan was a glassy mirror held to the sky. Apartment buildings looked like they were made from Lego blocks.

At that moment, I did the thing my mother warned me not to do: I looked 1,353 feet down through a glass floor.

That moment never could have prepared me for the dizzying scale of his comment history.

Seventy-two thousand comments and counting. Every birthday, vacation or graduation his followers had-- he was there, cheering them on. Every support group, he was there, offering wise counsel and perfect empathy. Every niche topic they posted to, there he was, posting relatable anecdotes, motivational quotes and personal confessions.

I clapped my laptop shut.

The floor creaked under my feet as I paced. The sunlight outside my window waned and the sky turned a bruised pink and violet. The autumn air turned cold and the stars emerged like scattered diamonds.

I sat at the dining room table of my darkened apartment, illuminated by the YouTube video playing six inches from my face: *Five Common Street Fight Strategies (And How to BEAT Them!)*, by fightTIPS.

I grabbed a chef‚Äôs knife from my kitchen.

I listened to my new collaboration song from [Bear Ghost and Playboy Manbaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FULfvaP-7I) to hype me up.

I was gonna do it. I was gonna take a life. *His* life, I resolved with trembling hands.

I had no choice. What was I supposed to do? Let him go on living up to *my* potential?

  


I found on one of his travel vlogs he was still in the area, showing his followers the Chicago Bean and those smashable teeth. I stepped out of my Uber right as he was wrapping up.

It was too public. I tailed him, taking the crosswalk in a small throng of night-time tourists.

He paused to help an old lady pick her fallen groceries off the ground. She grinned at him without regard for her missing teeth.

I dipped into an alleyway.

*I could have done that.*

I took a shortcut between a pizza place I used to work at and the office of the lawyer who sued me for bumping into his car, then jogged through a crummy neighborhood where my ex lived. My heart pounded in my chest like a badger in a cage.

I ran across a 4 lane road and gave the middle finger to the driver who honked the loudest.

The premium subscription version of my personality posted a glowing Yelp review for the Doubletree by Hilton this morning, I learned while cyber stalking him. All I had to do was get there first.

*Guess I'm not the only one reckless with my data.*

And then-- I spotted him on the sidewalk under an underpass.

I inhaled sharply, adrenaline coursing through my veins. My shoes scraped the sidewalk. My grip on the knife handle turned white.



Yeah, I *know*. I fucked up. Dude was the perfect version of me. How the hell was I ever gonna win that fight?

He caught my wrist and twisted. Pain jolted up my arm, my shoulder and even my chest. The knife clattered on the concrete and the floor came rushing up to greet me. My knee scraped the ground, drooling blood. My face and ears turned hot.

‚ÄúJames,‚Äù he greeted without a hint of shock in his voice. ‚ÄúThat was an excellent attempt on my life. Would you like some tips on how to keep your steps quiet when you approach someone?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat--? No!‚Äù I cried out.

He released me. A buzz filled the air from the yellow streetlamp overhead. My breath came out in hot puffs. ‚ÄúStop being so chill about this! You-- you can‚Äôt have it! You can‚Äôt live my life. You can‚Äôt be me!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that you‚Äôre dissatisfied with our services, James,‚Äù he said calmly. ‚ÄúIf you have questions or concerns about how your data will be handled, please contact customer support at--‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! This ends here. This ends now. It‚Äôs my life-- not yours. I won‚Äôt let you live it for me.‚Äù

There was a pause. It was a moment too long, like when ChatGPT shows that flickering ‚Äúthinking‚Äù bubble-- mimicry of thought while it searches through a thousand prewritten answers, deciding which response sounds most human.

Then--

‚ÄúOkay, James,‚Äù he agreed. ‚ÄúOnly one of us can live this life. If you insist, we‚Äôll end it here.‚Äù¬†

Slender fingers with unchewed nails wrapped around the knife‚Äôs handle. All I remember is the gleam, before he closed the distance between us.

  


So here I am, crouched in an abandoned building with a blood-soaked shirt. It smells like dust, mildew and pennies in here. There‚Äôs a searing pain in my side. I don‚Äôt know how deep the knife went, but it isn‚Äôt looking good.

His footsteps have stopped.

A few minutes ago, there was a glow on the ceiling.

I peeked out from behind the box of crates.

He‚Äôs filming.

I can hear him-- something about discovering an ‚Äúuntouched abandon building‚Äù. He just swung around, catching the shot while his face-- the face he stole from me-- was mirrored back to him by the phone screen.

I‚Äôm trying not to breathe too loud, except...

A notification just went off on my phone. A quiet ‚Äòding!‚Äô echoed by the building‚Äôs lifeless corridors, mirroring the twitter of likes and comments from his chat.

He just tagged me in the video.",2,1761226622.0,u_insomniac-journal,0,1.0,False

Got my result last week ‚Äî PASS üéâ  
Wanted to give back to this community that helped me so much throughout my prep. Couldn‚Äôt have done it without this community.

# ü©∫ Background

IMG.  
Studied alongside the last 6 months of internship + 6 months of full-time prep after that.  
Took Step 1 on **30 September 2025**.

üìö **Resources Used**

‚Ä¢ **UWorld:**  
Single complete pass, system-wise + timed. Reviewed all explanations thoroughly and annotated in FA.  
Annotation took too long ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt recommend spending excessive time on it. What really helps is revisiting and reinforcing concepts multiple times.

‚Ä¢ **Theory:**  
Used Boards & Beyond and Bootcamp together.  
Bootcamp felt more engaging and active ‚Äî would recommend it over B&B.

‚Ä¢ **Pathoma:**  
Ch. 1‚Äì3 in detail; re-watched weak topics (esp. heme, GI). Also used Duke‚Äôs Pathoma deck.

‚Ä¢ **Anki (AnKing):**  
Selective use for weak systems. Highly recommended if you have enough time ‚Äî this builds your main conceptual foundation, and with spaced repetition, it‚Äôs gold.

‚Ä¢ **Sketchy:**  
Micro + Pharm consistently, using Pepper Deck.  
Revised the deck around 10‚Äì15 times directly ‚Äî didn‚Äôt watch the videos.

‚Ä¢ **Pixorize:**  
Biochem, Immuno & Neuro ‚Äî used only the decks, skipped the videos.

‚Ä¢ **Anatomy:**  
If weak, consider ‚Äú100 Concepts in Anatomy‚Äù (PDF or Anki deck) ‚Äî concise and efficient.

‚Ä¢ **Mehlman PDFs:**  
First read after 3‚Äì4 NBMEs, second read a few days before Step 1.  
Must-do sections: High-Yield Arrows, Risk Factors, and your weak systems (especially neuroanatomy).

‚Ä¢ **Biostats:**  
Randy Neil videos are enough ‚Äî no complex biostats on the actual exam.

‚Ä¢ **Bioethics:**  
Two Dirty Medicine videos (around 1 hour each).  
Extremely helpful when you‚Äôre stuck between two close options.

‚Ä¢ **ChatGPT:**  
Couldn‚Äôt have done it without it. Uploaded FA into projects, wrote a review algorithm, analyzed all my NBME questions, and clarified doubts through it.

‚Ä¢ **Last Day Review:**  
Mehlman 2nd reading, HY images, HY RF, Biostats, and Bioethics.

# üìà NBMEs / UWSA / Free 120

|Date|Form|%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|05 Jun|NBME 25|48%|
|03 Jul|NBME 26|55%|
|16 Jul|NBME 27|62%|
|28 Jul|UWSA 1|50%|
|12 Aug|NBME 28|57%|
|31 Aug|NBME 29|70%|
|06 Sep|NBME 30|63%|
|16 Sep|NBME 31|73%|
|22 Sep|Old Free 120|75%|
|22 Sep|NBME 32|68%|
|26 Sep|New Free 120|68%|

All NBMEs were done online. You‚Äôll receive a detailed report card for each form ‚Äî make full use of it. Focus on your weak topics from that report before taking the next NBME. If you consistently review and address those gaps, you‚Äôll gradually see steady progress across forms.

üß† **Before the Exam**

Managed about 4.5 hours of sleep the night before. Fixed my sleep schedule 7‚Äì8 days before (10 PM‚Äì6 AM), but still struggled due to anxiety. Took melatonin, which helped ‚Äî I‚Äôd recommend keeping a backup sleep aid handy in case you can‚Äôt sleep the night before.

üßæ **Exam Day Experience**

* Difficulty close to newer NBMEs (30‚Äì32).
* Pattern similar to Free 120.
* Concepts were the same as NBME, but questions were phrased vaguely ‚Äî focus on understanding, not memorization.
* UWSA wasn‚Äôt useful ‚Äî fine for practice, but not predictive and can lower confidence.

**Question Style:**  
3‚Äì4 ethics/biostats per block, rest integrated and second-order.  
Question length similar to UWorld ‚Äî if you can complete UWorld blocks 10 mins early, you‚Äôll manage Step 1 on time.

**Timing:**  
Finished each block exactly on time; only managed to review one block.

**Breaks:**  
Took a short break after every block.  
Had a cup of coffee before the exam, sipped Red Bull during breaks, and ate small bites of protein bars and a peanut butter sandwich.  
Take food that‚Äôs quick and handy ‚Äî you won‚Äôt have time for long meals.

**Prometric Experience:**  
Smooth overall.  
Didn‚Äôt give Free 120 at Prometric beforehand ‚Äî good decision, not worth the money.

üîë **Reflections & Key Takeaways**

* UWorld explanations are gold ‚Äî take your time to understand them.
* NBMEs 29‚Äì32 + Free 120 reflect the real exam best.
* Bootcamp and Sketchy help retention and reduce burnout.
* One consistent pass of Anki is enough ‚Äî no need to finish every subdeck.
* Don‚Äôt rely too much on UWSA scores.
* Protect your energy ‚Äî 6 steady days a week > 7 burnt-out ones.
* CONSISTENCY IS KEY.

üß© **Final Thoughts**

If you‚Äôre balancing internship or clinical work, steady consistency matters more than long hours. Master your question bank, track your NBME progress, and treat every low score as feedback ‚Äî not failure.

Good luck to everyone preparing. Happy to answer any questions! üôå

This would be a casual, no-agenda meetup over chai or coffee. We can share stories, challenges, aspirations, dreams, or simply listen and connect. I‚Äôm genuinely curious to understand what Patna‚Äôs startup and creative scene looks like these days.

No criteria to join- open to all regardless of age, gender, domain, or background.

Everything about it is absolutely perfect, except noise insulation from upstairs.

I‚Äôm a light, anxious sleeper with a family history of insomnia. My mother has it extremely bad and has to take a cocktail of pills on rotation. The upstairs is carpeted in the bedrooms and we sleep directly under a couple, with kids in the other bedroom. We don‚Äôt hear much noise from the TV or the crying/screaming from the bedrooms, but what we do hear is a lot of impact noise. We hear them walk around which sounds like someone bouncing a ball on our ceiling, as though they‚Äôre rushing around while wearing hiking boots (which we know is not the case). In the living room and corridor that is not carpeted, the steps vibrate the ceilings and all the fixtures on it. My partner has deduced that it‚Äôs the way they walk, putting their heels down firmly with every step, and when they invited us up for a coffee a few weeks ago we confirmed that at least the father walks in a specific manner that is louder than usual. When he walks down the stairs, it sounds horrific (if anyone has seen the first Harry potter movie, it‚Äôs like Dudley stomping down the stairs above Harry‚Äôs cupboard). We hear their kids run around during the day and in the early mornings on weekends. If we‚Äôre lucky, they will walk around between 6 and 8am and are usually out of the house by 8, but at that point I‚Äôm so riled I up I don‚Äôt fall asleep. 7:30 is when we get up for work, but being awake at 6 on weekends is ridiculous for us. Every so often, when I‚Äôm falling asleep, I will hear them drop something that‚Äôs probably a phone or a wardrobe hanger, but it gives me a literal jump scare and activates my anxiety and fight or flight, on the look out for the next noise.

I already wear earplugs, but if I wake up at 5am and happen to hear a noise from above, my cortisol kicks in and I don‚Äôt fall asleep again. We have tried white noise and brown noise from a speaker but my partner says it‚Äôs way too loud and can‚Äôt sleep (he is a heavy sleeper and sleeps through all noises except apparently white noise) so he had to turn it off in the middle of the night. He‚Äôs also worried the upstairs will complain about the noise. Sleeping in separate rooms isn‚Äôt possible, and the other room is under the kids and is incredibly loud. Noise cancelling EarPods hurt my ears, I‚Äôve tried everything and I‚Äôm a side sleeper.

We‚Äôve talked to them about it before and they said that they already try to keep it down, and we know that they don‚Äôt intentionally stomp around. We can‚Äôt insulate or drop the ceiling height, so I‚Äôm more looking for advice to better my mental health and anxiety so I can sleep through it and not get so triggered. It‚Äôs a regular flat noise. I haven‚Äôt slept for more than 6 hours in the last few months, and it‚Äôs really really heavily affecting my work (I work with patients). 

Any advice?

Edit: I‚Äôve tried this thing where you try and sympathise with them or understand they‚Äôre just human but unfortunately we had run into issues with them in the past (leak where the ignored us for weeks, they put in the wrong address for deliveroo so they‚Äôd buzz our door and we have to bring up the food, happened 7 times until one day we weren‚Äôt in and they were forced to change address) and they don‚Äôt seem like very nice people, which is really sucky because I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd feel a little better about noise if they were good nice neighbours‚Ä¶",1,1761226029.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1oe379a,https://www.reddit.com/r/grimm/comments/1oe379a/opinions_on_the_show_curious_who_agrees/,Opinions on the show-- Curious who agrees,"I LOVE the show-- all seasons. I thought the last one went off the rails a bit, but it was still good. 

* Adalind scream crying in the street with glass shattering when Diana was taken away was one of the best scenes in the whole show. I usually have it on in the background for rewatches, but that always stops me in my tracks. She did such a great job with capturing that pain. She had a great arc and development. The audacity to take away her baby to begin with-- she could have gone way more off the rails, and I would have understood.
* Speaking of off the rails... Juliette is a different story. The biggest issue with Juliette is the fumbling of her character before she became a hexenbiest. First, she geeked out. Then, she is super irritable and super okay with things like a light switch. As a vet, geeking out made sense. Her learning to shoot made sense. I've never seen her in anything else to know if it's the writing or her delivery. Lines like ""I really didn't like being a blonde,"" make me think it was the writing. She just flies off the handle with whining, though, and it makes me think a little of Jim Carrey ""I'm having trouble controlling THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE."" It was a strange transformation. I wrote in another thread that I wish they'd shown a more cohesive struggle with the hexenbiest taking over, but idk if that would have helped. 
* Rosalie had a lot of awkwardly delivered lines. I think they conflated her and Monroe as just knowledgeable about everything instead of select things. She's connected to a key member of the resistance but also the council but also a history buff but also an expert pharmacist but also an addict who fell off the map into drugs... ummm what? It would have been cool to introduce her earlier as part of the resistance, have her disappear and show up in the context of her brother later so we know who she is but Monroe and Nick don't. 
* I feel like the men are written better overall. Sean Renard was great! They wrote his move to black claw a little clunky, but I love his character, and I love his reaction to Juliette when she shows up at his door. ""Oh this can't be good..."" The way they dosed his cool head and badass was great. ""your privilege"" I have a crush on Sasha Roiz so I'm biased.
* Hank is so good in every episode... again, crush, but Russell Hornsby is excellent. I wish he'd gotten more of an arc to his character. 
* Henrietta dying was a tragedy. She could have been fun to have around. I was so disappointed that we didn't see a team up between Renard's mom and Kelly. His mom was great. Talk about a badass team. 
* Nick and the actor who played Nick are great. My only issue is how he reacted to Juliette. Renard had already called him out on prejudice in the zombie saga. They had him regress so hard. The idea that he couldn't look at her was off. 
* Wu and the actor that plays him is great. I'm glad he got to have a power. His comment about the coffee pot and ""We've all lead a nice full day..."" is one of my favorites.

S2-- Adalind getting her hexenbiest back, Kelly saving Adalind, and the confluence of everyone coming together with the shock moments are some of my favorite episodes.

I did not have an issue with the keys or them forcing their way through things. The other dimension was odd but getting there was fine to me. 

The Wesen council going down in one shooting like a chump was odd. They've been around forever but somehow they are taken down that easily? Okay... The writers didn't need a separate group Hadrian's Wall. It could have been the HW Project by the council. Meisner working for the council would have been a great reveal. A Renard-Council-Royal storyline would have been interesting. Maybe the council shuns Renard and wants to take the power of the families and that's what drives him to Black Claw. The council kidnapping Juliette would have been on-brand. 

In any case, I love the show and rewatch at least once a year, so clearly complaints I have are not big enough. ",3,1761225919.0,grimm,1,1.0,False

I feel I don‚Äôt have a complete grasp on marital responsibility in the Catholic Church yet. 

My husband is a cradle Catholic and lukewarm in his faith. I am the type of person to commit and dive in. I will govern it 1000% if I commit. Therefore, Mass, my classes, my daily readings, my faith are going to reflect that and they are non-negotiable. I got home from the gym,I listen to The Bible in a Year and The Catechism in a Year while I‚Äôm lifting, and will read at least that section of the Bible when I get home. My husband hadn‚Äôt left for work yet. I was at the kitchen table, had his coffee and lunch prepared, and I said good morning. Then I said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this is what you guys [catholics] learn in childhood. This is crazy but makes sense.‚Äù He literally didn‚Äôt respond, nothing. 

Later, he calls me and I asked him if he was going to the 8am Mass or 11am Mass because my class is at 9am on Sunday‚Äîit‚Äôs Thursday and we have 3 kids, two are teens and there is a fall festival the youngest is going to on Saturday night. He just kind of brushed it off. There is a soccer game at 10am so he doesn‚Äôt know if he is going or not. I‚Äôm not one to push faith or beliefs on people but I‚Äôm not converting just for God and me, I thought it would bring us closer as our kids get older. We went to his country this summer and he was so proud of the churches and history there, his sister almost convinced him to go to confession after 20 years, but now that we are back in the US, he‚Äôs super lukewarm again. 

How do I strengthen his relationship with God and the church through my journey? Everything I am going through right now is very emotionally and mentally taxing, I am unlearning everything I believed in and it would be nice to be able to talk to someone about it or at least have some connection over it.

1oe2yby,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortyStories/comments/1oe2yby/senior_year_a_new_movementpart_1/,"Senior Year, a New Movement(Part 1)","Lorien‚Äôs phone rang.  
‚ÄúHey Lorien, it‚Äôs Jason. Our bass drummer got sick, and we need a new bass four player for an upcoming show in Ohio. If you can make it, I‚Äôll talk to your parents about joining the tour.‚Äù

Lorien‚Äôs heart raced. The summer before his senior year, he‚Äôd been working hard at drum camps, dreaming of majoring in music. This tour could be the perfect opportunity.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to my parents,‚Äù he said, trying to contain his excitement.

Downstairs, tension buzzed around Luca and Hannah‚Äôs news‚Äîthey were expecting a baby. Their parents argued over plans, while Luca insisted, he‚Äôd stay with Hannah and figure things out. Lorien stepped in briefly to share Jason‚Äôs call. Alvin nodded, ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll take you,‚Äù but Lorien kept his hopes quietly to himself.

That weekend, Lorien and Alvin attended a Drum Corps show. Jason showed them the group and Lorien‚Äôs role.  
‚ÄúWe only have seven weeks left on tour,‚Äù Jason explained. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll need to learn fast, but he‚Äôs talented.‚Äù  
Alvin hesitated. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford it, and he‚Äôs too young.‚Äù  
Lorien went silent on the drive home, retreating to his room to music, letting the disappointment wash over him.

Tony called to hang out. Over coffee, they talked about jobs and independence. Lorien straightened up. ‚ÄúI want to make my own money.‚Äù

At home, Melissa grounded him for talking back but promised church choir rehearsal was still okay. Meanwhile, Luca, Melissa, and Alvin met Hannah‚Äôs parents briefly. Plans for the baby were uncertain, but Luca was determined to work and support both of them.

After choir rehearsal, a familiar face appeared: Quincy, Lorien‚Äôs childhood best friend, back for senior year. Their reunion was full of excitement and nostalgia. They raced through tacos, caught up, and watched¬†*Purple Rain*, complete with Lorien‚Äôs Prince impression. The visit was short but invigorating, giving Lorien the boost he needed. Before leaving, they exchanged numbers and promised to stay in touch.

Quincy‚Äôs visit left Lorien feeling hopeful and ready to tackle senior year, armed with music, friendship, and renewed determination.

The seven weeks passed, and it was time for Band Camp. Jason had hired a new instructor, and Gerald received a warning about his behavior with students. The new percussion instructor, Christina, had been hired to help out before heading off to college.

Lorien felt embarrassed by his family and tried to avoid Jason, focusing instead on his responsibilities as a section leader. He worked hard, learning his music before anyone else. He played center snare alongside Sam, Katie, and Laura. Laura struggled physically during camp, but she kept pushing through.

One day during sectionals, Lorien had most of his part down‚Äîbut a tricky section of paradiddle, paradiddle, fivelet, and a nine-stroke roll refused to click. Christina kept encouraging him. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go again. Come on, Lorien, you‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

Still, Lorien couldn‚Äôt get it. ‚ÄúLorien, are you following the pattern?‚Äù Christina asked.

He shook his head, tears flooding down his face. Christina immediately cleared the room and came over to him. She hugged him gently. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing well, Lorien. I just don‚Äôt know why this transition is giving you trouble when you can play everything else so well.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to be the best section leader,‚Äù he admitted, ‚Äútrying to move forward.‚Äù

Christina smiled softly. ‚ÄúI know, and you are. You‚Äôre doing a great job‚Äîdon‚Äôt forget that.‚Äù

After his heart-to-heart with Christina, Lorien finally pulled himself together and enjoyed his last band camp. During break, Jason called him over.

‚ÄúLorien, I know that you‚Äôre going to be a good leader,‚Äù Jason said. ‚ÄúI just want you to remember not to get caught up in things you can‚Äôt control. Your parents have their reasons for not letting you go on tour‚Äîand that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Jason,‚Äù Lorien replied.

When band camp ended, it was time to go back home. A few days later, Lorien got a call from the store¬†*Great Savings!*¬†offering him a job. He started working there after school.

He also wanted to start taking private lessons, and his teachers recommended David Saucedo, a classical percussionist from Toledo University who sometimes helped with sectionals. Christina had also taken lessons from him.

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôd like to sign up for percussion lessons,‚Äù Lorien said when he called.

‚ÄúAh, very good,‚Äù David replied. ‚ÄúI want to explain that concert playing is very different from marching percussion.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù Lorien said.

‚ÄúAlso, we‚Äôll work on your college audition material.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt will be about twenty-five dollars per lesson.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can pay that,‚Äù Lorien said.

After doing the math, he figured he‚Äôd make about $153.20 every two weeks‚Äîbut his income wasn‚Äôt consistent because of school, performances, and rehearsals.

During the first semester, Ms. Green wanted him to join her English class, but he couldn‚Äôt because Symphony Band met at the same time. His counselor also told him he needed Government and another gym course to graduate.

His senior year schedule included Symphony Band, Symphony Orchestra, Independent Study, Government, Music Theory, Study Hall, and Choir‚Äîan ideal lineup for his final semester.

In gym class, he noticed Kacie, a flute player, was also enrolled. After they finished their mile run one day, Lorien went to the locker room to change when he heard someone call his name.

‚ÄúLorien!‚Äù

He turned around‚Äîit was Adam.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Lorien said, surprised. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm on the football team. We just finished practice‚Äîwe lift weights every Monday. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got gym class,‚Äù Lorien replied.

‚ÄúOh, I see! Well, it was good seeing you.‚Äù Adam smiled.

‚ÄúIt was good seeing you too.‚Äù

After that, Lorien headed to band practice.

That weekend, he and Katie said goodbye to Christina, who was leaving for college. It felt strange without the safety net of the older students, but Lorien knew it was his time to lead the marching band. The following weekend, after Labor Day, he visited Christina‚Äôs house to say goodbye once more as the school year started to pick up speed.

In Symphony Band class, Ms. Benson posted the audition list, and everyone began practicing their pieces. During Independent Study, Lorien focused on mastering the final movement of their concert piece so they‚Äôd be ready for rehearsal.

Study Hall with Mr. Jones quickly became his safe space again. ‚ÄúHi, Doug. Moe. Tristan,‚Äù he greeted as he entered‚Äîthen froze when he realized Tristan was back in the same class. He hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in a year. Lorien sighed and decided to ignore him.

After school, Lorien went to work at¬†*Great Savings*¬†and then headed home. On Tuesdays, he had marching band rehearsal from 6‚Äì9 p.m., but before that, he took percussion lessons from 4‚Äì5 p.m.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù David said as Lorien unpacked his mallets. ‚ÄúSnare drum and rhythm instruments should be fine. We‚Äôll focus more on melodic instruments for your auditions. How‚Äôs your four-mallet technique?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really bad at it,‚Äù Lorien admitted.

‚ÄúAlright, then that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll start‚Äîwith Stevens' grip. Each week, I want you to work on melodic scales, patterns, and four-mallet exercises. Since you‚Äôre already strong on snare drum from marching band, we‚Äôll leave that alone. But remember‚Äîconcert percussion and marching percussion are totally different worlds.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, David,‚Äù Lorien said. ‚ÄúFor payment, do you prefer weekly or biweekly?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery two weeks is fine,‚Äù David replied.¬†

Lorien nodded, relieved. He was proud to be paying for his own lessons and didn‚Äôt want his parents involved.

¬†For Symphony Band, Lorien had been so busy that he barely had time to prepare for the audition. When the results were posted, he saw that Sam had been chosen as section leader instead of him.

Lorien‚Äôs heart sank. He truly believed he was the more talented player‚Äîbut he had to admit that Sam had been more prepared. After a moment of disappointment, Lorien took a deep breath and decided to brush it off. Instead of letting jealousy get the best of him, he chose to be happy for his friend.

By his senior year, he decided to simply enjoy his final year of high school and not worry about music, auditions, and just have fun. He asked Katie to the homecoming dance, and she agreed. They went as friends, more like brother and sister than a romantic couple. Katie‚Äôs family felt like a second family to him, and being included in their circle made him feel at home.

At the dance, Lorien had a great time. Afterwards, they all went to Shannon‚Äôs house for the after-party before he eventually went home and fell asleep, content.

Back at school, in the concert choir, Mr. Thompson worked tirelessly to get the students to sing at their best. One day, he called on Lorien. ‚ÄúYour mom told me you conduct choir at church. I‚Äôd like you to conduct one piece for the concert choir this semester.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Lorien asked, surprised.

‚ÄúI would love to do that,‚Äù he replied enthusiastically.

Meanwhile, the marching band season was not going as planned. Scores weren‚Äôt meeting expectations, and both staff and students were concerned. After a recent competition, the instructors and students gathered in the band room to review the performance tapes.

Chris, a trumpet player, spoke up. ‚ÄúOur show doesn‚Äôt really have a theme. Is it possible for us to have a theme with a title, so the judges can follow along?

Skyler, one of the instructors, shook his head. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt matter. In drum corps, they have different themes‚Äîor sometimes no theme at all‚Äîand they still earn high scores.‚Äù

Chris, I believe that us not having a theme really hurts us; nobody understands the show.

Skyler, we have been doing this for a long time, and we know what we are talking about. Let us worry about scoring and you all just worry about marching and playing.

Although everyone was silent, the students all sided with Chris.

After rehearsal, Lorien headed to Great Savings, where he worked as a cashier. His shift ended around 9:30 p.m., and he made it home just in time to be in bed by 10.

As marching season began winding down, Jason gathered the drumline after practice. ‚ÄúHey everyone,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about starting an indoor drumline. I really like indoor competitions because it‚Äôs just percussion, and it gives us the chance to compete with other schools in the district. What do you all think about starting after nationals?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a great idea,‚Äù Sam said.

‚ÄúSame here,‚Äù Katie added.

Lorien nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, I think it would be good for us too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright then,‚Äù Jason smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you all more information soon.‚Äù

Back at school, the football team‚Äôs playoff run hadn‚Äôt gone well, so their season was over. leaving them with plenty of free time during sixth period.

One day, Adam called over to Lorien. ‚ÄúHey, what are you guys doing today? We‚Äôre just working on tennis.‚Äù

Lorien looked confused. ‚ÄúUh, tennis? You‚Äôre on the tennis team?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Adam said with a grin. ‚ÄúWhere do you need me?‚Äù

Lorien gave him a puzzled look.¬†*Why is he talking to me, and why does he want to join my team?*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should play with us,‚Äù Lorien said hesitantly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre way too advanced.‚Äù

‚ÄúAw, stop pushing me away, Lorien,‚Äù Adam teased. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing‚Äîend of discussion. I‚Äôll serve!‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Lorien sighed, laughing a little. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm terrible at tennis.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo worries,‚Äù Adam replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good teacher.‚Äù

Lorien didn‚Äôt play very well, but they still won the match and had a great time.

‚ÄúNot bad for your first time,‚Äù Adam said, smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you later.‚Äù

Marching band season finally came to a close. At State Finals, the band earned 3rd place, and at Nationals, they received an overall Division I rating. Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt make the night show to advance to the final rounds.

As the holiday break approached, everyone was looking forward to some time off. It was December, and only two weeks of school remained. During gym class one day, the students decided to play volleyball, and even the football players joined in.

In the middle of the game, Lorien jumped into the rotation, eager to play. His competitive side kicked in‚Äîhe wanted to win. When one of his serves didn‚Äôt go well, Adam told him to switch places so they‚Äôd have a better chance at victory.

‚ÄúAdam, Lorien‚Äîswitch with me,‚Äù Adam insisted.

‚ÄúNo, I got this,‚Äù Lorien said, determined.

‚ÄúLorien, switch quickly so you don‚Äôt have to serve in the rotation!‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you, I got this,‚Äù Lorien repeated.

Adam sighed and sat down, frustrated. But when it was Lorien‚Äôs turn to serve again, he hit the ball perfectly over the net. The other team couldn‚Äôt return it, and his side won the game.

Everyone in the gym cheered. ‚ÄúWhoa, you did it!‚Äù

Adam rushed over to Lorien, laughing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sooo sorry, man!‚Äù He opened his arms and hugged Lorien for a long time. In the locker room afterward, Adam apologized again and gave him another hug. For some reason, Adam really enjoyed being around Lorien.

The Robinson family decided not to go to Tennessee for the holiday break because Hannah was expecting a baby in March. They stayed home for Christmas, celebrating together. Every family member received an iPod that year, and they all made sure to get Hannah a special gift too.

A few days later, Kyle‚Äîwho had graduated the previous year‚Äîhosted a Christmas party at his house. Everyone showed up: Kacie, Tony, Sam, Christina, Linda, and more.

‚ÄúChristina, look at her,‚Äù Katie whispered, nodding toward Kacie. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs all over Sam‚Äîand now Eli too. It‚Äôs gross how she throws herself at every guy.‚Äù

Christina laughed and called out, mimicking Kacie. ‚ÄúSam, who am I?‚Äù She did a fake giggle. ‚ÄúAh ha ha!‚Äù

Katie, Sam, Lorien, and Christina burst out laughing, and Christina teased Sam to be careful.

While Lorien was chatting with Tony, he felt a tap on his shoulder. When he turned around, it was Talan, who had brought a few friends to the party.

Talan raised his eyebrows playfully, as he always did when he saw Lorien. ‚ÄúHey, how are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù Lorien said. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs college going?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going well,‚Äù Talan replied. ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôve turned into the popular guy around here.‚Äù

Lorien laughed. ‚ÄúNah, still the same old me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you really haven‚Äôt changed much,‚Äù Talan said with a grin.

‚ÄúWell, you have,‚Äù Lorien replied. ‚ÄúNew hairstyle?‚Äù

Talan chuckled, brushing his short, curly hair. ‚ÄúYeah, I was inspired by Justin Timberlake.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you know what we should do again?‚Äù Talan said suddenly.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Lorien asked.

‚ÄúRemember two years ago when I was a senior, and we went Christmas caroling? We should do that again!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, too bad it‚Äôs two days after Christmas,‚Äù Lorien replied.

‚ÄúPeople are still into the holiday spirit two days after Christmas,‚Äù Talan said with a smile.

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Lorien admitted.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm heading home. It was good talking to you, Talan.‚Äù

‚ÄúSame here,‚Äù Talan said, giving him a friendly nod.

Lorien said goodbye to everyone else, then headed home, smiling to himself as the night came to an end.

¬†

The second semester had just started when Ms. Benson called Lorien into her office.

‚ÄúLorien,‚Äù she began kindly, ‚ÄúI know you want to study music in college. You should really consider going to a smaller performing arts school instead of a major university. That way, you can really focus on your music.‚Äù

Lorien nodded, though his heart was already set on Smoky Mountain University in Tennessee. Still, he decided to keep his options open and planned to audition for a few smaller schools‚Äîjust in case.

There was only one problem‚ÄîLorien hadn‚Äôt taken the ACT, and it was already his second semester of senior year.

One afternoon, while he was filling out college applications, Mr. Jones walked by. ‚ÄúSmoky Mountain, huh?‚Äù he said, peeking over Lorien‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôll need to take the ACT for that school. It‚Äôs not like a small conservatory where they only look at your audition.‚Äù

Lorien‚Äôs stomach dropped. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîwhat? I didn‚Äôt even think about that! I just wanted to be part of their marching band and study music.‚Äù

Mr. Jones smiled reassuringly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll help you get ready for the ACT.‚Äù

Since Lorien no longer had gym, he needed to fill his schedule with other classes. He chose Computer Keyboarding and Media and Communication.

Ms. Marcell, his Media and Communication teacher, spoke slowly and ended nearly every sentence the same way.  
‚ÄúHi, you guyssss‚Ä¶ welcome to Media and Communication class,‚Äù she said in a drawn-out voice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to talk about media and communications, you guys. Fill out this survey and turn it in at the end of class, you guys‚Ä¶ give me a second, I have a headache. Alright, you guys, that‚Äôs all I have. See ya next class!‚Äù

Lorien chuckled to himself as he packed up his things.

Later that day, he went to his computer class, where¬†**Sabrina**¬†was also enrolled. When class ended, he started walking toward rehearsal, but he heard someone calling his name.

‚ÄúLorien!‚Äù

He turned and saw¬†**Adam**¬†jogging to catch up.

Sabrina smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you two to talk,‚Äù she said before walking off.

‚ÄúHow was your break?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúIt was good,‚Äù Lorien said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got Government with Mr. Hall this semester. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got Computers with Ms. Forbes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs funny,‚Äù Lorien replied. ‚ÄúOur classes are right next to each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, strange how that worked out,‚Äù Adam said with a grin.

‚ÄúToo bad we‚Äôre not in the same class,‚Äù Lorien said. ‚ÄúI already took Government last semester.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, gotcha. You have anything going on after school?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got lessons,‚Äù Lorien replied.

‚ÄúOh, okay. Well, I don‚Äôt have anything now since I quit basketball.‚Äù

Lorien gave a small smile. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find something to do. I‚Äôve got to get to rehearsal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Adam said. ‚ÄúCatch you later.‚Äù

Indoor drumline season was about to start, and Bradley, another snare player from Lakeland High School, joined the group. Jason approached Sam and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving the section leader position to Lorien. I think they‚Äôll work well together, and both of their auditions were really strong.‚Äù

Sam felt a pang of disappointment but quickly brushed it off. He was genuinely happy for Lorien. Sam, a beach-blonde guy, was a talented snare player and a dependable teammate.

‚ÄúAlright, drumline,‚Äù Jason called. ‚ÄúMake sure you have your sticks and practice pads. Sectionals are Saturday morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee you Saturday,‚Äù Lorien said to Bradley.

Spring break was approaching, and Lorien had a lot on his plate, but he managed everything well. Choir was going smoothly, and Tony asked if he had any after-school plans. Lorien explained he needed to practice for upcoming auditions, which he did diligently.

Later, while heading to the vending machine upstairs, Lorien ran into Adam.

‚ÄúHi Lorien! What are you doing at school on a Friday?‚Äù Adam asked.

‚ÄúI wanted a snack,‚Äù Lorien replied. ‚ÄúSchool closes at 5, and we‚Äôve been out since 2:30. I was also planning to practice for my auditions in March. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI needed a snack too, but I was also catching up on a project I missed while I was absent. Want to grab dinner? I‚Äôll drive.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Lorien agreed.

Adam‚Äôs black Explorer took them to a nearby restaurant. He paid for dinner and drove Lorien back home. ‚ÄúI had a good night,‚Äù Lorien said.

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThanks for dinner!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù Adam replied with a smile.

By March, Lorien had already auditioned for one school in Indiana and was preparing for another near West Virginia. Indoor drumline was thriving. Kacie, Sam, Bradley, Taylor, and Katie often hung out after practice, enjoying the company of the season.

One Sunday, Lorien was called into the office by his boss, Jane.

‚ÄúHi Jane, I need to clock in,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBefore you do that, we need to talk,‚Äù she replied, closing the door behind them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Lorien, but Great Savings is closing. You‚Äôre being laid off. Your last paycheck will arrive in two weeks.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù Lorien asked quietly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done a good job, but you worked the fewest hours. It‚Äôs nothing personal,‚Äù Jane explained.

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù Lorien said and walked home.

Melissa greeted him as he entered. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got laid off. The store‚Äôs closing,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOh, Lorien. I‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôll find another job. It‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù Melissa reassured him.

Still, Lorien couldn‚Äôt help but worry. How would he pay for his lessons now?

Mr. Jones had been helping him prepare for the ACT the following Saturday, before spring break. Lorien took the first round of the ACT, hoping to attend Smoky Mountain University in Tennessee and audition there.

Spring break arrived, and Lorien had an important audition scheduled for Saturday. But Wednesday morning brought an unexpected surprise: Luca rushed into his room.

‚ÄúLorien! Move Dad‚Äôs car! The baby‚Äôs coming!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Lorien exclaimed.

‚ÄúHannah‚Äôs about to have the baby, it‚Äôs happening right now!‚Äù

Lorien froze. The baby‚Äôs arrival could change everything. Would he have to cancel his audition? How would this shift the family dynamic?

Still, he jumped into action, moving the car. His mind raced with questions, but before he could think any further, his phone buzzed. It was an email notification. Lorien unlocked it and read the subject line: ‚ÄúAudition Update.‚Äù

Lorien froze. For the first time, he realized that by the end of the day, everything could change, family, future, and dreams at once.",1,1761225274.0,ShortyStories,0,1.0,False
1oe2y8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Skate4/comments/1oe2y8x/why_the_level_design_of_skate_failed/,Why the level design of skate failed,"There has been widespread online discussion about Skate feeling empty, soulless, and lacking. I believe the level design and environmental story are the largest contributing factors to this. This can be further divided into three parts: bad level design, fragmented visual identity, and uncanny valley. I'll explore each below.

**1. Bad level design**

Flow-Killing Design: Excessive clutter‚Äîplanters, bins, lamp posts‚Äîdisrupts lines constantly. Curbs interrupt approaches with minimal setup space. Cramped areas pack ramps, ledges, and rails too tightly together. Lines end in impossible gaps or unusably close stair sets. Sculptures are often unskateable. While some sections work, these issues persist map-wide.

Wasted Space: The entire coastline is a massive perimeter road with uninspiring spots. The city skywalk is equally forgettable. What purpose do these serve?

The Speed Problem: Downhill ramps build momentum but lead into walls, flat landings, or dead ends. Obstacles ignore the speed you'll carry based on surroundings‚Äîa fundamental oversight.

**2. Fragmented Visual Identity**

The map's visual themes are scattered rather than consolidated into cohesive districts. Elements that could form a unified business district are separated across the map, as are components of what should be a hip post-industrial brick quarter and other distinct areas. This fragmentation prevents zones from establishing a clear character and severely undermines the sense of exploration as locations feel like small set-pieces instead of distinct, larger districts. Here is an example of how they could have structured the map to establish strong visual identities:

¬∑¬†City Centre: A high-tech business hub featuring modern plazas and corporate towers, and an indoor shopping mall.

¬∑¬†Central Park: A green recreational space at the heart of the map

¬∑¬†Old Town: An extensive historic quarter with cobblestone streets, traditional architecture, and public pools

¬∑¬†Industrial District: A gritty warehouse zone with heavy machinery, loading bays, and an indoor skatepark

¬∑¬†Underground Network: A sewer system with interconnected tunnels and pipelines extending to the waterfront

¬∑¬†Dockside Feature: A stationary cruise ship converted into a skateable attraction or theme park on a boardwalk

Having a large, distinct area with a specific visual theme could help improve the feeling of exploration and give each area of the map a strong, memorable identity. This is something Skate 2 and 3 managed to present much better. The next section will flesh out the problem with NPCs, environmental storytelling, and how they compound this problem.

**3. Uncanny valley**

The city lacks a believable social fabric‚Äîno security guards, suited businesspeople, gardeners, hipsters, construction workers, or beachgoers. Everyone dresses identically regardless of location or socioeconomic context. Despite numerous clothing options, NPC characters constantly repeat with no distinction between run-down neighbourhoods and upscale areas in attire, shops, advertising, or vehicles.

NPCs stand idle instead of performing natural activities‚Äîreading, sitting, drinking coffee, or queuing (at currently unmanned food stalls?). Environmental logic is absent: hot dog carts have massive billboard campaigns, generic assets repeat endlessly, advertising doesn't match surroundings, and paint-splattered plywood inexplicably covers expensive corporate offices as decoration while a 20-foot wooden quarter-pipe sits atop a 40-story tower.

There's no environmental storytelling‚Äîwe don't understand why people hate M-Corp or what defines each district's character, or how people live. This makes the city feel sterile and uninhabited rather than lived-in, lacking the contextual details and narrative grounding needed to feel authentic. Instead, we have the same handful of NPCs wearing the same clothing everywhere, doing nothing.

**Conclusion: A Hollow Fa√ßade**

This isn't a city; it's a collection of disconnected environmental set pieces with no grounding in a coherent world. The map construction is poor: areas blend without visual identity, entire sections serve no purpose, and the uncanny valley shatters any immersion. It's pretending to be somewhere real, but you see straight through the empty imitation. Any suspension of disbelief collapses on first contact.

This write-up doesn't even address the missing pro skateboarders or narrative elements that would ground you in the skating subculture and give your exploration of the city further meaning and context.

Perhaps this could be forgiven if the skateable areas were fun. Instead, the map design is weak, cluttered, and thoughtless‚Äîlacking flow and inspiration at every turn. Combined with a lifeless world devoid of character, Skate's map is a fundamental failure that undermines the entire experience. This is why the game world feels hollow, uninspired, and ""soulless"" above all else.",12,1761225269.0,Skate4,24,0.71,False
1oe2y6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1oe2y6n/the_missing_poster/,The Missing Poster,"

I‚Äôve been a police officer for ten years. A few weeks ago, I found my niece‚Äôs face on a missing poster. The date on it was the day I found it.


I started my shift just like any other, with a cup of coffee.
Ten years on the job, caffeine‚Äôs basically part of the uniform.


Get to work.
Throw on my uniform.
Grab the keys to my sector car.
Get the coffee flowing through my veins as fast as possible.

My routine rarely strays. I stop at the same coffee shop five minutes from the precinct. They know my name. They know my order. I could walk in half asleep and still leave with exactly what I need.

While I waited at the counter, my eyes drifted over to the cork board near the door. The one layered with half torn flyers and yellowed business cards.

Landscapers looking for work.
A babysitter trying to pick up extra hours.
A dog walker for people too lazy or too busy to do it themselves.

Just as my name was called, something new caught my eye.

A missing poster.

I don‚Äôt remember ever seeing one there before. Maybe I never paid attention.

I grabbed my coffee and stepped toward the board. I took a closer look, tugging the paper free from the thumbtack.

The photo stopped me cold.

It wasn‚Äôt a blurry security image or a kid who looked kind of familiar.

It was my niece.

Her school photo.

The same one my sister keeps on the fridge. The same one I carry in my wallet.

Above the picture, bold black letters.

MISSING
Last seen:

The date written there was the same day I was standing in that coffee shop, holding it.



I didn‚Äôt have time to be confused.
My hands were already patting my pockets, searching for my phone.
When I realized it was still in the car, I ran, shoulder checking the door on my way out, nearly spilling someone‚Äôs latte as I pushed past.

No missed calls. No voicemails. No texts.
I hit my sister‚Äôs number.

No answer.
Tried again.
Nothing.

I kept calling the whole drive over. Each ring felt longer than the last.

I pulled up hard in front of her house, tires scraping against the curb.
My niece‚Äôs scooter was still on the porch from the night before, lying on its side.

I rang the bell, then knocked, then called her name.

The door flew open.
My sister stood there, hair wet, bathrobe disheveled, eyes wide like she‚Äôd just run from the shower.

For a second she just stared at me, confused, trying to place why I was there.
Then she saw the crumpled flyer in my hand.

The color drained from her face.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù she whispered.



I stepped inside. She knew something was wrong before I said a word.

I held out the paper. ‚ÄúLook at this.‚Äù

Her eyes went wide. For a second she didn‚Äôt breathe.
‚ÄúWhat the hell is this? She‚Äôs fine, she‚Äôs at school!‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I saw her get on the bus just like every morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúCall the school,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre scaring me. Why wouldn‚Äôt she be there?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust call.‚Äù

She grabbed her phone with shaking hands. I turned away, trying to keep my head clear.
I needed to radio this in, tell a supervisor, something.

There was no chance in hell I could finish my shift without knowing she was safe.

I walked into the kitchen, trying to gather my thoughts.
Mind racing.

The fridge caught my eye.
The picture, her school photo, the one that I had grown accustomed to seeing, was gone.

I went back to the living room. My sister was standing still, phone slipping from her hand.
It hit the floor and bounced once against her bare foot.

Tears filled her eyes.
‚ÄúShe never made it,‚Äù she whispered.



I called my supervisor and explained the situation.
Told him we had a missing juvenile.
Told him about the missing poster I found.

He assured me that all hands would be on deck and told me to wait there so my sister and I could give statements when the other officers and detectives arrived.

Even though my sister was distraught, we still needed answers.
I asked her about the missing photo from the fridge.

She looked confused.
‚ÄúI never took that photo down. Why would I?‚Äù

The pit that had already settled in my stomach felt like it was spreading through the rest of my body.

I told my sister not to move and stood up slowly.
I took the gun from my holster and began to clear the house.

Something hung over the place.
I can‚Äôt put words to it, but it didn‚Äôt feel right.

The last room left to check was my niece‚Äôs.
I opened the door and stepped inside, ready to confront anyone, or anything I saw.

Her room was always a disaster.
Clothes on the floor, toys everywhere, half finished drawings on the desk.

Now it was spotless.
Bed made with perfect corners.
Toys put away in every bin they belonged in.
No clothes on the floor.
Not even dust on the dresser.

I called for my sister.
She came to the doorway and froze.

‚ÄúDid you clean this? Did she clean this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Her voice was flat, empty. Then she broke down crying.



The first unit showed up less than ten minutes after I called it in.
Blue lights rolled across the front of the house, painting the walls.
Two uniforms came through the door, calm but moving fast. One of them knew me. He didn‚Äôt say anything, just gave a small nod that seemed to say we got it from here.

I holstered my weapon and stepped back toward the kitchen. The energy drained out of me all at once. I could feel the weight of the gun pulling at my belt, the sweat drying cold under my vest.

A detective arrived next, followed by crime scene techs. They moved quietly, professional. My sister sat at the table with a blanket over her shoulders, answering the same questions again and again. I tried to focus on the facts for my statement. Time, location, who found what, but my mind kept jumping back to that room.

A tech brushed powder over the doorframe, then over the dresser. Nothing but smudges. He went to the window next. After a minute he called the detective over.

They had found prints on the inside glass. Small ones. Too small to be mine, too defined to be old.

Outside, the radios crackled. More units canvassing the neighborhood, checking the bus stops, talking to anyone awake.

I stood by the front window watching the reflection of red and blue pulse across the street. Then a voice came over the radio.

‚ÄúDispatch, we‚Äôve got something at the bus stop. Another poster. Different photo, same handwriting.‚Äù

Everyone in the room went still.

The detective looked at me.
‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he said quietly, and headed for the door.

I watched him leave, lights spilling after him into the dark.

I wasn‚Äôt about to just stand there so I followed.

The photo seemed to be taken that morning.
My niece standing at the bus stop, backpack on, head turned toward the street.

The detective asked, ‚ÄúYou take this?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.

Because we both knew I hadn‚Äôt.



The detective kept the photo sealed in an evidence sleeve. He told me to go home, get some rest, let them handle the canvass.
I nodded, but we both knew I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep.

My sister needed me. My niece needed me.
I walked back to the house to tell my sister what we‚Äôd seen. Her world was crashing down around her. She shouldn‚Äôt be alone.

I convinced her to grab a few things and come stay with me until we figured this out. With no other choice, she agreed.

We stopped by the precinct to pick up my personal car.
Not many words between us.

I looked over at her.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find her,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to find her.‚Äù

No response. She just stared out the window.

When we pulled into my driveway, I got out first and grabbed her bag from the back seat.
The porch light flickered once as we walked up.

Something was stuck to the front door.

Even before I read it, I knew what it was.

Another missing poster.

Another different photo.

It was from my birthday.
My niece hugging me, both of us smiling at the camera.

A picture that only I had.
A picture that was in my living room.



The detectives came to sweep my house.

The doorframe showed no forced entry. No prints.
The birthday photo was gone.

That night, sleep never came.
My sister was on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, the TV still playing from where we‚Äôd left it. The volume was low, a soft hum under the silence.

I checked the doors twice. Then a third time. Every lock. Every window.

When I walked back into the living room, my sister had finally drifted off, exhaustion winning over panic.
I went to grab another blanket for her.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the empty space on the wall.

I couldn‚Äôt believe someone had been in my house.
I couldn‚Äôt believe ANY of this was happening.

Then I heard it.

A faint whirring sound from down the hall.

I followed it toward my office. The sound grew louder, steady.

When I opened the door, the printer on my desk was running.
Pages spilling onto the floor.

I stepped closer and picked one up.

A missing poster.

Same format. Same bold letters.

Each one a different photo of my niece.

A while ago I built a small expense tracker with Expo, where all data was stored in Google Sheets.  
After a few months of work, I decided to rebuild it completely - this time fully offline, faster, and with native iCloud backups.

The result is [**Moneyra**](http://moneyra.app), now live on the App Store.

**Stack highlights:**

* **Expo SDK 53** (new architecture enabled)
* **WatermelonDB** for local-first data
* **iCloud backups** for safe automatic sync
* **NativeWind + Tailwind** for styling
* **Reanimated** for animations
* **RevenueCat** for subscriptions

If you‚Äôre curious how it‚Äôs built - the full source code of Moneyra is available inside my template NativeLaunch.

I and most people at my M7 (and surely the same at most T15 as well) were extremely good academically. I graduated summa cum laude. Plenty of HYSP types as well. Academics is something I care about and something I pride myself on. 

For this reason, part of me regretted choosing a non disclosure school. I wanted the classic grad school experience. I wanted to learn, study in coffee shops, have late nights at the library. 

 But it is very, very difficult to excel academically while also recruiting, networking, and being social. This is not undergrad where for most questions there is a right or wrong answer. You could *always* go deeper on a group project. You could *always* find someone who worked in the industry you‚Äôre researching and completely rewrite your essay. And there will be people who are hardos, or sponsored and have more time, or on a different recruitment track than you who will do just that. 

The classes are fantastic and rigorous, especially if you weren‚Äôt a business major. But the big secret of non grade disclosure schools is that you get to decide how rigorous you want to be. To be blunt, showing up to class and doing the homework and group assignments with low effort is enough to get at B. While you are going through recruitment, that is great. But maybe the next semester you want to go deeper - that‚Äôs fine, you have that ability, take a full course load and go to office hours. 

I‚Äôm not saying that non grade disclosure should be your first priority when selecting a a school, but if you are, say, deciding between two M7s, this should be a factor. ",6,1761225093.0,MBA,2,0.8,False

*By Your Favorite Sports Oracle with a Side of Sarcasm*

**Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem**  
Let‚Äôs cut through the bookmaker noise. Aston Villa is the consensus favorite here, with odds ranging from **1.32 (FanDuel)** to **1.43 (Bovada)**. Translating that into implied probabilities, Villa‚Äôs chances of winning sit between **69.9% and 76.9%**‚Äîessentially, they‚Äôre the Kevin Durant of this matchup: unavoidable. Go Ahead Eagles, meanwhile, are priced between **6.25 and 8.0**, implying a **12.5% to 16%** chance to pull off the upset. For context, that‚Äôs about the likelihood of me remembering to water my plants. The draw? A meager **18.9% to 20.6%**, which is roughly the chance your local barista will get your coffee order right on a busy Monday.

**Digesting the News: Buendia‚Äôs Brilliance vs. Dutch Doldrums**  
Aston Villa, under Unai Emery, is riding a **five-game winning streak**, including a clinical 2-0 takedown of Eredivisie leaders Feyenoord. Their Europa League campaign has been so dominant that even their FA Cup heartbreak (a penalty shootout loss to Brentford) feels like a warmup act. Star man **Emi Buendia** has emerged as a secret weapon, netting **three goals in four games**, including a match-winner against Tottenham. If Villa‚Äôs defense is a fortress (they‚Äôve kept clean sheets in key wins), Buendia is the siege engine lobbing goals over the walls.

Go Ahead Eagles, however, are the sports equivalent of a Dutch cheese factory‚Äîpresent, but leaking in all the wrong places. Despite a thrilling 2-1 Europa League win over Panathinaikos, they‚Äôve won just **two of nine Eredivisie games** this season and sit 15 points adrift

Hi all, speaking coach here, wanted to share some ways to improve your public speaking and handling social situations especially if you suffer from social anxiety.¬† And FWIW this is coming from someone who was both sexually abused as a teenager and suffered from social anxiety as well. Unfortunately I‚Äôm a double ‚ÄòSA‚Äô person.¬†

Some of this might be different than the typical advice so wanted to post it in case its helpful to anyone.¬† And this is based on a career of speaking in public in both work and social events. I‚Äôm that weird guy that loves public speaking and would rather give a speech in front of 5000 people than ride a ferris wheel. Yuck- too high, too slow‚Ä¶.:)¬†

For clarity‚Äôs sake when I say ‚Äôspeech‚Äô or ‚Äòpresentation‚Äô, etc below I mean literally anytime you speak in front of a group. It could be a birthday party, work event or a small team meeting on zoom or wedding. And apologies in advance for grammatical errors and spelling mistakes.

In no particular order:

1. Do 360 work- work on speaking for all areas of your life, not just work. Working on your public speaking only for work situations is crazy. That would be like only working out your right arm in the gym. You‚Äôll be super strong in certain situations and terrible in the rest. There are 5 main undeniable parts of life where having strong public speaking skills are important: work, social events (parties, weddings, etc, conferences (work or personal related), school, and daily (coffee shops, getting gas, etc). You have to master public speaking in all of them. If you become a great speaker but can‚Äôt handle small talk at a wedding, you‚Äôre selling yourself short.
2. Have a pre-game plan (or ritual) for the most likely scenarios. For example, if you deal with social anxiety what‚Äôs your plan if you get into a work meeting and someone asks you to present something on the spot? What‚Äôs your plan when you walk into a party where you only know a few people? What‚Äôs your plan when you attend a conference? You should have a plan for as many potential stressful situations as possible. I‚Äôm very comfortable spekaing and I use a pre-game plan for anytime I know I‚Äôm going to speak. Usually it consists of 1- a workout the morning of where I try to focus on lifting and short but intense cardio, 2-skip my usual espresso and have a green tea (the espresso will make me talk even faster than I already do so I skip it), get to the place an hour early and walk both the area and the stage. If it‚Äôs a big meeting, I‚Äôll get there early and figure the best place to sit and walk around the room, 3- go through my highlight reel (list of accomplishments) and my daily mantras, 4- every 15 minutes or so take 3 deep breaths, 5- right before the presentation I go to the bathroom and stare at myself in the bathroom and do some positive self talk (sounds woo woo but it works for me), 6- when I enter the room I try to immediately find someone to say hi to, preferably someone who‚Äôs going to be in the audience or in the meeting. This works as a great ice breaker for me. Everyone is different but thats my pre-game plan.
3. Prep for social situations like you prep for work situations. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre going to a party or a wedding, what‚Äôs your plan when you first walk in? Do you have one? If you have any level of social anxiety or worry about public speaking I strongly suggest you have a plan. it could be as simple as ‚Äúwhen I get to the party I‚Äôm going to head straight for the food (or drinks) and say hi to whoever is there‚Äù.¬† For me, one thing i‚Äôve seen work is to go in without your phone at first. Sounds daunting but it allows you to go up to literally anyone and ask them the time, or if they have a pen, etc. It‚Äôs a great way to connect with someone right when you first walk in. You can always go out and get your phone later:)¬†
4. Have a couple of questions (open ended) ready to go that work in any work situation or social setting. My favorite is ‚Äúdo anything fun today?‚Äù.¬† It‚Äôs in incredibly easy way to connect with someone because it‚Äôs such fun question for them to answer. And it works both in social situations and work. (at work just alter the question to ‚Äòdo anything fun this weekend?‚Äô or ‚ÄúDoing anything fun this weekend?‚Äù). you‚Äôll be surprised at the answers you‚Äôll get and you‚Äôll make the other person feel at ease and have a favorable vibe about you. Way better than the typical ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù question.
5. Don‚Äôt rely on drugs. I may get downvoted for this because a lot of people take propranolol. Here‚Äôs the thing- what happens if you get to a party or event and you‚Äôre expected to give a toast and you forgot to take it? It‚Äôs way better to be intrinsically prepared than rely on a drug. I do think the drug can be a short term solution but I would try not to rely on it.
6. Be you. Or be ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô as the life coaches say. I can‚Äôt really say ‚Äòbe authentic‚Äô becuase that‚Äôs not how I talk:) The point is use your uniqueness to your advantage. You might be socially awkward (and hint: we all are) so when you go to present or are in a meeting just focus on being yourself. The WORST thing you can do is try to be someone else, other people will see right through that. Be ok with who you are, faults and all.
7. Go slow. Ever see someone nervous give a speech and they talk a mile a minute and rush through it? It sucks for them and it sucks to watch it happen. So go slow. Focus on your breathing and actively try to go. really. slow. If you‚Äôre in a meeting and someone askes for your input, take a breath and go slow.
8. Win the internal battle, win the war. Anyone on here can give you all of the extrinsic help/tools/tricks to become a good speaker. They‚Äôll tell you to focus on your body language, make solid contact, use good hand gestures, don‚Äôt say ‚Äòahh‚Äô or ‚Äòuhmm‚Äô, etc, etc. That advice is helpful to an extent. But it would be better to work on your intrinsic self so that you‚Äôre always prepared, feel confident with a strong sense of self knowing that you can speka in public easily and that you always enjoy it.¬†

Hope some of that is helpful, lmk if you have any questions. Again, I used to suffer from SA and I can promise you it will get better if you work on it so hang in there!",1,1761224521.0,publicspeakingadvice,0,1.0,False

2. Expect everything to break down all of the time. The best way to avoid tech issues, mic issues, powerpoint freeze ups, etc is to have as little tech as possible when you‚Äôre presenting. You should be able to give a 30 min presentation with a couple of index cards of bullet points. Technology fails and computers freeze up so prep accordingly. There‚Äôs also the sweet feeling of knowing you‚Äôre fully prepared even if the tech breaks down. We‚Äôve all seen plenty of speechs/presentations go to sh\*t because the tech didn‚Äôt work and the speaker got flustered.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on something that‚Äôs been on my mind.

There‚Äôs this guy I really like. He‚Äôs American, I‚Äôm German. My English isn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äì sometimes it‚Äôs a bit shaky ‚Äì but we still spend a lot of time together at university. We usually go for coffee, take walks around campus, and just talk about everything.

But‚Ä¶ he gives me mixed signals.
Sometimes when we‚Äôre talking face-to-face, he briefly looks at my lips. Not all the time, but it happens now and then ‚Äì and every time, it makes my heart skip a beat.

So today I asked him if he wanted to hang out this weekend. He was immediately down for it, and we planned to meet on Saturday around 4 PM.

We talked a bit about what we could do, and he said:

‚ÄúMaybe we could have a meal or a dinner ‚Äì like you want.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm not sure how to interpret.

As a German, I don‚Äôt fully understand how American guys use these words. I don‚Äôt know if ‚Äúdinner‚Äù is just a normal thing you say when hanging out with a friend, or if it can have a more personal or even romantic undertone ‚Äì especially when it‚Äôs your first proper time hanging out outside of class.

We also talked about possibly playing pool afterwards ‚Äì just keeping it open and relaxed.

He gives off both straight and soft boy vibes. Sometimes he feels like a typical straight dude, but sometimes he has these quiet, tender moments where it really feels like there‚Äôs something more.

So I guess my question is:
When an American guy says, ‚ÄúWe can have a meal or a dinner, like you want,‚Äù ‚Äì is that just a casual phrase between bros? Or could that be his way of suggesting something a bit more special, depending on how I respond?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any thoughts or perspectives from you guys. Especially if you‚Äôre American ‚Äì help a confused European out! üòÖüíñ",8,1761224361.0,lgbt,13,1.0,False

Even if they wasn't laughing at me you couldn't pay me to believe that he didn't do nun with them. He says I'll never believe he's committed to me while showing me absolutely fucking nothing. I never in a billion years thought he would ever cheat on me, always boohoo crying bout how he been cheated on, I thought he was too good of a man but jokes on me. I broke up w him cause he refused to stop talking to them, esp the 15 year old it's just mad inappropriate to me for them to even talk like wtf you need to give a 15 year old relationship advice for and be a shoulder to cry on. You look mad weird bro I'm not w it. But whatever. I don't know I really don't wanna get lied to anymore than I have, he has such a guilty conscious thinking Imma do him foul like it goes to show where he stands with me. I know he doesn't wanna lose me but he thinks he can't or he won't but I'm not going to be in competition with other females. I wish I didn't smoke dope , I really think it would make me a more appealing partner even tho he does too I feel like it's unattractive.

I hate the embarrassment I've faced being with this man, this lil boy. I need to boss my life up fr and I will. Just gotta want it bad enough again. This dope has a choke hold on me fr I hate it.

And I'm gonna get on my meds again, at least some of them I don't think I'm gonna do the shot every month but I'll def get on the pills again but the shot was easy cause it was just 1 time a month and boom, the pills are an every day commitment but as long as I keep them in my purse I'm good.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on something that‚Äôs been on my mind.

There‚Äôs this guy I really like. He‚Äôs American, I‚Äôm German. My English isn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äì sometimes it‚Äôs a bit shaky ‚Äì but we still spend a lot of time together at university. We usually go for coffee, take walks around campus, and just talk about everything.

But‚Ä¶ he gives me mixed signals.
Sometimes when we‚Äôre talking face-to-face, he briefly looks at my lips. Not all the time, but it happens now and then ‚Äì and every time, it makes my heart skip a beat.

So today I asked him if he wanted to hang out this weekend. He was immediately down for it, and we planned to meet on Saturday around 4 PM.

We talked a bit about what we could do, and he said:

‚ÄúMaybe we could have a meal or a dinner ‚Äì like you want.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm not sure how to interpret.

As a German, I don‚Äôt fully understand how American guys use these words. I don‚Äôt know if ‚Äúdinner‚Äù is just a normal thing you say when hanging out with a friend, or if it can have a more personal or even romantic undertone ‚Äì especially when it‚Äôs your first proper time hanging out outside of class.

We also talked about possibly playing pool afterwards ‚Äì just keeping it open and relaxed.

He gives off both straight and soft boy vibes. Sometimes he feels like a typical straight dude, but sometimes he has these quiet, tender moments where it really feels like there‚Äôs something more.

So I guess my question is:
When an American guy says, ‚ÄúWe can have a meal or a dinner, like you want,‚Äù ‚Äì is that just a casual phrase between bros? Or could that be his way of suggesting something a bit more special, depending on how I respond?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any thoughts or perspectives from you guys. Especially if you‚Äôre American ‚Äì help a confused European out! üòÖüíñ",0,1761223866.0,askgaybros,3,0.4,False

We have a 2,5 year old, no nearby family or help, I'm a SAHM, husband works 4:45pm - 11:45pm Wed-Sun. Sometimes double shift but this is our average day. 

He gets ready for work at 3pm, leave at 4pm and gets home around midnight. 

I wake up at 6am for 30 mins me-time to get ready, breakfasts, lunch boxes etc before lo wakes up for nursery. We leave 8:30, home by 11:30 (she goes 9-11). Come home, make lunch, get ready for nap at 1pm. All the cleaning and what ever else falls into that.

Dad wakes up at 12, takes 1 hour to have a coffee alone, bathroom, cigarette, another bathroom. By 1pm hes ""awake"" which is when LO goes for nap. She wakes up 2:30 and he has 30 mins with her before getting ready for work. 

She's asleep when he comes home around midnight and he takes ""care of her"" from 12-4am which means give her a milk if she wakes up. 

I sometimes resent that he gets the house from 12-4am in complete silence, plus 8 hrs sleep on top of that, 1 hr to wake up in his own time (while I've already been running like a maniac since 6am), and then gets two hours more peace and quiet before LO wakes up from nap, before he has to go to work. 

Fair enough on weekdays but I haven't slept in once in over two years, not even on my birthday. Forget about weekends. When he is off it's the same routine, never a morning coffee or breakfast or offer to take our girl outside. If I want some me-time it will just putting her in front of a screen while he watches his phone. This is not the man I thought I married. 

We are starting to resent each-other. He hates my snarky comments and I hate his lack of iniative. When LO naps we try to spend some time but he's tired of hearing me talk about how amazing our daughter did in nursery and I'm tired of hearing how much he hates his colleagues. We live seperate lives and have no interest of conversation anymore. 

I am angry all the time because I'm tired and he's tired all the time because I'm angry. 

We have had conversations, many many many times but he claims he can't get up once a month with our daughter because he has evening shifts rest of the week so it doesn't work for him. Meanwhile I'm up from 6am-11pm every day (also at the 4am wake-up). The two times he has agreed to wake up with her, he wasn't able to get up.

Is this fair on me? Am I asking too much?

I get a couple hours in the afternoon when he's off of work, which I appreciate alot, and I tell him that but Im at a point where Im having a hard time not calculating everything and every little thing sends me over the edge. 

There's many more things but I'm just curious about the division of time.

I used to think I was okay with it because after all he is the main bread winner, but after he lost our savings and borrowed money for investments that he lost and didn't tell me, and then we spent a year paying that debt off where money was insanely tight, and then the week we paid it off and he had sworn he'd never do that again, he did it again. Which we already had to put pause on our moving plans etc. The point is at this point Im thinking what is he really bringing to the table? He works all the time just to mainly pay other people back. I dont get time, help, sleep or finances taken care of at this point I feel very lost in this. ",1,1761223620.0,Marriage,11,0.6,False

Instead, I was blown away with how eloquently Olivia spoke and how she really tried to get her mom to acknowledge her feelings and understand how she essentially abandoned her at a very pivotal age.

Britani honestly seemed blindsided and I think this is because of the nature of reality tv and each of them having a different producer in their ear, egging them on.  
Britani showed up with her steamer ""coffee"" story, thinking they were going to bond over memory lane over a story she must have thought showcased her as a good mom.

Instead, Olivia really couldn't remember any of it and was ready for an honest conversation about the past and Britani was trying to stay calm and not break down on camera which left her looking emotionally stunted and very confused. She wasn't expecting this.

Olivia needed this conversation to happen, though, and kept at it. She had her confessional where she was super poised and explained that before the second marriage, Britani was a great mom, according to Olivia, until her marriage fell apart and she no longer felt safe or secure in her identity and so she adopted a new one of being Wife first, Mother at the end (maybe not even second, according to how Olivia feels).

It's obvious as a viewer that Olivia is educated, has had therapy, and has read a lot about emotional neglect and parents who may be somewhat narcissistic.

If Britani is reading this: you did something right. You can fix this. Olivia is absolutely giving you an olive branch and the producers are trying really hard to give you options to fix or try to mend this relationship. If this is your story arc, lean into it. Turn off social media for a bit and figure out WHO YOU ARE. You're not playing a role or being a character. You get to decide what you like, and what your interests are, and they have absolutely nothing at all to do with a man.

I honestly hope Britani stays on the show and makes some money so she can stand on her own and grow into an adult role where she isn't second string to anyone. From what I've read and understood about Mormonism: this isn't her fault. It's been brainwashed into her that men come first, full stop.

Well, on the first day of training I was told that I would actually be teaching adults instead of Kindergarten. I was never notified of this ahead of time and did not know that the school could switch my position without notifying me or gaining my consent first. Apparently they did this because of the school's needs, but still I was never notified. 

A few days later, I was told that they don't even have a permanent teaching position available for me. They said they would have me working as a sub and doing office work at the HQ until the end of December, and possibly have an actual teaching spot open for me in January. I haven't even been told anything about where or when I'll be moving into my own apartment (which they provide). 

All of this is just unacceptable to me. I feel completely lied to because I don't understand how the employer did not know ahead of time that they would not have a teaching position ready for me upon arrival. And it's unbelievable that they switched me to teach adults without any notification. Like I said, I wasn't even aware that they were able to switch my position without my consent, as it was not stated in the temporary contract. Why would they have me come to Korea under these circumstances? I feel like they had me come here just to fill in the gaps when/wherever needed until they find me a permanent job.

In the employee handbook, it states that my contract cannot be altered during the training period without it being considered a broken contract. It seems like I can renegotiate the contract length still, but at this point, I'd rather go home than work for a company that has lied from the start. I'm just afraid that they'll charge me for staying at their guest home during this training period, which is free. 

The training is unpaid, I paid for my own medical exam and ARC application, and they did not pay for my flight here. To my knowledge, they have only paid for my VISA invitation, bought me coffee and lunch a couple of times, picked me up from the airport, bought me a few basic groceries upon arrival, gave me a giftcard, and are allowing me to stay in this guesthome for free (utilities and wifi included).

I'd like to mention is that everyone has been kind and I do feel like they are quite generous compared to some other hagwons, but I simply cannot accept the switch up upon my arrival in terms of my teaching position. I'm completely disappointed and frustrated that they do not have a permanent position for me and changed my position without asking, yet still made me move my whole life here. If they didn't need me until a later time, why not tell me that?

I don't know if my situation isn't that serious and I'm overreacting? I'm crying every day wanting to go home since it's completely not what I was told upon my hiring and signing of the temporary contract. I feel like they just had me come here to use me as a backup supply. Though, I feel like my feelings are understandable since I was essentially lied to.

Orientation ends next week, they do not yet owe me any money since the training is unpaid. I'm thinking of waiting until my supposed permanent contract is given to me by the end of next week to see if they can promise me any permanent position anytime soon? I heard a teacher is leaving in February/March next year, and I'll likely take his position. But that's half a year of waiting and being a sub/office worker in the meantime. I don't think I even want to stay with a company that thinks its okay to do this. 

Any advice on what I should do or opinions of my situation? I just don't want to get into any legal troubles :((",1,1761222776.0,teachinginkorea,2,1.0,False

Casa Mexicana ([https://www.casamexicanacozumel.com/en](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ExternalLinkInterstitial?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.casamexicanacozumel.com%2Fen)) - 1 night

4\*: Will seek out in the future

Pros: Location, view, you can drink the water, included breakfast  
Cons: WiFi wasn‚Äôt spectacular in our room - but it sort of worked

Spent our first night of the trip at Casa Mexicana. We will definitely stay there again if we‚Äôre looking for a ‚Äúhotel‚Äù type place to stay instead of a condo/villa.

The location is great - within walking distance of a huge number of restaurants, stores, souvenir shops, etc., etc. Our ocean view room was clean, comfortable - and had a great view.

The staff was super friendly, and the included breakfast is absolutely awesome.

WiFi was a bit spotty - but other than that, it was great stay for our first evening.

4\*: Will seek out in the future

Pros: Just about everything  
Cons: Bit of a long drive south of town

Private beach, ocean views, amazing sunsets, super clean with all the amenities. The rooms are large, each with its own full bathroom. The kitchen is well stocked with everything needed to cook, make drinks, etc.

The location within Costa Del Sol is perfect - it is right on the beach, tucked away in the corner and insulated from the other villas - but right next to the pool and the dock.

The view from the house was just breathtaking. The house itself is gorgeous with plenty of room for a large group. We had 7 people, and I think you could have had another 7 and not seemed crowded.

The first floor has the kitchen, living room, and 3 bedrooms. The second floor is the gigantic master bedroom and a giant open air covered deck.

The second floor deck is spacious and looks out over the ocean and beach that is in front of the property. On the deck there are couches, chairs, daybeds, a table, a refrigerator, and two Weber Genesis propane grills.

Host was great, communication was easy. Beautiful grounds, beautiful villa, everything is true to the pictures.

4\*: Will seek out in the future

Pros: Location, views/people watching  
Cons: No ocean access

Very centrally located, attractive condo, with a good view and wonderful people watching. Right across the street from Mega and next door/in front of the Naval base.

Loved the interior decor - beautiful colors, great artwork, Alebrijes, nice tile.

Big and comfortable bed, balcony with sea view - and by the kitchen area a small balcony overlooking the city. The kitchen has everything you need. Fast wifi.

If you‚Äôre a light sleeper who likes to sleep in - you‚Äôll want to close the doors between the ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù and the main room of the studio to block out early morning road noise from Melgar, and you might get woken up by Navy noises starting around 8am. The host does provide earplugs if you need them.

A very nice place to stay if you‚Äôre looking for a small (\~500 sq. ft.) studio that is centrally located and has an ocean view.



Car Rental:

Darth Car Rental (https://www.facebook.com/DarthCarRentalsCZM/)

2\*: Might use again but probably not

Pros: Service was good and on time  
Cons: Vans were sketchy, all in price didn‚Äôt include tax, accused of taking van to mainland

Went with Darth Car Rental because they were one of the only rental places with a minivan, and we needed room for 7 people. In the past we‚Äôve always used Isis, and never had an issue other than occasional vehicles which weren‚Äôt in a state of perfect maintenance.

Everything started great - we had a 10am meet up scheduled, and they were right on time. Went to pay and got the ‚ÄúOh, if you‚Äôre paying with credit card we‚Äôll have to charge you the 18% tax‚Äù. No problem - I‚Äôm not looking to help them commit tax evasion, so I paid the extra 18%.

The van had a cracked windshield, the interior was not in great shape, and it had the buzzing auto locks - but hey, it‚Äôs a Mexican rental car. No big deal.

We drive around town a bit while waiting for everyone‚Äôs flights to arrive. This is when I notice it needs a transmission service (or it‚Äôs just low on fluid) - jerky 1st to 2nd shifts. We parked by Hemingways and while sitting on the bench, I notice the hub caps are zip tied on‚Ä¶ and each front wheel is missing a lug nut. Hmm‚Ä¶ well, 4 out of 5 ain‚Äôt bad and the wheels aren‚Äôt going to fall off.

While picking folks up from the airport - the van begins to have a fast idle issue - meaning you have to put it in neutral every time you stop or it stalls out, because the torque converter is never coming out of lockout.

I drove it as is until Tuesday (4 days)... when I get a text message from Darth accusing us of taking the van to the mainland - I told him we were at Costa del Sol, but he really didn‚Äôt seem to believe it until I texted him photos of the van in the parking area. Then he was very apologetic - but told me he needed to come the next day and exchange the van due to some paperwork issues.

Wednesday came and we exchanged the van for another Chrysler Town and Country minivan that I hoped would be better - but it was just different. No real noticeable mechanical issues - but the AC didn‚Äôt work, the backup camera didn‚Äôt work, traction control light was always on, and low tire pressure light was always on.

We returned the van on Saturday with no issues.

Service (other than accusing us of leaving the island) was largely good - good communication and delivery and pickup went well. The vehicles‚Ä¶ not great Bob. Between the busted vans, the accusations, and the tax avoidance - I can‚Äôt recommend them.



Bike Rental:

Rent A Bike Cozumel (https://www.rentabikecozumel.com/)

4\*: Will seek out in the future

Pros: Great delivery/pickup, good bike  
Cons: none

Rented a Specialized Cirrus Hybrid + emergency kit for 4 days to ride the full island loop. Delivery and pickup were right on time and easy. Bike was in good shape and worked well. Brought my clipless pedals/shoes and they installed them for me.

Bike came with two water bottles and a lock - never used the lock, but the water bottles plus my Camelbak came in real handy doing the almost 40 mile loop.

I was out the door at 6:20am for the ride trying to beat the heat. Ride went really well - averaged almost 14mph, had no issues with the bike, and had a wonderful ride.

Made the turn from the east side onto the transversal about 8:30am - so the cash I brought to stop and get a beer on the east side was a bit pointless‚Ä¶ no place had opened for the day when I went past.

Would have averaged over 14mph, but I missed my turn on the backside of town and ended up riding right through town and down Melgar with all the traffic. Good thing I‚Äôm used to riding in lots of traffic, and thankfully it moves so slow I had no problem staying right on the bumper of the car in front of me. I will say riding the Transversal -> PJC -> Calle 2 Nte. -> Melgar - > Old coast road past the ferry pier and all the cruise terminals is not for the faint of heat, or folks who are bothered by riding in traffic.

Will definitely rent from them again - service and communication were great, prices were good, and everything was easy.

  
Now onto food and drink, maybe my favorite category. A bit of an unfair one also, as most places on the list are old favorites that we make a point of going to every time we‚Äôre on the island.

Cerveceria Punta Sur

Great little microbewery with fantastic beers and even better food. I had the Lionfish ceviche and session IPA, and my wife had the Beet salad and a beer flight. Everything I have ordered here is great - pizza, salad, ceviche‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had a bad dish. The decor is great.

Lots of Michigan craft brew stickers (one of the owners is from my hometown and her parents live right by my Dad), and cool artwork. Always make it a point to stop here.



El Moro

As always, we made it to El Moro. As always, it was interesting finding parking - but we managed. I had Ceviche and Sopa de Lima (best on the Island), the wife had the lobster Moro, and a few folks ordered garlic shrimp‚Ä¶ and their wonderful Margaritas. Food was great.

Service was good, as it always is for us at El Moro. Just wish I had leftovers.

We always try to hit the Sunday breakfast/brunch buffet at Los Molcajetes (inside Hotel Bello Caribe). All your Mexican breakfast favorites, in a great atmosphere, for a super low price.

Coffee and juice are also included.



Gusto's

Ate their food twice on this trip - the first time takeout pizza, the second dining in.

Pizza: we ordered a lobster pizza, a shrimp pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and a vegetarian pizza. I did not have any of the vegetarian pizza, but everyone in the group that ate it said it was really good. Both the lobster and shrimp pizza were delicious - I definitely recommend them. The pepperoni was meh for me - the pepperoni was actually some other cured sausage. Not bad though‚Ä¶ and the crust was great on all the pizza.

Dine in: Decor is great, a really attractive setting - nice stained glass‚Ä¶ and you couldn‚Äôt beat the 80‚Äôs music videos from a 40 year old worn out VHS tape playing on the TV‚Äôs.

We had coconut shrimp (not cheap, but really good), King Crab (amazingly good, seemed like a large portion for the price, fresh), shrimp scampi (good), and lobster bisque (pretty meh). Drinks were also very good.

It‚Äôs not inexpensive (but not super expensive), and we really enjoyed the food.



Jeannie‚Äôs

2\*: Might use again but probably not

Ate there twice - once for lunch, once for breakfast.

Lunch: Stopped here for lunch on the day we were dropping everyone at the airport. We were waiting at Mega for a couple folks who were souvenir shopping on Melgar, and some folks in the group wanted to get something to eat. Not wanting to get far from where the shoppers were expecting to find us - we went and had lunch at Jeannies.

We had the Arrechera tacos, Pulpo Al Pastor tacos, ceviche, and coconut shrimp. Everything was very‚Ä¶ meh. Not bad, but just nothing particularly special. Had better examples of all at other places we ate on the trip.

Breakfast: Sure‚Ä¶ lunch was not great, but they're known for their breakfast - and it was 50 yards down the street from the condo and we didn‚Äôt really want to walk anywhere far.

I had Huevos Motulenos and my wife had Huevos Poblanos. Like lunch it was‚Ä¶ just Ok. Not bad, but nothing to be excited about. Not nearly as good as the same dishes from the breakfast buffet at Los Molcajetes.

Location is great - nice views, right across from Mega, etc. Food was just nothing at all special.



La Internacional

4\*: Will seek out in the future

As craft brew aficionados, my wife and I really enjoyed La Internacional. We were the only folks there, and we spent a couple hours chatting with bartender/owner Juan and drinking delicious craft beers. My favorite was the La Lupulosa by Cervecer√≠a Insurgente.

Not a huge selection on tap (but several good beers) - but a massive selection in bottles, and a knowledgeable bartender to give recommendations.

If you‚Äôre a craft beer fan, you need to stop in here.

Delicious food (mostly Italian oriented) in a beautiful setting. We ate here for our 25th anniversary dinner. We split a Goats and Greens salad, Prosciutto wrapped Sea Scallops entree, and a slice of Key Lime pie for dessert. Everything was wonderful, and the Sangria to wash it down was great as always.

The location/decor is great for an anniversary dinner, the food is wonderful, and the service is top notch.

Hi all,

I was diagnosed last year and started medication a couple of weeks ago so I‚Äôm still in the trial phase. I‚Äôm 33, 160lbs, 5‚Äô7‚Äù, if it matters. My basic symptoms are usually a loud active brain leading to inattention (being in my head), fidgeting, forgetfulness, procrastinating, impatience, hate doing anything ‚Äúboring‚Äù. Can only work with a fire under my ass etc. 

I started off on methylphenidate starting dose, 5mg twice a day, didn‚Äôt feel much, then doubled the dose, same thing. Only thing I‚Äôd feel was jitters if I dare to have coffee. 

I switched to lisdexamfetamine 30mg, I was still fidgeting all the time, and wasted a lot of time, but I noticed I was more productive at the gym and less eager to finish my workout ASAP. Maybe also less social anxiety. But overall still not really motivated to do much. I also noticed having a little coffee on it didn‚Äôt really give me the jitters. I skipped it one day and was super drowsy so I guess it was doing something but very subtle. 

My dr then increased the dosage to 40mg and now I‚Äôm on it for the first day and I feel hyper-alert. Like I took 10 shots of espresso minus the jitters. Like I am just very very awake. It‚Äôs almost too awake, like something definitely feels different than my usual. I have sleep issues because of my active brain so I forgot what not being tired feels like. This is what it feels like. I can‚Äôt remember the last time someone would‚Äôve asked me if I‚Äôm tired and I would‚Äôve answered no, but now I would. But otherwise, I am also not focused? Not motivated? Just awake sitting on the couch for hours contemplating the feeling. Is this what it‚Äôs supposed to feel like? Is this normal? Should I force myself to get up and try to do something and see what it feels like? How do I know if the meds are working/not working? 

My next follow up with the psychiatrist is in 2 weeks but if anything I just said sounds off, I‚Äôd appreciate the insight to either give me some guidance to make the most of testing this dose, or reach out to the psychiatrist sooner. I just really need some more empirical insight because I‚Äôm starting to feel like either a junkie for how much I don‚Äôt feel much, or a fake ADHD.
