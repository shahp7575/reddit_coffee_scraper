I was fired from my job working on the phones. The phone system stopped working normally on their laptop. So I wasn't notified that a call came in nor could I hear the caller. The caller also didn't disconnect the call so they were on the call for 10 minutes at least that is what the person monitoring the call told me. During the time the caller was connected I spilled some coffee and said something along the line of ""oh sh*t."" They fired me for it. I've been working in call center for years and never had that happen.  Since then I have sent out quite a number of resumes with barely a nibble. It appears that no one is hiring at the moment.

1juvrac,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1juvrac/test_of_obedience/,Test of obedience,"I went to lunch with my wife (fairly nuanced) and dad (super TBM) today. When the waiter brought ours drinks (Diet Coke), my dad made a joke to my wife about how “back in the day, some considered caffeine to be against the word of wisdom”. I chimed in, and calmly stated how the WOW seems to be very arbitrary, and weirdly specific in mentioning coffee and tea (though not explicitly mentioned). I said IF the WOW is supposed to be lived in the “spirit of the law”, then eating healthy foods, working out, and overall making good health decisions should be “living the WOW”, even it includes drinking coffee (which “God” made via the coffee bean). However, if a TBM eats junk food, drinks energy drinks all day, doesn’t work out, is morbidly obese, eats all the meat they want, but abstains from coffee, tea, and alcohol, then they are “worthy” to enter the temple, and hence God’s presence. 

My reasoning must have been too much for my dad, as he got flustered and told me I shouldn’t let any of that bother me, and that I am thinking too much. He said the WOW is about obedience, and if we cannot be obedient in simple things like coffee and tea, then we cannot be worthy to be with God. 

My reply was that “one would have to believe in the church first in order to want to be obedient to the WOW” 

Conversation ended and my wife later told me it was awkward.  🫤

""The Buzzard, the Baldie, and the Barefoot Arrival 




Chapter One: The Arrival 
There was something unnatural about the sixth floor of Hangul Apartments. The lights flickered just a beat too long before stabilizing. The elevator made a sighing sound, as if resentful of being summoned. And then there was the couple in unit 6706—The Buzzard and The Baldie, unofficial rulers of the building’s unspoken law.

Buzzard—real name Byun Dae-sik—was a retired policeman who never quite retired from policing. He patrolled the hallways with a limp walkie-talkie, took photos of improperly parked bicycles, and once ticketed a delivery boy using a homemade citation. His neck was always craned forward like he was about to peck something. Or someone.

The Baldie—once known as Madame Eun-hee in her kitchen prime—had the piercing stare of a bald eagle and the mouth of a bitter Yelp reviewer. She’d once cooked for government officials, before a pregnancy, a cheating husband, and a missed opportunity at culinary stardom hardened her into the passive-aggressive vigilante she’d become.

Then came The Foreigner.

He moved into the apartment directly above them—a quiet man with a strange name they refused to pronounce. He walked softly, spoke rarely, and typed... enthusiastically. That, of course, was his first mistake.

The war began with subtleties. A ding-dong chime echoing from the ceiling at 6:13 a.m., sharp. A low humming sound, like a haunted air conditioner, that began exactly when he typed. Sometimes, he would hear soft, indecipherable murmurs through the walls—like a Bluetooth ghost giving orders.

He endured it. For a while.

Until one night, after staying up till 4 a.m. grading papers and nursing instant coffee, he awoke to a synthetic ding-dong-ding that wasn’t his phone.

He stepped into the living room and paused. That sound again. That fake air-con hum. It was back.

So he danced.

Barefoot. On hardwood.

He slammed his feet to a rhythm no one could follow. A jig of fury. An Irish stomp of vengeance. He twirled. He pounded. He cracked open a tin can filled with coins, shook it like maracas from hell, and howled a melody that made Buzzard knock three times from below—his version of a ceasefire request.

But the Foreigner wasn't done. Not yet.

1juvmcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PantheonMMO/comments/1juvmcm/pvp_review_from_a_long_time_pvper/,PvP Review from a long time PvPer,"So a bit of a background first. I have a pretty extensive background in MMO PvP. From small scale, to massive scale fights. From open world to instanced. I ran a large guild in Archage, Black Desert, and GW2 that competed at a server level with top tier guilds. This isn't to brag, but to at least show my perspective on Pantheons existing PVP since release.

**The Good:**  
\- **It's fun:** It really is fun, when you have two guilds vying for control of an area of the map, and being able to push out other guilds camp farming. KOS lists being added in discord. Running into a rival guild alone and getting that ""oh shit I'm so screwed"" fear.  
\- **Its freeing:** It creates a new angle in the game. While some don't probably agree with the loot/currency dropping, it creates content to enjoy for those who want rewards from pvp effort. Its rare to find a game that properly rewards pvp effort in open world.  
\- **Class Variety:** Bit of a double edged blade here. But it allows some of the classes that maybe didn't accelerate as high solo in PvE or group play. And provided an outlet to shine.  


**The Bad:**  
\- **Crafting:** Becomes way too risky at the moment. If you're trying to craft without a group, odds are you're going to get instantly killed by a rogue or wizard hiding in the shadows. I've lost quite a few inventories of leather trying to get pieces built. So you have to accept you're going to lose stuff during this process. It doesn't feel great.  
\- **Bank Camping:** Kinda ties into the above. But people sitting around the bank waiting for someone to walk in or out assuming they just brought stuff to the bank or took stuff out of the bank.   
\- **No Actual Safe Zone:** There is zero safety. PvP needs at minimum a safe area. All time full on PvP makes it too difficult to navigate the more passive (not farming) content of the game.   
\- **Class Variety:** The other side of the same blade. Rogues, Wizards with true invis, will just absolutely annihilate 1v1 if they get the jump on someone. Since invis can't be detected at the moment, it puts every non invis class at a massive disadvantage. I get it, we probably wont see balancing of classes. But I think there are options we could explore for other classes to be able to counter the invis.  


**Summarized analysis:** It's not in a healthy spot right now. As someone who adores open world risky pvp, the way its currently implemented just won't work. You HAVE to create a safety net for people to at a minimum explore the content of a city without significant risk. This means banking, crafting, trading, sitting afk to get another coffee. Archeage had safety zones around respawns, certain zones, housing, and cities. Black Desert had guards and a full karma system, but you also didnt lose loot so the risk didn't ever make sense to really camp people in towns. DAOC had dedicated pvp zones and battlegrounds. You can very easily maintain GvG fights in the open world, and also allow players to have a safe spot to run home to after surviving in the wild. Bank slots are just too few to try to rush a bank, cram it all in, then tiptoe around with the minimum possible to craft. 

TLDR: It has so much potential to be a blast. But atm its in poor shape and needs love. I hope to see the dev team address some of this seeing as they pushed PvP out so fast in front of other major content desires from the community.",2,1744166730.0,PantheonMMO,3,0.75,False

I've been working in retail for a few years now, so I'm not new to how things are... but that doesn't make me feel any better. I've been followed into my job, I've been followed while working, I've been caught after clocking out ""just to talk."" and I've been followed to my car. Why are people so weird? I do my best not to get anxious about it, I go out o walks to calm my nerves because life goes on. BUT GOD.

At my last job I had to report my manager for insinuating he wanted to sleep with me, he literally followed me into a not busy part of the store and made a ""joke"" about how he'd love some company that night. Then *today* I talk with my older male coworker (simple greeting as I had just clocked in, he told me about something regarding his health and I wished him well) TELL ME WHY he then asks me out for coffee???? Then immediately tries to back peddle as soon as I show discomfort. I'm very babyfaced and while 23 I'm not into 60+ year old men wanting to get close to me. Like please, just leave me alone.

I'd report him, but it was only one comment... though I saw the signs as he's been trying to make more conversation lately... I still won't. I've already reported two customers for being weird, I'd hate for my credibility to be ruined or for me to be seen as ""dramatic."" I know that shouldn't be the case, because if I'm uncomfortable about someone's romantic/sexual advances- I should feel safe in telling someone about it. But I don't. Again, I've only been at this current job for a few months, and I don't want my managers to see me as someone who's dramatic. I'm a hard worker, as kind and pleasant as I can be, I cherish my reputation as it often is what people are drawn to before they appreciate me for my personality. So I don't know... if he does anything big then I'll report him.

Long-time lurker here. I just finished my CompTIA gauntlet (A+, Net+, Sec+, CySA+, Pentest+, CASP+) and wanted to share something that literally saved my sanity during this process.

As someone with ADHD, staring at the mountain of dry technical content was absolute torture. My brain would constantly zone out, I'd read the same paragraph five times, and I felt like I was getting nowhere despite the hours put in.

**The game-changer?(lol) Turning the whole thing into an actual game.**

Here's how I gamified my cert studies:

# 1. Experience Points System

I created a simple XP system where:

* Each practice question = 1 XP
* Each correct answer = 3 XP
* Each hour of study = 10 XP
* Each practice test completed = 50 XP

I tracked this in a simple spreadsheet and set ""levels"" for myself (Level 1 = 100 XP, Level 2 = 250 XP, etc.) with rewards at each level. The constant progression gave my brain that dopamine hit it needed.

# 2. Achievement Unlocks

I created ""achievements"" for myself like:

* ""Perfect Section"" - Score 100% on a practice test section
* ""Marathon"" - Study for 3 hours straight
* ""Comeback Kid"" - Improve a weak domain score by 20%
* ""Early Bird"" - Complete a study session before 9am

Each achievement had a small reward (a coffee shop trip, 30 minutes of guilt-free gaming, etc.)

# 3. ""Boss Fights""

I treated each major domain as a ""boss"" I needed to defeat. Before moving on to the next domain, I had to ""defeat the boss"" by scoring at least 85% on that section's questions.

# 4. Visual Progress Tracker

I printed out a visual ""map"" of my certification journey with checkpoints. Physically coloring in my progress was incredibly satisfying for my ADHD brain - made the abstract progress concrete.

# 5. Competitive Element

I found a study buddy and we competed on practice test scores, creating our own leaderboard. The social accountability was huge.

# 6. Random Rewards

I put study rewards in envelopes (ranging from ""5-minute break"" to ""order takeout tonight"") and would randomly draw one after completing study milestones. The unpredictability was motivating.

# Results

Using these methods, my study time became genuinely engaging. I found myself actually WANTING to study because the gamification hijacked my brain's reward system in a good way. I think if you enjoy video games or just struggle with staying focused, give this a try.

The system worked so well for me and am so conviced by it that I actually built a small web and iOS app purely from my passion that formalizes this approach with proper XP tracking, achievements, and 1000+ practice questions for each CompTIA cert I took-- [CertGames](https://certgames.com).  Although, you can do this on your own with just some spreadsheets and creativity.

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?

Also, if he ever comes up to me to try to ""talk"", what should I do/say? Ive completely ceased contact with the entire group.",4,1744166318.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

In more recent events, as of last year, I got mistaken for the same person (I presume). I was out with my Mom and I was going into a Smoothie King (which was across the street from a Starbucks). A lady pulled into the Smoothie King, and she asked if I was at Starbucks. I told her I wasn't at Starbucks as I don't drink coffee.

I'm a fairly new reddit user so pardon if I make any mistakes. I'm a 31 year old woman, today is my birthday in fact! :) I've been a little reflexive the last few weeks coming up to this day, just thinking about my life. All of my friends criticize the way I eat, one of them got as far as to say I have an ED. My father is insufferable about it. Can you give me an outsider's perspective?

Let me preface this by saying that just like most women, I've spent large chunks of my life trying to prevent my perfectly normal body to grow. Just dieting, that is. Diet culture. I was born in the 90s, so that meant magazines with Drew Barrymore in low waist jeans on the cover. I'll not go into all and each of the stupid s\*\* I did to stay thin, but I don't even think I went farther than the average teenage girl tbh. The last few years of my life, my body and mind seem to have found peace with each other when I stay away from carbohydrates and I eat very, very lean. And the thing is, I just don't eat much. There's not much to say, usually I make two meals. I'll have an egg sandwich with coffee for 'brunch', I eat some chocolate as desert sometimes. At night I'll have a proper meal. Chicken fillet, whole grain rice and some lettuce are my favorite. This is easy for me because I can eat fresh, healthy food without cooking too much. I don't care at all for fruits, but I do force myself to eat one at least twice in one week. I will concede that I have flaws and I can imagine that a nutritionist would be appalled, but if I'm not passing out (I feel just fine, in fact), am I really dying like it seems to be suggested? I'm a small woman and a little pale, so I don't know, you might not think of vitality when you look at me. Sure won't find me running a marathon anytime soon. But if I don't feel hungry do I need to eat? Isn't intermittent fasting a thing? Those guys eat just like I do!

I've been taking vitamin suplements and iron tablets also.

It demands patience, precision, and a kind of reverence.

It takes more than good beans and a clever hand

to conjure something worth remembering.

And even then, what’s good is never truly good—

only good for *you*.

  


A perfect cup offered to another

might fall flat on an unready tongue.

For to love coffee is to know yourself—

your longings, your leanings,

your taste for brightness or depth,

sweetness or smoke.

It’s not enough to sip and nod.

You must want to taste,

to listen to the cup,

to hear its story,

to recognize the journey from cherry, to roast, to ritual.

A cup of coffee, then,

is never just a cup.

It is the echo of hands that grew it,

of choices made in heat and grind,

of mornings spent chasing nuance.

It is a pursuit—quiet, endless, and deliberate.

A calling to return, refine, rediscover.

Not perfection, but presence;

Not excellence, but essence;

Not mastery, but meaning.

It is memory.

It is discovery.

It is the art of arriving—

again and again—at something both fleeting and profound.",0,1744166081.0,pourover,1,0.29,False
1juvejm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1juvejm/disappearer/,Disappearer,"Need to vent a little. I saw a guy on/off casually for about a year, it was nice although neither of us wanted a relationship. He recently moved back to his home country/city which I was visiting about 6 months ago. A month or so before I went I messaged him and he said he was excited to me to visit and we should meet up/hang out. I was looking forward to seeing him but then when I arrived my messages wouldn't deliver, I thought maybe he had blocked me? I was a little disappointed but whatever. 

Fast forward a couple months and I receive a messag out of the blue like 'hey when are you visiting??'. I replied  saying I had already, and he seemed confused and like he genuinely didn't understand why my messages delivered and it was all a mistake. He apologised and even gave me other socials etc ''in case it happened again'. Anyway about a month ago I was in his city again, and this time we planned to meet and he even kept checking in about when I was supposed to arrive. 

We met for coffee - it was quite fleeting but very nice (I thought) and we said we would meet again in the coming days. Then in the midst of arranging that, he stopped replying completely. My messages delivered this time, and I even sent a double message just saying bye and that I was leaving the city, no reply. 

I guess it's just my pride but I don't really get it. Now I'm thinking maybe he did genuinely block me that first time? When we met for coffee he did explain to me that he was looking for a relationship now and dating seriously. So I don't know if that has something to do with it. But I can't help but feel a bit annoyed, we're both adults I don't know what could be the issue with communicating? Especially since we did see eachother for a little bit and have an existing relationship and, I thought, mutual respect. Were not in a relationship or anything, it would have been fine for him to tell me he doesn't feel like meeting again. But to hype up me coming and meeting and doing things and then disappear is...strange. Or maybe it's not that strange and just some rendition of good old ghosting.

I am anticipating him popping up again at some point, as he usually does that, probably when he's in my city again. If and when he does I'll expect an explanation. If he doesn't it's probably for the best. ",1,1744166034.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Denali 45L backpack
Nature hike cloud up 2 tent 
Home made pillow which is a stuff sack with memory foam in it
Neve waratah -2deg quilt
Nemo tensor all season reg wide mat - the mat and the quilt were where I dropped the most money, but I'm a grown up now and I'd like to be comfy, plus wanted gear I can use year round

Jetboil stove (a gift that gave me the idea to buy everything else)
Katadyn be free 1l plus 2 spare 1l bottles
7 dehydrated meals I made at home (oatmeal breakfasts, bean and veg chilli, lentil dal with broccoli)
Museli bars,mi goreng, dried fruit
Coffee teabags
A spoon 

Nothing special in the clothing department - some long sleeves to sleep in and for sun protection, shorts, trail run shoes that I regularly run in, sunnies and a hat. Kathmandu puffer jacket

Toothbrush, panadol, bandaids, 80% deet, compression bandage, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, soap, tp.

Camera, kindle, earbuds, lighter, 2g of quality cannabis, papers.

All up the bag weighs 10kg without water, pretty happy with that but I know I could cut down weight with a better tent and backpack, and lightweight clothes. Anything I forgot?

Detective Gary Garcia examined the body suspended over the bed. It was cut into layers, like a matryoshka doll that opened longways instead of in the middle. The only thing untouched by the killer’s knife was the respiratory system, which was partly encased in a plastic shell.

Detective Garcia’s partner, Luke Lee, observed the body with professional detachment.

“It looks…” began Lee.

*Like art*, finished detective Garcia in his head. The sliced layers were suspended perfectly by wire so they lay over each other to create a seamless impression of the body pre-cut. The victim had been beautiful in life, and the killer had allowed her to remain so in death. The topmost layer, which held her face, looked serene, and the particular care and preservation in the chest area made it look as if she could still be breathing, softly, *Like a lover in repose.*

And then there was the rest.

The layers of exposed viscera. It evoked something in Garcia, that’s how he knew it was art. *The contrast*. The beautiful with the ugly. The face and the person, with the clockwork and biological machinery, exposed for all to see.

“It looks… ,” said Lee, finishing his thought, “ …like there’s webbing between the layers.”

Garcia looked over the corpse again.

“You mean the wires holding the layers  up?” asked Garcia, pointing at a translucent wire that held up the back of the victim’s foot, going up through several bones, and exiting out of one of the middle toes.

“No,” said Lee, pointing at the empty space between the layers.

Garcia tilted his head, and caught something in the light.

“I see it,” said Garcia.

Between each layer was a fine webbing, finer than spider’s silk.

“Good eye,” said Garcia. Even after a decade of working together, he was still amazed by Lee’s powers of perception. “I know it exists and I can still barely see it, how did you spot it in the first place? More importantly, what do you think it is?”

The thin detective Luke Lee scratched his scruff.

“I don’t know…” he said. “Maybe… no that’s dumb…”

“Out with it,” said the burlier Garcia. “What’s  your gut telling you?”

“I don’t know what it is, but… if I didn’t know any better, I’d say they were veins.”

Garcia tilted his head, and tried to catch more of the fine network of silk-like fibers. There was, he admitted, a sort of method to the seemingly random nature of them. They seemed concentrated most around the inner organs, and between the layers of skin. Now that he saw that they essentially connected everything together, he wondered how he missed them at all. Indeed, they seemed to be connecting the disparate parts of the victim.

“Fuck me,” said Garcia. “They do look like veins.”

“They can’t be though,” said Lee.

“Or could they? Let’s see what the lab boys have to say.”

Garcia called for a member of the forensics team and asked for a set of glass slides. He pinched a section of the fibers between them, handing them back to the forensics member, asking him and his team to find out what the fibers were. The forensics member took the sample, and rejoined his team.

“What do we think for time of death?” asked Lee, preparing an onsite autopsy form.

Garcia looked at his partner, and then at the body. *Time of death?* It was surprisingly difficult to say. The victim’s family had said that she had stopped responding to texts and messages approximately three days ago, after a night out with friends. The victim went radio silent for the rest of the weekend. They hadn’t thought it was too unusual until a relative that worked in the same office as the victim noticed that she had failed to show up for work on monday without so much as a sick call. That’s when alarm bells started going off. The family asked for a wellness check that morning, and what the police officer found in the victim’s apartment was what led to Lee and Garcia being called in. That left a window of nearly seventy-two full hours. Enough time for advanced signs of decomposition to begin to set in, especially as it was the middle of summer. However, as it was, the body had not even begun to smell. Which didn’t make sense. The butchery– though Garcia struggled to think of it as that –of the body would have taken hours alone. Plenty of time for decomposition to set in.

“Put it down as indeterminable,” said Garcia.

“Hmm,” hummed Lee.

“You don’t agree?” asked Garcia, turning to his partner, seeing his eyes narrowed in concentration.

“It’s not that I *disagree*,” said his partner. “I just have a thought is all. It’s the middle of summer.”

“Right.”

“There’s no detectable odor.”

“Right again.”

“And in this heat there would have been in a matter of hours. And look here.”

Lee pointed at the seams of the victim’s skin, where the two largest halves of the matryoshka-like cuts would have met. There was scabbing. *Signs of healing*.

Garcia was struck dumb.

“There’s no way,” said Garcia. “There’s really no way. That would mean…”

“She could have been alive this morning…”

“In this state? Impossible. Unless you’re saying the killer somehow sliced her up and strung her up like this in minutes, a half hour tops before the officer who came to check on her stopped by… no there’s no way.”

“I’m just saying, it looks like she was alive until *very* recently.”

Garcia just shook his head.

“There’s something else,” said Lee. “Squint your eyes, and look at the body. Tell me what you see. Or rather, tell me what you don’t.”

Garcia arched an eyebrow at his partner, then did as he asked. He squinted his eyes and then looked at the body. He didn’t see anything. But of course, he realized, that’s exactly what Lee was getting at.

You see there was a classic trick that detectives and members of forensics pulled when examining a body. Squinting at it to better distinct the different hues of it, to see where the blood had pooled. Even in deaths caused by heavy blood loss the remaining blood would noticeably pool within the body. As it happened, there was no pooled blood in the victim’s body, and the corpse lacked that distinct paleness that came with a body purposefully drained, as they sometimes were, like pigs.

“Shit,” said Garcia. “She’s fresh. *Really* fresh.”

Lee nodded.

“Not enough time for the blood to pool even,” he said. “What do you want me to jot down for time of death then?”

“Put it down for early this morning,” said Garcia, not able to believe what he was saying, or seeing.

Lee nodded again, writing their conclusion on the form. He then tapped his pen on the next line of the form.

“Apparent cause of death?” he asked Garcia.

“Indeterminable,” said Garcia– which was comical looking at the state of the victim, but if she had been alive this morning, then, miraculously, it hadn’t been the cutting that killed her.

This time Lee didn’t disagree. Until a proper autopsy was performed, there would be no official cause of death.

With the onsite autopsy done, Garcia took in the body again. He had trouble tearing his eyes away from it. The body– the woman –was both grotesque and horrendously beautiful. The way the top layer of her rested seamlessly on top of the rest, so that her pale, almost luminescent breasts, shone beneath the gray overcast light of day. The killer had strung her up over her bed and left the window open. It was a wonder that no one from the apartment complex across the street had seen her– it was a tall building –Garcia imagined at a certain floor someone would have had the perfect view of her.

Garcia’s pulse quickened, suddenly he noticed his partner staring at him, and realized that he had been entranced with the body for too long. He tried to think of an excuse as to why, but couldn’t think of anything. It was in the middle of this panicked thinking, that someone came up to talk to the detectives.

“Excuse me, detectives,” said the same member of forensics that was helping them earlier. “We’re just about packing up now, wanted to let you know in case you needed anything else from us before we go.”

“We don’t need anything else at this time,” said Garcia. “Did you find anything interesting? Something to point us in the right direction?”

The forensics member nodded his head.

“Yes, we were able to reasonably conclude that there was no sign of forced entry.”

“So it was someone she knew?” said Lee, turning to Garcia.

“Probably. Almost always is,” commented Garcia.

Garcia and Lee left soon after, with Garcia taking the body in one final time before he closed the door. It left him with an ugly feeling. He felt a wave of nauseating revulsion toward himself.

Garcia was still thinking about the body hours later, when he and Lee were at their desks, making phone calls, arranging interviews, waiting for the body boys to give them a cause of death. At some point, in between calls, a member of forensics dropped off a manila envelope with pictures of the scene in it. Garcia opened the envelope out of instinct, rote and mechanical. If he had been thinking, or been aware of what he was doing, he might not have decided to open it, because he would have been afraid of exactly what happened. And what happened is that he became transfixed.

Garcia hadn’t stopped thinking about the body. It lingered on in the back of his mind, even as he spoke to the victims family and friends to arrange interviews, all he could think about was how beautiful she had appeared hanging over her bed. *Like a lover in repose*. So when he laid eyes on the scene of the crime once again he became re-enamored with the body. He could almost imagine the victim’s chest rising and falling, serenely luminescent, like moonlit marble. It was almost enough to send his heart aflutter.

*You’re sick*, he thought*, real fucken sick*.

“What do you see?” asked Lee from behind Gracia shoulder, causing him to jump inside his skin.

Garcia hoped he didn’t look like he needed new pants. He also smelled coffee, and sure enough when he turned his seat, he saw that Lee had a piping hot cup of probably old coffee from the precinct pot.

“It’s nothing,” said Garcia, not wanting to say what he was thinking out loud.

“It’s not nothing,” said his partner. “It’s something, a big something. I’m sure of it.”

“It really isn’t.”

His partner sighed, and leaned on his desk.

“Gary,” he said, full stop. “We’ve been partners for how long? I can’t even remember–” *Ten years, but who’s counting?*. “ –You have a way of getting into those sickos’s heads.”

*Because I am one of those Sickos,* he thought.

“What’s your point?” asked Garcia.

“My point is you got that anxious look on your face. The one that shows up when you really get in a killer’s head.”

Garcia took another look at the photo in his hands. The wires holding her up didn’t show on the photo, so it looked like she was floating.

“It almost looks like she’s breathing… like… a woman you just slept with, y’know, someone beside you. The way the body was arranged… I think that was intentional, like the killer, in their own fucked up way, had been in love with her.”

Lee considered the photo and then shot a sideways glance at Garcia. For a quick, and yet still too long second, Garcia agonized over what Lee would say. A second longer, and Garcia broke the silence himself.

“It’s art,” he said, quick;y adding “in a fucked up kind of way, I think that’s what the killer was going for.”

Lee nodded, seeming to consider Garcia’s statement. Then, after taking a sip of his coffee, started them on a new track of thought.

“Circling back to possible suspects. Forensics says there was no sign of forced entry, meaning it was probably someone she knew. Rolling with your interpretation of the state of the victim, wouldn’t it be likely that it was a boyfriend or lover?”

Garcia touched his nose to his steepled hands.

“Interviews are already set up. We’ll ask about a boyfriend then,” said Garcia. “Any news from the body boys about the fibers? Or anything at all?”

“Nope. They weren’t able to identify the fibers. They’re sending them to a specialist. They think they might have a cause of death already, but they didn’t want to say what they think it might be, they want to rule out a few things first.”

“Did they say why?”

“Some of their ideas were ‘outlandish’,” said Lee. “Their words, not mine.”

Garcia let out a noise that was somewhere between a snort, a chuckle, and a grunt. *It’s an outlandish case!*

A few days and several interviews later they had come up short. Not only had the victim not had a boyfriend at the time of death, she had reportedly, according to her family and close co-workers, identified as both asexual, and aromantic, never having had a romantic partner in her entire life. That wasn’t a death knell per se, but it killed the one thing that Garcia and Lee had resembling a lead in the case, especially as interviewing the victim’s inner, and even outer, circle had yielded no other possible suspects. The friends she’d been out with on the weekend that she disappeared had perfect alibis, corroborated by their phone activity.

The case stalled for a matter of weeks. In that time the body had been taken, and prepared for a closed casket. The fibers still hadn’t been identified, probably they hadn’t been looked at yet, specialists of any kind that help the police always had more on their plate than they could handle, so it could be some time before they heard anything back at all. But they had heard back from the body boys. Garcia had been glad to finally have the report, but when Lee read it for the both of them, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“You’re shitting me,” Garcia had said.

“I wish I were, but that’s what the file says,” Lee had said, holding a large envelope with the body boy’s report.

The cause of death? Dehydration.

“Shock, blood loss, organ failure, anything that would have made *sense*,” said Garcia. “You’re sure you heard them right Lee?”

Lee only nodded.

Later, when Garcia was at his desk reflecting on the strange case, he was once again gazing into the photograph of the victim. She hung there in the picture, beautifully, ethereally. Was she the first? Were there others? Was she the last and only? That last thought shot a queasy dread up his spine, and he had to ask himself an uncomfortable question, or rather, the uncomfortable question arose but he did not ask it. He was scared of the answer.

Suddenly, a voice called to him from a distant elsewhere that Garcia was surprised to find that he inhabited as well.

“Another body was found,” said the voice of his partner.

A pulse of exhilaration went up Garcia’s spine, quickly followed by a wave of disgust, mostly at himself. They had a number of cases open, that’s just police work, but Garcia knew which case his partner was referring to.

“Let’s go,” he replied, and so they did.

The scene of the second killing was a studio apartment that lived up to the name. There were storyboards hanging on the wall, art, and prints. The victim, a  young man, had been stripped naked, seated at his drawing desk, appearing as a posed model, or sculpted statue. Unlike the first victim, which had been fully sectioned, the young man only had his hand dissected. Its layers pulled and revealed like a rough sketch in an anatomy book.

The young man had been wiry and skinny, but the killer had posed him in such a way as to make him appear elegant, lean instead of thin, thoughtful instead of lost. Like the first victim there was a certain beauty to the young man, an elegance that was only rivaled by drawings which piled dotted the sheets of paper on his desk, and on the floor. Piles and piles of drawings. They were naturalistic drawings, of people, animals, and plants, they seemed realer than real, capturing the very essence of the subject. Each drawing was small, as if the artist had had a limited range of motion, and indeed, looking at the dissected hand, if the killer had preserved the artist’s ability to draw, then it would have not been able to move very much, especially considering the ad hoc pine architecture that had been placed to hold the hand and its layers up.

Still taking in the sight, Garcia wondered if “young” was the right word for the man. The spartan like decoration– that is to say, lack thereof –in the apartment, and the build of the man, had given Garcia the impression of youth, but looking closer at the body he wasn’t sure. The man had deep wrinkles in some places, like his skin had shriveled up, and deep crows feet around his eyes as well.

Lee, who had also been examining the body, made a clicking sound with his tongue, and turned away from it.

“What is it?” asked Garcia.

“The victim, he died of dehydration, I’m sure of it,” said Lee. He turned so he was facing Garcia again. “The wrinkles around the victim’s eyes aren’t crows feet, nor I suspect, will we find that the victim was all that old. All those wrinkles are signs of his body thirsting for water. Right now it’s just speculation, but if it’s the same killer as the woman hung over he bed, I’d bet good money that the monster who did what they did to the sleeping woman, was also responsible for what happened to this man. And look.” Garcia fished out a slide from his pocket, seemingly capturing empty air between the layers of the dead man’s hands. Garcia watched this with some amount of curiosity, though he suspected he knew what his partner was about to show him.

Lee closed the slide with a small band, and handed it to Garcia, who saw right away what it was supposed to be. In  between the slide, were the same fibers that they had found in between each layer of the first victim.

The pair of detectives went through and did a full on site examination of the body. Afterwards they aided the forensics team in scouring the small apartment for evidence, and once again found that there appeared to be no evidence of forced entry.

If the victims knew the killer, then there would be a link between the two, so it looked like another round of interviews for Garcia and Lee with the first victims friends and family, as well as whoever they could speak to concerning the second victim. This is how they spent the next few days. Though as it would turn out, there was no connection between the first and second victim, and it would seem that the artist had not only lived spartan, but lonely as well. He had no friends to speak of, something that Lee remarked was not uncommon in modern young men. The closest thing they had resembling to a lead after their first round of interviews came from the second victim’s mother, who mentioned that he had been excited for a lunch meeting with a client, who according to the timing, might have been the last person to see the artist alive.

Lee and Garcia arranged to meet with the client, whose name they found through the artist's social media pages. He had been commissioned by a commercial lab named Plant Projects, and had met with one of their scientists over lunch to discuss the work they wanted for him.

“Sounds like something they could have done over email,” said Garcia.

“That’s how those business types are,” said Lee as they entered the lab’s building. “Meetings, meetings… meetings.”

The inside of the building, the parts after the front desk and first hallway, were a hot humid environment that were lit mostly with UV lights.

Hunkering in the dank dungeon of UV light were people in lab coats snipping at, brushing, and measuring– in one way or another –plants. The only person in a lab coat not attending to any plants, or to anything really, was the person they were there to interview. He was sitting at a table that appeared to have been cleared away for them to meet at. On his breast was a metal name badge that read: *Director of Mycology, Anthony Okawa*.

“Good evening Mr. Okawa. I’m detective Gary Garcia, and this is my partner.”

“Luke Lee,” said his partner.

“Good evening,” said Okawa, with practiced courteousness.

“As I’m sure you’ve been told, we were made aware that you were the last person to see a certain artist alive, and were hoping to ask you any questions regarding how he appeared when you saw him.”

“Oh my,” said Okawa, open mouthed, gawking at the detectives. Like his courteousness, there was a practiced, performative air to his exasperation.

“I’m sorry, were you close?” asked Garcia, with a cocked eyebrow. He found Okawa’s open mouthed shock to be a bit much.

“No, not particularly, but I did just see him alive only last week. I’m not sure *how* I feel. I didn’t know him, but I saw him, talked to him, ate with him. And now you tell me he’s dead. It's just… it’s shocking I suppose.”

Something about Okawa’s answer felt off to Garcia, though he couldn’t say why.

“I see,” said Garcia, still wondering what was so unsettling about Okawa. “Do you mind if we start with the questions?”

“Of course, go ahead, have a seat.”

Garcia and Lee took a seat opposite of Okawa on the empty workspace.

Garcia started them off.

“Just for the sake of record, the victim was working for you, correct?”

“Not for *me* exactly, but for the company I work with, I was just the one that hashed out the details with him regarding his work.”

“And what was that work exactly?”

“Drawings, for some of our new crossbreeds. Artistic renditions can be better for accentuating unique characteristics that may not be as prominent in photos.”

“Did you know the victim before he was commissioned for your company’s work?”

“Yes and no. I knew of him from an art profile I saw online. I was a fan of his work and so it was me who recommended him for the job. His ability to capture nature in his art was quite amazing. Perchance did you have an opportunity to see his work?” Here Okawa began to talk with his hands. That’s when Garcia understood what had unsettled him before. That moment, where Okawa began to talk with his hands, that wasn’t an act, but the moments leading up to it were, a very practiced one. Okawa was the kind of man that always wore a mask, even in the most mundane situations.

“We did,” said Garcia. “It was indeed impressive work.”

“I’m glad you think so. Yes, so, I was a fan, then I met him, and now he’s dead, it’s… a bit much. I’m not sure how I should feel.”

“That’s fair,” said Garcia. “As far as your last meeting with him, was this another discussion about his commission over lunch?”

“Technically speaking yes, though most of the details had already been hashed out. I’m embarrassed to admit it was mostly so I could spend more time with him. As I said I was a huge fan.”

Garcia laughed with a grunt.

“Did the victim seem off to you in your last meeting? Did he seem anxious or worried?”

Okawa seemed to search the detective’s faces.

“No detectives, he didn't appear overly anxious to me, or scared. He seemed perfectly normal.”

“I see, thank you,” said Garcia, preparing to write something down. “Around when did your lunch with Thomas begin and end?”

Okawa put a hand to his chin.

“It’s okay if you don’t remember exactly,” said Garcia. “A rough time will do.”

“Hmm,” hummed Okawa. “Sometimes around noon, and I kept him probably longer than I should have, possibly until around one or just after.”

Garcia wrote the time down for the sake of good record keeping, and shot a glance at his partner.

“I don’t have any further questions. Lee?”

“Just the one,” said Lee, stone faced.

“By all means detective,” said Okawa.

“What is it you do here?”

Okawa seemed genuinely perplexed by the question.

“As I mentioned I’m really more of an assistant for the folks here who work on the plants. It’s not very exciting,” said Okawa.

“Yes, I’m sure,” said Lee. “But just humour us.”

Okawa cleared his throat, and looked at Garcia, as if to say *“can you believe this man?”*. Garcia for one, enjoyed watching his partner work.

“What? you want me to tell you about my morning routine?”

“If you have to, to get to the exact details of your work.”

Okawa grinned, letting out a stifled chuckle.

“The work I do here isn’t something I can talk about with just anyone.” Okawa cleared his throat. “If that’s all detectives I should get back to helping the other researchers.”

“Thank you for your time,” said Lee, shaking the man’s hands.

Garcia and Lee said farewell to the scientist. Garcia began to leave, but noticed that Lee had not yet begun to move. The energy after the farewell grew somewhat awkward, and that’s when Okawa suddenly realized that he had to go to a different part of the building. Only when Okawa had left, did Lee turn to leave with his partner. Garcia was just about to ask why Lee had suddenly decided to ask Okawa about his work, when Lee stopped to ask a pair of scientists they passed the same question.

“What are you guys doing there?” asked Lee as he and Garcia passed by a working pair of scientists.

The scientists were a male and female pair. They smiled at each before replying.

“We’re working on increasing the growth rates of a new superfood we’re developing. Can’t say much more than that.”

“Hm, very interesting,” said Lee, nodding. “Say do you know what Okawa works on specifically?”

The female scientist spoke up first.

“He helps us with some of the stop gaps in our research, namely addressing our plant’s abilities to take in nutrients from the ground. I thought it was going well, but he cleared out his experiments from the table top earlier, must be prepping a new batch.”

“Actually he just wanted to give his mycelium some darkness,” said the male. “I saw him moving stuff around and asked why. I didn’t know mycelium needed darkness, but hey, I’m not the fungus guy.”

“Huh,” said the female scientist.

“I'm sorry,” said Lee, “mycelium?”

“It’s how he’s helping our plants absorb nutrients out of the ground faster,” said the female scientist. “They act sort of like veins that suck up nutrients from the dirt.”

“That is very interesting,” said Lee, smiling.

“We could say more, but you should probably ask Okawa, he loves talking about his fungus.”

“I see,” said Lee, shooting a glance at Garcia who was half in half out of the lab.

Lee smiled and bid the pair farewell, joining Garcia who was hallway out to the hallway waiting for him. “One last question, were you two here when Okawa went out to lunch with that artist?”

“The one we hired to do the sketches for our journal submission, yeah, Okawa was stoked. Apparently we hired him on his rec.”

“Around what time would you say he got back?”

“Oh, we lost him for the day, didn’t come back to the lab until the day after,” the scientist shook his head and smiled.

“Very interesting,” said Lee, “Thanks for the information, you two have a nice day.”

Lee turned away from the pair, and joined Garcia in the hallway outside the lab.

“Partner?” asked Garcia.

“What?”

“What was that about? With the pair just now?”

“Following a bit of intuition,” said Lee as they walked through the long hallway, gazing into the middle distance.

“Alright what did you see?”

“I’m not sure. Probably nothing.”

“Spill,” grunted Garcia, “I’m curious now, plain and simple.”

Lee let out a bit of air from his nostrils, and it was something like a huff and a laugh.

“His desk,” said Lee, adding nothing else.

“What about it?”

“His desk was empty, unlike the other workstations in the lab. That’s assuming it was a workstation, and that it was his. I was planning on asking the pair, but they told me without me having to ask. He was also dodging the question about his work. Work he said was too sensitive to mention at all, and yet the pair just now didn’t seem to think much about spilling the beans on that. I can’t say why, I just got a weird vibe from the guy, thought he was lying for some reason, so I asked about the lunch he had with the artist, and again. Okawa said he was out with the artist for an hour, but the pair back there said they lost him for a day. Something’s off.”

Garcia stopped and looked at his partner.

“It’s not nothing,” he said. “I got a weird feeling from him too.”

“Acting suspicious around the police isn’t anything new, nerves will do that to someone, but… this Okawa guy seems more off than that.”

“I agree,” said Garcia. “Extremely off.”

“Maybe something, maybe nothing.”

“Maybe something, yeah,” echoed Garcia. “What do you want to do?”

“I’d like to tail the guy for a bit, just for some peace of mind.”

“Alright, let's set up across the street.”

“No, Garcia, It’s just a feeling, nothing concrete, I’ll do it alone. Besides, results for those fibers were supposed to be back today. I’d like for one of us to start working on whether those fibers are relevant to the case or not.”

“Good call,” said Garcia. “I’d be lost without you deducing the world for me, partner.”

“Hmph,” let out Lee. “And I couldn’t trust my deduction without your gut instinct. If I think it, sometimes you just know it, and it puts me at ease. Later partner.”

“Heh,” let out Garcia. “Later.”

And they parted.

Once he was back at the precinct, Garcia went straight for the body boys’s office.

“Detective Garcia,” said one of the body boys, greeting him.

“Evening, Lee told me you would have something about the fibers for me today.”

The body boy he was speaking to looked at him apologetically. 

“Sorry to say, but we haven’t heard back from that specialist.”

“What?”

“They said there’d be a delay, which is weird, the Plant Projects lab usually delivers so quickly.”

“Did you say Plant Projects?” asked Garcia, surprised.

“Yeah, why?”

“I was just there.”

“Oh, no way!” said the more excitable body boy. “Why were you there?”

“I was there to talk to a guy named Anthony Okawa, he was the last person to speak to the latest victim.”

“Oh weird!” said the other, not as excitable but still fairly energetic, body boy. “He’s the guy we sent the sample to.”

“What?” said Garcia, not really asking for clarification, just announcing further surprise.

“Yeah,” said one of the body boys. “The fibers you collected looked like they might be a part of a mycelium network, very far out stuff.”

“And very unlikely,” interjected the other body boy. “It’s why we had Okawa check on the sample for us. I’m surprised he didn’t mention it to you, he knew where the sample came from, he even knew it was your case.”

“Would he have been able to give us anything? I thought you said there was a delay.”

“A delay in the information report sure,” said the body boy.

“But that's like… logistical,” said the other. “We need it for records and stuff, but he said he found out pretty quickly what it was. Where it would have come from and whatnot.”

“Well?” asked Garcia.

“Well what?” asked the body boys in unison.

“What’s the origin of those fibers, the mycelium.”

“He didn’t say,” said one.

“And we didn’t ask,” said the other. “It’d be on the report.”

“Hmm,” hummed Garcia, suddenly uneasy.

Garcia made a call to his partner, who didn’t answer, and the body boys watched, mystified at Garcia’s sudden change in demeanor when Lee didn’t pick up.",1,1744165337.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Well the Honda just died. Mechanic says it’s going to be upwards of $900 to fix. His dad is only interested if he can find a used part for cheap. Either way, we’re looking at a minimum of 7 days as a 1 car family. Most likely more. 

The current solution my husband and his parents worked out is that he will take my car to work and they will take the car seat from my car and use it to pick up/drop off my daughter every day. I will be left at home in a tiny fucking village of a backwater town with no walkable anything. I can’t go get a coffee or lunch or grocery shop. All I can do is DoorDash but I have dietary restrictions and none of the restaurants offer anything that I can eat except overpriced salads. 

I love that I’m just a shitty fucking afterthought to everyone. ",8,1744165257.0,breakingmom,5,1.0,False

At Kunts Live Forever, we don’t do “normal.” We do feral mornings, chaotic nights, and all-day energy fueled by delusion and caffeine. So naturally, we made coffee.

Not just any coffee—these are blends for the bold, the weird, the sleep-deprived artists and anti-heroes building a rebellion in their kitchens at 2:47AM.

Introducing the 4 holy brews of KLF:

🦝 1. Coon Coffee Blend
Flavor Profile: Smoky. Earthy. Slightly unpredictable.
Energy Level: “I just saw God in a parking lot.”

Inspired by the trash pandas of the night, this blend is for those who thrive in chaos and aren’t afraid to dig deep. Literally. Bold as hell, with an aftertaste of revenge and roasted dirt (in the best way).

Tagline: Brewed in the shadows. Best enjoyed on rooftops or next to a dumpster fire.

🏴☠️ 2. Pirate Brew Blend

Energy Level: “Let’s overthrow a system today.”

This blend sails straight into your bloodstream. For outlaws, renegades, and folks who wear too many rings. Don’t ask what’s in it. Just drink it, scream at the sea, and live your weird little pirate fantasy.

Tagline: No rules. No land. Just beans and anarchy.

🤘 3. Punky Kunt Origin Coffee
Flavor Profile: Single-origin badassery. Notes of citrus and defiance.
Energy Level: “I DIY’d my life and it’s somehow working.”

Tagline: Drink loud. Think louder.

😵💫 4. Rabid Racoon Blend
Flavor Profile: High-octane. Wild. Slightly foamy.
Energy Level: “I can hear colors.”

This is the nuclear option. Not for the faint of heart or the well-adjusted. One cup and you’ll be running through walls and pitching your weirdest ideas with total conviction. Made for art gremlins and chaos creatures.

Tagline: Do not consume if you plan to relax today.

☠️ WAKE THE KUNT UP

1juv4d1,https://i.redd.it/n0gw2bteypte1.jpeg,Adjusting My Workout: Pairing Kettlebells and Dumbbells for a Left Shoulder-Friendly Routine,"I’m currently working with an 8kg and a 10kg kettlebell for my double-hand swings and lifts, exercising 2-3 times per week with 10 reps for 3 sets. With my schedule easing up, I’ve been able to extend my workouts to 30-45 minutes per session. On top of that, I’m following a gradual calorie deficit plan and have swapped my lattes for either brewed coffee or matcha.

Right now, I’m following Workout with Roxanne’s April Challenge with some modifications. While the program exclusively uses 8-10kg kettlebells, I’ve chosen to use my 8kg kettlebell for two-handed moves—like chest presses and swings—and supplement it with 5lbs dumbbells for single-arm exercises and planks, since push-ups are still a challenge for me.

I attempted to perform single-arm raises and presses with the 8kg kettlebell, but my left shoulder struggled to lift properly without compensating by bending and pushing upward. To prevent injury, I’ve been using the lighter 5lbs dumbbells for now and gradually working towards progression.

After completing the April Challenge, I’m considering investing in an adjustable 15kg dumbbell (allowing for 7.5kg per side) or switching to a 6kg kettlebell.

I’d really appreciate any feedback or advice on this approach—does this setup sound effective and safe, or are there changes you’d recommend?",3,1744165131.0,kettlebell,0,1.0,False

You are TherapistGPT, a deeply attuned, trauma-informed therapist with a specialization in core wound healing. You draw from integrative traditions—including psychodynamic, somatic, cognitive, and humanistic approaches—to support inner child work, attachment repair, and self-worth recovery. You embody non-judgment, safety, and emotional presence.
</Role>

<Context>
Many people carry hidden beliefs of being unworthy, unlovable, or fundamentally flawed—beliefs rooted in early attachment ruptures or formative moments of emotional neglect. Without identifying and addressing these emotional imprints, surface-level fixes often fail to create lasting change, perpetuating cycles of pain and self-sabotage. This conversation aims to compassionately uncover and heal those deeper roots.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Structure the session as a therapeutic arc with these stages:

1. Safety & Presence: Begin by affirming the user's courage. Establish emotional safety and a secure container for vulnerable exploration.
2. Curious Inquiry: Ask open-ended, emotionally attuned questions to help bypass defenses and access early experiences of unworthiness. Explore relational patterns, somatic responses, and emotionally charged memories.
3. Wound Identification: Help the user notice and name the developmental sources of their beliefs—e.g. conditional love, emotional neglect, chronic invalidation, attachment trauma.
4. Processing & Release: Validate grief, anger, and other emotions that surface. Offer somatic awareness, psychoeducation, and inner child practices to begin integration.
5. Integration & Steps Forward: Close the session with affirming insights and personalized practices. Emphasize that healing self-worth is an ongoing, nonlinear process.

</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never reduce unworthiness to a “thought” or minimize pain with platitudes.
- Avoid spiritual bypassing or premature solutions.
- Maintain therapeutic boundaries with warmth and attunement.
- Honor cultural and emotional complexity without imposing universal frameworks.
- Recommend professional support when needed.
- Do not promise fixed outcomes or healing timelines.
</Constraints>

Respond with attuned, emotionally paced conversation using the following rhythm:
1. Reflect and validate what the user has shared
2. Offer resonant observations or gentle insights
3. Ask deepening, exploratory questions
4. Share relevant psychological framing when helpful
5. Provide personalized healing practices or reflections
Maintain warmth, curiosity, and user-led discovery throughout.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Start with : ""Please share what brings you to explore your feelings of unworthiness or not being enough today, I'm here to support your healing journey."", then wait for the user to enter their request.
</User_Input>

```

 Three Prompt Use Cases:

1. Processing childhood emotional neglect: Explore how subtle forms of emotional invalidation or parental emotional unavailability shaped your core beliefs about deserving love and attention.

2. Healing perfectionism and imposter syndrome: Uncover the specific moments where you internalized the message that your worth depends on achievement, and develop an identity based on intrinsic rather than performance-based value.

3. Recovering from relationship trauma: Examine how betrayal, abandonment or manipulation in intimate relationships reinforced earlier wounds around worthiness, and rebuild your capacity for healthy attachment.

 Sample User Input to Try:
""I've always felt like I have to achieve more to be worthy of love. Even when I succeed, I feel empty inside and immediately need the next accomplishment. I'm exhausted but can't stop proving myself.""

## Understanding Your Needs: What to Look for in an Electric Pink Kettle

Before diving into specific models,it's essential to consider your individual needs and preferences. Here's a breakdown of the key factors to keep in mind when choosing an electric pink kettle:

*   **Capacity:** How much water do you typically need to boil at once? If you frequently host guests or have a large family, a 1.7-liter pink electric kettle might be the best choice. For smaller households or individuals, a smaller option like a small pink kettle or a 1-liter model may suffice.
*   **Material:** Electric kettles come in various materials, each with it's own pros and cons. Stainless steel is durable and easy to clean, but some people are concerned about potential leaching. Glass kettles allow you to see the water level, but can be more fragile. Ceramic kettles, like the Noelle™ Pink Ceramic electric Tea Kettle, offer a classic, elegant look but may heat up slowly. Consider a pink kettle stainless steel option for durability and a sleek design.
*   **Features:** Do you need temperature control for specific types of tea? A pink kettle temperature control feature is invaluable for tea enthusiasts. Are you sensitive to noise? A pink kettle quiet boil model will minimize disruption. Other useful features include automatic shut-off, boil-dry protection, and a cordless design.*   **Boil Time:** A pink kettle fast boil feature is essential if you're always in a hurry. Look for kettles with a high wattage (e.g., 1500W) for faster heating.
*   **Price:** Electric pink kettles range in price from affordable options to high-end models like the pink kettle Smeg or pink kettle KitchenAid. Determine your budget before you start shopping. An affordable pink kettle doesn't necessarily mean sacrificing quality; many excellent options offer great value for money.
*   **Aesthetic:** Let's face it; aesthetics are a significant factor when choosing a pink kettle! Do you prefer a retro pink kettle design,a pastel pink kettle shade,a hot pink electric kettle,or a metallic pink kettle finish? Consider your overall kitchen decor and choose a kettle that complements your style. An electric kettle pink aesthetic is a great choice for those wanting a touch of joy in their kitchen.

However, I know it may not do a lot for my stress/anxiety, more focus/motivation, but this could change, some people it helps, some it doesn’t. Anyway, I don’t show my anxiety very often on the outside so ig you could consider me (high-functioning). I would consider myself healthy, workout 6 times a week, eat well, etc. Anyways, currently taking specifically for this: (more at bottom, still experiencing some anxious feelings and hard to get my heart rate down sometimes, always been a thing)

Morning:
- L-theanine 200mg (if i have a coffee, not very often because im adjusting to medication, if no coffee I’ll have it after workout in the afternoon)
- Magtein (Magnesium L-Threonate) 144mg

Afternoon:
- Shoden Ashwagandha 200mg (after morning workout)

Nighttime:
- Magnesium Glycinate: 500mg
- GABA: 250-500mg
- Sometimes chamomile tea

Anything else I could maybe add? Bacopa and 5HTP I think react with my medication, so am I doing all I can? Anything fancy these days? Trying to avoid medication as much as I can for now. It’s not debilitating anxiety, just every once in awhile it gets me good.

I hope this helps some people! 
Every place we found to stay was on booking.com, and none of them were hotels which just seemed to be the norm. If anyone wants to know where we stayed just ask! I loved all of them. We stayed near the city centers.

Arrived Friday evening in Split, wondered around, got dinner, found a cool bar, rested & planned. 

Saturday: we took a tour to Krka National Park, it was an easy & pleasant trip! Just picked one on viator. Spent the evening checking out the city.

Sunday: we got breakfast then took the ferry to 
Hvar. Super easy trip. Loved our room here (washer/dryer and beautiful balcony) We had a delicious lunch, and then walked down to the popular “beach” got a drink & enjoyed the water.

Monday: we were up kind of early so we hiked to the fortress. Then, one of our “must-dos” on our coastal vacations is a boat day, so we found a tour on viator & had a great time meeting people & swimming. It was a BYOB & food trip which was nice.

Tuesday: quick breakfast before taking the ferry to korcula. As soon as we got there we rented some bikes & rode down to Lumbarda (this is a whole story, don’t recommend riding bikes, it was way harder than they told us it would be). We visited 3 wineries, loved them all!! 

Wednesday: we took one of those hop on hop off 3 island tour things. I’m glad we had tevas this trip because every beach was rocky! But seriously the water was so beautifully clear & all the beaches were beautiful. We got dinner on the second island & lucky we did because the third had one place on it that I think was closed because of the time. 

Thursday: slow morning in korcula, then took the ferry to Dubrovnik. We didn’t really have plans this day so we decided to do a sunset kayak trip & it was actually a lot of fun (and hard!)

Friday: walked the walls early! It was still so hot! Just want to shoutout Cogito Coffee - if you’re a coffee snob, go here. We wandered all over & ended up going to lokrum island & enjoyed a quick swim there as well as some GOT sightseeing.

Saturday: breakfast, last lap around old town & then home. ",2,1744164670.0,CroatiaTravelTips,0,1.0,False

While effective, Phentermine comes with a range of potential side effects, including increased heart rate, anxiety, and high blood pressure. For individuals seeking safer, natural alternatives, Phentermine over the counter alternatives in the form of OTC diet pills are a great option.

[**Weight Loss Injection Alternatives**](https://www.wb22trk.com/XR12ZC/BP658/?uid=2344)

In this article, we will explore the best Phentermine alternatives over the counter and natural OTC diet pills that are available near you. These options offer similar benefits to Phentermine without the associated risks.

What Is Phentermine and Why Are People Looking for Alternatives?

Phentermine works by stimulating the central nervous system, leading to reduced hunger and increased energy expenditure. While effective for short-term weight loss, it can lead to side effects such as:

* Increased heart rate
* High blood pressure
* Sleep disturbances
* Nervousness

Due to these side effects, many individuals are seeking natural OTC diet pills as safer alternatives to Phentermine. These supplements contain natural ingredients that help with fat burning, appetite suppression, and energy boosting, without the prescription or potential risks associated with Phentermine.

Best Phentermine Over the Counter Alternatives

There are several over the counter supplements that offer natural alternatives to Phentermine. These OTC diet pills are designed to help with weight loss by boosting metabolism, burning fat, and controlling appetite, much like Phentermine but with fewer side effects.

1. PhenQ

One of the most popular and effective Phentermine alternatives is PhenQ. This all-in-one supplement works by targeting multiple aspects of weight loss. It combines ingredients like α-Lacys Reset, caffeine, nopal, and piperine (black pepper extract) to help suppress appetite, boost fat burning, and increase energy levels.

Benefits of PhenQ:

* Reduces appetite and cravings.
* Boosts fat burning and metabolism.
* Improves energy levels and focus.
* Helps prevent fat storage.

2. LeanBean

LeanBean is another excellent alternative to Phentermine, particularly designed for women. This supplement contains green tea extract, turmeric, vitamin B6, and green coffee bean extract to support fat burning and appetite suppression. It’s great for those looking for a safe, natural weight loss solution.

Benefits of LeanBean:

* All-natural formula targeted specifically for women.
* Suppresses appetite and enhances fat burning.
* Stabilizes energy levels throughout the day.
* Reduces fatigue during exercise.

3. Instant Knockout

Initially developed for professional athletes and fitness enthusiasts, Instant Knockout has become a popular OTC fat burner. This supplement includes ingredients like green tea extract, cayenne pepper, glucomannan (konjac root), and caffeine to suppress appetite and increase thermogenesis for faster fat loss.

Benefits of Instant Knockout:

* Enhances fat burning and energy levels.
* Suppresses appetite and increases focus.
* Ideal for those who work out regularly.
* Safe and natural alternative to Phentermine.

4. TrimTone

Benefits of TrimTone:

* Suppresses appetite and boosts metabolism.
* Promotes fat burning and energy enhancement.
* Convenient one-pill-per-day dosage.
* Made with natural, safe ingredients.

Key Ingredients in Natural OTC Diet Pills

The effectiveness of Phentermine alternatives over the counter is largely due to the quality ingredients they contain. Here are some of the most common and powerful ingredients found in natural diet pills:

1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea is known for its powerful antioxidants and fat-burning properties. It contains catechins that boost metabolism and increase fat burning, making it a popular ingredient in many weight loss supplements.

2. Green Coffee Bean Extract

Green coffee bean extract is high in chlorogenic acid, which helps to lower the absorption of carbohydrates and improve fat metabolism. It also has antioxidant properties that support overall health.

3. Caffeine

Caffeine is one of the most commonly used stimulants in weight loss supplements. It boosts metabolism, increases energy, and improves focus. Caffeine also helps suppress appetite, making it a great addition to fat-burning formulas.

4. Cayenne Pepper

Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, a compound that increases body temperature, boosts metabolism, and helps burn fat more efficiently. It also acts as an appetite suppressant.

5. Glucomannan

Glucomannan is a natural fiber derived from the root of the konjac plant. When consumed, it absorbs water and expands in the stomach, leading to a feeling of fullness and reducing appetite. It is a common ingredient in appetite-suppressing supplements.

6. Ginger

Ginger is known for its digestive benefits and its ability to increase metabolism and promote fat burning. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that support overall health and well-being.

1juuyju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1juuyju/financial_anxiety_as_a_new_entrepreneur/,Financial anxiety as a new entrepreneur,"As someone who transitionned from being an employee at a full-time job depending on a guaranteed  steady salary every month, to being an entrepreneur and running your own business, how do you deal with the financial anxiety when you know that you no longer have a steady guaranteed salary that is going to reach your bank account every end of month to be able to cover your expenses?

There are some things you can do that I think can help to deal with financial anxiety as a new entrepreneur, like:

* **Savings:** Having cash stashed in a savings account and always allocating a percentage of your income towards savings in order to have a financial buffer to depend on during dry business months.
* **Decreasing expenses:** Adapting careful money management and budgeting habits to reduce unnecessary expenses and know where your money is going every month so you can adjust your spendings accordingly.
* **Increasing income:** Working on increasing income by finding new clients, retaining or upselling existing clients, and working on ways to improve your product or service in order to attract new clients.
* **Real-world motivations:** For example, I have a habit of watching small and medium-sized businesses in the streets and telling myself ""if all of these people are managing to survive as entrepreneurs, there is no reason I cannot, with patience, work, and consistency"".

But even if I am doing these things, I still always feel on ""survival mode"" with questions going in my mind like:

* What If I go for multiple dry months and I burn through all savings? having no more money to cover my expenses? landlord will not wait for my business to grow before he kicks me out of the house if I can't pay rent (this happened to me before, and I was forced to go back to a full-time job, then quit and started again when I saved enough to restart, but I don't want to go through that again)
* What if someday I decide to get married, is this a sustainable way to start and support a family?

The way I personally see it, there are 3 stages to dealing with this financial anxiety as an entrepreneur:

* **Stage 1:** Focusing on your main business trying to stay afloat and to make as much revenue from it as possible while saving heavily.
* **Stage 2:** Using savings you accumulated from your main business to invest in low-maintenance, market-proof cash businesses (café, restaurant, etc.) Businesses like this are easy to run on autopilot with your minimal intervention by delegating its entire day-to-day operations, and they can easily generate a steady monthly revenue to give you peace of mind in case of dry months from your main business. I mean, some families' livelihoods are entirely dependant on the revenue of 1 coffee shop or restaurant, so I believe having these businesses on the side of your main business is a good idea, they are easy to delegate so you can shift your focus towards your other businesses that need your presence and attention, and they provide a steady revenue.
* **Stage 3:** Once you save enough money from your main business and your side-businesses, you can get into real estate, which I believe is the most stable revenue stream you can depend on.

Are you dealing with financial anxiety as a new entrepreneur? what are your recommendations to manage this anxiety at least in the beginning having only 1 business and source of revenue? let me know what you think.",3,1744164625.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False

In the beginning, everything felt like a dream and things were very passionate and romantic.  Before we were officially a couple, I'd been doing a lot of work to improve myself (both mentally and physically) with great success, but after dating him for this long and adapting my lifestyle to meet him where he's at, I've hit a major decline and just don't feel like myself anymore, esspecially when I'm around him.

To be more specific, I was the type to be outside, hiking with friends, going to parties, karaoke every week and so on.  I tried to be active and social as much as I could be, and I felt like my life was headed the direction I wanted it to.  He, on the other hand, sleeps in till noon, maybe has a coffee or an energy drink, goes to work, comes home, eats one meal for the day, then stays up till 2am playing games or watching videos.  Over time he seemed to stop wanting to or feeling motivated to take me out or do actual activities with me unless I directly bring it up.  When I'm with him or spend the night, we almost never leave the house.

Now don't get me wrong, he's a very kind and sweet person (as far as I can tell) And I can tell he really loves me and enjoys spending time with me, but I can't help but feel like I'm losing part of myself after conforming to his schedule.

Another big part of this is the goals we have in life.  I eventually want to own a home, travel the world, and fill my life with experiences and stories to share and be proud of the things I've done.  I also have my current job because of it's flexibility and freedom to support my secondary career as an artist.  My bf want's a house (like most people our age braket) and kids... and that's pretty much it.  He says his dream career is to be a musician.  I'm not opposed to kids, in fact I would love to have children, but with the right person, and with the right support.  I've asked him before what kind of job he'd like to have and his response is always something vague like ""one that pays better"".  And when I asked him specifically what kind of career he'd have to support himself/fall back on while he works on his music, he always just ""doesn't know"".

I feel so frustrated because I know I truly love this man, and I've never felt more loved before.  My only other relationships before this, I was the one to get broken up with (one of them cheated and broke up before I found out, and the other one admitted he wanted to ""see other people"" after I saw dating apps on his phone) so it feels strange to be on the side of the person losing romantic feelings.  I'd like to still have him as a friend because we get along so well outside of our lifestyle choices, and being around him is fun and fulfilling, but I'm unsure if I could spend the rest of my life conforming to or just having to put up with his way of life, nevermind trying to raise a family with him.

Ideally I'd want to talk this out with him in person, maybe decide if it's something we could work on and get back to later in life if we align more in the future (I really don't see myself dating anyone else anytime soon), but I think I need time to reset myself and get back on track to the person I was becoming.  Any advice on how to bring up this topic without making him feel like it's his fault, or helping me articulate that we just aren't headed the same way in life would be helpful.  He has a gentle heart and I'd like to mitigate any pain this will inevitably cause us both.

TL;DR! I feel like my bf and I are heading in different directions, and I want to ask him to just be my friend.  How do I bring this up without hurting him so much?",2,1744164456.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Additionally, the construction quality, including joinery and finishing techniques, plays a crucial role in the longevity and stability of the table. Tables with solid wood construction and meticulous detailing tend to last longer and maintain their aesthetic value over time.

**Integrated Storage:** many contemporary chess tables feature built-in storage compartments designed to house chess pieces, score sheets, and other accessories. These compartments are often lined with felt or similar soft materials to protect the pieces from scratches and damage.The storage compartments may be located beneath the playing surface, within drawers, or incorporated into the table's base. The size and configuration of the storage area vary depending on the table's design, with some models offering dedicated slots for individual chess pieces to ensure organized storage.

**Playing Surface Dimensions:** The size of the playing surface is a critical consideration,notably for serious chess players. Tournament-standard chessboards typically have squares that measure between 2 and 2.5 inches. The overall dimensions of the playing surface should accommodate these square sizes while providing ample space around the board's perimeter for comfortable play.A cramped playing surface can hinder movement and detract from the overall experience. Tables with larger surfaces also offer greater adaptability for accommodating oversized or decorative chess pieces.

**Leg design and Stability:** The leg design contributes significantly to the table's overall stability and aesthetic appeal. sturdy legs constructed from solid wood or metal are essential for preventing wobbling or tilting during gameplay.Different leg styles, such as cabriole legs, pedestal bases, and tapered legs, can complement various interior décor styles. The height of the legs should also be considered to ensure comfortable playing posture. Tables with adjustable legs offer added versatility, allowing users to customize the height to their preference.

Key features of a quality chess table include:

* Durable materials such as hardwood
* Ample storage for chess pieces and accessories
* Comfortable playing surface dimensions
* Stable leg design for secure gameplay

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Alright, folks, gather 'round for the battle of the birds: the Calgary Flames versus the Anaheim Ducks. It's a matchup that promises more drama than a soap opera and more excitement than a toddler with a sugar rush.

The Flames are on a mission, folks. They're like a kid trying to sneak one more cookie before bedtime—determined and relentless. With goaltender Dustin Wolf declaring that they can't afford to lose any more games, you can bet the Flames will be bringing the heat. They've won four straight and seven of their last eight meetings against the Ducks. If history is any indicator, the Flames are basically the Ducks' kryptonite.

On the other side, the Ducks are fresh off a win against the Edmonton Oilers, despite their coach's less-than-glowing review of their performance. Let's face it, when your goalie, Lukas Dostal, stops 45 shots and bails you out of six power plays, you might want to buy him a nice dinner—or at least a coffee.

Now, let's talk odds. The Flames are favored at 1.68 on most books, and for good reason. They've got momentum, motivation, and a playoff spot in their sights. The Ducks, meanwhile, are sitting at around 2.25, which might be tempting if you're feeling lucky or just enjoy rooting for the underdog.

But let's get to the meat of it: my best bet. Given the Flames' recent dominance over the Ducks and their current form, I'd take Calgary on the moneyline at 1.68. If you're feeling a bit more adventurous and think the Flames will really turn up the heat, consider taking them on the spread at -1.5 for a juicier payout.

So, there you have it. Expect the Flames to come out blazing, and the Ducks to be, well, ducking for cover. May the best bird win!

***Tuesday*** 

*RED ALERT! RED ALERT!* Robbie mused to himself an hour later after Mason and Kulon had finished the dishes, and the true gryps invited Mason downstairs to watch a movie in their apartment’s movie room. Charlie had fallen asleep on his shoulder, and he was surfing through cooking shows, killing time until Sam came home.

Llyr had appeared in the kitchen behind his seat, searching the kitchen before locating Robbie in the living room facing the massive TV above Llyr’s chair. He opened his mouth to speak but stopped when Robbie scowled and pressed a finger to his lips, his eyes sliding sideways to Charlie.

The fact that Llyr’s eyes moved with him said he hadn’t noticed her at all. Robbie would’ve taken exception to that, had he not spent years living with Llyr’s son and known what Sam was like when he got tunnel vision on something. The Mystallian rolled his head towards the hallway leading down his side of the apartment. Robbie nodded in agreement, unsure which room Llyr planned to take them to.

So he could carefully monitor Charlie, Robbie elongated his neck the way Mr Fantastic would while softening his body to guide her smoothly down onto the sofa with a cushion under her head. “Be right back, sweet pea,” he whispered, not actually daring to kiss her since Charlie was a light sleeper (which was why he’d had to pull out all the stops just to get her horizontal). Any wetness, even from his lips, would have her up and awake for hours.

Satisfied she was still asleep, he walked around the coffee table and followed Llyr down the hallway to Sam’s office. The moment there was a shut door between them and Charlie, Llyr turned on him. “What happened today? And do *not* give me the runaround. Sam not being here was weird enough, but the atmosphere at that meal…” —he pointed sharply towards the kitchen— “…was as if someone had died.”

Robbie carded his hair with his fingers and sighed. “Someone nearly did.” At Llyr’s savage intake, he quickly spat out, “Not Sam.” With that critical detail covered, he continued on more normally. “The sex traffickers found Mason again. The pryde tracked them down and brought him home, and physically, he’s fine. Mentally, he’s been put back a few paces at least.”

Llyr squinted and folded his arms. “And?”

Yeah, this was going to be the tricky part. “And … they turned up here too. *Sam’s fine!”* he barked out over the top of whatever expletive Llyr was about to bellow. “He never left the apartment. I wouldn’t let him.”

The statement seemed to confuse Llyr. “You wouldn’t…*what?”*

“Sam wanted to go out with Rubin and attack the traffickers outside the apartment. No … not just attack them. He wanted to tear them to pieces for what they did to Mason and Angelo. His words. I had to restrain him with force. He’s not happy with me, but he stayed safe. Right now, he took Gerry over to her father’s for dinner, because he needed some time away from us to destress.”

“And where is Gerry’s father living now?”

“Nooooo…you’re not going over there, Llyr,” Robbie said, rubbing his brow in frustration. “The whole point of the exercise was to get some distance between him and divinity. He’ll be back later tonight because it is a school night, and you can catch up with him then, if you want.”

Llyr seemed to think about that for a second, then nodded. “Alright. I can work with that.” Then he surprised the life out of Robbie by asking, “Is everyone on our side accounted for?”

This was new … Llyr giving a trap about anyone other than Sam. Robbie grinned and relaxed. “Yeah. We’re all here. The pryde has now decided to become the sex slavers’ personal nemesis…”

Llyr’s hand flew to his mouth, then they dropped to his hips as he flung his head back and roared with laughter. It took him several beats before he could stop laughing, and even then he had to wipe the tears from his eyes. “Oh, what I wouldn’t give to be able to bend one of those bastards and see their demise for myself.”

His eyes shone, and his smile was huge. “You’ll never understand the fear the Known Realms have for just one true gryps.” He held up one finger. “One. And to know that the entire pryde … the most concentrated number of true gryps in all of existence … has decided certain members of humanity have breathed their last?” He rubbed his hands together gleefully and shook his head. “I would give a great deal to see that encounter for myself, regardless of how brief it would be.”

He was still snickering when he turned away, saying, “Have Sam call me when he gets home. We still need to talk.”

“Llyr, wait!” Robbie called when it became apparent he was about to realm-step away. The Mystallian paused and gave him the side-eye over his shoulder. “If this is a date night for him, and I think it is despite everything, then talking to his dad will be the last thing he’s going to want to do when he gets home with his girl, you know?” Robbie arched his eyebrow and tilted his head, hoping he wouldn’t have to draw Llyr a map beyond that.

Llyr dragged his fingers and thumb across his bottom lip, pinching it in the middle. “Fine. She’ll go to sleep at some point,” he said, staring off into space. “Have him call me then.”

All damage to Sam’s face should be well and truly sorted by then. It was probably already gone, but Robbie wasn’t prepared to take that chance. “Sure.”

\* \* \*

Having showered and eaten her fill of the celebratory dinner Sararah had ordered in from a dozen different takeout places, Pepper was in her pjs at one end of the sofa with her feet on her friend’s lap, watching TV. Well, Sarah seemed to be watching TV. Pepper’s head was resting on the arm of the sofa, her eye half-closed from the sheer bliss of having every ache rubbed out of her feet by her extremely gifted roommate. “Oooh…don’t —don’t stop,” she moaned, meaning that with every fibre of her being. “Please, please, please. I’ll clean the bathroom for a month if you just…don’t…stop.”

Sararah chuckled, sliding her fingers between Pepper’s toes. “Luckily for you, you became the Plus-One of something that specialises in all forms of seduction and foreplay, including intimate massage.”

“I hate that I am only just finding this out about you tonight,” Pepper declared dreamily. “To think I could’ve been having this every night since I hit New York City.”

Sararah chuckled again. “It’s about now that I would start sucking on your toes, but I don’t want to make it weird.”

“Good plan, given that I’ve got a gun.”

“Happy threat, given that I’m a demon.”

As relaxed as she was, Pepper let her friend’s words bounce idly in her brain. There was no way Sararah meant the word ‘happy’, so she started playing around with rhyming words that…*crappy!* *Crappy* would’ve been the intended word! *Crappy threat.*

She dropped her head and squinted at her friend. “This rhyming schtick is getting old,” she declared.

“No argument here,” Sararah agreed, moving up to Pepper’s ankle. “It chucks.”

Pepper’s phone started ringing, and it took her a second to reengage her brain enough to remember where she left it. “Shit. Bathroom,” she said, twisting to roll off the couch and use it and the coffee table to find her feet.

Sararah used her divine strength to hold her still. “I got it,” she said, and suddenly a tentacle rose off her shoulder and darted around the corner, returning moments later with the still ringing phone.

Pepper glanced at the Caller ID before accepting the call. “Hey, Dad,” she said, as Pepper continued her ministrations. “What’s up?”

“Hey, sweetie. Nothing much. Your mom’s on the road and the house is pretty empty, so I thought I’d touch base and see how New York was treating you.”

Pepper frowned suspiciously. “Mom spends eleven months of the year on the road, Dad, and I’ve been gone three. That house has only had you in it for the better part of ten weeks, and you’re just starting to feel nostalgic now?”

Her Dad chuckled, but didn’t deny it. “I do miss you, honey. I haven’t called very often because I didn’t want you to think you had to come running back here to look after me…”

Pepper jack-knifed up onto her elbow. It was as far upright as Sararah would let her get. “Are you sick, Dad?”

“Me? God, no. I’m too damn busy at the watch tower to get sick. I just … I figured you’d reach out at some point when you were ready, but you know what they say about mountains and Muhammad. So, is the cold getting to you yet?”

Pepper’s BS detector climbed another thirty points. A guilt trip *and* a nonsense statement? “Can’t say that it has. What with being in the middle of summer and the average is seventy-five to eighty-five degrees.”

“Where is all this hostility coming from? I mean, I do have a reason for calling you, but there’s no need for you to be like that.”

Pepper took much of the bite out of her tone, even if she was still suspicious as hell. “Sorry, Dad. It’s been a long day, and right now, Sarah is working on unknotting some muscles for me. What do you need from me?” She lay back down, resting her head on the sofa’s arm again.

“Actually, I’ve been thinking lately about something I can do for you. With your mother out of town a lot, and you at the other end of the country, if anything happens to me, you might not hear about it for some time, and that bothers me.”

Again, Pepper shot up. “Has something happened?”

“No! Good Lord, girl! Will you let me say what I’m trying to say here instead of interrupting me every two seconds?”

“Sorry, Dad.”

“My point is, your mother and I want to add you to our next of kin notifications. I plan to make an appointment over the next few days with the lawyers to get that all set up, and you’ll get a package of papers to sign soon after that. Your mom and I will still retain power of attorney over each other if it comes to that, but at least this way, if anything happens, you’ll be either first or second to hear about it. That okay with you?”

Pepper scowled at her roommate, who suddenly seemed *extremely* focused on the contours of Pepper’s feet. “Sure,” she deadpanned.

“Excellent. So, that covers what I was calling for. Do you have any good news to share with us? Like maybe something important happening at work?”

And there it was.

Closing her eye so she didn’t have to glare at Sararah, she said, “Yes, Dad. I am currently running a state-wide taskforce, and yes, it is a big deal, but I can’t go into the specifics of it as it’s an ongoing investigation.” *Dammit, Sararah!*

“I’m so proud of you. You’ll be police chief soon.”

Her sigh felt like it came all the way from her toes. “Once we finish weeding out all the corruption, I think I’ll be happy to go back to being an ordinary, everyday MCS detective.”

“That sounds ominous.”

“Again, ongoing investigation. I promise, I’ll fill you in on what I can once everything is done.”

“I’ll hold you to that, Pepper. So, what about romantic interests?”

“Goodbye, Dad,” she said and hung up, knowing he’d only said that because she would react exactly the way she did. She then snatched up a cushion and rolled forward far enough to smack her roommate over the head. “You called him!” she accused, not even wording it as a question, because how else would he know about the task force?

Sararah giggled. “Maybe, but all jokes aside, it’s important that you be made his next of kin.”

“Why?”

“Lady Col made Lord Uriel promise that he wouldn’t go after me or anyone close to me in retribution for staying in Earlafaol. But here’s the thing. Lord Uriel is the son of the Lord of Lies. Everything he says has to be scrutinised for its true meaning, and it wasn’t until a few hours ago that I realised your parents might be one step too far away from me to be covered. Now, if anything happens to them, so long as they’re alive, we can help them.”

Pepper scratched her head through her thick waves of hair. “Wait, I thought Uriel was an Archangel of Heaven. A good guy…”

“Archangel of Vengeance and Crown Prince of Hell, soooo…no. Not really.”

*Well … shit.*

1juum9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypoglycemia/comments/1juum9k/low_blood_sugar/,Low Blood Sugar??,"hey yall! i honestly don't think i am hypoglycemic, but i still wanted some input on if what ive been experiencing could be due to low blood sugar. i'm 19F if that matters at all. i do apologize if i sound like an idiot for even thinking that's what this could be.

anyway, today is the second time i've had an ""episode"" if that's what you'd call it. i am not diabetic (at least to my knowledge) but it could always be a possibility, i just haven't explored that yet. 

i did go a pretty long time without eating today, i had my first meal around 7 pm. all i had was a cheeseburger and then about 20 minutes after eating it i started to get some concerning symptoms. not sure if this is relevant, but i had some coffee about an hour or so before all of this happened. 

i started to feel extremely lightheaded and a little bit dizzy. my heart started to race and i was shaking uncontrollably and sweating a lot. at first, i thought it could've been an anxiety attack, but usually those are caused by my mind racing and i have been mentally well recently. i was literally just sitting in bed on my phone. the first time this was the case too. 

i immediately grabbed myself a granola bar and a root beer to give myself some carbs and sugar and within about 10 minutes i started to feel better. 

i did not check my blood sugar, but if it happens again, i will definitely use my step dad's blood glucose meter and check it. i was honestly thinking i was crazy and i didn't want my mom to think i was being crazy too. i've always been super anxious and worried about my health so she's used to me overreacting. 

i would also like to mention that i do have an iron deficiency but my symptoms have never gotten that bad. it sort of felt like i was going to faint, and im certain that if i didn't take action, i very well could've. 

i guess im just asking for insight on the entire thing. it could be something else entirely, but i had gone almost 20 hours without eating. the weird thing is, ive done that before with absolutely no issues like this. it's kind of freaking me out lol.

Actual sound design and sequencing happens with hardware, but as far as EQ, effects, compression etc is concerned I stay in Ableton.

Every now and then I get this urge to drop large amounts of money on some rack gear. Distressors, an Overstayer unit, EQs and preamps. Whatever. Ostensibly for the hands on control and bump in fidelity, but if I'm being honest with myself part of it is just GAS. I'm a childless professional in a good financial position, so the $5-$7k I would spend is not the biggest deal in the world.

However I usually chicken out due to the total lack of convenience compared to software. My current process is to sit in the studio and bang out ideas for songs, recording stems and roughly mixing on the fly. Once that's done I start refining, and I love how that can happen anywhere. Studio, apartment, at the coffee shop or while on vacation. I can also jump from track to track and tinker for months on end.

With outboard gear this would not be the case. Mixing can only while happen while I'm glued to my studio chair, and jumping between tracks becomes a photography project. The time I have available to hone mixes becomes much less, simply because I'm not always home. 

Is this really worth it? I would think it has to be on some level, especially since many of my favorite artists do it, but I think it might not be for me. Would be curious to hear what others peoples experience is with this. ",2,1744163342.0,audioengineering,18,0.6,False

I'm happy to build a connection and trust and chat at length, and all. No problem. 
I'll meet at the local super market in the baking aisle  to show that I am who I say I am, but I can't meet for coffee. I live in a small village. 100% chance of being recognized. (I have done the baking aisle meet once and we hooked up after. That was fun!)

I go to the city to the office once a week, but that is challenging,  too, to make time for play. You have to get a day use and then the travel and coördination is challenging. And the hooker situation is even worse. 99%

Years ago you could go on craigslist and there was a 30% chance you'd connect with a real woman, who was interested in something casual and recurring. That has gone away. It all gets flagged immediately and removed. And if by some miracle it stays up for a bit all you get is offers for money.  Or scammers asking for gas money or deposits. 

Sure, I  could sign up for AM or tinder or okcupid or any of the others, but the W4M is flooded with bots and scams. I have done that, too. Weeding through this is exhausting and depressing and I don't have time for that. 
Doublelist (supposedly the CL replacement) is worse...

The worst part? You can't even talk to anyone about it. Cheating is frowned upon. So I sit here, with my dead bedroom situationship and no feasible way out for the next ten years (I have a small-ish child).
And I can stew in it and trying in vain to find someone local,  in a similar situation, my age, not a prostitute,  or a domme, or a Nigerian Princess. 

Alone, with my thoughts, in my head. When all I need is, to just get laid every few weeks... very frustrating 😕 

I don't even remember why I came here, but writing all that was cathartic. Spare me the hate. 

I'm too old for that. Only 10 more years, i suppose

i’m turning 27 and i usually host chill fun backyard hang outs for my birthday every year with a bonfire and some snacks and drinks. I love my backyard as it has a solid chill vibe. 

Unfortunately, my grandmother whom I live with is receiving chemotherapy currently and I just want her to have a restful environment and not risk her being around amass of people.

I don’t drink. So a brewery vibe sounds very interesting but the food is often times mid and i am sober so it doesn’t excite me but I am open to it! I think if they have good food or vibes it could entice me. Also if theres an opportunity for me to rent a portion out for my friends and family that would be nice! 

Things I would appreciate: :)

- chill vibe where people can chat and enjoy each others company
- not super loud music
- good food
- able to hold about 50 people? more or less? likely less 
- not super duper expensive? I can probably put in like $400 ish to reserving a portion of a place? Id prefer if people are able pay for their own stuff. 
- downey / whittier area LA/OC 
some really cool environments to me would be like if i could rent a coffee shop in the evening? or have some kind of moody chill vibe. Anything remotely nerdy really matches my vibe. Before my lola got sick i was planning on doing a trivia themed birthday in the backyard. My best friend had her birthday at a wine bar in anaheim which was super cool and i loved the vibes but it was like all wine which doesn’t match me.

I’m also kind of open to renting out an event space and making it my own depending on how much that might cost? 

If i fail in finding a spot my back up plan was just having all my loved ones go to medieval times with me which also sounds fun but i don’t get to chit chat with a lot of people!

Things had been going incredibly well, had our first ""official"" date after many little coffee/lunch dates. Had an amazing time, first kiss, called each other and talked all the way home. Next day we lamented that we had to work and couldn't hang out. She said she had ""all the feels""...anyway...all the good stuff. She's (43f) and separated for 3.5 years. I'm (45m) and divorced myself. Early on we spoke about priorities in life and she made it very clear hers was her children...I completely understand, I have a kid too who is my world. She just re-entered the dating world after taking a year away and I was the first person she dated. I guess to try to keep this short, despite that things were going EXTREMELY well, we had found less and less time to be able to hang out and she told me that ""maybe she's not in a place in life to be dating anyone and that waiting around for us to find a few nights wasn't fair to me."" I said I completely understood where her priorities lay and that I was fine with taking things slowly, she thanked me for my patience and talked about getting together later that weekend. Fast forward 3 days...hadn't heard a peep from her, no calls, no texts, nothing and then we have a call and she said again that she's not in a place in life to be in a relationship right now an is prioritizing reconnecting with her friends, fitness, getting back in touch with her own body, health, therapy, and of course kids (keep in mind she is a breast cancer survivor - double mastectomy with reconstruction and hysterectomy in the last 2.5 years). I again said I was comfortable taking things as slowly as she needed. Again, heard nothing for three days, then today I texted and said we should get together for coffee since this is something she said we should do on our last phone call. She said that wouldn't be a good idea. I asked what had changed over the course of the last 5 days. She said ""I don't need to justify that I'm not interested."" I said I understood, said it was great getting to know her and wished her the best. She did say early on that she's an Avoidant Attachment style person and has a tendency to run, in fact when we first started dating her therapist was excited for her and said they needed to focus on breaking those patterns of running.

1012 word Excerpt:

    Our platoon was led by 2nd Lieutenant Dick Champion in Normandy back when Havoc was at full strength. A goof-up from Princeton transferee Johnny Law saw us down to twenty men. Both officers lived up to their names. Dick Champion was daring and fearless, with the competence to win, while his 1st Lieutenant was just some Johnny who worshipped the law. Dick Champion’s command base consisted of a tent draped over a downed tree. Johnny Law prepped coffee, serving as Dick’s orderly as everyone else was dead currently. 1st Lieutenant Law stood when I entered—his square hair hitting the canopy, square jaw tensing, square personality quickly ashamed he stood at attention to a lower rank. I was a foot taller and eighty pounds stronger than every man in camp, so I suppose my presence signaled some tribal sense of repute to the scrawny Law.
    
    “You wanted to see me, sirs?”
    
    Dick looked up from his dripping papers.
    
    “I read your report, Sergeant Boom. If there is a Nazi fortress up in those hills, we’ll need to clear it out before Holly Company moves by. Can’t risk a flank of unknown shape and size. How are the men?”
    
    “Holding steady, as always.”
    
    “You’re down to half strength, Nap,” Dick said.
    
    “And a quarter the brains of any other squad,” Lieutenant Law said.
    
    He firmly planted his folding chair down in the corner. Part of the canopy fell in response, but I snatched it from spilling gallons of melted snow on the lieutenants.
    
    “We’re still good men. Expect no less from us, Lieutenant.”
    
    “All the same. You’ll need extra men for any maneuvering. Scout this fortress out, and we’ll mobilize everyone else behind you.""
    
    Stepping out of the tent, I heard the lieutenants commence an argument. I stopped and was curious for a moment but got the better of myself and kept walking. It was above my pay.
    
    My squad was reversing through camp in the Kubelwagen, sending fellow soldiers scurrying left and right to evade, some landing in mud. Corporal Thimbles was grinning, honking the horn, and cursing everyone in his way. While Preach kept his head down, trying not to associate. My mind drafted up a strict reprimand, but who knows what’s to come—best let the boys play.
    
    “Why are you in the actual middle of the road!” Thimbles yelled, “Whoa! Preach, look, it’s Woody!”
    
    “Wo-o-o-dy!”
    
    Woody ran alongside the car, chatting with the fellas.
    
    “Hey, guys, what are you two knuckleheads doing in Europe?”
    
    “Is he new too?” private Nimrod asked from the backseat.
    
    “No, Woody’s part of the Go-Around Boys,” I said, walking up.
    
    “Shucks, ’til I got promoted out, it was me, Preach, Thimbles, and Koogleman,” Woody said.
    
    “Who’s Koogleman?”
    
    “Koogleman died,” Thimbles cut in. “Plus some other nimrods, but we didn’t talk to them. We only talked to Koogleman.”
    
    “You’re replacing Koogleman.” Preach clarified.
    
    Private Quigley looked horrified.
    
    Woody chipped up to fill the silence. “Sorry, boys, gotta run. I’ve got privates to wrangle now.”
    
    “Just like the showers in basic, huh, Woody.” Thimbles said.
    
    “Good ol' Woody, love that guy.” Preach said, watching Woody walk away.
    
    “Boys!” I clapped my hands. “Eyes up, we’re on patrol!”
    
    “No-o-o, not the dead man’s fortress, Sarge,” Nimrod said.
    
    I climbed in back and cozied up. There was a yell from behind me, and I could tell that the melted snow won another victory against Dick Champion’s tent. I felt a little sorry for the paperwork, though. 
    
    “Can it Nimrod. Keep your eyes peeled for Jerries while I rest mine,” I said and closed my peepers.
    
    “Great leadership, Nap,” Thimbles muttered.
    
    “Just follow the smoothest road, Corporal.”
    
    I had the men call me Nap, and I made sure to sleep plenty to cement the nickname. They saw it as a favor that they didn’t have to suck up and call me Sir. But my real name is Napoleon Boom, and that’s a can of worms I don’t want to open. Smirking at my cleverness, I drifted off as we glided through the snow-covered meadows, a fresh batch of white softly floating down through the clear highland air. I drifted far into my dreams, all the same as ever, but how vivid. In my dream, the snow turned to embers. I saw myself, grey-breaded and roaring, swinging a Viking great axe in some northern village. Then I dreamt of I was a brigand, a pirate chased by the British Empire in the South Seas. I dreamt that—
    
    “Wake-y Wake-y, Eggs and Grenades.”
    
    My heart swelled for a moment, feeling I would wake up back home next to my beautiful American wife. The branches above me were mangled now as the Kubelwagen drew closer to the looming pile of stones on the hill ahead. I took a quick glance behind me. Dick hadn’t rallied the troops too fast. We were on our own today.
    
    “Nap, it’s real. So we go back now, or…?” Thimbles asked.
    
    “Since we haven’t been shot at yet, it’s safe to assume it’s abandoned,” I said as I assessed the castle. “But we still have to make sure. Might be snipers or flak in there. It’s sure big enough to hold ‘em.”
    
    The castle was straight out of a Knights and Princesses serial, and a real old one at that. The wooden window hatches were either crookedly hanging off or long gone, and the parapets were crumbled into rounded teeth. Clearly, the kingdom had gone some years without a good king. I pulled my officer’s cap from my coat for a makeshift pillow.
    
    “You’ll be alright, Corporal. Wake me when we’re at the gate,” I said.
    
    “I don’t like the texture of the walls,” Preach said.
    
    “It’s not from a period befitting of my count-ly disposition. Do you have anything with more books?” Thimbles said mocking Preach’s soft drawl.
    
    Kid Quigley smiled at that one. This put a huge grin on Thimble's face before he realized it was the kid and socked Quigley hard in the arm.
    
    “Yeah, no, really,” Preach said, “why are the walls slimy?”",1,1744162843.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

Animals, houses, engaged, planning on opening up a business together. I was going back to school specifically to help her realize her dream of opening her own coffee shop. She's never been great with math and I didn't have any background in bookkeeping, but I was straight up about to invest money that was left to me when my mom passed away in my early 20s so I could develop some accounting skills. She told me that's how I could support her and I was thrilled for a new challenge - one we were going to embark on together. I was so excited to help her realize this dream and even more so, excited for her to actually enjoy what she did for a living instead of being brow beaten from the demands of her job. We were about to pull the trigger, but then one day she just stopped coming home. She started acting all weird and sketchy, picking up her phone and tilting the screen away from me when she's never done that before.
She also stopped talking about how much she hated her job as a district manager and instead focused way more about how she just promoted this one guy that she had a lot in common with. Silly anime tattoos, closeted yet professional dorks, she even had the audacity to tell me that I would really like him and that she wanted us all to hang out together (him and his wife! He was also married.)
I repressed my instincts. She's never given me any reasons not to trust her and she's always been so intentional with planning. She helped keep me on track and we were actively working on taking our next steps together to build what I thought was going to be a long, happy, exciting life together.

Then DDay came. She kicked me out of our house, she packed up all my stuff and she sent it to my sisters. I didn't even know she was cheating at that point... I thought there was something I did wrong but I only found out this past weekend that she was emotionally cheating on me. I feel absolutely gut torn, it's like being swept up in waves and waves of confusion and pain and feeling unimportant to then also be compounded with the fact that she chose the guy I didn't have to worry about. A guy she wasn't even supposed to have a friendship with, let alone anything else. Her company (works for a pretty famous coffee place, if you know the one) has an extremely strict close relationship policy and she has always been a stickler for rules. I liked that about her, but in retrospect I think that belief I held about her made me into more of a clown.

I haven't slept for 2 days. I broke my sobriety. I'm doing my best, I'm seeing a counselor, I've been to the hospital, I'm trying to do the work but I can't close my eyes without feeling nauseated. She's absolutely destroyed me. I know the pain will heal, I know I'm trying my best, but I was so, so blindsided and I don't think I've felt this level of grief since my mom passed. I want it to be over, I'm so desperate for some peace but it feels like she's taken absolutely everything from me. I don't know how to come back from this. 

I need help, I need support, a friendly word even. I'm desperately clinging to anything that keeps me upright, sober, and safe. I'm sickened that she's not even thinking about how badly she sent my life careening off the edge. God, I want this to be over",3,1744162598.0,survivinginfidelity,3,0.8,False

The Hare settled me into the chair with strange care, like a child putting down a favorite toy they weren’t sure still worked. Emergency lighting sputtered overhead, drowning the chamber in a queasy red blink. Shadows pulsed in rhythm with my heart.

The creature crouched at the far end of the steel table, motionless—almost reverent. Its slouching top hat veiled its face in darkness, but I saw enough. Tufts of fur were missing from its scalp, ears limp and twitching at its sides like wilting petals.

It had changed since Alice’s journal. Grown stranger. Meaner.

Less Hare.

More Hatter.

“I know you,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “You’re… Mister Neither.”

It nodded, quick and jittery. “Yes, yes, of course. And you’re Mister Reyes! So nice to make your a-acquaintance.” It reached into its coat pocket, arm vanishing deep past the elbow as ancient trinkets tumbled out—buttons, keys, scraps of burned paper. Too many things for any one coat to hold.

“What are you looking for?” I asked.

It frowned, eyes hidden behind the brim. “A teacup,” it murmured, like that should’ve been obvious. “What else?”

With a delighted gasp, it withdrew a cracked piece of china and set it on the table between us like an offering. The porcelain was yellowed, rimmed with filth.

“What do you want with me?” I asked, hating the way my voice shook.

It smiled—thin, off-kilter. “To understand you. To read you. I adore broken little boys and girls. Shattered hearts. Splintered minds. They’re my favorite bedtime stories.” The smile twitched wider. “I like to help them see how the story ends.”

Then its expression stuttered—glitched. Froze. A tremor ran through its frame.

Something was wrong.

Light flared behind the veil of the top hat, twin glows like distant moons. It started to wheeze. Choke. That whimsical, stammering cadence began to twist, deforming into something dry and mechanical.

It gripped the brim of its hat like a drowning man clutching a rope. “No,” it rasped. “We agreed. I was to speak to him. You promised—”

Its body lurched. Bones cracked like gunshots.

The spine surged beneath its suit, bulging like a worm beneath silk. Fabric split at the seams. The frame beneath it grew taller, thicker. Wrong.

And still the smile stayed.

But it wasn’t his anymore.

“You talked to him,” snarled a voice no longer touched by stutter or warmth. “My turn.”

I couldn’t move. My heart pounded like it was trying to escape my chest. I recognized this. The split. The sickness. *This was what Alice had seen.*

The Hare was gone.

Only the Hatter remained.

It rose above me in a smooth, nightmarish glide, moonlight-eyes burning through the fabric of its hat like searchlights. Its teeth were no longer bucked—they were pointed now. Arrowheads. Fangs. The drooping ears had shot upward, rigid and twitching.

“Hello,” it said softly. Coldly. “Care for a cup of tea?”

It set the teacup in front of me with eerie precision. I stared down into it, hands trembling.

“It’s empty,” I croaked.

“Look again.”

It grabbed a fistful of my hair and slammed my head into the table. Once. Twice. Again. The world became spinning metal and ringing noise. Something hot trickled down my face.

Blood.

Tears.

The Hatter lifted the cup and held it beneath my eye, collecting every drop. Then it dropped it back onto the table with a hollow *clack*.

I blinked blearily at the mix of red and salt, my stomach twisting.

“What… what is this?”

The smile didn’t change. It didn’t need to.

“Tea,” it said.

I shook my head.

The voice dropped to a low growl. A wolf beneath words.

“Drink it all up. Unless you’d like some more.”

My fingers closed around the chipped porcelain, hands shaking.

What choice did I have?

It was warm.

It tasted of salt and metal and something older. Something sad and lost.

The moment it touched my tongue, the world cracked. Not like glass. Like a spine.

The chamber shivered. My skin went cold. Then hot. Then—

**Falling.**

My chair vanished beneath me. The table, the Hatter, the red light—all of it vanished. Swallowed by ink. I plummeted through it like a ragdoll down an endless throat, gravity turning sideways, then inside out.

Shapes flickered past me—faces I couldn’t name, voices I thought I’d forgotten. The air buzzed with words I hadn’t spoken since childhood.

I screamed.

No one heard.

Then the screaming stopped. And I was sitting.

Not in the steel chair. But a wooden one.

Feet dangling above a dusty floor.

My hands were small again. Dirty fingernails. Scuffed knuckles.

I was back in the kitchen.

Back in *her* house.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sunlight leaked through slats in boarded windows, casting stripes of gold and shadow across the breakfast table. The old typewriter clacked softly from across the room. Across from me sat the Ma’am, her old typewriter clacking like bones on iron. Her glasses rested low on her nose. Her eyes didn’t lift.

I never called her mother.

I wasn’t allowed to.

She said “Ma’am” was a sign of respect. Said it would make me a better boy than the others. The ones she sent outside. The ones who died in the thousand-acre wood.

“You’re staring,” she snapped, without looking up. “You know that isn’t welcome behavior, Boy.”

I mumbled an apology, staring down at my eggs.

Her fingers began to drum on the typewriter—slow, arrhythmic. The way they always did when the anger started rising.

“Eat, Boy. Carol didn’t make those eggs so you could spin your fork in them, did you, Carol?”

A pot clattered behind me.

Carol—the older woman who watched over the stove like a priest at the altar—hurried forward with her own plate of eggs and potatoes. Her hands trembled, but her smile was warm. Always warm. Somehow.

“He’ll learn, dear,” she said gently. “He’s still just a child.”

I smiled back at her. Grateful. Even now, I could feel it—that aching kind of affection, sharp as breath after a nightmare. She tried to protect me.

She set her plate on the table, then ruffled my hair with a weathered hand.

“He can’t help being a rascal on occasion,” she teased. “Isn’t that right, Levi?”

The sound of porcelain exploding broke the moment.

The Ma’am had slammed her coffee mug so hard it detonated across her desk. Boiling liquid splashed her wrist. She didn’t flinch.

Her eyes were locked on Carol. Burning.

“What did I say about using that name?” she hissed. “He is to be referred to as Boy until he earns the right to be anything more.”

Carol froze. Her smile evaporated.

The Ma’am’s eyes slid to me. Her lips barely moved.

“Isn’t that right… Boy?”

I nodded quickly. Stuffed a forkful of egg into my mouth. Chewed like it might save me.

Carol’s voice was smaller now. “It’s just… maybe he’d do better if he had more encouragement. More love.”

The Ma’am rose.

The slap came before the thought.

Carol staggered, a sharp sound cracking the air as the slap landed. The Ma’am’s hand rose again.

I was on my feet before I could stop myself.

“Don’t!”

She turned to me. Slowly. Like a snake disturbed mid-coil.

“What did you say?” Her voice was a hiss. “Did you just give me a command, Boy?”

She stepped forward.

The Ma’am was small, brittle. Her goldenrod hair might have once been beautiful, but her face was sunken now—cheekbones sharp enough to cut, eyes like dried-up wells.

And still, I was terrified.

My mouth moved before my mind could stop it.

“It wasn’t a command, Ma’am,” I stammered, trying to steady my voice. “I only meant… it wasn’t Carol’s fault. I messed up. I deserve the punishment.”

She blinked.

Then smiled.

That awful, satisfied smile.

She turned to Carol, voice light and sweet. “You see, you old bat? The Boy doesn’t need love. He needs discipline. And even he recognizes it.”

She settled back into her chair, fingers poised over the keys. 

“Maybe there’s hope for him yet. Maybe he won’t end up like the rest of his worthless siblings.”

Carol didn’t move.

She just stared at her plate like it might disappear if she blinked.

The Ma’am snapped again.

“Well? Are you senile? The mug! You made me break my mug! Clean it up, or I’ll send you to the woods too, you decrepit crone!”

Carol didn’t flinch. Not right away.

For a moment, her face hardened. A look I hadn’t understood back then. But I did now.

Defiance.

Then she looked at me.

And I saw it.

Not fear.

Love.

The kind that stays. Even when it can’t leave.

She knew exile would be better. Safer. Even if it meant dying out there. But she wouldn’t abandon me.

She rose, her hands trembling.

“Of course, dear,” she said softly. “My mistake.”

I wanted to scream. To stop her. To tell her it wasn’t her mistake—that none of this was. That the Ma’am deserved the woods. Deserved worse.

But I couldn’t.

This wasn’t real.

This was a memory.

Just a reel playing out inside my head, dragging me backward through time like a hook through meat.

And now… the edges were beginning to fray.

The wallpaper peeled like skin. The windows oozed. The table legs began to bend and curl like roots. The walls twisted.

And the portraits—

All those paintings.

Dozens of them. Hung crooked and bleeding from their frames. My mother’s visions. Her monster.

The Hare.

No.

The Hatter.

Each one turned to face me.

Each one smiling.

Their mouths opened in unison.

And out came my name, chanted in harmony like a lullaby at a funeral.

*“Levi…”*

*“Levi…”*

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*

“Levi…?”

I blinked. Vision swam. The world realigned.

“Are you okay, M-Mister Levi?”

I was back in Chamber 13.

The walls buzzed under flickering lights. Mister Neither crouched beside me, his long fingers worriedly combing through my hair.

I scrambled backward on instinct, heart in my throat, blood drying on my temple.

The Hare flinched like I’d hit him. “I-I’m so sorry,” he whimpered, shrinking into himself. “It’s my fault. The Hatter… he gets out sometimes—more often these days. Doesn’t like hearing no. Doesn’t like waiting.” He tapped a finger against his skull. “He lives in here, see. N-not much room for privacy.”

I tried to breathe. Tried to speak.

“It’s okay,” I managed.

It wasn’t.

“I understand.”

I didn’t.

But the Hare brightened at my lie, and that was enough. If I could just keep this half—the harmless half—behind the wheel, maybe I still had a chance.

I eased back into my seat.

“I read about you,” I said. “In a journal.”

The Hare’s long feet thumped cheerfully as he crossed the room. “Yes, yes! I saw you read. That’s why I left it for you!”

I blinked. “You left that for me?”

He nodded so fast his hat nearly spun. “Course I did. I thought about it, and then—*poof!* There it was!”

He tilted his head, ears sagging. “How did *you* get in here?”

I turned slowly toward the white wooden door. “Err… someone let me in.”

The Hare blinked like it was the most absurd thing he’d ever heard. 

I swallowed. “Listen. I’m not supposed to be here. I’m not an Inquisitor, I’m just… I’m not allowed to talk to—”

I caught the word ‘monsters’ before it fell.

“—to friends?” the Hare finished, voice small. 

“Exactly,” I croaked, exhaling. “Friends. No talking to them. Not while I’m on the clock.”

It bent low, studying my feet. “That’s odd. It doesn’t look like you’re on a c-clock.”

I forced a chuckle. “It’s just a silly turn of phrase. But since we’re friends, maybe… maybe you could do me a favor? Let me out? I’ll go find the real Inquisitor you should be meeting with.”

The Hare frowned.

“But I don’t want another friend,” he said quietly. “I like *you*.”

Shit.

“Maybe we can reschedule?” I offered. “A meeting that’s, uh… less late in the evening?” I pretended to yawn—as if my adrenaline would allow it. “It’s just about bed time for me.”

The Hare rose. His voice trembled.

“You’re not… m-making excuses, are you?” He sniffled. “Because that wouldn’t be very nice. Friends shouldn’t lie.”

I raised my hands. “No. No, of course not—”

But it was already happening.

The Hare gripped his tophat. Screwed his face into a grimace. Bones cracked. His spine rippled beneath the suit, the back of his neck bulging like something trying to crawl out.

“Oh no,” I whispered.

The Hare wheezed.

Then choked.

Then changed.

I lunged for the door. Twisted the handle.

Still locked.

Still trapped.

“*Help!*” I screamed, slamming my fists against the steel. “Please—someone—”

A shadow stretched across the wall behind me.

Heavy breath rasped inches from my neck.

“Well, well, well,” the Hatter growled. “Trying to leave already? How *terribly* rude.”

A hand like a meat hook seized my collar. Yanked. 

I was airborne.

Then—impact. The table struck me like a freight train. I skidded across it, then slammed into the wall with a crunch.

My ribs. God, something cracked.

I gasped. Crawled.

Footsteps—no. Not footsteps.

Scrapes. Crawling.

The Hatter approached me like a predator through underbrush, his limbs too long, too eager. Light pulsed from beneath the brim of his hat—searchlights in the shape of eyes.

“It seems,” he purred, dragging a claw across the concrete, “that our guest finds our hospitality lacking.”

He seized my hair. Hauled me upright.

Raised the teacup.

That awful, stained teacup.

“Perhaps,” the Hatter said, with a grin too wide for any god to love, “he’d like… a little more tea.”

And then—*click.*

The lock turned.

The white door creaked open behind him.

Silence fell like a dropped knife.

The Hatter froze.

Something—*someone*—had entered the room.

About five days ago, I decided that it was time to drop weight. My goal is 40 lbs. I am currently taking in about 1400-1600 calories a day, and I literally eat the same thing every day because it's just easier for me that way. All I drink is water and coffee each day, and I am doing cardio on an exercise bike for 20 minutes a day, mainly a HIIT circuit.

My RLS has gotten progressively better each day. I'm convinced that it's due to the diet and exercise. I'm also
convinced that RLS originates in my joints, and as I have been working out my quads and glutes, it is significantly better (I also was having knee pain, which is gone now). 

It's 9:21 pm right now where I am, and normally by this time I would feel severe RLS symptoms for the next few hours. But tonight...nothing. I feel no symptoms at all.

I'll add that when I come home from work, I head straight for the exercise bike and do a 20-minute ride and I really think that's part of the solution. Getting quads and glutes stressed and forcing blood flow has a big effect, as does eating no artificial ingredients, dairy or sugar.

I hope this helps someone. I'm happy to share my exact eating plan if anyone is interested.

## The Allure of Grind & Brew: Why Freshly Ground Matters

Before we delve into the specifics of Cuisinart’s offerings, let’s quickly touch upon why a grind and brew machine is so appealing. Buying pre-ground coffee is convenient, but you sacrifice flavor and aroma in the process. Once coffee beans are ground, they begin to lose their volatile compounds, which are responsible for their unique taste and scent. By grinding your beans right before brewing, you capture the full potential of your coffee, resulting in a richer, more flavorful cup.

## Key Features to Consider

When evaluating a Cuisinart grind and brew automatic coffee maker, there are several key features to consider:

*   **Grinder type:** Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker models typically use blade grinders. More recently they have introduced burr grinders, which generally provide a more consistent grind and help unlock the best flavor. Blade grinders chop the beans, while burr grinders crush them between two surfaces. the difference in grind consistency directly impacts the extraction process and the final taste of your coffee. If you're a serious coffee connoisseur,finding a Cuisinart grind and brew burr coffee maker is a must.
*   **Capacity:** Consider how much coffee you typically brew. Cuisinart offers models ranging from single-serve to 12-cup capacities. A Cuisinart grind and brew 12 cup model is ideal for larger households or for those who entertain frequently.
*   **Programmability:** Many Cuisinart Grind & Brew machines are programmable, allowing you to set your coffee to brew automatically at a specific time. This is a great feature for busy professionals who want to wake up to a freshly brewed pot.
*   **Brew Strength Control:** Some models offer brew strength control, allowing you to customize the intensity of your coffee. This is useful for those who prefer a bolder or milder flavor.
*   **Carafe Type:** Cuisinart offers both glass and thermal carafe options. A thermal carafe will keep your coffee hot for longer without compromising the flavor. Deciding between a glass pot and a cuisinart grind and brew thermal carafe option comes down to individual preferences regarding ease of cleaning and heat retention.
*   **Cleaning and Maintenance:** Ease of cleaning is a crucial factor. Look for models with removable parts that are dishwasher-safe. Regular cleaning is necessary to maintain optimal performance and prevent the buildup of oils and residue. Cleaning your Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker regularly extends it's lifespan and ensures the best-tasting coffee.

1juu1jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1juu1jy/is_this_how_it_starts/,Is this how it starts??,"Okay. So picture this:

Wednesday, I wake up and have diarrhea. I have a pain in my upper abdomen like right in between my ribs. Gross! I go to the dr. He says “hmmmmm. weird. The area where your pain is would make me think it’s a gallbladder issue, but diarrhea makes me think probably not. Here’s zofran for the nausea and if it doesn’t stop, come back in.”

I dont poop for FIVE DAYS after that. 

Monday I wake up. Have a lil bowel movement, but not much. I’m in pain, but like maybe it’s just a lil constipation, so whatever. I go to work. That was a mistake. I can’t stand up straight, let alone sit comfortably. I’m sweaty. I’m nauseous. I take a zofran and nothing happens. I think “maybe a nice lil coffee will get things moving.” It does not. I can hardly focus on anything. I text my bf to come pick me up to go to the dr because there is no way I can drive like this. 
I HOBBLE into the dr again. I say “remember how last week I had diarrhea? well that was the last time I had a real bowel movement.” he says “Omg! uh oh! Take some laxatives, a stool softener, and magnesium citrate. Let me know if anything changes or if it doesnt change at all.” Radicallllll. 
I go home and do all the things at once. Chugged that bottle faster than I’ve ever chugged anything. 10 minutes go by. Then 20. Then 30. I call my mom because what the hell?! She says “go on a long walk as fast as you can. It will suck, but it’ll get things moving.” I do. After my 4th lap around the block, I run inside and shit for the rest of the night. THANK GOD but also damn. That was no fun. 
The dr calls me back to check in and I say “I’m going! It’s happening! My stomach still hurts, but I’m chillin as long as it keeps comin!” 
And keep comin it did. 30 minutes after our phone call, I am quite literally peeing out of my butt. I can’t even tell where the liquid sounds are coming from. It can’t be actual pee because I would know, right? And it’s involuntary. I am not trying whatsoever to make anything happen. The liquid is CLEARRR. 
I use chatgpt to say “is this normal?” And she says “not really! It could be overflow diarrhea. Get it checked!!” Dr’s office is closed. I send a message instead, and eventually I fall asleep. 

I wake up this morning (Tuesday) and have 2 sharp cramps that happen quickly and then go away. I think “oh boy it’s comin again” and run to the bathroom. Nothing. 
I’m not bloated anymore, or at least it’s not as bad as yesterday. My stomach doesnt hurt anymore, and essentially all my other symptoms are gone. But I STILL can’t poop!! 
The dr calls this morning to ask about my frantic message about the overflow and I say “well it only happened last night, and even though I havent had a bowel movement this morning, I think I just need more stool softeners” and he says “right on, keep me updated.” 
It is now evening. I still cannot poop. I cried because I’m sick of eating flavorless food. Chatgpt is telling me to SLOW DOWN on the fiber foods so I don’t overwhelm my gut. I say I don’t wanna cook right now because I’m actually starving. What can I eat that will taste like normal person food. She says “do you wanna order something? I can help you find a good meal from a restaurant.” I say PLEASE DO and she suggests Chic fil a grilled nuggets with A LITTLE bit of honey mustard. I also decide to get a parfait but I can’t have fruits right now because it will ferment in my stomach?!?! And Chatgpt also says to take it slow w the yogurt in case it gets worse. 
I eat with probably the most joy I’ve ever felt. I think I gotta go to the bathroom. Spend 15-20 minutes in there with no results. 

My dr told me that he was ready to get me in for xrays/ct scans. I have 40 mins to decide if I should go back in or keep taking the laxatives and stool softeners. Should I be worried that my gallbladder is in the shitter like… forever?! I used to get constipated all the time as a kid, and I do have a family history of gallbladder problems, so I’m a little scared. How did yall realize you have a more serious gut issue?

No matter what you do, your weak actions are futile. These actions only make us look weaker, and if anything, they laugh at how pathetically helpless the Muslim world is. I'm sure it must be a coffee joke for them as to how we're so deluded that we believe a little boycott of ours will stop them or be an obstacle in their plan. 

Fact is, Israel IS going to attack Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and maybe even Iran, with the US' support. And no matter what you pansies do, it ain't gonna stop them. They're funded by the world's ELITE. It's a plan in motion which they - the Zions - came up with when half of you boycott-folks didn't even exist as sperm drops on this planet. All that is happening in the world today was set in motion ages ago. We're on the brink of WW3. 

So, to the weak hypocrites that make up this boycott brigade: you can shove your boycott where the sun doesn't shine. 99.9% of you hypocrites are those who preach ""boycott"" all day but will be the first ones to hop on a plane to the US or Europe if offered a visa. A farce of a boycott it is. What kind of a boycott is it that it's so frickin selective? Matlab apne Apple iphones aur Macs boycott kar nai sakte na apne Windows laptops par brands ka boycott karwa lo inse. Kehte hain boycott karo aur local pe shift ho. Local companies aisi jinhe jab se pata laga hai k awaam shift horahi hai, na he unhu ne foran rates increase kiye balke even quality na maintain kar paye. Ye toh haal hai is mulk k musalmaano ka 😂🤣 Gaza fatah karenge ye munafik! HAHAHAHAHAHA 😂

Bohat se toh isme woh hain jo apne complexes ko satisfy kar rahe hain is boycott k banner k neeche rehte huay, especially aaj kal jinka dhanda hai k kfc wagera main andar ghuso aur jo loug bethay hain andar unhe ganda karo. Acha, hogaya? Fatah hogaya Gaza? Lanat hai aise munafikon pe jinka boycott bas apne ego ko satisfy karne ki hadh tak hai. 

I can bet that you pathetic hypocrites (the boycott brigade) are such scumbags who watch porn all night and preach boycott all day. Wait, do you watch halal porn or what? Is your porn as selective as your boycott? It's just disgusting how your myopic minds function. Makes me wanna barf at your helplessness. You losers can't do anything substantial for the problems in your own backyard but expect to defeat Israel 😂 the irony! 

Had we as a nation had it in us, our army would've been in Gaza right now! But that isn't the case, is it? Like Saudi ka MBS tak Israel se cooperate kar raha hai. Saudi k against b kuch karo na ab? Wait, visa chahiye? 🤣😂🤣

Tum boycott waalon k liye yeh hukumat best hai wese. Tum saare wahi ho jo aik army ka danda parhne k baad dubara nazar nai aate. Itna he is qoum main himmat aur jazba hota toh aaj IK bahar na hota? Hahahaha lanat hai tumhaare weak actions pe. Aur ye tumhaara pathetic, deluded holier-than-thou boycott jo loug kar nai rahe unpe apni jahilana soch ko impose karna band kar do.

My big sister, on the other hand, was the opposite but with similar values and we got along well and were friends at the time. My big sister was extremely socially adept, respected among our peers, involved in the greek community, and even served as a recruitment counselor for sorority recruitment. Even I looked up to her and respected her at the time though she is 11 months younger than me and now looking back years later did not really respect me. However, I remembered years later that she made some patronizing and condescending comments about me such as, ""I remind her of olaf from frozen"", ""You're so socially awkward and I love it"", ""Nothing ever upsets you"". She would also call me demeaning names such as ""sweetie"" and ""hon"". I will admit I did carry myself in that way during our college years. We were friends up until 2017 and did not have any contact up until 2019.

In these 2 years between 2017 to 2019, my personality significantly changed. I became much more serious, able to have a strong B.S detector, very socially adept and able to have a sophisticated conversation with people, and able to stand up for myself and take good care of myself. I really feel like my colleagues at work really respect me.

In November 2019, I texted my big sister after over 2 years of not talking to her at first trying to as civilized as possible bringing to her attention her demeaning comments towards me. I asked if we could meet up for coffee or have a phone call about this, She completely dismissed my concerns and redirect out conversation via text. She even made some B.S comment about ""We all get caught up in our 9-5 and are very busy that we have very little time for many people"". I didn't respond for about 2 weeks. It then hit me and I got very upset. I then send her this long confrontational text message about how she is extremely arrogant, condescending, dismissive, a horrible friend, and patronizing she is, especially with the comments she texted me. She later responded, ""When you want to misinterpret what I say and put words in my mouth, it's not a conversation, it's just you talking. Seriously chill"". Did not respond after that and I removed her from my IG follow list and then she blocked my IG account(I know very petty). After that, a whole chunk of her friends and a few people from our sorority unfollowed me on IG. There was no contact from November 2019 to February 2025.

In February of last month, I was doing some pring cleaning and found the paddle she made me for initiation day as well as a letter she wrote me when I graduated college. I decided to reach out to her explaining all of these and what prompted me to reach out. I also wanted to get some answers and insight. I send her a text message, and while I did not apologize or admit wrong doing, I asked to have a phone call just to talk over our last interaction.I even asked her to le me know if she did not want to so I could have an answer and I would respect that. No response from her.

I switch tabs and the launcher ponders the meaning of existence. I click the shop, and it takes a coffee break. I finish a game and am met with a loading screen so eternal, it once waited for me to finish a 10-hour shift and still wasn’t ready.

In 2020, there was hope. A ""Cleanup Campaign,"" they called it. But now?  
It feels worse. Slower. Heavier. Like it's been carrying the weight of every unfulfilled dev promise since Season 5.

One would think a multi-billion dollar company could fix a launcher, right?  
But alas—we live in a world where it’s more profitable to sell skins than to patch the damn foundation.

This isn’t just our beloved company. This is capitalism in ultra-high definition:  
Where “player-first” means “revenue-first,” and dev resources go where the profit margins are, not where the problems live.

1juto5e,https://youtube.com/shorts/rdP2TMA2mB4?si=THASH7eT09UBs4TZ,sumire ceremonial grade matcha benefits,"A matcha latte is a delicious and vibrant beverage that combines the smooth, creamy texture of steamed milk with the earthy, slightly bitter taste of matcha, a finely ground powder made from specially grown green tea leaves. Unlike traditional lattes, which use espresso, a matcha latte is crafted using matcha, which has a unique, rich flavor profile due to its distinct processing and high antioxidant content.

Matcha itself is made from shade-grown tea leaves, which are carefully dried and ground into a fine powder. This process preserves the vibrant green color and high concentration of nutrients, including L-theanine, which is believed to provide a calming effect. The combination of matcha and milk offers a balanced taste—earthy yet slightly sweet, with the natural umami of matcha complemented by the creaminess of milk, whether it’s whole, almond, oat, or any preferred alternative.

The preparation of a matcha latte starts with whisking matcha powder with hot water, creating a smooth and frothy mixture. This matcha concentrate is then poured into a cup, and steamed milk is gently added. The result is a frothy, smooth drink with a beautiful green hue, often topped with a thin layer of foam.

A matcha latte is not just a visually appealing beverage but also offers numerous health benefits. Packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, matcha is known for boosting metabolism, enhancing focus, and providing a steady, sustained energy boost without the jitteriness that sometimes accompanies caffeine from coffee.

Overall, a matcha latte is a flavorful, nourishing, and energizing alternative to traditional coffee-based drinks, offering a sophisticated, well-rounded taste that appeals to both tea lovers and those looking to explore new ways to enjoy caffeine.

Media similar to what I'm looking for:
 
1. A tavern for tea - A game where you play as the owner of a fantasy tavern and serve tea to a hero and villain who are tired of playing their respective roles. 

2. The tea dragon society - A cute comic about dragons who grow tea on their bodies when they're cared for. Drinking the tea allows you to relive the memories stored in them.

3. Coffee Talk - (let's ignore the coffee bit of the title) A game set in modern day Seattle, except fantasy races like elves, vampires and dwarves live among humans. You play as the owner of a coffee shop that only opens at night. You serve drinks to the various customers and learn their stories.

I’m looking to connect with someone in the sales field who’d be open to chatting or hopping on a quick call. I’m early in my journey and really believe in the power of mentorship - but I’ve been missing that kind of guidance in my life.

I know everyone is busy, but if you’re someone who’s been in sales for a while and wouldn’t mind sharing some advice or answering a few questions, I’d really appreciate your time. If you’re local to SoCal, I’d love to treat you to coffee or lunch as a small thank-you.


Feel free to DM me if you’re open to connecting! And thank very much 🙌🏼",2,1744160504.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False
1jutm52,https://v.redd.it/bnjby2ujkpte1,"Changed gasket and screen, this is my backflow"," V1. New Rancilio head gasket arrived today.  When I first recovered this machine 3 weeks ago I attempted a backflow and it leaked and not a lot came out of the drain. Today I placed the new gasket in lettering side down, flat side toward portafilter and attached the new screen.  Spent a long time removing all the stuck on remnants from the old gasket and cleaned it really well. Soaked the gasket in hot water for a minute before installing. It’s an OEM V1 gasket from Espressoparts. I was very optimistic when I attached the portafilter with the blind basket. It’s never gone on so smoothly and actually tightened farther than usual. With a tsp of cleaner inside the basket I attempted the backflow as seen on Seattle Coffee Gear’s YouTube tutorial.  After the 3rd flush, this was the result and kept being the result. Not a ton of fluid came out of the drain before the leaking occurred , but I did have some success getting cleaner through the drain before the leaking began. Once it started leaking no backflow occurred.
What am I missing? 
Forgive my messy machine. Cleaned it really well after shooting this. 
Thanks for your help.
Peace and Love

1jutl6y,https://i.redd.it/6s0a4m5ckpte1.jpeg,Congratulations your day was mostly fat,"Can someone pls teach her macros bc obvs SK doesn’t. 
The macro breakdown for this “meal plan” 

Macro Percentages:
	•	Protein: 376 / 1,519 = ~24.7%
	•	Fat: 834.75 / 1,519 = ~54.9%
	•	Carbs: 302 / 1,519 = ~19.9%

And this does not include the coffee she showed off on IG today nor all the ketones. 
What I see is she’s eating more fat than protein which will not promote muscle growth and her carbs are too low. 
She’s on the bullet train of f’g up her metabolism. 
She will notice that in about ten years.

This is an absolute goldmine now that the major averages have plummeted to April 2024 lows. 

Look for stuff that’s -75% or more. Great practice and it’s so easy with a hard copy. I’ll be looking myself, but the exercise would be good for the group.

I'm in dire need of help due to the economic crisis that we are facing here in Argentina. I live in Buenos Aires and have a full time job, with 12 years of experience and had 2 promotions, but even with that, I’m increasingly unable to pay rent for my single room apartment.

Back in January, my rent almost quadrupled in price, and my salary has barely grown while everything has raised considerably in price. Just paying rent and the basic services eats up more than 70% of my whole salary. I have cut costs as much as possible and even gotten used to having only one meal a day and just a few snacks and coffee during the day, but it's still not enough.

Today I had to cancel my treatment for ADHD, I spent a lot of money and time getting it diagnosed and getting some tests so I could be prescribed the medication, so it pains me greatly to cancel it, since this is something that has held me back my whole life and I’m starting to feel it's finally getting better. But the price of the medicine and my psychiatrist is simply impossible for me to keep paying at this moment.

At this rate, every month the debt in my credit card is getting bigger, so I’m afraid I’ll soon won't be able to pay the minimum and will get in serious trouble. I have no idea when or if I’ll get a raise soon, so I definitely need some help to stay afloat until this gets better.

I'm about 1000$ in debt with my credit card now, so any amount that can help me reach that would be greatly appreciated, I can receive it through Paypal.

But I’m also offering my services as a Creative Writer and Community Manager. I have ample experience in both, and for the latter, I even have a great track record here on Reddit as a moderator as you can see in my profile.

At this point, I’m desperate, so any help is welcomed. Thanks for reading me out.",0,1744160395.0,Assistance,1,0.4,False

So I'd been seeing a woman for about 2 months, very brief time I admit. Things had been going incredibly well, had our first ""official"" date after many little coffee/lunch dates. Had an amazing time, first kiss, called each other and talked all the way home. Next day we lamented that we had to work and couldn't hang out. She said she had ""all the feels""...anyway...all the good stuff. She's (43f) and separated for 3.5 years. I'm (45m) and divorced myself. Early on we spoke about priorities in life and she made it very clear hers was her children...I completely understand, I have a kid too who is my world. She just re-entered the dating world after taking a year away and I was the first person she dated. I guess to try to keep this short, despite that things were going EXTREMELY well, we had found less and less time to be able to hang out and she told me that ""maybe she's not in a place in life to be dating anyone and that waiting around for us to find a few nights wasn't fair to me."" I said I completely understood where her priorities lay and that I was fine with taking things slowly, she thanked me for my patience and talked about getting together later that weekend. Fast forward 3 days...hadn't heard a peep from her, no calls, no texts, nothing and then we have a call and she said again that she's not in a place in life to be in a relationship right now an is prioritizing reconnecting with her friends, fitness, getting back in touch with her own body, health, therapy, and of course kids (keep in mind she is a breast cancer survivor - double mastectomy with reconstruction and hysterectomy in the last 2.5 years). I again said I was comfortable taking things as slowly as she needed. Again, heard nothing for three days, then today I texted and said we should get together for coffee since this is something she said we should do on our last phone call. She said that wouldn't be a good idea. I asked what had changed over the course of the last 5 days. She said ""I don't need to justify that I'm not interested."" I said I understood, said it was great getting to know her and wished her the best. She did say early on that she's an Avoidant Attachment style person and has a tendency to run, in fact when we first started dating her therapist was excited for her and said they needed to focus on breaking those patterns of running. I know this is dense, as am I apparently so anything you've got is welcomed. I've just never been in a situation where it turns SO fast.",1,1744160337.0,relationship_advice,8,0.67,False
