I like the usual stuff like movies, TV shows, reading, bit of writing of my own, some baking.

Then everything else goes to bills, gas, groceries, household needs, prescriptions, repairs, savings, investments, etc. 

Anyway, is there something weird or wrong with this? I had mentioned it in another sub and got downvoted. But I made sure to explain it was an equal thing we both agreed upon.

Been managing it for years, mostly with Acyclovir, taking it regularly at first, then switching to only when I felt an outbreak coming on (around 5 times a year). That worked well enough, but I hated carrying around those stupid chalky pills everywhere.

One day, my neighbor saw them in my pocket and gave me 'that look'‚Äîyou know the one. I kinda laughed it off, but a week later, the dude shows up at my office with a small box and this bottle of clear liquid inside. We grabbed a coffee, and he told me he also had HSV and that one of his students (he is a prof in Marine science) did a report on an algae, *Porphyridium*.  Apparently, this microalga makes some bioactive compounds that mess with the virus. 

His student grew a batch, applied it, and swore it helped. My neighbor figured, why not? He tried it and claimed his outbreaks just stopped. Then he handed me the bottle and said, ‚ÄúYour turn.‚Äù

This was in 2023. Since then, I‚Äôve had the occasional ""tingle"", but I just spray it on my... parts... and nothing develops. No sores, no full outbreak, just... nothing.

I have no clue why this stuff isn‚Äôt more well known, he called it *Porphyridium Conditioned Media*. If you‚Äôre dealing with the same thing, might be worth looking into. It's out there.   

Below are multiple papers on it.  If there is interest I will find more.  Happy to talk about it:

1ikagh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1ikagh0/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

We had been friends for years and old colleagues. M and F (29)

I know we're both single and looking for people and both on the apps and we never had a romantic vibe before but I was into it. Nothing sexual happened that night and we just cuddled and slept together and kissed a couple times and it was a sweet night. The next day he made me coffee and drove me home and I suggested we should go on a real date sometime and he said yes.

I didn't hear from him at all via text but ran into him through work circles a few days later where the conversation was friendly and he said that we should grab drinks the upcoming weekend or next.  
I had to travel the following week and I still hadn't gotten a text from him so I decided to just text him. We agreed to hang when I came back, followed up when I got back but then he got sick and couldn't that weekend. But just to gauge his interest level, I sent a nice text suggesting that I did have a really great time last time and I wanted to do it again when he was up for it. He loved the message.

Also I talked to a couple friends who know him and they all thought he was interested given that he's a pretty direct person and would have told me if he wasn't feeling it.

So finally, I just wanted to get some clarity. I knew we were going to be at the same event coming up so I brought up at the end of the night how he was feeling about things since it's been a couple weeks since the friendship boundary crossed. He subsequently told me he didn't want to date me and he didn't think I was compatible at all and he thought it was a one night thing and that I knew that. He also said it shouldn't be a big deal since we didn't have sex and that he ""never got a vibe"" I liked him like that though he values our friendship.

I then told him it was messed up that he couldn't just be direct and honest the next morning and that if he valued the friendship, he would've respected me enough to do that. I also said I felt like he had led me on for weeks and that I felt a little hurt by the situation.

I then heard he told a mutual friend he felt like he didn't handle his response to me well and wanted to reach out eventually, but I'm not holding my breath here.

At 0534 I finally stood up after 10 mins intervals of ‚Äû5 more minutes‚Äú beginning from 0400. After a shower I felt ok, but tired. Nothing a coffee can‚Äôt fix. Also, my mind said just go to work place and meditate there, because I only wanted to do a 20 min meditation anyway. So I did.  
0547 at work place.   
**0550 - 0612: find present moment**  
As soon as I started the meditation and closed my eyes, I started to smile automatically. I noticed this some seconds later and I was like ‚Äûyeah right. I am alive. I have a job. I am healthy. Why wouldn't I be grateful and smile?‚Äú.  
This smile might be a tiny thing if you look at it, but for me it is actually a major breakthrough. Imagine every time you feel like shit and your body still reminds of  to smile and be grateful instead?  
How would your life be if you would do this automatically?  
And if you smile and are grateful when you feel like shit, how would you feel like and think when you feel really good? Majestic.  
**0614 - 2025: work**  
**2039 sleep, while listening to to BOTEC 1**  
Today I didn‚Äôt do anything, apart of a 20 min meditation, but I got seriously zero time to do anything else, so I will keep the streak going as if nothing happened and +1 meditation.  
**2200** Still awake, because of thoughts about work.  
**2230** still awake, thinking ""working for two more hours would have been more efficient.""  
However, I am not allowed to work longer than 13 hrs per day on a regular basis  
**2251** still awake and actually thinking about, which tasks I could do right now if I go back to work lol. I started to stretch in bed instead.  
While stretching my mind tries to think positively ‚Äûwell, maybe I just need way less sleep now since I meditate so often‚Äú  
**2329 sleep and fell asleep.**  
\------------------------------------------------------  
**06.02.2025 - Thursday**  
**0400** wake up. and sleep until 0430  
**0445 - 0526: Find present moment, twice**  
**0546 - 2147**: Work  
**2154** sleep  
\------------------------------------------------------  
**07.02.2025 - Friday**  
Woke up at 0400, but kept ob sleeping until 0550  
**0620 - 1551:** Work  
Long shower until 1618  
**1622 - 1658:** sleep  
**1659 - 1719:** Find present moment  
**1720 - 1825:** BOTEC 3 + gratitude  
During the meditations I had many thoughts and I moved around a lot, but the end I began to smile for no reason. So instead of lying down for 10 mins after BOTEC, I listened to a gratitude meditation for 10 mins.

Today I just wanted to chill and waste time doing nothing since I worked so much this week. I actually was thinking that all my progress from meditating during Bangkok went to waste, because the first 2 weeks of work were shit. But since I smiled for no reason at the end of todays BOTEC meditation, I know there is still progress going on.  
And actually its good that I can enjoy watching animes now and don't feed bad about it, because I could watch a lot of ""Dragon Ball Super"" episodes, to finally finish watching this anime and don't be compelled to watch them when I actually want to meditate.

**1:35** sleep

**Fast, short and very effective NLP techniques**

**Italian love**

* See, hear or feel that negative thought/ picture / voice appear in your mind and give it some Italian love with a back hand slap.
* Then see that negative thought cry, while holding its slapped cheek, run back into its room, close the door and staying in its room forever.
* Which of your future negative thoughts would you like to give some Italian love?

**Sexy Strobes or Catch & Choke (not sure which name is better haha)**

* When a thought/ image/ sound occurs in your mind, grab it in your mind.
* And if you like it rough, choke that f\*\*\*er like you would choke a BDSM fetishist.
* Then shrink it down to the size of a penny and let it blink black and white extremely fast and say ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt"" (like machine gun fire) in your mind or out loud.
* Finally, throw it way back into the distance, until it disappears completely and lights up like a shining star/ dot at the end of the universe.
* Like in Pokemon, where the bad guys get blown away into the distance.
* Now, how much of your negative future shit can you catch & choke & let it blink black and white in the next minute?

**Cultured Catch (same as Catch & Choke just less sexy and for prude people only) (I'm kidding)**

* Grab that thought and throw it way into the distance or hit that thought with a baseball bat from the get-go
* see it explode like fireworks on New Year's Eve and
* know now that these fireworks are shining bright in celebration of you
* having already banished your old self from your current life and
* your new self has already emerged and is already stabilizing in your new life right now.
* PS: I'm not kidding.

**Banana Boss**

* I forgot the instructions, so I will write how this played out for me. This will be enough for you to visualize it yourself.
* Picture a naggy boss/ wife/ husband or whomever is being naggy with you.
* As the person gets naggy notice 8 mischievous monkeys jumping out of the next room or corner and coming into his direction.
* Now, how many monkeys do you need to order on amazon prime now to re-adjust how you see some people at your environments?
* NEVER EVER tell the other person or anybody else that you did picture this.
* It might hurt the other persons feelings and it won't be good for your relationship.
* One monkey jumps him at puts a banana in his mouth.
* Two monkeys shove a chain, made out of bananas, over his head.
* Three monkeys throw one banana each onto him and he begins to juggle them bananas.
* One monkey strikes the ground with his whip ordering him to dance in a circle, while juggling the bananas.
* One monkey jumps on one of your shoulders and touches you with his elbow like bro and says ""This a\*\*hole. Look how stupid he looks"" while laughing and pointing at him.

1ikaa8q,https://i.redd.it/5mackdnt7the1.jpeg,"Looking for a really comfortable lightweight leather jacket- Schott, Iron Heart, Master Supply Co or Thursday","I have been looking for a new leather jacket for awhile. I don‚Äôt want anything heavy weight, overly stiff or artificially distressed. Ideally, I‚Äôd love something rich and buttery but tough enough to be wesr for years and get better with time. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the sweet spot that many of us are looking for. In the past, I have purchased several horsehide jacket and as amazing as they are, they were just too heavy to wear enough to justify the cost. I also live in Texas so it‚Äôs not nearly as cold most of the year as compared the Chicago or NYC. So I‚Äôm definitely for a jacket in lighter weight category but definitely something tougher than a lambskin jacket. My initial thoughts are  cowhide, calfskin, deerskin, or buffalo‚Ä¶.

One jacket that I‚Äôm considering is a Schott 613 in lightweight Horween oiled cowhide. It has the heritage of both Schott and Horween. Both names are synonymous with quality and have an unmatched history. I like the rich brown leather in this particular jacket, however I‚Äôm not certain if the brass hardware will look overly flashy in person.

The other jacket I‚Äôve been considering is an Iron Heart Deerskin jacket. It‚Äôs a classic black leather and a bit more low key than the Schott. I don‚Äôt know a lot about deer in jackets but in footwear, I‚Äôve always been impressed with its softness and strength in such a lightweight leather. I currenkt own an M65 jacket by Iron Heart so I know they make very quality stuff however, the IH is a few hundred more than Schott. 

While these jackets are at the top of my list they both top $1000. I realize that you pay for what you get, still I figured it worth looking into some other options. 

I recently saw one of the ‚Äúbootfluencers‚Äù that I follow wearing a Master Supply Co jacket. He wears a field jacket and I‚Äôve been really impressed with the patina his jacket has developed after a few months of hard and consistent use. I personally like the Goldrush jacket which has a unique western vibe. This jacket is definitely cheaper but I don‚Äôt know a lot about Master Supply Co other than their slick website.

The last jacket I wanted to throw in the ring is a Thursday leather jacket I recently saw on IG. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even know that Thursday made jackets. The ad I saw showed some impressive Patina. The website doesn‚Äôt really go into detail about the leather itself, other than stating that it‚Äôs Black¬†Coffee Hand-Finished Full-Grain Leather. I assume that means it‚Äôs a brown leather jacket jacket with some black dye applied. I also dig the black hardware, def less flashy. The reviews on the website are certainly stellar.

Schott - Made in USA - $1000
Iron Heart - Made in Scotland - $1200
Master Supply Co - Made in Pakistan - $566
Thursday - Unknown - $360

Website doesn‚Äôt state where the jacket was made. It states it was ‚Äòmade with integrity,‚Äô so it was possibly made is Mexico or Italy?

Does anyone have any insights into these jackets or have additional thoughts? Would appreciate any guidance the group could offer.",2,1738974439.0,leatherjacket,3,1.0,False

1ika80m,https://i.redd.it/gnpen0va7the1.jpeg,40% LDL drop no Statin!,"39/m I‚Äôm not anti-statin at all but wanted to see what drastic diet changes would be capable of. 

For the record previously I ate like crap lots of fast food, not much veggies and fruits and overall just not great. 

Blood test in October came back 5.23 mmol/L or for my American friends 202 mg/dl to 122! Full 180 on my diet and started working out again 3 days a week. I wasn‚Äôt perfect, didn‚Äôt track everything to the gram but tried to not exceed 10g saturated fats a day. Did not include saturated fats from nuts, oils or guac in that 10g number. Here‚Äôs the breakdown of what I tried to consistently do 

Consistently:
- steel cut oats little bit of brown sugar, protein shake and black coffee for breakfast(without fail this was every morning)
- Metamucil 3x a day(religiously up until 3 weeks ago and then pretty much 2 times a day average no less than 1, life got busy)
- Mixed veggies every meal
- Fruit every meal 1 apple min a day, then mix in strawberries and others
- Trailmix 
- Chicken more often both meals 
- Turkey chilli is amazing I add jalape√±os  (https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/seriously-the-best-healthy-turkey-chili/)
- Snack banana and walnuts
- Occasional salmon or shrimp
- Spinach oil and vinegar salad
- We do pizza movie night every Friday as a family so I‚Äôd have 2 pieces max
- I cut red meat out almost entirely. I had 3 steaks over that period of time
- Cut out butter and only had 0% fat fairlife milk with Honey Nut Cheerios as a snack 
- Cut out all cheese except that 2 slices of pizza
- Whole wheat Tostitos and guac as a snack
- Cut out bread except occasional wrap to make buffalo chicken wrap 
- Think you get the picture but lastly took 1200mg citrus bergamot and 500mg berberine about 80% of the days. I‚Äôd forget at times 

I‚Äôm surprised my HDL dropped too, anyone shed light on that at all?

- ‚ÄúTara kape?‚Äù And suddenly, you‚Äôre in a caf√© you‚Äôve never been to.
- ‚ÄúGutom ka?‚Äù Next thing you know, you‚Äôre on a mission to find the best ramen in the city.
- ‚ÄúTara workout?‚Äù But somehow, it turns into a philosophical discussion about life choices.

If that‚Äôs your vibe, we might just get along.

About Me:
- A psychology major who occasionally overanalyzes things, including but not limited to why people prefer sitting in certain spots at caf√©s.
- A firm believer that coffee is essential, but I won‚Äôt judge you if you prefer tea‚Äîjust know that I‚Äôll always pick the strongest brew.
- Spontaneity is my default setting. A random craving? A sudden urge to go for a walk? Count me in.
- Trying to be that person who works out regularly, but mostly succeeding at talking about working out. Running, badminton, or anything that doesn‚Äôt require too much coordination is fair game.
- Enjoys conversations that start with ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù and somehow end with ‚ÄúDo you think we‚Äôre in a simulation?‚Äù
- A PC, Ps5, Switch and VR gamer. 

What I‚Äôm Looking For:
- Friends who enjoy unplanned adventures, whether it‚Äôs discovering a new caf√©, going on a food trip, or simply taking a long walk while discussing life.
- Someone who actually enjoys having conversations beyond the usual ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù‚Äîbecause deep talks are underrated.
- A workout buddy who doesn‚Äôt take things too seriously. If you‚Äôre up for a jog or a casual game of something, I‚Äôm in.
- People who understand that good friendships don‚Äôt need constant updates‚Äîsometimes, you just pick up where you left off.
- Preferably someone older than me as I connect/relate to them more. Someone who's open to a two-way exchange of perspectives. 

If any of this sounds like your kind of thing, send a message or drop a comment. Who knows? This might just be the start of an unexpectedly great friendship.

I (17F) live with my mom (40F) and grandma (65F), who moved in 10 years ago after an eviction. She has Alzheimer‚Äôs from a TBI but is still capable of taking care of herself. Despite this, she never respects my privacy‚Äîconstantly going through my room and moving things. My mom has confronted her multiple times, but nothing changes.

I have severe hyperhidrosis and finally found a deodorant that works. It costs $16 and is only sold at one store in town. I bought a new one yesterday, used it before school, and left it on the coffee table in a rush. When I got home, I didn‚Äôt think about it until my mom threw away the empty box, reminding me to grab it. But when I looked, it was gone. I searched everywhere‚Äîmy room, the bathroom, the living room‚Äînothing.

Then I noticed my room had been ransacked again‚Äîdresser drawers open, clothes on the floor. I know I left it neat before school. At that point, I lost it. I started yelling, demanding to know where my deodorant was and why my room had been messed with. My grandma yelled back, called me crazy, and even threatened to have me committed. My mom calmed me down and agreed she probably took it but said I escalated the situation too far.

My aunt came to take my grandma away to cool off, and now my cousins and aunt are calling me an AH for flipping out over deodorant. But it‚Äôs not about the deodorant‚Äîit‚Äôs about my grandma constantly violating my privacy and stealing things. She‚Äôs done this before, accusing me of hiding drugs when all I had was ibuprofen and prescriptions, and even tearing apart my room looking for a dildo that never existed.

I‚Äôve told my mom for years that she needs to move my grandma into a nursing home, but she won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just so sick of my privacy being violated. AITAH?

1ika0qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ika0qb/pennies_went_from_lucky_to_my_worst_nightmare/,Pennies went from lucky to my worst nightmare,"""You've got to be kidding,"" I said to myself after taking a drink of my coffee, which had the metallic taste of copper. I slammed my mug down on my kitchen table and was met with the sound of clanking metal against the side of the cup. I knew what was in the mug but felt too frustrated to acknowledge or think about it.

 

After a moment, I looked back at the mug. I realized it was getting absurd to have these kinds of emotions and even fear for something like this.

 

I grabbed my now cold cup of coffee and dumped it into the sink. Two pennies came flying out, hitting the edge of the kitchen sink. The sound of metal hitting metal bounced in my head like a haunting lullaby.

 

Something as harmless as a penny was slowly becoming my biggest fear. What is normally seen as lucky had become the thing that would taunt me day and night.

 

After letting my rage subside I grabbed the pennies out of the drain. Quickly walking to the nearby living room and throwing them on top of a monstrous pile of pennies currently living rent-free on my carpet. The pile mocked me. I felt so defeated. No matter what I did, more pennies just kept showing up. In stranger and stranger places. It was just weird at first, but now I can't even enjoy something as small as my cup of coffee. What did I do to ever deserve this strange curse?

 

How many pennies would you have to find before you started to feel uncomfortable? Five? Ten? Maybe Fifty? And what would you even do about it? Maybe tell a friend? There isn't much you could do about it really. Just feel oddly concerned as to how you suddenly are a penny magnet.

 

I've always been the kind of person to pick up change I see on the ground in random places. I have a little jar that I put all the loose change in and put it all in one of those little coin machines every so often to exchange for larger bills or gift cards or whatever. It always felt satisfying to see the dollar amount on the dial screen. Like a small reward for always having an eye out for those little shiny coins.

 

It's hard to say when it went from feeling like I was lucky to feeling like something was plaguing me. I remember about a year ago, going to put a handful of pennies into the jar. I had the thought of it being out of the ordinary to have so many pennies and when I looked at the jar, I realized it was almost all pennies. It was a large jar and I remembered emptying it just a few weeks back, yet, it was filled to the brim with pennies. I took it by a coin-counting machine on my way to work and was amazed. Despite it only being pennies, it was just over $100. I was more excited than confused at that moment.

 

My excitement from making money from random coins quickly shifted. What was once finding them on the floor of my house or a cup holder in my car became finding them in the sock I'd been wearing all day. Or clogging up the shower drain. In my phone case and even in a chicken nugget. Thankfully I noticed before trying to swallow.

 

I would tell people in my life about it and they would laugh and think it's nothing until they saw it happen first hand. It wasn't just something that would happen in my house. It happened everywhere I went. I got in trouble at work because I kept having to dig pennies out of my computer. My coworkers got annoyed they kept finding pennies in the coffee pot and sitting in the break room fridge. Even pennies showing up on their desks. They thought I was pulling a prank and got very annoyed after I wouldn't stop and it only got worse.

 

My friends would come over to see jars and buckets full of pennies that I collected over the last week or so that I hadn't had the time to take in. They would leave after the frustration of pennies showing up in their water or underwear. They somehow thought I was doing it. The thought of a penny curse was just too strange to believe. I wouldn't believe it either.

 

Life was still moving. Despite the inconveniences that now followed me around, I managed to keep my job and keep most of my friends. Plus, I was making decent money from this. Unfortunately, the pennies became more desperate for attention just as I was getting used to them‚Ä¶

 

A couple months back I got a call from my brother-in-law. My sister had unexpectedly passed away overnight. I was in complete shock. She was young and healthy. What could've possibly killed her?

 

They carried out a postmortem and I couldn't believe what they found. A penny. A damn penny. Lodged in her brain. The doctor couldn't even believe it himself when he told us.

 

""Even though we have decided that the penny was the cause of death, we unfortunately have no idea how it got there. I understand she has no history of surgery on her brain or anywhere near her head. No event that could've possibly led to a coin being introduced. We saw in her record that she had an MRI a few years back for a concussion and they didn't see a coin. It somehow made its way there in the last couple of years. She should've shown signs if something was logged for a long time."" He paused and moved in his chair trying to get more comfortable but only looked more awkward as he scooted. ""It almost seems like it appeared overnight‚Ä¶I know you want a better explanation for the loss of a family member, but something like this has never happened before. There really isn't a great explanation. I'm-I'm so sorry.""

 

The fluorescent light flickered in the cold doctor's office as my family and I exchanged glances at each other. I felt a deep pit in my stomach. I killed my sister. This was all my fault. I didn't directly stick that coin in her head, but whatever was responsible for the coins wasn't happy with the torture it had brought just me so far.

 

I knew it wouldn't take long for my family to start to blame me. I was already blaming myself, I just sat in anticipation as I waited for the whole family to point fingers at me.

 

""Andrew, what have you done?"" My mom whispered in a hoarse voice.

 

""No please, believe me, It didn't have anything to do with me! How on earth would I be able to do something like this on purpose!"" I begged my family as the doctor felt more uncomfortable than ever.

 

""I'm not saying you put that coin in her brain. But whatever is happening to you is now hurting the rest of us. I know you didn't do this on purpose, but I think we should keep our distance until you can figure this out."" My mom said with tear-filled eyes that wouldn't meet mine.

 

""Okay, okay, everyone needs to slow down here."" The doctor added nervously. ""What is this about Andrew being to blame? I need some more explanation."" He said as he unclenched his fist to find two pennies perfectly waiting in his palm. ""W-wait? What the hell? How did you do that? What is happening?"" He stood up in his chair and started to find pennies hiding in his clothes. He frantically grabbed three out of his pants pockets and threw them to the ground. Then one in his jacket pocket. Finally taking off his shoe and dumping one onto his desk. The poor man went running out of the office.

 

""Andrew, please understand why we need our space. You saw Katie the night before she passed. We aren't saying you did this on purpose but-"" my dad stated as I interrupted him.

 

""No, stop, I'll leave."" I wanted to argue. I didn't want my family to abandon me, but they were right. It was unsafe for me to be around them. I was causing coins to randomly spawn near me. In a proximity that I couldn't be sure of. One thing was clear. They only appeared when I was close by. I could only keep my loved ones safe by staying away. Until I could hopefully figure out what was causing this to happen.

 

I left the doctor's office in a hurry. I felt frantic heading for my house. I knew I had to barricade myself in my house. It was hopefully far enough away from other homes or people that I wouldn't endanger anyone else. Only time would tell.

 

I was in complete solitude. Acting as if I had some kind of infectious disease that I was desperate to not spread to any unfortunate soul. Even going to the extent of quitting my job, I couldn't risk the lives of my coworkers. Despite how annoying they could be. Plus, I was making so much money from the damn pennies I didn't have to work. I bought about ten of those five-gallon reusable water jugs you see people filling up at the grocery store. They would get me an average of $400 per jug and I had about three jugs per week, money was no issue. I put them at the end of my driveway and hired someone to take them to the coin exchange. They would bring the cash from it back to the end of the driveway and that's the money I've been living off of. Luckily, being around the pennies themselves doesn't seem to hurt anyone. It's me that's the problem.

 

Coming to terms with this being my new normal was hard but I settled in. I kept trying to figure out how this was happening but was only met with dead ends.

 

The main way I was staying sane was by trying to find a way out of this, but nothing. I was only met with more and more pennies. It felt like I was drowning in them. They consumed me. Not being able to take a bite of food without spitting out a little copper coin. Needing to rake them out of my bed several times a night just to be comfortable enough to sleep. The laundry machine would sound like a war zone with pieces of tiny metal flying around inside of it. I could hear the sound of them in my walls as they fell on top of a bigger pile of pennies within the drywall.

 

My time was now spent with me cleaning up pennies. Filling up countless water jugs and buckets with them in an attempt to not have my home overtaken by them.

 

I am writing this because I believe this is the end for me. Not only is all this happening to my home but to me. I went to scratch my wrist yesterday and my heart dropped as I grabbed it. A small round bump made its way out of my skin. The indent of a penny making itself known in my body. It was happening. The same end that came for my sister. I knew having a penny in my arm wouldn't be nearly as dangerous as the one that found its way into my sister's head, but this was the beginning. I could see this penny, but where were the other ones I couldn't see? Burrowing their way into my organs and nerves.

 

This morning I woke up in much worse shape than I could have imagined. Multiple pennies protruding from my arms. Not just those, but I have severe pain in random places in my body. The inside of my knee, my ear, and I think, my lung. I felt a sudden gut-wrenching pain in my mouth and looked in the mirror to find a penny lodged in the side of my gum.

 

As I lay in my bed writing this, I'm quite literally being consumed by pennies. They are covering my body at the same time they are infiltrating my body. Every hour I feel more and more random pinches of pain appear, knowing I am closer and closer to death. Now it's a waiting game to see if the weight of the copper on top of my body kills me first or if a coin shows up in just the right spot in my body to kill me once and for all.

I have a crush on my co-worker. He is conventionally very attractive but not really my personal type at all. However, we got along super well from the beginning and we got close for co-workers really fast, like he started ‚Äùopening up‚Äù to me and in the beginning I thought it was a bit strange but soon it started feeling natural and I followed as well with sharing personal things. And I knew from the beginning that he was taken and had a child but I soon realized that I am starting to really crush on him hard (and you know its bad when its based on their personality and not looks loll). However, I would NEVER EVER do anything about this crush, but it is so frustratingg. Especially cause I know that he really likes my company and me as a person. And I started noticing that I kinda started stopping by at work to get coffee when I am off (we work at a Caf√©) to see him, but when I realized this I immediately took a step back and reminded myself that he is taken, I cant be doing things like this. But he is making it so difficult cause every time I go to the Caf√© when he is working he takes a break and we drink our coffee together and he is so excited about it as well when he sees me and when I leave he always says something like ‚Äùsee you tommorrow‚Äù eventhough I was not planning on going tommorrow or said anything about it. And I honestly think that that is just his personality and I dont think anything will ever happen between us and I wouldnt even want that cause he is taken and with a child.

The shots I am getting are terribly sour ( at least I think that's how it's tasting). I didn't notice it with the milk based drinks so I assume the milk was just masking the sourness.

I have a Sage Duo Temp Pro Espresso Coffee Machine and the sage grinder to go with it ( I think these are called breville in other parts of the world) and I have all dose, timing and output all syncing up right from the info I have gathered online ( 18 in, 36 out in about 30 seconds) but it still tastes bad.

I have tried changing  the grind settings a few clicks up and down to make it finer and more coarse and running the shot for a longer time but it doesn't change anything. I have also tried loads of different beans ( supermarket, online roasters and bought direct from coffee shops that roast their own beans). At the moment I have beans from an online shop that was from a batch from 30/01/25 according to the batch number.

Can someone point me in the right direction in what I should try and change? I see people on sites like YouTube trying to get the perfect shot and getting it or close to it on the first few goes and here I am 10 shots down and still in the same position.

What would you be changing first if you was me? Should I go with a smaller dose? 14-16? I feel like I'm wasting so many beans trying to dial it in and am getting nowhere then they are all gone and I'm on to a new batch

How do we deal with it?,"Our 28 month old son is undergoing occupational therapy. He does not eat by himself. He must be fed pureed food. He does not tolerate chuncky food at all. We know this is not expected at his age and therefore he is seeing OT every week.

However, in last 2 months (December, January), I am finding that he has become more fussy. He has no fever and he is quite well. He does not let any of us (me, wife, uncle, aunty) out of the sight. He calls out every single thing that you might not have noticed or accepted as common noise. Examples include airplane, a/c sound, vaccum cleaner, cars, truck, someone pulling trash cans, mobile notifications etc. He does not like anything on his hand, such as vegetables or color. We bought Slime (playdoh) for him but he refuses to touch that. 

He is super obsessed with cars and trucks. I am concerned. Every day after lunch or at dinner with us, he wants cars. He wants cars and monster trucks all the time. I bought him cars since he always loved them since he was 3-4 month old. Now, if does not get cars, he starts crying incessantly. I feel scared and he gets cars. In a way, he has learned to get what he wants by crying. 

On learning front, he is doing fine. He is ahead of others when it comes to talking and complex sentences. He is exceptional when it comes to memory and sequences. He tells us all the time what's next activity (e.g. drinking water, lunch, afternoon coffee, dinner). 

On one hand, it is adorable that he calls out every single thing. For example, he will say, ""I am going to take a bite. I bring food to my mouth. I open my mouth. I bite food"". On the other hand, he does this for every single thing. It's a live action commentary for all the time he is awake.

He has never slept for full 8 hours except 3-4 days since he was born. Lately, his sleep is super irratic and he wants to be held all the time in the night. He sleeps next to me in crib but as soon as we put him down he starts crying loudly. I noticed his crying pattern and style has changed as well. He never cried loudly or did not cry much except in last 2 months. Now, he cries if does not get anything. 

He is our first child and only one. I don't have any experience with kids. My wife has BPD and every 15 days or so suffers from mild to medium episodes. I work from home taking care of him in the afternoon while she looks at him in the evening. I sleep at 3 am sometimes holding him, sometimes consoling him. 

1. Is this normal (except eating) for 28 month old? 

2. How do you deal with such hypersensitive child? 

3. I don't want him to be obsessed with cars as he is right now. How do I encourage learning, reading, and self play?

Most important, I want him to develop a calm personality as often seen in Nordic children. We are in the US if that matters.

It took me a dozen cups of coffee to even make it to her office. So she gave me another pill. It would knock me out, a face to pillow and lights out. ""Just take one of these before you go to sleep, that should help you out,"" she spoke to me in that fake, plastered smile, as she wrote down something in her notes. We talked more after that, her still giving me pointless advice before sending me on my way.

I don't remember the ride home, I get spacy often so nothing unusual for me. I practically skulked into my apartment, knocking the door open with my shoulder and crashing onto my couch. Grunting in pain as a jagged sprint jammed into my back for a moment, thankfully it didn't draw any blood. But I didn't care much if it did, I was so tired I could have lost my arm and I wouldn't even notice.

I looked over the bottle of pills, contemplating if I should take them. But decided ""fuck it"", Taking a pill and swallowing. Immediately, I felt the drug take effect. My eyelids felt as heavy as tungsten as I couldn't help but lay on my back and let myself drift into slumber.

I woke up several days later.

I wasn't on my couch, I was in a bed, not my bed, and not my house. I was in a motel. The smell of a rancid damp carpet filled my noses as I got up and explored my surroundings. Time felt off, like I'd been on a plane that flew halfway across the globe.

I tried walking around, but my legs wouldn't move. It's as if they just wouldn't listen to my brain. I was still standing - just immobile. But they suddenly caught up and I began to move.

I went to the front desk, made some small talk with the mad man at the front desk to calm my nerves, he had a bit of an accent, you don't usually see someone with a British accent around here.

""So, what brings you to the states?"" I asked. But was met with a confused look, he shot me back an awkward smile as if I just told a bad joke.

""What do you mean?""

""Well, I don't see many British people around here so I was just wondering.""

""Sir, you do realise you're in England right?""

I wasn't talking to him anymore, I was on a plane.

I frantically look around, shooting off of my chair before grabbing a flight attendant. As I grasped her shoulders and opened my mouth to beg for answers, I wasn't there.

I looked around, the familiar sight of the peeling paint in my apartment walls, and a loose spring drilled into my back. I thought I was dreaming, but it still felt real, I just sat up in my crusty chair before checking my phone.

5 Days had passed.

I blinked, it was night time and I was in my bed again. I didn't know what to do, I panicked and closed my eyes, trying to hide from whatever horrid reality I found myself in. I opened my eyes, 10 more days had passed.

I ran to my door while calling my therapist, she didn't answer. I opened my door, 3 weeks had passed.

I'm still in my house, I keep waking up on my crotch, I'm trapped.

I've been writing this over the last couple of months. Every paragraph I finish I look up and weeks¬† and weeks drift by. I can feel myself aging, my hair grow longer, my fingernails have begun curling with their length. My teeth are rotting in my mouth, I feel like I haven't brushed them in my mouth. The paint keeps peeling and peeling and my apartment is getting cold.

I started writing this 5 years ago. animals have nested in my home. My body is aging far faster than my mind. My eyes are blurry and my hearing is muffled. My fingers are weak and my nails droop down to my feet. All my teeth have fallen out.

And I'm so, so cold.",2,1738973081.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Somewhere seated alone in a coffee shop,
Headphones on,
Sipping her weekly usual.

Shuffled is her playlist,
Scrolling through emails,
Camera roll‚Äî
You know,
That day-to-day shit.

Learning to love alone time,
Growing more patient.
Lost in a daze, no trace of yesterday,
Or the waves of thoughts
Her yearnings might obey.

Watching the passing couplets,
Wondering what phase they‚Äôre in‚Äî
Is it the honeymoon,
Or the slow roast of many years
Settling in?

She wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs lonely,
Maybe a tad bit distant.
The nature of reality
Makes life seem
Like one never-ending mission.

No time for stillness, no space to breathe,
Constantly pushing the boundaries of need.
Out of touch with her true element,
She‚Äôs finding it harder to cope.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a girl,‚Äù she says,
When faced with big decisions.
Waiting to be noticed,
A romantic truly hopeless‚Äî
Awaiting to be approached,
Courted,
Escorted.

Weaving through the crowds,
the broadness of his shoulders,
Yet the willingness to lower his crown.
In her mind, she‚Äôs in the clouds,
But this picture,
The only tether to the ground.

A vision she keeps secret,
Veiled behind a smile.
Looking up, realization strikes‚Äî

1ik9pey,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1ik9pey/45_m4f_kansas_city_looking_for_a_partner_in_the/,45 [M4F] #Kansas City - Looking for a partner in the Midwest.,"Hello!

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Anyway, thanks for reading all that. Hope to hear from you!",1,1738972848.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

The Furinno Simple Design Coffee Table, model 11179EX, has been part of my living room setup for a while now, and I have to say, it‚Äôs been an interesting addition. While it‚Äôs not going to win any awards for premium craftsmanship, it does a decent job for its price point.

I remember unpacking the box with a mix of excitement and skepticism. The espresso-colored engineered wood finish looked surprisingly sleek, and the rounded corner design added a nice touch of safety, especially with my little nephew running around. At 35.5 inches wide, 21.61 inches deep, and 15.7 inches high, the table has a compact footprint that‚Äôs perfect for smaller spaces. My tiny apartment living room didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed by it, which was a relief since I was worried it might make the space look cluttered.

[Check Furinno Simple Design Coffee Table 11179EX price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/furinno-11179ex-coffee-table-review-b003voze6m/)

The assembly process was straightforward but not without its quirks. The instructions were clear enough, though I had to dig out my own hammer and screwdriver since no tools were included. It took me about 30 minutes to put it together, which isn‚Äôt bad at all. Just make sure you don‚Äôt lose any screws or bolts because there aren‚Äôt any extras provided. That‚Äôs a bit of a gamble, especially if you‚Äôre as clumsy as I am.

Once assembled, the table felt reasonably sturdy on flat surfaces. It‚Äôs not the kind of table you want to load with heavy objects, though. Its maximum weight recommendation is 20 pounds, so I wouldn‚Äôt dare place anything heavier than a stack of books, a couple of coffee mugs, and maybe a decorative vase on it. One of the highlights for me was the lower shelf, which turned out to be a lifesaver for organizing magazines and remote controls. My roommate even used it as a makeshift gaming station, and it held up fine.

Maintenance, however, is where things start to get a little tricky. The surface doesn‚Äôt do well with stains, and scratches show up more easily than I‚Äôd like. I learned this the hard way after a coffee mishap left a faint but irritating mark that refused to come off, even with a good scrub. If you‚Äôre someone who frequently sets down drinks or snacks, coasters are non-negotiable.

**Pros**

* Stylish, minimalist design that blends well with various decor styles.
* Compact and space-saving, ideal for apartments or small living rooms.
* Budget-friendly, offering decent value for its price.
* Lower shelf provides additional storage and keeps the tabletop clutter-free.

**Cons**

* Limited weight capacity; not suitable for heavy objects.
* Surface prone to stains and scratches, requiring careful maintenance.
* No assembly tools included, and no spare hardware provided.
* Can feel slightly wobbly over time, especially on uneven flooring.

When I compared the Furinno coffee table to a few competitors like the IKEA LACK coffee table, the differences became clear. While IKEA‚Äôs option boasts a more solid build and better stain resistance, it lacks the additional shelf that the Furinno offers. On the other hand, the Mainstays Parsons coffee table matches Furinno in price but falls short in aesthetics, looking a bit more basic and less refined. The Furinno strikes a balance between functionality and design, making it a better choice for spaces where style matters.

In terms of value for money, the Furinno 11179EX coffee table delivers what you‚Äôd expect for its price. It‚Äôs a budget-friendly option for those who need a simple table without breaking the bank. However, the compromises in durability and maintenance mean it‚Äôs not a long-term investment if you‚Äôre looking for something heavy-duty.

Features-wise, the coffee table does its job with no frills. It‚Äôs a no-nonsense piece of furniture. Its engineered wood construction is lightweight and easy to move, but it‚Äôs also a double-edged sword since it doesn‚Äôt feel as substantial as solid wood. The laminated finish looks attractive but is far from scratch-proof.

Would I recommend it? If you‚Äôre looking for a temporary or budget-friendly solution, it‚Äôs worth considering. Just keep in mind its limitations, and don‚Äôt expect it to handle rough use or heavy loads.

anyway every time i go there and pick up my drink, i always say thank you, regardless of if whoever is behind the bar say it back to me or not. i like to think manners are super important. but i‚Äôve started to notice something, over the months.

i go there and pick up my drink, and every time he‚Äôs there behind the bar he says thank you first. all the time. right when my hands touch my coffee cup. i‚Äôm always too shy to look at him or anywhere else besides my coffee. he didn‚Äôt do this before. i‚Äôd say thank you and make zero eye contact and walk right out, but i went in there one day and walked out as usual and then i hear a loud and clear ‚Äúthank you!‚Äù and i turn my head cause i‚Äôm all stunned and it was him. i looked at him and he turned his head right away and smiled. i gave him a smile like this üôÇ and said thank you (again) and walked out.

we have this back and fourth thing going on. i walk in to get my order after the app lets me know it‚Äôs ready, and if he‚Äôs there, i kind of get the sense that he‚Äôs watching me right when i walk in. before i even get the chance to say anything he‚Äôs already saying it to me sometimes softly, in a gentle voice and i look at him and say thank you but he‚Äôs already looked away and he‚Äôs smiling. 

but yesterday was much different. i walk in as usual, and this time he‚Äôs much closer to the counter. like right behind there, where only that counter is the only thing separating us. he says thank you again and this time i notice he has an accent‚Äî which is so cute omg‚Äî and me being me, i‚Äôm feeling very, very nervous because he‚Äôs so close! so i don‚Äôt make eye contact at all but still say thank you anyway and walk out. 

TLDR: Noticed a barista acting slightly different with me over time‚Äîtiming his ‚Äòthank you‚Äô right as I grab my drink, moving closer, subtly smiling when I look at him. Is this customer service or something more? ",2,1738972568.0,Crushes,0,0.75,False

Father & mother 71y married for 50years unhappily. Father has ADHD, mother is autistic-narcissistic some borderline personality disorders. They have both been gambling (it‚Äôs legal in the country they reside) at a casino about $150,000 per year for about 7years and father has been gambling for about 25 years. He is also an alcoholic for about 10years. Now he has a job to pay for his gambling so he straddles red bull, coffee and wine (after work) sometimes red bull before bed.  They have earnt about $30,000-$50,000 per year on average so they sold down their rental home which they had said they would leave to me to have gambling income (it was the home I was born in and they bought it from my grandparents). I was able to receive funds from it as they have given my brother a hefty amount of money over they years and when I found out I have been neglected I spoke up, they gave me about 70% the amount they had given him. He is 40y divorced as he was cheating on his pregnant wife. He has 6y & 3y children used as tokens with our parents. He is highly autistic-psychopathic-manipulative. He can block out anything that does not serve him and has zero concern for anyone else aside from himself. 

There‚Äôs a lot of manipulation that goes on with them and I don‚Äôt know how to participate with their existence that doesn‚Äôt condone what they do. 

They have zero relationship with me or care to, they keep me around as I‚Äôm helpful and good looking. They do not like my power. They want me to be there but not say anything. I‚Äôm not one to let anybody be treated badly. Especially not myself. (Through learning the opportunistic nature of individuals)

They have let their home become badly infested with mold so I‚Äôve been there cleaning up for two months and they have been ignoring me the whole time.

Our trash service has an upcoming reuse day and landfill pickup day. But the rules are so stringent and confusing.

The reuse day says gently used furniture not worn. The landfill day says no furnture or mattresses. Does the rug count as ""furniture""? Do we need to call a paid junk removal service just for the coffee table and dresser?

You are holding a cup of coffee when someone comes along and bumps into you or shakes your arm, making you spill your coffee everywhere.
Why did you spill the coffee?
""Because someone bumped into me!!!""

Wrong answer.

You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup.
Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea.  Whatever is inside the cup is what will spill out.

Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which WILL happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It's easy to fake it, until you get rattled.

So we have to ask ourselves... ‚Äúwhat's in my cup?""
When life gets tough, what spills over?
Joy, gratitude, peace and humility?
Or
Anger, bitterness, victim mentality and quitting tendencies?

Life provids the cup, YOU choose how to fill it.

I‚Äôm 44F no kids, single, traditional Italian family. I‚Äôm not sure how to have a relationship with my family. 

Father & mother 71y married for 50years unhappily. Father has ADHD, mother is autistic-narcissistic some borderline personality disorders. They have both been gambling (it‚Äôs legal in the country they reside) at a casino about $150,000 per year for about 7years and father has been gambling for about 25 years. He is also an alcoholic for about 10years. Now he has a job to pay for his gambling so he straddles red bull, coffee and wine (after work) sometimes red bull before bed.  They have earnt about $30,000-$50,000 per year on average so they sold down their rental home which they had said they would leave to me to have gambling income (it was the home I was born in and they bought it from my grandparents). I was able to receive funds from it as they have given my brother a hefty amount of money over they years and when I found out I have been neglected I spoke up, they gave me about 70% the amount they had given him. He is 40y divorced as he was cheating on his pregnant wife. He has 6y & 3y children used as tokens with our parents. He is highly autistic-psychopathic-manipulative. He can block out anything that does not serve him and has zero concern for anyone else aside from himself. 

There‚Äôs a lot of manipulation that goes on with them and I don‚Äôt know how to participate with their existence that doesn‚Äôt condone what they do. 

They have zero relationship with me or care to, they keep me around as I‚Äôm helpful and good looking. They do not like my power. They want me to be there but not say anything.

They have let their home become badly infested with mold so I‚Äôve been there cleaning up for two months and they have been ignoring me the whole time.

This small yet efficient electric coffee grinder is perfect for anyone who enjoys freshly ground coffee or dabbles in grinding spices. I‚Äôve been using it daily for months now, and it‚Äôs earned its spot among my most-used kitchen gadgets.

Compact and lightweight, this grinder fits snugly on my countertop without hogging space. The black finish with stainless steel accents gives it a sleek and modern look, which blends well with my other appliances. Its plastic and stainless steel construction feels sturdy enough for regular use, though I wouldn‚Äôt call it indestructible. The removable grinding chamber is a thoughtful touch, making it super easy to fill, pour, and clean. I toss it in the dishwasher occasionally, and it comes out spotless every time.

[Click here to see the price](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/hamilton-beach-80335r-review-with-asin-b005eprfko).

Grinding performance is where this little device really shines. The stainless steel blades take beans and spices down to a fine or coarse grind with ease, depending on how long you hold the button. As someone who prefers their coffee brewed in different styles, the flexibility is a plus. However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that the grinding process isn‚Äôt as precise as a burr grinder, so if you‚Äôre a hardcore coffee aficionado, you may notice a slight inconsistency in grind size. For my needs‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs French press or drip coffee‚Äîit performs admirably.

Using this grinder couldn‚Äôt be simpler. You just add the beans or spices, pop on the lid, and press the button. Release the button, and it stops instantly. There‚Äôs no need to fiddle with complicated settings, which is a blessing when I‚Äôm still half-asleep in the morning. That said, I sometimes wish it had pre-programmed grind settings for added convenience. It‚Äôs also quieter than most grinders I‚Äôve tried, which is a lifesaver at 6 AM when my family‚Äôs still asleep.

Its capacity is impressive for such a compact unit. The grinding chamber holds enough beans for up to 12 cups of coffee, which is plenty for my household. Speed-wise, it takes mere seconds to achieve the desired grind consistency. I‚Äôve used it to grind not just coffee beans but also spices like cumin and coriander. It handles these with no problem, though very fine grinding of harder spices might require a bit more time.

Let‚Äôs talk about the grinding mechanism for a moment. Since it uses blades rather than burrs, you‚Äôre sacrificing some precision for affordability and ease of use. For casual coffee drinkers or home cooks, this trade-off is hardly noticeable. However, if you‚Äôre making espresso or need an ultra-consistent grind, this might not be the best option.

**Pros**

* Compact size and sleek design.
* Quiet operation compared to competitors.
* Removable grinding chamber for easy cleaning.
* Versatile enough for coffee beans and spices.
* Simple, intuitive controls.

**Cons**

* Lack of grind size presets might frustrate some users.
* Blade mechanism leads to slight inconsistencies in grind size.
* Cord could be longer for more flexibility in placement.

Comparing this grinder to some of its competitors like the Krups F203 or the Cuisinart DBM-8, the Hamilton Beach 80335R stands out for its simplicity and quiet operation. It doesn‚Äôt have the same high-end features as the Cuisinart, which offers burr grinding and more precise settings, but it‚Äôs also significantly cheaper. While the Krups is comparable in price and performance, the Hamilton Beach's removable chamber makes it easier to clean, which is a big win in my book.

Regarding cost, this grinder is budget-friendly without feeling cheap. It‚Äôs a great value for anyone who wants a reliable, straightforward grinder for daily use. While you can spend more on a burr grinder with extra features, the Hamilton Beach 80335R delivers solid results for its price point. It‚Äôs certainly worth the investment if you‚Äôre looking for something practical and efficient.

This grinder also features hidden cord storage, which is a small but thoughtful addition. It keeps my counter clutter-free and makes storing the unit much easier. The stainless steel blades are durable, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any dulling despite frequent use. The grinding bowl is dishwasher-safe, but handwashing it is just as easy if you‚Äôre in a rush.

All in all, this product does what it promises‚Äîgrind coffee beans and spices quickly, quietly, and without hassle. It‚Äôs not without its flaws, but they‚Äôre minor enough that I don‚Äôt feel they detract significantly from the overall experience.

Hi ladies. I don't feel comfortable confiding in anyone I know about this but I really needed to spill it somewhere. 

I've been with my husband for eight years. In the first year we were together he went on three solo trips to Morocco, I found it suspicious at the time but I put it down to my own insecurities from previous relationships. 

Three years after that trip I found out he was messaging a woman from over there on and off, it broke my heart because she sent me some of the messages and he had told her he loved her. I asked her if they had met before, she told me they hadn't. She said they had spoke about it but she hadn't been able to. I was so hurt but I gave him another chance, he claimed the only reason he had been still in communication with her on and off was because she owed him money and he wanted it back. 

Fast forward to 2023 I discovered emails which completely knocked me for six, in 2018 and 2021 he had emailed an adult worker asking if they were available. When I confronted him he  claimed that he didn't know why he did it but that he never went through with it, more of a on a whim then when reality hit he stopped himself going further. I was heavily pregnant at the time and just wanted it all to go away so yet again I moved past it, I had no evidence that he had. 

Since then I've been tormented with the past, my trust is skakey at best. Last week I discovered that he wasn't happy with the frequency we have sex after discovering he had told his friend how often we have it. 
That really hurt me, I'm quite a private person, I work hard and I do everything I can for my family with very little time or thought for myself. It shook everything up to the surface for me, Ive been quiet this past week thinking about it all but last night I asked him for the ""truth"". 

We sat down and he said he would be honest, that I deserves the truth and he would answer all my questions honestly. 

My first question was why was he in morroco?. 

He told me he had been trying to meet the woman I caught him talking to, everytime he went out there she was a no show. I asked him if he met anyone else out there, he told me he met a woman at the beach and took her out for food and a coffee. 

That has actually hurt me to my core, we didn't live together at the time but we had been together 10 months. He was very much a part of my family, spent time with my children and extended family and told me he loved me. 

I asked him about the adult workers, he still maintains he didn't see them but when pressed admitted to using them before we met. 

I don't want to shame anyone for using adult workers or being an adult worker but the truth is had I known that it would have changed my views of him from day one. 

I feel like last night was the first time of me truly meeting my husband. 
I didn't yell, I didn't get upset. I told him I'm glad he was honest after years of me asking him to tell me the truth. 

I told him I needed time for this all to sink in. 

Today I feel awful. 

Was I just never enough from day one?. 

He told me he's always loved me and it's not that at all but how would you feel if you were me?. I suppose that's why I'm here, how would you feel? because right now I just feel sad and not enough. ",1,1738971349.0,WifeRant,0,1.0,False

- I started quercetin 500 mg (Webber naturals) to replace cetirizine for several issues (PEM/PESE, eye pain).

- I noticed a lot of tingling on the first day, and continued with 500 mg daily for three days. Second dose onward, tingling went down. Tingling was the not painful type, so I wasn‚Äôt too concerned with it. 

- I did have a major sensitivity to coffee a long time ago and I‚Äôve heard individuals with that sensitivity should also avoid quercetin (no reference).

- My dose and timing for cetirizine was 20 mg in the morning (initially going a long time with 10 mg in the morning for PEM/PESE and 10 mg at night to prevent waking up with racing heart feeling).

- A more comprehensive list of many of the symptoms I had/have from a comment I made some time back https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/s/qfXNOTKKxX

Today I took my third dose and fell asleep shortly after for several hours. That rest was very refreshing to say the least‚Ä¶ Sadly it‚Äôs late in the day now.

I‚Äôve posted here before and I‚Äôm back. I‚Äôm tired of being miserable. It‚Äôs been 1 month and 7 days of walking, yoga, and (almost always) following AIP diet. I haven‚Äôt had gluten this year. It‚Äôs been a noticeable improvement (less migraines, less illness, better sleep, less bloating, less absences from work) but I know I have a long way to go. I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate to feeling so terrible that even a mildly good day feels like magic. I want to feel so good that I question my reality so I‚Äôm on this mission.

I lived in her country for a while but we were fairly far away, so we only met for coffees a few times when she was in my city, and exclusively as friends. She has always encouraged me to practice her language even when I had no confidence in my skills, and that eventually led to a lot more texting where we got to know each other properly. We've talked about almost everything including love and relationships, we are similar people emotionally and career-wise, and at the moment it seems we want very similar things (a proper long-term relationship, to begin with.)

I've always noticed she's gorgeous on the outside, but through our texts I've also gotten to know that she is a really kind and compassionate person with an amazing mind, and that's what makes a person attractive to me. We send voice messages occasionally and have plans to call, but I would definitely need to see her in person where she is‚Äîlikely a few months from now, since it requires a flight‚Äîbefore asking her about it.

Obviously there's no guarantee that things will work out and if they don't, I would be happy staying friends (based on what I know of her, I think she would be too.) But is there anything I could do to suggest/hint at my interest before we call or meet again, since I'm not sure she's considered me as anything other than a friend yet?

For context, our texts have already been a bit playful on occasion (which is just her natural personality) and we do give friendly compliments to each other from time to time. She also absolutely knows how good she looks and I think she is generally open to more compliments from that side, but I don't have much experience with flirting and tend to be cautious about it.",1,1738970527.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Roads were very good (little bumpy to Islita, but no issues).  
T-Mobile phone worked just about everywhere for data/texting.
Car rental(used points) through Alamo was a breeze. Fast pick up and drop off. No hard sell on insurance.
Got a few bug bites, but really not very buggy.
Went through sunscreen like water.
Remained vigilant about not leaving valuables unwatched in car/on beach, but never felt unsafe.  
Never used atm or exchange. Only one place wanted cash, and took dollars.

Stuff we loved:
-Playa Carrillo for morning/sunset swims.
-sunset boat cruise with Samara Adventures(includes snorkeling/swimming/lots of drinks and decent food.
-playa islita is a very nice little beach(had a great lunch at a soda in town, would probably skip macaw rescue, but was happy to see the birds and support the cause)
-deep sea fishing was a ton of fun, but expensive.  Saw hundreds of spinner dolphins.

FOOD
-the meat market off the plaza in Samara is good!  Marinated steaks were very tasty grilled at home)
-rindemas was the best grocery in town(glad we stopped at Walmart for staples).  China was less than great and pricey. Cook at home!
-restaurants were mostly ok to good.
Colibri in Carrillo is very good(steaks and empanadas). El Lagarto was good(stuffed chicken breast  was fav, would skip pizza next time). El pelicano was good(fresh ingredients. Tuna poke. The falafel place was very good(cash only).  I wouldn‚Äôt go back to Cocos.
Roots bakery had great iced coffee and pasties. 
Plaza Soda had good breakfast in Carrillo. 

Stuff I‚Äôd like to do next time:
Playa barrigona and spend the day at the beach club on playa Islita.

long story short, mainly because of this rage, i went to the doctor a little over a week ago and got on antidepressants. the first few days of taking them i realized drinking coffee along with the side effects was giving me heart palpitations and i took a 3 day break, and in those 3 days i actually felt relatively calm which i chalked up to my antidepressants maybe starting to work. WELL, today i made myself an iced coffee to see if the heart palpitations would still bother me and i am once again agitated and just in a terrible mood again. this little break from coffee i took is making me wonder if this is the cause of most of my anger issues lately and i‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else can relate",17,1738969833.0,decaf,19,1.0,False

One example is my partner just rested my box of malteasers on top of a lidded bin where I put snacks waste and other bits of packaging, fluff and sometimes food waste. I ended up yelling at them because thats my food on top of a bin when there's a perfectly good spot on the coffee table and I am so particular about my food. 

I would go so far as to say that I'm am the most picky about food. How it's stored, what goes next to it, if it gets on the floor. We got a takeout tonight and my partner got some onion on the sofa and it made me cringe so badly and I felt like yelling (but didn't)

I feel bad for yelling at them, as it really is a small thing thinking about it, but I was wondering how other neuro divergent people react when someone messes with something that they don't realise is important. How do you keep a lid on your anger and frustration if you do at all?

1ik8kbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/byzantium/comments/1ik8kbe/opening_a_can_of_worms_i_prefer_using_the_term/,Opening a can of worms: I prefer using the term 'Byzantine',"I am actually in favour of sticking to the term 'Byzantine' Empire. A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to have a certain, established and authoritative English Byzantinist (who will remain nameless) as a dissertation supervisor. While under the influence of many a strong coffee, we passionately discussed many aspects of Byzantine culture. 

At the time I was zealously convinced that the Byzantium should be referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire because it was the legitimate continuation of the Roman state, rather than some barbarian rump state. I was equally convinced that we as students/scholars/ hobbyists should refer to the people living within those borders as Rhomaoi. This viewpoint, I believe, is shared by many on this Reddit. 

  
Yet the old Don was quick to point out the usual argument of practicality and distinction when applying the terms 'Byzantium' or 'Byzantine'. However, he definitively shattered my belief (hopes) that these people were 'Rhomaoi'. He pointed out that many different people were living in a diverse empire at different times. Identity also changes through time. 

He argued that the elites in Constantinople were masquerading through elaborate court ceremonies and rituals under the pretext of maintaining Romanitas to maintain legitimacy and impress foreign visitors. At first, I found this argument slightly rich, coming from a Western, English scholar well-educated in Latin rather than Greek. Yet upon closer study of the sources, this is the interpretation of Byzantine elite culture and identity that I find most convincing. I would encourage people to re-read Porphyrogenitus with this argument in mind. 

But how did they identify? If you were to ask a random Byzantine living in the 12th century, ""How do you identify?"" He probably wouldn't get your question; he will tell you what family he is from and then which village. At most, he might tell you a surname if he was wealthy enough to have one. But perhaps he would claim that he is a Christian. He also might identify with a certain place, e.g., Phillipoppolis, Moglena, Antioch, and then a certain region, e.g., Macedonia, Armenia, or Paphlogonia. Well, if you ask the elites like Anna Comnena then she might claim she's a Rhomaia. There are also distinct ethnic groups living within the state at different times - Pechenegs, Vlachs, Slavs, Greeks and more. All of these factors complicate the usage of 'Rhomaoi'. Similarly, 'Romans' would be completely inappropriate as everyone would think you are referring to the empire of antiquity. 

I find Asen's Column inscription of Klokotnitsa of the 1230s of increased interest when it comes to this matter. John Asen II defeated Theodore Komnin Doukas at a time when the 'Byzantine Empire' did not formally exist. There existed different dynasties claiming overlordship of it as a similar Reddit post showed recently.  Despite the political entity not formally existing, an extract of the inscription dictates: ""I went to war in *Rhomania* and annihilated the *Greek* army and himself Theodor Komnin and all his boyars I took"". Was Rhomania then a geographical rather than a cultural designation? Was he purposefully also insulting these 'Rhomaoi' by calling them Greeks? Was Doukas' realm Rhomania? 

 This pokes at a broader historiographical misconception, especially favoured by history hobbyists. We should view medieval political entities not as formalised states but as evolving dynastic realms. 

I've merely opened the can of worms; I do not propose solutions or alternatives. I stand here waiting to see what the professionals, the educated, the uneducated and, of course, the opinionated will have to say to this.",20,1738969730.0,byzantium,12,0.67,False

She was fifteen minutes late and obviously hungover. I had been waiting in my car for the last twenty five. 

She ordered a venti caramel macchiato with four espresso shots. I had a small oat milk cappuccino- more than a shot of espresso after noon will keep me up all night. She raised her eyebrows and looked over at me when they asked us to pay. I obliged. 

She asked when we get married. I told her ‚Äú2020, but we‚Äôre not married anymore.‚Äù She said, ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ then what‚Äôs with the ring?‚Äù I told her that she wouldn‚Äôt believe me if I told her. 

She started talking about something that happened at the bar the night before. I laughed and told her that we haven‚Äôt been there in years. She asked why. She looked so sad when I told her what happened. 

I told her that we‚Äôre two years sober again. She said ‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúYes- again. We‚Äôve been trying to do this consistently since 2018 but it wasn‚Äôt always easy.‚Äù

She paused, swirled her drink around, and said ‚ÄúI bet.‚Äù 

I wish she could see how much of the world she doesn‚Äôt know yet. How many people will change her. How many mistakes she‚Äôs going to make over the next few years. How much time will change her life. 

But right now she‚Äôs focused on the bar. And the next special event at work. And the sadness and anger she won‚Äôt let go of. 

As much as what changed in the last decade, those feelings are still there- the sadness and anger. But we changed the point of view and approach to life that we have. The support and care for ourselves and others, trying to find serenity, and hope for whatever the future might hold. This is what we live for now. 

I‚Äôll say a teary eyed goodbye and tell her to remember to show people that she loves them when she does. And to ask for help when she‚Äôs ready for it. And to remember that she‚Äôs beautiful and strong. 

She rolls her eyes and says ‚Äúyou sound like mom‚Äù I smile and hug her tighter and say ‚Äúbabe, that‚Äôs kind of the point.‚Äù",12,1738969624.0,stopdrinking,1,0.94,False
1ik8hol,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1ik8hol/no_lawsuit_over_cobb_salad_actual_context/,No lawsuit over Cobb Salad (actual context),"Hey so y'all have probably seen the other post from u/Billyfeelbad about being sued over a Cobb salad. Here's the other side to it, I know it's long, but nothing was cherry picked or diminished.

My wife and I helped plan the entire engagement, to include setting up a trip to California, making reservations and pretty much all the decisions because the simplest decisions require a collective of brain cells to overcome a wall of indecision,¬† when it comes to Billy and significant other (who we will call Ashley). I have known Ashley since 2011, and have known Billy since April of 2023, as that is roughly the time I met him shortly after he and Ashley started dating.  
  
We took time off work to set this up and even saved the engagement when Billy had a little too much to drink after being warned by staff that the ‚ÄúCry Tai Mai Tai‚Äù would probably not be a good idea, causing a very tearful proposal to ensue.  
  
We were happy to be a part of the process because Billy and significant other are like family to us (considering I have known Ashley for as long as I have and we have Sunday dinners at Ashley's Aunt's house - the realtor that sold me my house and initially sold me on moving to this state. She is also like family to me because I too have known her for almost 15 years).

Fast forward to the wedding planning process where Ashley, started to attempt to plan the wedding. Ashley had designated her out of state best friend as the Maid of Honor, a task that usually comes with great status and responsibility. Ashley‚Äôs Maid of Honor was not able to do literally anything, was not present for any planning regarding touring venues, dress shopping, or any day to day operations regarding the wedding. My wife, used her network to secure a venue, go dress shopping (driving through multiple counties and stores) to get things done, and spent almost every day together - given the short turnaround process between the proposal and wedding. Ashley then asked my wife to be the Matron of Honor.  
  
Fast forward to the Ireland trip. We asked them to watch our two cats, which we were thankful for. We paid them $200 to watch the cats (which is wild that little detail wasn‚Äôt mentioned). We also bought Creed concert tickets as a thank you and we all went to the Creed concert together when we came back from Ireland (Billy did offer to pay for the Creed tickets several times but I insisted it was okay, he paid for food and beverages)  
  
We use Pine Pellets for litter instead of traditional cat litter, so changing it is a little different. I made a demonstrative video on how to change the litter, which was very specific (throw it all away, don‚Äôt just put new pellets on top). The litter needs to be changed every few days, because there are two of them, and they are shit monsters. Now, when you use Pine Pellets for litter, after being pissed and shit in for a while it starts to look like sawdust, which at that point, you know it needed to be changed like yesterday. The odor of piss and shit will also become very noticeable if it is not changed in time. So typically, I‚Äôd wait until it‚Äôs like this weird half sawdust/half pine pellet mixture before tossing it out. I also mark the bag of pine pellets after use to gauge how many litter replacements I‚Äôll have left before needing to buy more.  
  
So we return from Ireland, get home, and are overcome with the smell of piss and shit from the cat litter box. Now, cats are generally clean creatures, so if their litter box is a filthy cesspool of piss and shit, they‚Äôll find something similar to the litter box and piss and shit in that instead. About half an hour after we got home, our male cat started scratching the floor by his litter box as if to clean his paws, then he went over to a nearby cardboard box and started to piss. We checked the litter box, and it looked like saw dust. I checked the bag of pine pellets, and about half an inch of it was used from the marking (likely to top off the litter box).  
  
So anyway, fast forward a week or two, the girls have a bridesmaids get together where Ashley begins to brag to the other bridesmaids about yelling at the cats with how annoying they were, in their own home, using their litter box at night because Billy and Ashley couldn‚Äôt sleep. We live relatively close to the downtown area, so Ashley and Billy crashed at our place to avoid drunk driving and just get kicked out of Ubers instead while they go out and have a few nights out together. Totally fine. Until you yell at my animals while you‚Äôre drunk, which I can only imagine how that could be considering the track record of being kicked out of Ubers for being obnoxious drunks and not having anyone else in the home to be the sober voice of reason.  
  
Anyway, we tell Ashley and Billy that we didn‚Äôt like that behavior and Ashley goes and gets our aunt (oh yeah that‚Äôs how we‚Äôve known each other for years btw), to draft a shitty half assed template apology. Which Aunt and Ashley both admitted to taking place. So essentially, we told Billy and Ashley ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt talking to you at the moment‚Äù, in attempt to process our feelings as to not say something stupid/impulsive or go on Reddit to ask strangers for advice and actually process what we need in order to move forward productively.  
  
About a month goes by, we call Ashley and Billy to talk and Ashley gets upset because she waited a month to hear back from us. I brought up how the apology seemed very disingenuous and insincere. She then kept making the whole conversation about her and how she felt, rather than addressing the actual point of the call: which was pretty much ‚Äúhey we feel that you wronged us, this is how we‚Äôd like to move forward because we love you‚Äù - she kept trying to deflect and cry about how she didn‚Äôt like OUR response to a problem SHE created. At one point she said ‚Äúit just feels like my apology wasn‚Äôt good enough‚Äù to which I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right, it wasn‚Äôt‚Äù and she CONTINUED to downplay our feelings, refusing to acknowledge that we did in fact feel that our trust was betrayed. She kept on insisting this was a ‚Äúfiasco‚Äù or a ‚Äúkerfuffle‚Äù but would not acknowledge that we felt our trust was broken. But we still were able to move past it and all say we‚Äôre sorry and that we love each other.  
  
Fast forward to Christmas, all seems relatively okay. We exchange Christmas gifts with everyone, we gave every everyone the same gift (because we‚Äôre all family - Us, Aunt and Uncle, Grammy, my friend from the military, and Billy and Ashley). Everyone got candied pecans from our pecan tree, a coffee mug with awkward couple poses of us on it, and homemade spiced Honey in a mason jar. We then played white elephant, and we purchased a jewelry cleaner with the intent that Ashley and Billy win that gift (while on the phone with them about the apology, we told them that we bought a white elephant gift directed to them). I also peppered in joke gifts to everyone included in white elephant, where I hid beers, oranges, and potatoes - as when I was wrapping the gifts I thought it would be funny to put random shit in the gift bags.  
  
Anyway, about a week or so goes by and they tell us we‚Äôre out of the wedding. The 10 day demand letter isn‚Äôt us suing you bro, it‚Äôs an attempt to try and handle things amicably before anything turns civil. It is an attempt to ask you in writing with confirmation of receipt, so that you can't pull the ""we never got the text"" or ""you never asked us for payment"" card (added this sentence from original post on Billy's post).

 A written notice was sent to you since dodging accountability seemed to be the trend of this whole ‚Äúkerfuffle‚Äù and the difficulty of personal accountability. So yeah, we have receipts, clearly - is it petty, yeah maybe, but the phone has always worked two ways and you could have called me before claiming you‚Äôre being sued and again downplaying the entire thing by making a story about ‚ÄúA Cobb salad and IRS mileage.‚Äù  
  
Fuck the salad and the miles, it‚Äôs the principle dawg. A demand letter shouldn‚Äôt have had to be sent for y‚Äôall to be able to take accountability, and reimburse us for the dress (that Ashley specifically asked my wife to purchase), and all wedding work that was asked of my wife when appointed Matron of Honor, only to be kicked out of the wedding after all the hard shit was done.  
  
The ideal scenario from all of this could have been as simple as ‚ÄúYeah, we made a mistake. Sorry for yelling at your cats, let‚Äôs have beers about it.‚Äù I vouched for you. But the repeated dismissive behavior, downplaying and lack of accountability and sense of entitlement of ‚ÄúAshley‚Äù throughout this whole ‚Äúfiasco‚Äù really just sucked man. You‚Äôre still a pinned contact in my text thread, and I genuinely considered you my family so this just sucks.  
  
Also the demand letter isn‚Äôt directed at you, it‚Äôs directed to Ashley, so maybe do her a solid and allow her to be held accountable before her inability to take accountability becomes an inevitable issue in your marriage in 10 years.

  
It should be noted that Billy and Ashley have watched our cats before on a short 3 day trip (which we again paid them to do). We came back and had to throw away the papasan cushion due to the cats pissing and shitting on it due to the litter box being absolutely shrek'd. We let it slide that time.

  
Hope this adds some context, also Billy, if you have a picture of the potato, please post it so reddit can enjoy the art too.

I posted this in a different sub originally but it kept getting removed. 

So I recently met this man through mutual friends at a group activity that I frequent regularly. He is much older than me, and I am used to dating older men. My last boyfriend was 55. But I am trying to be aware that this is not normal for everyone lol. 

He would chat with me often and even asked for my number so we could meet up for coffee some time. He does not seem to be a big texter which sort of bothered me at first but now isn't a big deal, and I kind of like it.

He seemed like he was being careful with me at first and I had to initiate a first meeting. I decided to be direct and told him I was interested in getting together with him for a date. He said, ""oh, wow. great"" We had a first date, even kissed after, and continued talking. Last week he went away for a trip with friends for a few days and communication really dropped off. Even the day before he went he was being flirty, talking about doing something together, then did not mention it anymore. I did not hear from him much while on his trip which was fine because I knew he was on vacation enjoying himself.

But since he got back, there hasn't been much communication. I have seen him a few times at this group activity and he will chat with me and even flirt a bit, but something feels... off. I don't know how to describe it. I am big on intuition and I'm sensing that he may have second thoughts or has lost interest. 

This may sound vain, but I know he is physically attracted to me. He has made comments about what great shape I am in and I regularly catch him looking at me.

To answer a common question, no, he is not married. He has been divorced for a long time, has ""single"" in his socials, and we know people in common who also say he is single.

I feel like I've really been putting myself out there. I initiated the first meeting and have made comments about other things since, but he has not asked me out again. The communication has also really dropped off this week. I don't feel comfortable being the one to initiate a second meeting. 

Is this normal? I feel like I‚Äôm second guessing everything I say and whether to reach out to him or not. 

I can't tell if he's just not that into me or if there is something else holding him back. Any input would be great!

We went through it with our first baby as well so I felt prepared, but this one is giving us a run for our money. Her stamina is insane!

My mom comes by twice a week to spend a couple hours with the kids while I catch up on housework, etc. Baby is fine with her, even though I'm not usually in the room with them.

Now, she screams inconsolably the entire time I leave the room, and nothing seems to work. My mom has tried distracting her with cuddles, playing in the mirror, singing, toys, peekaboo, all of the typical things that usually work after a little while.

The first time this happened was when my husband and I went out for coffee for an hour. Baby screamed for the entire hour, only stopping when we returned home.

My in-laws also come by twice a week and the same thing is happening with them. I wasn't able to step away at all.

The problem is that my husband and I have front row tickets to a Cirque show coming up in two weeks, which we've been looking forward to for several months. Now we are hesitant about going if it means my mom will have to deal with baby screaming the entire time we're gone, while also trying to navigate the bedtime routine with our toddler.

We would ask our in-laws for backup, but they are out of town that weekend. We don't have anyone else to ask.

Are there any tricks to help fast track this phase, or at least help it decrease in intensity? I'm looking for advice on things we can do over the next two weeks to hopefully help baby feel more comfortable.

About an hour after taking the bupropion and 1/2 green pill in the morning(on an empty stomach, I try to do OMAD fasting), I felt a bit shaky and anxious. Not overly so, but noticeably.

2)  Watch Nico weg, easy german, coffee break and some random videos. even if I don't understand 60% videos on the random videos, because it doesn't focus on Specific level. 

  
3) then I keep reading some random german article or newspaper. 

  
4) learning from apps just  for FUN only, such as drops or duolingo , **only for FUN** , I know duolingo is not really good for language  learning, but it is more like a refresher   

  
Reason I do self study, Is because I have my military deployment in some month. so taking coruses could be a waste now 

  
For the grammtik, I study from Basic german grammtik. 

Do you think this will do some good boost to push my level at leasst to B2? ",0,1738968936.0,German,0,0.38,False

My husband 35M and I 32F both came from broken homes so we haven‚Äôt had the best examples of how a healthy marriage should be. We have learned how to be good spouses on our own and by short bouts of marital counseling. We are honestly very happy together. Here are some things we have learned along the way: 

1. When we do have disagreements, we argue respectfully. No name calling or rude comments. We never use the word ‚ÄúDivorce‚Äù. It‚Äôs not even in our vocabulary. However, I can‚Äôt remember the last time we have had an argument. My husband and I have NEVER called each other names. 

2. We have sex often. I work in health care so my shifts are strange. I work three 12 hour shifts a week. We have sex on the four days that I have off. We constantly flirt and grab each other in the mean time. My husband knows I find him irresistible and he makes me feel sexy. It‚Äôs very important for your spouse to feel desirable by you. 

3. We set both short term and long term goals. We agreed early on in our relationship that I would go to College first and he would work. After I graduated he would then go to college and I would work. Other goals we have already accomplished are buying a house with land, certain travel destinations, and growing our savings account. Long term goals we have set are investing in real estate and things like that. I think it is important for couples to continue to work together towards a common goal. 

3. We talk about finances. After bills are paid we give each other an allowance for everyday things like fuel or if I want to go buy iced coffee or something. The rest gets distributed between our savings accounts 

4. We tell each other ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù often. If I see him taking the trash out or doing the dishes after I cook I tell him that I appreciate him. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times he has done it over the years, I still tell him that I appreciate his efforts. 

These are just a few things I can think of off of the top of my head. Does anyone else have some awesome marriage tips that can be added? I would love to hear your advice on how you keep your marriage happy and healthy! üòÅ

1ik85v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ik85v4/can_i_efficiently_improve_this_workflow_for_a/,Can I efficiently improve this workflow for a better coffee? Grinder upgrade?,"I have a Bambino Plus, and a Smart Grinder Pro. Prefer dark roast, milk coffees, and make one a day, occasionally two.

My goal when I started was to make a better coffee than could be purchased from an Australian 7-11. My thinking was, coffee shop coffees vary wildly in quality, so if I was going to make at home I needed a quality goal and may as well pick something achievable üòÇ. While 7-11 coffee is a last resort option, it is very consistent IMO and there are occasions when I‚Äôve consumed a coffee from a specialty shop and felt I would have been better off at 7-11, so that‚Äôs where I began. 

I achieved that pretty quickly and now have just been cruising along and trying out a few different beans but always coming back to the bold, dark varieties for that whack in the face caffeine hit.

Below is my workflow. I am looking for efficiency that gets a decent, drinkable result, and thinking about upgrading the grinder to a Baratza Sette Wi for the weighing, because I doubt very much I am going to find a more convenient machine than the Bambino Plus given how I‚Äôve landed so far.

1. Start steaming milk in the Bambino Plus, hottest setting with lowest foam

2. I have removed the plastic insert from the supplied portafilter, and use a single wall non pressurised basket. Attach a dosing funnel and get 13 seconds of grinds.

3. WDT tool. This tweak has made the biggest impact on the coffee for me. Recently my crappy cheap Amazon one broke and I bought the subminimal flick. Yes I know it‚Äôs gimmicky but it‚Äôs fun and magnetic, that is SO much more convenient and it has saved a few seconds, which I now spend doing more de-clumping.

4. Tap the side, use the Breville-supplied, lightweight tamp with the dosing funnel on to tamp. Thereby, achieving no or minimal mess.

5. Remove the funnel, drop in a normcore puck filter, insert the portafilter

6. Clean the milk frother wand, and then pull the shot.

I have tried:
- a heavy coffee distribution tool and tamp; but prefer the above workflow, this tamp is not compatible with the dosing funnel‚Ä¶
- bottomless portafilter, different handle.. didn‚Äôt  love it.
- I have a scale but can‚Äôt really bring myself to weigh everything given I have the time option on the grinder and the pre-set shot timer on the machine. I know, I know. Slack. But I‚Äôm being real here.

I know this is not high end uppity, but are there any other process tweaks you‚Äôd suggest I consider? I am thinking the weighed grinder and better quality/less clumpy result may be a meaningful step forward that is relatively low effort/high impact?

Every now and then, I wonder if I should upgrade the machine (end up resolving: no, the plus is extremely convenient for my lifestyle) and the coffee is decent enough for my needs.

I do spend on fresh, local specialty beans too, and try other options that I pick up every now and then whilst travelling, and can absolutely taste the nuanced differences in the beans, which makes me think I am pretty much there in terms of what I am trying to do but of course there is always scope to tighten things up (and I know, there are plenty of compromises in my current workflow).",2,1738968673.0,espresso,3,0.75,False

The elven village was every hippie‚Äôs wet dream come to life. Somehow the elves had managed to grow trees in such a way that they formed the very walls and ceilings of their houses, making every single one of the hundreds of houses Vin could make out a living work of art. Some houses were short and stout, decorated with sprawling root systems while others were thin and stretched up into the forest canopy, allowing plenty of room for their people without having to expand the borders of their village very far.

&nbsp;

**New village discovered! 400 exp gained.**

&nbsp;

Vin briefly wondered why his experience gained for discovering the elven village was higher than what he‚Äôd received for the stone village, but his attention was pulled elsewhere as the residents of the village quickly noticed their arrival.


Immediately, a handful of elves ran over and took the unconscious elf from Smohl and Puwen, rushing him away to what Vin could only assume was some sort of hospital. Two more ran over to assist Shia, but she waved them off, clutching Vin‚Äôs arm all the tighter and causing some wide eyes when the helpers realized she was being supported by a human.


The hunting party‚Äôs clear injuries, combined with their missing members, caused a small stir to spread through the village.


But that was nothing compared to their reaction to him.


News of Vin‚Äôs arrival spread like wildfire, and he‚Äôd barely taken a few dozen steps into the village before a small crowd had formed around them. Staring at the hundreds of sets of pointed teeth, Vin finally understood what the last french fry in a fast food bag must feel like. To his surprise however, most of the elves were looking at him with curiosity or shock rather than anger, as though they‚Äôd never seen a human before and were wondering what he was doing here. Though there were certainly a few that looked at him with undisguised hatred or fury, and Smohl must have noticed as he raised his voice for all to hear over the low murmuring.


‚ÄúThe outsider is being taken to the Ancient Ones!‚Äù He announced, his words echoing throughout the village. Immediately, as if he were Moses parting the Red Sea, the hundreds of elves making up the crowd split aside in an instant, opening a path for them to travel deeper into the village. Even the elves with clear disdain for him stepped out of the way, their loyalty and belief in the Ancient Ones seeming to trump their hatred for humans.


‚ÄúThese Ancient Ones must be something special,‚Äù he muttered, eyeing the many faces within the crowd as they walked through. His comment had been meant for Alka, but Shia, still clinging to his arm, must have heard him as she gave him a questioning look. Realizing his polyglot passive would have made it sound like he'd been moaning under his breath as he spoke in ghost-ese, he cleared his throat and repeated himself, in the elven tongue this time.


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs putting it lightly,‚Äù Shia chuckled, waving lazily at a few other elves in the crowd openly staring at Vin with something far too close to hunger for his liking. ‚ÄúThe Ancient Ones have been our sworn protectors for millennia now. Without them, the Sacred Forest would have been overrun centuries ago. They keep us safe, so it‚Äôs no wonder the people act the way they do. I‚Äôm actually one of the few elves who view them merely as powerful protectors. Most of these people before you venerate them as living Gods.‚Äù


The village was dense enough that it took them a couple of minutes to reach the center, and Vin could only stare in awe at what he found. It had been hidden by the numerous trees at first, but there was no hiding this natural monument for long.


Standing tall and proud in the center of the village was a monstrous conglomeration of different trees. Hundreds of unique trees had somehow been woven, spun, and grafted together to form one single, gigantic tree reaching far into the canopy. The tree had to be at least a hundred feet wide, and Vin couldn‚Äôt even begin to imagine how tall it was. He‚Äôd once visited the National Monument in D.C. and the living structure standing before him put that to shame.


‚ÄúEven if I don‚Äôt see them as Gods, I do have to admit their house is pretty impressive,‚Äù Shia said, chuckling at Vin‚Äôs expression. ‚ÄúWe call it the Tree of Ancients. For pretty obvious reasons.‚Äù


Vin managed to pull his eyes from the upper reaches of the Tree of Ancients, and he finally noticed the dozen elves surrounding the tree‚Äôs roots; each one holding a gnarled staff in their hands. Each stood tall, their many staffs planted on the ground and glowing a strong, green light as they bowed their heads in what could have been either meditation or prayer. From this distance, Vin was just able to sense the mana flow going from the elves directly into the ground, before the roots sucked it all up like a bone-dry sponge. He supposed that answered his question as to how such a gigantic plant received the nutrients it needed to survive.


‚ÄúGods and magic,‚Äù he whispered as he took in yet another miraculous sight that he never would have experienced back on Earth. Every time he stumbled onto something like this he thanked both his past self for choosing the Explorer class, and the System for making all this possible.


Smohl seemed not only content to give him a few minutes to bask in the glory of their sacred tree, but even a bit satisfied, as though despite his dislike of humans he was proud to show off his village and all its glory. Eventually however, they had to continue moving.


Before Vin knew it, he was standing at the base of the Tree of Ancients, staring up in awe at the towering structure. This close he was better able to make out where one species of tree ended and another began, but unlike the grown houses they‚Äôd passed, there were no hollows in this tree acting as natural windows. It was one unified, glorious work of art.


While the crowd had let them pass without incident, the mass of elves had followed the hunting party as they walked, even picking up more people along the way. A quick glance back showed Vin what had to be at least a few thousand elves gathered behind them, packed into every possible opening and even climbing on top of the nearby tree houses.


Clearing his throat, Smohl spoke to the Tree of Ancients. ‚ÄúOh Ancient Ones! A wandering Explorer has entered our Sacred Forest. Despite our initial hostility, he saved our party by slaying an attacking Trunkback, and has asked for an audience with you!‚Äù


*‚ÄòI don‚Äôt recall us ever actually asking for an audience with their tree God, you know. They kinda just decided all that themselves.‚Äô*


‚ÄúShush!‚Äù Vin hissed, not wanting to miss whatever was about to happen. He was glad he‚Äôd kept his eyes locked on the tree, because only moments after Smohl had finished speaking a small portion of bark at the bottom of the tree began wavering like a disrupted mirage, before a man stepped directly out of the shimmering wood.


While humanoid, the man was clearly far from human. His skin was brown and grainy, like the bark of an old oak tree stretched into a human form. His clothes were similar to the woven, interlocking leaves that the elves wore, except for the fact that his seemed to be growing out of his own bark-like skin. The whites of his eyes were instead a soft green, and the pupils a rich, deep brown that focused first on Smohl, before shifting to land on Vin. The being that could only be an Ancient One smiled, and Vin let out a sigh of relief he hadn‚Äôt realized he‚Äôd been holding when the being‚Äôs teeth were revealed to be similar to his own rather than pointed like the elves. After taking in the strange man, Vin‚Äôs eyes widened at the System notifications that popped up.

&nbsp;

**New magical beast discovered! 500 exp gained.**

&nbsp;

**New sentient race discovered! 6,000 exp gained.**

&nbsp;

**Level up! Explorer lvl 8.**

&nbsp;

**+3 Attribute points to spend.**

&nbsp;

**+1 Skill point to spend.**

&nbsp;

‚ÄúHello, young human,‚Äù the Ancient One said, his voice rich and deep for having such a thin frame, as if he were actually three times his size. ‚ÄúWelcome to the Sacred Forest.‚Äù


As Vin quickly dismissed his latest notification, he was startled by a flurry of movement all around him. Every single elf, regardless of age, gender, or any other discernible feature like the length of their braids, suddenly had their faces pressed against the ground, bowing in reverence toward the Ancient One. Even Shia, for all her talk about not seeing the Ancient Ones as Gods, had her face pressed against the soil. Seeing the panic in Vin‚Äôs face, the Ancient One let out a soft chuckle, which sounded more like branches shaking in the wind than actual laughter.


‚ÄúFear not, my young human. I don‚Äôt expect you to bow. For centuries, my people have tried to get the elves to view us less as deities and more as partners, but alas, they refuse.‚Äù As he spoke, the Ancient One gazed upon the bowing elves with a clear expression of love, like an elderly man watching a group of his grandchildren playing in his garden. ‚ÄúDo not worry. Once we have left they will loosen up and go about their day.‚Äù


With the wave of his hand, the bark of the giant tree rippled once more, and Vin found himself staring at a dark wooden door suddenly inset within the tree as though it had always been there.


‚ÄúPlease. After you.‚Äù The Ancient One said, opening the door and motioning for Vin to head in first.


‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Vin said, carefully stepping past the bowing elves and approaching the Ancient One. He certainly wasn‚Äôt about to not venture into the gigantic magic tree when invited in after all. Hoping he was concealing his manic grin of excitement, Vin stepped through the door and found himself standing inside a small but cozy sitting room.


Not surprisingly, seeing as he was inside a giant tree, the walls, floor, ceiling, and pretty much every other aspect of the room was made of wood. What was interesting however, was how much variety and creativity the Ancient Ones had managed despite that. The floor was a rich, brown lacquered wood, while the walls were more like the inside of a log cabin made from different types of tree. There was a small table growing out of the floor with two chairs that seemed to be made from small trees, their branches woven together to form the backrest. There even seemed to be some sort of kitchen attached to the side of the room with an assortment of cabinets, though Vin couldn‚Äôt even begin to guess what might be inside them.


‚ÄúPlease, have a seat,‚Äù the Ancient One said, gesturing for Vin to take one of the two chairs. ‚ÄúCare for a drink? Tea? Coffee? If it can be grown, I can provide it for you.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh, tea would be great, thank you!‚Äù Vin said, surprised by both how comfortable the living chair was and the Ancient One‚Äôs hospitality. Silence stretched across the room for a few minutes as the Ancient One prepared tea for them both. Vin was more than happy to simply look around the room, getting an inside view of the humongous tree and marveling at how magic had been used to create such a wonder.


Finally, the Ancient One joined him at the table, taking the seat across from him and placing two wooden cups filled with steaming tea in front of them. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have milk or sugar unfortunately, but let me know if you would like any honey.‚Äù


‚ÄúUh, this should be fine. Thank you,‚Äù Vin said, taking a tentative sip of the tea. It was the strangest blend of earl grey and herbal tea that he‚Äôd ever experienced, but it was tasty enough and gave him something to do besides gawk at the strange man in front of him.


Unfortunately for him, the Ancient One seemed content to wait as long as it took for Vin to finish sipping his tea, simply continuing to smile at him like a kindly old grandfather watching his favorite grandson. Eventually, Vin had to pause, and he sighed as he put down his cup. He waited a few more seconds, but when the Ancient One made no move to speak, he decided to get the ball rolling.


‚ÄúDo you mind if I ask you something?‚Äù


‚ÄúBy all means, please go ahead,‚Äù the Ancient One said, continuing to smile.


‚ÄúI can‚Äôt quite understand the mixed signals I‚Äôm getting from you and the elves about humans. When I first ran into Smohl and his party, there was an argument about whether to kill me or to sacrifice me to you. When we entered town, most of the elves looked at me more like I was an object of curiosity rather than something to be feared or hated. And you seem to have nothing against humans either. Well, that or you‚Äôre just giving me a nice last meal before the sacrifice or whatever.‚Äù


The Ancient One nodded along with his points, not speaking until Vin had finished. ‚ÄúNone of that was a question you know.‚Äù


*‚ÄòOh great, he‚Äôs doing the ‚Äòwise and annoying elder‚Äô trope. I hate those kinds of people.‚Äô*


Vin rolled his eyes, silently agreeing with Alka on this one. ‚ÄúThen I suppose I‚Äôll officially ask. Why the strange, mixed reaction toward humans?‚Äù


The Ancient One leaned back in his chair, and Vin was surprised to realize the sounds of groaning wood were coming from his body rather than the furniture. ‚ÄúThe history of the Sacred Forest stretches back countless generations, and I doubt you wish to spend the next few weeks here learning all of it. The short version is that the surrounding kingdoms, primarily made up of humans, orcs, and elemental-kin, disliked not being able to take what they wanted from the Sacred Forest, and they tried more times than you can imagine to invade. As a result, the elven warriors have fought against humans for as long as they can remember. That is bound to breed resentment, even if it is unwarranted.‚Äù


‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt share their anger?‚Äù


‚ÄúMy people live long, long lives,‚Äù the Ancient One said, chuckling. ‚ÄúWhile I admit the majority of other races I have encountered over the years have been of the raiding and pillaging sort, I have met my fair share of friendly, helpful humans who were just as awestruck by our way of life as you are. I‚Äôve been watching you since you set foot in the Sacred Forest, and allow me to give you my official thanks for saving some of my young charges from that rampaging monster.‚Äù The Ancient One stood up, his body creaking as he gave Vin a shallow bow.


‚ÄúOh, of course, no need for that!‚Äù Vin stammered, deciding to drink deeply from his cup to hide his face heating up. Nobody had ever bowed to him before, and the first person to do so was some sort of ancient half-God?


What a weird day.


Sitting back down, the Ancient One took a sip from his own cup, letting out a sigh that sounded like wind whistling through leaves. ‚ÄúNow that the pleasantries are out of the way, I‚Äôm afraid I must throw etiquette to the wayside for a moment, if that is alright.‚Äù


‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶‚Äù Vin said, trying to move his hand slightly closer to his sword hilt without the Ancient One noticing. Clearly he wasn‚Äôt as sneaky as he‚Äôd hoped, as the Ancient One simply chuckled, shaking his head.


‚ÄúOh no, you have nothing to fear. I simply have something of a large request I would like to make of you, and I‚Äôm afraid asking such after you have already done so much for my people would be considered rude, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù


‚ÄúEh, I was never really one for politeness,‚Äù Vin shrugged, trying not to let the relief show on his face. If the Ancient One decided he did want to turn him into fertilizer, there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot he‚Äôd be able to do about it after all. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the request?‚Äù


‚ÄúBefore we get to the request, there‚Äôs something you should know.‚Äù The Ancient One finally lost his smile, his expression turning serious for the first time. ‚ÄúThis bit of knowledge, however, is currently a secret from the elves. I would have to ask you for your word that you won‚Äôt share with them what I‚Äôm about to tell you.‚Äù


Vin wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just his imagination, but he swore the entire room seemed to shrink slightly, pressing in on them just a little bit more as the Ancient One waited for his answer. Gulping, he hurriedly nodded. ‚ÄúOf course! Your secret is safe with me!‚Äù


In an instant, the Ancient One‚Äôs smile returned, and Vin breathed easier as the room seemed to return to normal, no longer feeling like it was going to collapse in on itself and crush him into paste at any second. ‚ÄúExcellent! I appreciate your candor. This particular piece of information would cause nothing but worry and fear for the elves, and I‚Äôd like to prevent that for as long as possible.‚Äù


‚ÄúI totally understand,‚Äù Vin said, wondering what on Earth the ancient being sitting before him could possibly want to share with him, and how he could possibly help. Was there some super powerful monster approaching the forest? Were they running out of food? Some sort of magical virus decimating their people? Shaking his head, he pulled himself back to the here and now. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the bad news?‚Äù


‚ÄúWell you see‚Ä¶‚Äù The Ancient One took another sip of his tea, sighing in enjoyment of the rich flavor and giving Vin an almost apologetic smile.


‚ÄúAll the other Ancient Ones are dead.‚Äù


‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll soon be joining them.‚Äù
