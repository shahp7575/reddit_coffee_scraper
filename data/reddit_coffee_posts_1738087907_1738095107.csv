For those who need their memory jogging, the wife and I moved back in together recently after a separation, but she‚Äôs started casually talking to a guy from her work, and she works about 2 hours away from our home (travels there one day, stays with her female bestie a few nights while working her shifts, then travels back home).

I messaged her telling her we needed to talk. She asked what was up, and I basically said I felt super lonely every time she went away, and she needed to keep trying to get a transfer to a store closer because it was starting to affect me mentally.
She agreed and said she‚Äôll keep trying, worst case scenario she‚Äôll just look for another job closer (with the possibility of losing out on some maternity privileges, which we wanted to avoid, but you never know).

I also brought up that I know she has a guy friend from work now, but that I also knew she‚Äôd met up with him for a coffee before work, at least once that I knew of.
She told me he‚Äôs actually gay, that they talk about me all the time, and that he thinks I‚Äôm really cool (since I‚Äôm in the Army I guess). She also said I‚Äôve honestly got nothing to worry about. She was very reassuring, open and sweet.

Any ideas welcomed, thanks

Great question! Since this is a double birthday gift and your relationship with them has shifted, it‚Äôs wise to aim for something thoughtful but not overly personal‚Äîan elevated yet approachable gift they can both enjoy together or separately.

>Hello hello :)

>It's my BIL's (25) birthday next month and I'm really struggling to find a gift for him. He only ever asks for gift cards, but I'd like to give a personal gift as well, as I like giving gifts that ‚ú® spark joy ‚ú® and I would like him to feel appreciated, especially because it was a bumpy road when he became part of our family.

>His main interest is Euro Truck Simulator 2, which he has a full setup for. He's a mod, spends almost all his free time on this game and is not driving much himself, I think. He also doesn't necessarily like trucks outside of the game, afaik. I gave him a decorative licence plate with his gamertag or his community name once which was a hit but I can't think of anything that would excite him just as much.

>Apart from ETS2, he likes Fast & Furious and Squid Game. I've checked for merch for Squid game but I couldn't find anything suitable. He also only ever wears the same black clothes, so I think merch shirts are probably not the best choice.

>Any help would be appreciated!

Ah, your BIL sounds like an interesting and unique person to shop for! I love your thoughtful approach, especially since you want to make him feel appreciated. Let‚Äôs build on his interests and give him a gift that‚Äôs both personal and exciting. Here are some curated ideas within your budget (‚Ç¨30-50) that balance his love for Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2), Fast & Furious, and Squid Game while avoiding obvious merch tees:

# üöö For His Love of Euro Truck Simulator 2

1. **Custom Truck Simulator Mouse Pad** A high-quality, custom mouse pad with a design inspired by ETS2 (think trucks, highways, or even his gamertag) would be both useful and personal for his setup.
   * **Why it‚Äôs great**: Adds a personal touch to his gaming setup.
   * **Where to buy**: You can design one on [Printful](https://www.printful.com/personalized-gifts/a/index) or find customizable options on Etsy.
2. **ETS2 Steam DLC (New Map Expansion)** If he doesn‚Äôt already own the latest ETS2 expansions, gift him a **new map DLC** like ""Road to the Black Sea"" or ""Iberia.""
   * **Why it‚Äôs great**: Enhances his gaming experience with more content.
   * **Where to buy**: [Steam Gift Card (‚Ç¨30+)](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=steam+gift+card&tag=gifts-favspro-20) or purchase the DLC directly on Steam.

‚ÄúJump out of the plane and build your parachute on the way down‚Äù

It‚Äôs not because I go into things gung ho or without thinking.

(My analytical, engineer‚Äôs brain doesn‚Äôt allow for that)

I‚Äôm not reckless. I‚Äôm not a thrill seeker either.

It‚Äôs because over the years, I‚Äôve seen too many Talented AF people sit on the side lines.

These are peeps that are super smart.

They‚Äôve got HUGE potential.

Not really.

Not with the things that will make a difference to their life, income and energy.

Because all that planning and preparing‚Ä¶

It hoovers up hours of ‚Äòfree‚Äô time.

It takes up huge chunks of real estate in our minds.

But, where‚Äôs the pay off?

Without the ‚Äòdoing‚Äô part..

There isn‚Äôt any.

Remember that ROYA guy I told you about on Friday?

He didn‚Äôt just share the news about helping his Sis.

There was also a bit of ‚Äòshop‚Äô talk.

But, here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs no ‚Äòbig secret‚Äô to what he‚Äôs doing.

He thinks. He plans. He follows what we‚Äôve taught him in ROYA‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and then he takes raw, uncomfortable, jumping out of a plane kinda action.

It would have been so easy for him to get caught up in the weeds. Deliberate over finicky details. Wait for the perfect conditions to start.

Mykonos felt like a dream. The air was salty and warm, carrying with it the sounds of waves gently lapping against the shore and the laughter of people who seemed as weightless as the breeze. This place was beautiful in a way I couldn‚Äôt put into words, but it wasn‚Äôt the island that left me speechless. It was Alyssa.

If I thought she‚Äôd been breathtaking in Thailand, here she was something else entirely. Mykonos seemed to have been designed with her in mind. The windmills stood tall against the backdrop of a cobalt sky, their sails turning lazily in the breeze, and Alyssa fit perfectly into the scene. She was effortless, radiant.

The first night, though, wasn‚Äôt perfect. Alyssa got sick. It wasn‚Äôt anything serious‚Äîprobably just exhaustion from the flight and all the travel‚Äîbut it was enough to keep her in bed.

I went for a walk to let her rest. The streets of Mykonos were alive even late at night. Groups of people spilled out of bars and restaurants, their laughter echoing down the narrow cobblestone alleys. The women here were stunning, the kind of beauty that turned heads without trying, but none of it mattered.

They weren‚Äôt Alyssa.

None of them had her smile, her spark, the way she could light up a room just by existing in it. None of them could make me feel the way she did‚Äîlike I was the luckiest man in the world just to stand beside her.

When I got back to the house, she was already asleep, her face soft and peaceful in the moonlight streaming through the window. I sat down on the edge of the bed, watching her for a moment, and realized just how far I‚Äôd fallen. I‚Äôd never felt this way about anyone before.





The next morning, Alyssa was back to herself, full of energy and excitement. She wanted to explore, and I wanted nothing more than to watch her take it all in.

We wandered the winding streets, stopping at boutiques and cafes. She laughed as I tried‚Äîand failed‚Äîto pronounce half the words on the menu. She ordered gelato, her favorite, and made me hold it while she took pictures of everything, including me.

‚ÄúDo you ever stop?‚Äù I teased her, pretending to be annoyed as she angled her phone for the perfect shot.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù she said with a grin, snapping a picture of me mid-eye-roll.

The truth was, I loved it. I loved the way she captured every moment, the way she saw beauty in everything. And I loved being the one holding the camera when she asked for a picture of herself. She never had to ask twice.

That week in Mykonos was like stepping into a different world. The house we rented sat right by the water, close enough to the iconic windmills that I could hear them creak in the breeze at night. Ships and yachts dotted the horizon, their lights flickering like stars against the dark sea.

We spent our days exploring and our nights sitting on the patio, talking and watching the water. Alyssa always kept me on my toes, whether it was with her quick wit or the way she‚Äôd suddenly drag me off the couch to dance to a song playing in the background.

I remember one night in particular. We were sitting outside, the sound of the waves filling the silence between us. Alyssa had just finished her second gelato of the day‚Äîsomething she proudly called an achievement‚Äîand was leaning back in her chair, looking up at the stars.

‚ÄúThis whole trip feels like it lasted a day,‚Äù she said suddenly, her voice soft.

I nodded, understanding exactly what she meant. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it to end,‚Äù I said.

She turned to look at me, her eyes catching the light of the moon. ‚ÄúNeither do I.‚Äù

There was something in her gaze that night, something familiar but deeper than I‚Äôd seen before. It was the same look she‚Äôd given me in that bar the first night we met, the same look that had floored me in Thailand. It was Alyssa‚Äîcompletely, unapologetically Alyssa.

I didn‚Äôt know what home would hold for us, but I knew one thing for certain: As long as Alyssa was with me, home wasn‚Äôt a place. It was a feeling. And I never wanted to lose it.

# Chapter 16: Home

Fast forward six months, and it was almost my birthday‚Äîa whole year with Alyssa. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it this far, but here we were. Life felt like it was moving at the perfect pace, with Alyssa by my side.  
I remembered back to the first time I went to Alyssa‚Äôs apartment. It was cozy and simple, just like her, but there was one thing that stood out‚Äîa massive photo of New York City hanging on the wall. The skyline glittered in the frame, the towering buildings cutting through the sky like monuments to something bigger.

‚ÄúDid you take this?‚Äù I‚Äôd asked, running my fingers along the edge of the frame.

She‚Äôd laughed softly, shaking her head. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never really left the state.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything then, but I remember thinking, *I‚Äôm going to show this girl the world.*

And now, we‚Äôd done it.

In less than a year, Alyssa and I had touched every corner of the map. From Charleston to Chicago, New York to Las Vegas. From the pristine beaches of Phuket to the vibrant streets of China. Every major city in the U.S., every place I could think of that might make her smile, we‚Äôd been there.

She had this way of bringing life to every place we visited, like the world was brighter just because she was in it. Whether it was wandering the streets of Mykonos at night, holding her hand as we stood at the edge of the world, or laughing as we got lost in the crowded streets of New York, every moment with her felt monumental.

She once told me, after a day spent exploring Greece, ‚ÄúYou make me feel like I belong anywhere, Jacob.‚Äù And I couldn‚Äôt tell her then, but the truth was, it was her who made every place feel like it belonged to me.

I thought about that photo of New York often. How she‚Äôd looked at it every day, wondering what it might be like to stand beneath those towering buildings. Now I couldn‚Äôt count how many skylines we‚Äôd seen together. How many nights we‚Äôd stood side by side, staring out at some new, unfamiliar place, and making it ours.

For Alyssa, the world had been a mystery. But for me, she‚Äôd become my whole world.

Home wasn‚Äôt a place, not anymore. Home was her.

In those six months, it wasn‚Äôt about big, dramatic moments. It was about the quiet, everyday things that made life feel complete. We watched movies together every night, our legs tangled on the couch. She‚Äôd fall asleep halfway through, and I‚Äôd stay up to finish them, just so I could tell her how they ended. We got a cat‚Äîa beautiful, long-haired, part Maine Coon we named Baby Kitty. Well, we never could think of a real name, and ‚ÄúBaby Kitty‚Äù just stuck. Every time I said it, it made me laugh, and I think Alyssa secretly loved that it did. Baby Kitty had this incredible gray fur, and the way the white markings lined his eyes, it looked like he wore eyeliner better than any of us ever could. He became a part of our routine. Every night, Baby Kitty would wedge himself between us on the couch or paw at Alyssa‚Äôs arm until she gave him some attention. And somehow, he always joined in on teasing me about how hot I ran temperature-wise when we cuddled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a furnace,‚Äù she‚Äôd laugh as she shifted away, fanning herself dramatically. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre not sweating.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because I‚Äôm perfect,‚Äù I‚Äôd tease back, earning an eye roll and a grin before she‚Äôd scoot closer again, unable to resist the warmth, no matter how much she complained about it.





The six months in between felt like a lifetime and a blink. It wasn‚Äôt just time passing‚Äîit was living, really living, but together.

Everything she did, I did. Everything I did, she did.

Her business was thriving, and I was so proud of her. Every day, I made it a point to tell her just how proud I was, how much I believed in her, and how I‚Äôd always known she could do it. Because if anyone could make something out of nothing, it was Alyssa. Her drive, her vision, her ability to make everything she touched better‚Äîit amazed me. She didn‚Äôt need anyone, but she chose to share her life with me, and that made me want to be better too.

We talked about vacations we wanted to take, plans for the future, and the things we wanted to do together. It was perfect. Everything worked between us. There were no cracks in the foundation, at least none I was willing to see.





Somewhere in those six months, I realized something I‚Äôd never fully understood before. For me, ‚Äúhome‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a place. It wasn‚Äôt the walls I grew up in or the house I owned. Home was a feeling, and I felt it every time I was with Alyssa.

It hit me one night when she stayed over at my place‚Äîa rare occurrence, given that I lived in the middle of nowhere. Alyssa wasn‚Äôt shy about her distaste for my location.

‚ÄúWhy would anyone live this far from civilization?‚Äù she asked, standing on my porch and staring out at the empty road that led to my house. ‚ÄúDo you hate joy or something?‚Äù

I laughed, but deep down, I knew she was half-serious. Her world was full of energy‚Äîcity lights, bustling streets, places where something was always happening. My home, by contrast, was still and quiet, and not in the meditative way she liked.

But even though she rarely came over, when she did, my house felt alive. Her laugh filled the empty spaces. Her presence made everything brighter, warmer. And when she wasn‚Äôt there, it felt hollow, like the air had gone still.

Her apartment, on the other hand, felt like home to me. It was cozy and full of little touches that made it uniquely hers‚Äîcandles that smelled like vanilla and lavender, pillows that were somehow perfectly soft, and the occasional notebook or book left open on the coffee table. Being there felt like slipping into a place that just made sense.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she teased me one night as we sat on her couch, Baby Kitty sprawled across my lap, ‚Äúif you keep hanging around here, I‚Äôm going to start charging you rent.‚Äù

I laughed it off, but secretly, I wished I could just move in.

I never told her how much that realization scared me‚Äîhow much it meant to me that she‚Äôd unknowingly redefined what ‚Äúhome‚Äù was. But every time we were together‚Äîon her couch with Baby Kitty curled up between us, walking through the city streets, or even just sitting quietly, side by side‚ÄîI let myself feel it. She was home.



But I never asked her how she felt about us. I was too scared to. Part of me wanted to hear it‚Äîhow much she loved me, how happy she was. But another part of me was terrified she‚Äôd say something I didn‚Äôt want to hear, something that would shatter the illusion of perfection we‚Äôd built.

For now, though, I didn‚Äôt ask. I let the days roll by, savoring every laugh, every kiss, and every quiet moment with Alyssa. With Baby Kitty curled up in our laps, the world outside didn‚Äôt matter. We were making something beautiful, and for the first time in a long time, I let myself believe it could last.  
I used to wake up in the middle of the night. Actually, I did that every night. I‚Äôve never really slept well‚Äînot since the incident in the military. The nights weren‚Äôt peaceful for me; they were filled with flashes of things I didn‚Äôt want to remember, things I‚Äôd never forget no matter how much I wanted to. Sometimes I‚Äôd wake up sweating, my chest tight, the room feeling too quiet. And sometimes I‚Äôd have dreams so vivid I‚Äôd wake up crying before I even realized what was happening.

But on those nights, Alyssa was there.

She didn‚Äôt even have to be awake to make me feel better. Just knowing she was beside me, hearing her soft, steady breathing, made the memories feel farther away. I could focus on her instead of the ghosts in my head, and somehow, the pain would quiet down.

When she did wake up‚Äîwhen I‚Äôd shift too much or sigh too loudly‚Äîshe‚Äôd turn to me, her voice groggy but soft. ‚ÄúBad dream?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I‚Äôd whisper.

She‚Äôd press her hand against my chest or lace her fingers through mine, her touch grounding me in a way nothing else could. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù she‚Äôd say simply, and that was all I needed.

Sometimes she wouldn‚Äôt wake up at all. Sometimes I‚Äôd just watch her sleep, my arm draped around her, or her head resting on my chest. I‚Äôd feel the rise and fall of her breath, hear the faint little sighs she made in her sleep, and I‚Äôd wonder how I got so lucky.

She never believed me when I told her how beautiful she was, especially in those quiet, unguarded moments.

Every morning, without fail, I‚Äôd tell her, ‚ÄúYou look so pretty.‚Äù

And every morning, without fail, she‚Äôd roll her eyes and groan. ‚ÄúStop, I‚Äôm ugly right now.‚Äù

But I‚Äôd look at her‚Äîher hair messy from sleep, her face soft and relaxed‚Äîand think to myself, *You‚Äôre perfect. You don‚Äôt even know it, but you‚Äôre perfect.*

At night, when the world felt heavy and my mind was restless, she gave me something to hold onto. She was my anchor, my safe place. I‚Äôd kiss her on the forehead every night, whether she was awake or not, a small reminder to myself of how much she meant to me.

Eventually, I‚Äôd fall back to sleep, the sound of her breathing lulling me into a peace I couldn‚Äôt find on my own. But every night, before sleep finally took me, the same thought would run through my mind:

*I don‚Äôt want there to be a last anything with Alyssa.*

It scared me‚Äîhow much I needed her, how much she‚Äôd become a part of me. But at the same time, it gave me something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time: hope.

Because even on the darkest nights, when the memories came back, she was the light that made it all bearable. She didn‚Äôt just give me a reason to wake up. She gave me a reason to keep going.  
  
**Chapter 17: A Year with Miss Alyssa**

A year.

It had been a whole year since I met Alyssa, since my world turned upside down and right side up all at once. A year since the night I saw her at the bar, searching for something, and realized she was the thing I‚Äôd been looking for all along.

And what a year it had been.

I thought about how much had changed in those twelve months. How much I‚Äôd changed. Alyssa had this way of making me feel alive in a way I hadn‚Äôt before. She pulled me out of the fog I didn‚Äôt even know I was living in and showed me what it meant to truly feel. To love, to laugh, to live.

We celebrated the little things and made a routine out of the mundane. Movie nights on her couch. Baby Kitty‚Äôs antics. Her teasing me about how ‚Äústupid hot‚Äù I was when we cuddled. Every day was different, but every day felt like it had her fingerprints on it, like she left her mark on everything we did.



When her birthday rolled around, I went all out, making sure the day was as special as she was. She wasn‚Äôt the type to demand attention, but I wanted her to feel celebrated, to know how much she meant to me. I surprised her with flowers and a handwritten letter‚Äînot just a card, but pages of everything I couldn‚Äôt always say out loud.

Her reaction made it worth every second. She cried, laughing through the tears as she tried to tell me I was too much. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ridiculous,‚Äù she said, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúBut I love it.‚Äù



By the time my birthday came around, it was like we‚Äôd built our own little world. We spent it together, just the two of us, with Baby Kitty curled up between us. She teased me about getting old, and I teased her right back, calling her ‚ÄúMiss Alyssa‚Äù like I always did when I wanted to make her laugh.

And laugh she did.

But the year wasn‚Äôt just laughter and light. There were moments that tested us, moments where the cracks in my own foundation threatened to pull us under. I still woke up in the middle of the night, my chest tight with memories I couldn‚Äôt escape. And she was always there, whether awake or not, grounding me in a way nothing else could.

Alyssa had a way of making the hardest moments bearable. She didn‚Äôt try to fix me or tell me everything would be okay. She just *was* there. Her presence alone was enough to quiet the storm, even if only for a little while.

# Chapter 18: Too Good to Be True

I woke up a few days after Christmas, and it felt like any other morning. The world outside was quiet, the lingering stillness of the holiday season hanging in the air. My routine was always the same‚ÄîI‚Äôd head out to the gas station and grab an energy drink. It was a habit I picked up in the military, something that had stuck with me all these years. Alyssa knew how much they meant to me. She‚Äôd always bring them home for me throughout the year, little acts of care that meant everything.

I didn‚Äôt think much about it as I walked back through the door, energy drink in hand. The house felt warm, cozy‚Äîhome. Alyssa‚Äôs home. I headed upstairs to her room, where Baby Kitty was perched on the windowsill, looking out at the world like he always did. His long gray fur glowed faintly in the morning light, and his little white ‚Äúeyeliner‚Äù made his curious expression even cuter.

‚ÄúBabe, come look at Baby Kitty,‚Äù I called out, smiling as he turned to look at me with those big eyes.

But she didn‚Äôt come over. She didn‚Äôt look.

She was sitting on the edge of the bed, her posture slouched, her head in her hands.

‚ÄúAlyssa?‚Äù I asked, my voice soft, but something in me already knew. The air felt different, heavier.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer at first, just stayed there, bent over, her hands pressing against her face like she was trying to hold herself together.

‚ÄúMy stomach hurts,‚Äù she said finally, her voice shaky. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just her stomach. I could feel it in the room, the way the air seemed to crackle with tension. Something was wrong‚Äî*really* wrong.

I stood there frozen, watching her, waiting for her to say something else, to tell me what was going on. She lifted her head slightly, her eyes red and watery.

‚ÄúJacob,‚Äù she said, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore. I just can‚Äôt.‚Äù

The words hit me like a freight train. My chest tightened, my breath caught in my throat, and for a moment, the world around me went silent.

It was like everything‚Äîthe life we‚Äôd built together, the plans we‚Äôd made, the future I‚Äôd seen so clearly with her‚Äîrushed through my mind all at once. I felt it all in that single moment.

People say your life flashes before your eyes right before you die. That‚Äôs what it felt like. Except it wasn‚Äôt my past; it was Alyssa. Every memory, every feeling, every laugh, every touch‚Äîall of it collided in my chest, and then, just like that, it was gone.

I didn‚Äôt know if I was angry or devastated. Sometimes when I‚Äôm really sad, it comes out as anger, and this was one of those times.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I managed to say, my voice tight and strained.

She didn‚Äôt answer right away. She just sat there, her tears falling freely now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about it,‚Äù she said eventually, her words like daggers. ‚ÄúI love you, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm *in* love with you. And I don‚Äôt know if I can be.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember what I said after that. The conversation is a blur, like static in my mind. We talked for what felt like hours, but the words didn‚Äôt matter. None of it mattered. I was losing her, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

But somehow, like I always could, I convinced her to let me stay one more night. Just one more night.

We acted like it didn‚Äôt happen. Like we hadn‚Äôt just shattered something between us. For that one night, we held onto what we had, pretending the end wasn‚Äôt already written.

The next morning, part of me hoped she‚Äôd forget about the conversation, that we could move forward like nothing had happened. But I should‚Äôve known better. Not with Miss Alyssa.

It was New Year‚Äôs Eve now, and I was excited to start the new year with her. I wanted a fresh start, to leave behind the pain of the day before. I shyly asked about New Year‚Äôs Eve plans, but her response shattered what little hope I had left.

‚ÄúI thought you were going home,‚Äù she said, her voice flat.

‚ÄúWhy would I go home?‚Äù I asked, my stomach twisting.

She sighed, looking away. ‚ÄúJacob, I‚Äôve been thinking about it. About us. I don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore.‚Äù

Her words cut deep, deeper than I thought anything could.

I‚Äôd spent the last year pouring my heart into her, into us. I thought everything was great. I didn‚Äôt see an issue‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt *ask* about an issue, because I was too scared to hear the answer. And now it was too late.

The iPad I‚Äôd gotten her for Christmas was sitting nearby, still in its box. She‚Äôd wanted it for months, and I‚Äôd been so excited to give it to her. But in that moment, it felt like a cruel reminder of everything I couldn‚Äôt fix.

I grabbed it, the anger bubbling to the surface.

‚ÄúI got this for you,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúAnd now this?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say anything, and that only made it worse. I snapped.

I said hurtful things, things I didn‚Äôt mean but needed to say. Because I knew this time she was serious. And the only way I‚Äôd never talk to her again was if she *never* wanted to talk to me again. I had to make her hate me. I didn‚Äôt want to, but I had to.

I left.

I walked out of her apartment, down the stairs, and into my car. I sat there for ten minutes, crying and punching the steering wheel, my mind racing with everything I wanted to say but couldn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt want to leave. I didn‚Äôt want this to be the last time I left Alyssa‚Äôs.

But I knew it was.  
  
I sat in the car outside Alyssa‚Äôs apartment for what felt like an eternity, staring blankly at the dashboard as the weight of it all pressed down on me. My chest felt tight, my mind racing with a hundred different thoughts, none of them leading anywhere good.

I couldn‚Äôt sit there any longer. I needed to move, to do something‚Äîanything‚Äîto stop the ache in my chest. I reached for my phone and dialed Anthony, my closest friend, someone who had been there through everything, including the loss of Winters.

‚ÄúPack your bags,‚Äù I said, my voice raw. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to Nashville.‚Äù

Anthony didn‚Äôt ask why or push for an explanation. He just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be ready in twenty.‚Äù That was Anthony‚Äîalways down for anything, always there when I needed him most.

The drive to Nashville was a blur. The highway stretched out endlessly before me, the hum of the tires against the pavement the only sound in the car. Anthony sat quietly in the passenger seat, sensing that I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk.

When we got there, the city was as beautiful as ever‚Äîlights reflecting off the water, music spilling out of every bar and restaurant, the streets alive with energy. But it didn‚Äôt feel the same.

There was something missing.

Alyssa.

I tried to ignore the hollow feeling in my chest, the way every corner of the city seemed to remind me of her. I was trying to run away from her, but no matter how far I went, she was still there, lingering in every quiet moment, every stray thought.

We wandered the streets, letting the night carry us wherever it wanted to. I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything, just trying to outrun the pain, even if only for a little while.

# Part 2: A Hollow Embrace

There was a girl in Nashville‚Äîa beautiful girl whose name I won‚Äôt say. She just so happened to be in town at the same time, and when I saw her, the thought crossed my mind: *Maybe this is what I need.*

People always say the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. I‚Äôd never believed it, but I was desperate. Desperate to forget Alyssa, to erase the way her name echoed in my mind, to stop seeing her in every shadow.

The girl was stunning, objectively beautiful in every way, and she was interested. That should have been enough. But it wasn‚Äôt.

I went through the motions‚Äîtalking, flirting, pretending to be present. She smiled at me, laughed at my jokes, touched my arm in that way people do when they‚Äôre testing the waters. And I let her.

That night, we ended up in her hotel room.

As I lay there with her, my mind betrayed me. I wasn‚Äôt present. I wasn‚Äôt even there. All I could think about was Alyssa.

There was a scene in a show Alyssa and I used to watch together, one of the many little rituals we‚Äôd built over the past year. The main character‚Äîa broken man, much like me‚Äîwas a World War I veteran who had seen too much, lost too much. He built a life for himself, a business, and somehow, he found love in the middle of all that darkness. But then his wife died, and everything fell apart.

In one scene, the man tries to move on, tries to find solace in the arms of another woman. They sleep together, but the whole time, his eyes are distant, blank. He‚Äôs not looking at her‚Äîhe‚Äôs looking through her. You can see it in his face, the way his thoughts are somewhere else entirely.

That‚Äôs how I felt.

As the girl touched me, kissed me, I wasn‚Äôt there. I was staring through her, lost in the memory of Alyssa. The way her hair fell across her face when she laughed, the way her eyes lit up when she talked about something she loved, the way she looked at me like I was the only person in the world who mattered.

This girl wasn‚Äôt Alyssa. She could never be Alyssa.

And I hated myself for even trying.

When it was over, I lay there in the dark, staring at the ceiling, the weight of what I‚Äôd done settling over me like a heavy blanket. I thought it would help, that maybe it would dull the pain, but it didn‚Äôt. If anything, it made it worse.

I wanted to go home. Not to my house, but to Alyssa‚Äôs apartment. To the girl I called sweetheart.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

I had pushed her away, maybe for good this time, and the thought of it tore me apart.

I left Nashville the next morning, the city feeling more foreign than ever. Anthony tried to cheer me up on the drive back, but his words barely registered. All I could think about was Alyssa.

And how nothing‚Äînot Nashville, not another girl, not even the passage of time‚Äîcould ever make me forget her.",1,1738094027.0,love,2,1.0,False

I think it's inevitable now.,"We have had the elders up our ass ever since we stopped going 2.5yrs ago, after a very gradual fade during covid. It all started with my side of the family ratting that we had done Halloween that year. Then the following year, same shit, but this time it was my husbands family. Well today I go to check the mail, and surprise surprise, there's a letter from the elders in the hall we went to. 

Apparently someone told them we celebrated Christmas last month, and now they have set up a judicial meeting for this Friday. 

Not only that, but on Sunday my dad asks if I want to get a coffee with him this week, me thinking he actually wants to spend time with his daughter... NOPE then he throws the curve ball that a new elder in the hall would like to ""tag along to meet me"". üôÑ
I actually just recently went over to speak to my parents about my stance on things, because the only time I heard from them were texts sending me an article they're studying. So I asked if they even want a relationship with me and my little family, religion aside. They essentially said yes, but if get labeled by the organization as disfellowshipped, or if I were to disassociate myself, then they will cut us off. 

If we don't attend this meeting, do you think they will just disfellowship us anyways? I'm torn about going and just getting this shit done with, or just ignoring them again. My husband is saying we should just ignore them.

>I wanna get gifts for my friends in a few months, but cannot really decide what I should give them.

>For context they are furry friends, so it's more of a character thingie, I asked a few things of them what they got and turns out they never got bleach painted clothes even though they find it cool. I was also thinking about papercraft sculpts or even small air dry ones, any ideas that could work the best? (another context is that they are a couple, so that might also spark some ideas)

>thanks in advance :D

You‚Äôve already got some amazing and creative ideas brewing, and I love the effort you‚Äôre putting into this! Crafty, handmade gifts not only save money but are also super meaningful, especially for people with unique interests like your furry friends. Here‚Äôs a brainstorm of DIY gift ideas that are affordable, creative, and tailored to their love for their characters and couple dynamic:

# 1. Bleach-Painted Clothes (Custom Character Designs)

* Use bleach to create custom designs on T-shirts, hoodies, or tote bags based on their furry characters or shared themes (e.g., matching or complementary designs for the couple).
* **How to do it**: Grab dark-colored clothing from a thrift shop, sketch out designs with chalk or stencils, and use a paintbrush or spray bottle with bleach to ""paint"" the design. Add their fursona names, paw prints, or symbols they love.
* **Why it‚Äôs special**: It‚Äôs wearable, personalized, and they‚Äôve said they‚Äôd love it!

# 2. Papercraft Sculptures of Their Fursonas

* Create papercraft sculptures of their characters or even a ""couple sculpture"" with both characters together.
* **How to do it**: Use free papercraft templates online (like Pepakura or 3D paper modeling resources), or design your own simple geometric shapes. Decorate with colors and patterns that match their fursonas.
* **Why it‚Äôs special**: It‚Äôs inexpensive but highly creative and feels like a mini art piece made just for them.

# 3. Air-Dry Clay Sculptures (Mini Fursona Figures)

* Sculpt small chibi versions of their fursonas, or something meaningful like their favorite animal holding hands or cuddling.
* **How to do it**: Air-dry clay is affordable and easy to use, and you can paint the figures once they‚Äôre dry. Add small details like fur patterns or accessories they‚Äôd recognize from their characters.
* **Why it‚Äôs special**: It‚Äôs super personal and can sit on a shelf as a cute keepsake!

# 4. Matching Friendship Bracelets with a Furry Twist

The restaurant was dimly lit, with soft jazz playing in the background and the faint clinking of silverware echoing through the air. We‚Äôd spent the day exploring a part of the city neither of us had been to before, laughing, taking pictures, and soaking in the moment. But by the time we sat down to eat, something had shifted.

Alyssa was quiet, too quiet, stirring her drink absently as she avoided meeting my eyes.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my tone light.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said quickly, her voice clipped.

I raised an eyebrow, leaning forward. ‚ÄúCome on, Pretty Girl. I know you better than that.‚Äù

She finally looked up, her eyes narrowing slightly. ‚ÄúWhy did you change my order?‚Äù

I blinked, caught off guard. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe noodles,‚Äù she said, gesturing at the plate in front of her. ‚ÄúI asked for the spicy ones, and you ordered the mild ones instead.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you said you didn‚Äôt want it too spicy,‚Äù I said, frowning.

Her jaw tightened, and she crossed her arms. ‚ÄúYou thought. Or you decided for me?‚Äù

The accusation in her tone stung more than I wanted to admit.

‚ÄúI was trying to help,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice calm. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt usually like super spicy food, so I figured‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the point,‚Äù she interrupted, her voice rising slightly. ‚ÄúThe point is, you didn‚Äôt ask. You just‚Ä¶ decided. Like you always do.‚Äù

I stared at her, trying to process what was happening. This wasn‚Äôt about the noodles. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúWhere is this coming from?‚Äù I asked, my voice sharper than I intended.

She didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, she grabbed her purse and stood up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going back to the apartment,‚Äù she said, her voice tight. ‚ÄúEnjoy your dinner.‚Äù

And just like that, she was gone.





The walk back to the apartment was a blur. By the time I got there, the sun was dipping below the horizon, casting the city in shades of orange and pink. The view from our floor-to-ceiling windows was breathtaking, but I barely noticed it.

Alyssa was standing by the window, her arms crossed as she stared out at the city below.

‚ÄúYou want to tell me what that was about?‚Äù I asked as I closed the door behind me.

She didn‚Äôt turn around. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúTry me,‚Äù I said, my frustration bubbling to the surface.

She finally turned, her eyes flashing with a mix of anger and hurt. ‚ÄúI feel like you‚Äôre hiding something, Jacob. Like there‚Äôs this part of you I can‚Äôt reach no matter how hard I try.‚Äù

I froze, her words hitting far too close to home.

‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm hiding something?‚Äù I asked, my voice low. ‚ÄúWhere is this even coming from?‚Äù

She shook her head, her arms tightening around herself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the little things. The way you brush off questions, or the way you act like you always have to be in control. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Like you don‚Äôt trust me enough to let me in.‚Äù

Her words cut deeper than I wanted to admit.





And that‚Äôs when my ego got the better of me.

‚ÄúIf I wanted to lie to you,‚Äù I said, my voice sharper than I intended, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd never find out, Miss Alyssa.‚Äù

The second the words left my mouth, I knew I‚Äôd messed up.

Her eyes widened, and for a moment, she just stared at me, stunned.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she said finally, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou really just said that.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to respond, to take it back, but nothing came out.

‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù she said, turning back to the window. ‚ÄúI knew there was something.‚Äù

My chest tightened, and I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúAlyssa‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she said sharply, cutting me off.

But I couldn‚Äôt let it end like that.

‚ÄúSit with me,‚Äù I said, my voice softer now. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

She turned to face me again, her arms still crossed. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I need to tell you something,‚Äù I said, my throat tightening. ‚ÄúAnd I need you to be close enough to slap me, because I deserve it.‚Äù

She hesitated, her expression unreadable, before finally sitting down on the edge of the bed.

I sat beside her, my hands trembling as I ran them through my hair. I didn‚Äôt know where to start, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep it inside anymore.

‚ÄúAlyssa,‚Äù I began, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt told you.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed slightly, but she didn‚Äôt say anything.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to look her in the eyes. ‚ÄúWhen we first met‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt exactly single.‚Äù

Her face went pale, and for a moment, I thought she might actually slap me.

‚ÄúI was with someone,‚Äù I continued quickly, before she could respond. ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt the same. It wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ what we have. And I ended it. For you. Because I knew, from the moment I met you, that you were the one I wanted.‚Äù

The silence that followed was deafening.

‚ÄúYou lied to me,‚Äù she said finally, her voice barely audible.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you because I was scared of losing you,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

Her eyes filled with tears, but she didn‚Äôt look away. ‚ÄúDo you have any idea how much this hurts?‚Äù

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can forgive you for this,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling.

I reached for her hand, but she pulled away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do whatever it takes to fix this,‚Äù I said desperately. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prove to you that I‚Äôm all in, Alyssa. Just‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt walk away.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt respond.

She just stared out at the city, her tears falling silently as the first stars appeared in the night sky.  
The silence stretched between us like a chasm, filled with the weight of all the words I hadn‚Äôt said. Alyssa sat on the edge of the bed, her hands gripping the edge tightly, her knuckles white. I could see the hurt in her eyes, the disbelief, and the heartbreak that I‚Äôd caused.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a bad person,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling. It sounded weak even to my own ears, but I needed her to believe it. ‚ÄúI know it might not seem like it right now, but I‚Äôm not. I just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve made mistakes. I‚Äôve been scared.‚Äù

Her tears had stopped, but her cheeks were still damp. She looked at me with an expression I couldn‚Äôt quite place‚Äîwas it anger? Sadness? Or something in between?

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say to that,‚Äù she said finally, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúYou lied to me. You let me believe you were someone you weren‚Äôt. How am I supposed to trust you now?‚Äù

Her words hit like a punch to the gut, but I forced myself to stay calm. If I let my ego or fear take over now, I‚Äôd lose her for good.

‚ÄúI need to tell you everything,‚Äù I said, my voice firmer this time. ‚ÄúNot just about her. About‚Ä¶ everything. You deserve to know who I really am.‚Äù

She looked at me for a long moment before finally nodding. ‚ÄúOkay. Talk.‚Äù

I sat down on the floor in front of her, needing to be lower, needing her to see that I was baring myself completely. I started with my cousin, the one person who had always been a touchstone for me, even when life got unbearable.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always thought of my cousin in hard times,‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the only person who‚Äôs seen the real me. He always seemed like he didn‚Äôt care, like nothing could touch him. And I guess I tried to be like that‚Äîunbothered, invincible. But I‚Äôm not.‚Äù

I told her about how I‚Äôd grown up, about the walls I‚Äôd built to protect myself, and how those walls had kept people out. I told her about the guilt I carried for my past decisions, about how I‚Äôd hurt people without meaning to.

And then I told her about the moment I met her.

‚ÄúYou changed everything, Alyssa,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúYou made me feel alive again. But I was so afraid of screwing it up that I ended up doing exactly that. I kept things from you because I was scared you‚Äôd see the worst in me and leave.‚Äù

She stayed silent, but her eyes softened slightly.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you about her because I didn‚Äôt know how to,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt serious. It wasn‚Äôt anything close to what we have. And I ended it the second I realized how I felt about you. But that doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact that I didn‚Äôt tell you. I just‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want to lose you.‚Äù

Her lip quivered, and before I could stop myself, I reached for her hand. This time, she let me take it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúFor all of it.‚Äù

Her tears started again, silently this time, and I felt my own eyes burn.

‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve told me,‚Äù she said, her voice barely audible.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, squeezing her hand. ‚ÄúI know, and I was wrong. But you need to know, Alyssa, that you‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôve ever felt this way about. You‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôve ever wanted to open up to like this.‚Äù

And then, slowly, I started telling her everything‚Äîthings I‚Äôd never told anyone. I told her about my fears, my regrets, my dreams, and my failures. I told her about the nights I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I was so terrified of losing her, and about how meeting her had been the best thing that had ever happened to me.

She listened, really listened, her hand never leaving mine.

At some point, I stopped talking, and she pulled me into a hug. It wasn‚Äôt a soft or tentative hug‚Äîit was fierce, almost desperate, like she was holding on for dear life.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can forget what you said,‚Äù she whispered, her face buried in my chest.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve that. But if you give me another chance, I‚Äôll prove to you every single day that I‚Äôm the man you think I am‚Äîthe man I want to be for you.‚Äù

We stayed like that for what felt like hours, just holding each other. Eventually, we lay down on the bed, and I kept talking, spilling everything I‚Äôd kept inside for so long.

By the time I finished, the city outside was quiet, the lights casting a soft glow into the room. Alyssa was curled up next to me, her head on my chest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you told me,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBut Jacob‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt do that to me again. You can‚Äôt shut me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I promised, stroking her hair. ‚ÄúNever again.‚Äù

We fell asleep like that, tangled together, the weight of my secrets finally lifted.





The next morning, we acted like nothing had happened. We packed our bags, checked out of the apartment, and headed to the airport. As we boarded the flight to Thailand, I glanced at Alyssa, and she gave me a small, tired smile.

I knew things weren‚Äôt completely okay yet. There was still work to do, still trust to rebuild. But for the first time, I felt like we were on the same page.

And as the plane took off, I couldn‚Äôt help but think that maybe, just maybe, we‚Äôd make it through this storm together.

# Chapter 14: Firsts, Every Time

Our time in Phuket felt like a dream. The hotel was stunning, with floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the turquoise waters and the flickering city lights. Every corner of the place seemed built for beauty, much like Alyssa herself.

On the first day, we wandered through the bustling streets, weaving through colorful market stalls. Alyssa loved shopping‚Äîit was one of her favorite things‚Äîand I‚Äôd learned by now to just enjoy watching her in her element.  
  
She had this way of finding the perfect thing in a sea of choices, like she was drawn to it. In one of the first stores we walked into, she found this dress.

It was hanging in the corner of a tiny shop, shimmering under the fluorescent lights. The fabric was sparkly gray, the same shade as the shirt she wore the first day I saw her. She reached for it, running her fingers over the material with a curious smile.

‚ÄúTry it on,‚Äù I urged, already knowing it would look perfect on her.

She rolled her eyes playfully but didn‚Äôt argue. When she stepped out of the fitting room, my breath caught in my throat.

The dress fit her like it had been made for her. It hugged her curves in all the right ways, falling just above her knees. The shimmer caught the light, reflecting against her skin, and for a moment, I was back in that bar the first night we met, seeing her for the first time all over again.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù she asked, spinning slightly.

I just stared at her, speechless. She raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúOkay, now you‚Äôre scaring me,‚Äù she said with a laugh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful,‚Äù I finally managed. ‚ÄúI mean, you‚Äôre always beautiful, but this‚Ä¶ This is unfair.‚Äù

She blushed, rolling her eyes again, but I could tell she loved it. We bought the dress, and for the rest of the day, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how lucky I was to be the one standing next to her.





The next few days were magical. We rode motorbikes along the coastline, stopping at secluded beaches and roadside food stalls. Every moment with Alyssa felt new and exciting, like unwrapping a gift I never knew I needed.

But, as always, she found a way to break the perfect silence.

On the third night, we were back at the hotel. She‚Äôd changed into that gray dress again, and we were sitting by the window, watching the city lights sparkle. It was quiet, just the sound of the ocean in the distance and the occasional hum of traffic below.

And then, out of nowhere, she said, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I really dodged a bullet with you.‚Äù

Her words sliced through the stillness. I turned to her, confused. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

She shrugged, looking out the window. ‚ÄúI mean, with how we started. If I hadn‚Äôt kept you in check, maybe I‚Äôd just be another story.‚Äù

The weight of what she was saying hit me immediately. She was talking about China, about Sierra, about the way we began.

I leaned forward, trying to catch her eye. ‚ÄúAlyssa, no,‚Äù I said firmly.

She finally turned to me, her expression guarded. ‚ÄúYou cheated on her with me. What‚Äôs to say you wouldn‚Äôt do the same to me?‚Äù

The words stung. I felt a surge of guilt, but also frustration.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not who I am,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat happened back then‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt in love with her. I was lost, Alyssa. But you‚Äî‚Äù I paused, gathering my thoughts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different. You‚Äôre everything.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say anything, her gaze drifting back to the window.

I stood up, pacing the room, the tension building. ‚ÄúI need you to believe me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBecause if there‚Äôs one thing I know, it‚Äôs that I would never hurt you. Not like that. Not ever.‚Äù

For a long moment, she didn‚Äôt move. Then she looked up at me, her eyes softer now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúTo let go of the fear. To trust that‚Ä¶ this is real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is real,‚Äù I said, sitting beside her. I took her hand in mine. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just some chapter in my story, Alyssa. You‚Äôre the whole book.‚Äù

Her lips quivered, and for the first time, I saw her walls crumble completely. She leaned into me, her head resting on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI want to believe you,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúThen do,‚Äù I said softly.

She pulled back slightly, just enough to look at me. And there it was‚Äîthe look I‚Äôd seen the first time I met her, the one she gave me over coffee, the one that stopped the world around us. It wasn‚Äôt just her eyes, though they glimmered with that familiar fire. It was the vulnerability, the trust, the intensity of someone fully giving themselves to you.

The moment stretched between us, quiet and electric.

She leaned in, and I met her halfway. When our lips touched, it was like that first night all over again‚Äîraw and new and alive. My hands found her waist, and she slid into my lap, her dress shimmering like liquid silver in the low light.

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she whispered between kisses, her voice shaky but sure.

I cupped her face, brushing a strand of hair from her cheek. ‚ÄúI love you too. Always.‚Äù

And that night, in that room overlooking the city, we erased every doubt and fear. Nothing else mattered‚Äîjust her, and me, and the way we fit together like we were always meant to.

The restaurant was dimly lit, with soft jazz playing in the background and the faint clinking of silverware echoing through the air.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she said sharply, cutting me off.

But I couldn‚Äôt let it end like that.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a bad person,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling. It sounded weak even to my own ears, but I needed her to believe it. ‚ÄúI know it might not seem like it right now, but I‚Äôm not. I just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve made mistakes. I‚Äôve been scared.‚Äù

Her tears had stopped, but her cheeks were still damp. She looked at me with an expression I couldn‚Äôt quite place‚Äîwas it anger? Sadness? Or something in between?

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say to that,‚Äù she said finally, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúYou lied to me. You let me believe you were someone you weren‚Äôt. How am I supposed to trust you now?‚Äù

Her words hit like a punch to the gut, but I forced myself to stay calm. If I let my ego or fear take over now, I‚Äôd lose her for good.

‚ÄúI need to tell you everything,‚Äù I said, my voice firmer this time. ‚ÄúNot just about her. About‚Ä¶ everything. You deserve to know who I really am.‚Äù

She looked at me for a long moment before finally nodding. ‚ÄúOkay. Talk.‚Äù

I sat down on the floor in front of her, needing to be lower, needing her to see that I was baring myself completely. I started with my cousin, the one person who had always been a touchstone for me, even when life got unbearable.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always thought of my cousin in hard times,‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the only person who‚Äôs seen the real me. He always seemed like he didn‚Äôt care, like nothing could touch him. And I guess I tried to be like that‚Äîunbothered, invincible. But I‚Äôm not.‚Äù

I told her about how I‚Äôd grown up, about the walls I‚Äôd built to protect myself, and how those walls had kept people out. I told her about the guilt I carried for my past decisions, about how I‚Äôd hurt people without meaning to.

And then I told her about the moment I met her.

‚ÄúYou changed everything, Alyssa,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúYou made me feel alive again. But I was so afraid of screwing it up that I ended up doing exactly that. I kept things from you because I was scared you‚Äôd see the worst in me and leave.‚Äù

She stayed silent, but her eyes softened slightly.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you about her because I didn‚Äôt know how to,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt serious. It wasn‚Äôt anything close to what we have. And I ended it the second I realized how I felt about you. But that doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact that I didn‚Äôt tell you. I just‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt want to lose you.‚Äù

Her lip quivered, and before I could stop myself, I reached for her hand. This time, she let me take it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúFor all of it.‚Äù

Her tears started again, silently this time, and I felt my own eyes burn.

‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve told me,‚Äù she said, her voice barely audible.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, squeezing her hand. ‚ÄúI know, and I was wrong. But you need to know, Alyssa, that you‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôve ever felt this way about. You‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôve ever wanted to open up to like this.‚Äù

And then, slowly, I started telling her everything‚Äîthings I‚Äôd never told anyone. I told her about my fears, my regrets, my dreams, and my failures. I told her about the nights I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I was so terrified of losing her, and about how meeting her had been the best thing that had ever happened to me.

She listened, really listened, her hand never leaving mine.

At some point, I stopped talking, and she pulled me into a hug. It wasn‚Äôt a soft or tentative hug‚Äîit was fierce, almost desperate, like she was holding on for dear life.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can forget what you said,‚Äù she whispered, her face buried in my chest.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve that. But if you give me another chance, I‚Äôll prove to you every single day that I‚Äôm the man you think I am‚Äîthe man I want to be for you.‚Äù

We stayed like that for what felt like hours, just holding each other. Eventually, we lay down on the bed, and I kept talking, spilling everything I‚Äôd kept inside for so long.

By the time I finished, the city outside was quiet, the lights casting a soft glow into the room. Alyssa was curled up next to me, her head on my chest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you told me,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBut Jacob‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt do that to me again. You can‚Äôt shut me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I promised, stroking her hair. ‚ÄúNever again.‚Äù

We fell asleep like that, tangled together, the weight of my secrets finally lifted.





The next morning, we acted like nothing had happened. We packed our bags, checked out of the apartment, and headed to the airport. As we boarded the flight to Thailand, I glanced at Alyssa, and she gave me a small, tired smile.

I knew things weren‚Äôt completely okay yet. There was still work to do, still trust to rebuild. But for the first time, I felt like we were on the same page.

And as the plane took off, I couldn‚Äôt help but think that maybe, just maybe, we‚Äôd make it through this storm together.

# Chapter 14: Firsts, Every Time

Our time in Phuket felt like a dream. The hotel was stunning, with floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the turquoise waters and the flickering city lights. Every corner of the place seemed built for beauty, much like Alyssa herself.

On the first day, we wandered through the bustling streets, weaving through colorful market stalls. Alyssa loved shopping‚Äîit was one of her favorite things‚Äîand I‚Äôd learned by now to just enjoy watching her in her element.  
  
She had this way of finding the perfect thing in a sea of choices, like she was drawn to it. In one of the first stores we walked into, she found this dress.

It was hanging in the corner of a tiny shop, shimmering under the fluorescent lights. The fabric was sparkly gray, the same shade as the shirt she wore the first day I saw her. She reached for it, running her fingers over the material with a curious smile.

‚ÄúTry it on,‚Äù I urged, already knowing it would look perfect on her.

She rolled her eyes playfully but didn‚Äôt argue. When she stepped out of the fitting room, my breath caught in my throat.

The dress fit her like it had been made for her. It hugged her curves in all the right ways, falling just above her knees. The shimmer caught the light, reflecting against her skin, and for a moment, I was back in that bar the first night we met, seeing her for the first time all over again.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù she asked, spinning slightly.

I just stared at her, speechless. She raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúOkay, now you‚Äôre scaring me,‚Äù she said with a laugh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful,‚Äù I finally managed. ‚ÄúI mean, you‚Äôre always beautiful, but this‚Ä¶ This is unfair.‚Äù

She blushed, rolling her eyes again, but I could tell she loved it. We bought the dress, and for the rest of the day, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how lucky I was to be the one standing next to her.





The next few days were magical. We rode motorbikes along the coastline, stopping at secluded beaches and roadside food stalls. Every moment with Alyssa felt new and exciting, like unwrapping a gift I never knew I needed.

But, as always, she found a way to break the perfect silence.

On the third night, we were back at the hotel. She‚Äôd changed into that gray dress again, and we were sitting by the window, watching the city lights sparkle. It was quiet, just the sound of the ocean in the distance and the occasional hum of traffic below.

And then, out of nowhere, she said, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I really dodged a bullet with you.‚Äù

Her words sliced through the stillness. I turned to her, confused. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

She shrugged, looking out the window. ‚ÄúI mean, with how we started. If I hadn‚Äôt kept you in check, maybe I‚Äôd just be another story.‚Äù

The weight of what she was saying hit me immediately. She was talking about China, about Sierra, about the way we began.

I leaned forward, trying to catch her eye. ‚ÄúAlyssa, no,‚Äù I said firmly.

She finally turned to me, her expression guarded. ‚ÄúYou cheated on her with me. What‚Äôs to say you wouldn‚Äôt do the same to me?‚Äù

The words stung. I felt a surge of guilt, but also frustration.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not who I am,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat happened back then‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt in love with her. I was lost, Alyssa. But you‚Äî‚Äù I paused, gathering my thoughts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different. You‚Äôre everything.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say anything, her gaze drifting back to the window.

I stood up, pacing the room, the tension building. ‚ÄúI need you to believe me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBecause if there‚Äôs one thing I know, it‚Äôs that I would never hurt you. Not like that. Not ever.‚Äù

For a long moment, she didn‚Äôt move. Then she looked up at me, her eyes softer now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúTo let go of the fear. To trust that‚Ä¶ this is real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is real,‚Äù I said, sitting beside her. I took her hand in mine. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just some chapter in my story, Alyssa. You‚Äôre the whole book.‚Äù

Her lips quivered, and for the first time, I saw her walls crumble completely. She leaned into me, her head resting on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI want to believe you,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúThen do,‚Äù I said softly.

She pulled back slightly, just enough to look at me. And there it was‚Äîthe look I‚Äôd seen the first time I met her, the one she gave me over coffee, the one that stopped the world around us. It wasn‚Äôt just her eyes, though they glimmered with that familiar fire. It was the vulnerability, the trust, the intensity of someone fully giving themselves to you.

The moment stretched between us, quiet and electric.

She leaned in, and I met her halfway. When our lips touched, it was like that first night all over again‚Äîraw and new and alive. My hands found her waist, and she slid into my lap, her dress shimmering like liquid silver in the low light.

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she whispered between kisses, her voice shaky but sure.

I cupped her face, brushing a strand of hair from her cheek. ‚ÄúI love you too. Always.‚Äù

And that night, in that room overlooking the city, we erased every doubt and fear. Nothing else mattered‚Äîjust her, and me, and the way we fit together like we were always meant to.",2,1738093741.0,love,2,1.0,False
1icafsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramType2/comments/1icafsp/how_to_understand_if_type_2_wants_to_be_friends/,How to understand if type 2 wants to be friends or are just being polite?,"**TL;DR** What are some clear signs that an 2w3 sp/so is interested in a friendship vs they say yes when you ask them out, out of (subconscious) obligation to meet other people's needs?

**Long version with context:**

So, I am a 9w1 sx/sp in my mid-thirties trying to put effort into building more meaningful friendships.  
  
I met this person at work who is a 2w3 (sp/so from my observations). I would describe him as healthy, very very strict with boundary setting (after learning from past mistakes in relationships and with family), but like, he always asks for permission to give advice and seems to be very mindful of not overstepping. He's done the work, he's self-aware, but I do think he still has a tough time understanding when he's overextending and recognizing his own needs, and he told me he struggles to understand his emotions. I really really like him, and I thought we were kinda becoming friends, but lately I am wondering if I misunderstood his kindness and if I should back off. 

  
He initially was my manager and he helped me tremendously in building self-confidence and seeing my strenghts, I never met anyone as good at affirming people. After nearly a year he changed roles but we kept up our walks/coffees/daily chats, even though I started noticing that I was always the one initiating them. It was like, if I asked he always said yes, he always seemed to enjoy the exchanges, and during our conversations he shared extremely personal things (mental health, childhood stuff, relationship stuff), always in small bites and without much detail, and always framed as ""teaching"" moments (like: I also once went through this, I get how you feel, this is what I learnt, this is my advice). But he never really sought me out. It was also a rough time for him, so it was mostly me checking in on how he was doing and asking him to catch up, but he was always very quick in addressing it and moving the focus of conversation on me, which I guess is very type 2 and I didn't think too much of it back then.  
  
Fast forward to now, he doesn't work at my same company anymore. We exchanged a few texts but again I am the one initiating and he stops answering quite quickly, even though I don't mind and he did say that he is bad with texting. I asked him to meet for lunch and we did meet, we spent nearly four hours chatting, we hugged after an emotional moment, and overall I felt like we had a really great connection. That was nearly two months ago. I paid for the lunch and when we said goodbye, he said ""next one's on me"", but he's not really initiated anything ever since. This, paired with the fact that in the previous year I was always the one reaching out, made me wonder if maybe he was just being polite and I should read between the lines.   
  
I was starting to overthink it like a teenager, so I decided to end the loop and just text him to ask if he wanted to catch up, but adding a disclaimer saying that I wanted to be friends but I feel like I might be overstepping, that I like him but I am aware that he might not have the time, space or interest right now and I wouldn't want him to engage just to be polite, and that I'd still like him even if he said no. It was a very vulnerable text, to which he replied with scheduling suggestions, very matter-of-fact and saying he's bad at keeping convesations going but would love to stay in touch.   
But I still get the feeling that he's not really that engaged or invested and I don't want him to feel obligated to keep it up.

1icaem5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1icaem5,Exploring Different label positions,"I have gotten some feedback from a few of you about the label, and I appreciate it. The smaller text is definitely hard to read, so I have decided to try 3x2‚Äù holographic labels instead of the current 2.25x1.25‚Äù ones, which you can see in the top right corner.

Smaller labels have a cleaner, more aesthetic look, but the text is tough to read. I am debating whether to go ultra simplistic with a QR code that links to all the relevant information rather than cramming everything onto the label. The dilemma is real. I personally hate having to use my phone for every little thing, so I am leaning toward including as much information as possible directly on the packaging. From the feedback so far, roasting date and flavor notes seem to be the two most important callouts, so those will need to stand out the most.

There is also the issue of functionality. Every time you fold and forward one of these labels, it increases the chances of crinkling, which makes it look sloppy. And if you are doing this hundreds of times, it is going to require a lot of precision and consistency to avoid that.

Honestly, I am tempted to stick with the smaller label and find another way to brand the packaging, rather than using the 3x2‚Äù label. The larger labels have a lower quality look. They feel rough, cheap, and just do not hit the standard I want. Colored packaging does make it easier for the packing team to identify batches, but it lacks conformity and can feel all over the place.

I have looked into higher quality thermal, holographic, or colored labels, but the cost jumps significantly, and the finish is often flat instead of glossy, with limited color options. For now, I think I will stick with the current approach for the next batch while I work toward a better solution that balances visual appeal and functionality.

What I am really aiming for is a design aesthetic that stands out and feels memorable. That is why I asked you all to share photos of the labels in your kitchens or coffee stations. I want to see how it looks in real life. Does it grab attention? Would it make a stranger stop and take interest just from a photo? These details matter, and I want this design to truly resonate.

Once I can figure out a logo, I think the label will have more room for information so that‚Äôs also a possibility to keep footprint small by removing repeated information.",1,1738093653.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False

1icadnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1icadnw/i_feel_were_failing_our_nibling/,I feel we're failing our nibling,"My husband has a nibling, a few months younger than 2 y.o., from his brother (my BIL). BIL has a similar to common-law marriage to the baby's mother (my SIL).

I'm trying to be as neutral and as non-judgemental as possible, but SIL is unfit for a mother. She herself doesn't take care of herself and her hygiene as most people would consider normal, so I believe she doesn't see what the problem is to act the same way towards the child.

Examples are: not bathing/showering for days/weeks (even on hot/humid summer days), not washing hair for weeks, not cleaning/washing hands after touching things like the floor or the toilet and before touching food/face/mouth, not changing underwear for days (for her) / diapers for hours even while they're soiled (for baby), leaving worn underwear/diapers lying around in the house, eating/serving food that's been for days and some times even has some mold in it, wearing clothes that smell/have mold on them 'cause they've been left wet for days in the closed washer and more.

Babies don't know better and it's us adults who must teach them what they should or shouldn't do, but she doesn't stop baby when baby does anything bad, so baby doesn't learn. For example, she doesn't stop baby when baby >puts their diapers' contents in its mouth<, doesn't stop or get baby away when baby's climbing on top of tables or other furniture, doesn't stop or get baby away when baby opens cabinets/drawers in the house. Also, SIL almost never cleans house so things like >feces or blood left in the toilet/toilet seat/toilet brush< are more frequent than they should and baby has access to the bathroom unsupervised in her home (she leaves baby in home while she's outside to smoke for minutes to an hour each time) so there's that also.

Only BIL works so he's been out each day and adds as many hours as he can each time to make ends meet, while SIL, until recently, was going out daily to eat/drink coffee with friends. She spent any money that was in the bank for the baby/baby's expenses when BIL tried to keep her accountable for her spending, and she even resulted in stealing money from BIL or taking money from inlaws for baby's expenses without BIL knowning but pocketing the money instead of spending it where she claimed they were for.

We've tried talking to her multiple times, tried both soft and more tough-love discussions, we've cleaned their place multiple times with the thinking of ""teaching her how to do chores"" but each time she ends up in the same place with the chores, we've helped multiple times with money/expenses but she doesn't seem to be aware of money's value, I've even threatened her to call social services in hopes she'd start paying attention to chores and the baby, but all to no avail.

BIL had decided to take primary custody of baby and then, if she doesn't change, divorce, and we were all hoping for that 'cause we all believe that, at the moment, baby is not safe in her care when it's just the two of them alone. And they've discussed it and she was willing to give primary custody to him on her own, but turns out in our country that's not possible without lots of court's and lawyers' expenses every couple of years, even if *both* parents want to do it and agree with it. BIL doesn't have the money for it and, even though in theory SIL could still give baby to him, without a legal paper saying that she did that on her own and she wants him to have and raise baby, who's to say that she won't change her mind in the near or distant future? Who's to say, when he'll divorce her, she won't try to bring trouble to him by claiming other things like >kidnapping< or, worse, >abuse and physical threats< from him to take baby from her?

So, he either divorces and baby is raised with her while he pays for their expenses ('cause that's what our country enforces, unless mother is in prison or phychic ward) even though he doesn't have the salary to support two households, or he stays with someone like her and basically being complicit in the neglect and (I think even) abuse his baby is experiencing when baby is left alone with its mother. 

And I don't know what's worse. All I know is that our own system is not allowing us to help this baby, and the only way without spending thousands of money towards lawyers and courts is by calling child services, that most of the time don't do anything at all, and then we'll loose access to the baby since my SIL will cut contact with us afterwards.. and I feel like we're failing our nibling..",1,1738093590.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

The first part of the trip was a dream‚ÄîNashville with its neon lights and endless music, the thrill of being away from home and fully immersed in Alyssa‚Äôs energy. But Charleston‚Ä¶ Charleston was different.

Charleston wasn‚Äôt just a stop on the map. It became a turning point, though I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time.





The city had a quiet beauty to it. Pastel buildings lined cobblestone streets, and Spanish moss draped from ancient oak trees, swaying gently in the ocean breeze. It felt timeless, like we‚Äôd stepped into a different world.

We wandered aimlessly, stopping at little cafes and antique shops, soaking in the charm of the place. It was one of those rare days where everything felt perfect‚Äîlike life had slowed down just for us.

We found the chairs by accident.

Two simple wooden chairs, painted white but the paint was chipping off and slightly worn by the salty air, were tucked away on a pier between two restaurants. They faced the water, where the waves lapped gently against the shore, and the horizon stretched endlessly before us.

It was late afternoon when we sat down, the sky starting to shift into shades of orange and pink. The air was crisp but not cold, and the quiet was a welcome change from the bustling cities we‚Äôd passed through.

Alyssa leaned back, crossing her legs and tilting her head toward the horizon.

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù she said softly, her voice almost a whisper, ‚Äúfeels like one of those places.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of those places?‚Äù I asked, turning to her.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù She paused, her gaze fixed on the water. ‚ÄúThe kind of place you come back to. For closure, or peace, or‚Ä¶ something.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond right away. There was a weight in her words, something I couldn‚Äôt quite place.

We sat there in silence for a while, the only sounds the gentle lapping of the waves and the distant hum of laughter from the restaurants behind us.





And then she said it.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a pact.‚Äù

I turned to her, surprised. ‚ÄúA pact?‚Äù

She nodded, her expression thoughtful. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre forty, and we‚Äôre not married‚Ä¶‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, a small smile tugging at the corner of my lips. ‚ÄúWe meet here?‚Äù

She smiled back, but it didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes. ‚ÄúYeah. Right here. And we get married.‚Äù

It was meant to be lighthearted, almost a joke. But as I looked at her, I realized she wasn‚Äôt entirely kidding.

‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù I said quietly, extending my hand.

She hesitated for a moment before shaking it, her fingers cool against mine.

We didn‚Äôt say anything after that. We just sat there, watching the sunset paint the water in shades of gold and crimson, the unspoken weight of the moment settling over us like the evening mist.





That night, as we walked back to our hotel, Alyssa was quieter than usual.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your mind?‚Äù I asked, nudging her gently.

She glanced at me, her expression unreadable. ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said, forcing a small smile. ‚ÄúJust tired.‚Äù

But I knew her well enough to know when she wasn‚Äôt telling the truth.





Charleston stayed with me long after we left.

It wasn‚Äôt just the beauty of the city or the quiet magic of those chairs. It was what they represented‚Äîthe possibility of a future, the fear of what might happen if we didn‚Äôt make it, the silent acknowledgment that what we had was fragile, but worth fighting for.

As we drove south toward Fort Lauderdale, Alyssa dozed off in the passenger seat, her head leaning against the window. I glanced over at her, her features softened by sleep, and felt the familiar pang in my chest.

She didn‚Äôt know it yet, but Charleston had already cemented something in me.

I didn‚Äôt want to wait until forty.

I didn‚Äôt want to leave things up to fate.

I wanted her. And I was willing to do whatever it took to keep her.  
  
The next morning in Charleston, the air was crisp, the kind of weather that made you want to linger outside with a warm drink in hand. Alyssa had been unusually quiet that morning, lost in thought as we wandered through the city. But by the time we reached the little outdoor caf√© near the waterfront, her energy was back.

We found a spot on the patio, nestled at a small table with a clear view of the water. The morning sun filtered through the trees, casting dappled light over the cobblestones. It felt serene, like the whole world had slowed down just for us.

Alyssa was scrolling through her phone, looking through the photos she‚Äôd taken the day before, when her gaze shifted to a couple sitting a few tables ahead of us.

They were older, maybe in their seventies, their hands intertwined as they shared a pastry and sipped their coffee. They weren‚Äôt talking much‚Äîjust enjoying the quiet comfort of each other‚Äôs presence.

Alyssa tilted her head, watching them with a soft smile. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre cute,‚Äù she said, more to herself than to me.

Without saying another word, she pulled out her phone, adjusted the angle, and snapped a photo of them. She studied it for a moment, then got up from her seat.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I asked, amused.

She grinned at me, holding up the phone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm showing them.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh as I pulled out my own phone, switching it to video. ‚ÄúOf course you are.‚Äù





I watched her approach the couple, her steps confident but light. She bent down slightly, her voice soft and warm as she introduced herself.

‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Alyssa,‚Äù she said, holding up her phone. ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt mind, but I took this picture of you two. You just looked so sweet, and I thought you might like to have it.‚Äù

The older woman looked up at her, surprised but delighted. ‚ÄúOh, my goodness, how thoughtful of you!‚Äù

Her husband leaned in, adjusting his glasses as he squinted at the screen. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll be,‚Äù he said, smiling. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lovely picture. Thank you, dear.‚Äù

Alyssa beamed, handing them her phone so they could admire it up close. She chatted with them for a moment, asking where they were from and how long they‚Äôd been married. I couldn‚Äôt hear everything they said, but I could see the warmth in their interaction‚Äîthe way Alyssa‚Äôs face lit up as she listened, the way the couple laughed at something she said.

I hit record on my phone, capturing the whole exchange.





When she came back to the table, she handed me her phone and flopped into her chair with a satisfied grin.

‚ÄúLook at you,‚Äù I teased, showing her the video I‚Äôd taken. ‚ÄúYou claim to be heartless, but here you are, making strangers‚Äô days better just because you can.‚Äù

She rolled her eyes, but there was no denying the faint blush on her cheeks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not heartless. I‚Äôm practical.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said, leaning closer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the biggest heart of anyone I‚Äôve ever met, and you know it.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt reply, but the way her smile softened told me everything I needed to know.





As I watched her take another sip of her coffee, her hair falling loosely over her shoulders, I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought that had been lingering in the back of my mind since we sat down.

I want to be old with you.

The idea hit me with a quiet certainty, like a puzzle piece clicking into place. I could see it so clearly‚Äîyears from now, the two of us at a caf√© like this one, wrinkled and weathered but still laughing, still sharing moments that felt like little secrets meant just for us.

She caught me staring and raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said, shaking my head with a small smile.

‚ÄúLiar,‚Äù she said, narrowing her eyes playfully.

I leaned back, letting the moment linger. ‚ÄúI was just thinking how lucky I am.‚Äù

She rolled her eyes again, but this time, she reached across the table and squeezed my hand.





That day, as we walked back to the hotel, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her. The way she carried herself, the way she found joy in the little things, the way she made the world brighter without even trying.

Charleston had already left its mark on me, but that moment‚Äîwatching Alyssa show a picture to strangers just because she wanted to make them smile‚Äîthat was the moment I knew.

I didn‚Äôt just want Alyssa in my life.

I wanted her for the rest of it.  
  
**Chapter 11: The First Goodbye**  
  
The text came through, and my chest tightened before I even opened it.

**Alyssa:** *Hey, I‚Äôve been thinking about us, and I need to talk to you.*

I stared at the words, the screen lighting up my dimly lit room. I didn‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions, but something about the phrasing‚Äîso careful, so deliberate‚Äîmade my stomach twist.

I thought of Winters then, the way I always did when things felt like they were falling apart. He had this unshakable way of looking at problems, like no matter how bad it got, he‚Äôd just bulldoze through it. He‚Äôd make some dark joke to cut through the tension, push forward, and shrug off the pain like it didn‚Äôt matter.

But Winters wasn‚Äôt here.

I didn‚Äôt have him to console me, to give me perspective. I was alone in this, trying to navigate a world that felt like it was crumbling beneath me.





When I arrived at her apartment later that night, the air between us was different‚Äîheavier, charged with unspoken words.

She let me in, her expression tight, and I followed her to the couch. She sat down, hands clasped in her lap, and I stayed standing, my arms crossed, bracing myself for whatever was coming.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to say this,‚Äù she began, her voice steady but painfully quiet. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think I can do this anymore.‚Äù

I stood there, frozen, her words echoing in my head.

‚ÄúI thought I could,‚Äù she continued, her eyes fixed on her hands. ‚ÄúI really wanted to. But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I can give you what you deserve.‚Äù

I felt like the air had been knocked out of me. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think you can, or you don‚Äôt want to?‚Äù

She flinched at the question, her shoulders tensing. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.

I clenched my jaw, trying to rein in the frustration bubbling beneath the surface. ‚ÄúI thought we were building something,‚Äù I said, my voice sharper than I intended. ‚ÄúI thought this was real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù she said quickly, looking up at me with tears brimming in her eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs me, Jacob. I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know how to do this. I don‚Äôt know how to let someone in like this.‚Äù

Her vulnerability stopped me in my tracks.

Alyssa‚Äîthe confident, independent, fiercely guarded Alyssa‚Äîwas breaking in front of me, and I didn‚Äôt know how to put her back together.





For a long time, we just sat in silence.

I thought of Winters again, of the advice he might‚Äôve given me. He would‚Äôve told me to man up, to face it head-on. But he wasn‚Äôt here, and all I could do was sit there, my hands trembling as I tried to find the right words.

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs how you feel,‚Äù I said finally, my voice quiet but steady, ‚Äúthen I get it. But you need to know something.‚Äù

She looked up at me, her eyes wide and searching.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to hurt you,‚Äù I said, taking a step closer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to leave. I‚Äôm here because I want you. All of you. Even the parts that scare you.‚Äù

Her tears spilled over then, and she broke.

The sound of her crying hit me like a punch to the chest. It wasn‚Äôt just tears‚Äîit was raw, unfiltered, gut-wrenching sobs that seemed to shake her whole body.

I crossed the room in an instant, kneeling in front of her and pulling her into my arms.

She clung to me like I was the only thing keeping her grounded, her fingers digging into my back as her tears soaked through my shirt.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine my life without you,‚Äù she whispered, her voice breaking.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù I said, my own voice trembling.





For a moment, I thought we might be okay. But then she pulled back, her expression conflicted.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs enough,‚Äù she said softly.

Her words hung in the air like a weight, pressing down on my chest.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say.





When I finally stood to leave, she walked me to the door, the silence between us heavy with everything we weren‚Äôt saying.

At the threshold, she hesitated, her hand resting lightly on the edge of the door.

‚ÄúJacob‚Ä¶‚Äù

I turned back, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

She looked at me, her eyes filled with something I couldn‚Äôt quite place. ‚ÄúTake care of yourself, okay?‚Äù

I nodded, swallowing hard. ‚ÄúYou too.‚Äù

And then I walked away.





I didn‚Äôt go home right away. Instead, I sat in my car outside her apartment, my hands gripping the steering wheel as I tried to make sense of everything.

I thought of Winters again‚Äîof the road, of the gunfire, of his voice echoing in my head. ‚ÄúOchs, you‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

But this wasn‚Äôt a battlefield. This wasn‚Äôt something I could power through with brute force or stubbornness.

This was her.

And for the first time since I‚Äôd met her, I felt like I was losing her.

I didn‚Äôt know how to stop it.  
  
**Chapter 12: Across the World**

The silence between us after the road trip wasn‚Äôt permanent. It never could be. Alyssa and I were like magnets‚Äîno matter how much space we tried to put between us, we always found our way back together.

And as much as she‚Äôd stayed ‚ÄúMiss Alyssa‚Äù when we first met, that started to change. Slowly but surely, she became Alyssa Sue. Then Pretty Girl. Crazy Girl. Sweetheart.

Sometimes, without thinking, I‚Äôd call her ‚Äúbabe‚Äù or ‚Äúbaby.‚Äù It would just slip out, the words so natural they felt inevitable. She‚Äôd roll her eyes and smirk, pretending not to like it, but I could tell she didn‚Äôt mind. She never corrected me.

We had our routine‚Äîlate-night texts, inside jokes, and an easy rhythm that made the rest of the world fade away when we were together. But somehow, being in the same city wasn‚Äôt enough. The spark between us demanded more, and before I knew it, we were boarding a plane bound for the other side of the world.





China felt like stepping into a different universe.

The cities were massive, sprawling metropolises where everything moved faster than I thought possible. Neon lights lit up the night sky, reflecting off glass skyscrapers that seemed to touch the clouds. The streets were alive with people, their voices blending into a hum that was both chaotic and oddly soothing.

It was overwhelming, but Alyssa thrived in it. She had this way of adapting to new places like she‚Äôd lived there her whole life. While I was still figuring out how to navigate the language barrier and unfamiliar streets, she was already diving headfirst into the experience.

We spent our days wandering markets and sampling street food, Alyssa‚Äôs curiosity leading us down alleys I never would‚Äôve dared to explore alone. She took pictures of everything‚Äîshopkeepers arranging colorful displays, children playing in narrow streets, the way the light hit the lanterns strung above us at dusk.

‚ÄúThis place is magic,‚Äù she said one evening as we stood on a bridge overlooking a river, the water shimmering with the reflections of city lights.

I nodded, my gaze fixed on her rather than the view. ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù





It felt too good to be true.

Every moment with her was like something out of a dream. We laughed until our sides hurt, shared meals that felt like tiny adventures, and fell asleep tangled in sheets that smelled faintly of jasmine and the city air.





Looking back, I think China was the tipping point.

It was the first time we‚Äôd been so completely immersed in each other‚Äôs lives, with no distractions, no escape routes. We were together, all the time, in a place where we only had each other.

It brought out the best in us‚Äîher curiosity, my steadiness, the way we balanced each other. But it also brought out the things we weren‚Äôt ready to face yet.

Things like trust.

Things like fear.





We didn‚Äôt know it then, but the cracks that had started to show in China were just the beginning.

And soon, they would grow into something we couldn‚Äôt ignore.

‚ÄúLook at you,‚Äù I teased, showing her the video I‚Äôd taken. ‚ÄúYou claim to be heartless, but here you are, making strangers‚Äô days better just because you can.‚Äù

She rolled her eyes, but there was no denying the faint blush on her cheeks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not heartless. I‚Äôm practical.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said, leaning closer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the biggest heart of anyone I‚Äôve ever met, and you know it.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt reply, but the way her smile softened told me everything I needed to know.





As I watched her take another sip of her coffee, her hair falling loosely over her shoulders, I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought that had been lingering in the back of my mind since we sat down.

I want to be old with you.

The idea hit me with a quiet certainty, like a puzzle piece clicking into place. I could see it so clearly‚Äîyears from now, the two of us at a caf√© like this one, wrinkled and weathered but still laughing, still sharing moments that felt like little secrets meant just for us.

She caught me staring and raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said, shaking my head with a small smile.

‚ÄúLiar,‚Äù she said, narrowing her eyes playfully.

I leaned back, letting the moment linger. ‚ÄúI was just thinking how lucky I am.‚Äù

She rolled her eyes again, but this time, she reached across the table and squeezed my hand.





That day, as we walked back to the hotel, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her. The way she carried herself, the way she found joy in the little things, the way she made the world brighter without even trying.

Charleston had already left its mark on me, but that moment‚Äîwatching Alyssa show a picture to strangers just because she wanted to make them smile‚Äîthat was the moment I knew.

I didn‚Äôt just want Alyssa in my life.

I wanted her for the rest of it.  
  
**Chapter 11: The First Goodbye**  
  
The text came through, and my chest tightened before I even opened it.

**Alyssa:** *Hey, I‚Äôve been thinking about us, and I need to talk to you.*

I stared at the words, the screen lighting up my dimly lit room. I didn‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions, but something about the phrasing‚Äîso careful, so deliberate‚Äîmade my stomach twist.

I thought of Winters then, the way I always did when things felt like they were falling apart. He had this unshakable way of looking at problems, like no matter how bad it got, he‚Äôd just bulldoze through it. He‚Äôd make some dark joke to cut through the tension, push forward, and shrug off the pain like it didn‚Äôt matter.

But Winters wasn‚Äôt here.

I didn‚Äôt have him to console me, to give me perspective. I was alone in this, trying to navigate a world that felt like it was crumbling beneath me.





When I arrived at her apartment later that night, the air between us was different‚Äîheavier, charged with unspoken words.

She let me in, her expression tight, and I followed her to the couch. She sat down, hands clasped in her lap, and I stayed standing, my arms crossed, bracing myself for whatever was coming.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to say this,‚Äù she began, her voice steady but painfully quiet. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think I can do this anymore.‚Äù

I stood there, frozen, her words echoing in my head.

‚ÄúI thought I could,‚Äù she continued, her eyes fixed on her hands. ‚ÄúI really wanted to. But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I can give you what you deserve.‚Äù

I felt like the air had been knocked out of me. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think you can, or you don‚Äôt want to?‚Äù

She flinched at the question, her shoulders tensing. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.

I clenched my jaw, trying to rein in the frustration bubbling beneath the surface. ‚ÄúI thought we were building something,‚Äù I said, my voice sharper than I intended. ‚ÄúI thought this was real.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù she said quickly, looking up at me with tears brimming in her eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs me, Jacob. I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know how to do this. I don‚Äôt know how to let someone in like this.‚Äù

Her vulnerability stopped me in my tracks.

Alyssa‚Äîthe confident, independent, fiercely guarded Alyssa‚Äîwas breaking in front of me, and I didn‚Äôt know how to put her back together.





For a long time, we just sat in silence.

I thought of Winters again, of the advice he might‚Äôve given me. He would‚Äôve told me to man up, to face it head-on. But he wasn‚Äôt here, and all I could do was sit there, my hands trembling as I tried to find the right words.

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs how you feel,‚Äù I said finally, my voice quiet but steady, ‚Äúthen I get it. But you need to know something.‚Äù

She looked up at me, her eyes wide and searching.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to hurt you,‚Äù I said, taking a step closer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to leave. I‚Äôm here because I want you. All of you. Even the parts that scare you.‚Äù

Her tears spilled over then, and she broke.

The sound of her crying hit me like a punch to the chest. It wasn‚Äôt just tears‚Äîit was raw, unfiltered, gut-wrenching sobs that seemed to shake her whole body.

I crossed the room in an instant, kneeling in front of her and pulling her into my arms.

She clung to me like I was the only thing keeping her grounded, her fingers digging into my back as her tears soaked through my shirt.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine my life without you,‚Äù she whispered, her voice breaking.

‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù I said, my own voice trembling.





For a moment, I thought we might be okay. But then she pulled back, her expression conflicted.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs enough,‚Äù she said softly.

Her words hung in the air like a weight, pressing down on my chest.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say.





When I finally stood to leave, she walked me to the door, the silence between us heavy with everything we weren‚Äôt saying.

At the threshold, she hesitated, her hand resting lightly on the edge of the door.

‚ÄúJacob‚Ä¶‚Äù

I turned back, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

She looked at me, her eyes filled with something I couldn‚Äôt quite place. ‚ÄúTake care of yourself, okay?‚Äù

I nodded, swallowing hard. ‚ÄúYou too.‚Äù

And then I walked away.





I didn‚Äôt go home right away. Instead, I sat in my car outside her apartment, my hands gripping the steering wheel as I tried to make sense of everything.

I thought of Winters again‚Äîof the road, of the gunfire, of his voice echoing in my head. ‚ÄúOchs, you‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

But this wasn‚Äôt a battlefield. This wasn‚Äôt something I could power through with brute force or stubbornness.

This was her.

And for the first time since I‚Äôd met her, I felt like I was losing her.

I didn‚Äôt know how to stop it.  
  
**Chapter 12: Across the World**

The silence between us after the road trip wasn‚Äôt permanent. It never could be. Alyssa and I were like magnets‚Äîno matter how much space we tried to put between us, we always found our way back together.

And as much as she‚Äôd stayed ‚ÄúMiss Alyssa‚Äù when we first met, that started to change. Slowly but surely, she became Alyssa Sue. Then Pretty Girl. Crazy Girl. Sweetheart.

Sometimes, without thinking, I‚Äôd call her ‚Äúbabe‚Äù or ‚Äúbaby.‚Äù It would just slip out, the words so natural they felt inevitable. She‚Äôd roll her eyes and smirk, pretending not to like it, but I could tell she didn‚Äôt mind. She never corrected me.

We had our routine‚Äîlate-night texts, inside jokes, and an easy rhythm that made the rest of the world fade away when we were together. But somehow, being in the same city wasn‚Äôt enough. The spark between us demanded more, and before I knew it, we were boarding a plane bound for the other side of the world.





China felt like stepping into a different universe.

The cities were massive, sprawling metropolises where everything moved faster than I thought possible. Neon lights lit up the night sky, reflecting off glass skyscrapers that seemed to touch the clouds. The streets were alive with people, their voices blending into a hum that was both chaotic and oddly soothing.

It was overwhelming, but Alyssa thrived in it. She had this way of adapting to new places like she‚Äôd lived there her whole life. While I was still figuring out how to navigate the language barrier and unfamiliar streets, she was already diving headfirst into the experience.

We spent our days wandering markets and sampling street food, Alyssa‚Äôs curiosity leading us down alleys I never would‚Äôve dared to explore alone. She took pictures of everything‚Äîshopkeepers arranging colorful displays, children playing in narrow streets, the way the light hit the lanterns strung above us at dusk.

‚ÄúThis place is magic,‚Äù she said one evening as we stood on a bridge overlooking a river, the water shimmering with the reflections of city lights.

I nodded, my gaze fixed on her rather than the view. ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù





It felt too good to be true.

Every moment with her was like something out of a dream. We laughed until our sides hurt, shared meals that felt like tiny adventures, and fell asleep tangled in sheets that smelled faintly of jasmine and the city air.





Looking back, I think China was the tipping point.

It was the first time we‚Äôd been so completely immersed in each other‚Äôs lives, with no distractions, no escape routes. We were together, all the time, in a place where we only had each other.

It brought out the best in us‚Äîher curiosity, my steadiness, the way we balanced each other. But it also brought out the things we weren‚Äôt ready to face yet.

Things like trust.

Things like fear.

We didn‚Äôt know it then, but the cracks that had started to show in China were just the beginning.",1,1738093415.0,love,2,1.0,False

However, my parents have behaved poorly in more ways than one.

My dad and mom are separated and have been for a long time. They remain together for financial reasons and honestly because my dad still loves her but they‚Äôre toxic and spent most of their relationship not getting along. 

I went to Italy with my mom, my aunt and cousin when I was 10 weeks pregnant and my mom constantly picked fights with me. We shared a room one night when she spoke loudly on the phone with my dad waking me up. Since I was newly pregnant I was worried about my sleep and wanted to make sure I was getting enough. She clearly did not care. On one occasion when we were headed to a different part of Italy, she sat on the train not speaking to the group and cried. She had told me to stand up straight when I carrying luggage and I just said don‚Äôt worry about it. That made her cry. 

My MIL and my aunt had thrown me a baby shower when my mom told my aunt I forbade her to throw me one. That wasn‚Äôt true, my mom had thrown me a bridal shower and I didn‚Äôt want to have her go through the trouble again, but I never forbade her. 

On my baby shower day, she came over with her puppy that‚Äôs poorly trained and not potty trained well yet. Right when she came in with him, he peed on the floor. When I told her he peed she acted like she didn‚Äôt know what to do and so I told her to go outside and make sure he doesn‚Äôt have to go any more. I started cleaning it up when my SIL came over to help me since I was 34 weeks pregnant at the time. She came in and grabbed a sucker I had sitting out and instead of offering to help me get ready for the baby shower and get her dog crate set up, she stood around looking for direction. When I said maybe you set up the dog crate, she said she didn‚Äôt know how. It didn‚Äôt ruin the day because we had guys that could help but the helpless attitude is too much.

Fast forward to the most recent event, my mom and dad were supposed to come help me put my nursery together with my husband and I. My in laws have done so much from making sure we have everything we need to repairing the ceiling and arranging someone to wallpaper the room. My dad went to my mom‚Äôs, took her puppy on a walk in the front and backyard and played with him.  When they came inside, the puppy went to jump to sit next to my dad and my dad hit/pushed him to where he hit the coffee table and fell on his side. My mom screamed because it was aggressive and unnecessary. She then said she wouldn‚Äôt be coming with my dad this weekend to help us. When I talked to my dad about it, he said he didn‚Äôt want to the dog jumping on him and it‚Äôs not his fault where the dog landed. I don‚Äôt agree. It‚Äôs a puppy and you need to build good behaviors which requires redirection not trauma. I said well we have a dog so if that‚Äôs an issue you don‚Äôt need to come. He said idk why people have dogs that jump all over and invite people over. I said well you can‚Äôt control the dog all of the time and people who come over typically understand that. He then went on and on trying to defend his actions when I said no, that is not ok. It‚Äôs a puppy and an innocent animal. My dad doesn‚Äôt like dogs which makes him think they should not be around when he‚Äôs around. He threatened to leave at Christmas because there were dogs and had gently kicked my mom‚Äôs puppy when he bit his coat.

These situations combined make me want to limit my time with them. My mom offered to help me when the baby arrives, but when she acts to helpless with a puppy I fear it will stress me out and frustrate me if she behaves the same with my baby. Clearly she‚Äôs raised me and also my siblings but the helplessness drives me crazy. My dad has bought us a crib and dresser, which I‚Äôm so thankful for but again, his intolerance of dogs and abusive behavior makes me not want to have him around when the baby gets here either. I will not be able to handle if he treats my dog poorly.

(Tagged relationships, but it's not about romance, it's about a friendship!)

Hey all! Last night I couldn't sleep yet again because I 
was ruminating about a friend. This has been going off and on for almost a year now (which feels so absurd to say) and I've grown absolutely tired from it. I'm looking for advice, but also a place to vent perhaps. I'm afraid this is gonna be long because that always seems the case when I turn to reddit for advice. English is not my main language, sorry for any mistakes! TL;DR at the bottom.

I (F33) met Fran (F28) about four years ago at work, where she started as an intern. We hit it off quickly, it was nice to have a workfriend as the work environment was pretty toxic, lots of gossiping etc. (I left after a year and she quit her internship around the same time). We became very close friends very quickly. During that time, I also got back together with my ex, Tom. The breakup that happened 2,5 years before that was absolutely horrible, it blindsided me completely and things were really complicated and messy. Long story short: we both had gone through a lot of personal growth, we both wanted to give it another try and 1,5 years later we broke it off again, this time as a mutual agreement. 

When I met my ex for the first time I became part of his friend group. During all the trials and tribulations of our relationships and breakups, I remained friends with almost everyone and some of them I even consider my best friends. Fran also met these people, as I love to host parties and bring people together. Fran had a big crush on Tom's best friend Mark and he had a crush on her. But Fran was in a relationship so nothing happened (in the beginning).

During my friendship with Fran, there have been multiple occasions where I felt uncomfortable due to things she did or said. She can be quite direct (which is also admire in some situations) but also in very angry and harsh way. I'm high sensitive and don't like conflicts, this energy can absolutely drain me. Some examples are her defending cheating (my ex cheated on me and I was processing that), her and her then boyfriend absolutely roasting my new partner, her being rude to waiters at a restaurant, pushing advice about all sorts of things.

When Tom and I broke up, she was very supportive. She helped me so much during that time, even though the breakup itself wasn't that hard, the bigger picture (two longeterm relationships, two breakups, a lot of shitty things in between) was a lot to process. I could always vent to her, let my heart out and she would always be there for me. She was very opinionated about Tom, hateful even, which honestly was nice every now and then.

A year later, she cheated twice with Mark (Tom's best friend) and broke up with her partner. I was there for her, even though I really didn't like her actions. I think that's where I started to take little steps back in our friendship. She and Mark started dating and became official after a few months. 
During this time, I tried to work on myself, got therapy and tried to focus on me and things that give me joy. I concluded that while I forgive my ex for everything and accept and understand how everything went the way it went, the less I have him in my life, the more peace and quiet I have. I feel pain and sadness very deeply and while I do forgive, I never really forget. (He cheated, gaslighted, and made me feel worthless and undesirable to the core).

When she and Mark got together, I knew there was a possibility that she and Tom would become friends. He's very funny and charismatic and of course it's nice when you're friends with your partner's friends! She would always assure me that that would never happen though; she absolutely hated Tom, didn't like him as a person even apart from my history with him. To be clear, I never asked her not to be friends, she just made these statements herself.

I think I knew from the beginning though that a friendship would flourish. One time she texted me that she took drugs with Mark, Tom and his new girlfriend (shrooms and ketamine I think) and she stayed over at his place, ""but she still didn't like him!"". 

In January (last year) I went solo traveling for a couple of months. Honestly it was so nice to be in a different environment and to really focus on myself. The communication has gotten less already during the months prior to that and it became even less while I was traveling (there was also a time difference of 8 hours). Fran got into a burnout, so I gave her a call. She told me she went for a walk with Tom and his girlfriend and really enjoyed it and liked hanging out with them. I think something snapped in me during that conversation. It was just so weird, how she casually mentioned it, as we never had conversations about this potential friendship before, as if she never had said anything negative about him. Even though I saw the friendship coming, I think I was flabbergasted with the way she shared this development with me. It gave me a lot of stress and I went into this avoiding mode. I wanted to enjoy my trip, so I decided to pull back and have an honest talk with her once I was back.

When I got back two months later, I saw her in a group setting and she expressed her disappointment in people not reaching out to her. I felt quite guilty and knew that I had to tell her why I didn't reach out as much while I was gone traveling. A few days later we had a coffee date and I explained to her that I felt sorry I wasn't there for her during the start of her burnout, but that I really struggled with the news of her becoming friends with my ex and his girlfriend, that I needed space and that I had the feeling that that need for space might be longterm. While I understood how the friendship developed and was genuinely happy for her and Mark to share this friendship, I'm actively trying to not have my ex in my life. This situation was just too weird for me. It was also hurtful in a way, but in a bittersweet way I guess. I absolutely never blamed her or anything and I made that very clear. She reacted very upset and stressed and I ended up consoling her, while in hindsight, I really needed some understanding from her.

Our friendship got really tense after that. There were moments where it felt like we were rebuilding, but something would happen and I would feel drained again. The friendship wasn't giving me energy anymore. It really collapsed for me when she gave me a call in the evening on Sunday right before I went to bed, to inform me that Tom and his girlfriend would get engaged in four months. She thought I would like to hear it from a friend rather than seeing it on social media (I don't follow either of them). She also asked if my roommate was with me, to comfort me I guess, before giving me the news. I was absolutely flabbergasted during the phone call and afterwards I realized she overstepped a boundary. What the hell am I supposed to do with this news? What good does it bring me to know about their engagement, let alone four months prior to it even happening? (It stil hasn't happened btw and it's 5 months later now..)

So, even though I'm hella conflict avoidant, I told her that, while I know it came from a good heart, I really didn't appreciate her telling me this. That I know it wasn't her intention, but it felt a little belittling that someone should be there to comfort me. But also, I am actively trying to live my life without my ex, which is already a challenge sometimes, and this felt like she pushed him in my face. She reacted very upset. She was angry and thought it was unfair that I set this boundary. She was really hurt by it and she felt like it came out or nothing.

Since then I realized I'm done with this friendship. It's draining, stressful and there's just no joy in it for me anymore. It's bittersweet because we used to be good friends, but my God, she has been one of the biggest anxiety factors in my life for the past year and that feels ridiculous. So it feels like cutting her off is the best solution. Problem is I can't fully do that, because she's part of my friend group as well now. I will see her at birthdays, during Christmas with friends, casual get togethers. We even have a boardgame date this Sunday which has been scheduled for months (which is the cause for me ruminating again). There is just so much tension. It feels like she mad, disappointed and hurt about me pulling back from the friendship. It low-key pisses me off, because I've been understanding to her from the start. 

I know being the bigger person would the solution here. But I'm just so tired from all of this. I don't want to spend anymore time and energy on this. But I know we both feel like shit, I know I do. Everytime we tried to discuss it, we end up with more tension. I hope seeing each other in friendly settings with other friends will help ease the tension. 

I journal, talk with friends, focus on things that make me happy. Yet when I'm in bed, this situation can keep me up for hours. I just keep thinking the same things (basically what I've written here). I don't know what else to do and I find it exhausting and out of proportion that it's always on my mind.

If you made it this far, thank you. My apologies for the text wall. Have a good day and thanks for letting me vent! X

TL;DR: a former close friend became friends with my ex and his new girlfriend. I don't want these people in my life as it brings me nothing positive. She's upset about me pulling back from the friendship and doesn't understand me. There is so much tension between us and it causes me a lot of anxiety and restless nights.

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.

Also, I do care about physical attraction so here is my photos.

During our second date, we hooked up. I realized we never talked about what we were looking for beforehand (although my mutual friends definitely knew I've been looking for something serious). He didn't text me after 24 hours so I sent him a message ""I had fun yesterday! I'm looking for something serious - are you too? If so, see you on Friday! If not, it was so nice to meet you."" He replied that he was looking for something serious but he didn't think we had the chemistry he was looking for and that he would like to be friends/get dinner on Friday. I suggested we get coffee instead. After getting coffee, we continued to text and it was very clear he was looking to hookup. We did hook up two more times, but I realized I was starting to get attached, so I knew the right thing was to cut it off. I sent him a nice message ""It was really nice getting to know you, but I need to only focus on something serious right now, so I think it's better if we limit our interactions moving forward. I hope you find what you're looking for!"" He asked remain friends, but I told him I'd rather not because I would hope that a future partner isn't friends with exes/past hookups, so I wouldn't be either. He flipped out and started texting me degrading/condescending things.

TL;DR! I'm confused by his reaction and why he was hurt. If anything, I should have felt hurt and lashed out that he didn't want anything serious with me?",0,1738093093.0,relationships,7,0.5,False

1ica4wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ica4wi/being_harassed_at_work/,Being harassed at work,"For context, I‚Äôve been working at a corporate starbucks for over 2 years. I used to work 5 days a week, but since starting college I can only work 3 days a week/ I‚Äôm also mainly a closer. 

So there was this regular who I would always chat with just abt our hobbies and interests. Btw I‚Äôm 20F and hes probably in his late 50s/early 60s (literally my dad‚Äôs age). 

So one day in early December, he comes in and we chat a little bit, and then he asked for my email. At first I was confused and asked ‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúOh Im just wondering‚Äù. I always like to assume positive intent so I was thinking maybe it‚Äôs not that weird, at least he didn‚Äôt ask for my number. So I stupidly gave it to him (DONT EVER DO THIS EVEN IF U CANT SAY NO cus im that type of person now ive learned). Immediately after saying it to him I regret it, but I was hoping it would just be some hiking trails bc we had talked abt that stuff. 

So later that night, I get a long email from him, basically saying that he‚Äôs happy to be able to talk to me without having to get a coffee and that he feels like we‚Äôre becoming friends. I got a weird vibe from it so I didn‚Äôt respond. Fast forward two days later, he sends another email that I don‚Äôt respond to. Later that same day, HE FOUND MY NUMBER AND TEXTED ME. None of my coworkers would EVER give out my number as we had another coworker go through something similar. 

At this point, it‚Äôs getting very weird and I‚Äôm getting scared. I told my coworkers about it in our group chat and one of my supervisors made an incident report. He continues to email me, and I didn‚Äôt respond because I felt like he thats what he wanted from me, so I just ignored them. I blocked him but his emails would still come through my spam folder so I read them. He admitted to having a crush on me, say ‚ÄúI miss you my friend‚Äùa lot and would go on tangents about his life. 

There was one Friday night I was closing, he came as I was walking to the back of the store to use the bathroom and I guess he saw me. My coworker texted me to not come out. An hour later, HE CAME BACK with his son, and as soon as I saw his son I immediately walked to the back to avoid him. He emailed me that night that he would leave me alone and not come back. But he didn‚Äôt. He continued to email me and come into the store, but I avoided him at all costs. 

I have told my manager about this situation, and showed her all the emails and text message he sent me. All she said was there‚Äôs nothing Starbucks can do and to get a restraining order. To me it seems like she doesn‚Äôt care. 

The last email he sent me was on January 10th, basically admitting to using a background check app to verify my email and find my phone number. He probably has my address too but I cant be sure. Even though he hasn‚Äôt emailed me in almost 3 weeks, without fail he‚Äôs been coming in every Friday night. Idk how he knows but he knows I close Fridays. 

This past Friday, he mobile ordered and came again. I hid from him like I always do, but I‚Äôm getting tired of it and I feel unsafe at work. I texted my manager this and she called me to just go to the police and get a restraining order. I want a restraining order to be a last resort/ I also don‚Äôt know if theres sufficient evidence against him to file one. I asked her if I can be switched to morning/mid on Fridays and she said she doesn‚Äôt know if its possible because no one can close on Fridays.

I sent in a new availability and I texted her. She said that she will come in on Friday to talk to me about it. Should I just transfer stores if she can‚Äôt accommodate me? I feel bad bc my availability is pretty limited atm because of school, but I also value my safety more. It feels unfair that other partners can only work morning/ mid but I can‚Äôt one day of the week (I close all 3 days of the week I work). I feel stuck on what to do. Pls help!

(Law Student),"Hi everyone, just coming here to share some light! I got the call yesterday that I‚Äôve been awarded a prestigious legal fellowship in San Francisco. Although I‚Äôm nervous about moving across the country, I‚Äôm incredibly excited about this opportunity.

Getting floxed during law school was not how I envisioned the end of my educational journey, but it happened. I went through the tears, the pain, and the mental blockades, but I managed to rise above it all. I am unbelievably proud of myself. This morning, I cried thinking about all the hard work that led to this moment and all the pain and suffering being floxed caused me ‚Äîbut some light is finally here.

I‚Äôm still not 100% recovered. The main thing holding me back now is my gym performance‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt been able to jog yet. However, I couldn‚Äôt walk long distances before, and now I‚Äôm speed-walking 2 miles 3x a week! I hope that in a month or two, I‚Äôll reach my previous energy levels, but I‚Äôm not in a rush. I‚Äôve been able to lift weights, I‚Äôve gotten really into yoga (it‚Äôs my favorite hobby right now), and I‚Äôve even been drinking coffee without getting flared up.

Also, I know I‚Äôm 26 (getting older!), but I feel so much more mature than I was before all this. Before floxing, I was quick to binge drink, go out with friends, smoke, skip readings, and live without a clear vision. Now, I feel more centered and focused. Like my mentor said, this was life aligning me with my purpose, and I truly believe that.

Ultimately, this experience is going to make me a better advocate for my clients. It sucked that this happened, and I‚Äôm not 100% back yet, but I cant live without finding the silver lining.

Other people are obsessed with astrology, and/or believe everything in the universe is planned/has a purpose. So they talk a lot about how that applies to their lives, and of course they expect me to understand and connect to what they say with the same enthusiasm as theirs.

Holly stares slack-jawed toward the shoreline, kneading the beach towel between her fingers in nervous anticipation. We are all frozen in place, witnessing the ascension from the waves. No one dares utter a word. Fear paints all of our faces a deep crimson.

At first, it seemed like buoys were surfacing, tethered in rows, stretching along the width of the bay. Once his face broke through the surface, astonishment replaced our fear. Bespeckled and with firm features, his dark-grey pork-pie hat masked the extent of his greying hair. He glided toward the shore in strides displaying a mechanical briskness. The remaining droplets of water fell from the rim of his hat, disappearing back into the ocean. His entire suit remained unsullied; any attempts by the water to cling to his being were firmly rejected by some omnipotent force emanating from his body. In his right hand hung a briefcase, jet black with a golden rim.

He reached the shore around fifty feet to the left of us. The sunlight reflected off the polish on his Chelsea boots. His entire suit was immaculately tailored and pristine, yet unmistakably wrong. It looked stiff and old-fashioned, as if marching out of a time thoroughly alien to us. The sand refused to cling to his shoes. He may have noticed us, but he didn‚Äôt break his gaze. The only slowing of his pace was to turn to the stairs, which led him off the beach and onto the embankment.

Our attention was then stolen by the sudden crashing of water. Five, ten, two dozen, four dozen‚Äîcountless men, all of similar stature, identically and immaculately dressed, began rising from the water, marching in military formation toward us. Each with the same round-rimmed spectacles. Each with the same black and gold briefcase. Each unwavering in their parade toward the shoreline.

We fucking shit ourselves.

Scrambling to our feet, we launch ourselves at the embankment and begin to climb. James is the most agile and reaches the railings first, diving through the bars and sprinting off up the path without a second thought to the rest of us. We scramble frantically at the cold concrete, grazing knees and palms as we make our way over the top. As I reach the path, launching to my feet, I turn to observe the performance unfolding on shore. Countless rows of businessmen are marching towards the embankment. In turn, they file up the stairs with rhythmic cadence in their footsteps.

Without further hesitation, I bolt up the embankment towards town, encountering no obstacles in my frenzy. I remember the first man. Wonder if we‚Äôll catch up to him, or if he‚Äôll ambush us. I don‚Äôt give two shits if I see that bespeckled fuck, I‚Äôll deck him. I round the corner and onto the main road. We scatter in different directions as I make my own way to sanctuary. 

Town lies in the same slumber of which I have known my entire life. Lined with staples of high-street malaise ‚Äì butchers, building societies, and takeaways. The streets lie dormant of their previous high-churning economy. Every other shop is smashed, boarded up, open to let, stripped of their community promise. I pay it no mind; They have all become pieces of home whose familiarity still warms me. I recognise faces dotting the high-street, drawing attention to the emptiness that surrounds them. Creaky, a vagrant with whom I have shared many a chat and a coffee, lies sleeping beneath his sheets outside the local news and booze.

I dart towards ‚ÄòGrimsthorpe Best Fish‚Äô. An immaculate, if kitsch, little fishmongers to the centre right of the high-street. Inside I find my mother hunched behind the cash register, lording over fine cuts of salmon, haddock, and trout, resting in well-tempered display. I rush behind the counter to her side, wide eyed and mouth agape, struggling to muster a sound. She stares inquisitively and asks what‚Äôs wrong. Before I even begin to collect my thoughts, we are interrupted by a soft wrapping at the window.

‚ÄúExcuse me, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù His voice is muffled through the glass. My mother steps politely towards the window, breaking my concentration.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre open, you can come in.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I apologise, but I didn‚Äôt want to intrude.‚Äù He glances down at me beneath his spectacles. Only now do I get a sense of his height. Tall and domineering. Distance hid no imperfections except the age around his eyes. Once the shoreline, now the glass; our final barrier between us is broken as he glides through the doorway and into my mother‚Äôs shop. He eyes me with a look of recognition.

‚ÄúAs your boy is probably quite aware, I‚Äôm from out of town.‚Äù I startle at the acknowledgement of myself and circumstances of his arrival. His gentle smile dismisses my apprehension.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd hate to burden you; I stopped by your shop because I was wondering if it was for sale possibly?‚Äù

My mom guffaws involuntarily at the request.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm afraid not‚Äù, she laughs.

His nose wrinkles in confusion as he pushes his spectacles back up his face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for sale, love, you‚Äôll have to try somewhere else then.‚Äù My mother firmly rebukes and turns on her heels.

‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm fully serious. I would like to buy your property, I‚Äôd be more than happy to pay a reasonable sum for the purchase and transfer of rights, for your shop, *today*.‚Äù The firmness of his tone elevates the seriousness of his proposition. She scans him up and down with piercing judgement. Disgust rises from her stomach at the thought of diminishing our livelihoods to a single request.

‚ÄúAnd who the fuck are you then?‚Äù She spits with righteous indignation.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just an inquirer.‚Äù He stammers ‚ÄúI-I feel I would have a lot to offer if you would kindly let me explain for a moment.‚Äù My mother‚Äôs mind is set, but her interest still piqued.

He persists ‚ÄúI have in my possession, a considerable sum of money, which I‚Äôm sure will satisfy both yourself and your stakeholders.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you want with my shop.‚Äù She retorts abruptly.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an investment, I‚Äôm here under strict instructions to purchase a retail property in a prime commercial location. It‚Äôs not my money ‚Äì I‚Äôm not too concerned to be parting with it quite frankly.‚Äù He smiles weakly and lets out a hollow chuckle.

‚ÄúHow much are you offering?‚Äù She blankly responds. I shoot my mother a look of concern as her mood shifts from hostility to curiosity.

‚ÄúHow much do you want?‚Äù

My mother pauses for a moment, eyeing the surroundings before reaching a figure.

‚Äú¬£150,000‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you ¬£170,000‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck off, you‚Äôre not much of a fucking businessman, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not haggling, ma‚Äôam‚Äù He reassures. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to buy your retail property at reasonable compensation to yourself, and for the property and rights to be transferred, to my enterprise, today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat will you do with it?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything I like.‚Äù 

The obtuseness of his response startles her into recognising the absurdity of the situation.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre giving me ¬£170,000 for my shop, right now. Where is it? Is it in that briefcase?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Äù

‚ÄúShow me.‚Äù

He leads my mother over to the shop counter and places the briefcase beside the till. Releasing the clasps, the briefcase springs open revealing ¬£50 notes, bound together in neat stacks, each labelled ¬£10,000. Three rows of six, with one absent. My mother scans the contents of the briefcase.

‚ÄúExactly ¬£170,000, yeah? What if I asked for more, would you have had that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Do you want more?‚Äù

My mother pauses again, in stunned silence and contemplation. She considers the offer with a gravity not previously afforded to the businessman. Once again assessing the surroundings, her eyes fall and fix themselves upon me.

‚ÄúI-I mean, my boy‚Äôs off to uni soon, and it‚Äôs gonna set us back about ¬£20,000 and I‚Äôm struggling to pull‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDone.‚Äù

With resounding finality, briefcase slams shut and the clasps firmly embrace. He waits expectantly for disapproval but doesn't receive any.

‚ÄúDo we have a room around back where we may finalise our agreement?‚Äù The businessman gestures to the doorway at the back of the shop.

‚ÄúBut you haven‚Äôt even had a look around the place‚Äù

He smirks, bemused, then flails his head and neck in a frenetic scan of the room, torso and lower body remaining motionless.

‚ÄúI have, and it‚Äôs *magnificent*.‚Äù He exhales with a wry dryness. ‚ÄúShall we head around the back, if you wouldn‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to call the landlord about transferring the lease‚Ä¶‚Äù

He waves his hand in dismissal and offers a thin-lipped smile, ‚ÄúThis is mere window dressing. Please, don‚Äôt worry, I can assure you that my team and I will take care of this all for us.‚Äù

With that, they disappear behind closed doors. The cosmic dread of our first encounter now smothered in the polyester banality of contractual agreement.

Others bang ceaselessly at the broken glass of derelict properties, demanding attention from whomever resides.

It‚Äôs made of solid oak cut into sections and glued back. almost like a butcher block, but higher quality, long grain. I do not know how it‚Äôs called in english.

I am pretty pleased with the results. However my carpentner was unable to make the AV cap for me and the steam knob. So a fellow redditor from /r/turning offered to help. So I plan to work with him in February to get those parts made from oak as well. Attached are a few pics. Other than that, I will be adding brass feet and nuts. Stay tuned for part 4.

I have a friend that recently convinced me to start seeing one of her friends. She just ""knew we'd match"" and ""he's such a great guy, you'll love him"". 

Things started out pretty great at first. We met in person for a coffee date on a Friday night. I wasn't attracted to him at all. He's just not my type. But I thought attraction might grow after some time passed. He did most of the talking. Stories about how clumsy he was as a kid, how clumsy his kids are. I'm cool with it. Getting to know each other. He was probably nervous too. I know I was. It was my first real date since my divorce. Fast forward to getting cringy messages of ""I can just imagine our lives together already"" and ""I just have such a good feeling about you"". I let it slide for probably too long. I just kept thinking ""it'll get better from here. I just have to give it time."" 

We go out for a lunch date, (our second meeting in person) burgers at my favorite fast-food chain. Things were going okay. And then in the middle of eating he says something about not flushing his toilet paper. ""I'm sorry?"" I say. Hoping I heard him wrong with a mouth-full of burger, mind you. ""Yeah, I have a septic tank, and I don't flush the paper."" Appetite immediately ruined. I said ""Sooo...why don't you just get the septic tank friendly paper? And what do you do with your used toilet paper then?"" ""Saves me money...a couple hundred dollars every few years so they don't have to come out and pump the tank. And I use a garbage can."" ""Uhhh...o...okay."" I couldn't get over the fact it was a garbage can without a lid. He has two kids that are doing the same thing at his house. And all to save a little bit of money that he could just set aside out of each check to cover it? We're talking $300 every FEW YEARS. What a cheap skate. A gross cheap skate. This started arguments amongst friends because ""it's something you should try to overlook. What if it's his biggest flaw?"". Umm...no. So not only did this not lead to a relationship but also may have destroyed friendships too. 

Gross. I think I'll take a break from dating for a while. I'm gonna focus on my kids, my career, and possibly a big move out of state. Who knows what the future holds. But definitely not with someone that...doesn't flush their tp. ",10,1738092417.0,ComfortLevelPod,4,1.0,False

Y/c thought she had it all. Getting good grades in her studies, a good-paying internship, and a cozy apartment that she shared with her perfect boyfriend. She couldn't imagine her life being any different, but of course, something had to go wrong.

Y/c was about to open the door to their apartment, but before she could twist the handle, it opened. Y/c‚Äôs boyfriend stood there. His eyes were red and his cheeks were wet. ‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù He said before walking past Y/c. ‚ÄúYou have changed too much.‚Äù He whispered as the two passed each other. 

That was the last thing Y/c heard or saw from her boyfriend. He was gone, just like that. Y/c couldn't afford the apartment alone, and reluctantly she agreed to rent the spare bedroom in her best friend's apartment. 

Elias Webb, is the newest recruit at the local NHL team, Wildshore Wolfs. At the age of 24, Elias is used to live fast- on the ice and in life. He is running from a past, littered with fights, bad press, and broken promises. Determined to prove that he is more than his reputation as a hot-headed wing. When he moves into town as a fresh start, his only focus is hockey.

That was until he met y/c. 

Their first meeting was anything but romantic. Elias accidentally bumps into Y/c at a caf√©, spilling her coffee all over her. Y/c glared daggers at him. There is something about her fire, her refusal to fall at his feet like everyone else, that pulls him in. Y/c on the other end wants nothing to do with this cocky hockey player, who seemed to have fallen out of a rom-com. 

Or at least that was what she thought. 

Y/c and her friend sat watching television. There was nothing on that night, so to Y/c‚Äôs disappointment, the two ended up watching the game. Y/c telling her friend all about how the cocky player spilled her coffee. He didn't even ask to buy her a new one. 

Suddenly he was on the tv. An interviewer asked him about himself. Suddenly he got a question about what he thought about the women in town. The hockey player smirked. Revealed a missing tooth. He chuckled. ‚ÄúActually, I met one today. Pretty fierce.‚Äù He admitted. The interviewer was clearly invested. ‚ÄúThis is a long shot, but if you are watching. Call the team number. Let me buy you another coffee.‚Äù He gave a wink to the camera before walking off. 

Y/c shook her head. No way. She was not going to give in to that cocky player. However, her friend had another idea. Y/c blamed all the books her friend read. After a long discussion between the two girls, she finally gave in. Called the number and explained what had happened, to prove it was her. 

Despite their differences, they can‚Äôt seem to stay away from each other. Their connection is electric, raw, and undeniable, but it‚Äôs also messy and volatile. Elias‚Äôs temper and Y/c‚Äôs guarded heart clash in explosive arguments that always seem to end in disagreement. Their love is a whirlwind of passion and pain, marked by moments of tender vulnerability‚Äîlike Elias showing Y/c how to skate under the stars or Y/c patching him up after a brutal game fight.",1,1738092345.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

1ic9rwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ic9rwr/are_these_narcissistic_traits/,Are These Narcissistic Traits?,"Just starting to realize (thanks to Reddit), how messed up my Mom was, and her friends. Wondering are these N traits or common to Baby Boomers or are they just specific to her and her friends/flying monkeys?

  
1. Zero common sense about work and the larger world: granted, we were isolated but she grew up normal, and I have met many people 65+ with no idea how anything works and aggressive about it. An example: I help manage grants for a specific field. I will get into arguments with (her) friends and with others that a grant for say, elephant conservation will not be given to people working in vaccine research or data science. They refuse to believe this. They seem to lack any sense of what different academic subjects cover, or what different occupations do. It's all the same to them and they refuse to believe you can't just, say, walk into a hospital and get a job as an oncology nurse because you are ""nice and hardworking.""

2. One set of rules for them, one for you. My ex stole from me (read my saga), Mom would steal from me, friends tell me my exBF is a prize because he doesn't hit me. Yet same friend dumped a man for swearing in front of her. Mom would have screaming meltdowns at me for taking a tissue. BF acted like he was doing me a favor when he lent me a pair of socks. 

3. Impulsive Like Toddlers: Mom could not wait 3 minutes for me to fetch her coffee. Ex-BF who stole once spent $1000 on Legos, then had no money to feed his kids. It is also always other people's fault when they do this, because we should have stopped them. But if you try to stop them, they hate you. 

4. Want Credit for Intentions: Mom meant to send me to school, but then who would take care of her and the other women in our commune/cult? Friends mean to pay me back when I take them out to dinner. If you don't thank them for THINKING about wanting to do something, they get mad. 

5. Dump People, Then Assume They Can Come Back: Mom would get into stupid arguments with people, cut them off, then years later, try to pick up like nothing happened. My exBF would unload on me and his baby mama, block us, then show up an hour later smiling.

* I'm a 32 year old podcast producer, woman, adhd combined-type
* I really struggle with stimulants medication and want there to be more non-stimulant medications for people with adhd
* I know that a lot of people post when they have¬†*bad*¬†experiences so I'm hoping to document a potentially positive or more neutral experience

* [Post about my first month on qelbree](https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1ff4woe/documenting_my_experience_with_qelbree_week_4/)

**Dosage**¬†

* I started on 100mg, increased to 200mg in September, and to 300mg in November¬†
* In the beginning of January I also started on a small dose of buspirone 2x a day (5mg)¬†

**Current experience:**¬†

Starting on qelbree was a wild ride ‚Äî I had a whole slew of side effects that ranged from mysterious and uncomfortable to totally negative and really difficult. Most notably pretty intense and consistent insomnia and intermittent nausea. Those mostly abided in November, and then spiked again for a short time when I went up to 300mg. But now, most of the intense negative side effects seem to be mostly gone. Very occasionally I feel nauseous at night.¬†

Overall, I feel like this medication¬†**is working for me.**¬†And in the absence of negative symptoms, I‚Äôm way more able to see its positive effects.¬†

It‚Äôs a subtle influence, I am not magically cured of my ADHD by any means‚ÄîI am after all, writing this reddit post during work instead of doing the work I should be doing‚Äîhowever, I am finding that the subtle positive side effects are creating a cumulative positive effect on me.¬†

Most notably, it is just much much easier for me to start things. My activation energy is stronger and my lag time is slower. This is great. I feel like a lot of my depression and sadness comes not from wasting time, but rather, an absence of doing the things that make me feel good like calling friends, taking walks, working out, doing crafts, starting projects, planning things. And when I waste less time, and do more, I just‚Ä¶feel better. And when I feel better, I do more ‚Äî I gain confidence to try new things and thus begins a positive feedback loop instead of a negative one! Awesome awesome awesome.¬†

I am working out super consistently for the first time in maybe 10 years.¬†

I feel like 15% more organized at work, which might not seem like much, but a small improvement really can create a chain reaction of cumulative benefit. Being more on top of it, leads to being more on top of it. Being behind, leads to being more behind‚Ä¶

And as mentioned in previous posts, I also think that this medication has just helped me pay more attention in a sort of macro zoomed out way. I feel like I have more of a birds eye view of my life, I‚Äôm looking down the path before I walk it, etc.¬†

And this is complicated! Before I was sort of just vibing, with some general anxiety about my unplanned-for-future. Now I am thinking pretty deeply about what I want, how I want to live, what I want my career to be, how to manage my finances. It‚Äôs sort of like,¬†[walking into your own life¬†](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgF29qCXIAABjen.jpg)and being like¬†[damn bitch I cannot believe you live like this](https://i.redd.it/77nbto5e5kg41.jpg)

And now I‚Äôm in this philosophical, existential, process of decluttering my mind, my life, and thinking about what‚Äôs next.¬†

I also am examining my own mind in what, at least to me, feels like a clearer way.¬†

And I‚Äôve realized that a lot of what has caused my distraction is not just simply lack of attention, it‚Äôs circular thinking. My mind sort of just anxiously loops over and over and over and over again.¬†

When I think about visualizing focus, I imagine it as a straight line. When I imagine the pattern of thought in my mind, it is a constantly spiraling circle.¬†

I stop doing things, because I don‚Äôt believe I can.

I don‚Äôt start things because I obsess over the best way to do it.¬†

I don‚Äôt call people because I question if they like me.¬†

I don‚Äôt do work because I fixate on stuff that isn‚Äôt what I should be working on.¬†

Anyway, I am in therapy and my therapist is very good and helping me with some somatic stuff. Finding a good therapist is a whole different post and I‚Äôm paying out the ass for it, but it‚Äôs worth it. And I also got on a low dose of buspirone which is an anti-anxiety medication that can be used in conjunction with qelbree and WOW‚Äîthat has made a difference. My focus is night and day.¬†

I can sit down and quietly and calmly work, dare I say it‚Äôs almost pleasant. And this effect was almost immediate. I‚Äôm curious how it will feel in a few weeks when it takes full effect.¬†

Anyway, I feel sort of like wow I can‚Äôt believe society is just fully collapsing now that I got my ADHD correctly medicated after 20 years of trying but‚Ä¶better late than never, if there‚Äôs anything people with ADHD are good at it‚Äôs making up for lost time.¬†

**Other notes:**¬†

* My appetite is a little bit lower I think ‚Äî I have some bad eating habits from years of dopamine seeking / self soothing that I haven‚Äôt totally broken. But I just feel a bit less hungry at all times, which is honestly nice. Food noise was really really distracting to me before and caused me a lot of distress.¬†
* My sleep is still a little fucked up. I would like to get better about it by also improving my sleep hygiene ‚Äì no phone in bed, getting in bed earlier, and maybe even totally cutting out caffeine (I have a very small amount each day now, like one half caf coffee, I know about the qelbree caffeine effects don‚Äôt come for me). I do have extreme night time anxiety, like very very intense. I do think maybe it‚Äôs sort of gotten worse on qelbree but it also has always been pretty bad and I am feeling pretty intensely affected by Trump's election, the climate-future of the world, global politics, etc‚Ä¶idk maybe it‚Äôs a normal reaction.¬†
* I do think qelbree is pretty variable in terms of how well it works ‚Äî some days I feel really focused and some days I feel not as much. I think part of this is just normal variation, but I do get the sense that it sort of is stronger in my system at some times. It‚Äôs sort of a weird medication. I‚Äôm going to keep tracking my symptoms.¬†
* It definitely is stressful to miss a dose ‚Äî I will wake up in the middle of the night with a bad headache that will NOT go away unless I take the medication. And it's difficult to get it filled by my pharmacy, so it makes travel, and weird schedules, a bit more stressful. But I think it has a positive effect of making me much more dilligent about taking my medication which has been historically hard for me. I rarely ever miss a dose.
* I don't drink very often, like mayyyybe one drink per week. But when I do, I feel like alcohol effects me more and faster.

**TLDR:**¬†

* After four months on Qelbree, most of my negative side effects went away
* At six months I have experienced subtle improvement in focus, task initiation, and mental clarity that has had a cumulative positive effect on my life.¬†
* I am still experiencing some insomnia and nighttime anxiety.¬†
* The addition of a low dose anti anxiety medication was pretty helpful for me.¬†",3,1738091989.0,qelbree,0,1.0,False

Apologies if this is silly - but my current flat has the electricity meter about 8-9 ft up on a wall, alongside the breakers.

About 3 weeks ago, there was damage to the flat due to weather that caused all of the sockets (even when they were off I still had access to lights and shower), so I had to carry a coffee table through a narrow corridor and stand on a coffee table to access the breakers to find the solution (this was resolved 2 days later).

Should I request a stepladder to access the breaker box? I'm 90% sure it should have come with the flat, but wanted to make sure. I also cannot test any of the smoke/heat alarms due to the height of the ceiling.",1,1738091964.0,uklandlords,1,1.0,False

1ic9oks,https://www.reddit.com/r/jawsurgery/comments/1ic9oks/liquid_foods_i_ate_while_being_wired_shut/,Liquid foods I ate while being wired shut,"After six weeks recovering from **LJS overbite (10mm)** and being shut with elastic I finally got cleared to eat normally (but to start with softer foods) today. I tried eating squid (huge mistake) and later smash burger, which I ate for 30 minutes and made a mess of myself, but at least it wasn't liquid food.

For the past six weeks I basically ate almost everything that I would eat, just blended and mixed with water or milk.

There are a lot of people saying to mix something with chicken broth, but I found it disgusting. Water works much better - the taste is the same, and depending on how big a gap between the teeth you have for the food, you just make it more or less dense.

I was at the hospital for 10 days after surgery and went from 87kg to 80kg. I was never hungry there, but just didn't have enough calories (we would get milk and many kinds of soups). After I went home, I basically lost only 1.5kg for the next five weeks. I never felt sick or tired because I tried to maintain good nutrition and 2000 calorie intake per day.

My best friend was Nutribullet, but you can use any strong blender you have.

**Breakfast:**

\- **homemade protein shakes** mostly - two cups of protein powder, banana, peanut butter, milk (but generally just freestyled with different variations). When I was lazy I would just drink store bought ones (which had around 330kcal).

\- **egg omelet** with chicken breast deli and cheese, blended with water. Wasn't a huge fan of this, but did the job when I got tired of protein shakes.

**Lunch:**

I live in the Balkans, so we have a lot of cooked options, even for Wolt and Glovo delivery (so it was easy when my wife and I weren't in the mood to cook (and I'm never in that mood)). I didn't eat instant foods like noodles or similar. Things I ate the most are:

\- **chicken with soya sauce** (or Holandaice or any other sauce) and rice, blender with water. My favorite thing by far.

\- **braised veal with rice** \- also great

\- our local dishes sarma and stuffed paprika. The first one has minced meat mixed with rice and vegetables in a cabbage shell, and the second one is the same, only with paprika. It was so fucking good.

\- I tried blending salads like side dishes. It was ok, but wasn't a fan. But, the whole blending thing helped me eat healthy things I usually hate like broccoli - I would just add it to random blended meals I had.

\- The only thing I didn't even try (that I like) was fish like salmon. I just feared it would be awful.

\- I ate a lot of **barbecued minced** meat, like ƒáevapi (which is similar to kebabs). It's actually pretty good, even in liquid form. Once, I even ate a **smash burger**, but that wasn't so good. Basically, the first version was great, but still a little bit dense to go through a straw, so I had to dilute it further and all the butter from the bread just released (yes, I put the whole thing inside), and it was just too greasy. Once, I put a patty with sauce and a handful of french fries in a blender - and it was more than okay.

\- I even tried blending **pizza pie** (as the name says - it's a homemade pie with pizza filling) and it was pretty great. Didn't try to blend regular pizza, but I feel the taste would be the same. 

**Snacks:**

I drank **homemade lemonade**, that and **tea** helped a lot in the recovery. Also, a bunch of **homemade juices**. I tried to stay away from coffee because I couldn't clean my teeth very well. I didn't drink sodas (except one or two glasses of Coca Cola Zero for those six weeks).

The only real joy I found was in the **plazma shake** (a super popular type of milkshake in my country). Basically, it's ground biscuit and milk. But, because I am a pig in my heart, I would add 4-6 bars of **kinder chocolate**. And I must tell you - it tasted like heaven. Also, even though it had like 1000 calories, I didn't give a fuck because I was always in deficit.

**TLDR and the whole point of this post: You shouldn't be afraid to experiment with food. When blended with water, it has the exact same taste; the texture is just different.**",11,1738091933.0,jawsurgery,5,1.0,False

That‚Äôs where Bitcoin Jumper comes in‚Äîour innovative Bitcoin transaction accelerator app designed to make sluggish transactions a thing of the past. Let‚Äôs explore how Bitcoin Jumper works and why it‚Äôs the ultimate tool for streamlining your Bitcoin experience.

# Understanding Bitcoin Transaction Delays

Before we dive into the specifics of Bitcoin Jumper, it‚Äôs important to understand why Bitcoin transactions sometimes lag. Bitcoin operates on a blockchain, a decentralized ledger where transactions are verified and added in blocks. Here‚Äôs why delays can occur:

1. **Network Congestion:** When too many transactions flood the network, miners prioritize transactions with higher fees, leaving lower-fee transactions in a backlog.
2. **Low Transaction Fees:** Transactions with minimal fees are often placed on hold, waiting for miners to process higher-paying ones first.
3. **Block Size Limitations:** Each block on the Bitcoin blockchain has a size limit of 1 MB, which can only hold a finite number of transactions.

These delays can range from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the network‚Äôs activity and your transaction‚Äôs fee. Bitcoin Jumper addresses these issues head-on, giving you the power to speed things up with ease.

I woke up today and it felt like all of the wounds were closed only bearing a raised scar. I never thought this day would come, especially so soon. I made a cup of coffee. My mind didn't dwell on all of the things you had touched in this place. or all of the places you've sat. I walked outside. I used to watch the weather over where I thought you were. Searching for sun or storms, wondering how you are. I wasn't busy, but my mind didn't have time to do that today, perhaps from all of the empty guessing it has done in the past.
 I had a date, but flaked, I wasn't ready to go, and didn't want to go. I don't know if I will be for a long time. I told the person not to waste their time, and I felt bad about it. The season of love is quickly approaching and I think people are frantically searching for that quick hit of romance. Not me. The space left by you I'm slowly filling with the things that should have filled it. I spend late nights up laughing with strangers. I spend days creating a life that is full of smiles.
As I looked up and saw the grey clouds over where I'm sure you are today all I could think is that I hope you are well. And that you keep those grey clouds over there and away from here. What a gift that would be...

The Yamaha FG800J NT is one of those guitars that sneaks up on you, offering a mix of quality and playability that punches above its weight class. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs got enough charm to make me reach for it on casual jam sessions or late-night songwriting sprees.

Imagine this: I‚Äôm sitting in my living room with a cup of tea, the Yamaha FG800J NT in hand, trying to work out the chords to a song stuck in my head. It‚Äôs a natural finish beauty, with a traditional dreadnought design that feels both classic and inviting. The solid spruce top paired with mahogany and nato wood back and sides makes it visually appealing. The craftsmanship doesn‚Äôt scream luxury, but it doesn‚Äôt feel budget either. It‚Äôs the kind of guitar that doesn‚Äôt pretend to be something it‚Äôs not, and I respect that.

Let‚Äôs talk about the neck and fretboard. The rosewood fretboard feels smooth, and its satin-finished nato neck offers a comfortable grip, even after an hour or two of playing. My 12-year-old nephew, who‚Äôs just transitioning from ukulele, had no issues adapting to the fingerboard. However, if you‚Äôre someone with smaller hands, the dreadnought size might feel a bit chunky. Playability is where this guitar shines; it‚Äôs forgiving enough for beginners but still satisfying for seasoned players like me. That said, I had to tweak the action a bit. Out of the box, it was playable, but not ideal. A quick trip to the local guitar tech for adjustments made a world of difference.

When it‚Äôs time to strum, the Yamaha FG800J NT delivers a balanced tone with a hint of warmth, thanks to its scalloped bracing. It‚Äôs versatile enough to handle fingerpicking, basic chords, or even belting out power chords (yes, I tried). The low-end projection is robust without being muddy, while the midrange is clear, and the highs are crisp. It‚Äôs not a Martin or a Taylor, but for the price, it‚Äôs more than respectable. One caveat: the factory-installed phosphor bronze strings didn‚Äôt do it for me. Swapping them out for Elixirs brought out its true tonal potential.

**Pros**

* Balanced, versatile tonal quality for various playing styles.
* Solid spruce top construction offers durability and better sound projection.
* Comfortable satin-finished neck and smooth rosewood fretboard.
* Affordable yet feels premium for its price range.
* Lightweight and easy to handle, even during extended sessions.

**Cons**

* Action needed adjustment out of the box for optimal playability.
* Factory strings could be better; consider replacing them immediately.
* Dreadnought size may not suit players with smaller hands.
* Lacks some of the intricate detailing found in higher-end guitars.
* Could benefit from more visible fretboard inlays for beginners.

When you stack it up against competitors in its category, the Yamaha FG800J NT holds its ground impressively. Compared to something like the Fender CD-60S, the Yamaha wins in tonal depth and playability. The Fender might have a slightly sleeker look, but its laminated top doesn‚Äôt quite match the robust sound projection of Yamaha‚Äôs solid spruce. On the other hand, brands like Epiphone offer solid alternatives in this price range, but their tone often feels less balanced, leaning too heavily on bass or treble.

Cost-wise, the Yamaha FG800J NT strikes a fine balance. It‚Äôs not dirt cheap, but it‚Äôs far from breaking the bank. For a beginner, it‚Äôs an investment that won‚Äôt feel like a waste if you decide guitar isn‚Äôt for you. For an intermediate or even advanced player, it‚Äôs a reliable backup instrument that you won‚Äôt mind taking on trips or casual gigs. While you can spend twice as much on a brand like Taylor to get a more refined sound, this Yamaha gives you a lot of bang for your buck.

Let‚Äôs not forget the features. This guitar includes a fixed bridge system, which is sturdy and reliable. The phosphor bronze strings it comes with are decent for a start but, as mentioned, swapping them out is a good idea. The overall size and dreadnought build make it a great choice for projecting sound in group settings, though it‚Äôs equally capable in solo performances. The satin neck finish is a subtle but welcome touch, especially for those of us who hate sticky necks during long sessions.

One amusing incident: I took this guitar to a family barbeque, and my aunt (who knows nothing about guitars) commented on how ‚Äúfancy‚Äù it looked. Meanwhile, my musician cousin was genuinely impressed by its sound quality. If a single guitar can impress both a non-musician and a player with a decade of experience, that‚Äôs saying something.

I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years now and I'm about to propose. I wrote a book about it its about an hour long read. Its based mostly on real events, but there are some things added for the purpose of a good story.

One of my female friends after I sent it to her said ""I'm so mad, I pride myself on not crying for sappy stories, and yours made me cry""

Let me know what you think.

# Prologue: Dedication

# This story is for the two people who changed my life in ways I‚Äôll never forget.

# To Winters, my cousin, my brother, my compass in the darkest moments. You were the unshakable force I measured myself against, the one who taught me what it meant to push forward even when the weight felt unbearable. Your strength carried me through when I couldn‚Äôt find my own. I‚Äôve spent every day since that road trying to live in a way that would make you proud, even when I didn‚Äôt know how. This story exists because of the lessons you left behind, and though you‚Äôre no longer here, your voice echoes in every word.

# And to Alyssa, the woman who taught me that love could be both the most exhilarating and terrifying thing I‚Äôve ever known. You brought me back to life when I thought I was too broken to feel again. Every chapter of this story is a reflection of what you‚Äôve meant to me‚Äîthe joy, the pain, the laughter, the tears. You made me believe in something bigger than myself, something I didn‚Äôt think I was capable of anymore.

# This story isn‚Äôt just mine‚Äîit‚Äôs ours.

# For Winters, who showed me how to endure.

**For Alyssa, who showed me how to love.**

# May we never forget what it means to truly feel.

There are people who seem unshakable, as though nothing in the world could ever break them. Winters was one of those people. My cousin, my brother in all but name, and the one I always measured myself against. Where I doubted, he pushed forward. Where I hesitated, he acted. I used to wonder how he carried that strength so easily, as if it didn‚Äôt weigh him down.

It was him I thought of every time I felt like giving up.¬†*What would Winters do?*¬†That question carried me through more than I could ever admit.

But in the unforgiving deserts of Afghanistan, even the unshakable can be brought to their knees. I was 17, running from home and joined the Marine Corps with my cousin. Anything to get away.¬†

The convoy rumbled down the barren road, the sun beating down relentlessly as we kicked up clouds of dust that lingered in the air like ghosts. Winters was in the passenger seat of the Humvee ahead of mine, his arm draped lazily over the window frame. He looked like he didn‚Äôt have a care in the world, but that was Winters. Cool as ice, no matter where we were or what was waiting for us up ahead.

The radio crackled to life, his voice cutting through the static. ‚ÄúOchs, I don‚Äôt know who taught you how to drive, but they should be court-martialed.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes, gripping the wheel tighter. ‚ÄúYeah, well, at least I don‚Äôt need a booster seat to see over the dash.‚Äù

His laugh came back over the line, low and easy. ‚ÄúCute. Keep talking like that and you‚Äôll be the one scrubbing Humvees when we get back.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if you survive long enough to give the order,‚Äù I shot back, smirking despite the heat and the nerves that never quite went away out here.

He barked out another laugh. ‚ÄúJust try to keep up, Grandma.‚Äù

It was always like that with him‚Äîsharp, relentless, and funny in a way that made the weight of where we were feel lighter, even if only for a moment.

But moments like that didn‚Äôt last here.

The explosion came out of nowhere, a blinding flash of light and heat that swallowed everything. The lead Humvee was gone in an instant, replaced by a fireball of twisted metal and black smoke. My foot slammed on the brakes, the radio erupting in chaos as the sharp crack of gunfire filled the air.

‚ÄúIED! IED!‚Äù someone shouted, their voice barely audible over the roar of the ambush.

Before I could even register what was happening, Winters was out of the Humvee. That was him‚Äîalways the first to react, always running toward the danger while the rest of us were still trying to process it.

‚ÄúWinters!‚Äù I shouted, throwing my door open, but the sound of my voice was lost in the chaos.

He was moving toward the wreckage, rifle at the ready, when the shot rang out.

One moment, he was there. The next, he wasn‚Äôt.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat as I watched him fall. It was like time slowed down, every detail burned into my mind‚Äîthe way his body crumpled to the ground, the spray of blood against the sand, the stillness that followed.

I didn‚Äôt think. I couldn‚Äôt. My legs carried me forward before I could process the danger, before I could convince myself to stop. Bullets whizzed past me, pinging off the metal of the convoy, but I didn‚Äôt care.

When I reached him, I dropped to my knees, my hands trembling as I grabbed his vest and tried to pull him behind cover. But there was no point.

The wound was in his head, and he was gone.

I don‚Äôt know how long I stayed there, kneeling in the dirt, staring at the body of the one person I thought could never fall. At some point, someone pulled me back‚Äîdragged me away from him and into the relative safety of the convoy. All I could see was Winters‚Äîhis blood on my hands, his laughter echoing in my ears like a phantom.

I left a piece of myself on that road. A piece I never got back. In that Desert. That fucking desert.¬†

# Chapter Two: The Weight of Silence

The ride back to base felt longer than it should have. The dust hung in the air, thick and heavy, clinging to the windows and coating everything it touched. I gripped the steering wheel tightly, my knuckles pale, my hands trembling despite my best efforts to steady them. No one said much. The radio crackled occasionally with a distant voice or a half-finished sentence, but it was as though we‚Äôd all silently agreed that words wouldn‚Äôt change anything.

Winters was gone.

At the base, everything moved like clockwork. Orders were given, protocols followed, reports filed. I did what I was told, but it felt like I was watching myself from the outside, my body moving on autopilot. They took his body first, zipping it into a black bag and carrying it away with quiet efficiency. I stood there, staring at the space he‚Äôd been, the dust swirling over the bloodstained ground.

I didn‚Äôt cry. Not then.

That night, I sat on the edge of my cot, staring at the floor. The hum of the base, the distant voices of other Marines, and the occasional clatter of equipment filtered through the thin walls, but it all felt muted. I could still hear him in my head‚Äîcalling me¬†*Ochs,*¬†laughing at something stupid, telling me to hurry up or keep up. His voice was so clear it was almost cruel.

I didn‚Äôt cry. Not then. I just sat there, hollowed out and empty, replaying the moment over and over in my mind. The explosion. The gunfire. The way he fell. The way the blood soaked into the sand.

The next day, and the day after that, I threw myself into work. There wasn‚Äôt much else to do. I kept my head down, followed orders, and stayed busy. Busy meant not thinking too much. Busy meant I didn‚Äôt have to feel it.

But the nights were harder. When the noise died down and the base grew quiet, I could feel the weight of it pressing on my chest. Winters was gone. The one person I thought couldn‚Äôt fall‚Äîthe one I always thought would drag me back to my feet‚Äîwasn‚Äôt here anymore.

**Weeks Later**

The weeks blurred together into a haze of heat and dust. I counted the days until we‚Äôd rotate out, not because I wanted to leave‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt sure what waited for me back home‚Äîbut because I didn‚Äôt want to stay. Every road looked like the one where I‚Äôd left him. Every moment of quiet felt like a threat.

I found myself alone more often than not. My bunkmates tried to pull me into card games or conversations, but I wasn‚Äôt interested. I told myself I was fine, that I didn‚Äôt need anyone, but the truth was, I didn‚Äôt want to let anyone in.

The night before we shipped out, I found myself in the motor pool, staring at the Humvees lined up in neat rows. The air was cooler than usual, the kind of quiet that settles after the sun dips below the horizon. My fingers traced the edge of a steering wheel, the worn leather smooth under my touch.

For a moment, I could almost hear him again.

‚ÄúOchs, you‚Äôre driving like a damn grandma.‚Äù

The words came unbidden, catching me off guard. I laughed, a sharp, bitter sound that didn‚Äôt feel like mine. And then, finally, I cried.

It wasn‚Äôt loud or dramatic. Just a quiet, steady release that I couldn‚Äôt stop, no matter how hard I tried. I stayed there until the tears stopped, until the weight on my chest felt just a little lighter.

**Fast Forward: A New Beginning**

Years later, I was back home. The uniform had been folded and tucked away, the medals sealed in a box that I didn‚Äôt open. On paper, I‚Äôd moved on. I was a businessman now, successful in ways that people admired. A house in a nice neighborhood, a car that turned heads, a reputation for being driven and dependable. People said I was thriving.

But inside, I felt like a shell of the man I‚Äôd been. Winters‚Äô voice was still with me, though it was quieter now‚Äîa faint whisper that echoed in the back of my mind. I spent every day trying to live up to the man he thought I could be, but the truth was, I didn‚Äôt even know who that man was anymore.

I went through the motions. Work. Meetings. Networking events. I learned how to smile when people asked about my success, how to nod along in conversations about investments and market trends. People saw what they wanted to see‚Äîa man who had it all together. They didn‚Äôt see the cracks.

The truth was, I never stopped hearing him. His voice would come to me in the quiet moments, when I was alone in my car or standing in the kitchen, staring at the coffee pot. He wasn‚Äôt really there, but it felt like he was, watching, waiting, judging.

**Chapter 2: Her Favorite Number**

It was my birthday‚ÄîDecember 11th.

The snow fell steadily that night, blanketing the streets in quiet. The air was sharp, the kind of cold that made your breath visible, but it had a beauty to it. The lights of the city reflected off the fresh snow, painting everything in a soft, golden glow.

Sierra, my girlfriend, had insisted we go out. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not spending your birthday on the couch,‚Äù she‚Äôd said earlier, tugging me toward the door. ‚ÄúCome on, Jacob. You need this.‚Äù

She meant well. She always did. And maybe she was right. I went through the motions, putting on a jacket, grabbing my keys, and stepping into the night. But as we walked to the car, I couldn‚Äôt shake the heaviness in my chest.

The rooftop bar was the kind of place Sierra loved‚Äîtrendy, loud, full of people who looked like they belonged there. Twinkling lights crisscrossed the ceiling, casting everything in a warm, golden haze. The hum of conversation filled the room, punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter or the clink of glasses.

I sat at the table with Sierra and a few of her friends, smiling when I needed to, nodding when someone asked me a question. I let them talk, let their voices blend into the background.

‚ÄúHappy birthday, Jacob,‚Äù Sierra said softly, leaning into me. Her hand rested on my arm, warm and familiar.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, managing a small smile.

She meant well. But the truth was, I didn‚Äôt feel much like celebrating.

My gaze drifted to the bar, scanning the crowd without thinking. People came and went, chatting and laughing, their faces flushed from the cold or the drinks in their hands.

And then I saw her.

She wasn‚Äôt sitting or chatting like the others. She was searching for something, her movements calm but deliberate. Her eyes scanned the bar top, flicking briefly to the floor, then back again. It wasn‚Äôt frantic or rushed‚Äîit was purposeful, like she knew exactly what she was looking for and wasn‚Äôt going to leave until she found it.

I knew who she was.

We‚Äôd talked before‚Äîonline, in passing‚Äîbut this was the first time I‚Äôd seen her in person. She was striking in a way that was hard to describe. Her jeans fit her perfectly, her heels clicked softly as she moved, and the sparkly grey top she wore shimmered faintly under the lights. But it wasn‚Äôt just her appearance that held my attention.

She carried herself with a quiet confidence, even while looking for something she‚Äôd lost.

I sat there, frozen, watching as she moved. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her brow furrowing for a moment before her lips curved into the faintest of smiles.

For a moment, I wondered if she‚Äôd found what she was looking for. But then her gaze swept the bar again, still searching.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt approach her. I just sat there, watching.

Sierra‚Äôs voice pulled me back. ‚ÄúJacob? Are you okay?‚Äù

I blinked, forcing my attention back to her. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said quickly. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ thought I saw someone I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù she asked, glancing toward the bar. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one,‚Äù I said, shaking my head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù

But it wasn‚Äôt nothing.

When I glanced back, the girl was gone.

The conversation at the table continued without me. Sierra laughed at something one of her friends said, leaning into my side like she always did when she was relaxed. But I couldn‚Äôt focus. My thoughts kept drifting back to her.

‚ÄúI need to hit the bathroom,‚Äù I said, standing abruptly.

Sierra gave me a questioning look but nodded. ‚ÄúOkay. Don‚Äôt take too long.‚Äù

I nodded, already walking away.

Downstairs, away from the noise and the lights, I leaned against the bathroom counter, staring at my reflection in the mirror. My friend Christian walked in a moment later, drying his hands on a paper towel.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, man? You‚Äôre looking‚Ä¶ off,‚Äù he said, his voice casual but curious.

I hesitated, running a hand through my hair. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs here,‚Äù I said finally.

He frowned. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe girl,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe one I told you about. From online.‚Äù

Christian raised an eyebrow, his lips pulling into a grin. ‚ÄúNo way. The one you‚Äôve been talking about for weeks? She‚Äôs here?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, exhaling sharply. ‚ÄúShe was at the bar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, did you talk to her?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I admitted, shaking my head. ‚ÄúShe was looking for something. I didn‚Äôt‚ÄîI just watched her.‚Äù

Christian laughed, clapping me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hopeless, you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut, man‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never seen anyone like her. She just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

He studied me for a moment, his grin fading slightly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said quietly. ‚ÄúI am.‚Äù

Back at the table, Sierra was relaxed, smiling at her friends, oblivious to the turmoil in my chest. I kept glancing toward the bar, half-expecting to see Alyssa again. But she was gone.

My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I pulled it out. Her name lit up the screen, and my chest tightened.

**Alyssa:**¬†*Did I just see you at 360?*

My thumb hovered over the screen. I could tell her the truth. Or I could lie.

What I said was somewhere in between.

**Me:**¬†*Yeah, you did. And I‚Äôm going to be honest‚ÄîI‚Äôm here with my ex.*

The reply came faster than I expected.

**Alyssa:**¬†*I think it‚Äôs best if we just be friends.*

Her words felt like a punch to the gut, but I couldn‚Äôt blame her. My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, feeling like the ground beneath me had shifted. I should‚Äôve let it go. But I couldn‚Äôt.

**Me:**¬†*If that‚Äôs the case, then let‚Äôs get coffee tomorrow. Friends can get coffee, right?*

Her response didn‚Äôt come immediately. For a moment, I thought she wasn‚Äôt going to reply. But then the screen lit up again.

**Alyssa:**¬†*Fine. Coffee. You‚Äôre lucky its your birthday‚Ä¶*

I exhaled, relief and panic swirling in my chest. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I had to see her again.

**Chapter 3: Ball‚Äôs in My Court**

The coffee shop was quiet when I walked in, the warm smell of roasted beans greeting me as the bell above the door chimed softly. The place had a charm to it‚Äîmismatched chairs, a handwritten menu on the wall, and the kind of ambiance that made you want to linger.

But as I scanned the room, my stomach twisted.

She wasn‚Äôt there.

I glanced at my watch, checked my phone, and frowned. Had I gotten the time wrong? Or maybe she‚Äôd changed her mind. The thought settled heavily in my chest. I paced slowly past the tables, my eyes darting to every corner, searching for her face. Nothing.

I pulled out my phone, swiping to her number. I hit the call button, holding it to my ear as I stood there, unsure if I wanted her to answer or if I‚Äôd have to leave with my pride barely intact.

Then, I heard the faint sound of a phone ringing.

I looked around and froze. Her phone was sitting on the table right next to me.

Before I could process what was happening, she walked out of the bathroom.

There she was, as stunning in person as I remembered from the rooftop bar, if not more. Her hair framed her face perfectly, and her lips curved into an easy smile the moment our eyes met.

‚ÄúHey there, Miss Alyssa,‚Äù I said, my voice steady despite the nerves twisting in my stomach.

‚ÄúHey, Mr. Jacob,‚Äù she replied, her voice teasing and warm.

Even though it had been just a few weeks since we‚Äôd first exchanged messages, we already had nicknames for each other‚Äîpet names that felt more natural than they should have. It was strange how quickly she‚Äôd become familiar, like she‚Äôd always been part of my life in some way.

We sat down, and within moments, the conversation flowed as if we‚Äôd done this a hundred times before. She told me about her life, her values, her goals. She was confident, ambitious, and unapologetically herself.

She‚Äôd just quit her corporate job to take a huge risk‚Äîpursuing something she believed in. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why I should wait,‚Äù she said, her voice steady but passionate. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not happy where you are, you owe it to yourself to try.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just what she said that struck me, but the way she said it‚Äîlike she was daring the world to challenge her.

I admired that.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done that before,‚Äù I told her, nodding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy. Most people don‚Äôt have the guts to walk away from stability for something uncertain.‚Äù

She smiled, her confidence shining through. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not like most people.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt lying.

But then, in a moment of endearing contrast, she asked me for help putting her laptop case on.

I laughed, shaking my head. ‚ÄúMiss Independent, huh?‚Äù

She laughed with me, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúHey, even independent women need help sometimes.‚Äù

The hours slipped by without either of us noticing. We talked about everything‚Äîher trip to the Hawaii, her family, the things she wanted out of life. The more she spoke, the more I realized how aligned our goals were, how much she valued the same things I did.

And she was gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.

It wasn‚Äôt just her looks, though those were hard to ignore. It was the way she carried herself, the way she spoke with conviction and passion. She had this presence about her that was impossible to look away from.

When it was finally time to leave, I walked her to her car. The snow had started to fall again, soft flakes drifting down around us as we stood by her door. I opened it for her, and she gave me a look‚Äîhalf amused, half appreciative.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to do that,‚Äù she said, setting her laptop inside.

I shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just who I am.‚Äù

We stood there for a moment, talking, the conversation gradually fading into a comfortable silence. She looked at me then, her eyes meeting mine in a way that felt different.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúDo I see you again?‚Äù

I hesitated for a second, searching her face. ‚ÄúDo you want to?‚Äù

Her lips curved into a small smile. ‚ÄúBall‚Äôs in your court.‚Äù

Her eyes lingered on mine, and for a moment, I didn‚Äôt know what to say. There was something in her gaze‚Äîa quiet intensity, an invitation.

‚ÄúBall‚Äôs in my court,‚Äù I repeated softly, more to myself than to her.

I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen next. But I decided to take the risk.

I leaned in.

She met me halfway, throwing herself into the kiss with a passion I wasn‚Äôt expecting. It wasn‚Äôt just a kiss‚Äîit was electric, magnetic. She didn‚Äôt hold back, and neither did I.

When we finally pulled away, breathless, she smirked. ‚ÄúYou know how to play ball.‚Äù

Later, as I drove to a meeting I could barely focus on, my phone buzzed.

**Me:**¬†*I almost didn‚Äôt make it to my meeting. You kept me there longer than I planned.*

Her response was immediate.

**Alyssa:**¬†*I could‚Äôve made you stay all night if I wanted to.*

I stared at her message, my chest tightening. I didn‚Äôt know what to feel. She was amazing, and being with her felt right.

But Sierra was still at home.

**Chapter 4: Never Been More Sure**

After the kiss in the parking lot, it felt impossible to stop thinking about her. Alyssa had this gravitational pull, this presence that stayed with me long after I left her.

We texted constantly, every message making me feel closer to her and farther away from everything else. She was addictive‚Äîher humor, her confidence, the way she made me feel like I was truly seen.

But every time my phone buzzed, I had to hide it. Sierra didn‚Äôt suspect anything yet, but the guilt was building. I couldn‚Äôt ignore the fact that I was living a double life.

It didn‚Äôt stop me.

The next day, Alyssa and I made plans.

‚ÄúI usually don‚Äôt let guys come over this early,‚Äù she texted, followed by a winking face. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôll just get some work done. Promise.‚Äù

I stared at the message, knowing that ‚Äújust work‚Äù was the last thing I wanted to do with her.

When I arrived at her apartment, she opened the door wearing cream-colored baggy sweatpants and an oversized hoodie. It was the most casual outfit imaginable, but she still looked stunning. Effortlessly so.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, her smile warm and inviting.

‚ÄúHey Ms. Alyssa,‚Äù I replied, stepping inside.

Her apartment smelled faintly of vanilla and coffee, and the space felt like her‚Äîcozy, understated, and full of little personal touches. A laptop sat open on the table, alongside a notebook and a pen. She‚Äôd been working, as promised, but I wasn‚Äôt here for that.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs sit,‚Äù she said, gesturing to the couch.

I followed her, and for a while, we talked about her business. She explained how she was diving into affiliate marketing, taking risks, and betting on herself. It was inspiring, listening to her talk about her goals with such conviction.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been the type to take the leap,‚Äù she said, tucking her legs beneath her on the couch.

I nodded. ‚ÄúI can see that. Most people don‚Äôt have that kind of guts.‚Äù

She smiled, but her eyes lingered on mine for a moment longer than necessary.

And then it happened again.

That look.

It was the same look she‚Äôd given me at the coffee shop‚Äîthe one that made the world slow down and fade away.

We held each other‚Äôs gaze, and I could feel the shift in the air, the way the space between us seemed to disappear.

I leaned in first, but she met me halfway. Our lips connected, and suddenly, nothing else mattered.

One thing led to another.

Before I knew it, I was on top of her, the two of us tangled on the couch. Her hands rested lightly on my shoulders, and she pulled back for a second, her breathing uneven.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt usually do this,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúNot this early.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure we should?‚Äù

I looked into her eyes, and my voice was steady when I replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been more sure about anything in my life.‚Äù

Her lips parted slightly, and then she pulled me back to her.

We ended up in her bedroom, the moments blurring together in a rush of passion and intensity.

When our lips met again, something changed. It wasn‚Äôt just a kiss‚Äîit was more than that. We‚Äôd pause between kisses, our mouths open, our breaths mingling as if we were holding ourselves back from something bigger. It wasn‚Äôt restraint‚Äîit was connection.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. It was like something invisible passed between us, electricity coursing through my chest and into hers, and then back again. It wasn‚Äôt just want or desire‚Äîit was need.

In those moments, it felt like our souls were speaking to each other in a language we didn‚Äôt understand but could still feel.

Her hands clung to my shoulders, and mine found their way to the back of her head. My fingers curled into her hair as we pulled back to look at each other, our eyes locking in an intensity that stole the air from my lungs.

I couldn‚Äôt speak. I couldn‚Äôt think. All I could do was stare at her, at the way her chest rose and fell, her lips parted and trembling.

Her eyes, wide and dark, held mine like a tether. I could see everything in them‚Äîthe same longing, the same electricity, the same pull that I felt.

It wasn‚Äôt just passion. It was something deeper, something that I didn‚Äôt fully understand but knew I never wanted to lose.

Afterward, we lay there, breathless, tangled in the sheets. She turned to me, her hair slightly messy, and laughed softly.

‚ÄúOkay, what the fuck was that?‚Äù she said, her voice full of wonder.

‚ÄúMy soul just left my body‚Äù

I laughed, pulling her closer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm not complaining.‚Äù

She looked up at me, her expression softening. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never‚Ä¶ that was‚Ä¶‚Äù She paused, searching for the words.

‚ÄúThe best?‚Äù I offered, grinning.

‚ÄúThe best,‚Äù she agreed, shaking her head as if she couldn‚Äôt believe it.

Later, as I drove home, I couldn‚Äôt stop replaying the day in my mind. The way she looked at me. The way she kissed me. The way I‚Äôd felt so sure in that moment, like everything I‚Äôd done, every risk I‚Äôd taken, had led me to her.

But reality was waiting for me when I walked through the door.

Sierra was there, sitting on the couch, her face lighting up when she saw me.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, her voice cheerful. ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I lied, forcing a smile.

The guilt gnawed at me, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to make me stop. I couldn‚Äôt stop.

Because Alyssa wasn‚Äôt just someone I wanted. She was the person I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without.

# Chapter 5: Two Lives, One Heart

The days that followed felt like a balancing act I was destined to fail.

On one hand, there was Sierra‚Äîstable, kind, and familiar. The life we‚Äôd built together was comfortable, even if it no longer felt right. She didn‚Äôt suspect a thing, her trust in me unwavering, which only made the guilt heavier.

On the other hand, there was Alyssa‚Äîa force of nature who had completely flipped my world upside down. She was the unknown, the risk, the fire I couldn‚Äôt extinguish even if I wanted to.

I wanted her. I needed her.

But the more I fell into Alyssa‚Äôs world, the more I felt like a man standing on a crumbling ledge, unsure of which side I‚Äôd land on when it all fell apart.

We kept seeing each other.

It wasn‚Äôt just about the physical connection, though that was undeniable. It was the way we talked for hours about everything and nothing, the way she made me feel seen in a way I hadn‚Äôt in years. She had this ability to pull me out of my own head, to make me laugh when I didn‚Äôt think I could, to challenge me in ways I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

She was electric.

One night, after sneaking away to see her, I drove home feeling the weight of what I was doing pressing against my chest. The car was quiet except for the low hum of the radio, but my mind was loud, swirling with thoughts I couldn‚Äôt escape.

Sierra was waiting for me when I walked in, curled up on the couch in one of my old sweatshirts.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said, smiling as I closed the door. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home late.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, shrugging off my jacket. ‚ÄúGot caught up with work.‚Äù

She nodded, her eyes warm and trusting as she gestured to the spot next to her. ‚ÄúCome sit.‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment before walking over and sinking into the cushions beside her. She leaned into me, her head resting on my shoulder, and I felt the familiar ache of guilt settle in my chest.

‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù she asked, her voice soft.

‚ÄúIt was fine,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile.

She didn‚Äôt press further, content to sit in silence, but I couldn‚Äôt relax. My mind was miles away, replaying the moments I‚Äôd spent with Alyssa earlier that evening‚Äîthe way her laugh had filled the room, the way she‚Äôd leaned into me as we talked, the way her touch had left my skin burning long after she‚Äôd pulled away.

I started to realize how much I was changing.

Work had always been my priority, my anchor. But now, I found myself rescheduling meetings, cutting calls short, and rearranging my entire life just to carve out more time with her.

It wasn‚Äôt logical, and it wasn‚Äôt smart, but it didn‚Äôt matter.

She was my priority now.

One evening, as we lay tangled together on her couch, her head resting on my chest, she tilted her face up to look at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on in that head of yours, Mr. Jacob?‚Äù she asked, her voice playful but curious.

I smiled, brushing a strand of hair from her face. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to know.‚Äù

She raised an eyebrow, propping herself up on her elbow. ‚ÄúTry me.‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment before answering. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about how much I‚Äôve changed since I met you.‚Äù

Her lips curved into a small smile. ‚ÄúGood changes or bad?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I said without hesitation. ‚ÄúScary, but good.‚Äù ‚ÄúLike a breath of fresh air‚Ä¶‚Äù

She studied me for a moment, her smile fading slightly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a hard one to figure out, you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBut I like it. You keep me guessing.‚Äù

I reached up, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúYou do the same to me, Miss Alyssa.‚Äù

That night, as I drove home, I felt a sense of clarity I hadn‚Äôt felt in weeks.

Alyssa wasn‚Äôt just a spark in the chaos of my life. She was the calm in the storm, the thing that made everything else fade away.

And the more time I spent with her, the more I realized something that scared me to my core.

1ic94x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ic94x9/25lbs_down_since_august_what_i_did_and_what_i/,25lbs down since August! What I did and what I noticed...,"I am a woman that turned 40 in August. I was 217lbs, still am 5 feet 8 inches tall. Large chest, solid bones, never had kids. I have hypo-thyroid and take medications to maintain a low-normal metabolism level.   
Age, gender, bone density, chest size, and metabolism efficiency all factor heavily into weight gain/loss/maintenance. If you are a woman, you actually lose a small percentage of bone density for every fetus you grow inside you. Not a single chart or math equation out there takes that into consideration when telling you how much you ""should"" weigh as a woman.   
Also, ""race"" factors in. You are going to hold your weight differently depending on your genetic makeup. There is not a single perfect solution/equation for all of the human race for weight loss and body fat percentage calculation. Take all that stuff with a grain of salt, but maybe not because there's too much salt in everything already LOL 

ANYHOW,  
I've been unhappy with my body shape, especially my belly fat. I want to feel sexy again. I want to be healthy. I want to keep living a life that I am functional and mobile in. I found my motivation to suffer for what I want instead of suffering because of what I am. And let me tell you, there IS some suffering when starting a weight loss journey. Teaching your body to stop eating so much, or the wrong things, is HARD. It's like trying to care for an untrained dog. 

How did I start?   
Calorie counting apps are great. Knowing what you are putting into your body helps your mind wrap around the points of greatest calorie consumption. Cream and icecream were my biggest downfall. I love the stuff.   
The changes I made:  
No more cream in the coffee! I had already cut sugar out of my coffee, but couldn't give up the cream for the longest time, and I drink a LOT of coffee so it was really adding up.   
No more juice. I work at a place where I get free access to the juice machine, and I was consuming a lot of orange juice and cranberry juice. Vitamin C! Yay!! But... So much SUGAR. I started using my Soda Stream again and the Bubly drops, but any ""no sugars, no calories"" water flavouring will do. A lot of my extra calorie consumption was just my body craving flavour, not actual food/sugar.   
CHEESE.   
I had to greatly cut back on cheese and it has made me a bit sad, but I've cut a LOT of calories out by decreasing cheese. On other dairy products like cottage cheese and sour cream, switching to the lower fat options have allowed me to keep them in my diet at the same levels as before.   
PROCESSED foods!!   
Especially meats and bread products have a lot of ""empty"" calories. There are some great articles and youtube videos out there on how our ultra processed foods are making us fat, even if the calories stay low. The term ""pre-digested"" comes up a lot and basically, stuff is already broken down too much for the body to actually use in normal processes, so it just gets stored as fat. I've cut a lot of breads, pastas and pre-packaged meals/meats out of my diet. 

ALCOHOL  
Talking about empty calories...   
I'm no prude, I'll still drink, but you can chose alcohols that are lower calorie/lower sugar content. My last roommate was all about the rum, and they didn't understand why they couldn't lose weight or kept gaining. Rum is one of the highest sugar alcohols out there. I think tequila and vodka are the lowest? I might have to do research on that again, but the vodka soda drinks are not too bad and maybe 100 to 120 calories a can and don't generally put me over my calorie consumption limit if I've been healthy that day. 

How am I doing?  
I get, overall, 20 hours of activity a week, and most of that is at my job. I walk a lot. It gets easier the more you do it. My knees and hips felt better even after the first 10lbs.   
I consume a lot of fresh veggies, fruits, and unprocessed meat, mostly chicken. Beef has become so darn expensive anyway.   
I have learned to make my own salad dressing in order to avoid added sugars. My favourite is dijon mustard, mayo, red wine vinegar, and crushed garlic. A little bit goes a long way on a good salad.   
I give myself cheat days and allow myself some little treats every day, because I know if I don't I'm going to binge until I'm sick and then vomit because I can't hold that much food inside me anymore and it makes everything feel awful and guilty. Don't abuse yourself just to lose weight and ""look pretty."" It's about feeling good in your own body. 

My clothes are looser. I move better. My back, hips and knees are feeling better. I can sit with my legs up a lot more comfortably. My apetite had decreased and normal portion sizes fill me up, even to the point of actually FEELING FULL, not just ""no longer hungry."" My hair, skin and nails have gotten healthier with the diet changes as well. I have to use fewer products to fix repairs now. I'd expect I would sleep better too if I hadn't been dealing with sleep issues since I was 8, but that'll be different for others. My balance is better. 

One Con:  
I'm cold all the time now lol   
No longer do I have the nice thick layer of blubber to keep the chill out. I actually have to put on socks and a long sleaved shirt sometimes now lol 

I'm still planning on losing about another 20lbs, but any lower than that I start looking TOO skinny. Again, bone density and breast size are a factor, and I know that the BMI is going to be skewed a fair bit because of that. Also, muscle weighs more than fat and once I start muscling up again from warm weather activities, that is going to put off the calculations as well. Remember, there are a lot of body builders out there who's BMI factors them as overweight or even OBESE!!! Don't let math tell you you're wrong, when what you see in the mirror finally looks right. I'm happy with the entire rest of my body aside from the bit of belly fat I still have left. 

I know this was super long, but I'm hoping that it can help give others some motivation, some hope, and maybe some helpful tips for success in their own weight loss journeys. Don't crash! Gracefully descend. It lasts longer. :)

Concern:
At 10:30am I had a feeling in my chest that felt like an electrical shock (on a pain scale of 1-10 it felt like a 4 it was painful enough to disturb my vision for a second I think my vision went black but am not entirely sure but I am sure that I did not loose consciousness). The electrical shock sensation started in the center of my chest, shoot out horizontally to both arms and traveled down to my elbows. The incident lasted for about 5 seconds. Afterwards my only symptom was a very mild soreness in my left arm where the electrical shock sensation traveled. By 10:40am I felt completely normal with no reportable symptoms such as but not limited to discomfort, pain, soreness or dizziness. Could indigestion cause such a sensation? This is not a sensation I have experienced before. ",1,1738090113.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Every single cashier has heard these jokes and they're not funny. Personally I find them irritating and it shows that you've never worked in retail before if you make the jokes. 

Also do you think we've never seen the price of the items before? It's not like we all come to work and stand behind the till wondering what price the coffee is gonna be today. We see the price increases, in fact we tend to see it before customers do depending on where you work. 

The jokes aren't funny and you yelling at us for the price of items (especially fuel) isn't gonna change anything. At the end of the day it makes you seem like the idiot. ",29,1738090103.0,unpopularopinion,84,0.66,False

I, 23 F, have been working at a bar in my area as a waitress for over 3 years. In my 3+ years there I have been hit on many times, I'm blonde and super flirty sometimes for the tips, but I never took anyones number. Once about a year in, I left my number for someone but it didn't pan out and that's when I decided officially no cross mingling. I have also had absolutely awful dating experiences in the past 3 years (Im talking abusive and BAD). Back in July of 2024 I had a total of 3 shifts serving, one Wednesday and two Thursdays in the span of two weeks, I had changed my availability so technically those days I shouldn't have been booked but it hadn't kicked in yet so the days I had booked off just didn't line up and I had to go in (that's what I get for trying to finesse a whole month off lol). On the second shift of the month I served a guy, lets call him A. A came in with two friends of his who work for him and I thought A was super cute (think Miles Teller but with a very kind smile). We chatted a little when his workers/friends stepped outside for smokes, I noticed him more than I normally did of customers, but they ended up just eating and leaving after joking around with me a little.

  


The next week I only worked one shift and I was sooooo close to giving it away but I realized I kind of do need to pay rent so I went in lol. Lo and behold, with me serving on the opposite side of the restaurant as the previous week, A and his friends come in again-and get sat in my section AGAIN. Huge coincidence and I am super happy, chatting and joking with A (kind of ignoring his friends but they didn't seem to care lol), but I have my rule of not co-mingling with customers so after they pay they leave and I pout a little bit missing my Miles Teller looking guy before walking over to clean and reset their table. At my restaurant on the dining side (which is where I am located on this particular day) we have paper and crayons on the table, and right beside where my name is on the table paper I see a name and a number written down. I take three pictures to make sure I save it to my phone before clearing the table. I am a giddy, smiley, sloppy, mess for the rest of the night just debating on if I should message him (in our conversations I learned they live 4 hours away from where I live and were just in town for work and that was their last night in my city), but I am incredibly single so I say F it - lets message him. So when I get home from work I message him, and by the next day we are texting. Over the weekend we chat a fair deal and he is as genuine, funny, and kind as he seemed. He tells me how he has never left a number for a waitress and I tell him how I have never taken a number left for me before so it's both our firsts lol. On the Sunday he says he is in town the following Tuesday for work and asks if I would be up for dinner, I obviously am ECSTATIC but play it cool and say sure (I had by coincidence had that day booked off or else I 100% would have been working).

  


Tuesday we meet at the restaurant and we just immediately mesh together, we talk for hours until he feels bad for how long we had sat at a booth taking up a servers table and we move to the bar to have drinks (he is the most polite to wait staff-huge green flag). After the bar we just keep talking and driving around for hours, kissing a little, but mostly getting to know each other. That weekend I drive up to his town to see him and by the middle of August we are inseparable. He is caring, giving, kind, treats me like a princess, and I know I'm a goner. I admittedly am freaking out because I've never been treated so good so I try and self sabotage by making him talk about serious topics early on to ""make sure we match"" but he is down for the convo and we DO match (jokes on me). So when he asked me to be his girlfriend I had no other choice than to say yes because he is someone who radiates love, happiness, and joy and I would be a fool to let him go. And when we were laying under a blanket of stars at his family's cottage and he told me he loved me, I had no other choice than to say it back-he had given me no choice but to fall in love with him, he's genuinely incredible. He brings me coffee in bed, surprises me with treats, always insists on buying me food, makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world when I have never felt like that before. He holds me when I cry and I know with him I am safe. I hope every day I get to watch him become everything he wants to be because I want to support him for the rest of my life, the way I know he will support me for the rest of mine.

  


So now, every week I drive 4 hours each way to go visit him, and I listen to Two Hot Takes to keep me company every drive. So thank you reddit and thank you Morgan for making my driving for my medium-distance relationship a little less lonely. Though I would drive to him in total silence, or in ear piercing noise-but this podcast does make the drive go by a lot faster.",0,1738089979.0,TwoHotTakes,0,0.17,False

1ic8sg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1ic8sg5/the_providers_chapter_1_nate/,The Providers - Chapter 1: Nate,"**Chapter 1 of my literary fiction novel:**

  
Nate awakens. Showers. Puts on his face cream, tucks in his ironed blue shirt. He grabs a coffee from his machine, walks to his balcony and lights his first cigarette of the day. He watches the sun rise from his regular spot, filling in the numbers of his Sudoku. He ashes his cigarette, making sure not to impact his half smoked joint from the Sunday night. He wants it in good order for tonight. He walks down all four flights of stairs, gets into his Ford, and drives to work for another week.



It is the exact same Monday as any Monday. He shares a wide grinned smile and happy hello to Gina at the front desk. They share the standard weekend small talk. She shares her daughters enjoyment of her third birthday party over the weekend with the same glee she always speaks to Nate in. He says hello to Henry, the closest to the door, and then boots up his PC and his cubicalBloombergterminal. He is the first one in his shared cubical today. Not rare enough to raise any alarm bells. But not common enough for him to do his regular greetings in order. He sees the headlines from the day, and which earning reports are due this week, heads to make his coffee and meets Larry in the kitchen brewing his tea. They head outside and share pleasantries over their cigarettes and caffeine.



Nate and Larry go over the plan for the week outside, with Nate stating that he is preparing end of quarter reports for all his clients, but with no leads for new work expected. Larry insists Nate push harder to pull in new clients. He says he will call some regular to see if he can throw any his way. Much the same as last week.



Nate forgets to ask Larry how his wife is doing. Or rather, he doesn‚Äôt summon the question to ask. Having just suffered a late stage miscarriage, and Nate witnessing the glee of Larry drain from his eyes during this time, it is a question Nate has avoided. He reminisces to himself of when he first started. Making Larry‚Äôs tea himself and being too scared to come outside for the cigarette with Larry. Being too scared to even smoke on office hours. This was despite Larry‚Äôs constant lighthearted humor taking place in every conversation. Guards were often dropped at drinks on Friday, which allowed Nate to build the mentor and apprentice bond he did. Nate was always grateful for Larry for taking a chance on a college dropout. Whilst thinking this, Nate realizes he is staring blankly at his screen. He quickly starts typing, ensuring he doesn‚Äôt hear a reprimand for mucking about.



The morning moves on. Nate updates the balance sheets of a few of his clients, and then gets on the phone. He calls his regulars. Personal tax advisors, accountants, etc. The regulars who sometimes have a new client to throw his way. He meticulously goes through his book for each regular. Enjoying he has the right sports team results to discuss, child to ask for, or whether they were able to get their Porsche out over the weekend. Its formulaic. No leads come from it, but he doesn‚Äôt expect any to. He makes the call so if something comes up during the week, he is the first person they think of.



He has an early afternoon Zoom meeting with a new client, looking to setup trusts for their two daughters. He goes through the regular questions,

‚ÄúIncome?‚Äù

‚ÄúTotal Assets currently?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much do you want to put in now, and regularly?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat risk profile are you looking for?‚Äù



He goes through the tick box exercise. With ¬£7.6mmcoming in, it would be lucrative for his fees and bonuses. Yet it remains a standard cookie cutter approach following the 80/20 rule. A rule he has followed time and time again. Whilst the idea of the additional fees excites him, it does nothing for him compared to his first few clients. He doesn‚Äôt bother taking notes during the meeting like he used to, using the transcript for all the important information.

The excitement he felt at first putting together financial plans exhilarated him. When people asked if he enjoyed his job, he used to answer ‚ÄúI love it‚Äù with undeniable passion that people envied him. Now, when he asked, he answers exactly the same way. But now it is part of his rehearsed script, rather than genuine love. Part of why he loved it was his gratitude for simply having a job. Having dropped out of college due to a combination of terrible marks and limited finances, he was happy to pick up anything. He loved piecing the puzzles of their plans and structure together. It was a hobby he always enjoyed. But years of the repetitiveness had added grayness behind the mask of his still sparkling eyes.



The markets closed, and before packing up, he decides to have a look at his own portfolio. This was not a habit he liked did often. But today he glanced and felt the humbleness of how short he was still from where he wanted to go. He contemplated greater risk, however that would be the third time he had done so in a short period, and he felt he‚Äôd rather stick to the basics this time.



He finished his thoughts, packed up and prepared to leave, and just before he left the desk his phone rang.

‚ÄúWhat do I owe the pleasure of speaking to you twice in one day?‚Äù he answered.ÔªøÔªøIt was from an accountant, James, whom he had spoken to in the morning. He heard of a potential client. But not exactly one filled with fees and bonus checks. James explained, bordering on pleading, how this is irregular, but the client is a personal friend. Someone he called ‚Äúa special human being.‚Äù And he is worried he is completely broke. The client had called James today, asking if there was anywhere he didn‚Äôt know he could find money. James believed the loan machine of the bank may have run dry. Nate got the sense he wasn‚Äôt hearing the full story. Possibly, because James did not know the full story. Possibly, because James was holding back. James knew this wasn‚Äôt the type of client Nate, or anyone else in his position would take on. There must be a reason he was calling, and Nate knew it was a favor more than a job.



Despite this, Nate felt a sense of excitement. He did not know why. Maybe to perhaps actually make a difference to someones life. Or maybe just because it sounded like a slightly more interesting puzzle than he had gotten used to. Either way he was happy to help. He asked James to send some information over, and he would look over it in the morning.



With that, Nate drove home, through his back to the floor, and walked to the balcony. He lit the joint that was still balanced on the outer crevices of his glass ashtray enjoying the last few hours of sunlight, before switching off.",0,1738089788.0,KeepWriting,1,0.5,False

It tastes a lot more like sugar cane juice than brown sugar or turbinado, adding some acidity/fruitiness in comparison. Usually drink my coffee black, but this has added some nice variety to my mornings. I started making the following recipe with a med-dark roast but I've switched to a light roast and, unexpectedly, I still really like it. The flavor of the piloncillo seems to make darker roasts taste lighter, but also helps bring out the fruitiness of a lighter roast.

Recipe - 200:13g, 5-7g of piloncillo,15-25g of heavy cream.

I use a serrated knife to shave off the sugar from the cone, but it would probably be much easier to make a rich simple syrup with it. 200:13 is what I use for a normal cup of black coffee, but I think it would taste even better with a stronger ratio of coffee to water.

I'm a high school senior who has been recently accepted to RIT. I'm planning to pursue a master's in computer science, along with an associate's or bachelor's degree in cybersecurity. I don't mind being in upstate New York, but I have a few concerns and questions:

1. **Stores and Amenities**: How are the stores around RIT? Are there enough options for daily needs/ shopping wants?
2. **Computer Science Program**: How strong is the computer science program at RIT? Especially, the dual degree programs for computer science. 
3. **Coffee Access**: I love drinking Starbucks/Dunkin' every morning. Will I have easy access to these coffee shops on or near campus if I have a car? 
4. **Esports Program**: How is the esports program at RIT? Are there kind people in the club?
5. **Dorms**: Are the dorms a reasonable size? Do students have personal bathrooms, or are they shared?
6. **Environment**: What is the overall environment like at RIT? My mom claims Rochester is a bad area, however she has never been to RIT's location. 
7. **ROTC National Guard**: I am also in the ROTC National Guard. How is the experience for students who are in ROTC at RIT?",1,1738088904.0,rit,5,1.0,False

For background, I‚Äôve been with my husband for 10 years and married for 3. We have a 1 year old and prior to having a baby we got along with his parents just fine, we weren‚Äôt overly close with them but we would visit once and a while and see them for holidays and it was always pleasant.  Once i became pregnant I saw this new controlling side to them. I‚Äôll break down some of the events that have happened. 

Pregnancy:
- we told them and my parents early when we found out and asked them to keep it a secret until we were ready to announce.  We wanted to wait until at least the second trimester and once we reached that we weren‚Äôt in a huge rush and were going to let people know on our own time. His parents asked every day before I was 12 weeks if they could tel people yet. One time they were heading to a family party we couldn‚Äôt make it to and called to ask if they could announce it. We repeatedly told them no that WE would announce it when we‚Äôre ready to. 
- wrote me a 10 page document typed about pregnancy advice, how to make a baby shower registry, items we needed, where to even get my maternity bras. It also included directions to the hospital and where to park and what doors to enter. Insane thing to give two fully capable adults in their 30s who have never asked for their advice before. However we just let it go and threw it out. 
- offered to buy the crib and mattress for our baby shower gift, we were thankful and let them know we had been researching what we want and can let them know. They sent us an email with 4 options and said our choice of a 4-in-1 crib was ‚Äúnonsensical‚Äù. The options they chose were similar in price so it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt want to spend the amount we picked out. We held our ground and said we would go with the one we want. We also did research on mattresses and picked one that had top safety ratings and let them know, but my husband stopped by their house after work one day and they had a totally different mattress there and when he told them that‚Äôs not what we want his mom had a hissy fit and said ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt even choose a mattress now‚Äù. 
- my mom was throwing the baby shower but she really wanted to throw one for her side so we decided to do two since both sides at my moms would be a lot. We told both sets of parents we just want a low key backyard get together, both genders, no presents being opened, and some family and a few friends. She sent out invitation without checking with us with my last name as their family name (I didn‚Äôt change my name when we got married) and only invited women in her family and none of our friends. My husband called to inquire what happened and his father told him the men go to the bar instead- like no that‚Äôs not what we want. So we told them my husband will be there and the men in the family are invited to- at this point I didn‚Äôt even want friends there, they could just come to my moms only. She also fought with us about not opening gifts every day planning the shower up until the day. 

The baby shower:
- only women in the family showed up and most expressed they didn‚Äôt know men were invited 
- it was incredibly awkward because the gift table was in the center of the party and she kept mentioning how ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not allowed to say anything about opening gifts‚Äù and her sisters kept getting children at the party to come ask me to open gifts. I absolutely refused out of principle. 
- served sushi and sandwich meat. At a fucking baby shower. I had a bun. 
- his aunt bombarded me when I came out of the washroom telling me she was so disappointed I didn‚Äôt open her gift. I told her my husband can open it then. He did. It was a homemade blanket that I ended up donating because it had such bad memories attached to it. I cried on the way home. 

Post partum- 
- came to meet the baby the next day after we got home, we asked them to wash hands and they claimed they already did even though they drove over and just got in our house and didn‚Äôt. This is a reoccurring thing that happened constantly during the newborn phase 
- immediately said baby looks exactly like my husband, i agreed I see similarities and then I showed a picture of me as a newborn that also looks has similarities and my FIL laughed and said ‚Äúare you trying to make yourself feel better‚Äù. This is ongoing where they are obsessed with my son looking like only their family and nothing like me. And will never stop talking about it. Even features that do look like me I can never bring up because it makes me feel almost pathetic for reaching after I was shut down like that. 
- when I had to breastfeed during the first visit they were already there for a while and they should have just left. We hinted it and his dad said no, some game on tv he wasn‚Äôt even paying attention to is in overtime so I had to hobble upstairs with stitches while wearing a diaper. 
- subsequent visits became even worse- every time I held my baby they would say ‚Äúit‚Äôs grandma/grandpas turn‚Äù almost within 30 seconds of me holding my baby 
- every ask we had they were offended by- like don‚Äôt pass hot coffee over the baby (‚ÄúIM NOT GOING TO DROP IT‚Äù) don‚Äôt pick up my baby and walk over to the open bbq to cook (‚ÄúI WONT DROP HIM‚Äù) and so much more. If we ever said don‚Äôt do something my FIL would on purpose continue to do it as an act of defiance. Like one time when baby was a couple months old and couldn‚Äôt hold his head up he held him to stand on his lap. We all said not to do that and he wouldn‚Äôt stop until we just took the baby way.  There‚Äôs a million little examples. 

The 1st birthday party: 
- I asked months in advance if a weekend worked for everyone for his bday party. It was a week before his actual bday. They said yes it works. 
- the week of the party they let us know they would like us to plan a dinner for them the same weekend because it‚Äôs their anniversary and it‚Äôs a special weekend for them. We have never celebrated their anniversary together and didn‚Äôt know the date.  We accused them of attempting to hijack our babies bday party and instead we can just get together with my family for his party and do their anniversary the next day since it‚Äôs their special day. 
- they got angry and said to forget about the dinner and they‚Äôll come to the party. So fine, I actually got them a gift card to a nice restaurant that I was going to give them after the party anyways which I thought was more than I needed to do for their anniversary. 
- at the party, they were totally overwhelming to our son. Following him around and always in his face and trying to pick him up. He just
Learned to walk so he wants to be on the ground. He also is trying to play with his cousins that are all on my side of the family. At one point my FIL brings him over to a balloon display and hands my son a balloon. I politely take it away and tell my FIL it‚Äôs a big choking hazard.  
- Balloon incident: my FIL questions me for like 5 minutes on why he can‚Äôt play with balloons, saying other kids were (who are older) and how he wouldn‚Äôt let anything bad happen to my son. I tel him well I‚Äôm not the other kids mother, I don‚Äôt want my child playing with a balloon. He puts everything in his mouth and even if you‚Äôre watching it can happen in a split second so it‚Äôs a no. He puts his hands around my neck to ‚Äújokingly‚Äù choke me and then walks away. I‚Äôm standing there shocked. I take my son and just walk away and try to forget it. My husband then comes up to me to tel me his dad has been mocking the balloon rule to my grandma and our friends. His dad is still going on about it and my husband says ‚Äúdad enough about the balloons- whether you agree or not we don‚Äôt care- just say okay and respect it‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not loud enough that anyone notices. His mother then makes a scene and shouts ‚Äúit‚Äôs clear you hate us! Do not speak to us that way!‚Äù  Room goes quiet. It‚Äôs awkward. They leave. We keep the gift card lol. 
- they call us the next day to ‚Äúapologize‚Äù and say she behaved that way because they are upset about their anniversary and his dad said he doesn‚Äôt like when we tell him what to do because he feels we don‚Äôt trust him. So it was a sorry but it‚Äôs your fault kinda apology. 


Since they are the type of people who just sweep things under the rug they act like nothing has happened when we see them. I can‚Äôt be like that so I have a hard time seeing them. Instead I just avoid them as much as I can now. They invited us over next week and a few weeks after that it‚Äôs their bday and want to go for dinner. I just gave so much anxiety about seeing them and want to not go but I also don‚Äôt want my son around them without me. My husband is good about upholding boundaries, even more so than me but they push more if I‚Äôm not there. I don‚Äôt want to be accused of withholding their grandchild from them but i just am over feeling anxious every time they are around. ",47,1738088858.0,JUSTNOMIL,20,0.96,False

So it started off with me (f23) having a crush on a guy (m24) that I have a course with at uni.
This was the end of October.


-Backstory (can be skipped)-

We‚Äòve interacted frequently since September bc we have mutual friends and saw eachother twice a week due to the course.
I didn‚Äôt think abt him much at first, but one day we ran into each other randomly an hour before our course. 
 We  decided to hang out until our course started and BOOM I started crushing hard. 
He was just so nice to talk to, I‚Äôd already admired the way he carried himself and the way he just had an insane amount of knowledge, but hanging out with him I found out he was funny and interesting too. (And lowkey hot lmao)

However, the next time we talked it was sort of awkward, maybe bc I was nervous.
 But that awkwardness never quite went away. Still, I invited him to study at a cafe with me twice.

At this point I thought he had no interest in me whatsoever. He never seemed to wanna see me or talk to me longer than necessary (except for walking me home sometimes).

 The third time we studied together I invited him over to watch a film her wanted to see, since I have Netflix and he doesn‚Äôt .

Long story short, we started hooking up and spending the night at each others places but agreed to not tell our mutual friends.
Furthermore we‚Äôd never text abt meeting up , when it would happen it was spontaneous. 
About two weeks into this, I noticed he didn‚Äôt rly ever ask me questions.
 I didn‚Äôt notice at first bc I enjoyed hearing him chat but it made me feel like maybe he didn‚Äôt like me that much.
Though he‚Äòs like with everyone including his friends.
He also would do things like buy me coffee, remember the kinds of necklaces I wear and flirt.
However he also he started talking abt the things he‚Äòd done for other girls he used to date.
Which also felt shitty bc he wasn‚Äôt even bothered enough to text me abt hanging out.

-Backstory end-


To summarize: we started hooking up late October and though I really liked him I felt like he didn‚Äôt like me as a person.
Even though there always were small moments that made me think maybe he didn‚Äôt like me or even that he reciprocated my feelings.
Especially since he is fairly closed off abt his emotions with everyone.
I didn‚Äôt have an issue with being casual or not going beyond being fwb. 
My issue was more that I actually wanted the friendship part as well, not just the 
Benefits  part. 

During winter break we both went back to our home towns and I didn‚Äôt hear from him at all. After we got back, I didn‚Äôt hear from him either.
A week after getting back, we ran into each other grocery shopping and ended up hooking up again.

The next time we saw each other after that he was really cold and I thought that was that. Like I fully thought we were just gonna ghost each other.

Fast forward two weeks, we run into each other again and he apologizes for the last interaction and asks me to come over.

I do, thinking maybe we‚Äòll officially end this now and I‚Äôll get peace of mind. 
But that doesn‚Äôt happen. We don‚Äôt hook up either, instead we just hang out and talk, like friends.

I still have a crush on him. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I should probably talkt o him but I‚Äôm honestly too scared to. So I‚Äôm asking ‚ú®strangers on the internet‚ú®:

Should I just try being friends without benefits him? Does he even like me?? If so in what way?? Or should I ghost him?? Are we even still fwb? Or is that over??

1ic8d7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1ic8d7j/alcohol/,Alcohol,"Why Alcohol is Not for Leaders: A Personal Reflection

As someone who has navigated the complexities of leadership in various capacities, I want to share an insight that has become increasingly clear to me over the years: alcohol is not for leaders. This revelation didn't come from reading self-help books or hearing motivational speakers; it came from my own experiences and observations in both professional and personal spheres.

I remember the first few times I sipped a drink at networking events. It felt like a rite of passage, a way to connect with colleagues and peers. But soon, I began to realize that alcohol can create a false sense of camaraderie. In a professional setting, where decisions must be made with clarity and responsibility, inhibiting our judgment is rarely a wise choice. I have witnessed leaders who indulged a bit too much, only to find themselves waking up to the regret of hastily made decisions or, worse, irreparable damage to their professional relationships.

Leadership, by its very nature, demands clarity of thought, fortitude, and the ability to inspire trust. When a leader is under the influence of alcohol, even the most skilled communicator can falter. Important conversations may go awry, intentions can be misconstrued, and the respect that others have for you can dissipate in an instant. 

Moreover, I‚Äôve seen the impact of alcohol beyond the individual. It creates a culture that can normalize excessive drinking and diminish accountability. As a leader, I believe we have a responsibility to set an example. When I choose to abstain from alcohol, I find that I can engage more meaningfully with others, offer support when needed, and maintain an environment of professionalism and respect.

Alcohol may seem like a social lubricant, but it can be an emotional crutch that masks deeper issues within teams or workplaces. I‚Äôve also found that when people see their leaders embracing sobriety, it opens the door for honest conversations about mental health and well-being. It encourages others to feel safe in their own choices and fosters a culture of authenticity. 

I‚Äôve learned that there are countless ways to bond with colleagues and celebrate achievements without reaching for a drink. Whether it's hosting a coffee chat, organizing team-building activities, or simply enjoying a walk to discuss ideas, these moments can be just as enriching‚Äîif not more so‚Äîthan any happy hour.

In conclusion, leadership is a privilege that comes with the responsibility to act wisely, inspire those around us, and foster a culture that promotes well-being and productivity. For me, choosing to step away from alcohol has been a personal commitment to embody these values and encourage others to do the same. As leaders, let‚Äôs recognize our influence and choose paths that empower us and those we lead. After all, the greatest legacy we can create is one of integrity and respect‚Äîa legacy that we can build with clear minds and open hearts.",1,1738088757.0,alcoholism,1,0.67,False

So the first step is breaking through the detached bubble of the people in your REAL life, in your REAL vicinity (not just your online community, who would have to prioritize their own physical safety and vicinity if shit we‚Äôre to actually hit the fan in the next couple of years). 

Here are some of my ideas so far for creating a community in an area without one:

- starting a spiritual meetup group, where you meet in a coffee shop / free space and talk about spiritual things (I‚Äôve had some success with this one)

- starting a group specifically asking for volunteers to help with a project in your local community (community garden, trash cleanup, volunteering time to homeless shelters or places that already exist and need assistance)

- hosting a free neighborhood event (potluck, New Year‚Äôs vision board party, etc.)

- inviting people to your home for holidays (even for minor ones like Valentine‚Äôs Day) and feeding them good food, trying to facilitate an enjoyable time

- attending local political meetings

The only problem is I don't know how to decorate or what colors to use in order to complement the floors. 

DISCLAIMER: none of the furniture and decor belongs to us, it all belongs to the sellers.

I think the layout the sellers have is nice, and we‚Äôll probably do the same layout. My husband and I have a sectional as well, but we do not want a sectional anymore. We don't know what color to get the new couches in to complement the floors. We also plan on getting an area rug, but we are also unsure of the colors we should get. Also what finish/paint color would you recommend we get our coffee tables and other furniture in?

We do not want to paint the walls at this time, but possibly in the future, any color recommendations?

Also, we have a 7 month old son and we plan on expanding our family in the years to come, so any recommendations of colors and materials for couches that won't stain easily and won't show wear and tear quickly, are greatly appreciated!",0,1738088477.0,interiordecorating,5,0.5,False

Maybe it's a cold rainy day and I burst into a coffee shop, soaking wet and shivering. I take a few seconds for myself to catch my breath before heading in. I'm immediately blasted by the warm air and the scent of coffee and flour, hearing the chit chats of the people and seeing the warm yellow tone glow of the lights. I glance around and noticed it's fairly empty today, my eyes scan the room until they land on the barista. A woman who appears to be my age, slightly smiling but visibly tired from a long day. She seems to be deep in thought at the current moment, her mind racing with dances and dreams, just like mine. As I approach the counter she looks up and smirks, observing my distaper of an appearance, saying ""that bad outside huh"". I chuckle lightly and say sarcasticslly ""oh this is nothing, just you wait till April, that's really when the floods really start."" She's knows I'm joking and tells me her name. I say mine and we exchange a few more sentences. Eventually she asked if I'd like to order anything, I nod and order a hot chocolate. She claims thats and unusual order, i chuckle again and shrug it off, participing in her banter.

Then I'll go find a seat, maybe near the fireplace, or an empty table, I'll crack out my laptop and start typing away. Crafting countless stories in my head, imagine worlds where anything can happen. I keep at that until my names called and my drink is handed off to me with a warm smile from that barista before.

I keep tryping and imagining until someone comes up to me. It's her again. She says she's on a break and asks if she can sit with me. I, of course, agree. We then sit, talking nonstop for 15 minutes that feels like a lifetime. She tells me the cafe is closing soon and if I wait around until then we could go explore this quite little town. I say ""that'd be lovely, although we might have to wait for the rain to slow down."" She smiles and says ""there's nothing wrong with getting a little wet.""

And before I know it I'm dragged outside in the pouring rain, my hand in hers, running away from the world. We run through the streets, laughing with tears forming in our eyes from the rain and winds. It's darker now, as we race by the town we see the flashes and streaks of the fairy lights strung around. She looks gorgeous. Even with the rain and wind crashing against her face. I see in her eyes she feels the same about me. I hear a sting from a violin and turn my head around, seeing a live band playing for a festival. The event is covered by a crowded tent with glass windows, separating the rain from the party. We glace to each other and rush over as fast as we can. We crash through the doors and take a beat to shake the rain away. The music swells in a gracious score and we rush twords the from to dance. I take the lead with a waltz and she follows suit. seeming shocked but catching on quickly and laughing nonstop. The music fades and time slows down, I'm no longer wet and cold. I'm looking into her eyes as she looks at mine. Observing every little thing about her. Her hair, her eyes, her lips. Every little thing, important and not. I look inside myself and find feel...Home.

we dance for hours until we can barely breath, we collaps on a table and catch our breath. A bartender comes over and asks for our orders. We look at each other again and laugh, I order a sherley temple, and she, a coffee, surprisingly enough. The bartender's confused by our outlandish choices of beverages, but we don't care. We drink, and laugh, and talk, until we collapse from exhaustion.

We make our way back to the cafe, and stand beside our cars. We exchange somewhat silly goodbyes and as the conversation dies, we stare at each other. Her shining green eyes are the only thing I see. We take a beat before leaning forward towards each other. Then we kiss. A magical, remarkable, interstellar kiss. One in which time stops forever and we float off the ground. I've got the goofiest smile on my face and she has her intense stare of affection. We laught again and part ways for the night.

On the drive home in made entity of happiness. Smiling non stop like a moron and wishing I could be next to her again.

I get back home and as I'm laying in bed, I'm open my messenger app. I text her something stupid and she replied instantly. We then proceeded to text for hours on end. Talking about everything and nothing at all. We then start to meet everyday, spend every moment we can with eachother. Learning, growing, laughing, playing, working, living, and loving. We have just started out journey of building the most magical life two people could have on this planet. Full of love and affection and anything anybody could ever want.

We did it. We took the world by storm and did the impossible. We found each other amongst an endless see of souls, drawn together by the stars. Happier than the meaning of the word. Never alone again because we have eachother forever. My chest of warm and I'm glowing from inside and out, seratonin rushing through my brain, forever grateful for what I have.

1ic86xf,https://i.redd.it/grshetqy0sfe1.jpeg,Good Espresso from a Gaggia Classic,"I‚Äôm down the rabbit hole in an effort to get good coffee from my Gaggia Classic. And I see why my ex left it for me‚Ä¶

The machine has been disassembled and inspected, cleaned with cafiza, descaled, and reassembled. It has a thermometer installed against the boiler which allows temperature monitoring. It‚Äôs being fed Starbucks dark roast beans, weighed to 0.1g, ground with a new df54 grinder, tamped with a 58.4mm tamper in a single walled basket. Shots are timed and stopped by weight as measured with a scale.

Observations: 
1. Thermostats have a huge deadband. At least 10F. This crosses the spectrum from bitter to sour, in my experience with the machine so far. 
2. It takes the heater less than 10 seconds to bring the thermometer from 214 to 224F
3. It takes a few minutes to coast down from 224F to 214F

If I start a shot with the thermometer at 218F, it will just complete the shot without kicking on the heater. Taste is pretty good, but the intro shot temperature falls enough to introduce some sourness. This is with the portafilter preheated in the group head, and a ~3s hold of the steam switch just before firing the shot.

I‚Äôm considering some options to get good coffee:
1) a gaggiuno, probably gen 2. Hate adding a microcontroller to an otherwise mechanical device. 
2) PID control setup from shade coffee, along with pump dimmer control and pressure gauge
3) OPV spring swap to 9bar, and a momentary thermostat bypass switch along with thermometer on the boiler for manual ‚Äúoperator in the loop‚Äù temperature control. May need a dimmer control as well to attenuate heater power for better control of intra-shot temperatures

Has anyone tried #3 (manual heater control?) thoughts?

 My sweet 6 year old Husky / Pyr / Pit mix has become significantly more reactive in the past two years and it has been tough. We are learning to manage better, through conditioning, muzzle training, and just straight up not putting him into situations that will definitely not be positive but it's hard not to feel like I failed him somehow. I got him as a rescue when he was almost 1, no idea what his story was before that as he was found as a stray. He has always been a super sweet, cuddly, friendly guy but has become much more reactive to human strangers over time. This has included snapping in the direction of and one bite (did not puncture or draw blood) to a houseguest (of a roommate) whom he had already met before. We have had to move twice in the past two years, and it was after the first move that his shift in behavior became very apparent. The area we moved to had much more foot traffic outside (and inside, my roommate had a cat and people over a lot) than we were used to. I used to bring my dog to coffee shops, breweries etc with no problem but it we don't do that anymore since the last time he snapped at a barista (everyone he has snapped at has been male). Two months ago we moved into our own place with a yard and on a quiet side street, and overall things have been much better since, but we had another incident today in town (a snap, no contact, I should have used better judgment) and it's getting me down.

Before I continue, I looked up theta waves just now, and you can enter theta state by simply being in a relax state of mind, or in other words your comfort zone. 

So I think further proves my statement. 

The reason I said you must literally live your dreams, is I think the people who are successful actually literally mean that they are living their dreams, their reality is their daydream fantasies or wandering thoughts. 

They have goals set that take them closer to their fantasies, instead of simply dreaming or thinking of it. 

But I'm not still explaining myself well here. 

The other reason I stated all that I stated is I do think consciousness default state is a low consciousness dream like state. 

What I mean is, last night I was doing my best to be focused and disciplined and decided to turn off the games and music but my mind still wander to fantasies and  pointless thinking. 

Then I thought, why is that the case? 

And I said it because it's the default state of mind, to dream ---- lets actually further define what I mean by default state of mind, I think I'm trying to say the default state of mind is going back to REM sleep in a sense 

Which REM sleep, your brain mimics a wakeful state while asleep, it's the stage of sleep when you have vivid dreams and some people even act out their dreams during this stage 

REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement but for the sake of my point or argument I'm trying to describe, to you all, is that REM stands for Random Energy Movement. 

To be clear, undirected, thought. 

Anyways so I thought that it's because the default state is to dream, and it's why my mind wanders to fantasy. 

But I thought that didn't make sense completely because I'm only capable of thinking up fantasies the way that I do, due to language. 

And I tried to imagine this concept of default dream like state as a ancient human without language. 

And I don't think it was a coincidence or much of a surprise that heriogiyphs and cave paintings were a thing first. 

The other thing I did is I thought how like the cultivation of complex thinking and reasoning came to be, and the building blocks of it. 

By that I mean, being able to call a fellow being to you by yelling is very significant thing to do. 

And like I don't think animals lack intellectual capability because their communication with each other is very complex. 

We would be more equal or at the same level as wild, feral animals if we had no culture of knowledge or civilization. 

I'm going in circles 

But the other thing is, I don't think we are naturally able to think or behave rationally, and have a tendency to madness or irrationally. 

Even now, I know I'm not doing my best, and should change how I approach writing my paragraphs and should edit each paragraph and proof read and so on and it's actually needed for me to do that to counteract my REM lets say, my natural self 

But the reason I said we have a tendency to madness is it was only due to scientific method or thinking that we started to question the plausiblity of things, which is very recent. 

By that I mean modern humans are the same humans from 2000 years ago, the explosion of technology is due to our changes of understanding to the reality of things and how to manipulate it and apply our knowledge 

To hurry up to a conclusion, I'm saying we have to literally live our dreams out because if you are dreaming of doing 10 push ups, it means by default you are not living it. You are dreaming it.

In order to live out your dreams, you have to become what you dream about. 

So adjust your wandering mind to align closer to your feasible reality that is in your proximity of actionable action.

To start changing who you are and what you do. 

Even tho I'm saying all this, I'm not sure if I'm right, I bee trying to change myself all the time, the reason I'm posting this, is I feel very more in control of my mind and body with this perspective, and sentiment of thought. 

It is needed to organized your thinking, I overthink a lot and never do things quickly enough, and it's because I like to dream more than I like to live i think. 

To live is to face experiences head on and brace for impact. 

So a suggestion to get started well what I'm going to do, is keep my imagination and thoughts grounded. To what I know to be true about my objective reality instead of not. 

I'm actually going to avoid listening to music and playing games today, the only pleasure I will partake in is drinking coffee and learning, to increase my knowledge thus my awareness to things so I can overcome obstacles to have better sense of what to do next. 

I might give a update later if people are interested,

Ehh I am worried that I'm just going to go back to the same old me after a episode of high productivity but the reason I'm saying things will be different this time is I believe I identify why I go back to previous state and not stay as the me I'm trying to change too or become. 

And I think simply need to recognized I must keep a high consciousness state of mind, by that I mean, you may see yourself as conscious

 but like I said your brain was basically cultivated or nurtured to the state it is now without your intentional doing. 

And I'm saying start intentionally doing, start intentionally becoming, not trying/wishing but believe and do and become and change now. 

And I want to stress orderly thinking, let's say logic vs irrational logic or saying aimless wandering thinking or emotional thinking

Because orderly thinking is needed to direct one self, a dream is in orderly narrative fashion but was not directed by you, but by your REM sleep. 

And I'm saying in life your REM is controlling you, keeping you consciously aware, awake, aka in a low conscious state 

That seems complex because of how far the modern 
Human mind well brain was cultivated and nurtured by society etc. 

To further proof my point people with high self esteem are more successful too, and live out their dreams too, and high self esteem is simply meaning how you feel about yourself, 

So feel good well positive in your ability to change and do what you aim to do instead of not and get going to creating the life you want to lead and live. 

But again logical thinking is needed, but we are human and not logical creature by that I mean autistic people think a lot and so on but lack sensibilities to how humans are naturally 

And like I'm not sure what to do about that myself, for instance at my job, I notice I'm never going get promoted because of my personality and lack of people skills, some new guy who was here less than e is getting promoted to manager before me, when I was even told that I was going to be train to manager from a higher up, but it think the company is ignoring the higher up and training someone they have more confidence in or like more than me. 

Hmm I think there is reasonable thought and then there is logical thought inr regards to emotional matters vs objective matters. 

But IDK.

Sorry for rambling. But set a goal and do your all to achieve it today simply, and keep all I said in mind. 

EDIT: 

The other thing I want to add is dealing with negativity,

 so I just woke up, I had the idea for this post before I went to bed, and the second I woke up after pondering about all night. 

Was like the first thing I did was write this post to start my day off right.

And I was hit with something super negative just now, that is causing me to be irrational and just ""forget it"" I just going seek instant gratification to feel better. And I really want to numb the negativity the pain in feeling from what just happen to me. 

Basically my mom sent a text a screen shot for me to pay a $400 phone bill basically. I shouldn't be paying it. I'm not going to give full details. 

But my point is I can't let this negative energy or moment influence me or control me. 

I must stay the overarching influence 

And like Idk how to describe it but when your buttons are pushed you do somewhat have a go to emote or reaction. 

And I'm saying question you react to negative moments in your life. 

And do your best to cultivate a positive mindset and mental attitude that will help you succeed in life. 

So in regards to this negative thing in my life, I should not be passive about it, but confront my mom and be like"" why Is it that I have to help you pay a over price phone bill?""

But objectively speaking I want to stop paying it, or get someone else to pay it because I shouldn't have too, it's not that I shouldn't have too, but I really felt manipulated into this situation where I feel I have to pay her, but I didn't want this at all, and either way I want it and things in my life to change 


I'm thinking it might be easier to just not care, and act unfazed and just not waste any mental energy trying to figure out how to deal with things you don't want to deal with. But I do need to deal with it, but it's not a actually problem problem yet, but I want to be smart about it, but I more so want to be smart and focus about getting my life to where I want it to be and not dealing with this negative moment like my life depends or value depends on it if that makes sense. 

Bottomline I am getting taken advantage of and tired of it... But what should I do about it?  Is my point, but the point is not let influence me, sway me from goals I set and not have power my self esteem etc 

Actually it's smart to choose your battles, I can just do payment arrangements for now, so it won't be a huge blow to my paycheck but ehh

Technically I was ‚Äústealthed‚Äù - my company did 3 stealth rounds of layoffs in 3 months and then a publicly disclosed 10% layoff. 

I came home from my Sunday birthday dinner and was feeling chest pains so I went to the ER.  I saw an email from my manager copying another manager, subject line: Meeting and the body said ‚ÄúHi, I put a meeting on your calendar tomorrow for 9am.‚Äù and I knew it was coming.

8 reasons why it sucked:

(1) I was sleep deprived from being in the ER.  It was characterized as a performance termination.  My manager couldn‚Äôt even look me in the eyes, he just read off what he needed to say. The other manager looked down and shook his head the whole time and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs leverage all the connections we can‚Äù and scheduled coffee on Monday.  

(2) It was a termination with a 4 month garden leave.  They were like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll still have building privileges, you can still use your office and leverage the networks here‚Äù but in reality, my email access was cut off after 3 weeks and my manager even asked me if I was planning to come in because some people wanted to use my office.

(3) I still had to work for 1-2 weeks and many people would be like ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù and never open emails again but i didn‚Äôt want to burn bridges.  I was on several projects and it was so awkward having to still review work from junior staff and interact with clients.  I finally took the initiative and emailed clients informing them I was leaving before the manager could sent abrupt emails to the whole project team like ‚ÄúHi Client, [My name ] is no longer at the firm.  We have appreciated all that she/he has contributed to our organization.  Going forward, please copy [coworker] on all emails.‚Äù  Which of course meant I had 4 people calling and texting me like ‚Äúyou are leaving?!!‚Äù 

(4) There was built-in shame in the whole process.  Sure, I could have went door to door knocking and saying ‚ÄúHey Bill, not sure if you heard but my last day is coming up with the company.  I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed working with you and really hoping we can keep in touch‚Äù but unfortunately, the shame and confusion of it all was preventing me.  It felt like my only choice was to disappear quietly. 

(5) Prior to the layoff, we had an informal work trip planned to Vegas.  Everyone who has been laid off canceled their flights except me.  I still went and it was extremely awkward being around people who were saying there were rumors of layoffs, etc and it felt weird interacting with everyone and reading into who in the group knew I had been impacted and who didn‚Äôt.  I also realized at the pool how much weight I lost from all the stress. 

(6) HR is obviously not your friend.  The HR lady who was always so sweet to me would only respond to my emails if it was about the severance agreement.  Otherwise, she basically ignored my emails.  I had to find out my network access was cut off from the IT guys who were also so sweet to me and upset to tell me they were told to refer me to HR.  

(7) In professional services, having a gap on your resume feels like a death knell.  (It isn‚Äôt, but you don‚Äôt know any better if you‚Äôve never been terminated.)  so the job search during my garden leave which was October to January felt like hell because I‚Äôd get to final rounds and either they would go with someone more junior or more senior or would rescind the offer after I negotiated salary or would ghost me after the holidays. 

(8) It is hard leaving a job not on your own terms.  You don‚Äôt get to say goodbyes to people that mattered to you and saw you go from 30 to 35 personally and professionally, it is harder to network without a job (and unclear how to position yourself in those conversations), and you lose a huge network you have built over the years (i.e. they aren‚Äôt inviting terminated employees to alumni events) because of all the shame and awkwardness.  

Hope this is helping to anyone going through something similar.  You‚Äôll make it through.  I got 2 prescriptions for Lexapro but I never took any meds for anxiety and stress, I just moved through it and did 2 therapy sessions per day.  ",28,1738088156.0,Layoffs,4,1.0,False

At this point, using Cropster, it‚Äôs generated after each roast, based mostly on the area under the BT line, affected directly by heat application, total roast time, charge temperature and end temperature from what I can figure. 
From my experiments, I can make a fast roast, more aggressive with a certain RAI, or a Slow profile with the exact same end RaI. The fast one is a lot more soluble, bright and fruity, but I risk having roast defects, the slow one is less soluble,silky and sweet, but lacks intensity of flavour. 
Do you take this data in account? And if so, how do you use it in roasting a coffee?",1,1738087975.0,coffee_roasters,0,1.0,False
