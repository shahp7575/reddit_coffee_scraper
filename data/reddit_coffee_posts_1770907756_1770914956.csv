1r2yin7,https://i.redd.it/9mlogb4ue3jg1.jpeg,I built a tiny 3D game this morning while drinking coffee,"I was sitting in a bar, having breakfast, with my coffee and my croissant, and I wanted to try this random AI tool, kind of vibecoding style like Lovable but for games.

A few prompts later I had a colorful third-person game where a bouncing ball keeps jumping forward onto moving platforms that slide left and right, you try to land clean, miss and you fall into the void. Simple idea, but it works pretty well.

It started as a throwaway experiment but it’s actually fun.

The interface is smooth, controls are minimal, and it already feels like a real prototype.

Now I’m stuck thinking if this is a game monetizable in 2026, or is it just AI bs.

There are tons of SaaS and apps made with vibecoding + AI getting millions in funding, so why couldn’t the same thing happen with games?

Some ideas I had:

* mobile release with ads + unlockable skins (super simple)
* leaderboard arcade game
* short TikTok clips

I’m a social media manager so advertising this wouldn’t be hard, the only real problem is developing the game.

Am I overthinking this or do you think it’s actually doable? Obviously not in this version, since I spent like 15 minutes making what it is now. I’m just thinking: if I developed it in a slightly more structured way, would it make sense?

I have a Baratza grinder and I've noticed a wide range of optimal grind sizes across the different coffees I've purchased. Some I grind at 14 clicks, some at 20 clicks.

With a blend of say, 50% one origin 50% another, what comes to mind is that there may not be an optimal grind size for both beans, leading to half being over-extracted and half being under-extracted.

Does this effect happen and if yes, should I do something to mitigate it? Or should I generally avoid blends?

I had this thought after receiving a blend today where I can noticeably see some beans being much lighter and some much darker.

1r2ydup,https://i.redd.it/hd0r4csbe3jg1.png,Is the GoMining Visa card FX spread worth it? Real numbers + long-term miner perspective,"I wanted to share some real numbers from my own GoMining prepaid Visa card usage and explain why, even with visible FX slippage, this card can still make sense for miners.

I made two small purchases at Tim Hortons in Canada. One was $7.90 CAD and the other was $7.44 CAD. In both cases, the card deducted USDT instead of CAD. When I calculated the implied exchange rate, it came out to roughly 1.33 CAD per USD.

On those same days, the real market USD to CAD rate was closer to 1.36.

That means the card is effectively using a rate about 2% worse than spot. There’s no mystery fee shown anywhere — the cost is baked into the FX conversion. So yes, there is real slippage, and it’s fair to call it out.

However, looking at this card purely as a fiat spending tool misses the bigger picture for GoMining users.

This isn’t just a debit card. It’s part of a closed-loop mining ecosystem. When you spend with it, you’re converting mining-derived value into real-world purchases while staying inside the GoMining system. On top of that, you earn 2% cashback in TH, not fiat.

That distinction matters.

Unlike traditional cashback, TH doesn’t stop working after the transaction. It contributes to your total hashrate, produces BTC continuously, and benefits from long-term Bitcoin price appreciation. The coffee is gone in 10 minutes, but the hashpower earned from that purchase keeps producing.

So while you’re effectively paying about 2% through FX spread, you’re also earning productive hashrate that compounds over time. If you already believe in long-term BTC exposure and mining yield, that trade-off can make sense.

This card is not ideal for people chasing perfect FX rates or pure fiat efficiency. It is much more attractive for miners who want an easy way to spend mining value without fully off-ramping to banks and who value reinvesting into hashrate over short-term cash optimization.

In short: yes, there’s FX friction. But for GoMiners thinking long term, the card acts less like a debit card and more like a bridge between daily spending and ongoing mining rewards.",1,1770914603.0,gomining,0,1.0,False

There’s a stage of business where things are objectively working: revenue is moving, the team exists, customers are coming in, but the decisions start getting heavier.

Not tactical questions. Structural ones.

	•	“Is this the right direction for the next 3–5 years?”

	•	“Has the company outgrown the way I built it?”

	•	“Am I solving the right problems anymore?”

	•	“Why does success suddenly feel… noisy?”

Many owners have advisors. Some have boards. A lot have no real thinking partner at all.

Over the years working closely with founders and senior operators, I noticed something:

Smart leaders don’t struggle because they lack intelligence.

They struggle because they lack clean space to think at the level the business now requires.

So I recently opened a small number of spots for a structured 1:1 leadership engagement called The Strategic Reset, designed specifically for owners at inflection points.

It’s:

• Paid

• Time-boxed (45 days)

• Extremely problem-driven

• Built around strategic clarity and decision support

Not coaching. Not therapy. Not “let’s grab coffee and brainstorm.”

More like focused decision architecture for people carrying real weight.

Leaders typically walk away with:

• Clear strategic direction

• A personalized decision filter

• A 90-day execution roadmap

• Less cognitive noise

• More confidence in the moves ahead

So I’m curious:

👉 When you’re facing a truly consequential business decision, who do you think with?

👉 Or do you mostly carry it alone?

(And if you do have a process, I suspect a lot of owners here would benefit from hearing it.)

Summary: Even with all the training from Flins and the upgrades from Aino, Ineffa finds her battery capacity woefully lacking in terms of power.

 

They contact Lauma who contacts Columbina, who is undecided on which friend she should help.

 

Columbina goes to Sandrone’s workshop to grill her about why she is doing this, and Sandrone begins to unravel the truth...



===================================  


A week had passed since Aino’s disappearance.

 

“Hah! Urgh!”

 

The sounds of Ineffa and Flins’ training filled the yard, and it didn’t end after a few seconds like last time.

 

Flins could only marvel as the new Ineffa continued to take shape. She was a true masterpiece of Aino’s ingenious vision and Jahoda’s painstaking labor.

 

Her basic design remained the same, but her body was now noticably taller to accommodate the extra armor, now barely below his own height. She was also equipped with new motors so the added weight wouldn’t hinder her agility.

 

Yet nothing was comparable to her new mobility option – Powered Flight.

 

Taking inspiration from that one dragon from the Knights of Favonius (Durin, was it?), Ineffa’s cape was redesigned into an intricate pair of foldable metal wings attached to her body. They could be unfurled and powered by Birgitta, now attachable to her shoulder blades with an added jetpack function.

 

Much to Ineffa’s visible displeasure, it was not hard to see what kind of design Aino was going for: A fearsome robotic dragoness that would make any Fatui Harbinger think twice.

 

‘If only her timid attitude could match her aggressive looks...’ Flins thought, as he parried another misaimed blow.

 

Still overly uncertain about her nature, he was still winning spars that should be unwinnable with her new hardware. Yet his margins for victory were becoming ever slimmer. Perhaps even with this handicap, she would be able to defeat Sandrone after half a month of arduous training?

 

“Can’t... continue...” Ineffa’s weak, dusty voice crashed his train of thought.

 

She was staggering in front of him and supporting herself with her polearm, looking less a revered dragon and more a helpless chicken about to keel over.

 

“My deepest apologies, Ms. Ineffa. I did not know robots could also get tired. You rest here until I get some refreshments from the Craftshop.”

 

“Not... tired... power.... turning off...”

 

And she collapsed, leaving a startled Flins to hurry over to the Craftshop to find Jahoda the resident mechanic.

 

=============================

 

“Seriously, we can’t go on like this! Flins, give me ideas!”

 

Jahoda was pacing about the craftshop, totally not panicking. Ineffa was in the recharging bed, but this was already the fourth time she had suffered power outages this week.

 

“I must apologize, I hardly have your erudition or your expertise when it comes to mechanical matters. Though she seemed to keep up with all my combat training last week without much issue. What changed?”

 

That aristocratic, polite and nonchalant attitude only drove her further up the wall.

 

“A lot more weight, and high–powered motors, what do you think happened?!”

 

“Perhaps... battery problems?” “Bingo!”

 

She finally stopped pacing, and sat down to cover her face with her two hands.

 

“Ugh, this is just embarrassing... both me and Aino were way too caught up in making Ineffa look cool and fight well that we completely forgot about the logistics... but honestly, what can we do? It’s not as if we can afford to go back to low-strength motors! Pulonia would just crush her!”

 

Jahoda saw Flins cradle his arms, rocking back and forth, deep in thought. Then, he clapped once and suddenly rose from his seat. Maybe he had a good idea?

 

“Miss Aino is a profound genius of the century, surely she can pull a Dottore and design another artificial moon for infinite Kuuvahki?”

 

‘Note taken. When you demand engineering ideas from a luddite like Flins, apparently he asks to pull moons out of your arse. Besides, after what happened last time, Columbina would be absolutely livid-’

 

Wait.

 

A spark of genius, or perhaps madness struck her sleep-addled brain. The Moon Maiden. Pull a moon out of her arse.

 

“Flins, I am about to suggest something very, very stupid that may as well get me killed. Please stop me if you think I’ve lost my marbles.”

 

“Well, I’m all ears, miss Jahoda.”

 

=======================================

 

“-So, unfortunately we must ask to borrow the Eternal Moon’s Marrow to use as a power source for two weeks until the upcoming battle.”

 

How Ineffa could say that with a straight face to Lauma, then to Columbina herself was beyond Jahoda’s understanding.

 

To her credit, the Moonchanter had taken the blasphemy with as much sympathy as she could possibly afford after hearing their whole situation. Yet she insisted all three of them (Ineffa, Flins & Jahoda) to go in person to the Moon goddess and make their pleas directly to her. Unfortunately she didn’t provide instructions on how to keep themselves from getting smited for brazenly asking for the corpse of a former Moon goddess.

 

Columbina seemed to pause for a moment at the absurdity of the request, but soon hopped down from her moon-pedestal, and came towards them with smooth lunar grace. She began to circle Ineffa, eyeing her new design without opening them.

 

“You look quite more menacing than when we met last time. So you will use this Marrow to power your new body and fight, and maybe destroy, my long-time best friend, Sandrone?”

 

“Correct, Moon goddess. Your observation is very astute,” Ineffa replied, with her usual stoicism. This was bad.

 

“What she means is, uh, to use every precaution possible and make sure that both Aino and Sandrone are unharmed-”

 

Jahoda’s panicked tirade is interrupted as the moon-flowers on the ground turn crimson red, representing their goddess’s fury. A strong pull of Kuuvahki washes over her, and causes her mouth to snap shut. It is not painful or suffocating yet, but the message is clear enough.

 

“You are more honest then the Frostmoon Scions of old, who gave me offerings to help them defeat their enemies,” Columbina began. “And no, before you resort to that, not a thousand offerings can force me to go against Sandrone... not with all she has done to bring me back from the dead.”

 

Those words stung Jahoda. They were all friends and allies, united against Dottore just a few months ago. What had gone wrong in such a short time?

 

“Hmm, I see your concerns, Ms. Columbina. Perhaps we can come to some kind of arrangement, then,” Flins offered.

 

“Ms. Columbina, you also want your friends to stop fighting, and Aino to return home, right?”

 

“I do...”

 

“Then how about you pay Ms. Sandrone a long-awaited visit? Apparently she wishes to have a successor in Aino, which is why she resorted to such drastic action. Perhaps you can convince her of recruiting some... other talent who actually wishes to join the Fatui and continue her legacy?”

 

After a few moments, the red flowers turn back to blue, and Jahoda breathes a huge sigh of relief, having cheated death for the second time this month.

 

“I will try my best.”

 

=================================

 

Columbina Hyposelenia accepted Flins’ request partly out of sympathy, but also out of confusion, and worry for Sandrone.

 

None of her behavior made any sense. In all their centuries spent together as a harbinger, she never tried to have a successor – calling everyone “way too dense to follow in the footsteps of her genius.”

 

Yet now apparently she was desperate enough to kidnap one, and simultaneously no desperate enough to let her robot go so they could have a fair fight?

 

“Hello again, dear Sandrone\~. Can I go in?”

 

She tried to mask her worry through her normal, cheerful tone as she marched up to the tense Fatui guards in front of the gate. The guards didn’t respond, but the loudspeaker did.

  
“Oh, whatever. Just head to the tea room. Like my consent has ever stopped you from invading.”

 

Once she was in and Sandrone seated, the tea was poured. It was all such a familiar dance, yet the person in front of her was ever more of an enigma.

 

“You know why I’m here, Sandrone.”

 

“It’s about that Aino kid, isn’t it? Have they contacted you about it?”

 

“Ineffa, Jahoda and Flins – but please, don’t hurt them any further. They came to me and all they wanted was peace between friends, and answers – namely, why did you kidnap her?”

 

Columbina wisely left out the part about them first demanding a Moon Marrow to help obliterate her.

 

“What of it?! You and you new, goody-two shoes ‘friends’ seem to have forgotten that I am a Fatui harbinger! I use evil methods for my own personal goals! Why is this surprising to anyone?!”

 

“Well, it was surprising to me, at least,” Columbina grinned, glad to see Sandrone’s short temper again. “-And rather curious, too. What ‘goal’ could change our sweet Harbinger so much?”

 

“Like I would ever tell you any secret information. Now get lost.”

 

...Evidently it is going to be a long battle, but Columbina is no quitter. She waited for a millenia and more to defeat Dottore, and she can wait some more for her dear friend.

 

“No, Sandrone. In fact, I will stay here and starve myself until I die, or you confess your crimes in front of your moon goddess.”

 

“Fine! Go ahead and starve! See if I care! Pulonia, keep an eye on her!”

 

Sandrone marches out, snatching the tea and cookies away. How evil of her, but of course, all shall be absolved by the benevolent Moon goddess when she repents.

 

Pulonia, who is already used to this song and dance, ‘keeps an eye on her’ while quietly bringing her some treats and refreshments while Sandrone goes off to sulk in the corner.

 

It takes about thirty minutes, which is entirely expected. What isn’t expected... is that Sandrone’s face shows marks of oil dripping down from her eyes. Was she crying?

 

“...Do you really want to know?” Sandrone says in a solemn voice, as she sits down across the tea table and pours the strongest... liquor, not tea or even coffee.

 

“Yes, I still do.” She knows from experience that Sandrone only drank when she was devastated beyond productivity.

 

Wordlessly, Sandrone hands her an open envelope with the Royal Seal of Snezhnaya. In it there are two items: A renewed version of the arrest warrant for the Third Fatui Harbinger, also known as the Damselette, and a letter.

 

Columbina wordlessly flips it over, and reads the letter first.

 

*‘To the Seventh Fatui Harbinger Marionette.*

 

*Your plan to recruit ‘Ineffa’, the 11**^(th)* *Soverign Lord as our new Harbinger has been received, and has my royal seal of approval. You may capture and send her to Snezhnaya City as soon as possible.*

 

*This substitutes the arrest warrant for the third Harbinger, the Damselette*

 

*Remember, you have already been forgiven once.*

 

*Signed,*

*Her Excellency the Tsaritsa’*

 

Columbina was not dense. She understood the letter’s meaning the first time she read it. Yet she was forced to read it two, three times as the thin veneer of safety was lifted, and all the weight of reality that Sandrone had been holding back came crashing onto her.

 

“The Tsaritsa plays chess on the playing field of the gods, and as of now she is running out of pieces – us Harbingers. All the top three have either died or run away. Rosalyne has died. Tartaglia cannot fulfill his role yet. That leaves me, Pulcinella and Pantalone to be her pieces in this upcoming gambit against the Heavenly Principles. Woefully short, don’t you think?”

 

“And that is why she wanted me back, and she was furious when she fought against Dottore, and discovered that you basically let me walk away from the Fatui... Sandrone! You... you sacrificed Aino and Ineffa’s freedom for my own!”

 

She just chuckled sadly, the true nature of her cold-hearted plan now revealed in full.

 

“As Pantalone says... there is no such thing as a ‘free’ lunch. Aino was never the prize, just the decoy to lure Ineffa into the Fatui’s grasp. Did you really think I let her have that battle with Pulonia because I was enraged by the taunts of a 10-year-old child?”

 

Columbina recalled what the others had told her. How Aino was permitted to reforge Ineffa into a war machine because of Sandrone’s ego. That was all part of her plan to make Ineffa powerful enough to be called a Harbinger in her own right.

 

Yet she would still be defeated by Sandrone and Pulonia, with all the resources of the Fatui behind their back. Then Ineffa would be forced to act as a Harbinger and do the Tsaritsa’s bidding while Sandrone uses Aino as a hostage...

 

Enraged, Columbina summons the strength of Kuuvahki into the form of a hand, and grabs Sandrone’s throat, levitating her up from the ground.

 

“What if I defeat you, here and now? What happens then?”

 

“...Then the Tsaritsa invades Nod-Krai with all the Fatui’s strength. She takes the entire land hostage, forcing you to back into the Fatui along with Aino and Ineffa. That’s... that’s what I have been trying to hold back this entire time. I don’t think I can hold it back again.”

 

Columbina strengthens her grip, causing Sandrone to groan and choke.

 

“So you decided to chain them both to set me free... Today, you sound an awful lot like that monster Rerir, dear Sandrone.”

 

“Ergh, Ack.... heh, of course I do... after all, he and I have the same reason. The reason I still regret not saying during Moon-Prayer night.”

 

“No, I don’t want to hear it. Not now!”

 

She collapses to the ground again with a thud, the suffocating grip now gone. Columbina turns around and starts to walk away, almost fleeing from what Sandrone is about to say.

 

The real reason why she did all of this, a mutual feeling they never realized. Yet she hears it before she rounds the corner and disappears into the night.

I have not been able to find the right match, but have had many successful stops along the way that I am grateful for. The best connections I've had are from this subreddit which is why I keep coming back, and I'm here once again hoping to find my next one :)

**Appearance:** I am 6'2"" and 230 lbs with an average body type. I carry my weight very well, I'm handsome, medium length hair, and I'm a Caribbean/Latino mix! 

**Important information:**

▪︎ I live alone 

▪︎ I am clean/DDF 

▪︎ I am single and child free

▪︎ I do not smoke or do any drugs

▪︎ I drink only on special occasions (very rare)

**Three words to describe me:**

 Authentic - I am a very genuine, calm and  relaxing individual that brings good energy. I'm not into anything crazy or dramatic, I'm never trying to be someone I'm not.

Dependable - You need me for something? I'm there. Be it emotionally, physically or mentally. I am a good listener, I can provide good company, and I will make you feel safe in every scenario.

Affectionate - This word defines me. I am a man that thrives on touch, and it doesn't necessarily have to mean sexually. Hugs, skin to skin cuddles, random acts of touch, play fighting, just lighthearted intimacy in general is the way to my heart and I love having someone to share it with.

--

**Interests:**

▪︎ Basketball (playing and watching)

▪︎ Video games/Board games

▪︎ Trying restaurants or cooking

▪︎ Long walks

▪︎ Cycling 

▪︎ Documentaries

▪︎ Watching shows/movies (recommendations?)

▪︎ Animals (HUGE dog lover)

▪︎ Escape rooms 

▪︎ Cuddling (had to add that in there 😭❤️)

-- 

**What I want:**

I want a beautiful, affectionate and soft hearted woman to share a physically intimate connection with. I want you to feel comfortable around me, to the point where we can set up cute cuddle dates and just enjoy each other's company. Someone I can watch shows with, enjoy laughs with, eat out with, or even talk about mundane life things with. Relationships are complicated and I don't feel ready for one, but for the right woman that can change overtime. I know we can make each other happy and feel good without the pressure of commitment 🫶🏼

**What I want from you:**

I want you to bring good vibes and good energy to our connection. Be that calming, nurturing presence that makes every moment feel peaceful. Be affectionate, as I prefer a woman that values touch as much as I do. Good communication is key and shows me you care, so try to keep in touch and not go multiple days without texting. And lastly, be yourself. I want the real you, not a version of you that you'll think I prefer. Be what makes you beautiful.

-- 

**Preferences:**

▪︎ Weight-proportionate, curvy in the right places (**no BBWs**)

▪︎ Caribbean, Latina or Indian women +++ (opened to all races, this is just what I'm accustomed to).

▪︎ 20-45 in age (can go higher but won't go lower).

▪︎ Single and child free (I am as well).

▪︎ Emotionally available 

▪︎ Be clean (DDF)

▪︎ A woman that is attracted to mixed Black men with light brown skin (I am not dark skinned).

**Dealbreakers:**

▪︎ Poor communication

▪︎ Bad hygiene

▪︎ Catfishing (happens more often than I'd like lol)

--

If my post interested you, please send me a response indicating what stuck out, your age and what you want out of this connection. Be willing to exchange photos to see if attraction is mutual (your face can be blurred for the first photo for privacy concerns). We can set up a day/time that is convenient for us both to grab a coffee and feel each other out in person (no rush).

1r2y7jy,https://i.redd.it/b3lf5liyc3jg1.png,From Satoshis to Real-World Spending: My thoughts on the new GoMining Visa Card! ☕️🛒,"Hey GoMiners! 👋

The bridge between digital assets and daily life just got a lot shorter. I’ve been looking into the new **GoMining Visa Card** and how it integrates with our mining rewards.

As someone running a **59.21 TH/s** farm with a **10.51% service discount**, the goal has always been efficiency. But the ""end game"" is how we actually use those rewards. Being able to spend mining income directly via a Visa card is a massive step for the ecosystem's liquidity.

**What I’m looking at:**

* **Direct Integration:** Spending rewards without needing multiple exchange hops.
* **Global Acceptance:** Using mining profits for a morning coffee or online shopping.
* **Ecosystem Growth:** This adds huge utility to the platform and $GOMINING.

I’m currently focusing on keeping my efficiency at **15 W/TH** to maximize the liquid rewards that will eventually fund my card balance. It feels like the ""Mining-as-a-Service"" model is finally becoming a full financial tool.

**Are you planning to order the virtual or the physical card?** And more importantly, do you think this utility will help bring more traditional investors into the GoMining ecosystem?

1r2y0hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietypilled/comments/1r2y0hm/the_monkey_in_my_house_keeps_killing_people/,The Monkey In My House Keeps Killing People,"I woke up one day and it was just there. I got out of bed to brew myself some coffee when I noticed the intruder. There was a chimpanzee sitting on my couch. I moved towards the couch to get a closer look to make sure I was really seeing a monkey on my couch. The primate stared at me as I moved across the room. As I got closer, the chimp bared its fangs and started to bark at me. 



I took a step back and the monkey started to settle down. I went to grab my phone when I heard keys jingling outside my front door. Both our attention turned to the door and my sister opened the door. She walked in with her phone between her ear and her shoulder and a large paper bag in the hand that wasn’t holding her keys. She closed the door with her foot and set the bag down as she said her goodbyes to the person on the other line. She goes to greet me when she addresses the elephant in the room, or monkey in the room. 



“Is that a chimpanzee?” She asked with confusion. “Yeah I don't know how it got here.” I responded. “I was about to call..” I was cut off by the chimp howling again. The chimp leaped up and pounced on my poor sister. Her screams were drowned out by the screeching of the monkey. I tried to get the primate off her but as soon as I got close, it hissed at me. I took a step back in shock and watched as my sister got turned into a mass of meat, blood, and bone before me. 



I came to my senses and I started to call 911. As I was getting connected with the operator, my doorbell rang. Just as I heard a voice on the phone answering, I heard the voice of my neighbor knocking at my door. I had forgotten I had lent my sugar to them and now they were returning it. 



I yelled out to warn them but the door was already opening. The sweet old woman that lived next door was tackled by the ape. I cried to the 911 operator, trying to explain the situation but I wasn't doing a good job. The lady on the phone kept trying to tell me to calm down but it was hard to do when I was watching this poor lady get her face eaten. The thing that woke me out of my shock was the lady's lower jaw being flung at me. The jaw and dentures fell apart as they hit me then they clattered to the ground. 



I ran to my bedroom and slammed my door closed. I slumped to the ground as I tried to stop hyperventilating. The woman on the phone said she was trying to track my location but I needed to stay on the line with her. 



“Chimp…” I gasped. “There is a chimp killing people.” 



The 911 operator finally understood what I was saying but it was too late. I saw two girl scouts pulling a wagon full of cookies towards me. I started sobbing as I heard the girls shriek. The beast had noticed them and began to charge at them. I begged for the cops, the army, anyone to come and stop this infernal being. The 911 operator told me that she alerted the police but she couldn’t get a hold of the firefighters that were in route. 



I heard the sirens approaching as the chimps howled again. Challenging the sirens for dominance. The firetrucks pulled up and I just closed my eyes as I prayed that this would all end. I heard a commotion from the firefighters as the ape attacked them. The yelling was mixed with wet thunks and the screams of the primate. I threw my phone in utter hopelessness at my situation. The chaotic symphony died down as the only sounds that remained were a wet gurgling and the haunting laughter of the chimp. 



This was interrupted by the sounds of large trucks approaching. I crawled over to the window and peered over the ledge to get a glimpse of the new challengers. My eyes scan over the carnage of broken bodies, blood, and guts strewn across the lawn like a war zone. I then see large black vans pulling up. The back doors fly open and armed SWAT officers file out. They point their guns at the chimpanzee. 



The chimp let out its primal war cry as it flung itself at the new threats. Gunshots rang out through the air as the officers opened fire at the charging beast. They all miss as the chimp latches onto the face of the lead grunt as the others turn their guns on the monkey. They fired again but the chimp leaps away in time, but the bullets still hit, blowing off the head of the lead SWAT officer. The chimp grabbed a pistol from another officer as it swung around the group like a jungle gym. The monkey fired the sidearm into the group as it flipped around the group. The gunshots from the primate mixed with the haphazard spray of bullets took the group down. The chimp sat upon its bested foes and it noticed me. It pointed the gun at me and before I could duck, I heard the gun click empty. I shuddered as the ape bared its fangs in a mocking smile. 



I now sit cowering in my room as a war rages outside. Gunshots, explosions, and yells are constant as helicopters can be heard overhead. Last I heard from the news, they are bringing in tanks but at this point, I doubt anything can defeat this demonic simian.

*  **Description:** I’m a software engineer.

Last week was mostly coffee, code, and sandwiches I never finished.



This didn’t start as a serious plan or a product.

I was just tired of how little freedom most games actually give you.



Usually you pick from a list — skills, talents, builds.

Even when the list is big, you’re still playing inside someone else’s rules.



So I started building a small turn-based RPG around one idea: freedom.



You don’t just unlock abilities here.

You create them.

You build your own talents, combine mechanics, experiment with weird ideas, break things, and see what actually works.



It’s not a game you’re supposed to grind for hours.

More like something you open when you have 15–20 free minutes, try a new build, and move on.



At some point, the game felt way too serious.

So now, when you get crit, dodge an attack, or do something dumb, you might see a reaction gif.

Very often it’s a cat.

No deep reason — it just made the game more fun.



The game will be free.

No pay-to-win. No buying power.



And honestly, I don’t really want to play it alone.

If you like turn-based RPGs built around experimentation and creativity, it would be cool to have someone to play with, test ideas, and mess around together.



I’m also open to suggestions.

If you have ideas for what kind of cat gifs should trigger on different effects — crits, dodges, fails, weird builds — I’d love to hear them.

\-I feel like projects move faster because everyone is focused on their own tasks, and any team member  is just a google chat message away

\-I spend less money on transportation, meals and afternoon coffees

\-My day feels more efficient, and it's easir to maintain a routine without exhaustion

This idea was not something mentioned in the passing and was something that we both had confirmed we'd do, at least that's what i thought. I had assured her it was okay to reject if she didn't want to hang out with me, I wouldn't take offense. Finally, I am back for the holiday and we determine the date we'd hang out. I tell them ill inform them of exact time in few days. I text them if they wanna grab drink first or later and i get told that she doesn't want to go ice ring. After some asking and her reason is that she just doesn't feel like. Weird and disappointing considering this is something we had talked about multiple times in months but whatever, mood changes, things happen. Day later, she asks if we could change the meet up spot which is closer to her house and further away from me but not by big margin. I think fine not too big of a deal. Then on they day of the hang out, few hours before we are suppose to meet, she cancel because she feels inexplicably horrible.

1r2xwrx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2xwrx,Ecstatic to hit level 5!,"TL;DR: I am absolutely in love with this language and learning methodology! It works; keep grinding!

Background: I'm a mid 30's gringo that started DS with 2 years of high school Spanish experience (but that was 20 years ago). I've always been interested in Spanish, but never understood the path to fluency. I started my journey with 50 hours for my studies over the years, which included a vacation to Costa Rica.

0-300: I discovered DS mid 2024. The first 300 hours were a real grind for me. I would get extremely sleepy after only 20-30 minutes. But that's okay, sucking at something is the first step to becoming sorta good at something! 

In April of 2025 I went to Spain to do the Camino (Primitivo) de Santiago with 200 hours. It was AMAZING. Of course, I struggled a lot with the language given my limited experience. But 200 hours is definitely better than nothing! I was able to greet people in coffee shops, ask what things are called, and have scripted conversations at restaurants or hostels. 

I started listening to podcasts  around 200-250 hours which was my first game changer. I listened to every episode of Cuentame and Chill Spanish. I also continued DS but at this point I was wanting to mix it up after needing the visual aids for the first 200 hours.

  
300-600: At this point I bought some bone conducting headphones. This was my second game changer. They are SO comfortable. I didn't expect to love them so much. I put them on and start a podcast before my feet even hit the floor in the morning. By the time my morning routine is over I already have a half hour of input. At this stage I listened to all of Espanol al Vuelo (my favorite podcast so far), a bunch of Learn Spanish and Go, SBG, and ECJ. I also finally unlocked my first anime near the 600 hour mark. I've seen it before, but Kotaro Lives Alone is unlocked for me now and its a super cute anime. My future goalposts are unlocking Community and then Caso Cerrado.

I got laid off during this stage and it changed everything... I decided to take a sabbatical and use that time to study Spanish. I knew I could use the break and my industry is not in good shape right now anyway. I quickly started ramping up my input to start speed running:

10/25: 20 hours  
11/25: 45 hours  
12/25: 126 hours  
1/26: 168 hours

Speed running has been SO much fun and I would recommend it to anyone crazy enough to do it. Don't worry about diminishing returns because they are still returns. Don't burn yourself out though. Take breaks if you aren't having fun. When your brain doesn't want any more input for the day you will know.

  
600-?: I am hoping to hit 1000 hours by the summer and 1500 by the EOY. I am planning to start speaking and reading somewhere between 800 and 1000 hours. It is starting to get hard to refrain from speaking. I am so excited to continue this journey! It feels like it is expanding my mind, my circle, and my life!

**£12/hour.** When you spend £10 on a takeaway, that is an hour of your life gone. You can never get it back. If you accept that valuation of your time, you are accepting the script. You are accepting that you are a ""resource"" to be deployed by a corporation until you are empty.

**1. The Rocket Theory** 

A rocket burns 80% of its fuel in the first 15 minutes. It fights gravity. It shakes. It feels like it’s going to explode. It pushes a boulder up a hill. But once it breaks the atmosphere? It floats. It takes almost zero energy to get to the moon.

Most people quit during the shake. They hate the ""Monk Mode"" phase. They want balance. They want ""fun on Saturdays."" You cannot have balance during launch. You need to be obsessed. You need to be toxic. You need to be a ghost.

**2. The Law of Unreasonable Success** 

I don’t believe in ""talent."" I believe in math. If you say you are ""bad at math,"" you aren't bad. You just haven't done enough problems to make it **unjustified** for you to be bad.

Success is just grinding to the point where it becomes **unreasonable** for you to fail. Work so much that it would be weird if you were still broke. Program yourself like a robot. Robots don't look for results every 10 minutes. Robots just execute the code.

**3. ""When in Doubt, Create.""** 

This is my golden rule for burnout. The doubt will come. ""Is this working?"" ""Am I wasting my time?"" That thought is cancer.

How do you kill it? **Creation.** Our ancestors felt good when they built a hut or hunted a deer. Creation = Survival. When I feel depressed, I don't go to therapy. I don't doomscroll. I build something.

1r2xvsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1r2xvsh/due_date_week_hits_hard/,Due Date Week Hits Hard,"My due date for the baby I MC in July last year came and went this week. I was due on Tuesday. I didn't realize how numb I would feel. We weren't planning on finding out the sex of the baby until he/she was born, and I will never know because my MC happened at home and was so fast. My husband thinks knowing would have been harder, but I find myself hyper fixated on that this week.  
  
I feel so naive. I thought for sure I'd at the very least be pregnant again by now. I got pregnant so easily last year- I had a chemical in April, which was our first cycle trying, and then got pregnant again right away the following month in May with the baby I miscarried. I made it to 12 weeks and miscarried early in the morning on the day we were supposed to hear the baby's heartbeat for the first time, which felt so cruel. People tell me it was probably easier that way, compared to going in to the doctor only to be told there is no heartbeat, but I'm not so sure. I had no idea that the spotting and cramping I was experiencing the day before was my body gearing up to MC, my doctor told me it was all normal in early pregnancy. I still have flashbacks of the night it happened, being woken up from my sleep to a popping sensation and then passing nearly everything in a matter of 20 minutes. And the weird thing is I had a dream that it was going to happen to me 2 nights before, the same way it actually did. We went to a fertility doctor and I had a RLP, all of our testing is normal. I don't understand why it happened so easily before, and why it's not now. 

The other thing that sucks is the changes that have happened to my body in such a short timespan. I'm at least 15 lbs overweight now. I've always been an athlete. My clothes don't fit. I hate the way my body looks in everything. I'm afraid to even attempt to lose weight because I don't want to stress my body out more while I'm trying to get pregnant. This is probably going to sound terrible too, but I compare myself and my husband to other couples we know with kids, and I don't understand how/why we can't get pregnant, but they can. We don't smoke, drink, or do any drugs- EVER. We work out. We drink coffee and water only. What gives? 

I just needed to vent. The alone feeling that accompanies you after you have a miscarriage is like nothing I've ever felt before. I feel like part of me died along with my baby, and I'm praying I get it back. I don't like this version of me. Thank you for listening. ",1,1770913466.0,Miscarriage,2,1.0,False

I feel like I'm starting to hate people and need to do something before it's too late.,"Right off the bat: 'hate' isn't the best word. I'm caught up in my feelings at the moment and I'll return to my regular emotionless and stoic mentality in a few days, the same one society is comfortable in me being.

I'm 45, a dateless virgin and that's not changing anytime fucking soon. I asked out a woman I work with. Been having close conversations with her for months now, she even started flirting, or I what think flirting is. I don't know what this shit is, I just know she starts off saying 'I look good today', light punches with laughter and all that. TLDR: I slowly open up, we talk often for the past few months of working closely together and I asked her out on Saturday. Of course she says no, because what other answer could I get?

Well, she didn't show up for her shifts this week, apparently I made her uncomfortable and awkward.. That's not my problem but I feel like it's gonna made to be my problem. I don't understand the human mating process at all. I'm 45, will be 46 in a few months and I could never get a single woman to even spend 10 minutes with me to get coffee. I'm getting to the point where I wish I was asexual, it would make everything so much easier. This bitterness is causing to me ask questions like 'what is even the point in liking people?'

How am I in this situation? I was a fat and socially awkward kid, deal with a shit ton of rejections, with no success as a teenager. Became a morbidly obese man after college. At 6'6 and 500+ lbs, I either disgusted or terrified woman, which no doubt hindered my chances. I lost the weight and gained muscle at 40 but fear it was done too late. The decades of social ostracization have taken it's toll. With no experience and women in their 40's being less outgoing or just not available, it feels like I missed out. Like I have to deal with an every increasing ways to face rejection. Like it seriously shouldn't be this hard. I see couples all the time and wonder: what are they saying? What are they doing? What is the script or set of words to say to someone to being a relationship?

I'm here to take my chances to get to know a person. I believe that one of the most important decisions in life is choosing a partner. It can literally make or break a person's trajectory in life. So here are a few things about me that I wanna share.

\*\*About me\*\*

I'm from Manila and is relatively new here. I would like someone to share the city life with me.

\*\*Finances\*\*

About me: I'm pretty comfortable with what I have. I don't make so much money like politicians but i hope to earn more than what I have today in a cleaner way.

About you: Preferably want someone who values money and has no debt. I just want someone who is also mindful with expenses. No gambling addiction pls.

\*\*Family\*\*

About me: I do want to start a family but I want both my partner and I to be emotionally, mentally, financially stable. I am close with my family and we talk often.

About you: Looking for someone who has the same mindset.

\*\*Fitness\*\*

About me: I am someone who goes to the gym regularly, I am not yung super gymrat but I do value my fitness well to care.

About you: Don't mind if hindi ka naga gym as long as you are not letting yourself be undisciplined with your health. Must be normal BMI!

\*\*Other things\*\*

About me: I'm around 5'9 or 5'10 depende sa sapatos ata lol. I'm medium light-skinned and i'm not chubby nor payat. Looks better in person. I like learning and playing video games.

About you: Share me about yourself in a message so we can talk about it. Include ""Compressor"" in your message so I know you have read till the end.

\*\*Edit: After a few tries with this, I have new sets of dealbreakers\*\*

1. You must be in manila, I really can't handle LDRs so I prefer someone I can meet with coffee.
2. Physically, you must be fit!

I’m currently recovering at my friends house and I’m getting around fine but enjoying having the company and help with my dog. 

I had my surgery Tuesday afternoon and unfortunately had a bad reaction to the anesthesia and woke up vomiting bile and unable to keep anything down. They maxed me out on zofran and another anti-nausea med and admitted me to the hospital overnight. I was given IV dilaudid and fentanyl in the hospital along with zofran and once able to hold down liquids I took oxycodone and a muscle relaxer. Since getting home I’ve been managing the pain with Aleve and one 5mg Percocet last night. Taking colace as well and no zofran since Weds morning. 

My question now is how long should I wait before taking a laxative? Last BM was Tues morning before surgery and it’s now Thurs afternoon. I’m usually very regular and I worry about constipation. I know pain meds can cause some constipation and I’m working to get off them as much as I can - the pain is very manageable with Aleve/Tylenol.

Here is the timeline of food:

Sunday night: last solid food before surgery

Monday: clear liquid diet (water, sprite, jello)

Tues: nothing prior to surgery and unable to hold liquids down 

Weds: started tolerating liquids around 3am and had broth, clear ensure, water in hospital. Had pudding, yogurt, applesauce/veggie pouch, small pita and hummus, mashed potatoes around 3pm-10pm. 

Thurs: applesauce/veggie pouch and half a grilled cheese

I’m drinking a coffee now and hoping for the best and just trying to get some fiber and soft foods in. Just not sure when to get the miralax on deck or when it becomes a concern.

I almost choked on my coffee. Not from laughter. From the sheer cosmic absurdity of being asked to celebrate romance by someone who treats me with all the sexual enthusiasm of a DMV employee processing license renewals.

What should I get her? A fucking participation trophy? “Congratulations on Another Year of Successfully Avoiding Physical Intimacy While Maintaining Plausible Deniability.” They don’t sell those at Target, I checked.

Maybe lingerie? Oh wait, that’s hilarious. I could buy her something sexy that’ll sit in a drawer next to the other five sets I’ve bought over the years, collecting dust like archaeological evidence of my optimism. Future scientists will carbon-date that shit and use it to study the extinction of hope in the male species.

Jewelry? “Here honey, something else that’s precious and never gets touched. Thought you’d appreciate the symbolism.”

Chocolates shaped like hearts? Perfect. Dead on the inside, just like our marriage’s sex life. At least the chocolate won’t give me excuses about being tired, stressed, needing to wake up early, or my personal favorite: “Maybe this weekend?” (Narrator: It was never that weekend.🥲)

The fucking JOKE of it all is that she’s serious. She actually expects a romantic gesture from the husband she’s basically friendzoned in his own marriage. Like I’m supposed to light candles and plan a special evening that’ll end exactly how every other evening ends: with me staring at the ceiling at 2 AM wondering if this is just my life now, calculating how many more Valentine’s Days I have left on this earth to spend celebrating absolutely nothing.

I think I’ll get her a nice potted plant. Something that requires regular care and attention to survive. You know, as a subtle fucking hint.

And the thing is, i should care because I've always cared, but in the past month i have been fucked over so many times by so many people and so many circumstances that I'm just numb. Like f that im going to go walk in the park and get lemonade, and nobody can stop me because i just won't tell anyone. Actually now that im writing all this out, I sound like such a fucking loser like wdym my act of rebellion is drinking coffee. Ok whatever let a nerdy bitch have some fun after realizing hs was never that deep and that i did all that for nothing.

About you: Preferably want someone who values money and has no debt. I just want someone who is also mindful with expenses. No gambling addiction pls.

\*\*Family\*\*

\*\*Fitness\*\*

About me: I am someone who goes to the gym regularly, I am not super duper fit but I am health concious.

1. You must be in Manila, I really can't handle LDRs so I prefer someone I can meet with coffee.
2. My type would be maputi, feminine, and petite.
3. Must be funny, although that's subjective xD
4. Ideally, someone who is into math, business, science, and or video games. Not really a must have but I think we'll resonate more.

I have two cats (gizmo and gadget, almost 2y/o and both female). I’ve had them since they were both 8 weeks old and they are litter mates. They have been best friends ever since. A few months ago, I also got two ferrets. The ferrets and them get along and they play often. Yesterday, I did my usual morning routine by letting the ferrets out to play for a bit and started making my coffee. When all of a sudden I heard one of the cats start meowing in distress. When I looked, gizmo had made her way into the ferret cage and was on the third floor of it on the inside. Gadget was on top of the cage on the outside and it seemed like she was yelling at gizmo.

When I took gizmo out of the cage, gadget just attacked gizmo and started chasing her all around my apartment. Gizmo got scared and went and hid on top of the fridge and I tried to grab gadget but she was hissing at me and even swatted at me (which she has never done!) I was able to lure her into my bedroom to separate them and that’s where she’s been ever since yesterday. Gizmo calmed down and returned to her sweet self and wanted love and kisses as usual.

Gadget, however, wants nothing to do with me. Whenever I go into my bedroom, I’m terrified. She hisses, growls, swats at me with her claws. Complete and total switch up from her usual sweet self. She’s never aggressive, ever. This morning, I tried opening the door a bit so they could see each other. Gizmo (the cat who was attacked) then got mad at me and started hissing at me because she thought I was going to let her out. When I went into the bedroom, gadget is still hissing and growling at me!

I don’t know what to do. I’m stressed and have never been in this situation before. These two were best friends. I thought maybe gizmo got the ferret scent on her and that’s why gadget freaked out but I have no clue. My best friend, who is a vet tech, suggested we get a crate with litter and food and put it in the living room with gadget inside so gizmo and her can get used to each other again. I’m just worried about another cat fight. If you have tips, suggestions or anything that may help me out, please let me know! Im desperate.",1,1770912903.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

Chapter Four

The first feeding happened three days later.

I'd spent those days settling into a routine that felt increasingly surreal—fixing a leaky faucet in Seraphina's bathroom, researching HVAC maintenance for a system that cost more than most houses, and having a fifteen-minute argument with Isla about whether the wifi router needed to be reset (it did, she was just being stubborn).

The washing machine part had arrived. I'd installed it in twenty minutes while Vivienne watched from the stairs, sketching me with unnerving focus.

""You have interesting hands,"" she'd said.

""Thanks. They're great for holding wrenches.""

""That's not what I meant.""

I'd learned not to ask Vivienne to clarify. Her clarifications were somehow always more unsettling than the original statement.

But the feeding—that I'd been avoiding thinking about. Easier to focus on broken appliances and household maintenance than the reality that I was literally on the menu.

Nadya brought it up over breakfast. Well, my breakfast. She was sitting at the kitchen island with a cup of coffee she didn't need, watching me demolish a plate of eggs and toast.

""We should probably discuss the feeding schedule,"" she said carefully.

I paused mid-bite. ""Now?""

""You've been here three days. We've been… patient. But we do need to feed regularly.""

""Right. Yeah. I knew that."" I set down my fork. ""How does this work exactly?""

""However you're most comfortable with,"" Nadya said. ""Thomas preferred his wrist. Quick, efficient. Heals fast.""

""Did it hurt?""

""He said it was uncomfortable at first. A sharp pinch. But our saliva has mild anesthetic properties—it numbs the area after a few seconds.""

""Your saliva has anesthetic properties.""

""Among other things. Evolution made us very efficient predators.""

I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. ""Who goes first?""

""I thought I would,"" Nadya said. ""If that's alright. I'm… gentle. It might be easier for your first time.""

First time. Like losing my virginity, except instead of awkward fumbling it was a vampire drinking my blood. Cool. Totally normal.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Where do you want to do this?""

""Here is fine. Or your room, if you'd prefer privacy.""

""Here's good. Let's just… get it over with.""

Nadya moved around the island with that liquid grace they all had. She was wearing soft clothes today—leggings and an oversized sweater that made her look almost human. Almost.

""Give me your wrist,"" she said gently.

I extended my right arm. My hand was shaking slightly. Nadya pretended not to notice.

She cradled my wrist in both hands, examining it like she was reading a map. Her skin was cool. Not cold exactly, but cooler than human. Her thumb found my pulse point.

""Try to relax,"" she said.

""Sure. Relaxing. That's definitely what I'm doing right now.""

She smiled. ""I promise it's not as bad as you're imagining.""

Then she bit down.

The initial pain was sharp—her teeth breaking skin, finding the vein. I hissed through my teeth, instinct making me want to pull away. But Nadya held firm, and then—

The numbness came. Spread from the bite site up my arm, warm and almost pleasant. Like novocaine at the dentist, but less clinical. More… intimate.

I could feel her drinking. Feel my pulse syncing with her swallows. It should've been horrifying. Instead it was just strange. Deeply, profoundly strange.

She didn't take much. Maybe thirty seconds, forty at most. Then she pulled back, running her tongue over the wound. When she released my wrist, there were just two small puncture marks, already closing.

""See?"" she said softly. ""Not so terrible.""

I stared at my wrist. The marks were fading as I watched, skin knitting back together at an impossible rate.

""That's the vampire blood in your system,"" Nadya explained. ""You heal faster than normal humans now. The marks will be gone in an hour.""

""Right. Super healing. Because why not."" I flexed my fingers. Everything worked fine. No pain, just a lingering warmth where she'd bitten. ""How do you feel?""

""Better. Thank you."" She looked different—subtle, but there. More color in her cheeks. More life in her eyes. ""You taste good, by the way. Clean. Healthy.""

""Is that a compliment?""

""It's an observation. Some humans taste bitter—stress, poor diet, medications. You taste like…"" She considered. ""Sunlight. Odd, but that's what comes to mind.""

""I taste like sunlight.""

""Yes.""

""The thing that can kill you if your exposed to long.""

""Ironic, isn't it?"" She smiled. ""The rest of the sisters will probably want to feed over the next few days. Pace yourself. Drink plenty of water, eat iron-rich foods. Your body will replace what we take quickly, but you should still be mindful.""

""Any other vampire feeding tips?""

""Don't let Isla feed when she's excited. She gets overenthusiastic and takes too much.""

""Good to know.""

Nadya stood, carrying her coffee cup to the sink. ""Thank you, Dean. I know this isn't easy for you.""

""Yeah, well. Beats being dead on Route 47.""

""That's the spirit. Very glass-half-full.""

After she left, I sat at the island for a long time, staring at my wrist where the marks had completely vanished.

I'd just been fed on by a vampire.

This was my life now.

 

Seraphina was next, that evening. She found me in Thomas's office—that was now my office—doing an inventory of supplies.

""Nadya said you handled the feeding well,"" she said from the doorway.

""Define 'well.'""

""You didn't faint or have a panic attack.""

""The bar is impressively low.""

She moved into the room with that eerie grace, examining the bookshelves like she hadn't seen them a thousand times before.

""May I?"" she asked, gesturing to my wrist.

""Sure. Everyone else is going to anyway, right?""

""We could use blood bags,"" Seraphina said. ""We have in the past. But fresh is better. More nourishing.""

""I'm like farm-to-table dining.""

""Exactly."" She took my wrist carefully. Her hands were cooler than Nadya's, her grip more clinical. ""This will be quick.""

It was. She bit precisely, drank efficiently, and released me within twenty seconds.

""You taste curious,"" she said, studying me.

""Is that good or bad?""

""Neither. Just interesting. There's a complexity to you. Most humans are straightforward—fear, resignation, sometimes arousal.""

""Wait, arousal?""

""Some humans find the feeding erotic,"" Seraphina said matter-of-factly. ""The intimacy of it. The exchange of fluids. The power dynamic.""

""Yeah, I'm not getting that.""

""Good. It would complicate things."" She released my wrist. ""Thank you, Dean. Your blood is quite pleasant.""

""Happy to be pleasant.""

After she left, I made a note to find out if vampire feeding was always this weirdly polite or if this family was just exceptional at manners.

 

Carmilla fed two days later.

I was replacing a light fixture in the third-floor hallway when she appeared behind me, silent as death.

""Jesus!"" I nearly dropped the screwdriver.

""Blasphemy,"" she said dryly. ""How very mortal of you.""

""Sneaking up on people. How very vampire of you.""

""I need to feed.""

""Can I finish installing this light first? I'm kind of standing on a ladder.""

""Of course. I'm not an animal.""

I finished securing the fixture, tested it—perfect—and climbed down. Carmilla was watching me with that calculating expression she always had, like I was a problem she was solving.

""Wrist,"" she said. Not a question.

I held it out. She gripped it firmly, no gentleness, and bit down harder than her sisters had. The pain lasted longer before the numbness kicked in.

She drank for nearly a minute. Longer than the others. I started to feel lightheaded, the edges of my vision going fuzzy.

""That's enough,"" I said.

She ignored me. Kept drinking.

""Carmilla. That's enough.""

She released me abruptly, eyes flashing with something predatory. For a second—just a second—I saw what she really was. Not a beautiful woman. A hunter. A killer.

Then it passed and she was back to cool efficiency.

""You have limits,"" she said. ""Good. Thomas never did. He'd let us take until he couldn't stand.""

""Thomas sounds like he had boundary issues.""

""Thomas was devoted. There's a difference."" She examined my wrist where the bite was already healing. ""You're stronger than he was. Less willing to be a victim.""

""Is that a problem?""

""No,"" she said, something like respect in her voice. ""It's refreshing.""

She left without another word.

I sat on the ladder's top step, head between my knees, waiting for the dizziness to pass.

Three down. Two to go.

 

Vivienne found me that night.

I was in my room, reading—trying to distract myself from the weirdness of my new existence. She knocked once, barely audible, then entered without waiting for permission.

""I want to paint you while I feed,"" she said.

""That's a sentence I never thought I'd hear.""

""I'm serious. I've been sketching you, but I want to capture the moment. The exchange. The intimacy of it.""

""Vivienne, I don't think—""

""Please."" She looked at me with those intense dark eyes. ""I haven't been inspired like this in decades. You're different. I want to understand why.""

There was genuine passion in her voice. Desperation, even.

""Fine,"" I sighed. ""But if this ends up in a gallery somewhere, I'm suing for royalties.""

She smiled—bright and real. ""Deal.""

She set up in my room, easel and paints appearing from somewhere. Made me sit in the chair by the window, positioned just right.

""Wrist,"" she said, kneeling beside me.

I gave it to her. She stared at the veins visible under the skin, tracing them with one cool finger.

""You're beautiful in structure,"" she said. ""Do you know that? The way your body works. All these systems, perfectly balanced.""

""Thanks?""

She bit down—less clinical than Seraphina, less forceful than Carmilla. There was an artistry to it, like she was trying to make even the feeding aesthetic.

While she drank, she sketched with her free hand. Quick, sure strokes. I watched, fascinated despite the strangeness of the situation.

When she finished, she showed me the canvas.

It was me, but not quite. She'd captured something in my expression—not fear, not resignation. Determination, maybe. Defiance. Like I was daring the universe to throw one more impossible thing at me.

""Is that how you see me?"" I asked.

""It's how you are,"" Vivienne said. ""Whether you know it or not.""

 

Isla was last.

She ambushed me in the basement while I was doing laundry. Her laundry, specifically not sure how I got roped into do laundry duty by here I am. 

""My turn!"" she announced, way too cheerfully.

""Nadya said you take too much when you're excited.""

""Nadya worries too much. I'll be good. Promise.""

She was not good.

She bit down enthusiastically, and I felt the pull immediately—stronger than the others, more demanding. My vision started tunneling faster.

""Isla,"" I said. ""Isla, that's enough.""

She made a sound of protest but didn't stop.

""Isla!"" I grabbed her shoulder with my free hand, pushed hard enough to make my point.

She released me, looking sheepish. ""Sorry. You just taste really good. Like, really, really good.""

""Yeah, I've heard. But I'd like to keep enough blood to actually function.""

""Right. Sorry. I'll be better next time.""

""There's going to be a next time?""

""Well, yeah. Once a week, remember? Forever. Or at least until you're old and die like Thomas.""

Forever. The word hit differently than it should have.

I looked at my wrist where five sets of bite marks had healed over the past week. Looked at Isla, who was trying very hard to appear apologetic and failing because she was still riding the high of fresh blood.

This was my life now. Weekly feedings. Household repairs. Living with five vampire sisters and their terrifying father.

Forever.

Or at least until I was old and died like Thomas.

At a hundred and forty something I was hoping I’d get to live a bit longer.

""Hey Isla?"" I said.

""Yeah?""

""Next time, maybe feed after dinner. When I'm at full capacity.""

She brightened. ""That's actually really smart. See, you're already getting the hang of this!""

""Yeah,"" I muttered. ""I'm a regular expert at being vampire food. Someone alert the press.""

She laughed and bounded back upstairs, leaving me alone with the laundry and the growing realization that I was adapting to this insanity way faster than I probably should be.

Which was either a good sign or a very, very bad one.

I finished the laundry, carried it upstairs, and tried not to think too hard about what my life had become.

But that night, lying in bed in a room that was slowly becoming mine, I caught myself smiling.

It was insane. It was impossible. It was definitely Stockholm syndrome or some kind of vampire mind control.

But I was alive. I was healing faster than any human should. And I was surrounded by people—creatures—who were starting to feel less like captors and more like…

Something else.

I wasn't ready to call it family yet.

But maybe, eventually, I could get there.",2,1770912899.0,NaturesTemper,2,1.0,False

And weird they got. Vic returned to find his Silent doorstep drowning in flower petals—rose, tulip and hydrangea. *Please, please, please let these be from that girl across the hall. Don’t let those mustache dudes know about this place.* 

 

He went online. There was no Internet jack in his apartment, but a wireless router broadcasted from somewhere within the building. Scrolling through his favorite websites—Ain’t It Cool News, Newsarama and *The Onion*—he comprehended none of what he read. His thoughts kept circling around to his real home, pondering what his neighbors would come up with next. 

 

*I know that the Silent Minority has hidden cameras monitoring my house. I wonder if they’d let me tap into their feed. But how do I ask them? They gave me no email address, no phone number to call. I’m supposed to wait for contact, but when the hell will that be?*   

 

For a moment, his mind flashed upon a classic *Twilight Zone* episode, “People Are Alike All Over.” *Is that what’s happening? Am I an exhibit in a human zoo? Is this wall gonna slide sideways, revealing a crowd of cackling gawkers?* 

 

*Tomorrow*, he promised himself. *I’ll solve this mystery tomorrow.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

The next morning, he found the doorstep flower petals dead. Upon them, a serving tray rested, populated with three domed dishes, which turned out to be Korean barbecue short ribs, corn on the cob, and grits. 

 

*Kind of a strange breakfast combination,* Vic thought. But when he began eating, everything made sense. *Holy shit, that’s good. Like…crazy good. Who is this chick anyway, some traumatized master chef? Is it too early to propose marriage?* 

 

He ate and ate, moaning contentedly, his shirt catching errant splatter. An entire family-sized meal went down his gullet, leaving Vic barely able to waddle to the couch. 

 

Too stuffed to investigate, he decided to give the mystery another day. Or two.  

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Stealthy footsteps, a door opening and closing—sounds which drew Vic from bed just past two A.M. Bypassing a cardboard envelope left on the entryway floor, he raced into the hallway. Its single bulb was out; all was dark. He saw a shadow sliding on shadows, and heard the stairwell door being hurled open. 

 

“Wait a minute!” he hollered, pursuing the intruder halfway down the stairs. Realizing that he was wearing only boxers, fearful of looking like a sex maniac, he aborted the chase.

 

Instead, he went back inside to give the envelope the ol’ pick-and-rip. It contained a recordable DVD with the words *WATCH ME* scribbled on it. *Thanks for the suggestion,* Vic thought sarcastically. *Otherwise, I might have tried flossing my teeth with it.* 

 

Reclining on the couch, his eyes crusted and sleep-swollen, he watched the video. It began with a text scroll, just like the *Star Wars* films. 

 

*HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF SKEWLCLIPS?* it asked. *IT’S A CROSS BETWEEN YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK, A SITE WHEREIN FRIEND GROUPS SHARE VIDEO CLIPS FEATURING THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS. SINCE THE SITE IS UNMONITORED, AND ONLY PREAPPROVED FRIENDS CAN WATCH THE VIDEOS, AN ANYTHING GOES MENTALITY HAS INFECTED IT. NOW, THE MOST POPULAR CLIPS INVOLVE BULLYING.*

 

*HOW DO WE KNOW THIS? WE CRACKED THE CODE WIDE OPEN. GHOSTLIKE, WE NOW DRIFT FROM ONE PEER GROUP TO THE NEXT, IDENTIFYING THE BIGGEST BULLIES, REPLAYING THEIR CRIMES AGAINST OUR KIND IN PIXEL PANORAMAS. HERE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS:*

 

The video featured a group of football players entering a locker room. Their purple and grey uniforms were grass-stained and sweat-soaked. Presumably, they’d just left the field.  

 

*MEET EAST PACIFIC HIGH SCHOOL’S FAMOUS FOOTBALL TEAM, THE SQUIDS*, the text read. *AS THE LATEST ITERATION OF THE INSTITUTION’S FIVE-TIMES NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING FOOTBALL PROGRAM, THESE HAPPENIN’ JOCKS HAVE A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.* 

 

The players began undressing, shedding their helmets and jerseys, starting in on their pads. *Uh-oh*, Vic thought. *I don’t think I like where this is going.* 

 

Mercifully, the picture jumped forward, to present the players in their street clothes: hoodies, slacks and sneakers, plus a few gaudy chains. The camera zoomed between them, spotlighting what appeared to be their every used jockstrap, still wet with perspiration, piled atop a bench. 

 

The picture zoomed out, revealing three of the players dragging a skinny struggler to the loaded bench. His hands were tied behind his back. Ropes encircled his legs, so that he couldn’t properly walk, only shuffle. 

 

The text returned: *MEET MARTY* *MACNAMARA, AKA SOLOMON THE SQUID. THIS POOR LITTLE FELLOW THOUGHT THAT BY BECOMING EAST PACIFIC’S MASCOT, HE WOULD FINALLY LAND SOME FRIENDS. LOOK WHAT HE GOT FOR HIS EFFORTS.*

 

Out came a flying harness, presumably stolen from the school’s theatre department. Struggling, Marty was strapped into it. Soon, he was dangling from the ceiling, a living piñata. As he thrashed, his laughing tormentors looped their jockstraps over his arms and legs, until every undergarment adorned him. 

 

“Piñata, bitch!” one player shouted. “Whoever knocks the most straps off wins!” 

 

“Wins what?” another demanded. “Let’s make this shit interesting!”

 

“You’re right, muthafucka! Five bucks each, winner takes all! Ante up, homies!”

 

A pile of Lincolns grew upon a bench. After everybody contributed, a yardstick materialized. One by one, the players swung at the screaming Marty, collecting whatever jockstraps fell, as agony made their victim’s limbs spasm. Some seemed disinterested in the money, directing their swings against poor Marty’s face. 

 

Soon, every strap had fallen. The winner was a large Caucasian, who looked a decade older than any high schooler Vic had ever seen. As he collected his money, the camera panned back to the dangling Marty—his eyes swollen shut, blood dripping from his nose and lips. The pudgy filmer turned the camera around, mugging for his viewers. “East Pacific, bitch!” he barked. “Squids for life!”     

 

The screen went black; the text returned: *THAT POOR LITTLE DANGLER. REALIZE THIS: MARTY COULD BE ANY OF US, AND THUS WE MUST AVENGE HIM. BE ON THE BUS AT SIX A.M. TOMORROW. YOU’LL FIND IT PARKED JUST OUTSIDE OF THIS COMPLEX. MORE DETAILS TO FOLLOW.*

 

 Vic took the DVD out, and glared at it like it was a rabid animal. *Goddamn,* he thought. *I knew that something like this was coming. Time to take a ride, I guess.*

Then came the alarm clock, the bleary-eyed coffee slurps. Somebody had vacuumed up the dead flower petals, leaving behind one of those “speak no evil” surgical masks and a note: *PUT THIS ON AND COME ON DOWN. REMEMBER, VICTOR, SILENCE IS GOLDEN.*

 

As an afterthought, he grabbed a hoodie. *Should I bring the gun?* he wondered. *Nah, the note didn’t mention it.* 

 

Straddling the sidewalk was a vehicle that resembled a party bus, one repainted in drab, depressing hues. Vic climbed the steps. 

 

*Holy shit, it is a party bus—strobe lights, leather seats, and everything. Is that a stripper pole? Yeah, good luck getting this crowd to use it.* 

 

There were sixty-eight seats—sixty-nine, if one included the driver—and nearly all of them were taken. Beholding his supposed compatriots in their monkey-fingered masks, Vic shuddered. Here were the sad ones, the psychopaths, and the social rejects. Some had the wide, flagrant eyes of spree killers; others stared into their laps. Most dwelt outside society’s definition of beautiful, although a couple could have passed for models. Some were scarred; others were missing ears or fingers. Nobody spoke a word.     

 

Vic couldn’t be sure with the mask, but one of the passengers looked suspiciously like Marty MacNamara from the video. *Hey, wait a minute,* Vic thought. *How come we’re going after this guy’s bullies? What about my creepy-ass neighbors? I mean, what those two dudes had planned for me was way worse than some airborne beat down. I need to figure out who runs this thing, and put my name in the queue.*

 

He caught two eyes studying him—the girl from across the hall, with an empty seat beside her. Claiming it, Vic shot the girl a smile she couldn’t see. *Aw, what the hell?* he thought, grabbing her hand, giving it an affectionate squeeze. Her eyes went wide, but she didn’t pull her hand away. 

 

Vic wondered what making out with a tongueless chick would be like. His palm grew sweaty. *Man, I really need to learn her name.* 

 

At the sound of a buzzing motor, the girl jerked her hand away. Vic glanced up to see a robot rolling down the aisle, what looked like a Roomba fortified for frontline combat. Mounted atop it was a display screen, occupied by a grey, computer-generated face, devoid of race or gender.      

 

The pixelated countenance spoke, in a strange tone neither masculine nor effeminate. “*Welcome*,” it said. “*Today, we stand together, the Silent Minority. We are better than pointless killing sprees, better than the monsters that they pretend we are. It’s time for average citizens to learn the power of introverts united. It’s time to overthrow some jocks.”*

 

The robot voice paused. With any other audience, a cheer would have erupted. Instead, Vic heard a sneeze, a low cough, and the awkward sound of posteriors shifting on leather seats.

 

*“Now let’s keep this a surprise, shall we? You’ll learn your destination when we reach it, along with the mission objectives. For now, enjoy the ride. I’ll be visiting with each of you individually as we drive.”*

 

Compartments opened in the ceiling. Like airplane oxygen masks, a pair of headphones fell for each passenger. As the bus lurched into life, the robot wheeled over to a scrawny, scarecrow-resembling twitcher. Inserting his jack into the robot’s headphone port, the twitcher listened quietly. Still, nobody spoke.

 

Vic fought the urge to scream, to jump from seat to seat like a gorilla unbound. The mystery was getting to him. *Are we going for a prank or hospitalizations?* he wondered. *Is somebody going to die today?* It felt as if he’d binged on Starbucks. His heart beat like a string of firecrackers: pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

 

He knew that he wasn’t supposed to talk, but couldn’t resist whispering “hello” to his seatmate.

 

Glaring, she put a forefinger to her mask-concealed lips. So instead he pantomimed eating, shoveling his hands toward his mouth and patting his stomach. He gave her a thumbs-up. *Does she get that I’m thanking her for the food?* he wondered. 

 

The drive lasted ages. Vic wished that he had the window seat, to give him some idea of their destination. *Are we going to East Pacific High School, or somewhere else?* he wondered. *Where the fuck is East Pacific High School, anyway?* 

 

Eventually, the robot rolled over to Vic. When he plugged his headphones in, the grey face winked. *“Hello, Victor,”* it said. *“We are so glad that you decided to join us. Are you enjoying your apartment? Your old neighbors have stayed busy in your absence.”*

 

The face disappeared, replaced by words and footage. *REMEMBER KURT JANSSON, BROTHER OF THE RECENTLY DEPARTED KNUT? OF COURSE YOU DO. WELL, THE MAN SEEMS SOMEWHAT FIXATED ON YOU, VICTOR. LET’S CHECK IN WITH HIM, SHALL WE?*

 

The footage revealed a night-swallowed cemetery: teethlike headstones gleaming, protruding from ebon ocean. Amidst them, illuminated by three portable spotlights, a man dug up a fresh grave. The camera zoomed in, revealing Kurt’s familiar features. 

 

*Damn, they’re stalking this guy for me,* Vic realized. *That’s kind of…flattering.*

 

The hole grew large enough for Kurt to disappear down. The blade of his swinging shovel plunged down again and again, presumably battering a coffin. *Wait a minute, is that Knut’s grave? Is this weirdo looking for a family reunion? Holy mackerel.* 

 

But when Kurt emerged minutes later, the severed cranium that he clutched belonged to no man, but a young blonde woman, recently deceased. Her eyes were open, her lips pursed as if to kiss.  

 

*No fucking way. What the hell is going on with this dude? Is it a sex thing? Why is the Silent Minority even showing me this?*

 

The video cut to a filthy hotel room interior—dark-stained walls and carpet, vomit splattered across the bedspread and curtains. And there was Kurt, working with immaculate concentration. Utilizing a buck knife, he gently peeled the woman’s face from her skull, and then held it up for inspection. 

 

Vic had seen enough. He pulled out his headphones and shuttered his eyes. He didn’t know how the Silent Minority had gotten their camera into the hotel room, but it was obvious what they were up to. They wanted him overwhelmingly enraged, so that he’d go along with their little jockpocalypse without forethought. *Sometimes it’s better not to know,* he realized. *These people want me so focused on my sicko neighbors that I think of nothing else. They want me to see Kurt’s face on every jock we encounter, to make me all the more merciless. I’m hip to their bullshit, though. I’m not cutting off my tongue.*   

 

*“Victor Dickens, please reconnect your headphones!”* the robot blared. *“You’ve ignominies yet to witness.”*

 

Now the Silent were staring, wide-eyed, over their seats. Meekly, Vic plugged his headphones back in, and forced himself to watch the footage. It got worse. 

 

Kurt laughed and cried, ballroom dancing with an empty face. *Holy Buffalo Bill, this dude’s a weirdo,* Vic marveled. *What does he do on Christmas, build a tree of severed arms, with each hand clutching a blown glass ornament? He’s gonna wear the face, isn’t he? Just slip the thing on like a hockey mask. And what the hell happened to his wife and kid? Did they leave him? Did he kill them? Seriously, what the fuck?*

 

But the face wasn’t Kurt’s to wear. From the bathroom, the man retrieved a black-bristled, snouted struggler: a potbellied pig, grotesquely obese. From his suitcase, Kurt withdrew a needle and some suture thread. 

 

*Don’t do it, dude!* Vic wanted to scream. But it wouldn’t have mattered. Kurt stitched the corpse face over the pig’s face, leaving upright ears poking over a nightmare countenance. *At least there’s no sound. That pig’s gotta be screaming something terrible.* 

 

The scene cut to the interior of Vic’s abandoned residence. There was Kurt, setting his corpse-masked swine loose, to thump and bump its way across the living room. Exiting through a broken front door, Kurt left the terror-spurred animal to its ponderous rampage. The screen cut to black. The words returned:

 

*DON’T WORRY, VICTOR. WE RESCUED MISTER OINKS-A-LOT. IT WOULDN’T DO TO HAVE THE AUTHORITIES LOOKING INTO YOU, TO HAVE YOUR NAME HOLLERED ACROSS THE MEDIA BY AWFUL GHOULS LIKE NANNY GAINES. WE EVEN GOT THE FACE OFF, AND DONATED THAT POOR FELLER TO THE PIG PLACEMENT NETWORK. WE ALSO FIXED YOUR FRONT DOOR. YOU’RE WELCOME.*

 

*I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING. WHY BOTHER WITH A BUNCH OF HIGH SCHOOL JOCKSACKS WHEN WE HAVE SICKER FUCKS TO DEAL WITH? WHY NOT GO AFTER KURT OR YOUR TWO MUSTACHIOED ADMIRERS? WELL, BUDDY, OUR OPERATION WORKS AS A SORT OF MERITOCRACY. PROVE YOUR WORTH—YOUR COMPETENCY, COMMITMENT AND ABILITY—TO THE SILENT, AND THE SILENT WILL RISE UP IN YOUR DEFENSE. TODAY, YOU EARN OUR LOYALTY. MAKE US PROUD, VICTOR.* 

 

*YOU MAY DISCONNECT YOUR HEADPHONES NOW.*

 

Vic complied, and the robot rolled to his seatmate. As she plugged into her own personalized presentation, Vic tried to do the honorable thing and keep his eyes to himself. He lasted maybe five minutes.       

 

On the screen, he saw his neighbor. Her pixelated doppelganger appeared younger—eighteen or nineteen, Vic guessed—lying prone across an elderly man’s lap, pants down, exposing her cream-white posterior. With a leather belt, the man began spanking her, savagely, over and over again. Crimson lines split the cream, crisscrossing into scars that she probably still bore in the present. 

 

*Who is that guy?* Vic wondered, scrutinizing the white-haired spanker. *Her dad? Grandpa? Teacher? Gardener? What’s his problem? Is this some kind of sex thing? Is she being raped? I mean, look how angry he is. Who peed in his Cheerios?* 

 

The camera panned into his neighbor’s young face. As she voiced screams that he couldn’t hear, Vic realized that she’d still had her tongue then. *Did this dude cut it out, or did she do it herself, for the Silent Minority?* 

 

Embarrassed, he turned away, to study his neighbor’s current face. Her eyes streamed tears. Behind the surgical mask, her mouth had undoubtedly contorted into something terrible. 

 

*How can the Silent Minority do this to her?* Vic wondered. *How did they even get that footage? Forcing her to relieve that abuse is monstrous. She should be in therapy or something, not watching this shit. I should smash that robot, force the bus driver to pull over, and bring this girl back to Turquoise Street, away from all these creepy bastards. No, that wouldn’t work. My neighbors make that guy look like Mister Rogers.*  

 

Eventually, Beth’s presentation ended, and the robot wheeled over to a bespectacled, morbidly obese spinster. Vic’s seatmate made a sound, a sort of liquid bark. Hearing it shriveled Vic’s soul. *Fuck it,* he thought, pulling his mask down to kiss the girl’s cheek. 

 

Gently squeezing her arm, he whispered, “You’re not alone.” 

 

This time, she gave no admonishment. Instead, the girl rested her head against his shoulder, allowing Vic to throw an arm around her. They remained like that, like a couple of middle schoolers on their third date, until the bus stopped.   

 

Vic had expected to see a high school exterior, but instead found himself appraising a piss-yellow, single-story stretch of connected rooms. The motel faced the parking lot, with closed doors and shuttered windows hiding all present guests.       

 

The robot rolled backward, positioning itself at the front of the bus. *“Comrades, we’ve arrived,”* it announced. *“Allow me to introduce some new friends: Candy, Hester and Kelly Z. Come on in, girls.”* 

 

The door whooshed open, allowing three night ladies to stumble into sight. They wore fishnets, shiny leather skirts, hoop earrings, and fringe crop tops. Their teeth were bad, their faces prematurely aged. Still, they sported large fake breasts and inner thighs that could crack walnuts.   

 

*“For those of you wondering,”* the robot continued, *“these women are in fact prostitutes. Yes, they’ve already been paid for their services. In fact, these three vixens are going to help land us some jocks. Still, for those of you who’ve never touched a live female, and always wanted to, feel free to come forward and get your grope on.”*

 

About half of the passengers did. Both males and females stumbled forward with their eyes downcast, to squeeze breasts and backsides before shuffling back, embarrassed. The prostitutes looked ready to laugh and jeer, but retained their composure for the moment. 

 

*Aw, what the hell?* Vic thought. *I wouldn’t mind a fondle.* He began to rise, but then caught the neighbor girl staring. Her eyes said: *Please don’t. Please tell me that there’s at least one man alive who isn’t a heartless pervert. I need to believe in someone.* 

 

Vic sat back down.        

 

The robot continued. *“Now that we’ve gotten that out of our systems, let’s get back to business. Basically, if everything goes as planned, a fourth prostitute will arrive momentarily, bringing the entire East Pacific High football team with her. She visited their practice earlier, possibly showed a bit of tit, and invited them to a little ‘party.’* 

 

*“I know what you’re thinking. Aren’t these paragons of muscled mediocrity already dating cheerleaders and the like? Why would they need hookers? Well, let me drop a little robot knowledge on y’all. In high school, one’s hormones are at an all-time high. Ergo, whatever sex these Neanderthals are getting, it’s far from enough. Most of their girlfriends put out sparingly, anyway, as that is the only way to keep these cavemen in line.* 

 

*“Our girl’s going to offer them free sex, enough to go around. Any guy with objections is going to ignore them—if they don’t want to get ostracized by their teammates, that is. Even the closeted gay players will be forced to join in. Trust your friendly robot friend. This isn’t my first rodeo.*

 

*“Anyway, our quartet of professionals are going to roofie every jock for us. That’s right: Rohypnol, baby, the rapist’s drug of choice. How will they accomplish this? ‘Hey, who wants to take a shot of tequila out of my vagina? Step up, studs!’ Herd mentality will take care of the rest. Once the roofies kick in, you guys will enter the equation. More details to follow.”* 

 

Stumbling from the bus, the hookers disappeared into a rented room. Vic wished that he could follow them. Some minutes later, a yellow school bus pulled up—windows down, belching weed smoke into the atmosphere—filled with rambunctious shouters. 

 

*“Duck down; don’t let them see you,”* the robot demanded, and the Silent complied. Still, Vic couldn’t resist peeking out the window, to scope the new arrivals. Dressed in their chill clothes, an entire football team spilled onto the blacktop, just as the robot had predicted. With them was a fourth prostitute: an Amazonian African-American, the sexiest of the bunch. Together, they joined the other three professionals, and the door closed behind them. 

 

*“Wait for the signal,”* the robot insisted. 

 

Time passed, slowly, with many Silent scrutinizing their own palms, as if unable to believe that they’d grasped living, breathing women, however briefly. One guy went so far as to smell his hand, and then give it a cursory lick. *Good God, we’re pathetic,* Vic thought ruefully. *I’m surprised that nobody’s pocket-jerking right now. Or are they?* 

 

Finally, the door reopened. Kelly Z peeked out, shooting them a thumbs-up.

 

*“The time has come,”* the robot said. *“Everybody, grab a Taser on the way out. Four amongst you—raise your hands for identification, please—have been appointed to lead. The rest shall follow their example.”*

 

Filing past the bus driver, the Silent collected Tasers from the open cardboard box that he gripped, and then followed the leaders into the motel room. One leader carried the robot along.  

 

The room reeked of sweat, liquor, vomit, and high-grade pot. It was so people-stuffed that there was scarcely room to stand. 

 

They found the football players sprawled and giggling, attempting to rise, but lacking the proper coordination and muscle control. Three of the four hookers were dressed, with the fourth too intent on fingering herself to realize that their job was finished. Her labia resembled cold cuts tenderized with a ball-peen hammer, then liberally sprinkled with genital warts. *Gross*, Vic thought. 

 

“Hey, who invited the freak show?” one jock shouted, eliciting laughter from his comrades. 

 

“Why’s it smell like virgin all of a sudden?” another asked. 

 

The robot’s speakers blared, replaying the roar of thousands of sports spectators, undoubtedly recorded at one bowl game or another. A referee’s whistle sounded, shrill and monstrous. 

 

“The fuck?” one jock asked. “Wha’ you faggots doin’?” Three players had already nodded off, so the leaders blasted them with electrodes, Taser-shocking them back into semi-consciousness.

 

*“Greetings, Squids,”* the robot enthused. *“You were not aware of it, but today is the Day of the Introvert. To begin with, we ask that you remove your clothing.”* 

 

“Fuck you!” the players shouted, along with much slurred speculation concerning the Silent Minority’s sexuality.

 

*We’re making them get naked?* Vic wondered. *That seems so…gay. Can’t we just beat the shit out of them, and leave it at that? This isn’t gonna turn into some kind of dropped soap opera, is it?* 

 

“It’s like…shit…uh…” a linebacker slurred. 

 

*“Take your clothes off,”* the robot ordered. 

 

The fourth hooker had finally gotten the hint. Now dressed, she touched the bus driver’s shoulder and said, “Hey, we’re takin’ off. I mean…this is pretty fucked up, guy. We did what you wanted, didn’t we?”

 

The bus driver nodded. Watching the women file out of the room, Vic felt his stomach lurch. *I shouldn’t be here. This is…wrong.* 

 

Though confused and dizzy, struggling with simple motor skills, the football team remained defiant. “I’ll fuck you up,” one promised. Noticing a shapely Silent Minority female, he said, “Hey, dis one’s a bitch. Come here, baby. I gotta present for ya.” He pointed at his genitals. 

 

The girl walked over, leaned down, and shocked the proffered package. The jock screamed, thick and clotted. His torment was like blood in the water, and soon introverts were Taser-blasting every jock present. Some went so far as to throw punches and kicks, most being feebly delivered. 

 

The players flopped and convulsed, swore and mumbled. Vic just watched, feeling as if he should care about somebody, anybody. He didn’t want to hurt the jocks or assist them. He only wanted to leave. *Was there ever such a thing as morality?* he wondered. *Or did some starry-eyed writer just imagine it?*    

 

*“Take off their clothes,”* the robot ordered. *“Take off their clothes, and prop them so they’re standing. We can’t stay here forever.”*

 

The Silent complied. Soon, nearly fifty players—first, second, and third-string—were pushed against the far wall, unsteady on their feet, waving and swaying to inebriated inner rhythms. All were nude. Blinking furiously, they gaped and gasped, attempting to focus their thoughts. 

 

On the robot’s display screen, the face shifted from grey to a furious red. Growing thick ebon horns, it became a cartoonish Beelzebub countenance. Its voice changed as well, becoming demonic: dozens of agonized utterances intermingled.  

 

*“HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?”* it asked the inebriated. *“NAKED, HUMILIATED, BRUISED AND BLEARY. WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH YOU? PERHAPS YOU’D LIKE TO DANGLE FOR A WHILE, JUST LIKE YOUR BUDDY MARTY. NO, THAT WOULDN’T MAKE OUR POINT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THERE’S ONE THING THAT WE AT THE SILENT MINORITY BELIEVE IN, IT’S SCHOOL SPIRIT. ISN’T THAT RIGHT, COMRADES?”*

 

As one, the Silent nodded—even Vic. Not that he’d ever cared about any school, but he was becoming hip to the robot’s showmanship. He knew that the little contraption was building up to something. 

 

*“I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU SO-CALLED ATHLETES. GIVE US ONE GOOD ROUND OF YOUR EAST PACIFIC FIGHT SONG AND WE’LL LET YOU GO. YOU MORONS MUST’VE BELCHED IT A THOUSAND TIMES BY NOW, SO WE EXPECT YOU TO ARTICULATE.”*

 

The Squids laughed and grumbled. Some shouted slurred threats. “Eat my dick, robo-faggot!” one yelled. 

 

*“SUCH HOMOPHOBIA. BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOU’RE THE ONE STANDING NAKED IN A CLUSTER OF DUDES. OBVIOUSLY, YOU’RE INTO IT, OR ELSE YOU FUCKERS WOULD HAVE MADE WITH THE LYRICS ALREADY, SO THAT WE CAN ALL GO HOME.”*

 

But the players weren’t having it. And so the four Silent leaders momentarily disappeared. Returning, each clutched a shotgun, pointed authoritatively forward. 

 

*Oh, shit,* Vic thought. *Am I about to view some burst craniums? Should I just start running—somewhere, anywhere—before I become complicit in this bizarre torture scenario? Ah, whatever.* 

 

*“LAST CHANCE,”* the robot bellowed. *“SING YOUR FIGHT SONG NOW!”* 

 

No dice. And so the four leaders fired, deafening in the room’s close quarters. Four jocks flew backward, toppling the rest over like dominoes. But there was no blood, just angry thoracic blotches, which would soon shift to purple, signifying broken ribs. The players screamed and bellowed, and had to be helped back to their feet. 

 

*“THAT’S RIGHT, FUCKERS. THESE HERE SHOTGUNS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO FIRE BEANBAG ROUNDS: TINY PILLOWS FILLED WITH BIRDSHOT. THEY MIGHT NOT KILL YOU, BUT THEY SURE HURT LIKE THE DEVIL. THAT OL’ SING-ALONG DOESN’T SEEM SO BAD NOW, DOES IT? AND A ONE, AND A TWO…”*

 

There came a bit of mumbling and humming, some slurred something or other. 

 

*“C’MON, SQUIDS! Y’ALL CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT! HERE, WHY DON’T I GET YOU STARTED? PURPLE-GREY, OBLITERATE. PURPLE-GREY, THE BEST IN STATE…YOU KNOW THE REST.”*

 

Finally, they performed the fight song. The lyrics, as Vic understood them, went as follows:

 

*Purple-grey, obliterate*

*Purple-grey, the best in state*

*With pride we fight for glory true*

*In sunny skies, in oceans blue*

*Rah, rah, rah, we take the field*

*Go, team, go, with sword and shield*

*EPHS charge!*

 

They looked so stupid there, swaying with their chill-shriveled dongs out, chanting those asinine lyrics. When Vic noticed the four Silent leaders recording the performance with their cellphones, understanding finally dawned. The footage would leak out, and the group would be slandered mercilessly, to the point where they’d think twice before bashing any more human piñatas. 

 

*Well, that’s not so bad, all things considered,* Vic thought. *Man, I thought we’d spend the evening dissolving bodies, or maybe digging out desert graves.* He began to laugh, his mirth quickly terminated by the glares of the Silent. *Man, these dudes really can’t stand human articulations. Maybe I should learn how to talk like that kooky multiple personality robot. Yeah, maybe.* 

 

Having finished their chant, the Squids stood staring slackly. The robot’s countenance receded from the devilish, back into the genderless grey it had started out as. Its speaker-projected voice returned to normal, speaking conciliatorily now: *“Gee, that wasn’t so bad, was it? Had you fellas been so accommodating to begin with, we might have spared ourselves some unpleasantness. Go ahead, get dressed.”*

 

With assistance from the Silent Minority, the jocks concealed their shame. Some of them had the wrong clothes on—too baggy, or slut-tight—but at least their horrible tan lines were gone. 

 

*“We hope that you learned something today,”* the robot said. *“No longer shall the Silent suffer meekly. Remember that factoid in the days to come. Your hateful bullying brought you here, nothing else. Thuggish savagery demands retribution, now and forevermore. The Day of the Introvert shall sprout into an era.*

 

*“Hang around for a while, until one of you has sobered up enough to drive. We wouldn’t want your team to die in a fiery bus crash, ha-ha. Goodbye, friends. Don’t make us pay you another visit.”*

 

As the Silent began exiting, one of them darted forward, shedding his “speak no evil” mask. *Oh, I knew it,* Vic thought. *That’s totally Marty MacNamara.* 

 

“Remember me?” Marty inquired with a cracking shout. His face appeared to thin and stretch, until it seemed to Vic that something demonic peered out of those tormented eye sockets. From his pocket, Marty pulled a butterfly knife, fanning it open single-handedly. Before anybody could think to react, he rushed the nearest player. 

 

*Jab* the knife went, into a Samoan’s carotid. Hand to his neck, the jock face-slapped the floor. Marty screamed triumphantly, and actually licked the blood from his blade before rushing a mulleted ginger, who must have weighted a quarter ton. *Jab, jab, jab,* and a fleshy abdomen became confetti. The ginger screamed, his screeches echoed by his teammates as the Silent fell upon Marty, and wrestled him out of the room. 

 

*Should I call an ambulance?* Vic wondered. In his mind, two Vic-selves argued—the guy he’d been and whatever Vic was becoming. *Nah, fuck ’em. Let those malevolent jerks bleed out.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

During the return drive, the robot paid each Silent Minority member a second visit. It seemed like overkill, but what could Vic do?

 

At any rate, he was presented with more footage shot within his erstwhile residence. Two men, vaguely familiar, ransacked cupboards and closets, floor-strewing their contents. 

 

“We’ll search for twenty minutes,” a balding man with an overbite declared. His voice identified him as Bill, already twice recorded plotting against Vic. *Three strikes, you’re out, Bill.*  

 

“Yeah, what if we find something?” his beanie-wearing accomplice asked. 

 

“That faggot will get a fair trial. Fair, as long as it ends with him in prison or a fuckin’ madhouse.”

 

Mercifully, that short bit seemed to be all that the robot had left. *I wonder what those douchebags were looking for*, Vic thought. *Proof of Knut’s murder? Or have they convinced themselves that I’m guilty of some other crime? That neighborhood’s obsession with me is all kinds of pathetic. Seriously, we need to swerve this bus toward Turquoise Street. Skin those fucks alive.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Though somewhat disappointed, Vic wasn’t surprised to glance down the next morning and discover his doorstep vacant. *That across-the-hall girl is probably too traumatized to cook*, he realized. *I mean, shit, between the horrible footage that robot made her watch and the violence of the jock takedown, she’s probably curled up in the fetal position right now, sobbing like a side-speared sea lion. Luckily, I’m made of sterner stuff.* 

 

He spent the day channel surfing, flipping through newscast after newscast, wondering how their assault would be reported. Hours later, he struck gold. 

 

There was Erin Rodriguez, XBC News, she of the power suit and bob cut. The reporter was somewhat of a celebrity, having broken the story of the Minnesota Corpse Shack a year prior. Now she stood before an institution, whose painted exterior bore the words *EAST PACIFIC HIGH SCHOOL*, beneath which an anthropomorphized purple squid smiled sinisterly. Battling her own burgeoning smirk, the woman attempted a serious demeanor. 

 

“I’m reporting live from East Pacific High School,” she announced, “home to the Squids, football players struggling to live up to their five-times National Championship winning predecessors. 

 

“Last night, this talented group of young athletes faced its greatest challenge yet, far from the gridiron. That’s right, in a tragic turn of events that has left this SoCal community reeling, the entire team was abducted and brutalized by the terrorist group, al-Qaeda.”

 

Had Vic been drinking anything at that moment, it would have gone spraying from his face, replicating insipid sitcom slapstick. *Al-Qaeda?* he thought. *How the hell did they get the credit?*     

 

“The assault resulted in two deaths: Aiono Palamo and Buford ‘Pellet’ Littleton, both of whom succumbed to violent stabbings. Our hearts go out to their families and friends, as their shock segues to mourning. 

 

“Worse, a video hit the Internet, hours ago, featuring the entire team naked and terrified, forced to sing their school fight song.” XBC then aired a brief clip of a performance Vic had caught live—with the genitals fortunately blurred, unlike the video that the Silent had leaked on Skewlclips. “I’m here with star cornerback, Javon Johns. Javon, what can you tell us about your experience?”

 

Javon stumbled forward, his eyes red and lidded between a Kangol and a turtleneck. Whether his blurred oculi stemmed from roofie remnants or fresh blunt sucking, Vic didn’t care to speculate.

 

“Aw, it was crazy,” Javon mumbled. “Niggas run up on us, be like sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, nahm saying? Dudes rocking turbans, waving them AKs, straight thuggin’. Before I knew it, they had us all staggered, like trippin’ over our shoes and shit.”

 

“And what of your slain teammates, Aiono Palamo and Buford Littleton?”

 

“Man, on the real, shit was tragic. I mean…I seen them sliced, man, crazy style. Them’s my peoples, nahm sayin’? Like, I’d have jumped into the mix, fucked them towelheads up, but my mind…it wasn’t workin’ right.”

 

“Yes, apparently the toxicologist found Rohypnol in your urine samples. Tell me, Javon, how did al-Qaeda manage to get an entire football team roofied?”

 

“I can’t remember, yo. I remember football practice, and then…it’s like…nothin’, nah mean? Next thing I know, shit’s straight up bin Laden.”    

 

“Thank you, Javon.” 

 

Vic switched off the TV. 

 

*Seriously?* he thought. *How the hell do you mistake a bunch of geeks in surgical masks for al-Qaeda? Were the roofies that strong? Or is this some kind of face saving dealie? Did the team decide that blaming it on Middle Easterners made them look less pussified? I mean, the whole world’s seen ’em singing with their dicks out. It’s not like they’ll ever live that down, no matter how they try to spin it. Or did XBC News make up the story, desperate for ratings? It doesn’t make sense.* 

 

*Seriously, I thought we were supposed to be sending a message: introverts have united, and will no longer stand for victimization against our kind. Now what? What was the point of it all? If anything, our actions will now lead to some poor immigrants getting jumped. Who’s running this show, anyway?*",1,1770912852.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1r2xltv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1r2xltv/help_fighting_cats/,Help! Fighting cats!,"Hi guys! I really need help and any advice would be appreciated. I have two cats (gizmo and gadget, almost 2y/o and both female). I’ve had them since they were both 8 weeks old and they are litter mates. They have been best friends ever since. A few months ago, I also got two ferrets. The ferrets and them get along and they play often. Yesterday, I did my usual morning routine by letting the ferrets out to play for a bit and started making my coffee. When all of a sudden I heard one of the cats start meowing in distress.

When I looked, gizmo had made her way into the ferret cage and was on the third floor of it on the inside. Gadget was on top of the cage on the outside and it seemed like she was yelling at gizmo. When I took gizmo out of the cage, gadget just attacked gizmo and started chasing her all around my apartment. Gizmo got scared and went and hid on top of the fridge and I tried to grab gadget but she was hissing at me and even swatted at me (which she has never done!) I was able to lure her into my bedroom to separate them and that’s where she’s been ever since yesterday.

Gizmo calmed down and returned to her sweet self and wanted love and kisses as usual. Gadget, however, wants nothing to do with me. Whenever I go into my bedroom, I’m terrified. She hisses, growls, swats at me with her claws. Complete and total switch up from her usual sweet self. She’s never aggressive, ever. This morning, I tried opening the door a bit so they could see each other. Gizmo (the cat who was attacked) then got mad at me and started hissing at me because she thought I was going to let her out. When I went into the bedroom, gadget is still hissing and growling at me!

I don’t know what to do. I’m stressed and have never been in this situation before. These two were best friends. I thought maybe gizmo got the ferret scent on her and that’s why gadget freaked out but I have no clue. My best friend, who is a vet tech, suggested we get a crate with litter and food and put it in the living room with gadget inside so gizmo and her can get used to each other again. I’m just worried about another cat fight. If you have tips, suggestions or anything that may help me out, please let me know! Im desperate.",1,1770912845.0,CatAdvice,3,1.0,False
1r2xlr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1r2xlr3/our_abuser_is_seeing_some_karma_for_everything/,Our abuser is seeing some karma for everything they did.,"I 27NB, found out this past week from a close friend that my and my current partner’s 30M, abuser 35F is finally getting the karma they deserve after two years. 

For some backstory, I met my now partner three years ago, we met online though a polyamory group. And what’s so sad is we all hit it off. The three of us just clicked  instantly. Little did I know that one of them would turn out to be an abuser and rapist. 

Over the next year I would spend getting to know them and growing to love them both. As well in that time I also began to face her abuse not even a full six months after getting into a relationship with the two of them. 

There is a level of guilt to all of this, a sense of feeling tricked. But it’s all self blame. I’d been in an abusive relationship before, I knew the signs. Yet I went in blissful and near willfully ignorant. Anyways, a year later, it all came to a head when I was chased out of the house. I wasn’t living there, however this had been a weekend where we had planned for a throuple weekend and outings. We had been planning to go to this big outdoor event that was two days long, in a mountain valley, where you had to hike and camp to be there. We’d all been very excited for it. However the weather for our region got unusually hot, on top of the fact it had downpoured in that area all week. We would have had to hike at least 300-450 pounds of gear/equipment up a hot, wet and mud-slicked mountain into a boggy marsh. The whole night before day 1 of this event we debated how we’d go about doing this. I and my partner were in agreement that we should leave all the unessential stuff behind, make the trek for day 1, but instead of camping like we planned, we come back down, regroup and see what day 2 holds, and if we decided to go back. However our abuser wasn’t having any of it. She was being the kind of unreasonable that I can only describe as explosive and illogical. She wouldn’t hear any of our ideas out, didn’t want to hear about how the path everyone has to take will be horrid if we aren't the first ones there, on top of the fact our stuff would be too heavy to actually carry up, because we lost the use of our wagon due to the weather, which that she did acknowledge. Finally after it had gotten so late we thought she’d seen what we were saying and understood that it wasn’t canceling the trip or event, just some stuff had to be changed for all of our comfort. We were wrong. That next day she went on an epic tirade about everything. Saying we were scheming against her and just spouting awful things about us. Stupidly when I tried to comfort her or just talk to her, she began beating me with her laptop and chased me out of the house. She attacked our partner with a broken coffee cup and chased him out too. We didn’t call the cops on her then, but that was the beginning of the end. It all began to escalate from there, she became wildly more violent and manipulative, starting fighting over everything. She at one point came to my house and scared my then roommate, almost lost my home because of that. 

Not a month later she attacked both of us again, I wont describe that here but it was very bad and thankfully we at the time were close enough to a hospital. We did call the cops on her then and she was arrested. From there we went into a lengthy court battle with her. Her and my partner were legally married and had to get divorced, that she made a living hell, all while stalking and harassing me. She did the classic abuser things, went to our friend groups and told them all a wild story and made herself the victim. Luckily only a few people stuck with her and refused to actually hear what was going on, while the majority of our friends didn’t believe her. She also called a girlfriend of hers who lives across the country from us, flew out just to show up at court, but couldn’t actually do anything. Then suddenly that girlfriend disappeared, came to find out the ex was abusing that girl too and she ran for the hills. 

Finally this past fall all of the court stuff ended. I ended up having to take her to court for the stalking because it had gotten to the point where she had convinced a group of her friends to follow me around, specifically once incident during a festival that was really bad. I got very lucky there because security found out, and called the cops on all of them. Now the courts didn’t totally go in our favor. The divorce went well, none of her manipulative tactics worked there. However with my court case against her it didn’t go in my favor. I didn’t have enough evidence of the almost two years at that point, of stalking. I did but she covered her tracks well enough that some of it couldn’t be concluded to be her, but we know it was. Her group of friends came to court willingly but lied through their teeth even with video evidence. She also had a new boyfriend with her that was all too willing to stand at her side, spew lies in her defence and get called out for it in the court room several times. The crappy side bar here is, the judge who ruled in favor of my ex went on to retire 2 months later. That judge had a lot of complaints filed against them and I sadly was just a casualty of their incompetence. 

Now here we are months later haven’t heard anything and have been doing much better, in the end we moved out of the city she was in, a few hours away. A buddy of mine hit me up during this past week, not unusual, during this conversation she let me know some stuff. She was a witness and was involved during a lot of the court stuff so it makes sense that she still cares, this person, my ex, is a danger to the community we are a part of and we want to protect our friends if we can. So she lets me know of some stuff she’d heard through the grape vine. And although I was failed in courts, the universe is making sure my ex gets some karma and justice. Not a lot, and she could use much more, but I’m not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

So my friend tells me that my ex’s boyfriend left her shortly after all the court stuff concluded, filed his own restraining order against her and won. Part of why I felt like posting all of this is that, man I do not feel an ounce of guilt or sympathy for that dude. He stood in court for days and lied, he was a part of the stalking and harassment. I know I shouldn’t feel that way, but in the end he got what he deserved. And so did she. My friend told me some more stuff I wont share here, but yeah, the universe gave me a little reassurance that karma is a thing. ",2,1770912841.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.75,False

And weird they got. Vic returned to find his Silent doorstep drowning in flower petals—rose, tulip and hydrangea. *Please, please, please let these be from that girl across the hall. Don’t let those mustache dudes know about this place.* 

 

He went online. There was no Internet jack in his apartment, but a wireless router broadcasted from somewhere within the building. Scrolling through his favorite websites—Ain’t It Cool News, Newsarama and *The Onion*—he comprehended none of what he read. His thoughts kept circling around to his real home, pondering what his neighbors would come up with next. 

 

*I know that the Silent Minority has hidden cameras monitoring my house. I wonder if they’d let me tap into their feed. But how do I ask them? They gave me no email address, no phone number to call. I’m supposed to wait for contact, but when the hell will that be?*   

 

For a moment, his mind flashed upon a classic *Twilight Zone* episode, “People Are Alike All Over.” *Is that what’s happening? Am I an exhibit in a human zoo? Is this wall gonna slide sideways, revealing a crowd of cackling gawkers?* 

 

*Tomorrow*, he promised himself. *I’ll solve this mystery tomorrow.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

The next morning, he found the doorstep flower petals dead. Upon them, a serving tray rested, populated with three domed dishes, which turned out to be Korean barbecue short ribs, corn on the cob, and grits. 

 

*Kind of a strange breakfast combination,* Vic thought. But when he began eating, everything made sense. *Holy shit, that’s good. Like…crazy good. Who is this chick anyway, some traumatized master chef? Is it too early to propose marriage?* 

 

He ate and ate, moaning contentedly, his shirt catching errant splatter. An entire family-sized meal went down his gullet, leaving Vic barely able to waddle to the couch. 

 

Too stuffed to investigate, he decided to give the mystery another day. Or two.  

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Stealthy footsteps, a door opening and closing—sounds which drew Vic from bed just past two A.M. Bypassing a cardboard envelope left on the entryway floor, he raced into the hallway. Its single bulb was out; all was dark. He saw a shadow sliding on shadows, and heard the stairwell door being hurled open. 

 

“Wait a minute!” he hollered, pursuing the intruder halfway down the stairs. Realizing that he was wearing only boxers, fearful of looking like a sex maniac, he aborted the chase.

 

Instead, he went back inside to give the envelope the ol’ pick-and-rip. It contained a recordable DVD with the words *WATCH ME* scribbled on it. *Thanks for the suggestion,* Vic thought sarcastically. *Otherwise, I might have tried flossing my teeth with it.* 

 

Reclining on the couch, his eyes crusted and sleep-swollen, he watched the video. It began with a text scroll, just like the *Star Wars* films. 

 

*HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF SKEWLCLIPS?* it asked. *IT’S A CROSS BETWEEN YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK, A SITE WHEREIN FRIEND GROUPS SHARE VIDEO CLIPS FEATURING THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS. SINCE THE SITE IS UNMONITORED, AND ONLY PREAPPROVED FRIENDS CAN WATCH THE VIDEOS, AN ANYTHING GOES MENTALITY HAS INFECTED IT. NOW, THE MOST POPULAR CLIPS INVOLVE BULLYING.*

 

*HOW DO WE KNOW THIS? WE CRACKED THE CODE WIDE OPEN. GHOSTLIKE, WE NOW DRIFT FROM ONE PEER GROUP TO THE NEXT, IDENTIFYING THE BIGGEST BULLIES, REPLAYING THEIR CRIMES AGAINST OUR KIND IN PIXEL PANORAMAS. HERE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS:*

 

The video featured a group of football players entering a locker room. Their purple and grey uniforms were grass-stained and sweat-soaked. Presumably, they’d just left the field.  

 

*MEET EAST PACIFIC HIGH SCHOOL’S FAMOUS FOOTBALL TEAM, THE SQUIDS*, the text read. *AS THE LATEST ITERATION OF THE INSTITUTION’S FIVE-TIMES NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING FOOTBALL PROGRAM, THESE HAPPENIN’ JOCKS HAVE A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.* 

 

The players began undressing, shedding their helmets and jerseys, starting in on their pads. *Uh-oh*, Vic thought. *I don’t think I like where this is going.* 

 

Mercifully, the picture jumped forward, to present the players in their street clothes: hoodies, slacks and sneakers, plus a few gaudy chains. The camera zoomed between them, spotlighting what appeared to be their every used jockstrap, still wet with perspiration, piled atop a bench. 

 

The picture zoomed out, revealing three of the players dragging a skinny struggler to the loaded bench. His hands were tied behind his back. Ropes encircled his legs, so that he couldn’t properly walk, only shuffle. 

 

The text returned: *MEET MARTY* *MACNAMARA, AKA SOLOMON THE SQUID. THIS POOR LITTLE FELLOW THOUGHT THAT BY BECOMING EAST PACIFIC’S MASCOT, HE WOULD FINALLY LAND SOME FRIENDS. LOOK WHAT HE GOT FOR HIS EFFORTS.*

 

Out came a flying harness, presumably stolen from the school’s theatre department. Struggling, Marty was strapped into it. Soon, he was dangling from the ceiling, a living piñata. As he thrashed, his laughing tormentors looped their jockstraps over his arms and legs, until every undergarment adorned him. 

 

“Piñata, bitch!” one player shouted. “Whoever knocks the most straps off wins!” 

 

“Wins what?” another demanded. “Let’s make this shit interesting!”

 

“You’re right, muthafucka! Five bucks each, winner takes all! Ante up, homies!”

 

A pile of Lincolns grew upon a bench. After everybody contributed, a yardstick materialized. One by one, the players swung at the screaming Marty, collecting whatever jockstraps fell, as agony made their victim’s limbs spasm. Some seemed disinterested in the money, directing their swings against poor Marty’s face. 

 

Soon, every strap had fallen. The winner was a large Caucasian, who looked a decade older than any high schooler Vic had ever seen. As he collected his money, the camera panned back to the dangling Marty—his eyes swollen shut, blood dripping from his nose and lips. The pudgy filmer turned the camera around, mugging for his viewers. “East Pacific, bitch!” he barked. “Squids for life!”     

 

The screen went black; the text returned: *THAT POOR LITTLE DANGLER. REALIZE THIS: MARTY COULD BE ANY OF US, AND THUS WE MUST AVENGE HIM. BE ON THE BUS AT SIX A.M. TOMORROW. YOU’LL FIND IT PARKED JUST OUTSIDE OF THIS COMPLEX. MORE DETAILS TO FOLLOW.*

 

 Vic took the DVD out, and glared at it like it was a rabid animal. *Goddamn,* he thought. *I knew that something like this was coming. Time to take a ride, I guess.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Then came the alarm clock, the bleary-eyed coffee slurps. Somebody had vacuumed up the dead flower petals, leaving behind one of those “speak no evil” surgical masks and a note: *PUT THIS ON AND COME ON DOWN. REMEMBER, VICTOR, SILENCE IS GOLDEN.*

 

As an afterthought, he grabbed a hoodie. *Should I bring the gun?* he wondered. *Nah, the note didn’t mention it.* 

 

Straddling the sidewalk was a vehicle that resembled a party bus, one repainted in drab, depressing hues. Vic climbed the steps. 

 

*Holy shit, it is a party bus—strobe lights, leather seats, and everything. Is that a stripper pole? Yeah, good luck getting this crowd to use it.* 

 

There were sixty-eight seats—sixty-nine, if one included the driver—and nearly all of them were taken. Beholding his supposed compatriots in their monkey-fingered masks, Vic shuddered. Here were the sad ones, the psychopaths, and the social rejects. Some had the wide, flagrant eyes of spree killers; others stared into their laps. Most dwelt outside society’s definition of beautiful, although a couple could have passed for models. Some were scarred; others were missing ears or fingers. Nobody spoke a word.     

 

Vic couldn’t be sure with the mask, but one of the passengers looked suspiciously like Marty MacNamara from the video. *Hey, wait a minute,* Vic thought. *How come we’re going after this guy’s bullies? What about my creepy-ass neighbors? I mean, what those two dudes had planned for me was way worse than some airborne beat down. I need to figure out who runs this thing, and put my name in the queue.*

 

He caught two eyes studying him—the girl from across the hall, with an empty seat beside her. Claiming it, Vic shot the girl a smile she couldn’t see. *Aw, what the hell?* he thought, grabbing her hand, giving it an affectionate squeeze. Her eyes went wide, but she didn’t pull her hand away. 

 

Vic wondered what making out with a tongueless chick would be like. His palm grew sweaty. *Man, I really need to learn her name.* 

 

At the sound of a buzzing motor, the girl jerked her hand away. Vic glanced up to see a robot rolling down the aisle, what looked like a Roomba fortified for frontline combat. Mounted atop it was a display screen, occupied by a grey, computer-generated face, devoid of race or gender.      

 

The pixelated countenance spoke, in a strange tone neither masculine nor effeminate. “*Welcome*,” it said. “*Today, we stand together, the Silent Minority. We are better than pointless killing sprees, better than the monsters that they pretend we are. It’s time for average citizens to learn the power of introverts united. It’s time to overthrow some jocks.”*

 

The robot voice paused. With any other audience, a cheer would have erupted. Instead, Vic heard a sneeze, a low cough, and the awkward sound of posteriors shifting on leather seats.

 

*“Now let’s keep this a surprise, shall we? You’ll learn your destination when we reach it, along with the mission objectives. For now, enjoy the ride. I’ll be visiting with each of you individually as we drive.”*

 

Compartments opened in the ceiling. Like airplane oxygen masks, a pair of headphones fell for each passenger. As the bus lurched into life, the robot wheeled over to a scrawny, scarecrow-resembling twitcher. Inserting his jack into the robot’s headphone port, the twitcher listened quietly. Still, nobody spoke.

 

Vic fought the urge to scream, to jump from seat to seat like a gorilla unbound. The mystery was getting to him. *Are we going for a prank or hospitalizations?* he wondered. *Is somebody going to die today?* It felt as if he’d binged on Starbucks. His heart beat like a string of firecrackers: pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

 

He knew that he wasn’t supposed to talk, but couldn’t resist whispering “hello” to his seatmate.

 

Glaring, she put a forefinger to her mask-concealed lips. So instead he pantomimed eating, shoveling his hands toward his mouth and patting his stomach. He gave her a thumbs-up. *Does she get that I’m thanking her for the food?* he wondered. 

 

The drive lasted ages. Vic wished that he had the window seat, to give him some idea of their destination. *Are we going to East Pacific High School, or somewhere else?* he wondered. *Where the fuck is East Pacific High School, anyway?* 

 

Eventually, the robot rolled over to Vic. When he plugged his headphones in, the grey face winked. *“Hello, Victor,”* it said. *“We are so glad that you decided to join us. Are you enjoying your apartment? Your old neighbors have stayed busy in your absence.”*

 

The face disappeared, replaced by words and footage. *REMEMBER KURT JANSSON, BROTHER OF THE RECENTLY DEPARTED KNUT? OF COURSE YOU DO. WELL, THE MAN SEEMS SOMEWHAT FIXATED ON YOU, VICTOR. LET’S CHECK IN WITH HIM, SHALL WE?*

 

The footage revealed a night-swallowed cemetery: teethlike headstones gleaming, protruding from ebon ocean. Amidst them, illuminated by three portable spotlights, a man dug up a fresh grave. The camera zoomed in, revealing Kurt’s familiar features. 

 

*Damn, they’re stalking this guy for me,* Vic realized. *That’s kind of…flattering.*

 

The hole grew large enough for Kurt to disappear down. The blade of his swinging shovel plunged down again and again, presumably battering a coffin. *Wait a minute, is that Knut’s grave? Is this weirdo looking for a family reunion? Holy mackerel.* 

 

But when Kurt emerged minutes later, the severed cranium that he clutched belonged to no man, but a young blonde woman, recently deceased. Her eyes were open, her lips pursed as if to kiss.  

 

*No fucking way. What the hell is going on with this dude? Is it a sex thing? Why is the Silent Minority even showing me this?*

 

The video cut to a filthy hotel room interior—dark-stained walls and carpet, vomit splattered across the bedspread and curtains. And there was Kurt, working with immaculate concentration. Utilizing a buck knife, he gently peeled the woman’s face from her skull, and then held it up for inspection. 

 

Vic had seen enough. He pulled out his headphones and shuttered his eyes. He didn’t know how the Silent Minority had gotten their camera into the hotel room, but it was obvious what they were up to. They wanted him overwhelmingly enraged, so that he’d go along with their little jockpocalypse without forethought. *Sometimes it’s better not to know,* he realized. *These people want me so focused on my sicko neighbors that I think of nothing else. They want me to see Kurt’s face on every jock we encounter, to make me all the more merciless. I’m hip to their bullshit, though. I’m not cutting off my tongue.*   

 

*“Victor Dickens, please reconnect your headphones!”* the robot blared. *“You’ve ignominies yet to witness.”*

 

Now the Silent were staring, wide-eyed, over their seats. Meekly, Vic plugged his headphones back in, and forced himself to watch the footage. It got worse. 

 

Kurt laughed and cried, ballroom dancing with an empty face. *Holy Buffalo Bill, this dude’s a weirdo,* Vic marveled. *What does he do on Christmas, build a tree of severed arms, with each hand clutching a blown glass ornament? He’s gonna wear the face, isn’t he? Just slip the thing on like a hockey mask. And what the hell happened to his wife and kid? Did they leave him? Did he kill them? Seriously, what the fuck?*

 

But the face wasn’t Kurt’s to wear. From the bathroom, the man retrieved a black-bristled, snouted struggler: a potbellied pig, grotesquely obese. From his suitcase, Kurt withdrew a needle and some suture thread. 

 

*Don’t do it, dude!* Vic wanted to scream. But it wouldn’t have mattered. Kurt stitched the corpse face over the pig’s face, leaving upright ears poking over a nightmare countenance. *At least there’s no sound. That pig’s gotta be screaming something terrible.* 

 

The scene cut to the interior of Vic’s abandoned residence. There was Kurt, setting his corpse-masked swine loose, to thump and bump its way across the living room. Exiting through a broken front door, Kurt left the terror-spurred animal to its ponderous rampage. The screen cut to black. The words returned:

 

*DON’T WORRY, VICTOR. WE RESCUED MISTER OINKS-A-LOT. IT WOULDN’T DO TO HAVE THE AUTHORITIES LOOKING INTO YOU, TO HAVE YOUR NAME HOLLERED ACROSS THE MEDIA BY AWFUL GHOULS LIKE NANNY GAINES. WE EVEN GOT THE FACE OFF, AND DONATED THAT POOR FELLER TO THE PIG PLACEMENT NETWORK. WE ALSO FIXED YOUR FRONT DOOR. YOU’RE WELCOME.*

 

*I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING. WHY BOTHER WITH A BUNCH OF HIGH SCHOOL JOCKSACKS WHEN WE HAVE SICKER FUCKS TO DEAL WITH? WHY NOT GO AFTER KURT OR YOUR TWO MUSTACHIOED ADMIRERS? WELL, BUDDY, OUR OPERATION WORKS AS A SORT OF MERITOCRACY. PROVE YOUR WORTH—YOUR COMPETENCY, COMMITMENT AND ABILITY—TO THE SILENT, AND THE SILENT WILL RISE UP IN YOUR DEFENSE. TODAY, YOU EARN OUR LOYALTY. MAKE US PROUD, VICTOR.* 

 

*YOU MAY DISCONNECT YOUR HEADPHONES NOW.*

 

Vic complied, and the robot rolled to his seatmate. As she plugged into her own personalized presentation, Vic tried to do the honorable thing and keep his eyes to himself. He lasted maybe five minutes.       

 

On the screen, he saw his neighbor. Her pixelated doppelganger appeared younger—eighteen or nineteen, Vic guessed—lying prone across an elderly man’s lap, pants down, exposing her cream-white posterior. With a leather belt, the man began spanking her, savagely, over and over again. Crimson lines split the cream, crisscrossing into scars that she probably still bore in the present. 

 

*Who is that guy?* Vic wondered, scrutinizing the white-haired spanker. *Her dad? Grandpa? Teacher? Gardener? What’s his problem? Is this some kind of sex thing? Is she being raped? I mean, look how angry he is. Who peed in his Cheerios?* 

 

The camera panned into his neighbor’s young face. As she voiced screams that he couldn’t hear, Vic realized that she’d still had her tongue then. *Did this dude cut it out, or did she do it herself, for the Silent Minority?* 

 

Embarrassed, he turned away, to study his neighbor’s current face. Her eyes streamed tears. Behind the surgical mask, her mouth had undoubtedly contorted into something terrible. 

 

*How can the Silent Minority do this to her?* Vic wondered. *How did they even get that footage? Forcing her to relieve that abuse is monstrous. She should be in therapy or something, not watching this shit. I should smash that robot, force the bus driver to pull over, and bring this girl back to Turquoise Street, away from all these creepy bastards. No, that wouldn’t work. My neighbors make that guy look like Mister Rogers.*  

 

Eventually, Beth’s presentation ended, and the robot wheeled over to a bespectacled, morbidly obese spinster. Vic’s seatmate made a sound, a sort of liquid bark. Hearing it shriveled Vic’s soul. *Fuck it,* he thought, pulling his mask down to kiss the girl’s cheek. 

 

Gently squeezing her arm, he whispered, “You’re not alone.” 

 

This time, she gave no admonishment. Instead, the girl rested her head against his shoulder, allowing Vic to throw an arm around her. They remained like that, like a couple of middle schoolers on their third date, until the bus stopped.   

 

Vic had expected to see a high school exterior, but instead found himself appraising a piss-yellow, single-story stretch of connected rooms. The motel faced the parking lot, with closed doors and shuttered windows hiding all present guests.       

 

The robot rolled backward, positioning itself at the front of the bus. *“Comrades, we’ve arrived,”* it announced. *“Allow me to introduce some new friends: Candy, Hester and Kelly Z. Come on in, girls.”* 

 

The door whooshed open, allowing three night ladies to stumble into sight. They wore fishnets, shiny leather skirts, hoop earrings, and fringe crop tops. Their teeth were bad, their faces prematurely aged. Still, they sported large fake breasts and inner thighs that could crack walnuts.   

 

*“For those of you wondering,”* the robot continued, *“these women are in fact prostitutes. Yes, they’ve already been paid for their services. In fact, these three vixens are going to help land us some jocks. Still, for those of you who’ve never touched a live female, and always wanted to, feel free to come forward and get your grope on.”*

 

About half of the passengers did. Both males and females stumbled forward with their eyes downcast, to squeeze breasts and backsides before shuffling back, embarrassed. The prostitutes looked ready to laugh and jeer, but retained their composure for the moment. 

 

*Aw, what the hell?* Vic thought. *I wouldn’t mind a fondle.* He began to rise, but then caught the neighbor girl staring. Her eyes said: *Please don’t. Please tell me that there’s at least one man alive who isn’t a heartless pervert. I need to believe in someone.* 

 

Vic sat back down.        

 

The robot continued. *“Now that we’ve gotten that out of our systems, let’s get back to business. Basically, if everything goes as planned, a fourth prostitute will arrive momentarily, bringing the entire East Pacific High football team with her. She visited their practice earlier, possibly showed a bit of tit, and invited them to a little ‘party.’* 

 

*“I know what you’re thinking. Aren’t these paragons of muscled mediocrity already dating cheerleaders and the like? Why would they need hookers? Well, let me drop a little robot knowledge on y’all. In high school, one’s hormones are at an all-time high. Ergo, whatever sex these Neanderthals are getting, it’s far from enough. Most of their girlfriends put out sparingly, anyway, as that is the only way to keep these cavemen in line.* 

 

*“Our girl’s going to offer them free sex, enough to go around. Any guy with objections is going to ignore them—if they don’t want to get ostracized by their teammates, that is. Even the closeted gay players will be forced to join in. Trust your friendly robot friend. This isn’t my first rodeo.*

 

*“Anyway, our quartet of professionals are going to roofie every jock for us. That’s right: Rohypnol, baby, the rapist’s drug of choice. How will they accomplish this? ‘Hey, who wants to take a shot of tequila out of my vagina? Step up, studs!’ Herd mentality will take care of the rest. Once the roofies kick in, you guys will enter the equation. More details to follow.”* 

 

Stumbling from the bus, the hookers disappeared into a rented room. Vic wished that he could follow them. Some minutes later, a yellow school bus pulled up—windows down, belching weed smoke into the atmosphere—filled with rambunctious shouters. 

 

*“Duck down; don’t let them see you,”* the robot demanded, and the Silent complied. Still, Vic couldn’t resist peeking out the window, to scope the new arrivals. Dressed in their chill clothes, an entire football team spilled onto the blacktop, just as the robot had predicted. With them was a fourth prostitute: an Amazonian African-American, the sexiest of the bunch. Together, they joined the other three professionals, and the door closed behind them. 

 

*“Wait for the signal,”* the robot insisted. 

 

Time passed, slowly, with many Silent scrutinizing their own palms, as if unable to believe that they’d grasped living, breathing women, however briefly. One guy went so far as to smell his hand, and then give it a cursory lick. *Good God, we’re pathetic,* Vic thought ruefully. *I’m surprised that nobody’s pocket-jerking right now. Or are they?* 

 

Finally, the door reopened. Kelly Z peeked out, shooting them a thumbs-up.

 

*“The time has come,”* the robot said. *“Everybody, grab a Taser on the way out. Four amongst you—raise your hands for identification, please—have been appointed to lead. The rest shall follow their example.”*

 

Filing past the bus driver, the Silent collected Tasers from the open cardboard box that he gripped, and then followed the leaders into the motel room. One leader carried the robot along.  

 

The room reeked of sweat, liquor, vomit, and high-grade pot. It was so people-stuffed that there was scarcely room to stand. 

 

They found the football players sprawled and giggling, attempting to rise, but lacking the proper coordination and muscle control. Three of the four hookers were dressed, with the fourth too intent on fingering herself to realize that their job was finished. Her labia resembled cold cuts tenderized with a ball-peen hammer, then liberally sprinkled with genital warts. *Gross*, Vic thought. 

 

“Hey, who invited the freak show?” one jock shouted, eliciting laughter from his comrades. 

 

“Why’s it smell like virgin all of a sudden?” another asked. 

 

The robot’s speakers blared, replaying the roar of thousands of sports spectators, undoubtedly recorded at one bowl game or another. A referee’s whistle sounded, shrill and monstrous. 

 

“The fuck?” one jock asked. “Wha’ you faggots doin’?” Three players had already nodded off, so the leaders blasted them with electrodes, Taser-shocking them back into semi-consciousness.

 

*“Greetings, Squids,”* the robot enthused. *“You were not aware of it, but today is the Day of the Introvert. To begin with, we ask that you remove your clothing.”* 

 

“Fuck you!” the players shouted, along with much slurred speculation concerning the Silent Minority’s sexuality.

 

*We’re making them get naked?* Vic wondered. *That seems so…gay. Can’t we just beat the shit out of them, and leave it at that? This isn’t gonna turn into some kind of dropped soap opera, is it?* 

 

“It’s like…shit…uh…” a linebacker slurred. 

 

*“Take your clothes off,”* the robot ordered. 

 

The fourth hooker had finally gotten the hint. Now dressed, she touched the bus driver’s shoulder and said, “Hey, we’re takin’ off. I mean…this is pretty fucked up, guy. We did what you wanted, didn’t we?”

 

The bus driver nodded. Watching the women file out of the room, Vic felt his stomach lurch. *I shouldn’t be here. This is…wrong.* 

 

Though confused and dizzy, struggling with simple motor skills, the football team remained defiant. “I’ll fuck you up,” one promised. Noticing a shapely Silent Minority female, he said, “Hey, dis one’s a bitch. Come here, baby. I gotta present for ya.” He pointed at his genitals. 

 

The girl walked over, leaned down, and shocked the proffered package. The jock screamed, thick and clotted. His torment was like blood in the water, and soon introverts were Taser-blasting every jock present. Some went so far as to throw punches and kicks, most being feebly delivered. 

 

The players flopped and convulsed, swore and mumbled. Vic just watched, feeling as if he should care about somebody, anybody. He didn’t want to hurt the jocks or assist them. He only wanted to leave. *Was there ever such a thing as morality?* he wondered. *Or did some starry-eyed writer just imagine it?*    

 

*“Take off their clothes,”* the robot ordered. *“Take off their clothes, and prop them so they’re standing. We can’t stay here forever.”*

 

The Silent complied. Soon, nearly fifty players—first, second, and third-string—were pushed against the far wall, unsteady on their feet, waving and swaying to inebriated inner rhythms. All were nude. Blinking furiously, they gaped and gasped, attempting to focus their thoughts. 

 

On the robot’s display screen, the face shifted from grey to a furious red. Growing thick ebon horns, it became a cartoonish Beelzebub countenance. Its voice changed as well, becoming demonic: dozens of agonized utterances intermingled.  

 

*“HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?”* it asked the inebriated. *“NAKED, HUMILIATED, BRUISED AND BLEARY. WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH YOU? PERHAPS YOU’D LIKE TO DANGLE FOR A WHILE, JUST LIKE YOUR BUDDY MARTY. NO, THAT WOULDN’T MAKE OUR POINT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THERE’S ONE THING THAT WE AT THE SILENT MINORITY BELIEVE IN, IT’S SCHOOL SPIRIT. ISN’T THAT RIGHT, COMRADES?”*

 

As one, the Silent nodded—even Vic. Not that he’d ever cared about any school, but he was becoming hip to the robot’s showmanship. He knew that the little contraption was building up to something. 

 

*“I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU SO-CALLED ATHLETES. GIVE US ONE GOOD ROUND OF YOUR EAST PACIFIC FIGHT SONG AND WE’LL LET YOU GO. YOU MORONS MUST’VE BELCHED IT A THOUSAND TIMES BY NOW, SO WE EXPECT YOU TO ARTICULATE.”*

 

The Squids laughed and grumbled. Some shouted slurred threats. “Eat my dick, robo-faggot!” one yelled. 

 

*“SUCH HOMOPHOBIA. BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOU’RE THE ONE STANDING NAKED IN A CLUSTER OF DUDES. OBVIOUSLY, YOU’RE INTO IT, OR ELSE YOU FUCKERS WOULD HAVE MADE WITH THE LYRICS ALREADY, SO THAT WE CAN ALL GO HOME.”*

 

But the players weren’t having it. And so the four Silent leaders momentarily disappeared. Returning, each clutched a shotgun, pointed authoritatively forward. 

 

*Oh, shit,* Vic thought. *Am I about to view some burst craniums? Should I just start running—somewhere, anywhere—before I become complicit in this bizarre torture scenario? Ah, whatever.* 

 

*“LAST CHANCE,”* the robot bellowed. *“SING YOUR FIGHT SONG NOW!”* 

 

No dice. And so the four leaders fired, deafening in the room’s close quarters. Four jocks flew backward, toppling the rest over like dominoes. But there was no blood, just angry thoracic blotches, which would soon shift to purple, signifying broken ribs. The players screamed and bellowed, and had to be helped back to their feet. 

 

*“THAT’S RIGHT, FUCKERS. THESE HERE SHOTGUNS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO FIRE BEANBAG ROUNDS: TINY PILLOWS FILLED WITH BIRDSHOT. THEY MIGHT NOT KILL YOU, BUT THEY SURE HURT LIKE THE DEVIL. THAT OL’ SING-ALONG DOESN’T SEEM SO BAD NOW, DOES IT? AND A ONE, AND A TWO…”*

 

There came a bit of mumbling and humming, some slurred something or other. 

 

*“C’MON, SQUIDS! Y’ALL CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT! HERE, WHY DON’T I GET YOU STARTED? PURPLE-GREY, OBLITERATE. PURPLE-GREY, THE BEST IN STATE…YOU KNOW THE REST.”*

 

Finally, they performed the fight song. The lyrics, as Vic understood them, went as follows:

 

*Purple-grey, obliterate*

*Purple-grey, the best in state*

*With pride we fight for glory true*

*In sunny skies, in oceans blue*

*Rah, rah, rah, we take the field*

*Go, team, go, with sword and shield*

*EPHS charge!*

 

They looked so stupid there, swaying with their chill-shriveled dongs out, chanting those asinine lyrics. When Vic noticed the four Silent leaders recording the performance with their cellphones, understanding finally dawned. The footage would leak out, and the group would be slandered mercilessly, to the point where they’d think twice before bashing any more human piñatas. 

 

*Well, that’s not so bad, all things considered,* Vic thought. *Man, I thought we’d spend the evening dissolving bodies, or maybe digging out desert graves.* He began to laugh, his mirth quickly terminated by the glares of the Silent. *Man, these dudes really can’t stand human articulations. Maybe I should learn how to talk like that kooky multiple personality robot. Yeah, maybe.* 

 

Having finished their chant, the Squids stood staring slackly. The robot’s countenance receded from the devilish, back into the genderless grey it had started out as. Its speaker-projected voice returned to normal, speaking conciliatorily now: *“Gee, that wasn’t so bad, was it? Had you fellas been so accommodating to begin with, we might have spared ourselves some unpleasantness. Go ahead, get dressed.”*

 

With assistance from the Silent Minority, the jocks concealed their shame. Some of them had the wrong clothes on—too baggy, or slut-tight—but at least their horrible tan lines were gone. 

 

*“We hope that you learned something today,”* the robot said. *“No longer shall the Silent suffer meekly. Remember that factoid in the days to come. Your hateful bullying brought you here, nothing else. Thuggish savagery demands retribution, now and forevermore. The Day of the Introvert shall sprout into an era.*

 

*“Hang around for a while, until one of you has sobered up enough to drive. We wouldn’t want your team to die in a fiery bus crash, ha-ha. Goodbye, friends. Don’t make us pay you another visit.”*

 

As the Silent began exiting, one of them darted forward, shedding his “speak no evil” mask. *Oh, I knew it,* Vic thought. *That’s totally Marty MacNamara.* 

 

“Remember me?” Marty inquired with a cracking shout. His face appeared to thin and stretch, until it seemed to Vic that something demonic peered out of those tormented eye sockets. From his pocket, Marty pulled a butterfly knife, fanning it open single-handedly. Before anybody could think to react, he rushed the nearest player. 

 

*Jab* the knife went, into a Samoan’s carotid. Hand to his neck, the jock face-slapped the floor. Marty screamed triumphantly, and actually licked the blood from his blade before rushing a mulleted ginger, who must have weighted a quarter ton. *Jab, jab, jab,* and a fleshy abdomen became confetti. The ginger screamed, his screeches echoed by his teammates as the Silent fell upon Marty, and wrestled him out of the room. 

 

*Should I call an ambulance?* Vic wondered. In his mind, two Vic-selves argued—the guy he’d been and whatever Vic was becoming. *Nah, fuck ’em. Let those malevolent jerks bleed out.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

During the return drive, the robot paid each Silent Minority member a second visit. It seemed like overkill, but what could Vic do?

 

At any rate, he was presented with more footage shot within his erstwhile residence. Two men, vaguely familiar, ransacked cupboards and closets, floor-strewing their contents. 

 

“We’ll search for twenty minutes,” a balding man with an overbite declared. His voice identified him as Bill, already twice recorded plotting against Vic. *Three strikes, you’re out, Bill.*  

 

“Yeah, what if we find something?” his beanie-wearing accomplice asked. 

 

“That faggot will get a fair trial. Fair, as long as it ends with him in prison or a fuckin’ madhouse.”

 

Mercifully, that short bit seemed to be all that the robot had left. *I wonder what those douchebags were looking for*, Vic thought. *Proof of Knut’s murder? Or have they convinced themselves that I’m guilty of some other crime? That neighborhood’s obsession with me is all kinds of pathetic. Seriously, we need to swerve this bus toward Turquoise Street. Skin those fucks alive.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Though somewhat disappointed, Vic wasn’t surprised to glance down the next morning and discover his doorstep vacant. *That across-the-hall girl is probably too traumatized to cook*, he realized. *I mean, shit, between the horrible footage that robot made her watch and the violence of the jock takedown, she’s probably curled up in the fetal position right now, sobbing like a side-speared sea lion. Luckily, I’m made of sterner stuff.* 

 

He spent the day channel surfing, flipping through newscast after newscast, wondering how their assault would be reported. Hours later, he struck gold. 

 

There was Erin Rodriguez, XBC News, she of the power suit and bob cut. The reporter was somewhat of a celebrity, having broken the story of the Minnesota Corpse Shack a year prior. Now she stood before an institution, whose painted exterior bore the words *EAST PACIFIC HIGH SCHOOL*, beneath which an anthropomorphized purple squid smiled sinisterly. Battling her own burgeoning smirk, the woman attempted a serious demeanor. 

 

“I’m reporting live from East Pacific High School,” she announced, “home to the Squids, football players struggling to live up to their five-times National Championship winning predecessors. 

 

“Last night, this talented group of young athletes faced its greatest challenge yet, far from the gridiron. That’s right, in a tragic turn of events that has left this SoCal community reeling, the entire team was abducted and brutalized by the terrorist group, al-Qaeda.”

 

Had Vic been drinking anything at that moment, it would have gone spraying from his face, replicating insipid sitcom slapstick. *Al-Qaeda?* he thought. *How the hell did they get the credit?*     

 

“The assault resulted in two deaths: Aiono Palamo and Buford ‘Pellet’ Littleton, both of whom succumbed to violent stabbings. Our hearts go out to their families and friends, as their shock segues to mourning. 

 

“Worse, a video hit the Internet, hours ago, featuring the entire team naked and terrified, forced to sing their school fight song.” XBC then aired a brief clip of a performance Vic had caught live—with the genitals fortunately blurred, unlike the video that the Silent had leaked on Skewlclips. “I’m here with star cornerback, Javon Johns. Javon, what can you tell us about your experience?”

 

Javon stumbled forward, his eyes red and lidded between a Kangol and a turtleneck. Whether his blurred oculi stemmed from roofie remnants or fresh blunt sucking, Vic didn’t care to speculate.

 

“Aw, it was crazy,” Javon mumbled. “Niggas run up on us, be like sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, nahm saying? Dudes rocking turbans, waving them AKs, straight thuggin’. Before I knew it, they had us all staggered, like trippin’ over our shoes and shit.”

 

“And what of your slain teammates, Aiono Palamo and Buford Littleton?”

 

“Man, on the real, shit was tragic. I mean…I seen them sliced, man, crazy style. Them’s my peoples, nahm sayin’? Like, I’d have jumped into the mix, fucked them towelheads up, but my mind…it wasn’t workin’ right.”

 

“Yes, apparently the toxicologist found Rohypnol in your urine samples. Tell me, Javon, how did al-Qaeda manage to get an entire football team roofied?”

 

“I can’t remember, yo. I remember football practice, and then…it’s like…nothin’, nah mean? Next thing I know, shit’s straight up bin Laden.”    

 

“Thank you, Javon.” 

 

Vic switched off the TV. 

 

*Seriously?* he thought. *How the hell do you mistake a bunch of geeks in surgical masks for al-Qaeda? Were the roofies that strong? Or is this some kind of face saving dealie? Did the team decide that blaming it on Middle Easterners made them look less pussified? I mean, the whole world’s seen ’em singing with their dicks out. It’s not like they’ll ever live that down, no matter how they try to spin it. Or did XBC News make up the story, desperate for ratings? It doesn’t make sense.* 

 

*Seriously, I thought we were supposed to be sending a message: introverts have united, and will no longer stand for victimization against our kind. Now what? What was the point of it all? If anything, our actions will now lead to some poor immigrants getting jumped. Who’s running this show, anyway?*",1,1770912831.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

And weird they got. Vic returned to find his Silent doorstep drowning in flower petals—rose, tulip and hydrangea. *Please, please, please let these be from that girl across the hall. Don’t let those mustache dudes know about this place.* 

 

He went online. There was no Internet jack in his apartment, but a wireless router broadcasted from somewhere within the building. Scrolling through his favorite websites—Ain’t It Cool News, Newsarama and *The Onion*—he comprehended none of what he read. His thoughts kept circling around to his real home, pondering what his neighbors would come up with next. 

 

*I know that the Silent Minority has hidden cameras monitoring my house. I wonder if they’d let me tap into their feed. But how do I ask them? They gave me no email address, no phone number to call. I’m supposed to wait for contact, but when the hell will that be?*   

 

For a moment, his mind flashed upon a classic *Twilight Zone* episode, “People Are Alike All Over.” *Is that what’s happening? Am I an exhibit in a human zoo? Is this wall gonna slide sideways, revealing a crowd of cackling gawkers?* 

 

*Tomorrow*, he promised himself. *I’ll solve this mystery tomorrow.*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

The next morning, he found the doorstep flower petals dead. Upon them, a serving tray rested, populated with three domed dishes, which turned out to be Korean barbecue short ribs, corn on the cob, and grits. 

 

*Kind of a strange breakfast combination,* Vic thought. But when he began eating, everything made sense. *Holy shit, that’s good. Like…crazy good. Who is this chick anyway, some traumatized master chef? Is it too early to propose marriage?* 

 

He ate and ate, moaning contentedly, his shirt catching errant splatter. An entire family-sized meal went down his gullet, leaving Vic barely able to waddle to the couch. 

 

Too stuffed to investigate, he decided to give the mystery another day. Or two.  

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Stealthy footsteps, a door opening and closing—sounds which drew Vic from bed just past two A.M. Bypassing a cardboard envelope left on the entryway floor, he raced into the hallway. Its single bulb was out; all was dark. He saw a shadow sliding on shadows, and heard the stairwell door being hurled open. 

 

“Wait a minute!” he hollered, pursuing the intruder halfway down the stairs. Realizing that he was wearing only boxers, fearful of looking like a sex maniac, he aborted the chase.

 

Instead, he went back inside to give the envelope the ol’ pick-and-rip. It contained a recordable DVD with the words *WATCH ME* scribbled on it. *Thanks for the suggestion,* Vic thought sarcastically. *Otherwise, I might have tried flossing my teeth with it.* 

 

Reclining on the couch, his eyes crusted and sleep-swollen, he watched the video. It began with a text scroll, just like the *Star Wars* films. 

 

*HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF SKEWLCLIPS?* it asked. *IT’S A CROSS BETWEEN YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK, A SITE WHEREIN FRIEND GROUPS SHARE VIDEO CLIPS FEATURING THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS. SINCE THE SITE IS UNMONITORED, AND ONLY PREAPPROVED FRIENDS CAN WATCH THE VIDEOS, AN ANYTHING GOES MENTALITY HAS INFECTED IT. NOW, THE MOST POPULAR CLIPS INVOLVE BULLYING.*

 

*HOW DO WE KNOW THIS? WE CRACKED THE CODE WIDE OPEN. GHOSTLIKE, WE NOW DRIFT FROM ONE PEER GROUP TO THE NEXT, IDENTIFYING THE BIGGEST BULLIES, REPLAYING THEIR CRIMES AGAINST OUR KIND IN PIXEL PANORAMAS. HERE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS:*

 

The video featured a group of football players entering a locker room. Their purple and grey uniforms were grass-stained and sweat-soaked. Presumably, they’d just left the field.  

 

*MEET EAST PACIFIC HIGH SCHOOL’S FAMOUS FOOTBALL TEAM, THE SQUIDS*, the text read. *AS THE LATEST ITERATION OF THE INSTITUTION’S FIVE-TIMES NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP WINNING FOOTBALL PROGRAM, THESE HAPPENIN’ JOCKS HAVE A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.* 

 

The players began undressing, shedding their helmets and jerseys, starting in on their pads. *Uh-oh*, Vic thought. *I don’t think I like where this is going.* 

 

Mercifully, the picture jumped forward, to present the players in their street clothes: hoodies, slacks and sneakers, plus a few gaudy chains. The camera zoomed between them, spotlighting what appeared to be their every used jockstrap, still wet with perspiration, piled atop a bench. 

 

The picture zoomed out, revealing three of the players dragging a skinny struggler to the loaded bench. His hands were tied behind his back. Ropes encircled his legs, so that he couldn’t properly walk, only shuffle. 

 

The text returned: *MEET MARTY* *MACNAMARA, AKA SOLOMON THE SQUID. THIS POOR LITTLE FELLOW THOUGHT THAT BY BECOMING EAST PACIFIC’S MASCOT, HE WOULD FINALLY LAND SOME FRIENDS. LOOK WHAT HE GOT FOR HIS EFFORTS.*

 

Out came a flying harness, presumably stolen from the school’s theatre department. Struggling, Marty was strapped into it. Soon, he was dangling from the ceiling, a living piñata. As he thrashed, his laughing tormentors looped their jockstraps over his arms and legs, until every undergarment adorned him. 

 

“Piñata, bitch!” one player shouted. “Whoever knocks the most straps off wins!” 

 

“Wins what?” another demanded. “Let’s make this shit interesting!”

 

“You’re right, muthafucka! Five bucks each, winner takes all! Ante up, homies!”

 

A pile of Lincolns grew upon a bench. After everybody contributed, a yardstick materialized. One by one, the players swung at the screaming Marty, collecting whatever jockstraps fell, as agony made their victim’s limbs spasm. Some seemed disinterested in the money, directing their swings against poor Marty’s face. 

 

Soon, every strap had fallen. The winner was a large Caucasian, who looked a decade older than any high schooler Vic had ever seen. As he collected his money, the camera panned back to the dangling Marty—his eyes swollen shut, blood dripping from his nose and lips. The pudgy filmer turned the camera around, mugging for his viewers. “East Pacific, bitch!” he barked. “Squids for life!”     

 

The screen went black; the text returned: *THAT POOR LITTLE DANGLER. REALIZE THIS: MARTY COULD BE ANY OF US, AND THUS WE MUST AVENGE HIM. BE ON THE BUS AT SIX A.M. TOMORROW. YOU’LL FIND IT PARKED JUST OUTSIDE OF THIS COMPLEX. MORE DETAILS TO FOLLOW.*

 

 Vic took the DVD out, and glared at it like it was a rabid animal. *Goddamn,* he thought. *I knew that something like this was coming. Time to take a ride, I guess.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Then came the alarm clock, the bleary-eyed coffee slurps. Somebody had vacuumed up the dead flower petals, leaving behind one of those “speak no evil” surgical masks and a note: *PUT THIS ON AND COME ON DOWN. REMEMBER, VICTOR, SILENCE IS GOLDEN.*

 

As an afterthought, he grabbed a hoodie. *Should I bring the gun?* he wondered. *Nah, the note didn’t mention it.* 

 

Straddling the sidewalk was a vehicle that resembled a party bus, one repainted in drab, depressing hues. Vic climbed the steps. 

 

*Holy shit, it is a party bus—strobe lights, leather seats, and everything. Is that a stripper pole? Yeah, good luck getting this crowd to use it.* 

 

There were sixty-eight seats—sixty-nine, if one included the driver—and nearly all of them were taken. Beholding his supposed compatriots in their monkey-fingered masks, Vic shuddered. Here were the sad ones, the psychopaths, and the social rejects. Some had the wide, flagrant eyes of spree killers; others stared into their laps. Most dwelt outside society’s definition of beautiful, although a couple could have passed for models. Some were scarred; others were missing ears or fingers. Nobody spoke a word.     

 

Vic couldn’t be sure with the mask, but one of the passengers looked suspiciously like Marty MacNamara from the video. *Hey, wait a minute,* Vic thought. *How come we’re going after this guy’s bullies? What about my creepy-ass neighbors? I mean, what those two dudes had planned for me was way worse than some airborne beat down. I need to figure out who runs this thing, and put my name in the queue.*

 

He caught two eyes studying him—the girl from across the hall, with an empty seat beside her. Claiming it, Vic shot the girl a smile she couldn’t see. *Aw, what the hell?* he thought, grabbing her hand, giving it an affectionate squeeze. Her eyes went wide, but she didn’t pull her hand away. 

 

Vic wondered what making out with a tongueless chick would be like. His palm grew sweaty. *Man, I really need to learn her name.* 

 

At the sound of a buzzing motor, the girl jerked her hand away. Vic glanced up to see a robot rolling down the aisle, what looked like a Roomba fortified for frontline combat. Mounted atop it was a display screen, occupied by a grey, computer-generated face, devoid of race or gender.      

 

The pixelated countenance spoke, in a strange tone neither masculine nor effeminate. “*Welcome*,” it said. “*Today, we stand together, the Silent Minority. We are better than pointless killing sprees, better than the monsters that they pretend we are. It’s time for average citizens to learn the power of introverts united. It’s time to overthrow some jocks.”*

 

The robot voice paused. With any other audience, a cheer would have erupted. Instead, Vic heard a sneeze, a low cough, and the awkward sound of posteriors shifting on leather seats.

 

*“Now let’s keep this a surprise, shall we? You’ll learn your destination when we reach it, along with the mission objectives. For now, enjoy the ride. I’ll be visiting with each of you individually as we drive.”*

 

Compartments opened in the ceiling. Like airplane oxygen masks, a pair of headphones fell for each passenger. As the bus lurched into life, the robot wheeled over to a scrawny, scarecrow-resembling twitcher. Inserting his jack into the robot’s headphone port, the twitcher listened quietly. Still, nobody spoke.

 

Vic fought the urge to scream, to jump from seat to seat like a gorilla unbound. The mystery was getting to him. *Are we going for a prank or hospitalizations?* he wondered. *Is somebody going to die today?* It felt as if he’d binged on Starbucks. His heart beat like a string of firecrackers: pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

 

He knew that he wasn’t supposed to talk, but couldn’t resist whispering “hello” to his seatmate.

 

Glaring, she put a forefinger to her mask-concealed lips. So instead he pantomimed eating, shoveling his hands toward his mouth and patting his stomach. He gave her a thumbs-up. *Does she get that I’m thanking her for the food?* he wondered. 

 

The drive lasted ages. Vic wished that he had the window seat, to give him some idea of their destination. *Are we going to East Pacific High School, or somewhere else?* he wondered. *Where the fuck is East Pacific High School, anyway?* 

 

Eventually, the robot rolled over to Vic. When he plugged his headphones in, the grey face winked. *“Hello, Victor,”* it said. *“We are so glad that you decided to join us. Are you enjoying your apartment? Your old neighbors have stayed busy in your absence.”*

 

The face disappeared, replaced by words and footage. *REMEMBER KURT JANSSON, BROTHER OF THE RECENTLY DEPARTED KNUT? OF COURSE YOU DO. WELL, THE MAN SEEMS SOMEWHAT FIXATED ON YOU, VICTOR. LET’S CHECK IN WITH HIM, SHALL WE?*

 

The footage revealed a night-swallowed cemetery: teethlike headstones gleaming, protruding from ebon ocean. Amidst them, illuminated by three portable spotlights, a man dug up a fresh grave. The camera zoomed in, revealing Kurt’s familiar features. 

 

*Damn, they’re stalking this guy for me,* Vic realized. *That’s kind of…flattering.*

 

The hole grew large enough for Kurt to disappear down. The blade of his swinging shovel plunged down again and again, presumably battering a coffin. *Wait a minute, is that Knut’s grave? Is this weirdo looking for a family reunion? Holy mackerel.* 

 

But when Kurt emerged minutes later, the severed cranium that he clutched belonged to no man, but a young blonde woman, recently deceased. Her eyes were open, her lips pursed as if to kiss.  

 

*No fucking way. What the hell is going on with this dude? Is it a sex thing? Why is the Silent Minority even showing me this?*

 

The video cut to a filthy hotel room interior—dark-stained walls and carpet, vomit splattered across the bedspread and curtains. And there was Kurt, working with immaculate concentration. Utilizing a buck knife, he gently peeled the woman’s face from her skull, and then held it up for inspection. 

 

Vic had seen enough. He pulled out his headphones and shuttered his eyes. He didn’t know how the Silent Minority had gotten their camera into the hotel room, but it was obvious what they were up to. They wanted him overwhelmingly enraged, so that he’d go along with their little jockpocalypse without forethought. *Sometimes it’s better not to know,* he realized. *These people want me so focused on my sicko neighbors that I think of nothing else. They want me to see Kurt’s face on every jock we encounter, to make me all the more merciless. I’m hip to their bullshit, though. I’m not cutting off my tongue.*   

 

*“Victor Dickens, please reconnect your headphones!”* the robot blared. *“You’ve ignominies yet to witness.”*

 

Now the Silent were staring, wide-eyed, over their seats. Meekly, Vic plugged his headphones back in, and forced himself to watch the footage. It got worse. 

 

Kurt laughed and cried, ballroom dancing with an empty face. *Holy Buffalo Bill, this dude’s a weirdo,* Vic marveled. *What does he do on Christmas, build a tree of severed arms, with each hand clutching a blown glass ornament? He’s gonna wear the face, isn’t he? Just slip the thing on like a hockey mask. And what the hell happened to his wife and kid? Did they leave him? Did he kill them? Seriously, what the fuck?*

 

But the face wasn’t Kurt’s to wear. From the bathroom, the man retrieved a black-bristled, snouted struggler: a potbellied pig, grotesquely obese. From his suitcase, Kurt withdrew a needle and some suture thread. 

 

*Don’t do it, dude!* Vic wanted to scream. But it wouldn’t have mattered. Kurt stitched the corpse face over the pig’s face, leaving upright ears poking over a nightmare countenance. *At least there’s no sound. That pig’s gotta be screaming something terrible.* 

 

The scene cut to the interior of Vic’s abandoned residence. There was Kurt, setting his corpse-masked swine loose, to thump and bump its way across the living room. Exiting through a broken front door, Kurt left the terror-spurred animal to its ponderous rampage. The screen cut to black. The words returned:

 

*DON’T WORRY, VICTOR. WE RESCUED MISTER OINKS-A-LOT. IT WOULDN’T DO TO HAVE THE AUTHORITIES LOOKING INTO YOU, TO HAVE YOUR NAME HOLLERED ACROSS THE MEDIA BY AWFUL GHOULS LIKE NANNY GAINES. WE EVEN GOT THE FACE OFF, AND DONATED THAT POOR FELLER TO THE PIG PLACEMENT NETWORK. WE ALSO FIXED YOUR FRONT DOOR. YOU’RE WELCOME.*

 

*I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING. WHY BOTHER WITH A BUNCH OF HIGH SCHOOL JOCKSACKS WHEN WE HAVE SICKER FUCKS TO DEAL WITH? WHY NOT GO AFTER KURT OR YOUR TWO MUSTACHIOED ADMIRERS? WELL, BUDDY, OUR OPERATION WORKS AS A SORT OF MERITOCRACY. PROVE YOUR WORTH—YOUR COMPETENCY, COMMITMENT AND ABILITY—TO THE SILENT, AND THE SILENT WILL RISE UP IN YOUR DEFENSE. TODAY, YOU EARN OUR LOYALTY. MAKE US PROUD, VICTOR.* 

 

*YOU MAY DISCONNECT YOUR HEADPHONES NOW.*

 

Vic complied, and the robot rolled to his seatmate. As she plugged into her own personalized presentation, Vic tried to do the honorable thing and keep his eyes to himself. He lasted maybe five minutes.       

 

On the screen, he saw his neighbor. Her pixelated doppelganger appeared younger—eighteen or nineteen, Vic guessed—lying prone across an elderly man’s lap, pants down, exposing her cream-white posterior. With a leather belt, the man began spanking her, savagely, over and over again. Crimson lines split the cream, crisscrossing into scars that she probably still bore in the present. 

 

*Who is that guy?* Vic wondered, scrutinizing the white-haired spanker. *Her dad? Grandpa? Teacher? Gardener? What’s his problem? Is this some kind of sex thing? Is she being raped? I mean, look how angry he is. Who peed in his Cheerios?* 

 

The camera panned into his neighbor’s young face. As she voiced screams that he couldn’t hear, Vic realized that she’d still had her tongue then. *Did this dude cut it out, or did she do it herself, for the Silent Minority?* 

 

Embarrassed, he turned away, to study his neighbor’s current face. Her eyes streamed tears. Behind the surgical mask, her mouth had undoubtedly contorted into something terrible. 

 

*How can the Silent Minority do this to her?* Vic wondered. *How did they even get that footage? Forcing her to relieve that abuse is monstrous. She should be in therapy or something, not watching this shit. I should smash that robot, force the bus driver to pull over, and bring this girl back to Turquoise Street, away from all these creepy bastards. No, that wouldn’t work. My neighbors make that guy look like Mister Rogers.*  

 

Eventually, Beth’s presentation ended, and the robot wheeled over to a bespectacled, morbidly obese spinster. Vic’s seatmate made a sound, a sort of liquid bark. Hearing it shriveled Vic’s soul. *Fuck it,* he thought, pulling his mask down to kiss the girl’s cheek. 

 

Gently squeezing her arm, he whispered, “You’re not alone.” 

 

This time, she gave no admonishment. Instead, the girl rested her head against his shoulder, allowing Vic to throw an arm around her. They remained like that, like a couple of middle schoolers on their third date, until the bus stopped.   

 

Vic had expected to see a high school exterior, but instead found himself appraising a piss-yellow, single-story stretch of connected rooms. The motel faced the parking lot, with closed doors and shuttered windows hiding all present guests.       

 

The robot rolled backward, positioning itself at the front of the bus. *“Comrades, we’ve arrived,”* it announced. *“Allow me to introduce some new friends: Candy, Hester and Kelly Z. Come on in, girls.”* 

 

The door whooshed open, allowing three night ladies to stumble into sight. They wore fishnets, shiny leather skirts, hoop earrings, and fringe crop tops. Their teeth were bad, their faces prematurely aged. Still, they sported large fake breasts and inner thighs that could crack walnuts.   

 

*“For those of you wondering,”* the robot continued, *“these women are in fact prostitutes. Yes, they’ve already been paid for their services. In fact, these three vixens are going to help land us some jocks. Still, for those of you who’ve never touched a live female, and always wanted to, feel free to come forward and get your grope on.”*

 

About half of the passengers did. Both males and females stumbled forward with their eyes downcast, to squeeze breasts and backsides before shuffling back, embarrassed. The prostitutes looked ready to laugh and jeer, but retained their composure for the moment. 

 

*Aw, what the hell?* Vic thought. *I wouldn’t mind a fondle.* He began to rise, but then caught the neighbor girl staring. Her eyes said: *Please don’t. Please tell me that there’s at least one man alive who isn’t a heartless pervert. I need to believe in someone.* 

 

Vic sat back down.        

 

The robot continued. *“Now that we’ve gotten that out of our systems, let’s get back to business. Basically, if everything goes as planned, a fourth prostitute will arrive momentarily, bringing the entire East Pacific High football team with her. She visited their practice earlier, possibly showed a bit of tit, and invited them to a little ‘party.’* 

 

*“I know what you’re thinking. Aren’t these paragons of muscled mediocrity already dating cheerleaders and the like? Why would they need hookers? Well, let me drop a little robot knowledge on y’all. In high school, one’s hormones are at an all-time high. Ergo, whatever sex these Neanderthals are getting, it’s far from enough. Most of their girlfriends put out sparingly, anyway, as that is the only way to keep these cavemen in line.* 

 

*“Our girl’s going to offer them free sex, enough to go around. Any guy with objections is going to ignore them—if they don’t want to get ostracized by their teammates, that is. Even the closeted gay players will be forced to join in. Trust your friendly robot friend. This isn’t my first rodeo.*

 

*“Anyway, our quartet of professionals are going to roofie every jock for us. That’s right: Rohypnol, baby, the rapist’s drug of choice. How will they accomplish this? ‘Hey, who wants to take a shot of tequila out of my vagina? Step up, studs!’ Herd mentality will take care of the rest. Once the roofies kick in, you guys will enter the equation. More details to follow.”* 

 

Stumbling from the bus, the hookers disappeared into a rented room. Vic wished that he could follow them. Some minutes later, a yellow school bus pulled up—windows down, belching weed smoke into the atmosphere—filled with rambunctious shouters. 

 

*“Duck down; don’t let them see you,”* the robot demanded, and the Silent complied. Still, Vic couldn’t resist peeking out the window, to scope the new arrivals. Dressed in their chill clothes, an entire football team spilled onto the blacktop, just as the robot had predicted. With them was a fourth prostitute: an Amazonian African-American, the sexiest of the bunch. Together, they joined the other three professionals, and the door closed behind them. 

 

*“Wait for the signal,”* the robot insisted. 

 

Time passed, slowly, with many Silent scrutinizing their own palms, as if unable to believe that they’d grasped living, breathing women, however briefly. One guy went so far as to smell his hand, and then give it a cursory lick. *Good God, we’re pathetic,* Vic thought ruefully. *I’m surprised that nobody’s pocket-jerking right now. Or are they?* 

 

Finally, the door reopened. Kelly Z peeked out, shooting them a thumbs-up.

 

*“The time has come,”* the robot said. *“Everybody, grab a Taser on the way out. Four amongst you—raise your hands for identification, please—have been appointed to lead. The rest shall follow their example.”*

 

Filing past the bus driver, the Silent collected Tasers from the open cardboard box that he gripped, and then followed the leaders into the motel room. One leader carried the robot along.  

 

The room reeked of sweat, liquor, vomit, and high-grade pot. It was so people-stuffed that there was scarcely room to stand. 

 

They found the football players sprawled and giggling, attempting to rise, but lacking the proper coordination and muscle control. Three of the four hookers were dressed, with the fourth too intent on fingering herself to realize that their job was finished. Her labia resembled cold cuts tenderized with a ball-peen hammer, then liberally sprinkled with genital warts. *Gross*, Vic thought. 

 

“Hey, who invited the freak show?” one jock shouted, eliciting laughter from his comrades. 

 

“Why’s it smell like virgin all of a sudden?” another asked. 

 

The robot’s speakers blared, replaying the roar of thousands of sports spectators, undoubtedly recorded at one bowl game or another. A referee’s whistle sounded, shrill and monstrous. 

 

“The fuck?” one jock asked. “Wha’ you faggots doin’?” Three players had already nodded off, so the leaders blasted them with electrodes, Taser-shocking them back into semi-consciousness.

 

*“Greetings, Squids,”* the robot enthused. *“You were not aware of it, but today is the Day of the Introvert. To begin with, we ask that you remove your clothing.”* 

 

“Fuck you!” the players shouted, along with much slurred speculation concerning the Silent Minority’s sexuality.

 

*We’re making them get naked?* Vic wondered. *That seems so…gay. Can’t we just beat the shit out of them, and leave it at that? This isn’t gonna turn into some kind of dropped soap opera, is it?* 

 

“It’s like…shit…uh…” a linebacker slurred. 

 

*“Take your clothes off,”* the robot ordered. 

 

The fourth hooker had finally gotten the hint. Now dressed, she touched the bus driver’s shoulder and said, “Hey, we’re takin’ off. I mean…this is pretty fucked up, guy. We did what you wanted, didn’t we?”

 

The bus driver nodded. Watching the women file out of the room, Vic felt his stomach lurch. *I shouldn’t be here. This is…wrong.* 

 

Though confused and dizzy, struggling with simple motor skills, the football team remained defiant. “I’ll fuck you up,” one promised. Noticing a shapely Silent Minority female, he said, “Hey, dis one’s a bitch. Come here, baby. I gotta present for ya.” He pointed at his genitals. 

 

The girl walked over, leaned down, and shocked the proffered package. The jock screamed, thick and clotted. His torment was like blood in the water, and soon introverts were Taser-blasting every jock present. Some went so far as to throw punches and kicks, most being feebly delivered. 

 

The players flopped and convulsed, swore and mumbled. Vic just watched, feeling as if he should care about somebody, anybody. He didn’t want to hurt the jocks or assist them. He only wanted to leave. *Was there ever such a thing as morality?* he wondered. *Or did some starry-eyed writer just imagine it?*    

 

*“Take off their clothes,”* the robot ordered. *“Take off their clothes, and prop them so they’re standing. We can’t stay here forever.”*

 

The Silent complied. Soon, nearly fifty players—first, second, and third-string—were pushed against the far wall, unsteady on their feet, waving and swaying to inebriated inner rhythms. All were nude. Blinking furiously, they gaped and gasped, attempting to focus their thoughts. 

 

On the robot’s display screen, the face shifted from grey to a furious red. Growing thick ebon horns, it became a cartoonish Beelzebub countenance. Its voice changed as well, becoming demonic: dozens of agonized utterances intermingled.  

 

*“HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?”* it asked the inebriated. *“NAKED, HUMILIATED, BRUISED AND BLEARY. WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH YOU? PERHAPS YOU’D LIKE TO DANGLE FOR A WHILE, JUST LIKE YOUR BUDDY MARTY. NO, THAT WOULDN’T MAKE OUR POINT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THERE’S ONE THING THAT WE AT THE SILENT MINORITY BELIEVE IN, IT’S SCHOOL SPIRIT. ISN’T THAT RIGHT, COMRADES?”*

 

As one, the Silent nodded—even Vic. Not that he’d ever cared about any school, but he was becoming hip to the robot’s showmanship. He knew that the little contraption was building up to something. 

 

*“I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU SO-CALLED ATHLETES. GIVE US ONE GOOD ROUND OF YOUR EAST PACIFIC FIGHT SONG AND WE’LL LET YOU GO. YOU MORONS MUST’VE BELCHED IT A THOUSAND TIMES BY NOW, SO WE EXPECT YOU TO ARTICULATE.”*

 

The Squids laughed and grumbled. Some shouted slurred threats. “Eat my dick, robo-faggot!” one yelled. 

 

*“SUCH HOMOPHOBIA. BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOU’RE THE ONE STANDING NAKED IN A CLUSTER OF DUDES. OBVIOUSLY, YOU’RE INTO IT, OR ELSE YOU FUCKERS WOULD HAVE MADE WITH THE LYRICS ALREADY, SO THAT WE CAN ALL GO HOME.”*

 

But the players weren’t having it. And so the four Silent leaders momentarily disappeared. Returning, each clutched a shotgun, pointed authoritatively forward. 

 

*Oh, shit,* Vic thought. *Am I about to view some burst craniums? Should I just start running—somewhere, anywhere—before I become complicit in this bizarre torture scenario? Ah, whatever.* 

 

*“LAST CHANCE,”* the robot bellowed. *“SING YOUR FIGHT SONG NOW!”* 

 

No dice. And so the four leaders fired, deafening in the room’s close quarters. Four jocks flew backward, toppling the rest over like dominoes. But there was no blood, just angry thoracic blotches, which would soon shift to purple, signifying broken ribs. The players screamed and bellowed, and had to be helped back to their feet. 

 

*“THAT’S RIGHT, FUCKERS. THESE HERE SHOTGUNS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO FIRE BEANBAG ROUNDS: TINY PILLOWS FILLED WITH BIRDSHOT. THEY MIGHT NOT KILL YOU, BUT THEY SURE HURT LIKE THE DEVIL. THAT OL’ SING-ALONG DOESN’T SEEM SO BAD NOW, DOES IT? AND A ONE, AND A TWO…”*

 

There came a bit of mumbling and humming, some slurred something or other. 

 

*“C’MON, SQUIDS! Y’ALL CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT! HERE, WHY DON’T I GET YOU STARTED? PURPLE-GREY, OBLITERATE. PURPLE-GREY, THE BEST IN STATE…YOU KNOW THE REST.”*

 

Finally, they performed the fight song. The lyrics, as Vic understood them, went as follows:

 

*Purple-grey, obliterate*

*Purple-grey, the best in state*

*With pride we fight for glory true*

*In sunny skies, in oceans blue*

*Rah, rah, rah, we take the field*

*Go, team, go, with sword and shield*

*EPHS charge!*

 

They looked so stupid there, swaying with their chill-shriveled dongs out, chanting those asinine lyrics. When Vic noticed the four Silent leaders recording the performance with their cellphones, understanding finally dawned. The footage would leak out, and the group would be slandered mercilessly, to the point where they’d think twice before bashing any more human piñatas. 

 

*Well, that’s not so bad, all things considered,* Vic thought. *Man, I thought we’d spend the evening dissolving bodies, or maybe digging out desert graves.* He began to laugh, his mirth quickly terminated by the glares of the Silent. *Man, these dudes really can’t stand human articulations. Maybe I should learn how to talk like that kooky multiple personality robot. Yeah, maybe.* 

 

Having finished their chant, the Squids stood staring slackly. The robot’s countenance receded from the devilish, back into the genderless grey it had started out as. Its speaker-projected voice returned to normal, speaking conciliatorily now: *“Gee, that wasn’t so bad, was it? Had you fellas been so accommodating to begin with, we might have spared ourselves some unpleasantness. Go ahead, get dressed.”*

 

With assistance from the Silent Minority, the jocks concealed their shame. Some of them had the wrong clothes on—too baggy, or slut-tight—but at least their horrible tan lines were gone. 

 

*“We hope that you learned something today,”* the robot said. *“No longer shall the Silent suffer meekly. Remember that factoid in the days to come. Your hateful bullying brought you here, nothing else. Thuggish savagery demands retribution, now and forevermore. The Day of the Introvert shall sprout into an era.*

 

*“Hang around for a while, until one of you has sobered up enough to drive. We wouldn’t want your team to die in a fiery bus crash, ha-ha. Goodbye, friends. Don’t make us pay you another visit.”*

 

As the Silent began exiting, one of them darted forward, shedding his “speak no evil” mask. *Oh, I knew it,* Vic thought. *That’s totally Marty MacNamara.* 

 

“Remember me?” Marty inquired with a cracking shout. His face appeared to thin and stretch, until it seemed to Vic that something demonic peered out of those tormented eye sockets. From his pocket, Marty pulled a butterfly knife, fanning it open single-handedly. Before anybody could think to react, he rushed the nearest player. 

 

*Jab* the knife went, into a Samoan’s carotid. Hand to his neck, the jock face-slapped the floor. Marty screamed triumphantly, and actually licked the blood from his blade before rushing a mulleted ginger, who must have weighted a quarter ton. *Jab, jab, jab,* and a fleshy abdomen became confetti. The ginger screamed, his screeches echoed by his teammates as the Silent fell upon Marty, and wrestled him out of the room. 

 

*Should I call an ambulance?* Vic wondered. In his mind, two Vic-selves argued—the guy he’d been and whatever Vic was becoming. *Nah, fuck ’em. Let those malevolent jerks bleed out.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

During the return drive, the robot paid each Silent Minority member a second visit. It seemed like overkill, but what could Vic do?

 

At any rate, he was presented with more footage shot within his erstwhile residence. Two men, vaguely familiar, ransacked cupboards and closets, floor-strewing their contents. 

 

“We’ll search for twenty minutes,” a balding man with an overbite declared. His voice identified him as Bill, already twice recorded plotting against Vic. *Three strikes, you’re out, Bill.*  

 

“Yeah, what if we find something?” his beanie-wearing accomplice asked. 

 

“That faggot will get a fair trial. Fair, as long as it ends with him in prison or a fuckin’ madhouse.”

 

Mercifully, that short bit seemed to be all that the robot had left. *I wonder what those douchebags were looking for*, Vic thought. *Proof of Knut’s murder? Or have they convinced themselves that I’m guilty of some other crime? That neighborhood’s obsession with me is all kinds of pathetic. Seriously, we need to swerve this bus toward Turquoise Street. Skin those fucks alive.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Though somewhat disappointed, Vic wasn’t surprised to glance down the next morning and discover his doorstep vacant. *That across-the-hall girl is probably too traumatized to cook*, he realized. *I mean, shit, between the horrible footage that robot made her watch and the violence of the jock takedown, she’s probably curled up in the fetal position right now, sobbing like a side-speared sea lion. Luckily, I’m made of sterner stuff.* 

 

He spent the day channel surfing, flipping through newscast after newscast, wondering how their assault would be reported. Hours later, he struck gold. 

 

There was Erin Rodriguez, XBC News, she of the power suit and bob cut. The reporter was somewhat of a celebrity, having broken the story of the Minnesota Corpse Shack a year prior. Now she stood before an institution, whose painted exterior bore the words *EAST PACIFIC HIGH SCHOOL*, beneath which an anthropomorphized purple squid smiled sinisterly. Battling her own burgeoning smirk, the woman attempted a serious demeanor. 

 

“I’m reporting live from East Pacific High School,” she announced, “home to the Squids, football players struggling to live up to their five-times National Championship winning predecessors. 

 

“Last night, this talented group of young athletes faced its greatest challenge yet, far from the gridiron. That’s right, in a tragic turn of events that has left this SoCal community reeling, the entire team was abducted and brutalized by the terrorist group, al-Qaeda.”

 

Had Vic been drinking anything at that moment, it would have gone spraying from his face, replicating insipid sitcom slapstick. *Al-Qaeda?* he thought. *How the hell did they get the credit?*     

 

“The assault resulted in two deaths: Aiono Palamo and Buford ‘Pellet’ Littleton, both of whom succumbed to violent stabbings. Our hearts go out to their families and friends, as their shock segues to mourning. 

 

“Worse, a video hit the Internet, hours ago, featuring the entire team naked and terrified, forced to sing their school fight song.” XBC then aired a brief clip of a performance Vic had caught live—with the genitals fortunately blurred, unlike the video that the Silent had leaked on Skewlclips. “I’m here with star cornerback, Javon Johns. Javon, what can you tell us about your experience?”

 

Javon stumbled forward, his eyes red and lidded between a Kangol and a turtleneck. Whether his blurred oculi stemmed from roofie remnants or fresh blunt sucking, Vic didn’t care to speculate.

 

“Aw, it was crazy,” Javon mumbled. “Niggas run up on us, be like sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, nahm saying? Dudes rocking turbans, waving them AKs, straight thuggin’. Before I knew it, they had us all staggered, like trippin’ over our shoes and shit.”

 

“And what of your slain teammates, Aiono Palamo and Buford Littleton?”

 

“Man, on the real, shit was tragic. I mean…I seen them sliced, man, crazy style. Them’s my peoples, nahm sayin’? Like, I’d have jumped into the mix, fucked them towelheads up, but my mind…it wasn’t workin’ right.”

 

“Yes, apparently the toxicologist found Rohypnol in your urine samples. Tell me, Javon, how did al-Qaeda manage to get an entire football team roofied?”

 

“I can’t remember, yo. I remember football practice, and then…it’s like…nothin’, nah mean? Next thing I know, shit’s straight up bin Laden.”    

 

“Thank you, Javon.” 

 

Vic switched off the TV. 

 

*Seriously?* he thought. *How the hell do you mistake a bunch of geeks in surgical masks for al-Qaeda? Were the roofies that strong? Or is this some kind of face saving dealie? Did the team decide that blaming it on Middle Easterners made them look less pussified? I mean, the whole world’s seen ’em singing with their dicks out. It’s not like they’ll ever live that down, no matter how they try to spin it. Or did XBC News make up the story, desperate for ratings? It doesn’t make sense.* 

 

*Seriously, I thought we were supposed to be sending a message: introverts have united, and will no longer stand for victimization against our kind. Now what? What was the point of it all? If anything, our actions will now lead to some poor immigrants getting jumped. Who’s running this show, anyway?*",1,1770912802.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False
1r2xkqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1r2xkqd/first_trip_report_25_210_with_toddler/,First Trip Report 2/5 - 2/10 with Toddler,"Hey all! We just got back from a 4-park day, 5-night trip to WDW and I am so restless that I wanted to write up a trip report to try and relive the experience as soon as possible. I have learned a ton and lived vicariously through other TR posts so hope this is a useful for some of you too. The last time my wife and I had been to WDW was over 25 years ago and our 4-year old son had never been before so this really felt like a first trip for us all.

**Pre-trip Planning**

For our first trip I wanted to prioritize convenience, and with our son being a toddler I figured we would probably spend most of our time at MK. With that in mind I focused on the deluxe monorails resorts and settled on the Polynesian. To save some money we picked what we thought would be a relatively low-crowd time in early Feb and rented DVC points.  All in all this was a pretty seamless experience and plan to to do the same thing every trip going forward where possible. We must have saved at least $3K and would highly recommend

At the ADR 60 day mark I ended up reserving a Story Book Dining at Artist Point reservation for our check-in night, a mid-afternoon Beak and Barrel our first day, Oga's Cantina on our HS day, and O'Hana breakfast on our check-out day. I knew how expensive these were so didn't want to overdo it, and was also feeling anxious about eating up too much park time and locking ourselves into schedules since I know toddlers can be a bit unpredictable, but figured both bar reservations would be good breaks to rest our feet and a perfect way for us to kill some time in case our little guy had to take a nap (did not realize that we would not be able to bring in the stroller at the time...)

For lightning lanes, I used thrill-data to look at what was available and what I should book first. Based on what I was seeing, I started with our Saturday at HS and booked Slinky Dog, Toy Story mania, ToT, and RotR Individual LL. I know they say to start with your furthest out days but I saw that some times at MK were running out on our first day so I grabbed those next. After that it was fairly easy to round out our final day at MK and our Sunday at Animal Kingdom. All in all it, with a 7-day window and what was supposed to be a relatively low crowd weekend, we were able to get pretty much everything we wanted. Going in with a rough plan of how I wanted to prioritize my days based on existing availability made this a breeze. I would also highly recommend making sure you have at least one LL right about the time you enter the parks or shortly after if you plan to rope drop, so you can quickly start to book higher tier LL's and stack them up for later in the day.

**Thursday, Feb 5th**

We used some points to fly down on the 4th to spend a day with a local friend, so we were able to save money on the flight as well as transportation from the airport and to Poly. After checking in and grabbing a quick snack at Captain cooks to tide us over until dinner, we ended up settling into our room, wandering around the hotel, and checking out the new tower.

My first impression of the room was that it was fun but very dated. Very colorful paintings that set a fun vibe, and my son enjoyed the murphy beds and how cool it was that they came down from the walls, but you could tell this was one of the first resorts built on property. We ended up getting a room in Pago Pago which turned out to be perfect for us since it is so close to the TTC and made getting to and from the Monorail a breeze. Not sure if you can request a hut but I would highly recommend it if possible, unless you value being closer to the pools. The beds were very comfortable and all of us slept great at night and during naps. Our room also had a mini fridge and freezer  which made storing groceries much easier. I had originally held off on getting milk because I had read reviews saying they only had glass door coolers.

The new tower lobby is GORGEOUS. Would love to see what those rooms look like, and I think if we came back and weren't going to spend so much time at the parks, I would definitely consider staying there next.

I briefly considered taking the public transportation to Wilderness Lodge for our Story Book Dining res but it was 45 degrees and would have been a 40 minute trek so we decided to uber. I knew I wanted to star the trip off with some magic and had read this was one of the best character meals, especially in terms of food quality.  It was an awesome kicking off our time with some great character interactions, but the food was a little underwhelming unfortunately. The mushroom soup, shrimp, and meatballs were decent enough, and I enjoyed the pork shank, but my wife found all the appetizers and her Herb Chicken to be almost inedible. She can have pretty snobbish takes when it comes to food so take it with a grain of salt. Our toddler loved the experience though. A bit scared of the queen but all the cast members and characters made it an awesome time. I don't think we would do it again but would recommend it if you have a kid that love Snow White.

**Friday, Feb 6th**

Magic Kingdom Day. This was our earliest start, but still a bit later than what I was used to growing up. I had always been an early riser and love rope dropping, staying in the parks open to close. My wife however loves her sleep and my toddler thankfully doesn't wake up super early most days. Generally we woke up every day this trip at around 7:30, and had a nice leisurely morning eating some breakfast in our room and we were out the door anywhere between 8:20 and 9.

Today we were barely able to take advantage of early entry by getting inside the gates at around 8:45. After starting our trip off with the Carousel, we headed over to our first lightning lane Dumbo around 9:25, riding barnstormer while we waited for our time slot. Afterwards we had some time before a SDMT LL so we slowly walked around a bit, caught a walk-on Little Mermaid and got a Creme Brulé Croissant and Coffee at Gaston's. I had heard good things about the Croissant and this somehow exceeded expectations. Perfect flakiness, and as long as you didn't get a huge bite of the creme filling, it wasn't too sweet. My wife hates sweet treats so I wasn't expecting her to like it but she loved it too

From there we slowly made our way to our other LLs and took in the scenery with some filler attractions that were awesome change's of pace. I could imagine the Enchanted Tiki room being the perfect way to get out of the Florida heat. In our case it gave us a chance to rest and get out of the cold haha.

After that we mobile walked up and maybe waited for 10 minutes to eat at Skipper Canteen. We had brought some food in so we ended up sharing the Lost and Found soup which was a green curry with jalapenos, the Jungle green salad, and the Duck Fried Rice. I had also heard good things, but also knew that MK did not have a great reputation when it came to food so my expectations were not very high. I am so happy we tried it. Easily our best meal of the entire trip. I was not expecting my wife to truly enjoy any of the food at Disney and she LOVED the fried rice.

After another LL at Haunted Mansion and some shopping, my wife too my son back to the Poly for a nap. I had hoped we could get by with him napping in his stroller, but I didn't want to push it and figured we may as well take advantage of staying at the Poly, but I stayed since I had a LL for Tron around 2 and Beak and Barrel at 3.

After trying out the ""solo"" experience for a couple of hours, I can absolutely see the appeal. This was one of the most zen-like and relaxing experiences of my life. I slowly made my way around the park while I waited for Tron, checking out little shops around main street, looking at the surroundings, and riding things that I knew my son and wife would be bored with like Carousel of Progress (fun, relaxing experience!). After Tron, I slowly made my way over to Beak and Barrel, grabbing some snacks along the way like the Spring Rolls (I got 1 of each, loved both).

I started to feel a little anxious after checking in for Beak and Barrel, since while I appreciate why people would go Solo, I also started feeling a little self-conscious about being by myself surrounded by families in a ""kid's park."" However after I was shown in (thankfully I was placed at the bar), and about 1 minute after I got there, another solo traveler was placed next to me. The next 45 minutes were awesome. We ended up chatting about our lives, why we were there alone, chatted with the bartenders about best restaurants in WDW, and just in general had a great time. I started with the Barrel's Ablaze which was a little sweet for my taste but better than some other drinks I've had so far, and second drink was one of the blonde ales. Between all the walking and the sun, after leaving I had the perfect level of buzz and made my way over to the people mover for a nice relaxing trip around Tomorrowland.  Even without the LL, the line was only about 25 minutes long, but I just enjoyed being in the moment, people watching, and soaking in the experience.

The rest of the day was equally as relaxing. We shopped a bit, had a few more LL, grabbed a turkey leg, mickey pretzel and hotdog from Liberty Market Tavern and walked over to the Starlight Parade and ate while we waited for about 45 minutes. I grabbed a Coconut and Pineapple dole whip while we waited.  Awesome parade. I think had we known it would come back towards Liberty Square we would have waited there.

Last LL of the day was Peter Pan, and then we made our way back for Fireworks, and left for the Poly via Monorail, getting back around 10.

We may have gotten lucky, but this was just an absolute incredible way to start our trip. No tantrums and I felt like we were able to try all the food and rides I was looking forward to, plus staying up for fireworks with a 4 year old is always a gamble (Mid-day break at the hotel made it possible for sure)

**Saturday, Feb 7th**

Hollywood Studios Day. After a 7:30 wake up and breakfast in the room, we ended up getting on the bus to HS around 9, getting to the park around 9:20. After riding Toy Story Mania (Awesome way to start the day with a kid!) we had some more breakfast at Ronto Roasters. The breakfast Roaster lived up to expectations. The fruit cup was good enough, and the overnight oats was good as well.

We made our way over to our Tower of Terror LL which was the only ride I was seriously worried about when it came to getting our son to ride. But he was a champ and stuck with it. We had to reassure him that it was not real and they were ""just joking"" about ghosts. No crying at all, and the ride pictures looked incredible. But afterwards he said he didn't like it and that he was scared. Just happy it didn't deter him from riding anything else.

After that we rode Slinky Dog (son did not enjoy this either. He ended up loving SDMT after we went on it for the second time on the last day so i wonder if he would have grown to like it as well, but we never got the chance), watched the Frozen Sing along (Awesome show! Highly recommend it for slowing down the day and getting out of the sun. Hilarious), and then ate lunch. I originally steered us towards docking bay 7, but after looking at pictures on the menu, my wife thought it looked ""horrendous"" and we pivoted to getting hot dogs at Dockside Diner. I'm glad we did because those were delicious. We tried a standard dog, a Pretzel dog, and a BLT dog. All 3 were great.

From there the plan was to do Mickey & Minnie's, but it was down so I ended up walking around with our son in the stroller to try and get him to nap for a bit. He refused, but it gave us a good chance to have my wife sit and rest, and for me to walk around and soak in the scenery. I saw some awesome details around the park and caught a few cool character interactions. Unfortunately my son never napped so we gave up after about an hour, but by then MMRR was back up so we rode that.

We then made our way to our Rise of the Resistance LL and rode what I had been looking forward to all year. And I was totally completely amazed. Just an absolutely incredible experience as a lifelong star wars fan. And experiencing that magic with my son who had been experiencing magic all trip so far, was extra special. Unfortunately he was a bit scared at points, especially the part where you are in ""jail,"" but he got through it and ended up talking about it as though he loved it afterwards.

We next had a reservation at Oga's cantina, but as luck would have it, our little guy ended up falling right asleep so we canceled and ended up walking around galaxies edge for about an hour.

One funny interaction during this: there were two storm troopers hassling a group of guests and asking about their business. One located our stroller and walked over saying ""What do we have over here. State your business"" and then peering into our stroller where our son was zonked out. My wife nicely stated that he was napping, and he gingerly backed up a bit and sort of whispered wit his hand expressions ""woops, sorry."" I think if he had woken up, he would have had the surprise of his life, and while it may have been painful, this was one of the funniest things we had happen to us all trip. In general, Galaxy's edge is INCREDIBLE. I am so impressed by the cast members and people in suits that go around and make this a special experience for everyone. That little interaction will be something I think back on for the rest of my life. Later on once he woke up, a trooper came by and saw that he was wearing a storm trooper shirt, gave him a little nod and raised fist of approval and said ""for the first order."" Later in the trip when I was asking him what his favorite ride was so far, he said ""seeing the storm troopers.""

After all that we rode Alien Swirling Saucers (my sons actual favorite ride of the day), and ate at Roundup Rodeo, which I ended up booking the day before. All of us had a great time. The food was decent. Not incredible BBQ and the brisket was a little dry, but you get all you can eat, the biscuits were incredible, and the watermelon seemed fresh. I think next time we will try and go in a little hungrier and get more bang for our buck, but would absolutely consider going back. Incredible server, and the interaction with ""Andy' was awesome seeing with my son.

After that we rode Smugglers Run and then left the park before Fantasmic ended to beat the crowd home, getting back around 8:45.

One closing thought on Smugglers Run. I had read some so-so reviews, but I had an absolute BLAST on this ride. Granted, I was one of the pilots, but I feel like the theming and experience was incredible, including the queue. Looking forward to see how it changes with the Mandalorian update. Originally they had put my son as my co-pilot, but thankfully he asked not to be so someone switched.

**Sunday, Feb 8th**

Animal Kingdom to Epcot Day. I wasn't sure if this was going to be feasible, but after seeing the first two days go by pretty smoothly with a nap and knowing he could nap successfully in his stroller, we proceeded with our only park hop of the trip.

I had originally booked our LL for Kilimanjaro for park open at 8 am, knowing that this is the best time to see the animals. I also knew we would need to quickly book LL for Remy's at Epcot. But I also knew that I would have a full blown mutiny on my hands if I tried to wake everyone up at 6:30 after two full days. So we ended up following our typical schedule and ended up getting on the bus to AK around 9 and to the park around 9:20 or so.  Thankfully, this was no problem showing up 30-40 minutes after our LL window was up, we had a great safari, leisurely walked over to Satuli-Cantina for Cheeseburger Pod and coffee, and then rode Nav'i River. We then strolled over to Zootopia and by then it was 11:30 and we decided to make the move over to Epcot.

At this point in the trip, to keep my wife happy and alive in the middle of 4 full park days, I booked her a massage at Grand Floridian Spa, while me and my son took the bus over to Epcot. For anyone looking for a way to make a partner happy who may not love spending all their time in a park, this is a masterstroke. Not only did she have a nice relaxing solo experience and a break from the action, but I was able to get some awesome 1:1 time with my son and just go at our own pace. The first thing we did was walk through the Moana Way of Water. This may have been the moment from our trip that I will remember for the rest of my life. Seeing how happy he was playing around in the water, feeling like he was controlling the splashes and truly experiencing magic was so special. Kids grow up fast. Every parent I talk to always talks about  how its important to cherish those little moments, especially at this age. And this really hit me all at once. I have such a vivid mental image of that moment with him, and I'm so grateful for it. The attraction itself was a perfect way to cool off at the peak of the hot afternoon. Awesome engineering on Disney's part, and a memory that will live with me forever. I hope it will be a core memory for him.

We then did a Figment LL (we had bought a Figment Gold book earlier in the trip so he knew who figment was and was equally excited for this), walked around international showcase. I grabbed a Gruyere Croquet Grilled Cheese (delicious) and we shared a Strawberry Dole Whip Cone (Equally delicious). After cooling off a bit more on the Mexico boat ride, we ended up doing a full lap around the lake while he napped.

While he napped I tried the Wagyu Bun in Japan, all the soda's at Club Cool (Maybe I'm a freak but I actually didn't really mind Beverly at all. I liked it a lot more than some of the other soda's that were just too sugary).

The rest of the day was nice and relaxing. My wife finally met back up with us around 5. We did Soaring and I did a solo Cosmic Rewind LL. We ate ate Teppan Edo which was a lot of fun, but just thought the food was okay. I don't know if I would recommend since you can get the same experience at pretty much any hibachi restaurant, but my son loved watching the show for the first time. Unfortunately due to the heat or maybe because he had eaten too much and was too hyper, he ended up feeling sick and spit up in the restaurant. We ended up canceling our plans to do Remy's afterwards and watch Luminous and just went home. Thankfully he was feeling fine afterwards.

Full Ride List:  *8 rides in total. Kilimanjaro LL, Navi River Journey LL, Zootopia LL, Moana, Figment LL, Tres Caballeros,  Cosmic rewind LL, Soaring LL*

**Monday, Feb 9th**

Final park day. Magic Kingdom. We had done so much on Friday that I originally thought we might park hop and do what we missed at Epcot in the afternoon, but to keep things simple and slow paced, we decided to just hang out at MK, soak in the views and details and ride some of the things we missed on our first day, re ride the ones we loved, and just end on a high note with the classic.

I won't go into as much detail here because this was more of the same. Just a few call outs:

\-Mickey's Phillharmagic was delightful. Any families coming with young kids especially, would highly recommend slowing things down with some of the shows. There was nearly no wait, and my son ended up loving these even more than some of the rides. Even after 4 full park days, I was never that tired because we were able to break up the day with these rests, and I think also contributed to our toddler having essentially zero meltdowns.

\-Magic Moment: While we were in our vehicle waiting to start, Aladdin and Jasmine came up and actually got in to ride! Jasmine even got into the car directly in front of us. Not sure how often this happens but this just felt like a special moment, and definitely was one of the reasons that Aladdin was my son's favorite ride by the end of the trip.

\-This day, i joined my wife and toddler for a post-lunch nap back at the hotel. Prior to the nap though we ate at Kona Cafe. We shared the pork belly noodles, Potstickers, and Bao Buns w/ Hibiscus tea. The potstickers were pretty dang good, but we hated the sauce, which was way too sweet for our tastes. The Pork belly noodles were probably our least favorite meal of the entire trip unfortunately. My wife had one bite and gave up, and I ate about half.

\-We ended up going back and catching our Tiana's LL afterwards. Our lightning lane was for 2:05 - 3:05, so I was a little worried about being too late since we ended up napping and getting back to the park around 4:30. By the time we made it back to the ride it was 4:50. But we had no issues getting on, just under 2 hours late.

\-We ended up going back to Skipper Canteen for dinner and ordering the exact same meal as the first day. So yummy. I also ended up going back for spring rolls after and some Orange Dole whip at Sunshine Terrace.

\-Our final two rides of the trip were Monsters Inc Laugh Floor and Tomorrowland Speedway. I have to say, the Monsters Inc show was incredible. I know it must be old at this point, but I am just amazed at how fast the comedians are in that show to interact with the audience the way they do.

**Tuesday, Feb 10th**

Check-out day. The only thing on our itinerary was a 9am O'hana reservation, and a mid afternoon flight back. O'hana was a ton of fun. The food was ok, but having one last chance to meet some characters, especially Stitch felt like a perfect way to wrap up an awesome trip. I also realized that this was the only time we actually saw a Mickey character up close so that also felt like a fitting finale.

  
**Post-trip Closing Thoughts**

It's hard to compare to how Disney may have changed over the years since this was effectively all of our first times at WDW. But I will say that it felt like the magic was still here. The cast members were amazing, the crowd behavior seemed okay, and overall this was one of our best vacations ever. Even though it was a ""low crowd"" weekend, it also felt PACKED at times. However despite that, it never felt unbearable, and it was the app made mobile ordering and walk-up dining a breeze.

Lightning lane was an absolute must, especially with a toddler, and especially if you don't plan to rope drop. It is costly which I will break down in a little, but as you can see, we were pretty much able to hit every ride we wanted to, and the longest line we had to wait in was probably 20 minutes for Pooh bear since that ride was down pretty much all day. 

Favorite Rides: For me this is a toss up between Rise and Guardians of the galaxy. Experience  wise, Rise of the resistance is going to be tough to beat, but Cosmic Rewind was just an absolute incredible ride. I didn't feel sick at all.  My son is a bit fickle. It went from being ""seeing the storm troopers"" to ""riding the elevator"" but now that we are home, whenever I ask him what his favorite was he goes back to Dumbo and Aladdin. For my wife, she went back to Kilimanjaro.

However, I’ve noticed that when choosing alternatives like almond butter, sunflower seed butter, or tahini, the toast tends to feel much drier. As someone who’s gluten intolerant, this is even more noticeable since gluten-free toast breaks apart more easily than regular wheat toast.

Adding jam can help with moisture, but it doesn’t offer the same flavor or texture as banana. While banana does add some moisture even on toasted bread, I honestly don’t notice a huge difference between using jam or banana. And of course, toast pairs well with morning coffee, but not everyone enjoys the same kind. When you add a flavored coffee loaded with syrup or sugar, it can easily overpower the entire breakfast.

I’m a 26F relocating to Baltimore for work at Johns Hopkins Hospital and would really appreciate some local insight on where to live.

My top priorities are:  
• **Safety** (I’ll likely be coming home from the hospital at varying hours)  
• **Reasonable commute to Johns Hopkins Hospital** (ideally 15–20 minutes or easy public transit access)  
• Walkability to things like coffee shops, groceries, gym, etc.

I’d love recommendations on:  
• Neighborhoods that feel safe and are good for young professionals  
• Specific apartment buildings you’ve had good experiences with  
• Property management companies that are reputable

I’ve also heard that some management groups in Baltimore have pretty bad reputations — are there any I should definitely avoid?

Lastly, are there any local resources I should check out when apartment hunting (Facebook groups, neighborhood associations, rental sites beyond Zillow/Apartments.com, etc.)?

1r2xcrk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2xcrk,I Challenged Myself to Design One Skateboard a Week,"I originally wanted to be an illustrator, but right after college, I leaned into graphic design because I felt my design work was stronger than my drawings at the time. So illustration kind of took a back seat. I've always been drawing, and everywhere I've worked, I would have sticky notes covering my desk with random doodles.

With freelance work slowing down a bit, I gave myself a project: **design one new skateboard deck every week**. The long-term goal is to maybe design a deck for a pro skater or a skate company someday (no idea how realistic that is, but that’s the dream). At the very least, it keeps me making stuff.

I’ve also been turning them into Shorts, TikToks, and Reels while I learn Premiere Pro. It’s a good excuse for me to work on storytelling. I created all the drawings in Procreate, and then I brought them into Photoshop for the branding, color adjustments, and light editing.

These are the first four boards. Instead of posting one per week here, I’m thinking of sharing them in batches every four weeks so there’s more to look at in each post. That’s different from how I’m posting on social, but it probably makes more sense here.

Need advice from which step should I start.,"I’m 19M and I honestly feel like I’ve been going downhill for years, especially after my first sleep paralysis episode. Before that I wasn’t some genius student, but I could at least sit down, study and function normally. After that, my grades started slipping and I began zoning out a lot in class. Over time my attention span became almost nonexistent. Now I can’t focus on reading or listening for more than a minute unless it’s something extremely interesting. I make detailed plans in my head but never follow through. I start learning skills and quit within days once the excitement fades or I notice a flaw. If I don’t see quick progress or money potential, I lose interest completely. I doom scroll 12 to 14 hours a day and stay in bed most of the time. I’ve never felt disciplined. I talk loudly, interrupt people, overexplain things and daydream constantly, making scenarios in my head. I zone out even during prayers and only pray after my parents remind me repeatedly. I forget simple things like my keys but remember random details like exact conversations from years ago. I’m emotional, impulsive, overthink everything, can’t handle criticism well, and my mood can change within seconds. My friends say I can be rage baited instantly. I want things perfect and probably have OCD traits. I often act first and think about consequences later. Even before anxiety got bad I struggled with focus, but after it everything became much worse.

My anxiety feels very physical. I get chest tightness, heart palpitations, random body shivers and internal shaking. During arguments my whole body trembles, and even after it’s over I stay on edge, scanning every road and every person like something bad is about to happen. It feels like my brain is constantly in surveillance mode. I’m scared to drive because I think I’ll crash into someone. I’m afraid of stray dogs biting me. When I walk outside I sometimes feel detached and not fully present, and I trip over small things. My sleep is terrible. I rarely sleep more than 4 to 5 hours and it never feels refreshing. My brain just doesn’t shut off. When I’m about to sleep I get sudden falling sensations or feel like the bed is moving. I’ve had multiple sleep paralysis episodes. After the first one my academic performance dropped and never really recovered. Heavy bass music energizes me a lot, but sad music pulls my mood down fast. I’m not good at sports like cricket or football, and even in e sports I react slowly and get eliminated quickly. My confidence has taken a big hit.

Medication hasn’t been straightforward either. I’ve been on Reline, an SSRI, for 15 days and haven’t noticed any change yet. I tried alprazolam for two days. The first day I slept after about an hour. The second day I couldn’t sleep even after three hours. Ritalin once made me fall asleep for about 20 minutes. Vyvanse increased my physical anxiety symptoms like palpitations and tension. Tea and coffee also make me more anxious. It honestly feels like my nervous system is stuck in fight or flight mode and my brain never powers down. I feel like I’m failing in different areas of life and slowly declining. I just want to know if anyone has dealt with this kind of mix of anxiety, ADHD type symptoms, OCD traits, constant hypervigilance, sleep problems and emotional dysregulation and actually improved. What helped long term? Did you focus on anxiety first or ADHD first? I don’t want to just be sedated. I want to feel stable and functional.",1,1770912237.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

1r2xa3b,https://i.redd.it/ljcyywqx63jg1.jpeg,Siolim Pearl of Union - Pulse,"Was super excited to get my hands on the final drop in the inner pearl series. 

This is from Ratnagiri estate & is one of 13 nano lots released in the series. 

Expected to taste a very fruity and citrus forward brew but ended up with something that felt much more basic. Both the aroma and notes are nothing to rave about. 

Don't get me wrong this is still great coffee. It has a good body & I can definitely taste notes of green grapes. 

However, it just strikes me as more of a typical light roasted speciality cup in terms of brightness, mouthfeel and tasting notes rather than something that is worth coveting.

Have you tried it too? I'd love nothing more than for others to have enjoyed this more than I did. ",5,1770912119.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

We have always remained pretty close throughout the years and at the time where I met her, she was job hopping and she had mentioned to me that she wanted to be a barista as well, so I encouraged her to do that and eventually she started working at the coffee shop as well. 

Before she was working at the coffee shop, she was job hopping a bit and at one point she was working a minimum wage job and was complaining about being broke so I introduced her to my side hustle where we were making thousands of dollars (we still do it to this day) and I did that because I didn't want to see her be miserable or suffer and while at the same time, encouraging her to work at the coffee shop. 

The only downside of the coffee shop is that we couldn't have piercings or nails and when someone is alternative, we obviously want to express ourselves in that way, so after a while while of the coffee shop, I left to work in the pharmacy and not long after she started complaining of not being able to have piercings which I fully understood, but she also was feeling insecure and ranting to me about how she didn't go to college and felt behind. I also didn't go to college so I could relate to that.

So I encouraged her to work in the pharmacy and now she works in the pharmacy. I have always pretty much tried to help her guide through life and be there for her. If she had any questions, which she has asked me tons and tons of questions about the pharmacy even questions i don't have an answer to, but I've always been there patiently answering her as best as I can.

But recently she brought up to me that she is upset because she says I'm copying her makeup style specifically copying freckles that we placed with our eyeliner, which yes I'm not going to lie. I did take inspiration from her on that but other than that we do our make up pretty much like every other emo girl, lol with big winged eyeliner and lashes, and inner corner eye eyeliner. She says that we are going to start looking the same as well because we have the same piercing set up. We both have snake bite piercings and eyebrow piercings. but i told her we are different ethnicities, we arent gonna look the same at all. we have way different features.

But I also mentioned to her that working at the coffee shop we weren't allowed to do those things so obviously now that we can we're going to get the piercings we've always wanted. It just makes me upset at the same time because I feel like throughout the years I have done so much for her and I have always been someone that was there for her and helping her guide herself through life.

The pharmacy she is currently working at is way worse than mine and I was going to try and help her get a job where I'm working, but I don't think I will do that anymore. I apologize to her because I didn't want to invalidate her feeling if she's not upset over me copying her eyeliner freckles and her piercing set up, but I just don't think it is worth getting upset about? I would understand if I was copying literally everything and becoming obsessive, but I am not copying her at all. Just took some inspiration from the way she was placing her eyeliner freckles and I had got the piercings I always wanted to get.

tl;dr : my friend is upset because she says I'm copying her makeup style, but I have helped her tremendously throughout the years",1,1770912105.0,AITAH,13,0.67,False

Not a casual “one cup a day” person, more like iced in the afternoon, hot in the morning, milk-based drinks when they feel fancy.

I came across the Tastyle single‑serve coffee maker with a built‑in detachable milk frother, and it actually checked more boxes than I expected. It works with both K‑cups and ground coffee, has multiple cup sizes, and the water tank is big enough that it doesn’t need refilling every day. I also liked that it fits a full travel mug, since they’re always rushing between calls.

What made it feel gift‑worthy (instead of just another appliance) is the frother being built in, it turns a quick coffee break into something a bit more “treat-like” without extra tools on the counter.

Curious if anyone here has gifted something similar to a coffee‑obsessed friend or partner and how it landed. I’m aiming for practical but still thoughtful, not something that ends up unused after a week.",1,1770911950.0,Gifts,0,1.0,False

1r2x6fi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2x6fi,Raised at $33M… now doing $50.75M in revenue… still not profitable.,"This company raised at a $33M valuation.

They’re now doing $50.75M in revenue.

And they’re still not profitable.

Revival Rugs raised on Republic in 2023 at a $33M valuation cap (SAFE).

Latest annual numbers:

• 2024 Revenue: $50.75M  
• 2023 Revenue: $27.20M  
• YoY Growth: +86.6%  
• Gross Profit: $24.79M  
• Operating Expenses: $54.74M  
• Net Loss: -$3.98M  
• 35 employees  

This is a direct-to-consumer washable rug brand. No physical retail stores. Strong brand presence. Riding the washable/home refresh trend that’s grown fast over the past few years.

Now here’s the part that makes this interesting:

At $50.75M in trailing revenue, that $33M valuation cap sits well under 1x revenue.

You almost never see sub-1x revenue for a consumer brand growing ~87% at this scale.

But —

They’re still losing money.  
Operating expenses are heavy.  
Consumer home goods is competitive.  
Paid acquisition costs matter.

So what is this?

Undervalued because growth exploded after the raise?

Or correctly discounted because profitability isn’t there yet?

If they opened a round today at $33M, does it fill instantly?

Curious how others see this one.

Not financial advice.

For those unfamiliar with my post history, 75 yo BPD mom has been in skilled nursing since June of 2024. She has vascular dementia (mostly short term memory loss), chronic leukemia, and COPD - but the major issue is that she’s completely immobile due to a combo of extreme obesity and non-compliance with physical therapy. She hasn’t been out of bed since summer 2024 (unless you count transfer to a gurney as being out of bed).

Over the past ten or so months she’s developed chronic anemia requiring a number of blood transfusions. Her hem-onc thinks an ongoing gastro bleed is the cause. Getting her in to a gastroenterologist has been a task because she won’t sit in a wheelchair, refusing for a million unreasonable reasons. If she allowed the chair, it’d be a quick ten minute transport to a local hospital. But, because it’s bed or bust, the only place she can be seen is an hour from her nursing home (30 mins from me) at the big regional hospital.

I saw her last week and she laid there with the blankets over her face for most of the visit - except for when I’d ply her with coffee and a plain donut. According to all of her nurses and her roommate, “corpse chic” is her default state now.

I understand that she’s miserable and depressed and adrift…but she’s been some version of that list for as long as I can remember (even when she could walk and make new memories).

Now for the reason I’m posting. The gastro appointment is today at 2. I am struggling with whether or not to go. I worked to get this appointment on the books because she should be seen. I can advocate for her I guess - but so can the aide going with her. I can discuss options with the docs but honestly nothing much will happen today.

I’m tired. I’m over it. She’s not fighting for her health so wtf am I even doing fighting for her?

But there’s also the guilt of not being there when she’s presented to a new doctor in a scary hospital for a new and possibly very serious problem. Honestly, at her size and with her comorbidity and compliance issues, even if they do find something, would it be treatable with the usual interventions like scopes or surgeries? Likely not.

I think my biggest stumbling block is the fear of dealing with the worst version of my mother. When she’s stressed she’s at her most unfiltered and abusive.

So Valentine’s Day is around the corner and I’m single this year 😄 Instead of sitting at home scrolling reels and pretending it’s “just another day,” I thought why not see if someone else is in the same boat.

I’m a 22-year-old college student, pretty easygoing. Into cars, bikes, music, random deep talks, and just enjoying good company without any pressure or expectations. Not looking for anything intense — just a casual meetup like coffee, a walk, or grabbing food and laughing about how overrated Valentine’s Day can be.

If you’re also single and would rather spend the day actually doing something instead of dodging couples everywhere, feel free to DM. We can plan something simple in a public place and keep it comfortable for both of us.

Worst case: we make a new friend.  

Best case: we save each other from a boring Valentine’s 😌

1r2x49v,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1r2x49v/parents_roommate_might_be_trying_to_drive_me_out/,Parents' roommate might be trying to drive me out of the house,"Lengthy rant incoming. TL;DR at the bottom.

I (22F) recently finished college a few months ago and I've been living at home while trying to get a job in my field. My parents' roommate has been making remarks about how my parents have no future because they're spending all their money on my education, how they should stop paying my tuition and let me work until I can afford it, and more recently, after graduating with a hard science degree, how I should look for jobs as a truck driver or as a server since I'm struggling to find a job in my field. He's gotten in the middle of family conflicts, accused me of not respecting my mother, once scolded me for 10 minutes straight while calling me ""infantile"", and then claimed I wasn't ""open"" enough emotionally to be looking for a spouse because I grey-rock him and he assumes I act like that towards everybody. When I got engaged, he told my mom it wouldn't last.

Since finishing college and moving back home, he's told me repeatedly to stop making noise in the morning because it ""disrespects my mom"" (by which he means making breakfast; he usually comes out around the same time to make coffee, anyway) and complained to my mom about how I frequently ask her where things are (I haven't lived here in a while, so I naturally have to ask where things go, like cooking ingredients and appliances). It got to the point where my parents finally intervened and set boundaries with him. Since then, most criticisms have stopped aside from the comments about how I should go look for a job, even if it's outside my field (which I have been doing, I just can't handle being a truck driver or a server).

Also, a few months prior, he was offended at the idea that I'd have to wear the hijab around the house when he was present and he basically expected special treatment and that I should uncover my hair in front of him because he wouldn't assault or harass me, as if that's why I wear hijab. He got mad at me when I told my mom I wouldn't be able to sit at a table where there would be alcohol present for New Year's Eve (I'm a Muslim convert; I never told them not to drink, just that I wasn't permitted to sit at the table) and he accused me of shoving my religion down their throats. A little while later, my mom bought me a crescent moon shaped lamp in preparation for Ramadan and he lost it, saying that I was domineering over the entire house with my religion and that there were so many criticisms about me and my religion he was holding back from mentioning. Mind you, I never said anything when my family set up a Christmas tree and put up Christmas decorations, nor did I feel inclined to. He often tries to lecture me about how I'm not following my religion properly and calls me a ""neophyte"", even though he himself isn't Muslim.

Here's what's currently going on. I have to make up missed fasts from last Ramadan (I recently recovered from gastritis which went on for 2 years and I was unsure of my limits, so I didn't fast but now I know for sure I can handle it health-wise) and that means I have to wake up around 5:30AM every morning to eat or else it'd be a really rough day. I put ice cubes in a Ziploc bag the night before so the fridge's ice machine doesn't make noise and I try to be fast so that I don't make too much sound for too long. For the past couple weeks, since I started fasting, he's been becoming increasingly irritable towards me and my mom. He stopped making small talk and I can tell from the way he walks and acts that he's annoyed with us. This morning, my bagel got stuck in the toaster which made a bit more noise than usual. When he came out of his room, I said ""good morning"", and he just glared at me and didn't say it back. He turned on the coffee maker and went back to his room. Ironically, that coffee maker makes even more noise than I do.

I think he's mad at me for making noise in the morning but there's not much I can do; these fasts are mandatory. I lived in the ""party dorm"" in college and I learned to accomodate myself by wearing earplugs and sleeping with a YouTube video in the background. I don't understand why he expects the house to revolve around him. Since before I started waking up early, he's been going to bed at 8 pm (sometimes 7) and my parents speak in hushed whispers and don't turn on the TV after that. He doesn't have a regular job that demands him to wake up at a set time; he works as a contractor. He also sleeps during the day. I would estimate he gets at least 12-14 hours of sleep a day combined.

TL;DR: I feel like my parents' roommate dislikes me as a person and wants me out of the house so that he can do whatever he wants because my parents are more inclined to appease him and his moods than I am. I think he resents me because of my religious practices and my relationship with my parents. I can't help it that I have to make breakfast early in the morning and I've already done so much to accommodate him yet he refuses to accommodate himself by getting a white noise machine or wearing earplugs. Whenever he walks into the living room, I can feel the energy shift and I start clenching my jaw and tensing my shoulders. I have nowhere to go; I don't have a job or even a car.

No bouquets coming in this year.,"For many years, I received flowers on this cheesy date. I’m practical. I splurge on things I like. But I was always the one who appreciated flowers on this day.

Some say I’m a strong woman, capable of doing things my way (yes, Miley). And I am. But still… over the years, I received them. And they made me feel loved. Seen. Chosen. Even when they cost 3x more on this day.

Last year, I got a dried bouquet from an ex. She probably knew it wouldn’t work out. I guess she also learned she won’t be giving me one again.

There was a point I thought, “Should I just date someone so I can give them flowers too?” I did, actually, last year too, gave flowers to someone dear. She said we’re friends for life only.

**This year, I’m not asking for flowers.**

Instead, I did things that were out of my ordinary life.

I work from home and barely see people. So I enrolled in a gym, just to have daily conversations. My coach messages me asking what time I’m coming in. See? Daily messages. Haha.

I ride my bike on weekends, secretly hoping for a meet-cute. Bikers are the friendliest. A simple “good morning” and a nod from strangers feels surprisingly warm.

I booked a flight. Not to see someone. Just because I can. (Though yes, I met someone from Reddit once for drive-thru coffee. It was nice. Simple. (Hi!)

I downloaded the yellow app again. Talked to someone instantly. She asked if I was into ONS. Honestly, I’d rather drink bottomless mojitos at TGIF and wake up with a headache than wake up asking myself, “What have I done?”

I met up with a wlw couple, old friends. They invited me to their Sunday date. Coffee, walking around high street, 1-for-1 gelato (no, I did not buy two cups after a gassy Harlan coffee). It was wholesome. It was good.

I went to museums alone. Rolled my eyes at couples. Then realized I was actually enjoying my own company.

I did food crawls. My stomach tapped out early.  
I rode a motorcycle through Metro traffic. Smelled like smog after. Got scared over the big trucks and buses. Clenched my legs on the driver. Would recommend. lol

I’m planning my first solo movie date tomorrow or this weekend. Debating between a love story or horror. Honestly… probably horror.

I’ve been eating alone. Grocery shopping alone. Traveling alone.

**And it’s peaceful.**

I said I would live largely this year. So I am. I’ve booked two more local trips with friends. One just to run. Another one this weekend, just to hike.

**None of this is about finding love.**  
**It’s about being in love with myself.**

So if I pass by that flower store tomorrow, maybe I’ll buy myself a bouquet.  
Or maybe I’ll buy a bottle of gin.

**Either way, life is still amazing.**

I made plans for a museum of the town's history, specific art stores, really good restaurants, etc and it was a big hit. Traveling is her favorite thing and this was a smaller, more local 1 day version, essentially.

Anyway, I had not intended to replicate it this year but it's what she wants. This years town will be Lancaster (we've been there before but just to stop and eat and the Park City Mall but not much else). I was hoping the residents could fill me in on the best things to do, see, etc with consideration that it is winter, I already have lunch and dinner planned out, and purchased tickets for an evening show at the Fulton.

I saw in this subreddit there will be a coffee and art crawl. That is her sort of thing so probably will try to pencil that in. The other ideas I'm considering is doing a thrift store run and a jewelry hop (and let her pick something out because it's also Valentine's).

She was my mirror, she showed me how fucked up I am, when I was hurting her, when I couldn’t change the messed up things I did throughout our relationship.

I have so many issues that are unresolved and so much baggage and I wished it won’t mess that up, but it did, and it always messes up everything, I fucked up my career multiple times and messed up all my relationships and I ran away from therapy cause I was too scared to talk about anything.

1r2wxng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1r2wxng/love_spell_im_about_to_do/,Love spell I'm about to do,"Hii, I'm posting this mainly to get some feedback since I'm still learning about love spells.

This is a 2 day/step spell, I did a spell on Tuesday and another one tomorrow (Friday).

First spell (Tuesday - Venus Hour)

Materials:

• 2 taper candles (red, pink + auxiliary white candle) (btw i usually break my candles into two so it doesn't take too much time to burn)

• Red thread

• Sugar, cinnamon (i used powdered), rose petals, jasmine, a dandelion, paprika and coffee beans (i used the grinded ones that you use in a coffee maker)

• Paper, fireproof plate/container, red pen, something pointed to carve in the candles

• Optional: Crystals and tarot cards, i used The Lovers, The Empress, 2 of Cups, 10 of cups and The Sun

Steps:

In the paper write the person's name and birth date, and circle it writing ""Love Me"", fold it three times towards you and set it aside (You can see this part a lot on tiktok as a full spell)

Carve in the red candle their name, in the pink your name and with your finger add cinnamon to both names.

Make the names face each other and with the auxiliary candle join both candles. Then, wrap them with the red thread (I wrap the thread around it about 15 to 20 times). Set them aside.

In your plate, make a circle with the sugar, add the rose petals (i put 8 like if it was an analogical clock), add the jasmine, add the dandelion petals? idk the name but that white thing at the top. Now add your cinnamon and paprika, but just a little; for the last step make a circle with the coffee right outside of your sugar circle, like an outline.

Now put your candle in the middle, glue it with the auxiliary candle, bc if you burn the bottom of the candle, you can also burn the thread. If you have leftover rose petals, add them in a circle around the candle.

Light your candle, burn the paper we did before and add its ashes to your sugar circle. Now intention it and let it burn.

When the candles have burned down completely (still hot), mix with all the stuff you have put in your circle, i left those rest in a paper bag i had, just make sure you don't lose them.

Second spell (Friday - Venus Hour)

So for this spell i want to intensify my dominance towards the other person, so I'm going to use a sigil i made, but you can change the steps to match your intention.

Materials:

• same candles as before

• the rest of the spell that we saved

• Jasmine, paprika, rose petals, rusted (or not) nails, cinnamon,  rose thorns, sugar.

• Fireproof plate, paper and red pen, red thread and the pointy thing to carve the candles.

• Optional: a tiny jar to put your spell, you can also dispose it to nature but i want to keep it.

In the paper, draw your sigil or something that simbolizes your intention.

You're gonna do the exact same thing we did before with the candles, but now you're going to add paprika to their name.

Make your sugar circle and add the rose petals, jasmine, cinnamon and paprika, but now we're going to put the nails with the pointy part outwards, same with the thorns. This is going to simbolize kind of protection towards people who want to hurt the relationship in any way.

Place your candle in the middle, burn the paper from before, put the ashes around and light the candles, then burn completely. Put the rests on the jar and seal with wax or you can put your auxiliary candle there and let it burn to seal it.

1r2wtjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1r2wtjg/this_karen_at_my_work/,This Karen at my work...,"So there's this bword at my work that I freaking can't with.

(Sorry if I have the wrong flair. This is both a vent and somewhat a personal story I guess?)

I'll keep it simple. Rude, butts in conversations and then tries to abide to rules that don't matter. Need to get some grudges off my chest...

There was a time the Karen ruined my first impression/interaction with someone on the workfloor whom I haven't met yet (I struggle with socializing), by trying to play the hero, saying I'm bothering person A while I just wanted to learn to interact with people.

ALL I wanted to ask was if Person A was stationed on my workspot on a day I wasn't scheduled in. Why? I'm allergic to dog hairs so if she WAS, I could issue this to my supervisor and have her sit on a different spot for my health. That's it. Karen was going like ""she neeeds the dog, she has something!"" I KNOW THAT, YOU DUMB KAREN. KINDLY MIND YOUR BUSINESS. I'm not bothered by her HAVING the dog she MEDICALLY NEEDS. Sheesh.

So now it was a back and forth of me trying to tell karen POLITELY to not butt in, but then Person A talked, thinking I'm bothered by the dog but I can't handle 2+ convos at the same time. It overstimulated me (I'm Autistic + ADHD) so I just dropped the convo all sour at this make-up face karen.

Another time Karen refused to take my order just because I was 3 minutes too early for lunchbreak and let a visitor go first. Meanwhile some other co-workers of mine just serve me just fine and have no issue with me coming early to avoid the lines. I'm not the only one who does this after all.

Note: Visitors have the right to go first if they want to buy something, EXCEPT when an employee in front of them wants to buy something too, like a small sandwich or soda can during their breaktime. Karen ignored that rule.

Then there was a day that I was waiting in line for café staff to fill my ramen (I eat ramen at work with a latte glass bc that's the only one where it fits in and to save on time. I'm pretty much the local ramen girl there lmao, don't judge me) and it takes a little while to receive my glass, crush the ramen while still inside the pack, pour it in the glass, then open and pour those flavor and oil sachets they always include and THEN get my food. Since it takes some time, I often let people pass me in line if they want to buy a sandwich or drink, so don't have to wait too long on me. Also the second reason why I come early before the break starts.

So one time SHE CUT ME IN LINE with the excuse of ""I just want to get my tea.""

I am a very patient person but she makes me want to punch her so bad. Or at least yell at her, but that could ruin my image and reputation.

So you know what I did? The moment one of the cafe workers put down a cup (they always put cups of coffee and tea on the bar for employees to grab right as the break starts), I cut HER in line, took the tea and just turned to her with a smug face walking off like a bad bitch.

Nowadays when I see her at the cafe, I ignore her ass and ask for someone else to fill up my glass with tea or ramen.

I’m fairly sensitive to high doses of caffeine so I don’t typically drink coffee, but I do drink green tea almost everyday so I do consume a lower dose of caffeine.  I was tired before a wedding and that was the only option I could find near the wedding venue.  I had a really bad reaction to the latte.  I was swaying when standing up and dizzy when I was walking.  I thought I was going to fall at some point.  I did feel dehydrated so I drank some water and continued to have a few drinks at the wedding which made me feel better temporarily.  Over the past 2 months I’ve been dealing with this sensation while walking on and off.  I thought it was related to the latte and me binge drinking at the wedding.  My doctor said it could be a result of alcohol withdrawal due to binge drinking and/or anxiety/hangxiety.  I haven’t had an alcoholic drink since the wedding and I cut out any type of caffeine shortly after because it would make my symptoms worst.  The only anxiety I experience is due to this feeling I’m experiencing.  I did stop my cholesterol medicine, which did make me feel better overall, but didn’t completely solve my dizziness.  On some nights I also do experience some insomnia as well.  I do notice that I do feel it more when I’m out of the house around people.

Hello lovely IMAM folks! I have been planning and working on a longer review series of my entire collection, and that is still in the works, but I wanted to quickly throw down a post today because I have received my most recent Pineward order and it's great and I have thoughts! I have at this point almost their entire catalog (🙈) but I'm just gonna go through the ones in this order. I got what I think must be a new prototype and it's dope. 

Context/ my vibes: I like masc-to-neutral scents on the weirder end of the spectrum.   
  
I like woods, incenses, smoke, leather, realistic aquatics, hay, vanilla, tea & coffee, spices, fabric notes, and lactonics. 

I tend not to like heady florals, sugary-sweet notes, aldehydes, soapy greens, fruit notes, rose, iris, and anything heavily powdery.

Review time!

Generally speaking, all of Pineward's stuff has great longevity on me. They're all EDPS and last anywhere from 6–8 hours and often into the next day on fabric. Strong projection, but not so strong that it gives my sensitive spouse a headache.

\_\_\_\_

**Ponderosa** (Ponderosa resin, ponderosa needles, cedar, vanilla, strawberry, cinnamon, butterscotch, beeswax\*, raisin cookies). 

You are on a hike in a high, warm pine wood on a summer day in Texas. Your coolest friend made cookies yesterday and you've taken some with you as hike fuel. You sit on a sun-warmed rock and dig one out and eat it while breathing in the air. You contemplate taking a bite of one of the trees around you, but you don't, because you're a normal person. From the notes this seems like it could go straight gourmand but it is very much a golden-sap forward tree smell.

She is everything to me. She is the scent that changed my mind about strawberry and butterscotch. She goes against everything I thought I would like but I love her so much that in this order I got a 17mL. She is one of two perfumes that have made my friends go ""you smell GOOD"" upon hugging me.

Rating: no cookie I ever make will ever smell as good as this and I have to be okay with that. 

\_\_\_\_

**Cotswold** (cedar, smoke, oakwood, ponderosa pine needles, black spruce, vanilla, hops). 

Given the presence of ponderosa needles I basically knew I would love this and I was correct. This goes on a little like Gristmill with its strong wood opening, but settles more warmly. As a woodstove owner who spends a lot of his time smelling like smoke, this smoke note is very firmly a woodsmoke note, not barbecuey but deep and warm, like you're sitting by a stove in a tiny cabin at the end of a long day, warming up your cold cold toes. This is the kind of warm smell that I can only describe as ""warm in the way that actively keeps back the cold."" There's cold air just outside but because you built a good fire it can't get you.

I honestly should have just blind-bought a dram instead of a sample because I knew I would feel this way. I smell like the hottest, most gender version of myself. This guy chops your wood for you without expecting any thanks because he's just a nice dude.

Rating: this scent is why winter is my favorite season, I want to be him

\_\_\_

**Murkwood** (fir balsam, black hemlock, lapsang souchong, moss, incense, bitter myrrh).

Forest + incense?? Sign me up. It goes on me as a straight-up-and-down forest scent, conifer-forward in a dark and velvety sort of way. This isn't a wet wood, but it is a deep one with a lot of winding paths, and it only dislikes you a little bit. This forest & you have a complex relationship neither of you have defined. A lot of conifer notes go candle-y on me, but true to Pineward's reputation Murkwood stays firmly in ""you are actually in the woods and have maybe rubbed yourself on a tree"" territory, which is really nice. This is described as a dark smell, but I think the underpinning of incense and myrrh really gives it a lasting comfortable lightness. 

This ALSO stays away from the other place that a few of Pineward's woodsy scents go on me, which is cologney. I want to smell like I am a forest creature, not like I am trying to smell like a forest creature, and this accomplishes that.

Rating: need to get lost and become one with these woods specifically

\_\_\_

**Hot Springs in Winter** (an unreleased prototype I think, so no given notes, but I get a mineralic water kind of smell, something definitely woody and wet, and salt? I think?)

Legitimately, this smells like a hot spring in winter. Specifically when it goes on, it smells warm and wet, again in that way that suggests the cold is lurking nearby but not on you, because you're chilling in a hot spring while it snows like a cool macaque. The steam dissipates as it dries, leaving my skin smelling eerily like I have just been soaking in a mineral-filled spring but have since dried off and am now wearing a fluffy white robe while I drink tea and watch the snow fall from my room. There is no sweetness at all to this scent. I wouldn't even call it fresh—it's just clean without being soapy. I wish there was a bit of roundness, maybe wood or incense, to add a tiny bit more depth (hinoki or cedar would be so good, if they aren't already lurking in there).

I went on such a quest to find out if this was a prototype or not because, I am not kidding in the slightest, literally the day before this arrived I was telling my spouse that my ideal scent as a winter and snow lover would be the smell of being in a hot spring while it snowed. Then this unexpectedly was part of my package and I was very slightly shook. How did you know, Pineward??? Is it because you have my exact scent preferences on a little list somewhere and you're just making Smells Julian Wants?? Please keep doing that and also how.

Rating: you're the coolest and fluffiest macaque in the hot spring, I need this to become real some day

\_\_\_

If these essays were too long (sorry sorry I'm a writer sorry) the upshot is that Pineward has my number and I'm well on my way to owning some version of everything they've ever made and I love them, and also what I think is the new prototype is sooooooo nice.

In the past weeks I had a lot of problems with my medication, I lost focus, had really bad sleep and seemingly random mental breakdowns resulting in crying and panic attacks. From the first signs I already tought about this is caused more by psychological than medication problems, so I requested an appointment at my psychologist, but before that I also consulted with my psychiatrist. She raised my dose from 50 mg to 70 mg.

I’ve been currently taking 70 mg for one and a half week now. In the first days my heart rate was pretty high but I was used to it, I experienced it on my first days and when I took 50 mg for the first time after 30. The first wierd experience was that I became so tired in the afternoon, that I could barely keep my eyes opened.

As days passed I started to experience heavy breathing, I was not choking or anything but I constantly felt that I couldn’t breathe deep enough.

With my psychologist I identified that this is caused by my mental state and since then I can manage any changes in mood and get good sleep. All in all I feel much better and Livizux is working again.

However two symptoms are still occurring every day. Around 11 am each day I become really exhausted and heavy breathing comes too. I can manage tiredness with some coffee but it is not ideal together with stimulants and also makes the heavy breathing stronger for a few hours. Without coffee I loose my focus and drive, not because the meds aren’t working but because I become so tired that I barely have energy to stand up.

I still have like 10 pills left from my 50 mg (and 30 mg too) and I was thinking about taking that tomorrow instead of 70 mg and see what happens.

INFJ 5w4 (549 tritype) with sx/sp instincts here. In Socionics, I lean EII. I’m usually just chill, but I also hit these massive waves of emotional intensity that I have to constantly calibrate.

Most of my energy goes there… making sure that I can function as a human, not a golden retriever or a black cat. But it’s exhausting.

The ""Mushroom"" Lifestyle

My default state is total isolation. I can go months without going out or engaging with anyone, barely talking to my family or seeing my best friend even though we live in the same city. But when I finally ""pop up"" and go out, I’m suddenly the life of the party. I’ve literally had a dance battle with a stranger in a club before. That was two years ago, and I only went because it was a send-off party for a college friend.

The Sacred Space (sx/sp)

My sx/sp instincts are tied at 70%, so I don't do ""casual."" I treat my close connections as sacred spaces. When a third party tampers with that space, it feels like a total betrayal of the bond. I'm either 100% committed or 0% there.

The Data & Mistypes

Recently, I took the Sakinorva test. My results kinda confused me, but they also kinda make sense? I get mistyped as ENFP, ENTP, or INTJ depending on the time of day… or whether I’ve eaten and had my coffee.

 \* Ni (36) Ne (30.6) / Fe (30) / Fi (29): My Ni is the clear lead, but my Fe and Fi are almost equal, which creates some very rigid internal boundaries.

I have that life of the party energy when I’m actually engaged, but I have the hermit battery of a 5w4.

Alone but not lonely, though I'm also quietly hopeful of finding someone who will resonate and connect on a deeper level. Either way, I’m good if I don't.

Because when that’s the way you pay for things, this simply isn’t an issue. 

Quite surprisingly, I started getting downvoted and got some negative comments as if there’s something wrong with paying cash. 

Just for context, I do understand the advantages of digital payments (which are mostly in favour of businesses/merchants).

However, for myself and my situation it makes more sense to pay with cash. I can budget more easily, I’m less tempted to spend money I don’t have, and in this day and age when EVERYTHING seems to be a subscription, I’d rather have only 10-15 credit card charges to review every month than 30-40+ charges for $3 coffee purchases or $8 lunches. 

People can pay however they want. But I’m surprised by the level of hostility my comment got. I’m an ex-Torontonian who lived in the city for 29 years until 2022 and I live in Windsor now.

But from what were taught about how the espresso dies after like 30 secs (or loses crema idk) should i still use starbucks espresso? I was gonna use my markout to get it for free but i dont wanna to mess it up and for it to taste bitter... also if its okay to use sbux espresso should i use blonde roast or signature.

They impose emotional labor on the customer to justify the tip, which the customer doesn't want to pay in the first place. This is essentially adding insult to injury. Indeed, I'd rather they just efficiency serve me and I be coerced into tipping on the screen than be forced to have some awkward chat.

If I regularly go to a bakery in Mexico or Europe and the employee is particularly pleasant with me, that feels nice and earnest. In the United States, it's just theater to justify the tip -- even if the customer feels emotionally worse at the end of the exchange. ",113,1770910265.0,EndTipping,74,0.9,False
1r2wha7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r2wha7/rejected_after_a_night_out/,Rejected after a night out?,"I’ve been really close with this one coworker (who came for a internship from another country) and we hit it off immediately. There was so much tension between us during this year and we got very close.

We’d set meetings up for “work”, but just end up having deep conversations about our lives. This turned to us always messaging each other on teams and just staying in contact. She’d wait for me each morning to get coffee, tell me abt the stuff she was doing. Honestly it felt like she was my girlfriend. Only thing was that I was in a relationship so I never tried to pursue anything more than just coworkers/close friends. She clearly gave me STRONG signals that she was interested like for example she asked me if I would drop her home on her last day 3 months before her actual last day. Even people in the office picked up on our vibe. 

Her last day came around and it was just us in the office (we all work from home on fridays) and literally it was the busiest day for me (not normal). On top of that, random coworkers would pop by and it felt like people were just keeping an eye on us. Anyways we had a plan to go out to the club to celebrate her last day. I ended up dropping her home after work and i kinda tried to make a move to come inside, but she said “this isnt our goodbye yet, im seeing you later”. Which made sense bc we didnt have much time to get ready anyways.

Then at the club it was just like how it always was, kept glancing at me, hovering around me, always jumping into convo’s with me, but I felt a bit restrained bc there were other coworkers with us. At the end of the night, she came up to me and asked me to take her home. Her words were “I need to go home, can you bring me home” and I said “want to go right now? Lets go, ill take you” Then I said something like “do you trust me taking you back” in  a flirty way and she said “yes ofc” then she said “ok lets leave in like 5 10 minutes” so i said “sure, grab me when you’re ready”.

The time passes and she ends up coming up to me , but instead she gives me her “goodbye” and it literally felt like a fucking movie scene. In a club with dark lights, that one moment we basically got a spotlight on us and she comes up and says “im going to leave now” “you were the BEST person I met here in the US and I am really going to miss you” and I said a few things and we hugged 3 times in front of everyone and the last hug i told her “you promise me you’ll find your way back here?” And she said “yes of course” and we did a lil pinky promise (corny I know right?). What killed me was that she was leaving with a guy she was previously seeing (from work and she told me that she stopped seeing him couple weeks before this moment). He was also weird around me after they split, like he randomly messaged me trying to get close and followed me on my socials. So when i saw them leave together, in my mind i was like “wtf happened?” She asked me to take her home, yet she gives me a goodbye and hugs me and says im the best person she met and she seemed very emotional, but leaving with that guy??

So anyways she walks out and Im pretty confused at this point and I really only came just for her bc we were really close and there was just so much tension that I wanted our private goodbye. And as soon as I get outside, I get a message from her saying “hey, im in the bus now” then she said “are you still there? I think i left my wallet, can u ask my friend if he has it?” I tell her that i already left. Then i asked if that guy was with her on the bus. She says “no he took his own bus going home, im by myself”. And now im really fucking confused and i ask her “why didnt you wait for me?” She said “idk” and changed the topic about some guy liking her story. So i assumed maybe she just rejected me or whatevr.

The next day she was messaging me like crazy and was very emotional. I gave her a bracelet (which she wore to the club and showed me) and a card. She said she read the card and was very emotional. She said things like “you made my time here very special” “you better visit me in my country” “you have a special place in my heart” “my routine is going to be boring with you in it” “i miss you already” “Ill be waiting for you in my country”. 

So like what gives? Why didnt she let me take her home? Its as if she didnt want our “story” to end with me taking her home that night. Now shes back in her country and she has been messaging and told me she wants weekly calls, etc. im just so confused bc she meant so much to me and I just wanted to have our own private moment to let our feelings out and now shes gone and I am really feeling the loss.",1,1770910264.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Some places have flavored creamer like Coffee Mate, Hazelnut, and French Vanilla, and some places have low or fat-free or skim milk, even powder creamers. Of course there's the non-dairy alternatives, oat, soy, almond and the like. Yet no place I've found anymore really carries whole milk or heavy cream.  I'm wondering why.  I've tried it at home and it's not like I can tell a big difference in taste or function, I can't imagine they keep better than milk or Heavy (actually that's a lie, I think heavy can go bad rather quickly especially outside of the fridge.) so what's with half and half as the ubiquitous creamer? Wouldn't you want more fat in a creamer, especially for how little you actually need in coffee or tea? Or do people drink much more tea and coffee(or at least use much more creamer) than I realized that they are concerned about how much fat content there is? If you're concerned about fat why not just opt for whole milk?",1,1770910180.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,1.0,False

This is my second Vibe Coding service, and I'd like to share how I built it and made it profitable!

First of all, I have about 10 years of experience in interface design and development in the industrial automation field, so I have some development experience. My major is design.

This service allows you to simultaneously receive answers from three LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude) for a single question. I wanted to cross-check the information for more accurate results, so I created it as a Chrome plugin for my personal use.

I used to subscribe to GPT, but with the introduction of generative AI, I switched to Gemini. However, I sometimes missed GPT's answers, so I wondered, ""Isn't there a tool that allows me to use them simultaneously?""

This service works by allowing you to type messages into the main chat window using your account. It translates the conversation into English and displays the conclusion in the first sentence, allowing for quick comparison. The split-window feature also allows you to add custom slots and add other sites to your custom chat.

The business model is to provide basic features permanently for free and generate revenue by charging for features like ""sponsors,"" ""the ability to expand windows to four,"" and ""adding custom slots.""

We used AntiGravity for development and LemonSqueegy for the payment system. While developing the MVP took about three days, adding features, improving the service, stabilizing it, and monetizing ""sponsors"" took about 17 days. I'm still using the service, adding new features, and fixing bugs.

While I only earned $3.50 from ""coffee sponsorships,"" it was a quick success story, so I'm sharing it. I'll continue to use Vibe Coding to quickly develop and monetize the services I use. Thank you for reading!

My first income!

Tech support isn’t predictable. One minute, a field tech is wrapping up at a client site, the next they’re racing to a critical outage, juggling truck rolls across town, or patching an urgent issue between stops. 😰  
   
Traditional service desks that tether you to a laptop just don’t cut it when work happens wherever the tech is.  
   
With DeskDay's mobile Service Desk for MSPs and IT teams, your team can create, update, assign, and close tickets from anywhere, whether it’s on a job site, in transit, or between back-to-back appointments. ⚡  
   
From push notifications the second a ticket lands, to real-time access to chats and history, the entire ticket lifecycle fits in a pocket. 💜  
   
And it’s not just nice to have. Mobile flexibility is now a baseline expectation. Nearly all adults use smartphones daily, and modern workflows are built around mobility, not desks. 😊

1r2vyrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFLOrthodontist/comments/1r2vyrq/best_orthodontist_for_braces_and_invisalign_near/,"Best Orthodontist for Braces and Invisalign Near Broward County: Complete Guide to Costs, Options, and Treatment Plans","# Honest Guide: Metal vs. Ceramic vs. Invisalign (Read this before spending $5,000)

I’ve talked to hundreds of people in South Florida (Broward/Miami-Dade area) who picked the wrong option because they didn't understand the trade-offs.

They wanted the ""invisible"" option but their teeth needed a tank.
They went cheap and regretted it six months later.
They picked ""fast"" without realizing it meant pain.

The real question isn't ""what is best?"" It's **""what is best for your specific life/budget?""**

Here is the no-fluff breakdown so you don’t burn cash on a treatment that doesn't work for you.

***

## 1. Metal Braces: The ""Tank"" Option
**Status:** The Gold Standard.
**Cost:** $3,000 - $7,000 (Usually the cheapest).

Metal braces have been around forever for a reason: **They work.**

*   **The Pro:** Speed. Most cases finish in 18-24 months. If you have a complex bite (crazy crowding, jaw issues), this is usually the only real fix.
*   **The Con:** Vanity. Everyone sees them.
*   **The Truth:** Most adults get over the ""metal mouth"" look in two weeks. You care way more about straight teeth at the finish line than looking cool in the middle.

## 2. Ceramic Braces: The Content Creator Special
**Status:** Looks better, costs more, hurts the same.
**Cost:** $4,000 - $8,000.

Basically metal braces, but the brackets are tooth-colored.

*   **The Pro:** Distance stealth. From 5 feet away, people might not notice.
*   **The Con:** Durability. Ceramic creates friction and breaks easier than metal. Also, if you drink coffee/wine, the bands *will* stain.
*   **The Verdict:** Good for people who need the power of braces but work in front of clients/cameras.

## 3. Self-Ligating Braces: The Tech Upgrade
**Status:** Premium mechanics.
**Cost:** $5,000 - $9,000.

These use a clip instead of elastic bands to hold the wire.

*   **The Pro:** Easier to clean (no rubber bands to trap food). Potentially fewer appointments.
*   **The Con:** Expensive.
*   **The Verdict:** Sometimes worth it for comfort/hygiene, but ask a Board Certified Ortho if it actually speeds up *your* specific case.

## 4. Clear Aligners (Invisalign): The ""Discipline Test""
**Status:** High Risk, High Reward.
**Cost:** $4,000 - $8,500.

This is what everyone *wants*, but not everyone *should get*.

*   **The Pro:** Invisible. You can take them out to eat (huge plus). No food stuck in wires.
*   **The Con:** **You have to wear them 22 hours a day.**
*   **The Truth:** If you take them out for a ""quick snack"" and forget to put them back in for 4 hours, your teeth stop moving. In fact, they can shift back.
*   **The Catch:** Not great for severe bite issues.

***

## The ""Hidden"" Costs & Insurance

Don't just look at the sticker price. Look at the **Time Cost.**

A $3,000 treatment that takes 3 years costs you more in life/time than a $5,000 treatment that finishes in 18 months.

**Insurance:**
*   Usually covers 50-80% (up to a max of ~$2k).
*   ALWAYS check if there is an age limit or a ""waiting period.""
*   Payment plans are standard. You shouldn't be writing a $5k check on day one. Expect $200-$300/month.

## Which one is for you?

*   **Care about Speed?** -> Metal Braces.
*   **Care about Invisibility?** -> Aligners (If you have discipline).
*   **Care about ""Sorta Invisible"" but have bad teeth?** -> Ceramic.
*   **Lifestyle:** If you are a grazer who eats small meals all day, Aligners will be a nightmare. If you play contact sports, metal brackets cut up your lips without a good mouthguard.

turning 26 soon, wfh and bihira lumabas unless it’s for household errands. im an extrovert, pero medyo mabilis madrain social battery kasi di na sanay lumabas labas.

i value my alone time a lot. i’m very independent, and hindi ako clingy. TBH i don’t want someone clingy either. pero not clingy ≠ not interested.  i just don’t believe in constant monitoring. go out with your friends, enjoy, minimal updates here and there siguro, tapos kwento mo na lang pag-uwi mo. i respect space and expect the same.

i’m the eldest child, so i grew up responsible, protective, and nurturing by default. my authenticity is non-negotiable, i won’t change who i am for someone, and i don’t expect anyone to change for me either. i grew up receiving so much love and respect from my family, so i don’t tolerate BS. if i feel disrespected or my peace gets disrupted, i leave.

personality-wise: i like banter (funny, not offensive). shy at first but i open up when comfy. nasabihan na akong hindi sweet, medyo masungit/maldita, and very frank 😅 but i am funny daw! i also wear my emotions on my sleeve, so super halata talaga when i don’t like something. mabilis ako tumawa though, so di naman ako nagdu-dwell much.

when i do go out, i’ve been told i’m great company and not KJ. g ako sa kahit ano, esp extreme rides! i read books, love science, and i LOVE games. board games, online games, whatever! very competitive ako, also super family-oriented and a breadwinner in a very loving home. i love coffee! i drink occasionally… actually favorite ko to drink ay red horse 😭

physically: wavy hair, pretty eyes (i think), around 160–163 cm in height. may RBF, pero i think dahil lang sa mata ko. not very active right now and currently dealing with a hormonal condition, so i gained a bit of weight (\~70 kg) but i’m working on it. if that’s an issue, i’m not for you. i have a tattoo sa shoulder ko

i live sa province but go to mnl from time to time. medyo 2-3 hours lang yung commute :)

i have two amazing and cute cats who i love SOOOO much, they’re the loves of my life. if they could talk siguro they’d say, “clingy ang mom physically bc she likes to squish us with hugs on an hourly basis” !! takot ako sa dogs 😅

my giving love language is acts of service. receiving love language ko is words of affirmation. i tend to appreciate small keepsakes more than big gifts. handwritten letters >>>

usually i go for tall guys na may matangos na ilong :) hopefully hindi bulky/super ma-muscle! and sana smart ka, kasi i like learning new things. age-wise, preferably around my age, siguro 24-32 is okay for me.

i take things slow. no meeting within the first month. i believe na trust has to be earned on both sides :)

non-negotiables:

\* not DDS/BBM

\* doesn’t smoke

\* not an incel

\* not an alpha male wannabe

\* no toxic masculinity

\* has work (just a preference. has nothing to do with providing. i’ll do 50/50 on our dates)

1r2vud5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r2vud5/th_the_man_in_the_file_6136/,[TH] The Man in the File #6136,"**Belief.**

Kabir believed in systems.

Not because they were just, but because they existed. In a country where everything leaked Time, law, memory, systems were the only things that pretended to hold. Systems kept things in order. Forms. Logs. Approvals. In other words, systems enforced order and reduced threats.

He worked for Internal Security, a department no one admitted existed. His badge carried no name, only a number that changed every year. This year: #6136. His job was simple: verify threats before they became public. Rumours. Patterns. Whispers. Deviations. Most importantly, men who believed too strongly in causes tended to attract attention.

Kabir was assigned to observe them.

From the shadows, he watched.

One by one. Slowly by slowly.

Assess. Record. Submit.

He lived alone. No photographs. Little furniture. No mirrors except the one in the bathroom, which he avoided. He exercised every morning with ritualistic severity, as if the body itself might betray him if left ungoverned. Then a cold shower, followed by black coffee. He spoke rarely, and when he did, people listened, not because he was loud, nor because he liked to be the center of attention, but because he sounded certain.

Certainty was his weapon.

\*

October 30, 2025  
Time: 3:15 P.M.

A file landed on his desk without explanation. Just there, waiting to be opened, a bold black title staring at him.

**SUBJECT: KABIR**

He assumed it was a clerical error. It happened. Names repeated. Lives overlapped with one another. Still, protocol required review. Kabir grabbed his red notebook and began reviewing the file.

The file was thin. Too thin.

It contained surveillance photos. A man with a trimmed beard and baseball hat leaving an apartment at dawn. A man walking the same routes every night. A man standing still at traffic signals long after the light had turned green.

The man was unmistakably him.

Kabir felt no panic. Panic implied disorder. This was something else, an administrative mistake perhaps. It happened from time to time. He followed the procedure, requesting clarification. He submitted Form 58-B through the internal portal. He went to see the manager to learn more about the case file, to gain any insight. After all, she knew him. She smiled, noncommittal, playing too dumb to know anything. That was it. No information from the manager. She told him to wait until the status of his Form 58-B comes back.

Kabir left with a silent smile that mirrored hers.

Next week, the result came.

**Status: REJECTED – insufficient authorization tier.**

Over the next weeks, restrictions appeared. His access codes failed intermittently. Colleagues spoke to him with the cautious politeness reserved for men already under suspicion. A memo circulated reminding staff that no operative was exempt from oversight.

At night, he dreamed of corridors without doors. He began following himself. Not literally; nothing so crude, but through the city’s paper trail. Utility records, transit logs, CCTV footage, phone records, internet logs. Everywhere he looked, evidence of his movements appeared before he remembered making them. As if his life were being lived a few seconds ahead of him, pre-recorded, predetermined.

And the file updated daily.

BEHAVIORAL NOTES: Subject exhibits excessive trust in institutional logic.  
RISK ASSESSMENT: High. Subject believes he is necessary.

Kabir stopped sleeping. Thoughts after thoughts after thoughts blurred his reality and peace.

He went to headquarters one morning to confront his manager, only to find the office reassigned. He missed a day of exercise. The nameplate removed. The desk empty. No one recalled the man ever working there.

“Departments restructure,” an administrative assistant said without looking up. “You should know that.” Her tone was dismissive.

“I need to know who authorized this file,” Kabir said.

The administrative assistant finally met his eyes. “Sir, this file authorizes you.” Then she said gently, “You see…consistency draws review.”

\*

He didn’t say anything after that. He grabbed his things. The bus was late again. He stood between two construction workers arguing about cricket scores, the smell of diesel trapped in the heat. When he arrived home, he made some coffee. It didn’t taste right. Too bitter. Too different.

EXECUTION CLEARANCE GRANTED.  
TARGET: KABIR.  
METHOD: Discretionary.

No signature. None was required.

For the first time in his life, Kabir considered refusal. But refusal itself was a form of belief, a belief that one stood outside the system. He had never believed that.

He cleaned his weapon meticulously. He dressed as he would for any operation. He moved through the city with the calm precision that had once made him indispensable.

At dawn, he stood in his apartment, weapon raised, staring into the bathroom mirror.

The man staring back looked relieved.

In that moment, Kabir understood the final function of the system. It did not punish disobedience. It eliminated certainty. Men who believed too strongly became unstable variables.

As the shot rang out, somewhere deep within the bureaucracy, a file closed itself.

The following morning, a new operative woke early, exercised in silence, and reported to a department no one officially acknowledged.

On his desk lay a thin folder.

SUBJECT: ———

The name would be assigned later.

Names, after all, were replaceable.

What mattered was belief.

And belief,  
once recorded,  
could be corrected.

The End

1r2vmtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1r2vmtn/did_i_get_rejected_or/,Did I get rejected or?,"I’ve been really close with this one coworker (who came for a internship from another country) and we hit it off immediately. There was so much tension between us during this year and we got very close.

We’d set meetings up for “work”, but just end up having deep conversations about our lives. This turned to us always messaging each other on teams and just staying in contact. She’d wait for me each morning to get coffee, tell me abt the stuff she was doing. Honestly it felt like she was my girlfriend. Only thing was that I was in a relationship so I never tried to pursue anything more than just coworkers/close friends. She clearly gave me STRONG signals that she was interested like for example she asked me if I would drop her home on her last day 3 months before her actual last day. Even people in the office picked up on our vibe. 

Her last day came around and it was just us in the office (we all work from home on fridays) and literally it was the busiest day for me (not normal). On top of that, random coworkers would pop by and it felt like people were just keeping an eye on us. Anyways we had a plan to go out to the club to celebrate her last day. I ended up dropping her home after work and i kinda tried to make a move to come inside, but she said “this isnt our goodbye yet, im seeing you later”. Which made sense bc we didnt have much time to get ready anyways.

Then at the club it was just like how it always was, kept glancing at me, hovering around me, always jumping into convo’s with me, but I felt a bit restrained bc there were other coworkers with us. At the end of the night, she came up to me and asked me to take her home. Her words were “I need to go home, can you bring me home” and I said “want to go right now? Lets go, ill take you” Then I said something like “do you trust me taking you back” in  a flirty way and she said “yes ofc” then she said “ok lets leave in like 5 10 minutes” so i said “sure, grab me when you’re ready”.

The time passes and she ends up coming up to me , but instead she gives me her “goodbye” and it literally felt like a fucking movie scene. In a club with dark lights, that one moment we basically got a spotlight on us and she comes up and says “im going to leave now” “you were the BEST person I met here in the US and I am really going to miss you” and I said a few things and we hugged 3 times in front of everyone and the last hug i told her “you promise me you’ll find your way back here?” And she said “yes of course” and we did a lil pinky promise (corny I know right?). What killed me was that she was leaving with a guy she was previously seeing (from work and she told me that she stopped seeing him couple weeks before this moment). He was also weird around me after they split, like he randomly messaged me trying to get close and followed me on my socials. So when i saw them leave together, in my mind i was like “wtf happened?” She asked me to take her home, yet she gives me a goodbye and hugs me and says im the best person she met and she seemed very emotional, but leaving with that guy??

So anyways she walks out and Im pretty confused at this point and I really only came just for her bc we were really close and there was just so much tension that I wanted our private goodbye. And as soon as I get outside, I get a message from her saying “hey, im in the bus now” then she said “are you still there? I think i left my wallet, can u ask my friend if he has it?” I tell her that i already left. Then i asked if that guy was with her on the bus. She says “no he took his own bus going home, im by myself”. And now im really fucking confused and i ask her “why didnt you wait for me?” She said “idk” and changed the topic about some guy liking her story. So i assumed maybe she just rejected me or whatevr.

The next day she was messaging me like crazy and was very emotional. I gave her a bracelet (which she wore to the club and showed me) and a card. She said she read the card and was very emotional. She said things like “you made my time here very special” “you better visit me in my country” “you have a special place in my heart” “my routine is going to be boring with you in it” “i miss you already” “Ill be waiting for you in my country”. 

So like what gives? Why didnt she let me take her home? Its as if she didnt want our “story” to end with me taking her home that night. Now shes back in her country and she has been messaging and told me she wants weekly calls, etc. im just so confused bc she meant so much to me and I just wanted to have our own private moment to let our feelings out and now shes gone and I am really feeling the loss.",1,1770908368.0,bodylanguage,6,1.0,False

One time a co-worker who knows I hike nude regularly and wondered if he could join me hiking. I told him sure but I hike nude and if he is okay with that he is welcome to come along. Well the day of the hike when we are almost to the trail-head he say he changed his mind about me being nude. I told him you should have decided that before. I am still hiking nude. Anyway after a while I hiked nude and all was well. He did mention a couple of things. 

1.) he felt a little awkward looking at me. He was afraid if he looked in my direction I would think he was staring a my genitals. I told him don't worry he can look it's no big deal everyone is curious.

2.)He would feel awkward if we encountered other hikers. I didn't strip off till I knew there was no other hikers.

Anyway quit a while later I asked what his wife thought about me being nude during our hike. He told me he didn't tell her.

Then I have another friend that I am kinda close to. Him and another guy have coffee at least once a week for several years. I have been very open about being a nudist and my regular nude hiking and skinny dipping. He mentioned something about his wife would not like hiking with me because I would be stopping and telling her about every flower and tree along the way. I am a wild flower enthusiast. I have never met his wife but assumed he mentions stuff about me and probably told her I am a nudist. I told him she probably wouldn't like hiking with a nudist either. He said I have never told her.

I find it odd that even though they are not the nude one they even seem hesitant to mention that I am a nudist. Has anyone else noticed this with people in there lives that know. Maybe I am overthinking it and they find it so insignificant that they don't bother mentioning it.",7,1770908357.0,nudism,7,0.69,False

1r2ve3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1r2ve3u/whats_a_good_coffee_grinder_to_buy_right_now/,What’s a good coffee grinder to buy right now?,"Hey everyone! I’m currently looking for a new coffee grinder and I’m a bit overwhelmed by the options out there. I mostly brew pour-over during the week and espresso on weekends, so I need something that can handle both without giving me uneven grind sizes. Consistency is important to me because I’ve noticed how much it affects taste. My current grinder is old and kind of unpredictable. Sometimes the grind is too fine, sometimes too coarse, and it’s getting frustrating. I’ve been browsing online comparing reviews, and I also came across a few options  just to see price differences. But I’m not sure how reliable those would be long term. I’d rather buy something Pricier and good quality once instead of upgrading again in a year. For those who brew both pour-over and espresso, what coffee grinder are you using right now? Manual or electric? Is there a specific model that gives consistent results without being too complicated? Honestly I don’t mind paying for more, if it means I get something good quality.",1,1770907817.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.67,False
