Finding out you’re pregnant is an incredible moment, and your first prenatal appointment makes it feel even more real. This initial visit kicks off your journey to motherhood and sets the stage for all the prenatal care to come. Let’s break down what you can expect, from what to bring along to the tests and questions you’ll go over with your provider, so you feel prepared and confident when that big day arrives.

**Why Your First Appointment Is Important**

The first prenatal appointment is typically scheduled around 8-10 weeks into your pregnancy. This timing allows your healthcare provider to perform initial screenings, confirm your pregnancy, and discuss any questions or concerns you might have. It’s an important step for both you and your provider to ensure everything is on track for a healthy pregnancy. Many new moms feel a mix of excitement, curiosity, and a bit of nervousness, which is completely normal!

**Preparing for Your Appointment**

Being prepared can make this appointment smoother and help you feel more confident. Here’s a quick checklist:

1. **Medical History**: Your doctor will ask for details about your medical history, including any medications, past surgeries, or chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.
2. **Family History**: Brush up on any family health conditions, such as genetic disorders, diabetes, or pregnancy complications, as these can be important.
3. **Last Menstrual Period**: Your provider will calculate your due date based on this date, so have it handy if possible.
4. **List of Questions**: It’s easy to forget what you want to ask when there’s so much information to take in, so write down questions in advance.
5. **Support Person**: If possible, bring a partner or friend who can help remember information and share in this special experience.

**What to Expect During Your Appointment**

https://preview.redd.it/vpqwhbd61hxd1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd278c2e03ca75543517509e6313eea718417a07

Let’s walk through the key parts of your first prenatal appointment to give you a clearer picture of what will happen.

# 1. Review of Medical and Family History

Your provider will go over your medical history, family health background, lifestyle, and any medications you’re currently taking. This information helps them understand any potential health risks and create a personalized care plan for you and your baby.

# 2. Discussion About Lifestyle and Diet

Expect questions about your diet, exercise routine, and other lifestyle factors, including alcohol or tobacco use. This is also a good time to discuss any adjustments that might help support a healthy pregnancy. Your doctor might suggest a few lifestyle tweaks, like taking prenatal vitamins or avoiding certain foods.

# 3. Blood Tests and Urine Sample

These initial tests cover a variety of health checks:

* **Blood Test**: This will reveal your blood type, Rh factor, and screen for infections such as HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. It also checks for anemia and immunity to certain infections.
* **Urine Test**: The urine sample helps screen for infections and checks protein and glucose levels to watch for signs of preeclampsia or gestational diabetes.

# 4. Physical Exam and Vital Signs

Your provider will record your height and weight to establish a baseline for tracking your pregnancy. They’ll also check your blood pressure and might perform a pelvic exam to assess your reproductive organs. If it’s time for a Pap smear, they might include that as well. This exam helps set a health baseline, so your provider can monitor any changes as your pregnancy progresses.

# 5. Ultrasound (If Applicable)

Depending on your provider and how far along you are, you may have an ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy, check for multiples, and estimate your baby’s gestational age. Not all providers do an ultrasound at the first visit, especially if you’re under 10 weeks, but if you do have one, it’s often a highlight of the appointment. Some parents even get to hear their baby’s heartbeat for the first time, which is a very special moment.

# 6. Estimating Your Due Date

Using the date of your last period and any ultrasound findings, your provider will calculate an estimated due date. Remember, this is just an estimate; many women give birth within a week or two of this date.

# 7. Advice on Prenatal Vitamins, Nutrition, and Exercise

Your provider will likely recommend a prenatal vitamin with folic acid, iron, and other essential nutrients. You’ll also get guidance on foods to include or avoid, safe exercises, and lifestyle modifications to keep you and your baby healthy. They’ll cover key topics like hydration, safe caffeine limits, and the importance of rest.

**Common Questions and Concerns**

https://preview.redd.it/ulbec8891hxd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=218a4c0278c18e9e54a3c4e1dc6c6bdd95672121

Your provider expects questions, so don’t hold back! Here are some common topics that many first-time moms ask about:

* **“Is it normal to feel so tired?”** Yes, fatigue is common in early pregnancy, as your body works hard to support your baby.
* **“What should I do if I’m feeling nauseous?”** Many providers can offer safe remedies and lifestyle tips, or they may prescribe medication if nausea is severe.
* **“Can I drink coffee?”** Most doctors advise limiting caffeine intake to about one small cup a day.
* **“Is it safe to exercise?”** Generally, yes – staying active is beneficial, but your provider can suggest modifications for safety.
* **“Which foods should I avoid?”** Raw or undercooked seafood, high-mercury fish, and unpasteurized dairy products are typically on the “avoid” list, along with deli meats and anything containing raw eggs.

**How Long Does the Appointment Take?**

https://preview.redd.it/e72yiexa1hxd1.png?width=5289&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4603dfeef3b503e8a41f6073c45c98b1b344a75

Expect the first appointment to take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half. With so many topics to cover, it’s normal to feel a bit overwhelmed, so don’t hesitate to ask for clarifications or to take notes during the appointment.

**After the Appointment: What Comes Next?**

Once you’ve completed your first visit, you’ll have a roadmap for your prenatal care. Generally, visits are scheduled every four weeks until the third trimester, when they become more frequent. You’ll leave with a follow-up appointment, any lab orders if needed, and possibly a booklet or packet of information about pregnancy health, nutrition, and what to expect in the coming months.

**Tips for Making the Most of Your First Appointment**

1. **Write Down Key Information**: There’s a lot of information covered, and notes can help you remember everything.
2. **Bring Support**: Having someone with you can help ease nerves and provide an extra set of ears.
3. **Be Honest**: Share your full health history and lifestyle habits. Your provider is there to support you, not judge you.
4. **Ask Questions**: If something’s on your mind, ask! Your peace of mind is important.
5. **Follow Up If Needed**: If you forget to ask something or need reassurance, don’t hesitate to call your provider.

**Final Thoughts**

Your first prenatal appointment is the beginning of a unique journey. It’s a chance to connect with your healthcare team, get answers to your questions, and set a solid foundation for the months ahead. Every pregnancy is different, so focus on what works for you and build a relationship with your provider that feels supportive and informative.

Take a deep breath, trust the process, and remember you’re in good hands. Each appointment builds on the last, and your healthcare team is there to guide you along the way. Here’s to a healthy, happy pregnancy journey!",1,1730110096.0,PregnantandSingle,0,1.0,False

1gdyeol,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1gdyeol/after_two_years_of_trying_i_still_end_up_only/,After two years of trying I still end up only enjoying way less than half of my drinks. I am considering to sell my Flair 58 and grinder. This is on me though!,"Hello, first of all I am sorry for the negative post. This is definitely not an attack on the brand, device or the community, this is very personal and I know it's on my that I don't enjoy my drinks. Basically this post is a final cry for help in tips how to improve, or to conclude that espresso making is just not for me. I also drink V60 with a Kingkrinder K6 and I love that. 

I am considering these three reasons:

1. I just don't like proper espresso, and what I try in cafes (which I do enjoy) is not proper espresso.

2. I am not brewing correctly and I am unable to diagnose the shot.

3. There's something wrong with my gear (I don't suppose so though).

I am thinking this is just option 2. I enjoy espressos at cafes, I enjoy my parents bean to cup machine, hell I even enjoy a bitter nespresso more than what I produce with my Flair. It tastes so bad, like there's something fundamentally wrong with it and I can't diagnose what. I don't taste acidity, or bitterness, I just taste something very bad. Also the coffee looks unpleasant as well, very muddy and dirty.

My grinder is an Eureka Mignon Speciality. At first I figured it must be the alignment, but after carefully aligning a year ago it hasn't improved. I also thought it had to do with cleaning. I use a aeropress filter in between the puck screen and the grounds to prevent the puck screen from getting too dirty and I also clean everything weakly. So that should be fine right? Lastly I use a high flow IMS 18g basket.

Let me post my workflow, I have tried all kinds of roast levels but now we have beans on the lighter end of medium so I'll post my workflow for these particular beans.

18g in, 40-50 g out in around 30-45 seconds. The ranges indicate what I have tried to change to my process. Based on everything I read these ranges should taste at least somewhat good.

Flair 58 on three lights, water straight from the boil in. Puckscreen + aeropress paper heated over the boiler before placing on the coffee. I'm from the Netherlands and water is from the tap. 

I do a preinfuse until 1-2g out at 2 bar, which usually takes around 10-15 seconds. Then I go to 9 bar, then from 25 sec onwards slowly decrease again to 5 bar. Finally I give the cup a stir.

For anyone still reading, thank you for taking the time! Again I don't want to attack anyone, this one is on me, I think it's either just not for me or I suck at diagnosing my shots. Cheers!",1,1730109964.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False

I've been using my Delonghi Decida and a grinder to make espresso for over a year now. In the last few weeks it seems to struggle pulling a shot and we cannot figure out what the issue might be.

It's been quite seemingly dialed in for a while now. A couple weeks ago we started only getting small drips or almost nothing coming out. I spent an hour playing with different grind sizes, eventually maxing out my grinder and but the issues continue to be frequent and shots pulled are almost always way worse than previously. Sometimes it works just ok, but its not close to how it was when we first purchased it.

Things we have considered/done:

* Grind size
* Roast level
* Different coffee brands
* Cleaning my (steel conal) grinder
* Descaling
* Cleaning the portafilter
* Cleaning the grouphead including removing the metal filter
* Checking/cleaning the grouphead gasket

The steam wand works still quite well and we can reliably make frothy milk for cappucinos.

Based on my issues, my uneducated opinion (+ reading the manual) is that the pump is not producing enough pressure, but I do not have a dial built in which could confirm this. How likely could it be that the pump has become defective? Are there other tests which could narrow down the culprit? My next step would be to try and get pre-ground coffee just to confirm the grinder isn't making fine powder or something that I have otherwise overlooked. Is replacing the pump a common issue?",1,1730109869.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1gdydci,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinoybigbrother/comments/1gdydci/so_confirmed_jmfyang_nga/,So confirmed JmFyang nga?,"So guys I think JM is the chosen love team of Fyang and her family. And it's clear din that JM would pick Fyang over Jas. First, when JM left the PBB house, he kept reposting edits of JmFyang. I can't blame him though, his family needs money so he's sticking where the clout is high. He's playing it low-key to avoid haters, but it's obvious kay fyang siya dumidikit and Jm's family din prefers Fyang over Jas kahit dito umamin si Jm. Halata si Jm na pinipili si fyang dahil din si fyang ang first girl na he followed on ig, and then he followed Jas next, Kanachi, and others, lol bat ngayon pa? Guilty yarn?
 
Nung una rin, it seemed like Fyang's management favored Jarren because the JarFyang fandom put in more effort. They even had a coffee truck, a NYC billboard, and more, which must have cost a lot. They were also strong in donations for voting and even gave gifts to Jarren and Fyang's parents, and to the management. Mannix was really pushing for it, he even followed jarren on ig,  reposting Jarfyang edits along with Aling Myrna. There was some tension din that time between Aling Myrna and Aling Ela (JM's mother) regarding the JmFyang fandom (about sa bashing and donations), so Aling Myrna ay biglang yung isang fandom nirerepost.
 
However, Mannix seemed to be turned off by Jarren dahil dinaanan lang daw siya nito noong gabing naglalakad mga housemates, and JM shook hands and greeted him. So para sa kanya mas gusto niya raw marespeto, kasi rerespetuhin din daw si fyang pag ganon (But you can see in the video that Jarren also waved) Mukhang sobrang taas ng tingin sa sarili ni mannix lol.  If JmFyang man talaga, edi go.  It's also clear that Fyang likes JM, just by her actions towards jm, mukhang kilig siya talaga rito.
 
Our jarren is almost perfect. He's got the looks, charisma, height, and he's TALENTED, especially in singing. He doesn't need a love team to become famous, so 'di po siya kawalan. He can shine on his own. So it would be better if Jarren goes solo instead of being judged right away by Lolo Mannix, who doesn't really know him yet.",1,1730109806.0,pinoybigbrother,5,0.6,False

# What is a Niche Market? 9 Promising Niche Markets to Kickstart Your Gold Rush in 2024

# What is a Niche Market?

A niche market is a specialized segment of a larger market, characterized by unique audience needs or market features.

For example, within the women's footwear market, there are niche markets for eco-friendly shoes, orthopedic shoes, and hiking boots. Each niche market aims to meet specific customer needs that are not addressed by the broader market.

Almost every market has its own niche segments. To accurately target a niche market, it is essential to have a detailed understanding of customer needs. Common methods for identifying niche markets include examining the following factors:

* **Price** (high-end, mid-range, discount)
* **Demographics** (gender, age, income level, education)
* **Product Quality** (premium, handmade, affordable)
* **Psychographics** (values, interests, purchasing attitudes)
* **Target Area** (country, city, community)

Choosing to focus on a niche market is a strategic business decision aimed at outperforming competitors targeting broader markets and serving specific customer groups more effectively. Businesses targeting niche markets may delve deeper into even more specialized niches, achieving brand differentiation.

For instance, in the men's activewear market, the running gear segment is a niche market. Companies selling running products can further specialize by offering gear specifically for marathon runners, thus catering to customers who need specialized running equipment that general running stores may not provide.

# 9 Examples of Niche Markets

Of course, you can build a business focused on selling best-selling products. However, another secret to e-commerce success is targeting a niche market and digging deep into niche products that align well with that market.

For many new businesses, the following nine niche market opportunities are worth exploring:

1. **Conscious Consumers**
2. **Health and Wellness**
3. **Pet Owners**
4. **Outdoor Enthusiasts**
5. **Travelers**
6. **Gamers**
7. **Homeowners and Renters**
8. **Remote Workers**
9. **Local Niche Markets**

# 1. Conscious Consumers

Conscious consumers are increasingly focused on sustainability. Annual surveys show that most conscious consumers are willing to change their shopping habits to reduce their environmental impact. For some, this means purchasing high-quality products that last longer, while for others, it means adjusting their habits to buy more second-hand and resale items.

Other sustainable products include vegan versions, eco-friendly options, or cruelty-free alternatives to traditional goods. If a product is popular in the mainstream market, it may indicate that a segment of conscious consumers is open to its green alternatives.

https://preview.redd.it/pyfhq6viygxd1.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=13b236a639cca1ab447817f162a5ce91b1e5f620

Take Bee's Wrap, for example. This brand offers a range of food wraps made from beeswax, serving as a plastic alternative. Their products are not only eco-friendly but also reusable, making them a cost-effective choice for consumers.

**Niche Product Ideas for Conscious Consumers:**

* Biodegradable phone cases
* Cruelty-free skincare products
* Second-hand or rental clothing
* Eco-friendly kitchenware
* Menstrual cups

**Niche Marketing Ideas for Conscious Consumers:**

* Highlight the environmental benefits of products in packaging and marketing content
* Collaborate with environmental organizations for co-branded campaigns
* Share customer testimonials showcasing how products help them save money or reduce environmental impact
* Regularly update audiences on sustainability efforts via email

# 2. Health and Wellness

Analysts predict that the global health and wellness market will reach $4.5 trillion by 2028. This industry focuses on the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of its audience. Sub-niches include personal care, nutrition, yoga, and alternative therapies. If you've ever purchased gluten-free chocolate cake or organic moisturizer, you've contributed to the health and wellness market.

In recent years, mindfulness apps have become increasingly popular within the health and wellness niche. Meditation app Headspace sees over a million downloads each quarter, while similar app Calm often exceeds $20 million in in-app purchases quarterly.

The success of globally recognized apps indicates that small businesses can also carve out a space for their health-related digital products.

**Niche Product Ideas for Health and Wellness:**

* Plant-based milk alternatives
* Sleep supplements
* DIY healthy snack kits
* Essential oil diffusers
* Kombucha brewing kits

**Niche Marketing Ideas for Health and Wellness:**

* Partner with health experts to enhance brand credibility
* Educate users about the niche through blog posts, videos, or podcasts
* Create health challenges to engage the audience

# 3. Pet Owners

The pet industry not only meets the needs of a broad consumer base but also targets individuals in their prime spending years.

Only Natural Pet is a prime example of a niche business in the pet market. This company specializes in natural pet food, flea treatments, cold-weather gear, and toys. Consumers interested in natural pet products can visit their online store to find everything they need for their furry friends.

While dogs and cats are the most popular pets, reptiles,birds, and small mammals also have their own needs, creating potential niche market opportunities.

This market encompasses a range of activities, each representing a potential niche market.

For example, as birdwatching becomes increasingly popular, high-tech products catering to a new generation of birdwatchers are emerging. Similarly, urban gardening has become a trend in city development, creating demand for space-saving gardening tools and planting devices.

BioLite successfully meets the needs of the outdoor niche market by addressing hikers' and campers' demand for sustainable energy, producing solar-powered lights and camping stoves that convert fire into electricity.

# 5. Travelers

Experiential travel is one of the recent trends in tourism, allowing travelers to enjoy a more active and immersive experience compared to traditional sightseeing or vacationing. The ongoing rise of remote work has also given birth to a new type of traveler: digital nomads, who advance their careers while traveling the globe.

Nomatic is a luggage brand targeting the digital nomad niche market, prioritizing efficiency, functionality, and lightweight packing. Throughout Nomatic's e-commerce site, every product and piece of copy reflects the brand's focus on its audience.

Gamers encompass a wide range of categories, including mobile gamers, PC gamers, console gamers, and tabletop gamers. There are over 3 billion active video game players worldwide, with nearly half willing to spend money on games. The gaming industry is expected to exceed $211 billion in value by 2025.

Within the gaming category, you can target niche markets based on popular game genres, such as first-person shooters, or specific gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Shazim Mohammad founded Glorious Gaming, an online store dedicated to selling products for PC gamers. The store has grown into a seven-figure revenue niche business that operates almost entirely on autopilot.

# 7. Homeowners and Renters

Over the past decade, homeownership rates in the U.S. have struggled to exceed two-thirds of the population, with real estate inflation, limited supply, and rising living costs leading more people to rent.

As the number of renters increases, so does the frequency of moves, resulting in many homes needing renovations and modern upgrades after being vacated. With homeowners renting out properties for passive income, the smart home security niche market has emerged.

For example, August offers keyless entry systems for homeowners. One of its main features allows visitors to enter, enabling homeowners to grant access to renters during specified time frames.

# 8. Remote Workers

The shift from traditional office hours to flexible remote work has transformed the daily routines of many employees. The benefits of hybrid or fully remote work include increased employee satisfaction, with many stating they would seek other employment if they could not work from home.

For businesses, embracing remote work can expand the talent pool, retain more employees, and reduce indirect costs such as rent.

However, remote work also brings new challenges. Most remote workers report that using digital communication tools can lead to feelings of burnout and a decrease in connection with colleagues.

To address these challenges, a range of new niche products has emerged. For example, Miro offers an online collaborative whiteboard platform that helps remote teams brainstorm, plan, and collaborate in real-time, bridging the gap created by physical distance.

Understanding the unique challenges and needs faced by remote workers can inspire innovative product ideas that enhance their work-from-home experience.

# 9. Local Niche Markets

Compared to large retailers, half of consumers prefer local small businesses, prompting even global brands to implement targeted local marketing strategies.

While e-commerce may find it challenging to establish a physical presence locally, e-commerce entrepreneurs can successfully serve their local niche markets through various avenues.

Take the clothing company Peace Collective as an example. Founded in Toronto, it initially aimed to meet the demand for Toronto Blue Jays merchandise during the playoffs. The brand has since partnered with franchises like the NFL, NBA, and MLB, primarily serving other cities by selling team merchandise.

**Niche Product Ideas for Local Markets:**

Entering a competitive market may require you to face strong rivals. Therefore, identifying a niche market can provide a competitive advantage for your e-commerce business from the very beginning. By focusing on specific customer needs and preferences, you can carve out a unique space in the market and build a loyal customer base.

**How to Discover a Niche Market**

Opening a store in a competitive market often means facing off against strong competitors. Therefore, discovering a niche market can provide a competitive advantage for your e-commerce business right from the start.

You don’t necessarily need to sell a wide variety of products; by focusing on a specific niche market, you can stand out from the competition.

While there is no one-size-fits-all method for discovering niche markets and selecting products, there are several common strategies to consider. Here are some initial steps to understand the market landscape and uncover potentially lucrative niche markets.

# Leverage Google Search

To generate excellent niche market ideas, the best approach is to understand what other online retailers are selling or which audiences they are targeting.

When selecting a niche market, utilizing basic Google search functions is a great way to get a sense of the market landscape. For example, searching for ""cruelty-free cosmetics"" can reveal many potential product directions and related topics, such as ""cruelty-free brands"" and ""simple makeup looks.""

In the process of trial and error, you can explore different market trends until you identify unmet needs or audiences within the niche market. Remember, even if there are competitors in your chosen niche, you can still dive deeper into a more segmented niche to enhance your competitiveness. Aim to be a specialist rather than a generalist.

# Use Google Trends to Confirm Long-Term Interest

If you find some interesting results through a simple Google search, the next step is to validate those findings using Google Trends.

By entering your search results into Google Trends, you can see the search interest over time and determine whether the related niche market is consistently favored by the audience, showing growth, or if it’s just a passing trend. This helps you avoid investing in niche markets that may lack long-term potential.

# Create a Mind Map to Brainstorm Business Ideas

Creating a mind map is an effective way to think about different directions for starting a business around a specific niche product. Mind maps reflect the way our brains work, making them an intuitive method for organizing ideas and expanding thoughts.

Mind maps help quickly build product ideas while also exploring different business routes within niche markets. You can use free online tools like Text2MindMap to create mind maps and take full advantage of this simple yet effective visual tool.

# Discover Secondary Niche Markets Using Google’s Search Suggestions

Have you noticed that when you type a query into the Google search bar, it automatically suggests related searches?

These suggestions are the most frequently searched related queries by users, and you can use them to uncover niche markets within related product categories.

Google’s search suggestions related to ""cruelty-free cosmetics.""

Since Google displays a limited number of search suggestions, you can use keyword research tools to see more recommended searches.

This is known as long-tail keyword searching. Long-tail keywords typically consist of a term representing a larger market (like ""cruelty-free cosmetics"") and a term representing a smaller niche market (like ""sensitive skin""), helping to describe the relationship between the niche market and broader product categories.

Entrepreneurs use long-tail keyword data to assess customer interest and analyze the competitive landscape of niche products.

# Conduct In-Depth Keyword Research

You can also use similar tools, such as Google’s Keyword Planner, to discover niche markets. The Google Keyword Planner is a resource available on the Google Ads platform. This tool is similar to the Google suggestions tool mentioned above but provides more advanced and customizable search data.

You’ll need a Google Ads account to use this tool. Log in, select ""Tools"" from the top menu, and then choose ""Keyword Planner.""

Once in the Google Keyword Planner interface, enter your primary niche keyword to view initial search results. You can adjust the location settings to ensure you cover potential target areas. You can also add filters to remove brand keywords and see suggested additional keywords.

Reviewing related keyword search results helps you gain deeper insights into potential niche markets related to your original search term, and sometimes even reveals demand for specific popular products. Don’t hesitate to dig deeper and experiment with various related search terms.

1gdy8ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gdy8ru/25f_exhausted_all_the_time_please_help/,"[25F] Exhausted all the time, please help","25F, 5'1, 105lbs, white, constant fatigue for 1+ year, I take zoloft 100mg for anxiety and hydroxizine 25mg as needed to fall asleep, drink wine a couple times a week, no smoking, no drugs. 

Sorry if this is a little scattered. I really need help. I can't live like this. This issue has been happening for a little over a year but it's gotten worse in the past few weeks. I literally feel like a zombie every moment of the day to the point where sometimes I feel dizzy. When I wake up in the mornings I feel even more tired than when I fell asleep. I get home after work and lay on the floor for 2-3 hours. I don't have a social life because on the weekends all I can do is lay in bed. For the record I'm going to be seeing a PCP about this in two weeks but I'm wondering if anyone can give me ideas of what my issue might be in case I should ask for certain tests to be run. 

About a year ago I began having problems being constantly exhausted. The first red flag for me was I would go to work and be half asleep at my desk, meanwhile my middle-aged coworkers (who had to go home and take care of kids, etc.) were running around all wide awake. I tried to exercise more, focus on sleep hygiene, and sleep 8-10 hours a night, but I still felt tired. 

I also had a pretty rapid onset of general anxiety around this time despite never having anxiety before. I was having a panic attack every day. I figured that I was wasting all my energy worrying about things, which is what was making me tired. I saw a psychiatrist and got put on Zoloft 6 months ago, which slowly ramped up to 100mg. I've been on 100mg for three months now. She also prescribed me hydroxizine because I have trouble falling asleep. 

(I kinda wonder if I might have delayed sleep phase disorder, or whatever it's called, because from 8pm to midnight I'm wide awake, but then exhausted the entire next day. Once I fall asleep though, I feel like my sleep quality is pretty good because I have a lot of intense dreams. I assume this means I get a lot of REM sleep?)

  
In addition to this, I haven't seen a PCP since I was a kid so I feel like I might be deficient in some type of vitamin. Before getting on zoloft I was taking B12, iron, and a multivitamin but I still felt tired on them (I've since stopped taking them, kinda just fell out of habit since they didn't seem to be helping, and my pee was neon yellow from the excess vitamins lol.) Also, I eat extremely healthy however I've been a vegetarian for 13 years so maybe I'm lacking protein? 

When I google 'constant fatique' I can't really find anything that seems to fit the bill. Some other symptoms that I've seen mentioned (that I also have) is very dry skin, and I pee A LOT. For a while I tried to discount this because I drink about 2 cups of coffee a day and 2 water bottles, so maybe I'm just well hydrated? But it's to the point that my coworkers and family notice that I pee a lot, at least every 30 mins. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and even before drinking **anything**, I'll pee 5+ times?? 

  
Sorry again if this is all over the place. Any pointers would be much appreciated. I'm worried that when I tell my new PCP this, she's going to blame it on the zoloft since fatigue can be a side effect. However this issue began before I got on zoloft. In fact I got on zoloft to try to mitigate it when vitamins and sleep hygiene didn't do anything. Zoloft is a life saving medication for me and I really don't want to be told to go off of it.

I recently started drinking pourovers in the morning making a coffeepot for me and the SO with the switch o3. 

I love the simplicity of making a whole pot (450ml) in one go and I think most of the time the coffee is pretty good but I have been using our espresso machine grinder (Braville Barista Pro) and I suspect that it's not ideal.

How noticable are the differences of using a dedicated hand grinder to using the coarsest setting on the Barista? 

Is it worth getting one even if we already have the Barista?

Adding that regarding sourness and bitterness I got it pretty dialed down and worst case I just add some water/saline.

So, there should be less to worry about when it comes to power dynamics. However, we also share a mutual friend group.

Something a mutual friend says to include is that I'm also autistic which is interfering with my ability to comprehend the situation.

I really like this guy romantically. I think he is kind, one of the sweetest people, calming to be around, patient, understanding, funny- just so incredibly witty you have no idea-, charming, charismatic, intelligent, and also really, really handsome. He also somehow manages to put up with my chaotic gremlin nonsense like when I accidentally grew a basil plant instead of cooking it or how I take pens from every swag stand I can or prattle on about trust structures for tax purposes.

One of our friends says it kinda sounds like he also likes me and we may already be dating. I don't know because 1) I don't know what it's like to have many friends, but hanging out 1-on-1 appears to be pretty common and 2) I tend not to trust these things unless explicitly said because I am dense and more than a little stupid. 

The reason one of our friends says he might reciprocate is because we
- go out together for dinner on our own quite frequently
- go to the bookstore or explore downtown or the farmer's market then get coffee together
- if we are in a group, we naturally gravitate towards each other
- we make plans to watch movies as just the two of us
- study together despite us no longer having classes in common (except the impending doom of the bar exam)
- just sit together
- most recently, we got drinks together then he took me home

According to him, these all sound like dates. I don't know because we haven't explicitly said these were dates, and he might just be friendly and enjoy my company. I'm trying to make sure I respect his boundaries and am not overstepping or misreading anything.

I wanna take it to the next step of explicitly asking him on a date, but I'm not sure how to broach it. I want to make sure he knows I value his company outside of a potential romantic relationship, but it is something I would like to pursue. How do I ask him out?

TL;DR I want to ask out the handsome employment law student at my school that I already hangout with a lot outside of our mutual friends, but I am stupid and autistic so I can't read the situation for shit.",0,1730108672.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

His family were amazing people to me. However, they seriously will not leave me alone and have not since we broke up. I still have his family (mom, younger brother & sister) contacts on my phone. They do not know he was into drugs and to the extent it got, all they know is that it was for the best we ended. His mom will regularly text me asking how I am, what I’m doing.

His younger sister always texts me like we are still together. I bumped into his dad a few weeks ago and we had a conversation. The whole time he was convincing me to get back together with his son and how he doesn’t know what he has lost.

Let me break down everything you need to know about moving to Portugal.

No fluff, just real talk.

We're also able to offer you a [**free consultation**](https://www.portugalist.com/contact/) to see if you would be able to move to Portugal.

**Why Portugal Though?** 

* **Portugal's visas are attainable** (unlike other EU countries, they're really making an effort to bring in foreigners)
* The weather (if you're going to live somewhere else, it might as well be warm)
* Actually affordable **tax-funded healthcare** (we're talking €5-20 for doctor visits)
* **Safe AF** (there's still crime, certainly, but nothing like US levels)
* HUGE perk: **After** ***less than 5 years***\*\*, you can apply for citizenship\*\* = EU passport = live anywhere in the EU, EEA, or Switzerland! (compare than to 10 in Spain).
* The language requirement for citizenship is just the A2 level (aka upper-beginner) whereas it's B1 in many other EU countries (read: harder).
* The **cost of living is affordable** (whereas you can barely get two bags of groceries for $100 in some parts of the US, you'll do your entire weekly shop for that in Portugal).

But here's the thing - while you could get sunshine and beaches in plenty of places (looking at you, Mexico and Panama), Portugal is different.

The healthcare system alone is mind-blowing for Americans. Pre-existing conditions? No problem. Age? They don't care. You're looking at €5-20 for most doctor visits, and prescriptions that won't require a second mortgage. Plus, if you want private insurance (which many expats get for faster service), it's so much cheaper than in the States.

The safety thing isn't just hype either. Portugal consistently ranks as one of the safest countries in the world. We're talking walking-alone-at-night safe, let-your-kids-play-in-the-streets safe. That's something you don't get in a lot of Asian and Latin American countries.

**Step 1: Can You Actually Move Here? The Visa Rundown (2024)**

Listen up, this is the MOST important part. Can you actually move to Portugal? Here are your options:

**D7 Visa (The Passive Income Dream)**

* Need €820/month minimum (about $885) for a single person
* Perfect for retirees, people with rental income, investments, etc.
* Got a spouse? Add 50%. Kids? Add 30% per *dependent* kid.
* You'll also need a year's worth of savings (for a single person that's €820\*12. For a couple that's €1230\*12).

Let's real talk about the D7 for a minute.

While €820 is the minimum requirement, you're probably going to want more than that to live comfortably, especially in bigger cities. Be realistic. Portugal is WAY more affordable than the US but you still need to factor in rent and other costs. That said, plenty of retirees on pensions and social security move to Portugal on this amount.

This visa is PERFECT for retirees or anyone with steady passive income.

* Pensions? Yes.
* Social security? Yep.
* Rental income? Absolutely.
* Investment dividends? You got it.

The application process is pretty straightforward compared to other visas, but you'll need to prove your income is stable and regular. One-time windfalls don't count here, although there are always exceptions to the rule.

[Read a more in-depth overview of the D7](https://www.portugalist.com/d7-visa-residency/)

**D8 Visa (Digital Nomad Life)**

* Need €3,280/month (about $3,542)
* For remote workers & freelancers (anyone working who can bring an income from outside Portugal)
* Same deal with family: +50% spouse, +30% per *dependent* kid
* PRO TIP: Check if your company allows international remote work BEFORE you get excited
* You'll also need a year's worth of savings (for a single person that's €820\*12. For a couple that's €1230\*12).

Here's what nobody tells you about the D8: while it looks perfect on paper, there are some serious gotchas to consider. First up, just because your company lets you work remotely in the US doesn't mean they'll be cool with you working from Portugal. There are tax implications, labor laws, and all sorts of fun legal stuff they'll need to figure out.

If your company says no, you've got options: either find a new remote-friendly job (preferably European) or switch to contracting. It's still doable.

**Golden Visa (The Rich Person's Backup Plan)**

* Invest €500k or donate €250k
* Only need to spend 7 days a year here
* No need to rent or buy a property here *before moving to Portugal* or show a year's worth of savings (requirements for most other visas)
* Takes forever though (18+ month backlog rn but AIMA promises this'll change)

The Golden Visa is fascinating because it's basically a backup plan. You don't even have to live in Portugal - just show up for a week each year, and you're good (14 days every 2 years officially). This is perfect if you're worried about future instability but aren't ready to make the move yet. The real beauty? You can avoid becoming a Portuguese tax resident while still getting that sweet EU residency as you only need to spend around 7 days per year here.

This is also ideal for those with savings (€500k or so) but that don't have remote jobs, freelancing income, or passive income like social security. If you're in that boat, the golden visa is a worthwhile consideration. Alternatively, you could consider buying a property to rent out so you qualify for the D7 but this may be more straightforward.

Most people go the investment fund route these days since real estate options are no longer an option. And while €500k sounds like a lot, compared to other Golden Visa programs worldwide, it's actually pretty reasonable. Some companies have schemes to reduce this investment amount and to allow you to invest through your IRA or 401k.

BUT (and it's a big but), be prepared for bureaucratic hurdles. The current backlog is insane - we're talking 18+ months. However, the government has made some changes recently - they've made it faster to move to Portugal (if that's your goal) and the time your spend waiting for your application to be approved now counts towards Portuguese citizenship.

**D2 Visa (Entrepreneurs)**

* No minimum investment needed
* Need a solid business plan
* They'll check if you can actually pull it off
* You'll also need a year's worth of savings (for a single person that's €820\*12. For a couple that's €1230\*12).

Want to start a business? The D2 or entrepreneur visa could be perfect for you.

The D2 is kind of the wild card of Portuguese visas. On paper, it looks amazing - no minimum investment required? Sign me up! But here's the reality: Portuguese immigration officials will go through your business plan with a fine-toothed comb. They want to see that you can actually support yourself AND contribute to the Portuguese economy.

Basically, if your business plan is vague or you have no experience, they have a good reason to reject you. And why wouldn't they? They're trying to avoid bringing in people who'll run out of money and have to rely on the Portuguese state.

[Read a more in-depth overview of the D2](https://www.portugalist.com/d2-visa-residency/)

**D3 Visa (Traditional Job Route)**

* Honestly? Pretty tough
* Portuguese salaries are WAY lower than US
* Finding companies to sponsor = hard mode

Let's be brutally honest about the D3: unless you're in a super specialized field or working for a multinational company, this is one of the hardest routes. Portuguese salaries might shock you - we're talking €20,000-30,000 for jobs that would pay $100k+ in the US. Plus, companies need to prove they couldn't find an EU citizen for the role before hiring you. Not impossible, but definitely playing on hard mode.

There is also the D1, which is aimed at less highly qualified individuals. However, you still need a company that's willing to hire an American. And given Portuguese companies can choose from the whole of Portugal *and* the whole of the EU/EEA/Switzerland, you'll still have to be special for them to go through the extra hassle.

[Read a more in-depth overview of the D3](https://www.portugalist.com/d3-residency-visa/)

*These aren't the only visas. You can also move as a student or volunteer, for example, but these are the main visas.*

**The Bottom Line: Is Portugal Right For You?**

Listen, Portugal is an amazing escape hatch from the US if you're looking for one. You get a safer country, affordable healthcare, better work-life balance, and that golden ticket to EU citizenship after 5 years. Plus, the food's amazing, the people are chill, and did I mention those beaches? 🏖️

But let's keep it 100% real. Moving countries is a MASSIVE life change. Here's the no-BS breakdown:

**The Good Stuff** 

* Healthcare that won't bankrupt you
* Seriously safe
* WAY lower cost of living
* That sweet, sweet EU passport after 5 years
* Amazing food, wine, and coffee culture
* Actual work-life balance
* 300+ days of sunshine (in places like the Algarve)
* Central location for traveling Europe
* Generally less stressful lifestyle

**The Reality Check** 

* Portuguese bureaucracy will test your sanity
* The language is HARD (harder than Spanish)
* Houses are cold and damp in winter
* Lower salaries if you work locally
* Customer service... exists technically
* Things move SLOWLY (like, really slowly)
* You'll daydream about American conveniences
* Property prices are getting crazy in popular areas
* Integration takes real effort

**Bottom Line:** If you've got remote work/passive income, don't mind a slower pace of life, and are ready to embrace a different culture (not just live in an expat bubble), Portugal could be your slice of paradise. Just don't expect it to be America with better healthcare and cheaper wine. Portugal is Portugal. It's different, that's all.

Remember: Visit first if you can. Talk to people who've made the move. Start learning Portuguese NOW if you're serious about this. Your future self will thank you!

And most importantly? Talk to us. We can answer all your questions.",1,1730108290.0,Portugalist,0,1.0,False

I used the same recipe for both, and the differences are remarkable (more than what i expected)

Both have a nice Herbal forward taste (Classic TW) with slight chocolate notes. The biggest difference is that the higher altitude coffee has a slight fermented taste, almost like what you would expect from a natural. TW notes “winey” as a tasting note which is interesting, since it does have a sort of boozy, fruit cider vibe. 

It is almost like the one is a washed and the other a natural of the same coffee bean, really interesting.

Things happen in our relationship and i need to know if it’s linked. ,"So, I’ve had the conversation with her. She’s feeling really bad about the way she spoke and it’s been two days now. We’ve spoken about things & tried to carry on as about as normal as you can. We’re civil. We’ve kissed, had a cuddle & been on a very small night out/cinema date. Everything was fine. 

It’s now the working week. Monday to Friday. Every night i go to sleep, i lean over to her, give her a kiss and say goodnight. She never comes to me, i always go to her. Last night, she fell asleep, this didn’t happen and i didn’t want to give her, ‘the power…?’ Not sure if this was the right thing to do. We went to sleep. Woke up this morning & usually, i don’t get a good morning or a kiss - she jumps in the shower & for years now, I’ve had to give her the time to wake up & sort herself, before i get any affection. I woke up first this morning, she was kind of awake - i left the room, made a coffee for myself & waited for her to wake up. She got straight in the shower & didn’t say a word. When she was out, i came into the bedroom & we had the most awkward exchange of kiss and morning hello’s. I drank my coffee whilst she got ready in the other room. She came in & i needed to shower - i said ‘I’m gonna go shower now, are you gonna be gone by the time I’m out?’ She said yes (which is normal to me at this point) and again, another awkward kiss and she kinda gave me a half cuddle. I said, ‘Can i have a real cuddle!?’ She gave me one and we went our separate ways. Now, i haven’t heard from her all morning, again, which is normal - but i’m afraid to text her first (we text everyday & check in) - am i going crazy? Am i overthinking things? Ive read so much about the power struggle with a Narc that I’m almost afraid to do things first now, i want to receive a good morning, a kiss first & a text first - i just want to know she feels the same urge i do to connect and talk. 

I have no idea guys, feel like I’m going crazy trying to navigate her moods and actions. Alternatively, i could be massively overthinking and just being stupid. 

(We’ve been together for 12 years - this carries on from my last post - but found the comments really helpful.)

So she went to the counter and told them that the lid was not put on well so in return it spilled on her and the thing is it was all like genuinely okay my mom just went there to tell them that they should be careful putting on the lid next time but the guy on the counter told her that they put it on well and said that maybe she removed it by herself which is frustrating cause my mom was genuinely hurt since the coffee is hot and do you think someone in their right mind would do what he was trying to say like bro what the hell is wrong with you. You could have just said sorry like genuinely say sorry and everything would have been okay. Customer service sucks ass cause we also ordered a cheesecake but they like sliced it not evenly and half of the bottom of the cake was not there likeeee please fix thiss. This is not the first time that me and my family went to this branch but like the customer service like downgraded like a lot. Please fix this guys like seriously such a bad fucking experience.

I’ve (26F) been in love with my best friend (25M) of two years since the early stages of our friendship. 

I barely had crushes growing up, let alone seriously “liked” someone. When I saw this guy at a store couple of years ago, it was love at first sight. I even texted my friend that day “I’m gonna marry that guy” well, obviously I didn’t see him for the next few years, it was just someone I felt a strong connection to, and a silly comment from me.

Couple years later I met him again at a coffee shop, didn’t even know it was him. But we ended up talking for 6 hours when we met and we ended up sharing our deepest secrets. He told me things he has told nobody in his life, the very first day of meeting me. It was insane, a cosmic connection once again. I realized on day two that this was the guy from the store, I said to myself “I am going to marry this guy” once again. It was so weird and not on brand for me, but I just knew I would grow to love him, and I did.

Two years later, he’s my best friend. We’ve gone through SO much together, we’ve talked everyday, we met almost everyday and at some point we even lived in the same apartment together. I am truly in love with him. He has his flaws, I do not see him as perfect at all and being with him would near be impossible due to life circumstances, but God do I truly love him and all the imperfections, and would be willing to fight through all just to be with him.

His life is pretty messed up and sad and has always been, but now it’s unbearable and despite me doing everything I could to make it better, sometimes it just doesn’t work. He is moving CONTINENTS soon. I will never see him again because from where we are from, if you move continents it would be about 10-15 years before you can visit your home country.

My love for him is unrequited, his love for me is platonic. I know we are attached but I think because of his life problems he has detached himself from me lately.

Every part of my heart and body hurts when I think I will not see him again. He will never truly know I loved him more than anything. I won’t get to marry him. I can’t even begin to IMAGINE anyone on his place. I truly don’t understand how I can ever love anyone else. Every corner of the town we walked together will forever be hunted by his memory.
I have so many pieces of clothing and fragrances that remind me of him because he complimented them. Many pieces of clothes we chose together. My whole life lately has had his name plastered all over it and I truly do not understand how I will be able to move from this. How I can walk these streets and know he is not in close proximity.

For the sensory issues, I'm working on slowly adapting my wardrobe to my new needs (I have a newfound stomach sensitivity and everything that's tight around the belly button is painful at worst and annoying at best). I'm also going 'down' in the sense that it's now my first priority when I'm building an outfit, and I think that will last until my wardrobe is more adapted to my new needs.

But for the fit/neat freak issues, I'm stuck. I'll give you 2 exeamples so that you get what I mean:

\- I'm currently growing out a pixie. I'm a the weird stage between a lixie and a short bob. I also have thick, stlightly wavy hair that tends to curl a the ends. It's almost impossible to get something neat (by my standards) atm: I need more length so that the weight of my hair makes it easier to manage. I know it, but I will still get sooo frustrated to have one piece of hair that sticks out awkwardly. I'm probably the only one noticing it, but I can't get over it.

\- fit issues: I hate not having a flowing, harmonious silhouette. Today I'm wearing wide leg pants, a top and a cardigan. I left the cardigan open, until I realized that I somehow I managed to splash coffee on my top. I thought 'ok, no biggie, I'll button the cardigan'. Only when buttoned up, it bunches awkwardly just above my hips, creating like a fold on each side that I could \*feel\*. It's not much but it was almost physically uncomfortable to me, drove me to distraction, and I ended up opening it again - and showing the world what a klutz I am. Writing it I wonder if it's really a fit issue or if it's more sensory too...

It was so weird and not on brand for me, but I just knew I would grow to love him, and I did.

Two years later, he’s my best friend. We’ve gone through SO much together, we’ve talked everyday, we met almost everyday and at some point we even lived in the same apartment together. I am truly in love with him. He has his flaws, I do not see him as perfect at all and being with him would near be impossible due to life circumstances, but God do I truly love him and all the imperfections, and would be willing to fight through all just to be with him.

His life is pretty messed up and sad and has always been, but now it’s unbearable and despite me doing everything I could to make it better, sometimes it just doesn’t work. He is moving CONTINENTS soon. I will never see him again because from where we are from, if you move continents it would be about 10-15 years before you can visit your home country.

My love for him is unrequited, his love for me is platonic. I know we are attached but I think because of his life problems he has detached himself from me lately.

Every part of my heart and body hurts when I think I will not see him again. He will never truly know I loved him more than anything. I won’t get to marry him. I can’t even begin to IMAGINE anyone on his place. I truly don’t understand how I can ever love anyone else. Every corner of the town we walked together will forever be hunted by his memory.
I have so many pieces of clothing and fragrances that remind me of him because he complimented them. Many pieces of clothes we chose together. My whole life lately has had his name plastered all over it and I truly do not understand how I will be able to move from this. How I can walk these streets and know he is not in close proximity.

It hurts so much. I can’t begin to explain how much.",2,1730107429.0,unrequited_love,0,1.0,False

1gdxrwq,https://i.redd.it/etjnhcfysgxd1.jpeg,Podcast episode recap,"You know someone has run out of topics to discuss on the podcast when they announce at the beginning of the episode that it’s going to be all about poop and pee. 😬

She says she wants her moon child to have a “magical unicorn childhood” and that’s why she’s throwing this Halloween extravaganza.

She says that she was chill about this whole thing thinking that nobody was going to enter her “sanctuary - a clean and tidy home” yeah right! We’ve all seen how clean and tidy her dining room and bathroom are 🤨 and she’s going to serve hotdogs on paper plates guys! So ancestral isn’t it? 🤣

She started panicking when someone pointed out “where is everyone going to go to the bathroom?” She says the thought of 60 strangers with their kids stomping through her house with their shoes on to use her sacred bathroom gives her the ick. So she decides to order a porta potty. But she can’t even have it delivered, she needs to go and pick it up. And when she says “I” she means Dennis needs to pick it up. 

She says her single biggest fear in life is having to step into a porta potty. Wow! Just shows how little she has to worry about in her life if that is her biggest fear 🙄 and she makes all these gagging sounds as she talks about the thought of having to enter a porta potty. But she has no problem ordering one for her guests! it’s good enough for them, but it’s not good enough for her obviously! 

She says that when she’s out and she needs to go to the bathroom and the only option is a porta potty, She will control her body to make sure she doesn’t need to go. She will go to any length to avoid going into a porta potty. Even the thought of Dennis taking Lea into a porta potty when she needs to go, it’s too much for her to bear. She feels that if Lea enters a porta potty, her whole body is going to be soiled and she can no longer hold her hand or be near her. 😳 She says anyone who enters a porta potty needs to stay away from her. She says “i don’t know why I’m like this. Most people are not excited at the thought of going into a porta potty but if they need to go, they just do it because they have to. And it’s not a big deal but for me it is a big deal.” 

Honestly I couldn’t believe the words that were coming out of her mouth in this podcast. The amount of arrogance and privilege that was oozing through her - the way she talks about how disgusting porta potties are and how everyone who goes into one needs to stay away from her, including her own child! what the fuck is wrong with her?? so all these people that are coming to your party, after they go to the bathroom they’re not allowed to come near you anymore? 

She says that whenever they are out and Lea needs to go to the bathroom, Dennis needs to take her. Rachel will not take her to the bathroom. 

And then she goes “do you know the story about Mexico? I feel like I’ve shared the story on the podcast before, but I don’t wanna tell it again. Ewwww I don’t wanna tell it again!” 🙄 so don’t fucking tell it again then ! Fucking hell! She says what happened to her in Mexico is was “the single worst moment of her life.” I guess worse than her mother trying to commit suicide several times, her stepfather dying in a plane crash, her best friend dying in a car crash etc etc.? No.. This experience is the worst one. WOW! She is really something else! 

So she says that they were in Cozumel because Dennis was doing an Iron Man there and it was the first day of the trip. They stopped at a gas station and Lea had to go to the bathroom for number 2, and she starts blaming Lea! “How dare my daughter need to go to the bathroom in public.” So Dennis says “I’ll take her” but she doesn’t trust him and she thinks he’s not gonna do a good enough job. She doesn’t trust her husband to be able to manage this situation. So she ends up going go the bathroom with Lea and tries her best to avoid touching anything while she’s in there. She even holds Lea up in the air while she’s pooping so that Lea won’t touch anything and then while she was wiping her bottom and pulling her pants up, Rakel bent over and her hair fell into the toilet. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the single worst moment of this woman’s life. Let’s have a moment of silence for thoughts and prayers everyone! 🙏🏻🤣

She says “I wouldn’t go to a gas station bathroom. Obviously. That’s not going to happen. Ever. And if I’m out and the only option is a porta potty, I’m not going to go. And if Lea needs to go, she’s also not going to go. She needs to will her body into submission. That’s just not going to happen.” Wow!! 😳

it really pisses me off how judgmental and disrespectful these comments are towards people who have no other option but to go to the bathroom at a gas station or a porta potty for example construction workers, laborers, truck drivers, etc.. people who actually work hard and are the backbone of society. but no, princess Rakel is too good for the porta potty and the gas station bathroom.

And then I think she realizes how stupid she sounds because she claims that she cleans the chicken coop every few days, and she feels the need to say “but chickens are not gross! Nobody is as gross as adult male humans. Women don’t do unspeakable things in the public bathrooms the way that men do. the reason that public bathrooms are so gross is because of men, not women.  There is no pee on the toilet seat or on the floor in the women’s bathrooms.” Ummmm.. That’s absolute nonsense. I have seen some atrocious women’s public bathrooms! 🤢🤮

Then she asks “Why is it socially acceptable for boys to pee in public and not for girls? Why isn’t it normalized for girls to pee in the bush? Is it because girl’s genitals are considered shameful? We don’t allow girls to touch themselves down there in public, or itch themselves when they have the need.” This is not the first time that she talks about this topic and I don’t know why she’s so obsessed about it. She spends way too much time thinking about this, and why does she keep talking about itching your lady bits? Rakel, you need to see a fucking doctor because it’s not normal for you to be itchy down there all the time! 😬

She then tells the story about how some guy exposed and touched himself while watching her do yoga on the beach in Aruba. 

And finally she talks about her brother and gives an update on the swimming prank that she was doing with him over the summer. And basically the update is that there is no outcome of this prank because he suddenly  left and moved to the north of Sweden. He only gave a few days notice before moving, which is an odd this tho do if you cows. who’s going to take care of the cows? Seems like taking care of farm animals isn’t really a priority for the brathen family, it’s obvious that they have people behind the scenes doing the hard work for them. She also feels the need to say that he’s in between jobs right now and that’s why it’s easy for him to just pack up and leave. Sure, if you say so Rachel! And in the next breath she says that she misses him so much because he basically lived at her house. he came over for breakfast 3 to 4 times a week. He came over for dinner almost every night, they would go for swims during the day. he’ll call her in the middle of the day and they’ll catch up over coffee. What kind of job was he doing that he was able to do all of that? stop lying Rachel! None of you are working ok? just be honest about it! 

She also says “I’ve been working a lot more since he left. I’ve been getting a lot of important work done and moved some important things forward.” Huh.. what could this “important work” be? 🤔",3,1730107196.0,rachelbrathensnark,2,1.0,False

I'm on a mission to buy an Espresso machine. I used to have a fully automatic Siemens coffee machine which was giving me crap coffee. I got fed up with it after 2 years and got rid of it yesterday.

Now I have my eye on the Sage Barista Express line up. My main candidate is the pure Express model which has been around for years and is tried and true but there are also the newer Impress and Express Impress models with built-in tamper and automatic dosing systems.

My first question is whether it's worth the extra \~>200 euros to buy those models.

I'm not a coffee geek but I can appreciate a good espresso so the automatic dosing system may be helpful to me in getting the right amount of coffee in the portafilter. The built-in tamper could also help me with the tamping and the cleaning without much effort on my side. But I don't know to what extent they could be helpful.

There is also another option of going with the Bambino models and getting a separate grinder to put next to it. I believe the standalone grinder would offer more range and options for grinding than the Express models.

I'd appreciate the sharing of your knowledge and experience.",1,1730107149.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I am very pleased that the first volume of my book, The Dark Healer, has sparked such great interest among readers. Thank you for your warm reviews!

In the second volume, the story of the Richter clan continues. Max will encounter his first serious enemies and allies, as well as start his own business.

Some readers have asked why I chose a necromancer to take on the role of Healer. To me, it makes sense — life and death are closely intertwined. Few know more about the human body than a necromancer.

In my book, necromancers can manipulate a special type of energy that exists in both the living and the dead. This allows them to both heal and kill.

The main character, Prince Max Richter, is unlike the typical necromancer. Though he is a thousand years old, he fits seamlessly into modern society: he loves coffee and dark humor, drives a sports car, adores his pets, and cares tenderly for his granddaughter.

Max also has a deep love for mysteries — for instance, he’s driven to discover who wiped out his entire clan and nearly killed him as well.

Do I still rock up?,"I understand this is not really a “relationship” but I’ve been chatting to a guy for about 6 weeks now who I have seen at my local coffee shop (my favourite one) and matched with him on Tinder. The first week or two we saw each other twice, I stayed over and it was really bloody good. However, he was a bit flaky and eventually was honest about saying he just wasn’t ready to keep hanging out for now as he was 9ish months out of a 9 year relationship. We still chatted and he kept saying things like he was feeling better, said some very sweet lovey dovey things still, potentially to keep me strung along, but you be the judge of that. I’m about to go away for 5 or 6 weeks, he asked to go for lunch recently and I thought oh maybe he’s keen, then he said he was sick and had to cancel.

Now that things have ended abruptly, is it a power move to still go in for my coffee, as if nothing happened? Or will that be strange?

All of the volunteers started as users that needed help and gradually volunteered to help other users again.

And vice versa, this is not donation-model project that someone would throw the money and demand others to ""get off your ass"" for their issues. We have real lives outside of uBO project. We want to feel free and have motivations to help solve the issues when we can in our spare time, not to be burdened by the pressure of the donations. If we don't feel comfortable with a specific investigation method, we are free to refuse that method. If anyone is expecting a demanded kind of project, you come to the wrong one and are free to look for other tools suitable for your expectations.

We don't try to solve all issues on the internet. That's impossible. We don't put announcements for specific website's issues. Since we have limited free time, if issues of a website become too much or too repetitive for us to manage or drown other websites' reports, we will try to find a more convenient way to deal with (pinned thread, auto-mods...). That's it.

About netflix issue, if I'm not wrong, none of the volunteers lives in US where the ads subscription is available. Even if I personally can pay for an account, I can't investigate the issue either because netflix in my country does not have the paid-for-ads tier. Instead of demanding the work from volunteers of a FOSS project, it's better to object the corporations that practice anti-user behaviors: paywall to watch ads, geo-locked and even IP-locked.",82,1730105957.0,uBlockOrigin,13,1.0,False

Pre existing issues : Asthma, Hypothyroidism (both medicated). Elevated cholesterol & high triglycerides for many years now. 
Height 169cm, weight 96kg

Due to asthma I couldnt be an active kid, I also used to get sick a lot (I still do). I'm guessing the inactive lifestyle + the medications etc lead upto me being overweight overtime.

I've been trying to reduce weight the last few years. I started with working out (burning around 500-1000 calories a day) and didn't really see any results. I had to also start calorie cutting. I was down to only consuming less than 1000 calories a day.

The wight reduced to 88 kg after 12 weeks of it but it came at a cost of significant muscle atrophy & some mental health issues. After a certain point i got extremely lethargic & i could no longer maintain the same diet (i would physically feel sick if I tried to eat the same things I used to eat). Honestly I feel traumatized by the diet/work out i did.

I gained back the weight to 94kg in a couple months of ""normal"" diet. It's been a year of that now.

Now that i feel well enough to loose weight again (and i don't have much time to workout anymore) I started intermittent fasting, I eat once a day 5/6 days a week and that meal would be around 1400 calories. I don't snack throughout the day (maybe a sugar free coffee once a day), i don't use sugar (my dad and grandparents are diabetic) & I managed to gain 2.5 kgs in 2 months by doing this.

I'm at such a loss, I have no idea what to do anymore. I'm always dismissed by doctors saying ""I just need to eat less sugar and have healthier foods"". I don't eat sugar or processed food. Most of my food are chicken with some vegs and fruits on the side. Maybe beef or pork once a week

I really desperately trying to be healthier but I can't keep putting my body through hell and not have anything to show for it.",0,1730105666.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

On the drive there, as I entered the intersection of K Road and Queen Street, two crackheads who were running around on the road decided to start what seemed like an attempt to kick boxing in the middle of the intersection right in front of my car. I hit the brakes and waited for them to clear the way during which the lights went red. As I was already in the intersection, I steered around them and continued on.

Now, there is debate going on in the group on whether this gets me a ticket. One of the boys and I are of the opinion that it wont as I was already in the intersection and I cleared the intersection when the lights went red while the others say that I ran a red light and I need to pay up.

Nearly every brand sells exclusively through those, no direct sales (we have a Shopify websites with thousands of visits/month and had only 1 sale in total vs thousands on those marketplaces).

We are just starting running ads outside of those marketplaces, we focus exclusively on Instagram atm (we remove all other options from the placement). We have very specific custom audiences (Specialty coffee professionals and such) that give us CPR of 450 to 1000 depending on the content.

We just started experimenting with Advantage+ and we see CPR of 1600 and more. We use controlled audiences and audience suggestion based on our existing audiences. We are experimenting exclusively with awareness campaigns.

  
My questions are:

* Should we expect the Advantage+ results to improve over time?
* Does Advantage+ make sense when you don't have any data from the Pixel or from the catalog?
* Does it make sense for Awareness/Reach campaigns?
* More broadly, does it make sense to run sales (through traffic for instance) campaigns on e-marketplaces or should we stick to awareness and reach?

As you get older, your body becomes less adapted to processing lactose. A treat every now and again is fine. Helps move along the bowels.

By default cheese cost extra when I was growing up. Now all of a sudden we're paying for the cheese whether we want to or not. In more ways than one.

The only time I consider eating dairy is if it's with my coffee, where bowel movements are inevitable (I don't even drink coffee-coffee. just frappuccinos every so often), or if I want to treat myself. In this case, I use lactase pills.

But man, does it seem like the US wants all of its citizens to have bad bacteria in their gut due to the good ones being flushed out through diarrhea every single day. Not having a steady amount of good bacteria in the gut can disrupt the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin. The reduction of this neurotransmitter has been linked to A-ism, impulsivity, and gen-anx.

I have asked for sandwiches with no cheese before, and the employees are so used to putting cheese on every single sandwich that I end up getting cheese anyway and have to return the sandwich. Not only is this process time consuming, but the employees behave as if it's irrational to complain that your food isn't made to order.

The house is too small with 4 of us so he typically stays in a travel trailer outside but comes inside to eat, drink coffee (A LOT of coffee haha) and use the bathroom, shower etc; That is not a problem though I wish he would ask if this or that weekend (or whatever days) were okay rather than just saying “I’m coming” typically the day of or the day before arrival. I have a TON of anxiety issues (GAD, social anxiety disorder, panic attacks etc;) but I function half normally…or at least until it means people coming into my safe spaces. I can go and be around other people (not all the time but if I know I need to go I can often prepare myself mentally) but it’s only because my brain is aware that I am able to leave and “escape” whenever necessary (which never usually happens. The problem is this: He NEVER respects the fact that I would like some notice that he’s coming and brining other people (other family members) with him. They are my family and I love them sooo much but unlike him, I’m not used to having 15 people living in my house and bringing their friends and girlfriends/boyfriends over to stay all the time. All that I ask is that he considers ASKING me if such and such dates would be okay and if so and so (adult nieces or nephews and girlfriends/boyfriends) would be okay to come stay. I like to be accommodating and be a good “host” but it not only takes preparation physically to ensure food, coffee, tidy up etc; but for me it takes a lot mentally and emotionally to just prepare to not have my safe space to myself. I feel like such a jerk but he’s about just pushing me out of my comfort zone and it honestly just makes it worse and makes me not want to have anyone come at all. I’m a single mom to two young children and I have a boyfriend (not the father and doesn’t assist me with kids) and I take care of everything…I’m in a 24/7 state of overwhelm and overstimulation it feels haha. Is it too much to ask that I know he doesn’t understand it and I don’t need him to like it but I need him to respect it and give me a little notice even though it’s my family?

1gdxdl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gdxdl9/milk_steaming_issue_miicoffee_apex_v11/,Milk steaming issue [MiiCoffee Apex V1.1],"Morning all,

After much deliberation I bought an Apex v1.1 last week. The espresso side of things has been great, now have a recipe that produces consistent results. 

My partner prefers milky drinks (flat white or latte) and I'm not sure if there is an issue with the steam circuit on our machine. From my reading/research before buying I know the Apex has a separate thermo block circuit for the steamer. Also read that it can benefit from a purge prior to starting steaming.

However I can't seem to get the machine to produce consistent high pressure steam. The purging can take 60+ secs before a consistent flow of steam is being produced and even then the pressure seems to be very low and not able to incorporate enough air into the milk? It will eventually get hot but spends most of it's time screaming and can't get a decent microfoam. 

Is this just a feature of the Apex or is there something wrong with my machine? ",1,1730105328.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

It was a long day, and you were walking down a busy city sidewalk without watching where you were going.

You tripped.

Your coffee spilled onto the suit of a tall, masculine, and handsome man who looked like the devil taking the shape of your deepest desires.

His voice was deep, and you were mesmerized by his presence.

My favourite CoDs were BO1 and BO2, and then BO4 and Cold War (pretty much the only other 2 CoDs I played) were a lot faster, but I still really enjoyed them, and only stopped playing once my mates did. I’ve played a bunch of covid-era Warzone too. 

But BO6 feels like another psychotic step above that in terms of speed. Sure I’ve only played a few games, but it just feels like I have to be at 100% brainpower obsessively focussed the entire game. And that’s before any SBMM has kicked in (I was a decent 1.8-2.2 player on the other games I mentioned)



I was also playing on Control, which became my favourite mode from BO4 onwards because of the linearity and fixed spawns sides, but even that felt like an insane headless chicken rush fest of people sprinting and sliding around at warp speed from every angle. 

—————-

I saw someone online say this is the same movement speed as Cold War but that can’t be right? They seem words apart, I felt fine playing Cold War right from the start.

Playing those 2 games of BO6, I just feel completely exhausted and having very little desire to play another. Are these games just designed for G-fuel sniffing kids with tiktok attention spans nowadays and not for 20-something year olds who enjoyed past CoDs?

My 

Heart. 

My heart dropped into thy stomach,

And I felt my chest lighter,

You're the destruction of me, 

You can make me burn down, or burn brighter. 

Even with your tears,

I feel your sadness like the rain,

I sense your truth through the back Alley's of your 

darkness,

I contributed to your chaos,

My chance to be your best friend,

Years ago I lost. 

Her silent treatment,

Is a folded note, in a glass bottle, floating in the sea.

Watching your sadness with it, watching you rid yourself 

Of me,

The connection I strained, your feelings I caged,

You're more fulfilled alone than you were willed in my

presence.

Every piece of me crumbles, 

You still seemed fooled by my demeaner. 

I'm trying to find a way to hit my marks in an urgent way,

While absorbing it a little slower,

I want to catch up to you,

Because I know too much to lose,

Love is the faint glow of a star, far away to be love, 

One shant cast eyes upon the past of its light, to then expect it to 

Create the day once again, 

Such as two souls, could not make a home of ruins, without

Sharing the caring on both sides of the truth,

Behind my rib cage, it feels there is a hole,

No more throwing my heart into the wishing well,

Losing you was losing me; from grace I fell,

Displaced and outnumbered, by my long list of grievances

No cash out, no insight, no discernment of time. 

People are grateful,

When they understand their purpose,

They do what they can, to not give in,

To what hurts others, is what hurt them. 

I truly didn't know what you wanted of me, recently,

But a light text, under a midnight sky, felt more of a hex,

Than a hope to understand, eye to eye. 

As well I saw your cryptic messages,

About lusting through the tangled webs,

I knew if we don't go for coffee,

The evening lure of a murky word, can't not bend.

I just wish you could be honest,

Say what you truly wanted,

While I leave my old history,

Of running my resentment off the tongue,

And lead with progress,

Finally something to show,

Once again I've regained some patience,

The more urgent the timing, the slower the time goes,

I can't make this about impressing,

Appeasing, or people pleasing,

I can't make this about money, though a catch-22,

I prefer to see my life as a purpose, 

As the seeds to flowers bloom,

Where one could plant something more useful,

Such as food,

Though enjoyment is the flower,

The energy is took catch ones eyes,

The aura is takes almost sparkles in the light.

If I could tell you what is true,

I'm pushing to see what I need to,

I feel I have some adroitness, coupled of insight,
 
That are more worthy of my time,

Than this fleabag of an operation,

Is barren compared to my vocation. 

Please hold have just a little more patience,

As my true line of work will show a little something. 

Not a quick song to illustrate sac-religious music. 

But a whole lot of love, to the passion of my choosing. 

My inclinations are not feathers on the wind,

They're the deepest seeds I have planted, 

And scared to lose my privacy in the twist.

Usually that part of the movie, is the most poetic.

We only get this life, as we know,

And I used it to abuse and run from you. 

I was too afraid of needing you like I did,

To love me like Ive never been. 

Its always been you. 

I know it's always been her. 

I'm at a stand still on how I feel the glue,

Pulling away with my reservations melted in truth,

I so innately, don't want to lose good people to the 

Outpour of arrogance and their changing to hate me,

My intent has always been to be different than my

Mind as always made it. 

My heart screams the possibilities,

My mind gathers distraction like twigs,

To build fires for everyone's preference,

As warmth can make all the people you love,

Stand in a room and get along,

Even as they sing the tune of different songs,

And judge what the dark keeps hidden,

Like you seeing me try,

I'm over here contemplating what I do have for resources

And if this death of working for bolder reasons, is the 

Truth I need to stand behind?

Temporary is true,

But it feels so wrong,

A needed change,

But trying is stupid, 

And you're trying to be kind,

When you see me making a remark that hurts,

I know you were  not fond of it, I feel exumed. 

Exposed. 

Like I can't matter with any part of me, private or closed. 

I only assume,

What telegrams mean, under the moon,

If the daylight is too busy, for you to consider me,

The way I pray to show that I respect you. 

But then I'm reminded,

That my time was wasted,

And this was half of the love,

You had for someone, 

And I would be restless, 

Staring my work in the face. 

Wondering where you are, if you're okay,

If someone other than me has your attention,

Cause I couldnt keep it,

And you care a little bit not too much to be like me,

Wearing my scars. 

You'd be the boat, in a rough ocean,

And I, would want to be anything less than that to you,

My betrayal got here first, melting the foundations,

Incinerating candles and incantations,

My way of hypnotizing you,

When I fall helplessly into your eyes,

Wondering if I can make you be real with me this time.

To heal, it can't be a manikan with which we dress to

Appear to the street that my soul is for you,

But your heart won't be, but your eyes say more, as to only 

Emancipate peace. 

Though it seems as so. 

It's perfectly fine. 'Fine'

You're my match made in heaven, 

And I'm your afterthought, aqua vitae, with a lime.

I really did this life wrong, hence forth,

If there shall be another time,

It is you, I will always remember in death,

It is you I will always seek to find. 

Burning my candle at both ends,

 Chasing the attraction to have you see me truthfully,

It's a weakened state when my skill sets shakey,

And your list is bountiful, and I think not to covet,

But I desire the simplest, the foraged values and morals

From the integrity of character trying to be torn to shreds

It's a powerful wish, to want this. 

When my heart flutters with desire, 

Pressing my plasticity into a frenzy,  politics is a plastic

Life,  

A burden on the mind, a distracted force field, 

I'll do what I want, with an open mind,

I need help with my backing away from

What shall never serve my purpose,

Exposing ego, it's a tragic thing,

When a plan unravels, the noise is too loud,

And then I hear your song come over me,

And I can't cry. 

As I listen to each part of your songs,

The melody, the rhythm, the tempo, the accents, with 

harmonious subtle tones,

Nothing too complex, that it sounds of too many voices,

Competing for the microphone. 

Just water, made to sound simple,

Giving life with perspective at just exact timing.


You're an angel.

I'm praying not to be the damned. 

But you have the code,

And Ive live a life, I barely connected to, 

Felt lost in the cold, though usually it feels good,

But this wasn't the mood,

As cold wind can be harsh on your face,

And leave permanent life redness,

Appearing as disheveled and shrewdly buffeted.

Your halo to push ahead,

Your watching her, keep her cool,

Not losing the sights up ahead. 

You drew your swords when you needed to,

Concerned yourself with carrying out vengeance,

When the demons got to you,

If you ever gave me the time of day,

Instead of luring me into the night with glossy humor

Over mystery and luck,

Id show you different emotions,

You think I derived from her,

When truth is,I'm tuned in, finding path to place,

I'll never lack,

New energy, new eyes,

It's not promising, the strings tied,

I want to glow this up,

And change to blow this up,

In ways,

People never notice me before,

But the ones who find it more organized than

Past scores, of scholars who ask me how I know,

About this and that. 

I loathe misinformation, and I find time to be a vicious 

Frienemy with slow when you're learning, 

And catapult when love is building,

Strident yet delightful,

Bountiful moments ellicit  cries for years,

Sedentary thinking dries out the inner child's heart,

Limiting it's light, to finding beauty in the art. 

If my mind is loud, your mind must be a busy city,

Trying to mix patience with creativity,

And dead people listening,

So your conversations are limiting. 

I can't imagine living in that,

And still winning. ",1,1730105223.0,u_Itsalwaysdarkhere86,0,1.0,False

If shares don’t assume an Nvidia-like trajectory soon, he stands to see more than $100 million in paper value wiped out.","Since Gelsinger became Intel CEO on Feb. 15, 2021, shares have dropped 63% to $22.68 at Friday’s close from $61.81.

Shares of the chip maker have lost more than half their value for the year to date alone, and set a multiyear low of $18.51 on Sept. 10. Intel stock last traded below $19 in October 2010.

If Intel stock doesn’t trade at $148.95 for 90 calendar days by Feb. 15, 2026—about 16 months from now, the fifth anniversary of Gelsinger’s hiring—outperformance PSUs with an accounting value of $45.7 million at the grant date will be canceled.

If shares don’t trade at $74.47 for those same time parameters, performance stock options valued at $29.1 million are gone. If shares don’t reach $64.54, $34.2 million of strategic growth PSUs will wither and die.

Hitting $64.54, $74.47, and $148.95 would require Intel stock to rocket 185%, 228%, and 557%, respectively, from Friday’s close.

Looks unreachable. And it's unlikely that the wave of planned layoffs and the cancellation of free coffee and tea for employees at Intel Israel, as reported on Sunday, October 27, will contribute to such growth.

Im Using a throwaway account because my wife uses Reddit and knows my username. We’ve been together nearly 12 years and married for 7 with one child (3yo). 

To make a long story as short as possible, we have had our ups and downs like any couple does. About a year ago however my world came crashing down when she called me to tell me she got caught stealing money from my aunt and uncle. She was at their house visiting my aunt for coffee (something not unusual for them as they had a great relationship. It’s important to note my parents and I don’t get along well, and they’re not involved in our lives or my child’s. I don’t necessarily blame my wife for this, as I had serious issues with them on my own, but knowing what I know now, I do wonder if she manipulated a lot of the goings on in the last 4-5 years when everything went sour with them, but that is for another post- suffice to say, my aunt and uncle were like my parents in a sense and a bonus “grandma and grandpa” for our child)

Anyway, she got caught, they made her return whatever she had stolen ( that day) and when I got home I eventually called my aunt to apologize with tears, she never blamed me, was empathetic to me and my child, we are still always welcome, etc. but my wife was obviously no longer welcome. This hurt, I don’t blame them for their reaction, but it’s made it hard for me to navigate that “family life” without her. And I resent her (my wife) for it. 

The reason she was stealing money is because she was hiding nearly $30k in credit card debt from me. Another shock. I could’ve forgiven this had she come to me, I would’ve been upset, but it could’ve been worked through. But this just ruined me. Trust was gone, resentment filled the room, and I was a shell of myself for a few weeks. She was diagnosed as bipolar/manic depressive in the following months after everything happened. I’ve tried to be supportive during that journey for her. But a part of me can’t accept that as an excuse or reason for doing what she did. Even if it is viable. (And idk if it is or not) 

 It has been pretty awful since this has occurred. We have more bad days than good, we constantly fight (and she doesn’t fight fair, she’ll say things to our child or in front of them, she’ll get loud, in my face threaten suicide, etc etc). I’m no saint, I’ve raised my voice plenty of times, but I make a conscious effort to shield our kid from our bullshit, and even with my requests for her to do the same, she won’t.  I’d say I’m pretty checked out. And she knows it. I’m stuck between doing what I think I know is right for me, her, and our child. Or continuing to try and salvage something that I don’t even know if I want to salvage it. I don’t know if I can. 

So yeah, that’s where I am. I would love any advice, feedback, similar stories/experiences. Thanks for reading. And I apologize if this isn’t a typical post, but this seemed like the best place for me to get some advice/feedback/support.",1,1730104919.0,Divorce_Men,1,0.67,False

Based in Silicone Valley, California, my chances that the average California resident employed by reddit accepting my appeal was very low.

If they had looked at the subreddits I joined, which they probably did, they would have probably said ""Oh, you're one of those guys, reject appeal""

The charges they applied for the reason of the ban felt like they were being selective on what they chose to understand and there are far more people that deserve this but get away with it 

Now I'll admit, I was playing fuck around and find out a lot and being involved in subreddits with opposing beliefs to the ""Watchers"" probably wasn't helping me be elusive to their searches

And playing around on the social media giant's platform that most likely re-employed all the Twitter buyout refugees isn't a good idea.

If there's anything to takeaway from this it's that facts don't matter to most, it's mainstream opinion. that no matter how much you argue you won't change their way of thinking. You will always end up arguing in defense of your opinion.

1gdx9yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1gdx9yk/the_period_repair_manual/,The period repair manual,"I'm reading it rn and tbh I'm finding it incredibly invalidating as someone with pme. There is only one section on pms, nothing on pme/pmdd. She does mention pmdd in the pms chapter, but she's very much in the camp that natural progesterone is good for you, and completely ignores the experience of people like us, who are effectively allergic to our natural progesterone. She's also very anti hormonal birth control, because she considers them to be poor replacements for our natural hormones. I totally respect that hormonal birth control isn't for everyone, I myself have only taken it once with miserable side effects, and am on the fence about trying again, but here I also see a lot of people having benefitted from slynd and Yaz, so I think for people like us specifically, it's really hurtful to tell us that our natural hormones are so good for us and shouldn't be replaced. 

The last note I have is that she recommends cutting out sugar for insulin resistance, and cutting out dairy for various other issues, she doesn't seem to grasp that the majority of people do not have the money to ""eat clean"" so to speak, and that the replacements we currently have for sugar and dairy aren't for everyone. I personally detest the taste of replacement milks, and while I do have xylitol in my coffee, I have yet to find a decent sugar free chocolate bar or cereal bar. I'm also just a little uncomfortable with demonising an entire food group, despite my pcos I have been able to lose a substantial amount of weight (90kg to 77kg) all while drinking cows milk and eating chocolate bars, and that has almost certainly improved my insulin resistance to some degree. 

All in all, I was a little suspicious reading a book from a self professed naturopath, as I don't generally buy into alternative medicines (no disrespect if alternative medicines work for you, I myself am big on supplements), and while I am grateful someone bothered to write a reasonably comprehensive book on periods, I think once again, pmdd/pme-ers have been left out in the cold. I spent £8 on this book, and I regret it. I wish that women's health got the funding and research it deserves, and that our doctors were fully educated on what we go through, NGL I've learned an embarrassing amount about pme and pcos right here on Reddit, because we're all out here trying to mcgyver ourselves back together, and I think the author of the period repair manual is one of many people taking advantage of our desperation and lack of healthcare.",2,1730104848.0,PMDD,1,1.0,False

I was walking to work this morning and happened to pass over a bridge. Because it's Monday and I'm not too excited to be at work (I'm working as a switchman for the local train company - many weird scenarios there), I decided to stop and look at the tracks. 

While I observed and casually drank my morning coffee, my old Philosophy 101 professor happened to walk over the bridge as well and asked me what I was doing. I was happy that he remembered me and I gladly engaged in the conversation about utilitarianism. 

During the conversation I noticed a man and his 50 children sitting on the train tracks and a train happened to be approaching. In a twist of irony (and because it's very funny) I decided to push my old professor down the bridge, because he's clearly fine with it.

Long story short - everyone died, because trains weigh like a lot and a fat man doesn't, so I effectively killed a man who judges moral decision by the result of a calculator.

Do I just need to effectively ignore every 3rd month in my spending breakdown, and look at the 3 monthly preset to get an overall idea of percentages spent? Or would I be better served categorising it as RTA/income? Or making a tax refund category?

Due to unforeseen circumstances (people moving away) I'm looking for a platonic cuddle buddy who values companionship and physical touch the way I do.

About Me:

I'm Welsh, and need my cwtches! This is pretty much just a Welsh word meaning cuddles. I enjoy both thoughtful conversation and thoughtful, comfortable silence. 

I'm a musician and drummer, so there's a possibility of me absent-mindedly tapping away on you as we cuddle. I've been told this can be very relaxing. 

I'm a bit of a nerd (surprise, it's Reddit!)

About You:

I'm looking for someone who's friendly, respectful, and fine with things being purely platonic.

It's absolutely essential that you're a strong communicator, and that you're comfortable speaking about your boundaries and needs.

Ideally you have mischievous dark humour, and are fluent in sarcasm.

Logistics:

Let's go for a walk first, to establish connection and also to ascertain that neither of us is a catfishing pervert. This would be during a weekday evening between 6 and 9.

Once we successfully navigate that mildly awkward first encounter, I'm open to coffee, walks (with arm-linking or hand holding), cinema, or heading back to my place to watch movies/series/sports, play Wordle and other games, and generally just make each others' day a whole lot better!

# 1. Saiko - 

Rozaana Blend: new to the game, bought 10 of their sample packs iirc (got only 5 for some reason), 

tried 3 methods - although made 2 cups together in aeropress, so maybe that affected taste (not sure)

a. black - was ok, nothing too good or bad, more bitter than I wouldve liked, but I think it's because of quantity. It seemed more than what I usually add. \*

b. with milk - great actually. I think this coffee is best for people who want to replace their instant coffee habit. Cause it tastes good with milk (idk about sugar but from a friend it was good) also single serve makes barrier of entry lot easier. 

c. iced (hoffman way) - terrible. way too bitter. I also maybe overextarcted it with higher temperature. definetly not good for iced coffee. Cold coffee with milk and sugar maybe, but iced - NO.

7.5/10 Would like to try and experiment again. 

Problems - I had already listed it to their customer support on whatsapp, received no reply, and yes customer support is itself a problem. It's understandable for new business tho. not sure how to feel about that. 

there isnt even weight mentioned in single serve, I dont understand pricing, website problems etc. 

# 2. KCRoasters -

bought 3 (samples) - red honey, melkodige and purple project during offer. 

a. red honey - decent, i had more expectation because I hadnt tried honey processed before, Couldnt make out taste of jaggery or sweet spice (what even is that lol). overall okish, better with milk little.

b. melkodige - loved it. one of the best ive had. had it black, could make out little toffee-chocolate taste, perfect bitterness low acidic taste. 9/10 would. 

c. purple project - yet to try

gonna try them iced too.

I'm planning on purchasing a Fellow Aiden and wanted some recommendations on a good non-manual grinder to go with it. My main concerns are ease of use and easy maintenance.

I'm mostly brewing with aeropress now using an ezespresso manual grinder. I mostly do either milk based or ""americano"" style long shots. I buy specialty coffe from a local roaster but I'm not an expert and won't spend too much time fiddling with different ratios, coffees or grind settings, I will probably find a setup I like and use it forever haha. I don't intend to brew espresso so no need to support very fine grind settings.

What would you suggest? In terms of price point, I'm happy to pay up to 600 if it's good quality, but obviosly the less the better specially if I'm not going to make use of whatever ""premium"" features it might have. A well built, easy to use grinder that doesn't make a mess is my goal. I do not care about flat or conical burrs as I won't be able to tell probably.

 this is long so bear with me. I mostly want a Christian male perspective but any advice, insight or personal experience is much appreciated 
For background I’m 23, single, mom to a 4yr old, he’s 23 single no kids. 

I have liked this man in my young adult group at church for about a year but before seriously taking interest I wanted to be friends and get to know him. We had a handful of deep conversations about ourselves, along with other friendly interactions and a couple of hangout with other church friends, he’s also met my kid several times and would often ask about him and play with him. 

Around the time I decided I was indeed interested, I fasted for guidance on this & other things. The first night of fasting after prayer, I had a dream of said crush proposing to me, I’ve never had a dream like this before. During the 21 day fast I had about 10 dreams of us dating, talking, hanging out etc. In my head I thought this was confirmation. I knew better than to act on it, I was waiting for him to approach me, I saw a few signs that he may be interested. BUT I started getting really distant with him bc I get super shy when I actually start to like someone and never know what to say around them. So we stopped talking as much, then found out a mutual friend of had liked him before I did. She didn’t know I liked him but I completely stopped talking to him out of respect for her & not wanting to gain more feelings. 

Fast forward 2-3 months, she moved on and started dating someone else. So I was like ok Lord I’m ready to start an intentional friendship again. Sooo after praying for God to confirm if I should take the next step of asking him to hangout, the day after I got 3 undeniable confirmations all within 2 hrs, one of the confirmations included obeying God by blessing a homeless family $100 (which took allot of faith and obedience on my part) and when I asked the father his name to pray for his family he had the same name my crush did. For sure this was confirmation (or so I thought??) anyway so the next day I go up to my crush and let him know I had appreciated him for the impact he has made in my life and to continue doing Gods will because Gods using him to help others, and I added that if he ever wanted to go out to a fruit place or grab a coffee to let me know. He said what I said was confirmation about he’d been praying about and that he’d let me know about meeting up but that hes busy often with traveling (which is true) 

Anyway it’s been about 7 weeks now and he has been completely avoiding me, going out of his way to not talk or look at me. And then randomly last week he liked my Instagram story of a Bible study I host and also found out he was asking my bestfriend at church about me since he hasn’t seen me around. A week later we see eachother at our church’s volleyball game, we’re both at the net in front of eachother and I think he only spoke to me so it wasn’t awkward but he said hey, asked me how I was doing and put his hang out for a low five. I just said “good” barely tapped his hand & didn’t speak another word to him. I wasn’t trying to be rude I simply didn’t expect him to speak to me since he’d been avoiding me and I was also avoiding him. 

Forgive my rambling, thanks for staying this long. But what the heck do I make of this?? And did I technically ask him out? & maybe freaked him out? Could my having a kid be a lot? Did I mistakenly hear God wrong?
Kind over it & letting Gods will be done. I just don’t want to make the same mistakes in the future.
