All that energy seems to have evaporated like yesterday’s coffee. What happened to those days of spontaneity and adventure? 

If you’ve been contemplating your days filled with naps instead of hobbies, you’re not alone. **It’s a tough choice, but it can definitely shape your mindset.** Let’s break it down a bit, shall we?

**Naps:**  
- **Pros:** Refreshing, quick energy booster, perfect for a lazy afternoon.
- **Cons:** Can sometimes leave you feeling groggy—ever wake up thinking it’s time to eat dinner only to realize it’s just 3 PM? 
- **Bottom line:** Great for recovery, but can lead to a repeat cycle of tiredness.

**Hobbies:**  
- **Pros:** Engaging, fulfilling, connects you with your passions. Think painting, gardening, or finally trying that new recipe! 
- **Cons:** It takes a little effort to get started (which could mean saying goodbye to a cozy nap!).
- **Bottom line:** They might take some energy to start, but the long-term boosts in confidence and joy? Totally worth it! 

Maybe we could swap a few *z’s* for that energy that leaves us feeling inspired? Here’s what getting back into hobbies can do for you:

1. **Unlock creativity** - Rediscover an old passion or find a new one. You’d be surprised how much joy something as simple as knitting or photography can bring.
2. **Meet new people** - Ever tried a cooking class or a hiking group? Making connections is as energizing as it gets!
3. **Boost self-esteem** - Completing a project or just spending time on something you love can have a huge impact on how you see yourself.
4. **Purpose matters** - As we age, it’s so easy to feel lost. Hobbies can remind us of our identity outside of work or family responsibilities. 

What’s stopping you from diving back into that hobby you loved? Is it time, energy, or just plain ol’ procrastination? **To be fair, we all know how seductive a comfy blanket and a Netflix binge can be.** 

But think about this: Our purpose and passions can rejuvenate that vitality we often miss. So rather than hitting snooze for the third time, let’s explore that creative spark! 

Oh, and if you want to make those connections even easier, check out this amazing community we found: [We believe in strongest people.](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb) 😉 But I just gotta say, finding strength and wisdom in community is priceless.

Let’s hear from you! What hobbies have you been thinking about? C’mon, let’s get energized together! 🌟",1,1758867235.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1nqtqjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1nqtqjt/35_m4f_bombay_serendipity/,35 [M4F] Bombay - Serendipity,"This is a post about coffee and courage. The courage is the part where two people agree to sit at a table and act like the menu is less confusing than life. The coffee is the part where we get to say “let’s espresso ourselves,” admit it is a terrible pun, then enjoy it anyway because honesty pairs well with caffeine.

I am 35, Mumbai based, steady job, clean habits, curious brain. I like essays, subtitles on, and board games where the real win is people having fun. I am punctual and calm. My laugh sometimes arrives a second late because I think before I react. If your croissant flakes everywhere, I will treat it like weather and not a crime scene.

The plan is simple. We meet at a public cafe with chairs that stay put and a table that does not wobble as a seesaw. We order. You say your drink like it is no big deal, and my brain quietly saves that detail. I will not eat the last bite without asking. If you get an iced drink in a hot month, I respect your climate strategy.

You are kind and curious: aged anywhere between 22 - 122 (Jeanne Calment died at 122). You enjoy the quiet sport of noticing. You can roast my playlist gently, and I will defend one questionable song with lawyer energy. You are fine with pauses that are not awkward, just little loading bars between thoughts. You like jokes that land clean. You think a good date is two people pointing at the same tiny thing and saying look at that. If we both reach for the check, we flip a coin and move on.

I am not here to perform. I am here to pay attention. If the chat flows, we stay. If it is mid, we leave with caffeine and a decent story. Simple, safe, kind. No pressure, just brew honesty.

Logistics are easy. Public cafe, afternoon or early evening. You pick the area, I show up on time. One hour cap unless both want more. Safety first, clear boundaries, easy exit plans.

Say hi with your go to coffee or tea order, one small thing that made you smile this week, and a couple of time slots that work for you.

P.S. I pronounce croissant like a normal person. ",1,1758866956.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

We’ve been working on a little side project called [Next Is On Me](https://nextisonme.com/) — it’s a simple web app where people can create and join casual social events (like grabbing a drink, coffee, or hanging out).

The core philosophy is that Event-Creator pays for the event, (drinks, food, etc) and selects the participant(s), from the list of people applied for it.

Right now, we’ve made it for big cities-only for the first testing phase, since apps like this only work if people in the same city use it.

It’s very much an **MVP** — the basics are there (sign up, make a profile, create/join events), but I’m still improving things like safety reminders and extra features.

If you’re curious, I’d love if you:

* Tried signing up (very simple, no confirmation needed for now),
* Explore events
* Created a small event, or
* Just told us what feels useful / confusing.

All feedback is welcome — positive or critical. We just want to see if this idea is something Berliners would actually find helpful.

Thanks 🙏

*(Mods: if this isn’t allowed, please let me know — happy to take it down.)*",1,1758866916.0,berlinsocialclub,0,1.0,False
1nqtp1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1nqtp1z/its_nice_to_be_nice/,It's nice to be nice,"I started smoking again after 2 years of abstaining. I used to smoke a pack a day and I can't even imagine how I did that, but as I'm getting older I find that 3-4 cigs a day is plenty. I have a stash of nicotine patches and gum but sadly nothing really replaces Marlboro Reds. 

My apartment building has a little smoking area in the parking lot with chairs, a table, and an empty coffee can for butts/ashes. I'm usually only there late at night or early in the morning, and my apartment complex has a lot of older folks. Because the smoking area is right by the dumpsters I often see the older residents dumping garbage and recycling, and they're usually taking out a few days worth of trash.

My appearance is kind of jarring to some of them (female shaved head, tattoos, piercings) but I've won them over because I'm polite and friendly. 
And whenever I see them struggling with big bags of garbage I always jump up and help them with the dumpsters, because the lids are heavy and they also have cumbersome bags to toss. It's nice to help them out, even if they don't ask, because it's so much easier to be nice than it is to sit there and not help.

It takes 10 seconds to heave a bag of trash into the dumpster and a few minutes to chat with them about their day, especially knowing that maybe no one else has talked to them. I don't mind getting garbage juice on my hands if it means talking to them about their cats or kids or favorite TV show, and there's a good chance we have the same favorite show because I like old TV and movies. 

The other day I made brownies for my mom and sister and I had a ton left over, so I wrapped them up in butcher paper and twine and delivered them to some of my older friends in the building. I can't even lie, I kicked my feet and giggled when I got back to my room because they were so happy that someone gave them a treat. 

It's nice to be nice. And it's easy, too. Hold the door open for someone. Compliment their outfit. If someone smiles at you (and they're not being creepy or lecherous) give 'em a smile back. It won't change the whole world but a bit of niceness is always good to have, and give back. ",2,1758866813.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False

Welcome to the Dynastra Empire!","Step into a realm of magic, mystery, and connection, where your original characters (OCs) can thrive in a dynamic world teeming with life. The Dynastra Empire invites you to explore its expansive landscapes, rich cultures, and intricate balance of ancient magic and modern living. Whether your OC is a noble steeped in tradition, a traveling merchant navigating mystical disruptions, or a wandering adventurer with their secrets, there's always a story waiting to unfold.

We have recently made new additions and lore updates, with more on the way as we continue to grow and expand. This includes the newly opened **continent of Veyradon**, a perilous land across the Verdant Sea that holds Azoth’s ruins and the chaos of the Wildlands. With combat roleplay guidelines, bounty boards, and expanded settings now in place, there are more opportunities than ever for your OCs to face danger, uncover secrets, and shape their destinies. When you join, there is a lot of lore and information to read through, so take your time exploring and asking questions as they come!

We are a semi-lit server that prefers 2–3 paragraphs or more. We offer one-on-one roleplays, group roleplays, and 18+ themes, including NSFW and violence. You must be 18 to join.

# What Makes Us Unique? (Lore/Story/In-character)

**A World Alive with Magic** – [https://discord.gg/u6MYU8g9Cu](https://discord.gg/u6MYU8g9Cu)

Dynastra’s magic is woven into its fabric, but it comes with challenges. Your OC could be called to restore balance from arcane decay to dangerous magical outbreaks. Discover the truths behind these phenomena, form pacts with powerful entities, or delve into the mysterious world of pact-breakers who defy magic rules.

**The Frontier of Veyradon**

Across the Verdant Sea lies Veyradon: untamed, perilous, and only half-explored. From Azoth’s cursed jungles to the Wildlands’ chaotic storms, it is a land where survival is never guaranteed. Mercenaries, explorers, and guilds thrive on the **Unified Bounty Board**, where OCs can take on contracts, hunt creatures, and carve their names into legend. Unlike Dynastra, no Pact rules here—only coin, guild law, and grit.

**Community-Driven Events**

Our server thrives on community and storytelling.

* **Enchanting Festivals** – Celebrate life and magic with seasonal gatherings, performances, and culinary delights.
* **Mysterious Missions** – Investigate magical disturbances, unearth ancient artifacts, and confront dangerous creatures. The bounty board and community board provide quests for OCs to expand horizons and meet new people.
* **Elegant Balls & Spirited Gatherings** – Form alliances, ignite rivalries, or enjoy a glass of wine with new friends.
* **Combat Roleplay** – With new guidelines, PvE and PvP combat has opened. From arena duels to Wildlands survival, your OCs can now test their limits in collaborative, high-stakes storytelling.

# A Space for Every Character

* **Build Your World** – Set up your character’s home, shop, or caravan. While channel ownership is limited to approved spaces, every OC can leave its mark on the server’s world.
* **Adapt to Mystery** – From arcane investigators to mercenaries of Veyradon, there’s a role for every personality in this ever-changing magic-scape.
* **All Are Welcome** – Nobles, nomads, seasoned adventurers, and magical creatures alike are embraced here.

# Dynamic Magic, Pacts, and Combat

Magic isn’t just a tool—it’s alive and often unpredictable:

* **Pacts** – Forge agreements with ancient beings, granting your OC unique abilities at a cost. Will your OC honor their pact or walk the dangerous road of a pact-breaker?
* **Magical Outbreaks** – Face the consequences of failing spells and crumbling enchantments.
* **Combat Roleplay** – From arena exhibitions to Wildlands hunts, combat is a narrative tool that shapes stories. Injuries, scars, and even death (with consent) can change your OC forever.
* **Bounty Hunts** – Join Veyradon’s guilds in chasing monsters, fugitives, or relics through Azoth’s ruins and the Wildlands’ chaos.

# Slice-of-Life with Depth

At its heart, Dynastra is a place for everyday moments:

* Relax in the Hot Springs, sip coffee in a quiet café, or enjoy a bustling marketplace.
* Forge meaningful connections—friendship, romance, or rivalry all matter.
* Blend ordinary and epic—from tending a shop to uncovering ancient secrets, every action plays a part in the living world.
* Mounts, Pets, and Races are also a feature within Dynastra. Want a lifelong companion you can roleplay as? Perfect, we have a Mounts/Pets submissions area and welcome new ideas for new creatures within the world, as well as Race submissions to give other creators Ideas for their OC creation!

# Your Story Awaits

Whether your character seeks court intrigue in Dynastra or dangerous glory in Veyradon, this world offers an immersive space where their journey can unfold. With a blend of everyday charm, magical chaos, combat, and endless opportunities for connection, your OC’s story is only just beginning.

# What Makes Us Unique? (OOC, Fun things, bots, and more)

Within Dynastra, there are plenty of other things to do. We have a music bot for our members, Poketwo, as well as an NSFW general chat and category for conversations that may not be suitable for work (SFW). We are not a porn server, but we do encourage creativity in all and welcome open conversations! (You will not have access to these channels until after you introduce yourself.)

Bots included in the server: Tatsu, Poketwo, Maki, Tupperbot (for roleplay and shenanigans), and QOTD Bot (for OC questions).

Fun channels for general conversations: General Chat, Games, IRL pics, Art found, Art created (we have a self-promotion area for active members for art, streaming, and more!), as well as areas for venting and inspirational things.

We also recently opened OC-Prompts, a space where owners post prompts for Members to respond to in character to help scratch those itches between scenes or just to flex those writing muscles. We have OC-Lounges (both SFW and NSFW) for play and non-canon, shorter interactions. (The Lounges welcome any character within them, have a meme tupper? Use it, have a canon character from an anime or show? Play with them there!)

**Current server activity:** We are in a transition period after our summer ball event, as scenes wrap up and new channels open—including the Wildlands, Azoth, and the continent of Veyradon.

1nqtl9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1nqtl9o/year_2_update_our_journey_to_fi/,"Year 2 update, our journey to FI","It’s been two years since we really focused on the FI idea. Previous post in my profile. 40yo each of us.

Last year we reached our first 100,000 invested combined.

We had been very fortunate that things had been going good for us.

Some of the achievements from the last year:

I asked for a raise that it took almost a year in a half to get it, but Im very happy to say that now is a six figure salary. Also I’ve being able to hit the bonuses that I couldn’t the previous years.

The housing market is moving in our area and we found our dream place, that we purchased at the beginning of the year. It was a big milestone in our lives.

Sold our good old 2003 German car (for more than I bought it 8 years ago), was replaced for a 2015 Japanese SUV for her business, paid in cash. I do basic maintenance on it myself.

We keep saving and investing aggressively, avoiding debt at all costs. Our investments had grown despite the big purchases we did.

Frugality is still a big part in our day to day routine, and side gigs whenever the opportunity comes. 

We didn’t upgrade any stuff at the new place and our furniture, bed, and kitchen stuff is close to 8 years. One upgrade we want to do is the mattress.

We hope we can continue in similar situation and push it hard and for the next 5-10 years and that would leave us in a good financial position for the retirement phase.

She helps me to control with the small stuff as I’m tempted by convenience purchases (like daily coffee), and I look after the big ones as she was afraid of investing, purchasing a car, or a place.

Our Morocco trip hasn’t happened yet as we had been swamped with work, but we do mini vacations around our area each month. Summer was really good hitting swimming holes in the area. Next one will be around the Washington coast and next spring maybe New York.

We don’t see ourselves retiring early, but some days I wish I could retire already hahaha!",5,1758866448.0,financialindependence,0,1.0,False
1nqtkor,https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1nqtkor/ac_mirage_my_thoughts_pros_cons/,AC Mirage: My thoughts + pros & cons,"Pros:

* Historical Realism: I live in the Middle East and Bagdahd feels very historically accurate. Aside from the markets and coffee house, the mosques and call to prayer really boosts the realism. I recommend setting the voice language to Arabic for extra immersion.
* Parkour: In all the AC games I've played, I've never felt a truer sense of 360 parkour. I frequently find myself on sprints that feel deliberately crafted that continue on even when I diverge off course.
* Environmental Stealth: Since Syndicate and Black Flag, we haven't had environmental stealth features like 'pull-something-down-to-obstruct' or 'hire-thugs-to-distract' or 'hire-people-to-walk-around-with'. Their return in Mirage make for a more stealthy experience.\\
* Cool Fatal Blows: When you attack after parry, you usually do a sweet fatal-blow animation. Nice touch.

Cons:

* Brutes: The brutes are simply overpowered. Their red attacks are all too common, they are weirdly fast, and can heal. They're essentially mini-bosses that become a nuisance.
* Parkour still isn't fluid: One of our champagne problems is that when we're running a parkour course, the character often hesitates before taking the most obvious route. Even jumping down from things takes lots of encouragement before taking an awkward fall.
* Notoriety: I love the noteriety feature cuz it controls the behaviour of NPCs (enemies AND civilians) and encourages you to take detours to tear down wanted posters. However, the variable doesn't make you ""wanted"" like it does in, say, RDR2, where your notoriety influences the appearance of patrols and bounty hunters. This added threat could turn a pull into a push, but that's just me.",1,1758866395.0,assassinscreed,0,1.0,False

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

You can also do the same thing elsewhere! If you're feeling lost or need direction, an easy next step could be to find barista jobs at local cafes or competitor chains. 

I really enjoyed my time at a local cafe during a brief break from the siren. It allowed me to really hone my coffee knowledge and skills (and even traditional matcha preparation which was very cool). I unfortunately did find the pay and benefits could be worse (that's how I made my way back lol). If you're in the right position, it could be the right step for you! 

Again, I'm sorry to anyone struggling right now. It isn't right and it isn't fair. There's so much out there ""bigger and better"" than Starbucks though, so I wouldn't worry more than you need to.",8,1758865978.0,starbucks,0,0.9,False

I was swamped with work, stressing over a dadline, and honestly, I hadn't even managed to drag myself out of my pj's until midday. 😂 The week felt like it was already slipping through my finegrs. 

Out of nowhere, my boyfriend shows up at my door with this big smile and that mischievous twinkle in his eye. He's not usually one to make grand gestures, so I was kinda curious. He'd taekn the day off wtihout telling me and decided he was gonna be my personal assistant for the day. 

While I was drowning in emalis and spreadsheets, he just quietly did all the household stuff I had planned to tackle later. He even straightened up my workspace (which is usulaly a warzone, tbh) and borught me my fqvorite iced coffee just the way I like it. 

And this was when I knew he wasn't just doing it to be nice—it was like he wanted to lift this weight off my sholders just because he cared. By the time evening rolled around, and I had actually met my deadline ahead of time (such a miracle!), we celebrated with a homemade dinner he whippped up himself. 

I'm honestly still in awe... it was such a simple thing, but just knowing he was tere for me, making my day bettr without me even asking, was the sweetest thing in the world.

compared to other roasters, i found this coffee hugely lacking depth and flavour.  
questions i have:

1. the packing date was from 3 months bfor, still how did i get so much crema?  
2.  Can you rate the flow of this shot? I would give it abt a 7, looks a little fast at least for me  
3. The beans were quite small in size, does that mean inferior quality?  
4. There was a lot of roasting inconsistency, as in it is supposed to be a dark roast but id say almost 2-3% of the beans where a very pale brown, more yellowish- does this affect taste  
5. Ive heard that dark roasts shud be taking a lesser extraction time, but is this ok?

6. Is this blend better for milk based or espresso or brewed black coffee



My review - I would not reccomend it to anyone who has already tried better roasters, may it be hunkal, BT or devans, etc. I found it quite monotonous, maybe a little harsh, and quite disappointing.

He’s a pretty good sleeper but with all the nose juice he’s been waking himself up a bit earlier all week. I take the early shift, usually from 530 but this week around 5 - those 30 mins make a huge difference. This morning it was 415 and I just couldn’t.

I came down to relieve the troops to, “he’s so tired, but won’t sleep. And he’s got 100ml of his bottle left, which he won’t finish.”
Let me tell ya, the lady is asleep upstairs, the bottle is empty, the boy is asleep on my chest for a tactical pre nursery 45 minute nap, and the dog (5M, Scottish Terrier) just came and snuggled in and passed out next to me.

1nqte6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1nqte6e/about_the_coffee_table_2022/,"About ""The Coffee Table"" (2022)","I wanted to see my dad's reaction to this movie, so we sat down to watch it and asked for his opinion afterward. Apparently the main hangup he had was that it wasn't clear whether Jesus killed the baby on purpose or not. In my mind it was unambiguous, that it must've been an accident. 

Went online to see some opinions and I kept seeing the same sentiment over and over, with some even saying there was no other way to see it than Jesus slamming the baby down with all of his strength.
To me it was obvious for a few reasons:
1) You can hear the squeak of his shoes from his feet slipping. While it is hard to imagine the logistics of the accident, I believe he was a bit further away from the table since his feet arent on carpet, it's possible he fell with his arms stretched out and broke the glass that way while Cayetano was falling. If he threw the baby or slammed it, I dont think he would've injured his hand so much.
2) He was distraught and in shock the entire film. Was he 100% ready to be a father? Not really, but you could tell from the way he was cooing him and even changed his diaper after the incident that he loved the kid. He gave no indication that he was hostile to Cayetano at all, minus the name but hey it happens. I've never liked my sister's name but I still love her to bits lol. Would he really kill the son he gave the same toys he grew up with?
3) He wanted to off himself for it, even stating in the video that it was a stupid accident he couldn't own up to. A few comments from parents shared the sentiment that their will to live would plummet if they were in the same situation, that it was their worst fear made manifest.

You could argue that it was a psychotic manic moment of frustration as the brother mentioned Jesus had suffered paranoid episodes in the past, or that he didnt care about his son because he didn't rank him #1 on his list, or that he only wanted to kill himself because of the law/Maria's reaction (not because of the infanticide), but I think that's a little contrived. The story doesn't need that unnecessary edginess on top of what it's already portraying. In fact I believe it's more compelling if it's an accident, as the horror is more relatable that way. It's more feasible than a rage induced mental snap lapse in judgement, to me at least.

Pretty cool that people got different things out of it though, like the theory that Maria subconsciously knew all along. Never even considered that. What are your thoughts?",1,1758865713.0,horror,2,1.0,False

# Hey guys! Made these as a thank you to my tattoo artist and wanted to have enough leftover. Each batch is for 24 muffins. I use turbinado sugar on top as well.

(Also includes vague spoilers for Canto 6 if you're a new player)


Yi Sang:

Yi Sang, you still long for the past that is no longer within your reach... But I can see that you're also fluttering your wings to move forward.

Ah... I can feel your thoughts, Yi Sang. This is... huh? An intense love for mint flavored coffee...?



Faust:

Faust, you're... agh, so many thoughts... I'm feeling dizzy.



Don: 

Your indefatigable will, Don Quixote, reminds me of a certain Operator back at Rhodes Island.



Ryoshu:

Whoa... you abbreviate your thoughts into acronyms too, Ryōshū? I don't get it... But I'll be able to parse them one day, right?



Meursault:

Meursault, your thoughts are so... hard to explain. So your only wish is to accept?



Hong Lu:

Hong Lu, your heart is vast like a great river... It's so kind, even as it rushes onward... it flows, but it doesn't flood.



Heathcliff:

Heathcliff, I know you're frustrated, but please don't roll up your sleeves to punch your coworkers...!

I can feel that your heart swells with love, but... for whom? I don't know...



Ishmael:

You always try to meticulously plan around various situations, Ishmael.

Your adventurous spirit of a sailor shines through from time to time, Ishmael. And it makes my heart rush, too.



Rodya:

Rodya, let's try to save dinner thoughts until after the mission!

Rodya, your heart is like... cold ice, from time to time.



Sinclair:

Sinclair, this sadness you're carrying... I believe it'll become a strength that will push you further forward.



Outis:

Outis, you care for the Manager like I care for Doctor.

Agh... Outis, what... what are these emotions, these memories...?



Gregor:

It might look like you're doing things in half-measure, Gregor, but you're more serious than anyone when you really get to it!

Gregor... You've been carrying so much sadness, so many painful memories... You lived a hard life.




Apparently Yi Sang loves mint coffee for some reason, a man after me own heart. And I wonder if Amiya's shocked at what Outis has done... or if she's shocked in general about memories of the Smoke War? Her reaction to seeing Gregor's Smoke War memories isn't as dramatic.",92,1758865425.0,limbuscompany,25,0.99,False

RedotPay is the first thing that’s felt seamless. You can load BTC, ETH, or stablecoins and just use it like a normal debit card. I even set up the virtual card for online subscriptions like Spotify and Adobe, and it worked fine.

In the UK, this could be really useful. You could tap it for the Tube, pay for groceries at Tesco, grab a coffee at Pret, or cover online bills without converting to GBP through an exchange every time. 

The fees aren’t perfect for small spends, but compared to the usual hoops, it’s a much smoother way to actually use crypto day-to-day.

1nqt1za,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1nqt1za/i_wrote_this_response_to_another_question/,I wrote this response to another question,"I'd wonder what sort of environment and situation you're in. You know the old saying, ""man is a product of his environment."" As a long term traveler, it's easy to notice how different places have an overall effect on thoughts, feelings, desires, practices etc. 

I've replaced all social media scrolling with meditation. Deleted instagram and facebook regardless of who I thought was on there and I wouldn't be able to be in contact with. Also next to zero porn (once every 2 or 3 weeks)... but I continue to resist and know that soon it won't be a thing at all. 

Walking barefoot in nature and stopping to touch, hold or hug certain tree... I believe helps... I think I can feel the energy. Gratitude journal first thing after meditation in the morning. Practicing the ""Loving All Method"" that I learned in ""The direct means to eternal bliss - Michael Langford.""

Building playlists of music I really enjoy dancing and listening to. Acquire very good earbuds or headphones for best sound quality (makes such a difference).   
  
Writing my thoughts down and coaching myself 24-7.   
Positive reframing all things... there's always something good that comes about through difficult or uncomfortable experiences (which are usually just thoughts about things).

Realising that happiness is possible despite not yet being ""awakened, enlightened, Self realised"" which helps one relax. No rush. This is already magic. Being human is magic. We get to walk, talk, feel, taste, touch, love, sing, laugh, think etc.

Notice when the thoughts rev up and just come back to sitting in the chair, heart beating, lungs breathing, thoughts thinking... how heavy it feels sitting on the chair. SMILE! Simply smiling for no reason helps. Smile :) 

Realise everyone is going through something similar, maybe worse, more difficult, scary, sad... It's actually all good. There's nothing wrong right here, right now... it's actually beautiful! Super beautiful. Sometimes I feel that I could cry it's so beautiful and lovely. 

This is life... it's amazing. Incredible!

Read lots of good books on achieving happiness and contemplate the teaching. Share what you learn...

I met a beautiful woman sitting by the mall and we went walking together then met for coffee this morning. When saying good bye she said ""You have such a beautiful aura."" I've heard this sort of thing a few times from people and I still have my own thoughts about myself (my own perspective).

Try to think positively about yourself. Be kind to yourself coz you are human and you deserve it and it will help others ( you'll be in a good mood and able to uplift others).

Notice patterns in moods from wearing different coloured clothing. I only noticed this this morning but every time I wear this pink shirt I start thinking kind and loving thoughts about myself. I also like the way I look. Usually I don't care much about what I'm wearing but I'm going to take a bit more time find what puts me into a better mood. 

Letting go... trusting life to do what it needs to, to get you all the things you need. It always does. It always has and it will continue to. ;) Smile

Hugs also help ;) haha it's energy. Loving others is loving yourself

Meditation is a whole lifestyle thing (for me).... realising that the world is largely a distraction from this moment right here and now. Social media, news etc is pulling your attention away from you! From connecting with others, from really living and loving, laughing, being silly, having fun.

I am 40, single, don't have anyone depending on me, self employed so it's possibly different but still... the meditation mindset should have a positive effect on your overall well being. 

Life is supporting you and will continue to! It's not all dependent on you and your abilities... it's lifes abilities. 

Things are usually wrong only in your mind and imagination... when you see that, surrender, breath... take a big deep breath and let go of all the tension in your neck, back, shoulders, back, legs, hands... just let go 

Your life is an adventure and an experience! An epic one at that ;) You're going to see, feel, experience all kinds of amazing things

At the same time, remember that meditation is a proven practice for well being and a foundation for wholesome and happy living. 

If we have 16 waking hours, surely we can dedicate at least 1 of those to meditation, 1 to exercise, study, nutrition (important to never eat or drink bad stuff). Its a long life, build good habits and discipline to carry you through till the end. I learned that from Tony Robbins (continual and never ending improvements).

Naa koy Indian classmate sa among English class, then first day pa lang jud sa klase, I thought he was cute. Cute-an ra jud ko niya, mao ra. Sometimes I also get attracted to other Indian guys, pero since I’m really sensitive to smell, I don’t like getting too close kay naay uban nga medyo strong ilang smell (no offense, not all ha). Maybe it’s because of my past encounters back in The Philippines, kay mag sakit jud ako ulo usahay basta masugatan nako sila. 

Unexpectedly, na-partner nako siya sa class activity ug didto mi nag-ila-ila. And guess what, he doesn’t smell at all. He also dresses well, ang height niya kay around 5’9, puti kaayo’g ngipon, and limpyo kaayo siya tanawon. So, nagsabot mi unsa among i-present sa class, pero I found it somewhat difficult to communicate with him since English is not our first language (pero basin magkasinabot ra jud mi if love jud namo ang usag-usa, charot!!). Somehow, we presented really well sa class. Then, he asked me kung asa ko nag-buy ug book para sa English class. I taught him, unya I even offered nga pwede nako siya ubanan mag-buy kay akong next class kay duol ra sa bookstore. Ning ingon siya ug “okay,” so I thought ni-agree siya nga ubanan nako siya ngadto sa bookstore. Mao to nagdali-dali ko og hipos sa akong gamit, pero na-shock ko sa iyang giingon:

Him: “Let me go?”

Me: “What do you mean?” (naglibog gyud ko)

Him: “Let me go, ok?”

Me: “Gi-ahak…” (wa nako kasabot pero murag mo-lakaw na siya)

Him: “What?”

Me: “Oh… I said okay. Bye.”

Him: “Bye.”

gi ahak uy nagkatawa ko sa let me go moment hahah naglibog ko, so ambot, nakapangalot na lang ko sa akong bugan. 

Taga klase, kasagaran jud kami duha ang maabot una sa classroom (btw, naa pud siya’y pagka-misteryoso or hilomon ra jud siya). Tapos ni-greet siya nako, “Hi, how are you?” unya mao na nagsugod ang among small talk. Then, nagka-partner nasad mi sa class activity (pwede IRL na pud mag-partner? haha joke). Sige ra siya ug ngisi nako, hahaha, ambot di na ko ka-focus (nindot kay siya’g ngipon jud). Naa koy gipakita niya sa akong gisulat, mao to nga ning-duol siya, duol kaayo iyang nawong sa akong nawong! jusmiyo ayaw kol! 

Him: “Sorry… am I too close?” (smiling)

Me: “Nah, it’s okay.” 

(*plays imahinasyon by TJ Monterde beh hahahaah)

Fast forward, sige jud nako siya masugatan sa campus before or after class (ga-solo ra siya permi bisan mag-lunch). Kagahapon, na-meet nako siya sa café unexpectedly. Nag-linya siya sa cashier, unya ni-greet siya nako:

Him: “Are you going to eat lunch?”

Me: “Nah, just gonna buy some snacks.”

Him: “Ohh, okay. Btw, do you like coffee? I can treat you one.”

Me: “Oh, really? Sure, thank you!”

(Pero honestly, di jud ko ga-drink ug coffee sa school kay kalibangon man gud ko basta mo-inom ko coffee, and di ko gusto malibang sa school huhu… pero gi-accept jud nako, hahaha.)

So, gi-treat jud ko niya ug coffee, and while naghulat mi sa cashier, nag-small talk lang mi about class ug random stuff. I noticed nga every time siya mo-smile, murag dali ra kaayo ko ma-distract. Pag-abot sa coffee, gi-hand niya personally sa ako, “Here, for you.” Grabe, close kaayo siya, mura kog ma-heart attack gamay. Hahaha! Pero kay di man ko ga-drink ug coffee sa school (kalibangon bitaw ko), gi-hold lang nako ang cup. Unya murag awkward gamay kay nagtan-away mi, tapos ako, lowkey nag-pangalot sa akong bugan while nag-smile lang. Hahaha, grabe bitaw, wala ko kabalo unsaon pag-react, pero I survived! 

Pag-uli nako, bit-bit gihapon nako ang coffee bisan nabugnaw na, gi-inom gihapon nako…unya gilibang rapud nako! Hahaha! Bitaw, gi-utong jud ang kakilig sa CR uy! Mao to, pahungaw ra ko. Ugma klase napud, magkita nasad mi ani sa klase kung di siya mo-absent!",2,1758864296.0,pahungaw,4,1.0,False

I went to ENTs, urgent cares, tried everything — wedge pillows, Tums, Pepcid, cutting out coffee, tomatoes, greasy food, natural herbs… nothing worked.

At the same time, I was staying a few nights a week at my sister’s house. You couldn’t see mold, but you could definitely smell it. After a while, I started feeling terrible — weak, congested, and inflamed.

That’s when it clicked: what if this isn’t true LPR at all, but a reaction to the mold? I brushed it off at first because my sister and her boyfriend seemed fine living there full-time.

Fast forward two months after I stopped staying there — all my “LPR” symptoms are gone. I can eat whatever I want, drink alcohol, lie down after meals, and my throat feels completely normal. I am so THANKFUL.

After researching, I learned mold exposure can mimic GERD and LPR. Mold spores can inflame the throat, esophagus, and airways, making it feel exactly like reflux. Some people tolerate toxins better than others, but it’s not safe long-term.

I truly believe mold was the cause. If you’re struggling with “LPR” that doesn’t respond to meds or diet, don’t forget to look at your environment — sometimes it’s not acid, it’s the air you’re breathing.",1,1758863896.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

She will propose a time to meet, then last minute decide to push the time back 30 minutes because she knows she won't make it, then inevitably be another 15-45 minutes late from that time. Then we will talk for 2 hours, and then I will have to wait while she goes to the bathroom fixes her makeup before we leave. 

When all is said and done, it will be a 3 or 4 hour affair. To make matters worse, she is a nocturnal person who doesn't start her day till 1:30pm, so by the time I get out of coffee it will be evening. 

I want to lie to her and tell her that my husband wants to have brunch at 2pm. I need to justify meeting earlier to leave buffer space for all the nonsense, and have an out to avoid getting out of coffee when it is nearly time for dinner. AITAH if I do that?",4,1758863857.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

I just loaded USDT, converted enough for daily expenses, and used the card everywhere Visa/Mastercard worked—coffee, metro, snacks, no problem. Didn’t have to stress about ATM fees or bad exchange rates.

It made me think how much better this setup would be if more services allowed you to load **Bitcoin** directly. 

Instead of just holding BTC as “digital gold,” you could actually use it for day-to-day travel expenses. For me, that feels like the next step in making Bitcoin practical.

1nqsu50,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1nqsu50/mold_gerd/,Mold & GERD,"Out of nowhere, I started getting scary symptoms — chest pain that radiated down my left arm, vagus nerve pain, throat pain, burning in my stomach and esophagus. I went to ENTs, urgent cares, tried herbs, wedge pillows, Tums, Pepcid, cut out tomatoes and coffee… nothing helped.

At the time, I was staying at my sister’s house a few days a week. You couldn’t see mold there, but you could definitely smell it. After a while, I felt awful — sinus pain, weakness, and eventually it even hurt just to breathe.

That’s when it clicked: what if this is from the mold? I doubted it at first because my sister and her boyfriend live there full time and seem fine.

Fast forward two months after I stopped staying there — my “GERD” is completely gone. I can eat whatever, drink whatever, even lie flat after greasy food, and I’m totally fine.

Turns out mold can absolutely mimic GERD/reflux/esophagitis. Spores can irritate your throat, esophagus, and stomach lining so it feels exactly like acid reflux. Some people handle toxins better than others, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe.

I’m convinced mold was the cause of my problems. If you’re struggling with reflux that doesn’t respond to meds or diet changes, check your environment too — sometimes it’s not your stomach, it’s the air you’re breathing.",5,1758863695.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1nqsnhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nqsnhr/my_25f_friend_25f_went_on_a_date_with_a_creepy/,My (25F) friend (25F) went on a date with a creepy guy who turned out to be my coworker (28M),"At my job, I work on a small team. We all get along well, and our workplace is also pretty relaxed so it's easy to socialize. We regularly eat lunch or dinner as a group, and a couple of us will usually go out for drinks every Friday or so. Things have been great so far.

About three months ago, Jake (28M, fake name) joined our team. I wouldn’t say we’re super close, not a lot of interests in common and all that, though he’s been friendly and easy to get along with. A bit quiet sometimes and keeps to himself, but he always comes with us on team socials. He does his work on time, and overall just seemed like a nice, normal guy. 

That changed last weekend, when I was grabbing coffee with my friend Maya (25F, also fake name). We used to be college roommates, and even though we're not as close now, we still try to catch up at least once a month. While we were chatting, Maya mentioned a recent date she'd been on really freaked her out. I knew she'd been using the apps for a while and had her fair share of first date horror stories, but she said that this one had been way worse than usual. 

Maya had matched with this guy on Tinder who insisted on meeting at a bar for their first date. He also insisted on buying her drinks, which wasn't that weird at first, but then he started ordering shots (wtf) like an hour into the date and kept pressuring her to drink even after she said no. At the end of the night, he invited her back to his place, and when she declined, he got upset and started drunkenly ranting about how “all women are gold diggers” and how she shouldn’t have let him buy her drinks if she wasn’t planning to sleep with him.

When Maya got up to leave, he also stood up and kept ranting while following her out. At this point, Maya said she was genuinely afraid he might try to follow her home (her apartment was within walking distance of the bar), so she ended up staying and calling a friend to come pick her up.  

I was horrified, but figured it was just a story about some random creep from a dating app, until Maya showed me the guy's profile. It was Jake. 

I didn't say anything to Maya at the time, and I don't think she knows either. But I'm almost 100% sure the guy she went on a date with is my coworker. Besides the name, I also recognized Jake from the pictures on his profile. There's even one where he's posing with his dog, which is the same dog I've seen on his phone lock screen. Other things matched up too, like his job description (didn't mention the company by name, but the summary he gave Maya matches what we do) and family details (only child, family not in town, etc.). 

Now, I feel like I'm seeing Jake in a completely different light and I don't know what to do. Sexist comments aside, his other behaviors like pressuring Maya to drink and almost following her home are major red flags. So far, he's done nothing inappropriate at work (that I know of). But I keep thinking about how easily something similar to the other women on our team, especially since so many of our team socials are in casual settings with alcohol involved. 

I want to go to HR or talk to my manager, but I'm not sure how helpful that will be since this date happened outside of work, and Maya isn’t connected to my job. Again, Jake hasn’t done anything *at work* that I can point to. I’m worried that if I say something, even just as a warning to my female coworkers, it'll get back to Jake and I'd be accused of starting drama or spreading rumors without proof. 

I’ve also considered suggesting we scale back the drinking at our socials, but no one else seems to have a problem with the alcohol, and I don't want to raise questions about why I'm making a fuss out of the blue like this. 

I feel stuck. I want to make sure the people I work with are safe, but I also don’t want to jeopardize my job or reputation if I speak up without “proof.” I don't know if I'm overreacting, since Jake has been fine so far. How do I navigate this? 

Tl;dr - A close friend, Maya, went on a date with a guy who kept pressuring her to drink, made misogynistic comments, and almost followed her home. Turns out the guy is my new coworker, Jake, who's been friendly and caused no problems so far. I'm worried for my female coworkers since Jake attends a lot of our socials where alcohol is present (though nothing has happened yet), but also I don't know if I have enough evidence to bring this to HR or my manager.

1nqse0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/videoeditinghints/comments/1nqse0b/how_to_start_manage_your_youtube_channel/,How to Start & Manage Your YouTube Channel,"# 

So, you want to start a YouTube channel. Cool. You know what else I wanted once? A bonsai tree. You water it every day, trim it with love, nurture it... and then it dies in three weeks because you forgot to check if it needed sunlight.

Running a YouTube channel is the same. It starts off exciting, looks easy from the outside, but turns out to be a cocktail of tech, creativity, consistency, and (surprise!) strategy.

Here’s everything I wish someone had told me before I uploaded my first video with shaky audio, off-centered framing, and an existential crisis in the background.

# Start Where You Are

Let’s kill the myth: you don’t need a RED camera, perfect lighting, or a studio setup to start. I began with a five-year-old smartphone, a cheap clip-on mic, and daylight from the kitchen window.

When people ask me how to make a YouTube video, that’s honestly where I tell them to begin – not with gear, but with *doing*. Your first videos won’t look great. That’s not just okay – that’s the point.

You’ll learn faster by publishing than by researching endlessly. I promise, your fifth video will already make you cringe at your first. That’s progress.

And for editing? I started with free tools like Shotcut and later experimented with DaVinci Resolve, which is powerful but a bit overkill for quick projects. I also tried CapCut — great for speed, but not ideal for more complex timelines. Eventually, I settled on Movavi Video Editor because it hits the sweet spot between “I don’t want to die setting keyframes” and “please give me features that don’t look like Windows XP.”

# Your Channel Is Not About You (Wait, What?)

Harsh truth: unless you're famous, no one cares about your daily routine or why you love coffee at 3am. Your audience comes for value – whether that’s entertainment, education, or some hybrid niche like “comedic baking tutorials while ranting about Excel.”

I made the mistake early on of talking too much before delivering the hook. One day, a random comment read: *“Skip to 3:20 if you want to avoid the TED Talk.”* Ouch, but fair.

Now, I structure every video like this:

* **Intro (under 15 seconds):** Set expectations.
* **Main content:** Solve their problem or deliver the story.
* **Optional extras:** Bloopers, context, or side-stories.
* **CTA (call to action):** “Subscribe,” “Try this,” or “What would you do differently?”

Keep it tight. You’re not writing an Oscar monologue.

# Content Strategy Without Crying

Early on, I thought I’d wing it. I’d post “when I felt inspired.” Spoiler: inspiration took a six-month sabbatical.

Now I treat content planning like meal-prepping. You batch. You mix. You reuse.

Here’s the system that keeps me sane:

* **Buckets:** I use three content types – “how-to”, “behind-the-scenes”, and “opinion”. Rotate weekly.
* **Ideas dump:** Every shower thought goes into a Google Keep note.
* **Scripts:** Half-scripted, half-bulleted. I never read line by line (sounds robotic), but I also don’t trust my brain to remember everything.

**Hot tip:** Film more than one video in one sitting. Change your shirt. Boom – two weeks of content.

# Gear Talk – The Truth About “Upgrades”

Let’s talk tech – but without the pressure. You don’t need a studio setup or a camera rig that looks like it belongs on a Marvel set. I started with a dusty phone, a $20 lav mic, and a ring light I bought with grocery change. And guess what? That was enough.

# 🔊 Audio > Everything Else

Audio is the dealbreaker. No one sticks around for great visuals with garbage sound. I used my phone mic at first – it picked up more fridge hum than voice. My first “real” upgrade was a wired lav mic. Game-changer. These days I switch between that and a Rode mic, depending on whether I’m at my desk or hiding in a closet for cleaner audio.

Pro tip: test your space. Clap. If it echoes, throw in blankets, curtains, couch cushions – whatever deadens the sound. Your laundry pile works just as well as acoustic panels.

# 💡 Lighting Doesn’t Have to Be Fancy

For months, I used sunlight through a shower curtain. It worked until winter hit and everything looked like it was shot in a cave. A $30 ring light fixed that. I still use it, paired with two clamp lights DIY’d with parchment paper. Point is: learn to manipulate light before throwing money at it. Side angles, shadows, bounce – all add character and depth.

# 🎥 Framing Is the Free Upgrade

The **rule of thirds** changed everything. Instead of centering myself like a mugshot, I started shifting to one side, adding props or text to the empty space. My videos instantly felt more intentional. I also shoot wide now and crop in post – gives me room to play with motion and reframing later.

# ✂️ Editing – Keep It Flowing

I tried a few editors — some were too basic, others felt like they needed a pilot’s license. Adobe Premiere Pro was powerful but slow and overwhelming. Final Cut Pro X was smoother, especially with smart reframing and audio cleanup, but still felt like overkill for most projects.

For complex timelines, both tools offer AI-assisted features like auto color matching and audio tools. Premiere even integrates with After Effects for tasks like object removal. Powerful, sure – but for regular content, I want something that gets me from timeline to upload without digging through manuals.

That’s where Movavi Video Editor came in. It’s fast, intuitive, and doesn’t hit me with error codes every time I breathe wrong. I can sync audio by eye, trim quickly, and throw in motion text or color tweaks without losing flow – perfect for staying consistent.

If you’re wondering how to make a good YouTube video, this is where it starts: clean editing that supports your message. Fancy transitions won’t save a boring script. Keep it sharp, keep it honest, let your personality do the rest.

Final tip? Don’t get stuck in the gear loop. Upgrade when you hit a real wall – not because a YouTuber swears a Sigma lens will fix everything. What matters more is how well you use what you’ve already got.

# Posting Schedule: The Myth of the Algorithm God

Consistency matters more than frequency.

I post once a week. That’s all I can handle between client gigs and real life. And you know what? That’s fine. The YouTube algorithm isn’t a deity who smites you for missing a Tuesday.

Instead, focus on being predictably present.

**Hack:** Pre-schedule your uploads. I block out one Sunday a month for batch-filming and editing. Then I can go back to being a semi-functioning adult while my videos publish on autopilot.

# Analytics – But Make It Mental-Health-Friendly

Do NOT check your video performance every 20 minutes.

Analytics are helpful *if* you treat them as feedback, not judgment.

I check three things:

* **Click-through rate (CTR)**: Are my titles/thumbnails working?
* **Audience retention**: Where do people drop off?
* **Comments**: Any recurring questions or praise I can repurpose?

You’ll have videos that flop. It happens. Some of my best work got 112 views. Some random experiment hit 20K in a week. There’s no formula, only patterns.

# Monetization: The Game Within the Game

Here’s the line everyone wants to know: *how long does a YouTube video have to be to make money?*

Technically? Any length can make money through affiliate links or brand deals.

But if we’re talking YouTube Partner Program, the magic numbers are:

* 1,000 subscribers
* 4,000 watch hours over the last 12 months

Longer videos tend to help with watch time – but don’t stretch content just to hit 10 minutes. That’s like putting lettuce on a hot dog and calling it a salad.

Real talk: My first monetized check was $132. Not life-changing. But it was real. From there, you scale – via digital products, Patreon, consulting, you name it.

# Community Building – AKA Don’t Be a Robot

People don’t follow content. They follow creators.

Respond to comments. Ask your viewers what they want next. Shout out regulars. Don’t outsource your soul to AI-generated captions and call it a day.

What worked well for me:

* Adding polls to the Community tab.
* Asking questions at the end of videos (“What’s your go-to editing hack?”).
* Making viewers part of the process (“Which thumbnail looks better?”).

Over time, I went from “guy talking to the void” to “creator with a tiny but loud crew.”

# Burnout & Boundaries: A Pep Talk

At one point, I tried to upload 3x per week. My sleep hated me. My social life ghosted me. I stopped enjoying editing.

If you’re not careful, YouTube will eat your joy.

So I made a list:

* Why I started
* What “success” means (for me)
* What I’m not willing to sacrifice

Now, when I feel the pressure creeping in, I re-read it.

**Remember:** YouTube is a long game. Not a sprint.

# Let’s Wrap

If you scrolled this far, you’re probably not just “thinking about starting” a channel. You’re ready to do it – or at least ready to stop overthinking it.

So here’s your real checklist:

* Make your first video. Not your best – your first.
* Pick an editing tool you actually enjoy.
* Choose a posting schedule you can *realistically* stick to.
* Talk to your viewers like humans.
* Use metrics to grow, not to hate yourself.

And hey, don’t forget – your early content is not a reflection of your potential. It’s just your starting point. 🎬

Now your turn – if you’ve already launched a channel, what was your biggest “a-ha” moment? And if not – what’s stopping you?

**Preparing for My First Date Ever in Australia: What Should I Do, Say, and Wear?**



Hi, I’m 22 and recently asked a girl out on a date—she said yes! This is my first date ever. She’s the first girl I’ve asked out, and I’m thrilled she agreed. I’m a bit of a nerd—an engineering student—while she’s more of a social butterfly.

I have a few questions to help make sure the date goes well:

Setting: I thought she was a chill person, so I invited her for a casual hangout instead of a formal date. We’re meeting at a shopping complex with nice coffee shops, eateries, and a nearby park.

Clothing: Since it’s casual, I’m unsure what to wear. I’ve noticed I look best in a full shirt and pants, but I’m worried that might seem too formal.

Flowers: Should I bring a flower? I’m not sure what’s appropriate in Australia.

Physical affection: What kind of greeting is best—handshake, side hug, chest hug? Also, if the date goes really well, what if she expects a kiss? I’m not very comfortable with that, but I think she’s not very reserved and might expect it.

Communication: This is my biggest concern. English isn’t my first language, but it’s hers. Should I practice speaking by talking to myself beforehand?

Ending the date: Should I ask for a second date before the first one ends, especially if I think she prefers someone who initiates? Or should I let her decide? Also, how do I respectfully end the date—who should take the lead?

Do-nots: Are there any topics I should avoid completely?

Thanks! I’m open to feedback and criticism.

**CashenJ**

Don't over think it bro. Go grab some lunch, have a coffee, ask her about her interests, listen to her, don't talk about yourself too much, wear what you're comfortable wearing. Be as affectionate as you feel comfortable being. No flowers though, that's a bit odd, especially given the date setting. Be yourself, enjoy your date.

**Few\_Interactions\_**

*Great advice!*

*To add: being casual Where tshirt or button down shirt and jeans and shoes(not trainers). Make sure shoes are clean and shirts ironed. I tend to switch between my RM Williams or Lacoste white shoes*

*Definitely not flowers!*

*Compliment her when you meet! Say, You look nice in that Go in and give a peck on cheek when you meet, don’t shake hands or stand around awkward and say like Hi*

*Be confident and be yourself and have fun. Girls love a confident guy who seems fun to be around*

*It’s first date so don’t expect much, and try to end with a kiss. Keep it low key. This date is getting to know each other and seeing if you’re both compatible. There’s no rush*

*GL, Keep us updated on how it goes*

**Vegemite\_kimchi**

Dress casual - you will look out of place in a shopping centre otherwise. Definitely no flowers on a first date. Hugging as a greeting is very normal, even between friends, so it won't seem out of place. Don't kiss if you don't feel comfortable - I personally think it's a bit too forward, and you don't even know if she sees you that way yet - what if the date makes her realise she sees you more as a friend, and then you try and kiss her? No physical affection until you know the feelings are reciprocated.

>OOP: What does dressing casually mean idk, I don't know. I look terrible in t-shirts, jeans, and shorts, as my dressing sense is shit sf

**Vegemite\_kimchi**

*Chino pants, tshirt, closed shoes :) If you're unsure, go to the venue a few days before and see what other couples are wearing.*

>

*Good move. Go for a walk, grab a bite, chat and just hang out. First date should be casual*

>

*Wear your normal clothes, just look ""clean"" and well-groomed in them.*

>

*No. Don't bring anything ""romantic"" but if it seems right at the time feel free to buy something on the date. EDIT: Actually don't, you're just going to the shops. This is more if you are going to an event or something unique*

>

*Don't shake hands. Try to mirror what she goes for at the start. She might be a hugger, she might not be. One thing that is important is consent, if you feel like a kiss is building ask ""can I kiss you?""*

>

*You can do that if it will make you less nervous but I don't think it's necessary. If she says anything you don't understand, or if she doesn't seem to understand something you're saying, don't feel embarrassed. ""English is my second language, can you please explain that?"" or something can be an opportunity to talk even more, learn some things, and build further rapport and understanding together.*

>

*If you feel like this date was successful you can either say it at the end or message her later ""I enjoyed our time together today, would you like to do this again?""*

*The date ends when the date ends. There are too many outcomes to give you much advice here. If you feel like it's done then make an excuse like ""I need to leave now for \[xyz reason\] but I enjoyed today, would you like to do this again?""*

>

*I would say politics and anything too opinionated, divisive or controversial. You are getting to know each other, not trying to convince them to agree with you on things. Save that for later.*

  




**Update - 5 days later**



So, I went on the date on Monday evening. I wore a shirt, pants, and sneakers, kept it simple and skipped the flowers. She arrived a bit late but greeted me warmly with a hug and a cheek kiss, apologising for the delay.

We grabbed coffee and pizza, then took a walk in the nearby park. The date ended up lasting almost three hours, and we covered a wide range of topics, avoiding anything too controversial. As the conversation unfolded, I began to notice some significant cultural differences and a fundamental mismatch in our worldviews. I think she sensed it, too.

We wrapped up the date together, and she suggested a second one. I politely dodged it by mentioning a busy schedule. We’ve exchanged a few texts since, but the energy has faded, and it’s clear to both of us that the connection didn’t quite click.

*I just read your original post and I think it’s my favourite ever reddit. Good on you for asking her out, glad you had a good time, and well done for having the wisdom to see there’s a fundamental mismatch. That she suggested a second date seems like she had fun. Hopefully you’ll feel less nervous in future knowing reddit has your back (sorry, I should explain that means everyone on reddit supports you)*

>OOP: Yes, she is cool to hang out with and has a peculiar sense of humour, which I enjoy a lot. I shockingly performed better than I thought I would, except for a few fumbles here and there

Like you’re not interested in finding out more about me as a person but are just looking for a wife appliance. Maybe save those kinds of questions for at least a few weeks in but that’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️.*

>OOP: No, I am not stuck by any deadlines, but settling down by 25-26 is something I ideally want, and I ik things don't turn out the way you always want, I am happy with myself as well whereas she wasn't ready till her mid-30s, and even after that, wasn't keen on having kids These, I think, are major disalignment in our world views

**Cimb0m**

*Of course but you don’t need to ask such questions on your first date. What would happen if you asked her a month later?*

>OOP: Then I guess it would have ended up hurting both of us, because even though we have feelings for each other, our outlooks on life are just too different.

**taylorswifr**

*Awww that’s a shame. What differences did you notice between you two*

>OOP: She’s 21, energetic, adventurous, and the type who wants to explore the world. She mentioned she has no plans to settle down anytime soon, while I’m more of a “date to marry” kind of guy.

>At one point, a kid walked by and she said, “Eww, I’m never having one.” That’s when I knew we weren’t compatible.  
  
I don’t want to be in a relationship just for the sake of it—I’m emotionally wired for long-term.

**deesernutz**

*That's such a mature considered response. I think you'll struggle to find girls seriously thinking about their marriage timeline at 22, but the kid thing I think a lot of people get an idea of pretty early whether they would ever or never consider having them.*

>OOP: Yes, that moment was the last straw; after that, I knew it wouldn't work.

1nqs7w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nqs7w3/am_i_overreacting_over_feeling_hurt_my_fiance/,Am I overreacting over feeling hurt my fiance turned what we planned to be our pregnancy announcement to our young daughter into a moment with his entire family without even talking to me.,"Hey so I just want to understand whether I'm just in my feelings or whether the hurt I'm feeling is justified. Backstory because it ties into the emotional aspect of feeling pushed aside and like I don't have a voice. 

Our child is seven but during our first pregnancy it was an extremely dramatic and chaotic time. I had a  placental abruption so every two weeks for the entire duration of my pregnancy I would have ultrasounds because I was consistently bleeding heavily And it was very up in the air whether our daughter would make it or not for about 6. It was extremely traumatic because prior to that I had four miscarriages and was constantly feeling like I could be losing our baby.  

I got little to no emotional support from my partner because he was going through his own, add in us not being able to afford our apartment anymore because of an arrest (not me) And having one of our cars seized and kept by the police so between court every other month, five grand for a lawyer, thousands more to get another car. We couldn't afford our apartment anymore so we were forced to move in with my fiance's parents halfway through my pregnancy which was devastating.
 
Losing my independence I had for over 5 years plus the ability to have a nursery and nest. we had to move an entire apartment's worth of things plus two dogs into a tiny room that barely fit A queen bed, one small dresser and a crib. When breastfeeding at night I pretty much had to sit on a very uncomfortable pleather loveseat futon thing that you could feel every bar through because there was nowhere with back support to sit in  our room. It was the complete opposite of everything I envisioned my first pregnancy and having my first child would be. 

That first year after giving birth was Joy because I was so happy that our child was healthy but it was mentally shattering and devastating honestly at the same time. I felt like I never had a say, I had to go back to work at 6 weeks and things that I had said I didn't want to happen with my daughter I would find out my fiance's parents were doing through Facebook pictures while I was at work so I was constantly worried and stressed out while also being gas lit that I need to do relax And stop worrying because I couldn't let my very rational fears like letting a very hyperactive 5-year-old hold the baby all by herself without somebody sitting there with her helping her support My 7-week-old babies head especially with a coffee table right in front of her with sharp corners. 

I was consistently told my valid worries were not a big deal and things that I was adamant I did not want or did not agree with for my own child I was not heard or listened to. There were there were many times my fiance used this to his advantage when we had opposing opinions on parenting and he would get his family involved to essentially silence me. 

 During this time his sister who didn't live with us but showed up everyday to lay on the couch and check out as a parent and let her kid run wild was manipulating situations to essentially put a Target on me, I feel like she was jealous that the attention was on me and our new baby and not her and her child anymore so she made sure to lie and manipulate situations to get everyone in the house against me and because it was her parents we lived with obviously she knew exactly what to say and do and it worked.

I felt so extremely alone and had nowhere to go to feel safe. Our room was so small that it's not like I could even go there to have my own sense of security and peace, being in that room just made me feel claustrophobic. I was beyond stressed out, felt the most alone that I've ever felt in my entire life and overwhelmed to the point where I was having panic attacks and breaking down and sobbing every single day. I also got no support from my partner during this time which made everything so much worse. 

 I couldn't do it anymore, I wanted to kill myself on a daily basis and never felt more alone in my life than that year after having my daughter, and I wanted to leave for good but they wouldn't let me take my daughter. They said I can leave but I wasn't taking her and I wasn't about to leave without my daughter so I felt so incredibly stuck and in this massive hole of depression. All while being told by them that I have mental health issues and I have postpartum anxiety and depression while they refuse to even acknowledge the fucking misery and chaos around me and in that house. I don't know how I made it but we were there for 3 years total before me and my fiance bought her own house.

 Fast forward to the situation at hand, I had a miscarriage about 6 months ago but we recently found out we're pregnant again and a lot has changed over the past almost 8 years. 

We're in a better place relationship wise And we both felt like we wanted to do things right this time and he said he wants to make this experience everything that the first time should have been for me And that he wanted to be the supportive loving partner that he wasn't previously. 

Well I'm starting to feel more and more like I'm only getting to partially experience things with him and his focus is more on experiencing it and sharing it with his family. For instance when I found out I was pregnant it's because I was getting sick a lot so we both kind of had a feeling I might be and I took the test while he was at work and when he got home he asked me how they turned out and I showed him started talking to him and within halfway through the first sentence he's not even paying attention to what I'm saying because he's on his phone taking pictures of the test and texting his mom to tell his mom that I'm pregnant. 

He can't text and listen to somebody talking at the same time so it's like I'm being half listened to and his main focus is on informing his whole family so I feel like I am not even able to fully enjoy these experiences with a partner because his focus is on experiencing them with his family which is fine but I would like to have those experiences with him one-on-one too but it's like I don't even get that I get half before his main focus is sharing everything with this family and talking to them about it and telling them how he's feeling and this and that and it's like I'm just over here on the side like alone feeling like I only matter because I'm carrying the baby and that's about it. 

Onto the situation where I'm wondering if I'm overreacting. After ultrasound we went to Target to pick out a stuffed animal so we could transfer print a design and put it on a shirt that says big sister to announce it to our daughter. Before we even left Target he was on the phone with his mom and he told his mom that he would call her after we announced it to our daughter and that we were going to record it so she could see her reaction. Our printer was having issues so I spent at least an hour and a half trying to fix it just to be able to make this perfect and have the announcement go how we wanted. I finally got it working and printed out the design transferred it onto the onesie and put the onesie on the stuffed animal and wrapped everything.

Last I knew he was going to talk to his mom after and this experience was going to be just me and him surprising our daughter and I wanted to make sure that we could talk to her one-on-one to to ease any worries she might have and also I didn't want her to feel put on the spot being told in front of a bunch of people and if my fiance had even thought to ask me if his family could join in on this that's exactly what I would have explained to him but he didn't even give me that chance. 

Obviously since the last time he talked to them about it in front of me he had to have had a conversation with them make alternate decisions about this huge moment for me, him and our daughter. Discussions that he didn't even think to include me in or even tell me about. 

I set up the camera to record her reaction, we gave her the gifts and my fiance was sitting holding up his phone and I thought he was recording his own video because he often does that even if I'm recording something.

My daughter opens it up realizes that we're having a baby and that she's going to be a big sister and then all of a sudden I hear his mom yell out ""how do you feel about that?! what do you think you think ??"" 

and then I hear his sister and his sisters older daughter talking in the background and then his sister's younger daughter was yelling in the background and I realized that literally every single person in his family is on FaceTime right now and that he wasn't recording a video.

 I couldn't even ask her anything because they all started talking and his mom and his sister dominated asking my daughter things. Then My daughter was more focused with who was on the phone and then my fiance was mainly focused on talking to them and I was just standing there like so fucking hurt that after everything that he would do that without even talking to me, without even asking me how I would feel especially knowing everything that was taken away from me and everything that went wrong in my our first pregnancy because of him and his family. 

I felt so devastated that he would turn around and just change something like that without even talking to me and I felt excluded from it yet again because they're all talking, his family's asking her questions that she barely answered because I feel like she felt put on the spot or overwhelmed with hearing the news and then everyone asking her questions and him and his family talking back and forth and I'm just standing there like feeling so betrayed that he made a whole plan about calling them and having them on FaceTime and all of that and didn't even think to mention it to me when he knew how big this was for me and for us but after having a private conversation with just him and his family that's the opposite of what I was told.

it's turned from an intimate moment between me him and our daughter into a family affair where everyone's yelling out questions and his mom didn't even think to like I don't know let me say a single thing to my own daughter first before yelling out a bunch of questions and his sister has her youngest daughter on there like screaming in the background and it just felt  ruined to me at that point.

I also feel like my daughter wouldn't have had that reaction if it was just me and her dad talking to her so I'm hurt about that too and I kind of just shut down. I feel like what happened in my first pregnancy  is happening all over again and how I feel just doesn't even matter, I'm just really sad. 

He said that he's sorry and I said how can you be sorry when you don't even know what the issue is and he said well I know you're probably upset at me but I have no idea what I could have done to make you upset but I'm still sorry that you're upset. Even though after I realize his whole family was on FaceTime and he saw my face drop, eventually when they got off the phone I said why wouldn't you have asked me how I felt about you having your entire family on FaceTime especially knowing the last you guys told me you were going to call them after and I was going to record it for them but he can't possibly fathom why I could be feeling hurt or sad at any of this.

 I don't know I'm sorry this was such a long post I just really want to know if I'm just being emotional right now or if my feelings are valid and what I even do to fix this with somebody who gets very defensive if they even perceive that their words or actions are being criticized.

1nqs7cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nqs7cr/how_does_a_coffee_grinder_compare_to_a_blender/,How does a coffee grinder compare to a blender?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a journey to find the perfect cup of coffee, and I wanted to share my experience comparing coffee grinders and blenders. Trust me, I've tried everything possible to get that perfect morning brew.

Let me tell you something - while blenders might seem like a convenient alternative, they're just not cut out for grinding coffee beans. I learned this the hard way after destroying some expensive beans in my fancy blender (ouch!).

Here's the thing: coffee grinders are specifically designed to crush beans uniformly, which is crucial for extracting the best flavor. They use burrs or blades that work at the perfect speed and angle. I recently picked up this amazing grinder from https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder, and the difference in my morning coffee is like night and day.

When you use a blender, you'll notice several problems:
- Inconsistent grind size (some powder, some chunks)
- Heat from high-speed blades that can burn your beans
- Loss of essential oils and aromatics
- Messy cleanup (coffee dust everywhere!)

The science behind it is pretty interesting. Coffee needs to be ground to specific sizes for different brewing methods. For example, espresso needs fine grounds, while French press requires coarse ones. A proper grinder gives you this control, while a blender just... well, blends.

I used to think spending money on a dedicated grinder was unnecessary until I tried one. The flavor improvement was incredible! If you're serious about coffee, check out some quality grinders at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. They have options for every budget and brewing style.

Some extra tips I've learned:
- Clean your grinder regularly
- Grind only what you need for immediate use
- Store beans in an airtight container
- Avoid pre-ground coffee when possible

The bottom line? While a blender might seem like a money-saving hack, it'll actually waste your precious beans and give you subpar coffee. Plus, a good grinder will last for years with proper care.

Let me ask you something — have you ever felt that slight panic when realizing everyone around you is learning the new AI tools while you’re still figuring out how to customize your Zoom background? 😅 It’s like being at a buffet and watching everyone grab the tastiest dishes while you’re left with just a salad! But guess what? **You can upgrade your plate!** The truth is, upskilling in AI isn’t just a good idea; it’s *essential* if you want to keep your spot at the table of opportunity. 

**Why should you upskill NOW?** Here are a few spicy reasons:

- **The AI revolution is here**: It’s like a high-speed train, and either you hop on or watch it zoom away. 🚄
- **Job market evolution**: Every industry is now intertwined with AI. Think of it like having a smartphone — can you imagine going back to a flip phone? No way! 
- **Your creativity matters more than you think**: With tools powered by AI, your ideas can come to life faster. Like having an assistant who knows you inside out (but doesn't eat your snacks... seriously).

So, what can you do to upskill? Here are some quick and effective methods to dive in:

1. **Online courses**: Seriously, you can learn anything these days. Check out platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or even the specific program I found which is super helpful: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). You never know what you might uncover. 
   
2. **Join community groups**: Engage with others who are on the same journey. Even a friendly chat can spark ideas! *Ever had that moment of ‘OMG, I didn’t know that!’?*

3. **DIY projects**: Don’t just sit there — create! Whether it’s building a simple chatbot or automating a report, hands-on experience is priceless.

4. **Stay updated**: Follow AI blogs, podcasts, and YouTubers. You want to hear about the latest trends while sipping your coffee, right? ☕️

5. **Network, network, network**: Talk to people in the industry. You might find that someone who ‘has it all together’ started from scratch just like you — now that’s inspiring! 

Remember, no one expects you to be a wizard overnight! It’s all about the small steps that lead to great things. Plus, if you find yourself in a rut, just laugh it off — it happens to the best of us. 

In a world where AI is changing the game faster than we can say “machine learning,” *what’s stopping you from joining the party?* 🎉

About me:

The accent is 100% authentic. It’s particularly effective for ordering coffee and confusing telemarketers.

I enjoy a good single malt whisky, but I'm quickly developing an appreciation for Pennsylvania's local breweries.

My passions lie somewhere between getting out for a good hike on a crisp autumn day and getting cozy on the sofa with a great film (anything from a tense thriller to a stupidly funny comedy).

I have my life together—stable career, own place, can cook a few decent meals that don't involve haggis (unless you're into that).

My sense of humor is a bit dry, a bit sarcastic, and essential for navigating life. I believe laughing, especially at yourself, is a vital life skill.

Who I'm looking for:

A woman (let's say 35-55ish) who is kind, intelligent, and doesn't take herself too seriously. Someone who can hold a conversation that goes beyond small talk, who is passionate about something, and who believes a good partner is a teammate. A shared sense of humor is a massive plus.

He’s a multimillionaire and showed me his portfolio, so the money is real, and on paper it’s a huge opportunity.

But here’s where I feel conflicted. He talks a lot about his wealth, yet he keeps certain things oddly private — like not letting me see where he’s staying. He’s also brought up other women in conversation, which felt off. For example, he compared me to the girl he dated before, saying she didn’t have the “vision” I do, and added that he doesn’t want a “trophy wife” — which felt like a jab.

To give context, he’s been through a lot in the past eight years: surviving cancer &a divorce. Part of me wonders if his intensity comes from wanting a fresh start after so much hardship. But it’s still jarring that someone so intelligent and established would uproot his life for someone he barely knows.

I’m trying to stay grounded. On one hand, I feel like I have nothing to lose by hearing him out. On the other, I don’t want to ignore potential red flags. Am I being overly cautious, or does something about this seem off?",2,1758860758.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False
1nqrzld,https://i.redd.it/vq5qdo21sfrf1.jpeg,Doxing claims from her latest video,"

She’s literally doxing herself while pointing fingers at being doxed. Also, I want to point out a couple lies in her story. She says the three circled areas is her children’s school, home and coffee shop. This is a huge story line as to why she’s pulling her kids out and homeschooling. Because she claims the school was shown: name and all. 
Lie 1: Google maps marks airports in blue font and schools in peach font. That far right is an airport circled. Not your children’s school. The same airport you have told people to go to so you can give them their puppies. 
Lie 2: You recently said on a live “Thank God they got the wrong coffee shop”. So why are you still running with this narrative? You DoorDash your coffee anyway (we have witnessed it multiple times on live) or have your butler aka husband get it for you. 
Lie 3: you claim your home was circled and address doxed. All I see is a military housing base circled. Since you like to google. A quick google search of bases near airports and there you go and no this isn’t doxing since there are a TON of bases in Texas. So does this mean you guys live on base instead of a up and coming housing development like you claimed? Since she has told us they are building homes and not many people live around her. But if it’s an Air Force base housing development then I’d think it’s pretty well established.. idk doesn’t add up. 

I hope she can just find peace within herself and get more intense therapy. She claims she does therapy but I beg to differ. Her actions speak louder than words

I've been sober for a while now but i still go through periods where I feel a bit lost

It’s weird, I thought being sober would feel like this huge life transformation every day. Most of the time it’s not. It’s just… life. Waking up, making coffee, going to work, arguing with my kid about chores, zoning out on the couch at night.

The difference is I’m actually there for it now. No hangovers, no piecing together what I said last night, no random guilt hitting me at 3 AM. It’s not fireworks, but it’s real.

Sometimes I miss the chaos. Sometimes I just miss feeling different. But I don’t miss the aftermath.

Anyone else feel like sobriety is kinda boring in the best possible way?",5,1758860566.0,dryalcoholics,0,1.0,False
1nqrxgy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqrxgy,XL Santos-Dumont – winding this beast feels like starting a vintage car,"Picked up [the extra large Santos-Dumont](https://cartierwatchdupe.io/products/super-clone-f1-factory-santos-dumont-watch-all-sizes-model-two-tone-case-black-dial-black-strap) in two-tone (steel + gold bezel, black dial, leather strap). It’s manual wind, which means no lazy rotor doing the job for you — you’ve actually got to turn the crown yourself.

And honestly? That’s half the fun. Every morning a few clicks on the crown and you feel the spring tighten up. It’s like giving it a shot of espresso before the day starts. No rotor noise, no weight swinging around inside, just pure old-school mechanics.

The XL size gives it wrist presence without going over the top, and the black sunray dial + Roman numerals keep it classic. The exposed screws on the bezel add that industrial touch that makes [the Santos](https://cartierwatchdupe.io/products/super-clone-f1-factory-santos-dumont-watch-all-sizes-model-two-tone-case-black-dial-black-strap) line what it is.

Specs for the curious:

* XL two-tone case (steel body + gold bezel)
* Black dial with Roman numerals
* Manual wind movement
* Blued cabochon crown
* Black leather strap

For me, winding it is part of the ritual, like tying your shoes or making coffee. Some people prefer automatics for convenience, but if you enjoy the interaction, hand-wound just feels alive.

Anyone else actually *like* the daily wind, or do you find it annoying?",2,1758860556.0,CartierReplicaWatches,0,1.0,False
1nqrwsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nqrwsf/should_i_end_things/,Should I end things?,"I’ve been talking to this guy and lately he’s stopped showing me as much interest as he used to. He used to compliment me, buy me gifts, and text me frequently. He’s stopped buying me things, but he’s unemployed. He has been unemployed since the beginning and didn’t have much of an issue buying me things. He used to buy me coffee when we hang out but stopped. He still buys me food though. He used to compliment me ALOT but hasn’t in two months. He used to make jokes about how he couldn’t help himself when complimenting me but now he doesn’t. He used to text me every few hours (this isn’t an issue as we both agreed constantly texting all day was annoying) but now he responds once a day, if that. He says he’s going through some stuff and hasn’t been on his phone. But when we hang out he checks it almost every 20 minutes. I feel like I’m hanging onto something that isn’t there anymore. I asked him a month ago if he still liked me and he told me yes and that he was just going through some stuff. I plan on asking again but I’m conflicted. Should I end things regardless of the answer? I don’t want to end things if he really is going through a hard time. I really like him, but the way he’s been treating me has been making me feel terrible. I don’t want to seem selfish demanding he pays more attention to me when he’s struggling, but I just don’t know what to do. Everything I do makes me feel like I’m bothering him. I’m not sure he wants to hang out with me but he mentions doing things together in the future. I just don’t understand what’s going on and I don’t know what to do.
