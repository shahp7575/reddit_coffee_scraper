1ga6wyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ga6wyw/how_do_my_signals_come_across/,How do my signals come across?,"TL,DR; I jokingly invited my crush to a rewatch of a 6h TV season with dinner along the way and she agreed

Since telling her about my developing feelings, we went to hang out a few times already (Museum/Art Gallery, coffee at her place and in public, to the movies). We have really good chemistry and honestly it's only gotten better since. We've known each other and been close friends for years.

So now I invited my her to watch a 6h season of tv with dinner (cooking together).

We watched that series already last year and discussed it heavily. She liked it, even though she had some problems with it and the series is kinda raunchy in some scenes, though I don't know if she specifically remembers those parts.

In my mind this aspect made the offer kinda ridiculous. I thought she would just laugh it off.

To that end I asked her in a joking manner, however she agreed and despite us seeing each other on two occasions over the next three weeks, she proposed the Idea to meet up early next week.

I did not specifically call it a date, however I did use the word in a rounabout way at the end of the invitation.  ",1,1729678085.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1ga6vxp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ga6vxp,Few questions about a table I‚Äôm making.,"Pics are for reference, they are not mine.

I do wood working but I‚Äôm new to resin, so naturally I want to do they most difficult thing as my first project lol

Basically I‚Äôm making a coffee table that has ‚Äúmelted‚Äù wood look to it hanging over the sides. I contemplated using stains or dyes but it doesnt give me that clean, vibrant, ‚Äúpop‚Äù I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm also looking for it to have a hard surface so I figured resin may be a good option. 

So my question is:
I don‚Äôt want to do the top and sides individually and then put them together as I‚Äôm wanting it to look clean and ‚Äúwhole‚Äù with the ‚Äúpattern‚Äù of the resin and not mismatched‚Ä¶.is it possible to do it as just one piece? I understand the table curves downwards and resin dripping down is kinda the vibe of the table as long as it‚Äôs evenly coated as well.

The only thing I can think of in my limited experience is getting a thicker resin or adding fiberglass to it and babysitting with a heat gun.

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for your time. ",1,1729677973.0,resin,0,1.0,False

So much it hurts to my core ,"It's like grieving the death of someone, except I'm grieving myself and my own life. I listen to songs from my favorite periods in life, trying to remember. Nothing but faint images come up with no feelings attached, and it doesn't feel like it was my life. I'm thinking of my last trip to nyc and how amazing it was. There's a song that reminds me of that trip, but I can't feel any of the feelings: nyc is one of my favorite places in the world. I remember the awe of all the lights, smells, sights - I was in my own world exploring and taking in every sense.

My senses are gone. I don't get any feelings or emotions for a song, a favorite memory, a fun event coming up. It's truly the worst punishment to live this way. My life is just slipping through my hands like sand and I have no clue how I'll ever feel those things again. I felt such excitement and joy for life, even in the hard moments, even in my absolute worst times - I was still me. I had so many emotions, connections and feelings. The world was so beautiful. Nature. The sky. Cities. My sweet dog. feeling happy for no reason. dancing all night with friends and feeling loved & connected. the holiday cheer. the warm sun . I loved all of it. I could just curl up into a ball and cry at all I've lost, but I can't even cry. I realized today that I don't even physical pain anymore. I could cut my finger off and wouldn't feel it, and wouldn't feel any fear or loss. During my traumas, I remember everything feeling so surreal, so strange and scary. Those feelings are gone. I'm just a statue basically. I don't know how my body and mind still function. Life is such a short and beautiful gift when you can feeel and experience it all. Not having emotions is like living forever - having the ups, downs, pain etc makes it all worth it. When you can't feel anything and every day is a repeat of the last, life loses all purpose and meaning. I just want to feel like me again. I loved me, and I took him for granted. I feel so damaged, broken and destroyed. My life that I worked so hard to build, it's all a black hole of nothing now. I'd give anything to feel that morning air, to enjoy a cup of coffee. To plan a trip to nyc and feel that excitement and joy for it. I might as well have died, it feels like I'm frozen in a block of ice. The pain of spending my life like this is unbearable. I want it all back, I hate what I've become.",2,1729677908.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had a couple of other paranormal experiences but I‚Äôve shared them with few, and not fully to anyone. Not even my closest family members. This will be the first time. It started in the year 2000, with this -

I lost around 15 hours of time, which is weird enough, but this happened at the Glastonbury Festival in 2000, and it happened to two out of the four people I went with. Myself and my friend Col. We were sharing a tent.

We had gotten up pretty early after being awoken by the dance tent, which wasn‚Äôt far from where we were camped. We tried waking the others, but they were not getting up. The last thing we remembered was zipping up the tent at around 07:00 and setting off for a 5 minute walk to grab a coffee and some breakfast. I ‚Äòwoke up‚Äô at around 22:30 that night, stood next to a small generator behind a drinks shack, just off the main road that runs behind the pyramid stage. Sober as a judge, wide awake and extremely thirsty. I checked my pockets instinctively and found everything intact. I even had a ten deck of cigarettes in my shirt pocket with nine left. I smoked one when i got up that morning. I apparently hadn‚Äôt smoked another all day. I made my way back to the tent immediately where I found Col, curled up in his sleeping bag having arrived back at the tent just 10 mins before me, having had the exact same experience.

Col would not speak about it, even with me. He avoided the subject at all costs whenever I brought it up. He was weirded out, as I was. I didn‚Äôt see col much after that. He ended up in prison and I moved to Manchester. Col committed \*\*\*\*\*\*\* in 2012. I‚Äôve no clue if this is related but I thought it worth mentioning.

I have never undergone any form of regression and I have no memory whatsoever about what happened that day. Ive had a few ‚Äôparanormal‚Äô experiences since. Dreams, that may relate, I don‚Äôt know. An incident of paralysis while in bed, fully awake, with a presence looming over me that I could not see, amongst other strange things. Most recently seeing a UFO in 2018, which had me looking into the topic. What I saw was unexplainable. But, I stumbled upon the ‚Äòmissing time‚Äô phenomenon while doing that and may have had a mini heart attack when i listened to a few peoples experiences.

I‚Äôve never used Reddit. I created this account today to get this off my chest. I know I‚Äôm not the only one to have experienced this, now. But I‚Äôve never spoken to anybody that has, other than Col, and even he wouldn‚Äôt really discuss it.

Almost never to insult them but definitely in a way that we never would in front of someone who would understand what we were saying. In five years never once did we experience someone we were talking about giving the slightest indication of actually understanding us. But I didn't get off Scot free. One day I was out shopping with a good friend of mine and we were taking a break to have some coffee in the terrace seating of a cafe. I start talking about the appearance of someone sitting near us at a different table and my friend looks at me like I'm insane. For a moment I'm puzzled and then my brain catches up to the fact that this is one of my Spanish friends, we were speaking Spanish, and I just made weird comments in Spanish about a Spanish person right next to me. It's not that I forgot what language I was speaking per se, I had just gotten in such a habit of talking about people right in front of them that I did it without thinking.

","Quarter-life Crisis is real. For a second, I wonder if I'm going insane. But insane people don't think that they are going insane, right? Everybody knows that. Is it natural to wonder if my existential dread is triggered by reliving a series of stupid mistakes I made when I first stepped into independence and adulthood? Or is it from repeating these same mistakes knowingly and willingly? It makes me wonder if I‚Äôm some sort of emotional masochist.

The inability to change myself, combined with anxiety and self-awareness, is a sinister mix and the root of my dread. Sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs easier to live in denial rather than be self-aware. It‚Äôs time to embrace my feelings instead of bottling them up and projecting a tough exterior. Maybe that‚Äôs the only way I can break out of this vicious cycle of fear and loathing.

I‚Äôm at that phase in life where all my friends have moved on or settled down with family and kids. Being single and pushing 30 is not an ideal place to meet new people or make new friends. I hope to find something real‚Äîcould be a friend, could be something more. A deeper connection and meaningful conversation. Is that too much to ask for? I really hope not.

I‚Äôm on a fitness journey, low-key taking the winter arc seriously, and trying to bring some much-needed discipline into my life. Eating healthy, getting proper sleep, and consistently working out and hitting my goals for the past two months have been keeping me sane. If you‚Äôre on a similar journey, let‚Äôs keep each other accountable.

I absolutely love banter of all kinds, as long as no feelings are hurt. TV shows, music, and football are my escape from reality. I‚Äôm a decent cook and would love to share healthy recipes. I‚Äôm weirdly in love with all things black and dark‚Äîfrom my favorite color to how I prefer my coffee, and even the sort of humor I enjoy. If you can relate to me and you‚Äôre looking for something similar, let‚Äôs connect over DM and take it from there.

1ga6htw,https://i.redd.it/a1tkqxop7hwd1.jpeg,‚òï Starbucks SBUX Falls 5% Premarket,"Starbucks has just reported its largest quarterly sales decline in four years, with a 7% drop in comparable sales. This stumble has sent its stock down 4.2% in after-hours trading, leaving many investors wondering about the future of the coffee giant. Along with the disappointing sales figures, Starbucks has withdrawn its financial forecast for 2025, citing the need to reassess their strategy after a challenging period.

The company has seen a slowdown both in the U.S. and internationally, with China sales falling by a notable 14%. The departure of their CEO earlier this year and the recent leadership change have added to investor uncertainty. While new leadership has a plan to revitalize growth, the market response suggests there‚Äôs skepticism about how quickly these changes will take effect.

For investors, this could signal either a time to buy on weakness or a warning to wait for stability. Starbucks remains a major player, but the current volatility means traders need to carefully watch how the next quarter unfolds.",1,1729676310.0,freedom24,1,1.0,False

That change was that I started eating only one big meal for dinner every day and skipping breakfast and lunch completely. The goal was hunger control and to lose weight and it certainly works for that and I noticed from the first day that my sleep was much deeper than it used to be.

The first day I did this my senses became hyper active. It's like taking 10 cups of coffee at once. It was as if I just activated survival mode. This feeling stayed on the successive days but I got used to it and it became a normal part of my day and I actually enjoy it because it makes me feel more alive.

So to everyone, if you're desperate to sleep, or not even yet, give this method a try. It works wonders for sleep and for losing weight and you will always look forward to having a big dinner. Of course use common sense and don't eat this meal 2 hours before bed, but more like 4-5 hours or so.",2,1729676135.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

I decided to try it out, thinking it was a meditational thing. I went to the intro meeting, and I kinda got started on the thing. It turns out it is about chanting, and I have to chant twice a day. 

Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt say no at first. But a couple of months in now, I feel obligated to chant every day. People talk about putting this to the test and trying to be really positive. 

I come from Nepal, where Buddha was born.  I am Buddhist by culture, not religion. Though I was born hindu, I have always been to buddhist stupa and matter of fact that in my country, buddha is found worshiped likely to a hindu god in some temples. Most stupas are surrounded by hindu temple. You‚Äôll find a ton of buddhist monks in a hindu temple. We are culturally different on how we perceive buddhism. I feel people from the SGI community don‚Äôt give a damn about it.

The more I have people talking with me about the community, the more I question the whole thing. My questions:

\-Why should I learn so much about the founders of SGI?

\- Is SGI about Buddha or about their founders? Once, in a meeting, I shared in a meeting that I had been to Buddha‚Äôs actual birthplace (Lumbini, Nepal), and everybody was disinterested at once. Why?

\- The person who introduced me to SGI sends me motivational quotes and posts every day and asks me to chant in the morning and evening. They follow up every day. Why? If the practice is pure, why do I feel they are forcing me?

\- They sold me on ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find a job soon if you chant every day.‚Äù But now I see people in the community who haven‚Äôt gotten jobs for 2 years. Has anyone put things to the test, and it worked out for you?

\- Does chanting help? When I visited the center, why were there so many people chanting? What do they get? 

\- Every time there is a gathering, why do we have to take a picture?

\- Once, a member from the young men's division asked to meet at a coffee shop. We met and had a normal chat. Why? We are not good friends to chat as well. The chat wasn‚Äôt great too. It felt like a formality, and weird thing he asked to take a picture at the end. And since then, I haven‚Äôt had a chat with him again. Why did we meet? What do these people do with pictures?

1ga6f30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1ga6f30/315_training_plan/,3:15 training plan? ,"Hi... 

Long time lurker, M45. New-ish to serious marathon training. Been running for 4 years now, with a couple long and short injury-interruptions. No athletic background, hardly any sports what so ever actually, let alone any endurance sports.

Finished my 3d marathon 10 days ago in 3:25, 13 minutes faster than my previous PB from October last year... And it actually felt less painfull than last year, with just 3 days of pretty mild muscle soreness afterwards, and dispite the 3 weeks of zero miles during my holiday in the middle of my training block. So I guess those are some of the things that give me confidence that shooting for 3:15 might not be overly ambitious if I take my training a little more seriously.

Plan on doing regular core/mobility excersises as well as strenght workouts and plyometrics, I'm cutting down on alcohol and coffee to optimize my recovery, and I'm cleaning up my diet and getting my weight down by a couple kg. I might also look into carbon plated racing shoes, but that's a top priority in my game plan right now. 

  
I'm mainly looking for a training schedule. Anyone know of a particular training plan that's recommended for my specific situation and goal? Preferably something that's easy to digest and ready to use, in km and min/km :)

Cheers.

My wife and I live in a boat, and I wanted to make some coffee. I take out the machines from the pantry, set them up, and then I go through the ingredients one by one. Coffee grounds, pieces of water, powdered sugar, coral powder, grucelantan chocolate mix, all the things that go in a traditional coffee.



My wife sees the ingredients, and for some reason, thinks I'm joking about the coral powder. She makes a sarcastic comment like ""Oh yeah, you're totally using coral powder on your coffee"". I casually respond that I do, and that's when she blows up. She cannot believe that I'm actually using coral powder in coffee, which leaves me surprised, because it's a very common coffee ingredient. She keeps calling it ""Emerald powder"" for some reason, which I keep correcting her over, and now we're getting a divorce.

For a bit of context, when she was a child her mother forbid her from eating unhealthy foods (like sweets, soda, fast-food etc). 
And apparently she forced her to drink at least once a week a cup of matcha tea. I had no idea about the last part. I apologized and promised her to be more careful about it in the future.

I kinda would like to give some things i noticed i definitely want and dont want and hope someone can give me input on what to do with good reasoning. 

First i need to say i got an Oracle Jet last week. It was so intriguing with the semi automatic approach and high quality parts for the price i paid (1425‚Ç¨). Having had it for a week i most definitely wont be keeping my unit though. The machine came with a few visual defects out of the factory and the results it gives me are first of not very consistent and for the price not that great. Was only ready to break my first set price limit because the machine looked perfect in terms of features. Im a coffee enjoyer and had full autos in the past but most definitely dont want another bean to cup machine.

Here is what is important to me:
- i dont mind doing some things manually but i definitely draw a line at predosing. Quick WDT routine, tamping and a puck shield at most but weighing my beans regulary just feels like too much and something that will piss me off in the near future. Same goes with preheating everything with two to three blank shots or waiting a heat up time for 10+min. I know i leave some quality on the table with that but its simply not what im looking for.
- milk drinks is what i mostly consume with a nice espresso every now and then so a somewhat capable steam wand is mandatory. Would do it manually so auto function not necessary here.
- i dont plan to upgrade seperate parts of the setup. If i get something new down the line it will be both the coffee machine and the grinder (if they turn out to be seperate devices) exception would be some accessories that are universal
- looks. Yea i know that shouldnt be a deciding factor but because of weird spacing in my flat the coffee machine would be placed in the living room. Here most of the stuff is black/ white and stainless with some slight hits of dark green so i dont want to put some very weird accents color in here.

With these restrictions i came to three possible options:

1. Sage Barista Express Impress (~620‚Ç¨) with a Naked Porta filter (~60‚Ç¨). Would be a cheaper version of the oracle jet that would give me with a bit more of manual tweaking close enough (and maybe more consistent) results to the oracle jet while saving a lot of money in the process

2. Sage Bambino Plus with the Sage dose control pro (~620‚Ç¨) with added Porta Filter and Tamping accessories (~150‚Ç¨). Slightly more expensive with even more control. Probably better grinders available out there but considering i dont want to predose and get uniform looks its the best ive found.

3. Getting the Oracle Jet swapped out to get rid of the marks and deal with the incosistency. This would be the toughest pill to swallow because the quality i got really put me off the 1400+‚Ç¨ asking price. But maybe im in the wrong and i just expected too much from it and its still the best machine for my usecase.

Really dont have any tendency at the moment because all machines have there pros and cons (and stuff i might dont see). Would love to get some Input, maybe completely different ideas, so i can finally come to a conclusion",1,1729674342.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

After what felt like years (long enough that I thought the phone had been disconnected), she asks for an extra towel. ""Of course,"" I say, putting off her behavior as a bit of drunken nonsense. Nothing unusual.

Because God is merciful, I work with an overnight houseman who handles requests like this, so I basically never have to leave the front desk. I text him, he gives me the okay, then pops into the storage closet to grab this woman's towel. The phone rings again. It's her.

I pick up, and...silence, again. Then laughter. Not giggling, *laughter.* Bone-chilling, haunted house laughter. I'm thinking there must be someone in the room with her, but she's the only one listed on the reservation and I can't hear anyone else. Just her. Just laughing.

""Ma'am?"" I repeat a few times, before finally she sucks in a massive breath and asks for a wine glass. She says it so softly that I question if it's the same woman. I tell her I'll have it brought to her room, and she hangs up without another word.

Over the next half hour, she does this *FOUR MORE TIMES*. Up and down my houseman goes, bringing toilet paper and hand towels and a bathrobe and slippers, one at a time. Each time she calls, I ask if there's *anything else* we can bring her, and each time she says no. The houseman never sees her, never hears her, but each time he goes back up the previous item he delivered is gone. At this point, she stops calling, and just when I think we're free...the phone rings.

Cue the witch cackle. ""Coffee pods?"" she says, once whatever ritual she's performing is done. 

""Of course,"" I stammer. ""I'll have them brought to your room now.""

""Nonononono. I want to come down and get them. I'm coming down now."" Giggle. *Click.*

I've dealt with drunks. I've dealt with addicts. None of them have ever truly unnerved me the way this woman has. I feel like I'm in the fucking Twilight Zone. It's been twenty minutes and she still hasn't come down. Why did she I'm just sitting here, waiting for the Babadook or that girl from The Ring to come crawling out of the elevator. I don't get paid enough for this. Please send help, or holy water.",25,1729674155.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,9,1.0,False

(If people I know recognise me from this post, then please text me and we can talk about it. Please don‚Äôt gossip or make it a big deal without talking with me first. I just wanted to rant anonymously)

I (24f) have been friends with ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù (24m) since we were in a band together in high school. We had a rotating group of close friends from overlapping friend groups who met up for dinner and/or drinks regularly with an annual cabin trip to my family‚Äôs cabin.

When I met John he was in a happy relationship with a girl from a different school he had gone previously. To my knowledge the had a long relationship that fell apart naturally as they grew up and got closer to adulthood and they spilt amicably as far as I know.

A couple of years ago on (what turned out to be) our last cabin trip he admitted/confessed to us that he had had a girlfriend for 3 months and hadn‚Äôt told us yet. I was thinking that it was good for him and I was happy that he had found a relationship. Later on I spoke about it with another guy who was on the trip and he said that he found it weird that John hadn‚Äôt told him, at least, sooner and that John didn‚Äôt seem proud to share the happy news. And came to see it the same way. That John had spent 3 months in a committed relationship and had felt the need to hide it from his friends. That was the first red flag.

Months went by and when I or others asked he said he was happy in his relationship but that his girlfriend had some issues that he didn‚Äôt feel like he could help her with and that he felt some guilt about not being able to help her. I gave him the best advice I could think of and we all hoped the issues would get better.
They apparently did not. But John just stopped talking to us about it. 

It came time for johns birthday, maybe his 21th or 22th maybe, I don‚Äôt remember, but they had been together for more than a year at this point. John had told me and another friend from the group that he would have preferred to host friends at home and keep it simple with costs, but that ‚ÄúChristal‚Äù would rather have a big joined birthday party for both of them. It was like 4 months past her birthday, but whatever. Christal decided that it should be half her friends and half his friends and if any of her friends couldn‚Äôt make it then one of his friends had to drop out as well. I thought that was weird when he told me and I offered voluntarily to be the first to be cut, if it needed to happen so that John wouldn‚Äôt feel too bad about having to choose one of his friends to un-invite. I had to go to work bartending later that evening anyways.
But the big party Christal had hoped for became a dinner at a semi-fancy burger place and fun and games at a board game caf√© afterwards. 

Dinner was weird. It didn‚Äôt seem like Christal and John spoke to each other and when John spoke with his invited friends she would get a bit huffy and either break up his conversation or try to have an ‚Äòeven better‚Äô conversation with her own friends. It seemed to me like she was trying to compete with him or simply monopolise his attention. 
She was also rude to the staff at the restaurant and spoke not-so-nicely about the food at the restaurant she chose(!) I also don‚Äôt think she spoke very nicely to her own friends either and she didn‚Äôt seem to really want to talk with me or johns other friends

I had to go to work after dinner and said goodbye to my friends in front of the board game caf√© and wished happy birthday to John. 
Later, a few of mine and Johns friends came to my bar and told me what had happened after I left. 
Christal had chosen the game they would all play and Christal had decided that it was to be her friends vs his friends. And when him and his friends had won the first two rounds of the game she apparently got mad and tried to argue the rules of the game and tried to move the game pieces when no one was looking. (Like, girl, u chose the game and get mad when ur friends are stupid at a game u picked. Tsk tsk)
I was told that the evening ended shortly after her teams 3rd loss in the game and she loudly wanted to go home and John had to join her and no one was allowed to go to my bar after(!) this was maybe what made my friends even more eager to come tell me everything.

Time went on. John invited me to a Christmas party at his and hers place, but told me I should coordinate final plans with Christal. So she and I wrote a bit back and forth. I love cooking and offered to bring anything they wanted. She responded that it would be lovely if I could bring something un-specifically specific. Think ‚Äòsalad‚Äô, no further notes. I forget exactly what it was, but it was still something I could and would make. I write a message with a couple of questions and variations of salad. But oh no, her friend was deathly allergic to an ingredient in the dish I suggested. That‚Äôs fair, we don‚Äôt wanna kill anyone at Christmas. I suggest something else, but oh no that wouldn‚Äôt do either because xyz. After a few back and forths over 2-3 days i got tired of my suggestions getting shot down . So I ask her to simply tell me exactly what to make and I would happily make it to her precise wishes. I just wanted to bring something they wanted to their Christmas party. After that it was radio silence for a few days until John wrote to me saying the party was cancelled and Christal wasn‚Äôt happy with him. 
If I am being self-centred about it, I think she cancelled the party just so that I wouldn‚Äôt be there. It was most likely something else. But John had told me several times after the failed party that Christal wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of mine. And I thought ‚Äòfair, we don‚Äôt all have to be friends. And as long as she is good to John, then it isn‚Äôt my place to comment or impose in any way on their relationship‚Äô that‚Äôs their business. 

Time went on and John and I honestly drifted apart because she didn‚Äôt allow him to see his opposite gender friends. John and I went out with other friends from the group to have coffee or just hang out sporadically and on several of those occasions he asked me to not post anything on social media about it because she would see that he and I were in the same place and she would call him to order him home. (I don‚Äôt really post a lot on social media. But like damn wtf)

A few weeks ago John commented on an IG post of mine and we talked a bit about how things were going. Then. He told me that they were broken up. And I almost couldn‚Äôt hide my happiness. I‚Äôm glad the conversation was over text. 

I do see how all of this could read like a pick-me girl rant but this is all extremely platonic on my end. Maybe I had a crush on him briefly when we were 17 and he was single, but nothing like that ever since. He is my friend and I will do what I can to support my friend. 

I don‚Äôt hate Christal. I don‚Äôt like her either but I don‚Äôt hate her. My personal interactions haven‚Äôt been positive and the stories I have heard about her have been worse. But I can forgive a lot. I can‚Äôt blame her for having issues or struggling in life. She weren‚Äôt dealt the best hand in life. She had/has some psych-issues that I relate heavily with. I have/had a lot of similar problems in my life and maybe her and I would have been friends if she hadn‚Äôt acted childish, spiteful and jealous to me and others.
I judge her for her actions and I hate what she has done to my friend.

I am happy they broke up and now I want to support my friend.",3,1729673910.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Apologies for the terrible photography... trying not to dox anyone!

  
**The food:**

I tried the 1/4 Jerk Chicken, Mac and Cheese, Fries and Rice n' peas. All the food was really good. If you've got Mac and Cheese somewhere else, this one is quite a bit more earthy/mushroom-y if that makes sense. 

The jerk chicken is tender and the skin was probably what I'd describe as mildly spicy. Fries are seasoned, and I have no idea what with, but if you told me I had to eat these as my only meal for the next month, I probably wouldn't be sad.

The Rice n' peas are like the perfect comfort food. So much flavour, would be an amazing main dish by itself to be honest.

We also tried two flavours of rum - coffee and banana. Absolutely amazing. Even better if you mix them together. These are the absolute compliment to this type of food, so absolutely order some if you're going here.

  
**The service:**

If you're looking for fast food, this probably isn't the place. It was PACKED on a Wednesday night and was constantly filling up as people left, so food took a while, but the guy who served us (I believe he's the owner) was an absolute GC and you know... good things take time

  
**The dinner club:**

Highly suggest you join next time, great people, great time... and we're all getting shirts with u/dramaqueenboo on them for the next meetup.

As roaches love dark and warm places I found a nest in our coffee machine and they were running up my arm while holding the coffee pot. 

My workplace called an exterminator who warned us that roaches can use us as taxis, too, traveling into our homes. Also settling into our laptops or phones which I am sometimes required to take home.

I decided to start using separate clothes and shoes for work and follow the recommendations from the exterminator to change at home immediately and put worn clothes into a box with a roach monitor in it to catch any hidden travelers.

My boss thinks I‚Äòm overreacting and kept repeating that this is the kind of work we do.

I'm British and my wife is from Kenya. We've been married for 2 years now and are trying to go on our honeymoon. We haven't gone for personal reasons including loss of several family members including my own father which has taken an emotional toll.

  
We're going to the canary islands and 1 of the requirement for her as a Kenyan passport holder is 3 months of bank statements stamped by her bank. She banks with Lloyds and it has been one of the worst experience I've seen.

She went in for the first time and the bank staff started interrogating her as to where she's going and why, also where she'll be staying (wtf?). When she said its Spain, they said they don't do stamps for Spain only USA visas.

She went to another branch and they were happy to stamp it but she tends to move her salary once paid to our joint savings account as I cover all the bills and her salary goes to our savings only. So the bank statements stamped did not have the minimum ¬£800 in the account for proof of funds.

She went back in again today and another staff has stated they never do stamps and only some staff will stamp, others won't. One of the reasons given also is the fact ""the ink on the stamp will run out""

  
Meanwhile our joint savings is with Nationwide. Not only did Nationwide offer to stamp everything including her forehead but they also did it with a smile and offered her a coffee. 

  
Will an eletronically stamped bank statement from Lloyds be sufficient as that's the only thing she's now been given?

Hopefully this helps someone else.

So last night I have the equivalent of 3 shots of Gin, which is a lot but also not a crazy amount so I am surprised I had this reaction. The weirdest part is that I literally did nothing. I had a long day at work cause we had to travel and literally just sat down and watched Transformers 1.  I drank the drink pretty quickly , with the first being a double shot and the second a single shot maybe within an hour. 

By 10pm the buzz was pretty much fading already and I started my routine post drinking which is to chug water and eat some rice.

Woke up at like 3am which isn‚Äôt super unusual but I usually just go get some water and then back to bed. But just couldn‚Äôt sleep and I felt like there was a hole in my chest. I was like completely aware that there was nothing anxiety inducing but it felt like I just couldn‚Äôt relax and felt like I was radiating body heat.

Anyway by 8am gave up on sleep and went downstairs to try and fix this. Grabbed a cup of coffee and started chugging water again. Then I drank my morning cup of psyllium husk. It was closer to 10am and the psyllium husk actually helped in my opinion. Not completely just got me a lot more relaxed. I  was working from home today but still didn‚Äôt want this to distract me too much cause I had to code.

Finally at around 1pm I had my first meal of the day. Which helped even more, I also walked around a bunch and went up and down the stairs. This got my blood flowing and I think that‚Äôs what finally got me through it. Now it‚Äôs evening time and I am feeling a bit sleepy already and will probably head to bed soon.

Now, almost eight years later, she basically has a dream life.

We talk pretty sporadically, fairly often. Only sporadically because he works farther away from where he lives I believe offshore, so he's pretty busy a lot of the time. I met him when he drunk texted me one night. He's one of my friend's brother-in-law. I don't really know what to make of the situation. He has pretty clearly flirted with me before, being suggestive, but not vulgar. He's a sweet guy, but the thing is he's kinda short with me. Like his responses are never very long, but yet he still messages me fairly often. We've met once, and he seemed attracted enough to me. He hugged me twice when I got there and once before I left. We had planned to get coffee the day after I got off work, but he ended up having to help his brother with something. I just don't know if I should ask for clarification on why he keeps talking to me? Because I won't lie, in the beginning, I didn't see him as much of a romantic interest, but as time has gone, I've become more fond of him. I'd really like to know what his intentions are with me, but I'm also slightly afraid of overstepping boundaries and ruining what we already have. At the same time, his behavior is pretty confusing to me. I'd really like some insight on this. Thanks!",1,1729672521.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It is self-service bakery. So you take the stuff you want on your tray and pay at the end. You can take-away but there is also limited seating space. As I was about to check-out, the cashier asked a woman that was sitting there if she had already paid for her coffee or not. The woman was responding very aggressively that she had already paid with another cashier before. She started yelling for the other cashier. The cashier¬† I was about to pay at told her there is no need to scream, he will handle it. The woman continued screaming. The other cashier finally turned up from the back room and told that the woman had paid, everything was fine. The woman, however, continued to scream and insult the cashier. He then told her to leave the bakery. She continued yelling and it got intensively worse. She now shouted direct death threats at him (You're days are counted! I do what I want!).¬†



As I left, the bakery I saw this woman standing there and I decided to tell her that I think it is not ok to express such threats. You cannot threatening killing someone over something like this. I could not have involved but it was so much over the top that I thought I had to say something. I told her even if she was right about having paid there is no excuse at all for threatening someone. If the cashier made a mistake, she could have argued calmly or tried to be the better person. She screamed and said she does what the wants and nobody can tell her what to do. I said that is a child's response and society does not work like that. You can't just do what you want. She proceeded mimicking me and said I shouldn't lecture her on how society works, she does what she wants. I finally told her I am going to work and she probably wasn't (yeah that was snippy I know).



I am not sure if she has a mental illness or was drunk. She apparently was not ""in best shape"", as you could say. So maybe I should just have ignored as there was no immediate danger. AITA?",1,1729672375.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.67,False

I think I completed phase 5 at around 120h - not rushing anything anyway and getting things done one after the other. I never needed more than 50 GW of power so my rocket fuel power plant was way sufficient.

I gave a try after phase 5 completion on Nuclear, got more power than ever need and was pilling up nuclear waste. So I turned it off (btw using remote switch on the water pump so it stop Nuclear plant from running)

Then create plutonium rod factory to clean this uranium waste and finally did another HFM factory for fun.

A lot this thanks to the tips form that community so thank you!

some learnings for me:

\- blueprint are awesome ! it forces me to thing vertical so I all made little factories all stackable (up to motor) (and a little cage for wildlife is good :))

\- sloop make things easier, at the beginning to double biomass, biofuel, power shard and obviously at the end for phase 4/5 parts (if you have power) ..  and overclock too

\- mercer sphere ""cloud"" depot are so good (too much?) - it helps so much

\- phase 5 is pretty easy when i think of it compare to phase 4

\- exploration is so much fun, beautiful and rewarding (and you need alt receipt!)

\- hypertube cannon and jetpack is all you need to move

I think I am done so... I started a fresh one in the desert :) - the only thing I wish to to be able to play this game on GFN mobile anywhere on 5G (although control would be a bit challenging) , unfortunately it is only available on Desktop.

Take care.

About 3 months into the relationship she asked him to move into her flat with her. I disapproved of the idea and she did understand and stopped it in its tracks once I voiced this. About 5 months in we moved away together for a job opportunity I got. We were in that location for 12 months and it was honestly really tough. She always wrote off the location, never tried to settle herself and also voiced how unhappy she was to me and people we had met there throughout the 12 months quite relentlessly. Some family things happened on my side which lead me to make the decision to move back home with family which she was very happy to do so. Throughout this time she hadn‚Äôt stopped talking to her ex which I have expressed on multiple occasions that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with them being so close. Talking about relationship issues on his side etc. once we moved back, they started to hang out more. See each other down the beach, have coffee together and she‚Äôs even gone around to his house multiple times and caught up over a coffee. She‚Äôs also gotten fairly mean, with little back handed comments becoming more and more regular. I put my foot down last night regarding them to which she responded they don‚Äôt normally affect me which I wasn‚Äôt impressed with. There has been a few occasions where her ex has been rude to me and she hasn‚Äôt really had my back pulling him up on the shitty behaviour.

They have also made it hard to pursue careers goals during our relationship and have been negative while doing so. Would like some advice on what I should do.

A sense of comfort i'd never really felt in another person before. We immediately clicked and it felt like all of lifes problems didn't really matter anymore.

Fast forward to ""that"" night where the inevitable happened. The risk I took was calculated but boy am I bad at math. A complete misread of the situation lead to me needing time alone to deal with my feelings. This killed you inside, even if I was blackout drunk, hurting you like that stuck with me the entirety of our time apart.

Over the next few days my mind was rushing with thoughts but the one constant in the back of my head was ""if you love them let them go and if they return then they were meant for you.""

I decided to give dating another go. Organised my first date and as if the universe had told you about it. I get a message completely out of the blue asking to catch up for coffee. I agreed to catch up because I did miss the connection we had and felt the need to apologise for how our last interaction played out.

Ever since we reconnected as ""just friends"" our lives have been completely intertwined, we do everything together. Whenever i'm not at work it seems i'm with you. All the adventures and late night calls. The connection we share is something i've never had in my life with any of my relationships, platonic or romantic.

Then there's me just sitting here catching those same feelings I had in the first place all over again. I've tried to fight them to no avail. They just keep creeping in after every interaction. I keep telling myself i'm stupid for feeling this way and knowing your situation so deeply just makes me feel even more stupid.

The thing is you are the kind of person i'm willing to wait for. It's not as if my emotional needs aren't being met when we are together. The chemistry we have is so unique that it already feels we are in a relationship just not labelling it as such. 

All of this is neglecting to mention the signs the universe keeps throwing at us when we are together. The synchronisities that just keep showing up only strengthen my hearts case. I feel like it's only a matter of time before you realise this too. 

Maybe one day you will see it the way I see it but until then I hope I can continue to be your safe person and showing you the love you have always desired from a relationship stands right in front of you waiting patiently to be ushered in.

I want to address a common confusion that many MBA aspirants face: choosing between the GMAT and GRE. Having experienced both exams, I‚Äôd like to clear up some misconceptions and share my challenging journey with the GRE, particularly my interactions with certain online communities.

1. **The GMAT is the Gold Standard**: Most MBA candidates begin their journey with the GMAT, as it is considered the benchmark for MBA admissions. However, after a few attempts, those who struggle to reach their target score often consider switching to the GRE, as it is perceived to be slightly easier. It‚Äôs important to note that while admissions committees claim they don't differentiate between the two exams, a strong GMAT score is often viewed more favorably. The GMAT‚Äôs reputation as a tougher test can give it a subtle edge in the admissions process.
2. **Switching Exams Isn‚Äôt Always the Solution**: I‚Äôve written a detailed post on how I initially wasted time preparing for the GRE before ultimately returning to the GMAT. With the right guidance and discipline, I achieved my target score. If you‚Äôre struggling with the GMAT, I suggest focusing on finding the right support rather than immediately switching to another exam.
3. **My Experience with the GRE Subreddit**: I posted about my GRE experience on the GRE subreddit and shared critiques of certain moderators. Unfortunately, my posts were deleted, and I felt silenced by Vince (a GRE mod) and an associate of Greg. Initially, I appreciated GregMat‚Äôs teaching style, but I was disappointed by the authoritarian moderation style on the subreddit. Greg frequently emphasizes his low fees (less than a cup of coffee), but I‚Äôve had private tutoring sessions with GMAT experts like Marty at affordable rates during tough times without them ever boasting about it.
4. **Lack of Constructive Criticism**: Greg and Vince appear unable to handle criticism. They often present their services as a kind of charity, yet they ban users who share dissenting opinions or criticisms (as happened with several of my posts). My experience with the GMAT community was different‚Äîafter I called out a GMAT expert (Shu) , he responded with a session to help me analyze my ESR, which was a genuinely kind gesture.
5. **Questionable Endorsements on the GRE Sub**: A friend of mine, who scored a 326 on the GRE using Magoosh, had never even heard of Greg or Vince. It feels like a false narrative has been built around their influence on the subreddit, and many high-scoring endorsements appear suspect‚Äîespecially when score screenshots aren‚Äôt provided. During Greg‚Äôs classes, I noticed a recurring pattern: the same individuals, with the same questions, participating for years. It made me question the authenticity of the hype.
6. **A Teacher‚Äôs Role Should Be Supportive**: Educators should be empathetic and open to feedback. It's not about boasting about their own scores or how low their fees are; it's about genuinely supporting students. True mentorship means listening, adapting, and guiding students through their unique challenges rather than simply showcasing their own achievements.
7. **Criticism Isn‚Äôt the Problem‚ÄîIt‚Äôs the Response**: My posts offering honest guidance to MBA aspirants considering the GRE were deleted, seemingly because those posts threatened their business model. It‚Äôs unfortunate to see a community meant to help students stifling open discussions.
8. **Final Thoughts**: I‚Äôm not saying the GRE is inherently a bad test, but the behavior and moderation style of certain GRE experts should be openly addressed. Greg and Vince, there are plenty of high scorers out there who don‚Äôt react negatively to criticism. As a 100th percentile scorer myself, I hope this perspective is valuable to other aspirants.

In the end, if you're struggling with the GMAT, don‚Äôt lose hope. With perseverance and the right guidance, you can reach your goals. Switching exams might seem like a shortcut, but sticking with the GMAT can ultimately pay off.",6,1729671566.0,GMAT,4,1.0,False
