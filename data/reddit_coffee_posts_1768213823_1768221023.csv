1qatlfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ouraring/comments/1qatlfo/multiple_bugs_step_count_duplicate_activity_cards/,"Multiple bugs: step count, duplicate activity cards, incorrect activity suggestions","Want to share my recent struggles, didn't find the post about any of them. I just want to vent and share my experience haha

**1. Step count is overestimated.** Previously, step tracking felt more accurate. Recently, the app records steps that clearly did not happen.

Current behavior: Minimal movement is logged as a significant number of steps.

Example: After waking up, I only walked briefly around the kitchen and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, yet the app recorded 110 steps. This is incorrect and does not reflect my actual movement.

Today all I did was make a coffee, brush my teeth, knit and watched a video about why Taylor Swift is a narcissist haha but Oura thinks I was dancing for some reason + counted 1630 steps.

**2. Duplicate activity confirmation cards.** Previously, detected activities required a single confirmation.

Current behavior: The same activity is shown multiple times as separate “Confirm activity” cards. After confirming one card, another identical card for the same activity appears.

As a result, one activity may need to be confirmed 4–5 times before the next detected activity becomes visible. For example, if I ran, then walked, then danced, and opened the app afterward, all activities are detected, but each one appears multiple times and must be confirmed repeatedly due to duplicated cards in the interface.

It's so annoying that if I was not paying attention, I then need to remove duplicates from the timeline. And the timeline starts glitching also when I tap on View full timeline

**3. Activities suggested when no activity occurred.** Previously, activity suggestions appeared only when there was actual movement or exercise.

Current behavior: The app suggests logging activities even when I was inactive.

Example: Yesterday I spent the entire day at home, did no workouts, and barely walked, yet I received two notifications prompting me to confirm some activity, despite not having done any.

Going back to previous issue: Today all I did was make a coffee, brush my teeth, knit and watched a video about why Taylor Swift is a narcissist haha but Oura thinks I was dancing for some reason + counted 1630 steps.

Support answered that 1 and 2 are known issues, and suggested soft reboot (whish did not help).

I appreciate their supportive words, but there is no clarity — when these issues will be fixed, and how I’ll know that they are fixed. Right now, I’m left in uncertainty and anxiety about the reliability of my data.

I decided not to renew my subscription until these problems are resolved and I can trust the data again.

And it is definitely not about sacrificing your mental health to a bedtime routine that requires a white noise machine, three books, one specific song, a particular angle of rocking, and the emotional stability of a monk.

Written with honesty, humor, and zero shame, this book says the quiet part out loud: chronic sleep deprivation makes you a worse version of yourself.

Most people still build PowerPoint decks as if the goal is to say everything they know. Slide after slide of context, charts, and explanations that make sense only to the presenter.

1qat5uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1qat5uf/i_am_tomura_shigaraki/,I... Am... Tomura Shigaraki?,"I wanted to make an experiment :P

every single moment Tomura closed his eyes to try and get even a little sleep, Stinger's voice echoed in his mind like a broken record, the voice that had shattered his arrogance into a thousand pieces.

He had believed those internet rumors that Stinger Stingray hated All Might; and for a moment he thought that maybe he could have recruited him for the League and had a strong ally for his cause... he was wrong.

When the giant water hand had grabbed him and slammed him against the ground... it was frightening... it terrified him... he wanted to run... he wanted to cry in All For One's arms even if All For One affection was a total zero.

He didn't want to sleep.

Stinger Stingray hadn't been so bad when he'd handed him over to Tartarus; he looked at him and was actually quite kind.

""Take him to the psychological ward... if you take him to the prison ward, they'll eat him alive."" Stinger had said this as he left without looking at Tomura.

The door opened, revealing the therapist assigned by Tartarus, a short, plump woman with glasses and a folder in her hand. She was a Spanish immigrant named Marisol.

""Do you need help, Tomura? Your bracelet was making quite a racket."" Marisol smiled like a mother as she approached Tomura.

""I'm just... scared."" Tomura said as Marisol placed her hand on his arm.

""It's okay, it's okay, tell me. I'm here for you."" Marisol smiled as she gestured for Tomura to sit down when Tomura looked at her his mind replayed the scene on his mind.

""Are you the only imbecile in this damn world who can distinguish between good and evil? Look at society outside your damned navel and see that we ALL have stories, and many of us have MORE THAN ENOUGH REASONS to be villains. WE HAVE REASONS, but we don't do it because we know we can't be worse to those who are worse off than us."" that monologue was stuck on Tomura head.

Meanwhile, in the Tartarus prison wing, the villains arrested at the USJ sat in the mess hall. A chameleon and a minotaur were sharpening rudimentary knives they had made themselves.

""If that idiot hadn't hidden that brat in the psychiatric ward,"" hissed the chameleon. ""I could be savoring his organs right now. That ill-mannered little shit thought he was our fucking boss that day."" The minotaur simply cracked his knuckles. They wanted revenge on the kid who had led to their arrest during the USJ attack.

Makoto's voice echoed through Stinger's phone. He was her agent, her eyes and ears, while she was in the United States with Koichi.

""The psychiatric ward is expensive, Haruka. You don't have that kind of money,"" came the voice through Stinger's phone.

Stinger, sipping coffee in All Might's apartment, remained unfazed.

""I know. But that Tomura Shigaraki they're trying to portray as a dangerous being is a fake... he's just a broken kid inside. All Might, will cover the bill; I don't think it'll really affect his wallet,"" Stinger said, taking a sip of coffee as he turned his attention to other object on All Might apartment.

""Do you still have that old photo?"" Stinger asked, looking at a photo in a rather expensive gold frame. It was the second photo of All Might that All Might cherished so much that he had it framed in gold. After all, that photo deserved such treatment; friendships worth their weight in gold should be protected with something equally valuable.

""I already have an idea of whom to look for... and please come with me because I'm terrible at this."" Toshinori said, looking at the photo of himself and his squad of children staring at the five-year-old Midrydrone before she was confined to a wheelchair.

He had stopped speaking to her and ended their relationship because he felt guilty for dragging her into the conflict and for All For One leaving her wheelchair-bound for life.

A part of Toshinori's heart still loved her.

All Might, that number one hero, possesses all the money in the world, he could buy a country if he wanted... but he lives in the worst emotional misery of all.",2,1768219561.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

1qat5ec,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPGDistributors/comments/1qat5ec/from_notebooks_to_actual_dataand_boy_were_we/,"From notebooks to actual data(and boy, we're we wrong about Tom","

I manage a beverage distribution company - about 8 field reps covering the metro area and surrounding towns. For years we did everything the """"old school"""" way. Reps kept notebooks, called in orders, and at the end of the week everyone would send me these handwritten activity reports that honestly looked like grocery lists.
The thing that finally broke me wasn't even the inefficiency. It was Tom.
Tom had been with us for maybe 18 months. Nice guy, always polite, but his weekly reports were... sparse. Like, really sparse. """"Visited 6 accounts, took 3 orders"""" type stuff. Meanwhile, guys like Rick were sending me these detailed multi-page reports about every conversation, every display they set up, every promotional idea they pitched. I'm looking at Rick's reports thinking this guy's crushing it, and looking at Tom's thinking he's barely trying.

We had a territory rebalancing meeting and I was this close to putting Tom on a performance improvement plan. Actually had the conversation with my boss about it. """"Tom's numbers are okay but his activity levels are terrible. Rick's running circles around him.""""
Then we implemented this field sales tracking system. Mostly because our order accuracy was garbage and we kept having pricing disputes. But it had GPS tracking and visit logging built in.
First week with the new system, I'm looking at the dashboard and something's... off.
Tom logged 47 customer visits that week. Rick logged 19.

I thought it was a glitch. Checked the GPS trails. Tom's literally zigzagging across his territory like he's running a marathon. He's hitting convenience stores, small restaurants, the random accounts everyone forgets about. Meanwhile Rick's visiting the same 15 big accounts over and over.

Turns out Tom's """"sparse"""" reports weren't because he was lazy - dude just hated paperwork and would scribble the bare minimum to satisfy the reporting requirement. But he was out there grinding. Hitting 8-10 accounts a day while Rick was spending 2 hours at each of his country club customer visits having coffee and chatting.
The best part? When I pulled the actual sales data, Tom's territory had grown 23% year-over-year. Rick's was up 4%. We'd been looking at the wrong metrics the entire time because all we had were these bullshit handwritten reports.
I felt like an idiot. Almost put our best performer on a PIP because his paperwork skills sucked.

1qasyjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qasyjk/how_to_find_roast_date_from_supermarket_beans/,How to find roast date from supermarket beans that often only have best before date.,"For a quick answer check my comment. For longer and more accurate explanation read the following:
There are a few options for this. The best is of course getting lucky with:
A) Asking an employee when they got the shipment. As supermarkets often use cheaper shipping methods, estimate ~3 days before that for the roast date

B) Check beans from the same company on nearby shelves and pray that there is a roast date. Assume around the same time as supermarkets often buy from companies in one big shipment, not when they run out.

You can also take a more methodical approach at this, such as:
A) Watching the stock. Always try to buy beans after they have just been restocked

B) looking at current stock. If you can see some from the same company are really empty and some are quite full, but with the same best before date, that can be quite a good sign. It means that the supermarket regularly purchases beans to keep up with the demand of one popular stock but therefore always has full shelves of the other types from the same company. You can also reach to the back of the shelf and if there is a change in best before date, also great sign. The bigger the change, generally the fresher.

C)If you regularly buy the same beans you can also compare how solid the bag feels. If it suddenly feels harder to compress the air inside than regularly, leave that bag. Beans release carbon dioxide even in their original package so this is a sign of old stock.

And now (no I don’t know why this is last) the methods I’ve had the most success with:
A) You can usually find a code in form of B 123456 01:00. It’s in form Batch YY/MM/DD and time of roast. It may vary from companies but at least in QLD (that’s in Australia for all the Americans out there) it is fairly common.

B) looking around the package looking for any indication of what batch it is. You can often run them through Intelligence Chatbots if they have a non intuitive layout but often with some reasoning you can find the hidden date in the code.

C) This isn’t the best method but it is good for a glance and I have used a few times with decent success. Best before dates are often in factors of 6 or 12 months in the future. My regular beans are about 18 months after roast date (absurd, really) but it can help to see an approximate date of when it was roasted. If there is a closer best before date than 18 months it is almost always in the form of whole months. E.g. if it were 2024, 19 march, and best before date was 2024, 28 June, I can assume it was roasted on 28 of April as that was the last time it was the 28 of a month.

One more thing. Avoid bulk ordering supermarkets like Costco. Cheap ones usually have decent beans like Aldi but if you know they order in bulk then try to avoid coffee from them.

So good!,"So I have been a longtime Bialetti user, but like many with Italian relatives and friends it was always limited to often burnt bitter dark roasts without really paying attention to the potential of a Bialetti machine when paired with fresh beans and a solid grinder and a decent Bialetti technique. 

Then I spent the last couple of years dialing in my process with a few random videos on YouTube about the Venus, with my cheap Bosch blade grinder. Better than bitter coffee, but still simply decent.

Then this holiday season I geeked out over YouTube videos of a Cafelat Robot and - quite apprehensive to spend a small fortune for coffee - I started wondering how much could my Bialetti coffee improve, so I grabbed a K6 grinder, which showed up two days ago. I tried it with some old beans and already there I was floored at the difference in tastes from my Bosch.

Then I received a couple of fresh lightly roasted beans with modern flavour profiles (from Tanat in Paris) this morning and wow what a difference! The bag described itself as “Violette — Fraise — Muffins aux myrtilles” (Violet — Strawberry — Blueberry Muffins). Before brewing I thought to myself how good can this bag really be? Well…let’s just say I had never tasted any coffee like this before; without sugar the hints of violet popped most, but a little sugar brought the strawberry flavour out to the point I thought I was drinking strawberry coffee, and a bit more sugar I felt like I was drinking a liquid blueberry muffin. Genuinely impressed! 

To be clear: I am not paid by anyone whatsoever and the bags were a birthday gift - I was shocked at how expensive they were initially (€22 / 100 g!!) -so there is no way I am buying it regularly, but as a present I am still blown away I was able to make this in a Venus, when I grew up knowing only the smell of burnt dark roasts.

We’re down to Twickenham and Northfields as potential places to move as they are about a 15 mins drive from my family.

But now we’re a bit confused about what we want and jumping on here for any advice or tips which could help us set them apart. We’ll be renting first and then buying as soon as we are able to (banks willing to lend mortgages etc.). We think our budget will be about £900k. Both areas have 3 bed houses within our budget, with good primary and secondary schools nearby.

The key difference I’m seeing between the two is that in Northfields we’re likely to be in a hustle-bustle area, a bit more tight spaced (less parking - which matters somewhat for family visits), but also a decent high st with good coffee shops, cafes and better commuting options.

Whereas Twickenham seems more leafy and posh, we’d have access to Richmond across the river but we’d not be able to purchase right near the high st but a bit further away towards Crane park or Fulwell even. The playgrounds aren’t as abundant either.

If you have experience of living in either area, especially as a family, is there something we should consider about either of the two that we have not so far? We know our life won’t be set up like Copenhagen (cycling everywhere, 10 min commutes to work, brilliant coffees and pastries at our doorstep 😅) so we’re not quite sure which would be better to move to make the best of a London family life.

Which would you choose? We’ll be a mix of wfh/going to offices in Holborn (3x per week) and Waterloo (once a week).

I think this is a pretty positive, “girl go for it!” spread, but I’m still pretty new to tarot, so I’d love to hear thoughts from more experienced readers. Thank you! <3

My interpretation:

1 & 2 - What does he think of me?
Seven of Swords and Strength immediately jumped out together. I took Seven of Swords to mean that he thinks I’m pretty quick-witted, smart, and a little bit sly, I might have an ulterior motive (whenever we’re together the main thing we do is banter and jab at each other so that checks out). And for Strength, I’m grounded and secure in myself, able to play with fire a bit and in touch with my more intense side.

3 - Should I ask him out?
I read Queen of Pentacles as yes, but keep it grounded, don’t leap too quickly without thinking. Keep it simple and on common ground, and there is opportunity for growth there.

4 - Any advice for asking him out?
Ace of Wands, just go for it while I have the opportunity. There’s passion there, we’ve already laid the groundwork with a shared workspace, but play into the more passionate aspect of the relationship (outside of work, of course). Even if it doesn’t end up romantic, there’s still a very fun friendship to be had.

I need to seriously change my life. I have so much anxiety about everything that I can’t do anything. So a little about me I’m currently doing a masters degree in counselling it is online for all the class work with an in person practicum that I haven’t started yet. I work full time as a youth care worker in a group home. I just got married and my husband works full time but we have completely different hours and days off so we hardly see each other.
 I have a lot of things going on right now and I’m feeling so burnt out. My lifestyle needs a complete overhaul I don’t take care of myself at all because I’m so tired from everything else and worrying about everything. I work 4pm-12am so my sleep is wrecked I go to bed around 3 or  4am most nights and sleep until like 12pm. I know I should go to bed earlier but I just feel like I need that time to unwind after work. My diet is also a mess I eat once a day at 2am when I get home from work and I eat too much. I will have one coffee on my way to work as well. When I wake up at 12 I usually get ready,do some school work, then go to work. On my days off I usually do school work, fit in appointments, and see friends if they are free my days off are Tuesday Wednesday so most people are at work. 
I understand the right things to do to improve my life and mental health like having better sleeping habits and a healthier diet and eating consistently throughout the day. But I don’t have the will power to change my life I’m just so exhausted all the time. My husband has been supportive but I can tell he feels my stress. He also is a bit frustrated because a lot of the house work falls on him and I feel so guilty that I don’t help enough. My mental health is so bad. I do see a counsellor but like nothing truly eases the anxiety.
What can I do because this isn’t it?

**Food & Drink**

* Coffee (regular café, small cup): 12–20 ILS ($3–5)
* Cappuccino or specialty coffee: 18–28 ILS ($5–7)

\*Buy from small local cafés or bakeries instead of tourist spots; chains like Aroma or Cofix have lower prices.

* Beer (local, 0.5L in a bar): 25–40 ILS ($7–11)
* Meal at an inexpensive restaurant: 50–80 ILS ($13–22)
* Three-course meal at a mid-range restaurant: 150–300 ILS ($40–80)
* Street food (falafel, shawarma): 15–35 ILS ($4–9)

\*lunchtime specials are 20-30% cheaper, ask about it before you order

**Groceries (per item)**

* Loaf of bread: 8–12 ILS ($2–3)
* Milk (1 liter): 6–10 ILS ($1.50–3)
* Eggs (dozen): 12–20 ILS ($3–5)
* Cheese (1 kg): 50–80 ILS ($13–22)
* Chicken breast (1 kg): 35–60 ILS ($9–17)
* Apples / Bananas (1 kg): 10–15 ILS ($3–4)

\*Shop at cheaper chains like Rami Levy, Victory, or Shufersal Deal. Skip chains like AM PM, Super Yuda or convenience stores

**Transportation**

* Bus / light rail ride in Tel Aviv/Jerusalem: 6–7 ILS ($1.50–2)
* Taxi start fare: 12–15 ILS ($3–4) + \~5 ILS/km ($1.30/km)
* Car rental: 200–350 ILS/day ($55–90), depending on the car type

\*Don't book a non-central hotel before checking that you can easily get to the main places by public transportation. The Tel Aviv metro is under construction and there is only one line. If you are not on the line, the time and money you will spend on bus and taxi rides is not worth it.

**Accommodation**

* Budget hostel / guesthouse: 100–200 ILS/night ($28–55)
* Mid-range hotel: 400–700 ILS/night ($110–190)
* Luxury hotel: 900+ ILS/night ($250+)

\*After you have seen the hotel on sites like Booking/Expedia etc. go to the hotel's official website and book at a lower price. I would even email the hotel to ask for a personal discount that is not advertised on the website.

**Entertainment & Attractions**

* Museum entry: 40–70 ILS ($11–19)
* Cinema ticket: 45–60 ILS ($12–16)
* Tours (day trips, guided): 200–400 ILS ($55–110)

\*There are tour operators that publish coupon codes, this can save you about 10-15% off. All you have to do is type in Google: ""company name"" + coupon code

Israel is generally expensive, especially in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Street food, local bakeries, and small markets are usually the most budget-friendly options. Tourist spots, trendy restaurants, and imported goods can feel pricey.

1qasd2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1qasd2c/bali_sample_5day_itinerary_budget_breakdown/,BALI Sample 5-Day Itinerary & Budget Breakdown,"Hey there, Travel Trotters! 👋 Ever dreamed of a Bali escape that blends ancient temples, lush rice paddies, stunning waterfalls, and vibrant beach vibes without breaking the bank? Well, I’ve just poured over some fantastic insights to craft a practical 5-day itinerary and budget breakdown that's perfect for your next adventure. Get ready to soak up the sun and culture! 🌴✨

First things first, getting around Bali efficiently is key to maximizing your time. While public transport exists, it's not ideal for sightseeing. For solo explorers, joining group tours can work, though availability can be a bit hit or miss. The golden ticket for groups (even just 2-3 people, but especially 4+) is chartering a private car with a driver. It's incredibly flexible and, surprisingly, the most cost-effective option when you split the fare! Just remember, car charter rates typically cover the vehicle and driver, so budget separately for entrance fees, parking, and tolls. Drivers are pros at getting you to the spots, but usually won't join you inside attractions. Alternatively, pre-arranged tours often bundle these costs, which can be convenient if you prefer a hands-off approach.

Let's dive into the adventure!

Your journey kicks off in **Central Bali** on **Day 1**, setting up base in Ubud. After arriving and getting your airport transfer sorted, you could find yourself marveling at the thrilling Blangsinga Glass Bridge, feeling the spray of Tegenungan Waterfall (it can get busy, so be prepared!), and making some new, mischievous friends at the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. Don't miss a food stop at Warung Mak Beng for some legendary fried fish and fish head soup – trust me on this!

**Day 2** takes you to the spiritual heart of **East Bali**, and for the truly dedicated, this day starts *early* – think 2:30 AM! Why? To beat the crowds at Lempuyang Temple, home to the iconic ""Gate of Heaven"" shot. It's totally worth it for that serene, once-in-a-lifetime photo! You'll also explore the stunning water gardens of Tirta Gangga, discover the unique sun-drenched Tukad Cepung Waterfall, and wander through the emerald terraces of Tegalalang. Lunch might be part of a tour, but for dinner, Warung Pondok Madu in Ubud is a solid pick for BBQ pork ribs.

**Day 3** is often a favorite, guiding you through the picturesque **North Bali**. This day is a scenic feast for the eyes! Snap a picture at the mystical Handara Gate (usually less crowded than Lempuyang!), then head to the tranquil Ulun Danu Beratan Temple, seemingly floating on Lake Beratan. Cool off at the Banyumala Twin Falls, a quieter spot with natural pools perfect for a swim. Cap it off with breathtaking views from Wanagiri Hidden Hill, famous for its swings and photo platforms, before admiring the vast, UNESCO-listed Jatiluwih Rice Terraces.

**Day 4** blends more spiritual exploration with a change of scenery. After checking out of your Ubud hotel, you'll visit Tirta Empul Temple for its holy spring purification ritual, then perhaps indulge in some authentic Babi Guling (spit-roasted suckling pig) at Babi Guling Bu Desak Pejeng. Next up are the beautiful Taman Ayun Temple and, as the day draws to a close, the magnificent Tanah Lot sea temple – absolutely unmissable at sunset! You'll then check into your accommodation in Seminyak, ready for beachside relaxation.

Finally, **Day 5** is all about a relaxed exploration of **Kuta** before your departure. After a leisurely morning and checking out (you can usually leave luggage at your hotel), head to Kuta for some souvenir hunting at Kuta Art Market, a stroll along Kuta Beach to watch the surfers, or a coffee break at Beachwalk Shopping Center. Grab some local eats for lunch, and if time permits before your airport transfer, maybe even a sweet treat.

Now, let's talk numbers! For a comfortable trip, a buffer is always smart. For two people sharing, you're looking at roughly IDR 5,751,000 (around USD 343) per person. This covers hotels, the Bali Tourist Levy, private transfers/charters, most entrance fees, parking, food, and driver tips. However, the real budget magic happens with larger groups! For four people sharing, by smartly opting for car charters over individual tours, your costs can drop significantly – think around IDR 4,153,250 (roughly USD 248) per person! These estimates exclude flights, travel tax, and, of course, your shopping sprees!

A couple of final pro-tips: always consider travel insurance for peace of mind, and keep an eye out for promo codes on hotels or tours.

# Weather & This Week's Outlook:

Cold but quiet this Monday morning with temps in the teens after last night's snow squalls wrapped up. Expect some early sun before light snow showers arrive this afternoon and evening, though valley accumulation stays minimal. Tuesday warms up near 40 and stays mostly dry before a clipper brings rain and snow showers late Tuesday night into Wednesday. Enjoy the mildness while it lasts because another arctic blast arrives Thursday and Friday, dropping highs back into the teens with lows hovering around zero.

# SOME of what's in this week's news:

* Gov. Phil Scott devoted his entire State of the State to education reform, threatening to veto any budget that deviates from Act 73's mandate to consolidate Vermont's 119 school districts down to fewer than 25
* Vermont ranks dead last nationally for economic momentum according to the Vermont Futures Project, driven by population loss, an aging workforce, and a housing shortage that's seen prices jump 61% in five years
* Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth is floating controversial school spending caps for 2028 and 2029, drawing ""deep concerns"" from House Democrats and pushback from the School Boards Association
* Burke Mountain Academy grad Mikaela Shiffrin has pushed her World Cup total to 106 wins after recovering from her brutal Killington crash, heading into next month's Olympics in Italy
* South Burlington's long awaited pedestrian bridge over I-89 at Exit 14 could finally break ground this spring after the city secured council authorization to request additional state funding
* Senate Democrats are advancing bills to restrict ICE arrests at schools, hospitals, and shelters, with Phil Baruth betting Burlington and Winooski will see raids within the year
* South Burlington students are pushing legislation that would give student reps binding votes on school board decisions, with Rep. Leanne Harple set to sponsor the bill

But when you raised your hands up to fix your hair today, i couldn't see a kind stranger, for a split second, i saw her. I saw my stepmom. I saw the woman who raised me with a heavy hand and a heart full of hate.

You smiled at me, but my body went cold. I immediately braced myself for the impact. I expected the pain. I expected the shouting. I expected the feeling of being small and trapped in a house where ""discipline"" was just a word for her, to use the belt, taking her anger out on me.

She taught me that wisdom and age just mean you know how to hurt someone more efficiently. She left bruises on me that faded years ago, but the way she looked at me, with that pure disgust, is still burned into my eyes.

I hate that she still wins. I hate that i’m 22 and drowning in loneliness because I’m terrified of the very thing I need.

But every time i get close, every time i feel that pull toward a woman, who reminds me of an authority figure, the fear chokes me.

I am so incredibly depressed. I spend my nights staring at the ceiling, wondering if I’m broken forever. I wonder if there is actually a woman out there who has that same strength, that same maturity, but who uses it to protect instead of destroy, to be kind. ",2,1768216604.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I am 36y Male, normal weight and quite active (playing tennis 3 times a week since 7 months). 

No smoke and no alcohol. Few to none coffee.

Last period is really stressful.

Lately (since 3 months) I am sleeping really bad and today it came to my mind that I might have to check my BP.

I woke up at 4am as I could not sleep and after 2h on the sofa I checked and the first reading was 135/88.

I soon got anxious.

I then checked again after some seconds and was 132/84 and the third one was 134/89

My wife suggested me to drink, wait a bit and re measure. Went to 126/81 and the last one I took was 123/76

Usually I am around 98-110/55-60.

Is that normal high values from this morning something I need to be worried about?

1qas65l,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1qas65l/help_chronic_insomnia_is_taking_over_my_life/,Help: Chronic Insomnia is taking over my life,"I’ve been dealing with some sort of insomnia ever since I was 18.  I am now 42.  My doctors don’t seem to know what to do at this point and it’s freaking me out.  There will be weeks where I don’t sleep a wink for 4+ days in a row.  I used to look forward to bedtime and for the last year have dreaded it.  Compound that with general anxiety disorder, ADHD (I only sometimes take immediate release adderall in the AM and no coffee after the morning) and hormone imbalances I am just now starting to address after 9 years of either doing IVF, pregnant, 4 rounds of IVF again, pregnant and now have 8 and 3 year old children.  
I follow almost all sleep “health” guidelines- cool dark room, sound machine, hot bath before bed, magnesium, even some crazy expensive mattress to regulate the heat in the bed and measure my heart rate and sleep times, etc.  I try and stay away from my phone or kindle but what is one supposed to do if they are in bed for 10+ hours and can’t sleep? It’s gotten so bad I often don’t even get in bed until 2-3am bc I’ve experienced so many sleepless nights where borderline psychosis and dark thoughts start to creep in that is freaks me out. And it’s just getting worse. Im 42 and feel 60. Continues brain fog, last hormone panel showed zero hormones as they were all going to support my adrenals.  Yes I’ve had/have chronic stress in my life but I’m not kept up thinking about it. It’s more a subconscious inability to cross the sleep threshold.  
I have tried every sleeping med out there. Side effects for non habit forming ones include nausea, trigger migraines and horrible grogginess the next day. Medications like ambien, even in high doses, don’t do it. I’ve been on benzodiazepines for so long they no longer are effective but more like maintenance to ward off the inevitable side effects of withdrawal that include…insomnia.  
To be clear my main issue is the initial falling asleep.  After having young kids you get used to mid night wakings and I never have a problem falling back to sleep after (this is assuming I was asleep before they woke at 3am).  It’s just like my body and mind won’t cross the threshold of sleep at night.  
A year ago the sleep meds worked and I remember getting in bed at a reasonable hour and falling asleep with my kids and I miss that so so much .  I now HAVE to sleep in some days to maintain sanity but that isn’t how I want to live my life and it’s not a great example for my kids, not good for mood, productivity or my work. But I’m suffering. 
I guess I want to know if anyone has experienced this level of insomnia before for this long and if there is anything else I should be doing.  
And yes, I know sleeping in doesn’t help for the following night.  But even when I run myself ragged with exercise and keeping up with the kids, I can’t recall the last time I yawned.  And yes, I know habit forming medications for anxiety or sleep are no intended for long term use.  So save that judgment please.  
Hypnosis?  CBT hasn’t ever helped. Are there sleep rehabs?  (Not kidding.).  It’s time I really address this head on as the impact it’s having on my life- and the long term impact it could have is frightening.   

Thank you for all that give feedback.  
Good night. ?  Maybe?  Fingers crossed? Yikes.  I’m so jealous of people who just get in bed and go to sleep.  I do not even recall what that feels like.

I think my husband may be going through a midlife crisis. I just want to mention that I am Polish (34) and he is Irish (38), in case any cultural differences may play a role and we met each other in the UK. We have been together for 10 years. For the last couple of months, he has been snappy and angry with me and this is getting worse. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I really love and adore him and treat him as my best friend, but it is difficult atm. I always try to do nice things for him: I cook from scratch exclusively for him, I clean and iron his work clothes, I wear nice clothes and makeup, keep in shape, exercise, and keep my hair long because he likes it. The only good thing is we are intimate 4–5 times a week, I initiate often, and I try to meet all his needs, but he also became 'intense' recently. I am emotionally stable and try to be calm about all of this. He refuses to talk about what is wrong. Recently, he has developed an odd preoccupation with his height (he is approx. 5'7""), which has suddenly become an issue for him and has an issue about getting bald and grey, but I tell him he is hot ' etc. to me but he does not believe me. He has also accused me several times of going out to see other men, which is not true. I only went for coffee with a female friend and even told him to come with me if he didn’t believe me. I know this sounds gross to write, but he also gets BJs for years from my initiative a few times a week, (I was told once this might be an issue not getting this but it was never a case) so that is not the issue either. He is only kind to me for 1–2 hours after this act, and then he becomes snappy and angry again. I am not sure what else I can do. He refuses to see a psychologist, and our finances are fine we both work. Anything else? Thank you for any suggestions.",1,1768216253.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Im standing there holding a bag of spinach completely confused. I ask her what shes talking about and she says her husband talks about me a lot and that she saw some texts between us that felt too friendly. I tell her the only texts Ive ever sent him are about work stuff or group lunch plans. Like literally nothing weird.

She says regardless I need to back off and be more professional because its affecting her marriage. I told her as respectfully as I could that if shes having issues with her husband thats something she needs to take up with him and not ambush me at the store. I said I havent done anything wrong and Im not going to apologize for being a normal coworker.

She got really upset and said I was being dismissive and that women should support other women. I said I do support women but Im not gonna accept blame for something I didnt do. I told her she should maybe check her husband if shes feeling insecure because Ive never crossed any lines.

Now Im paranoid that shes gonna show up at my job or something. I told one friend about it and she said I couldve been nicer but honestly I was blindsided and I dont think I said anything wrong.

1qarxb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1qarxb6/which_macbook_for_lightroom_usage/,Which MacBook for Lightroom Usage?,"Hey everyone,

My current PC is 14 years old - as soon as I launch Lightroom, CPU usage spikes to 100% - and after just a few clicks, I’m stuck waiting. Working with masks is especially painful - the brush lags so badly that it takes forever. I do have 32 GB of RAM - but usage usually stays between 11-18 GB.

I have heared that Lightroom runs really smooth on M-chip macs.

I save my edited photos to an external SSD.

Since I’m often on the go - I’m looking for a mobile solution to streamline and speed up my photo workflow. Right now, I spend more time waiting for Lightroom to respond than actually editing - and I’d love to change that.

Here’s my typical workflow:
- Sony a6700 (26 MP) - 100 photos per session
- Transfer to laptop - quick preview is important
- Select and flag photos for editing
- Apply AI Denoise depending on ISO
- Use sliders - AI masks (sky - architecture) - object detection
- Edit individual masks (currently almost impossible)
- Export final images

I don’t mind if import, export or denoise take a bit longer - I usually grab a coffee during that. What matters most is smooth editing - especially when working with masks and adjustments.

I don’t do video production or gaming - this laptop is purely for photo editing.

After researching here and elsewhere - I’m currently considering a MacBook Pro with the M4 chip - 32 GB RAM - and 1 TB SSD. I’m pretty sure it would handle my workflow easily - but I’m also wondering if it’s overkill and I’d never really push it to its limits.

So here are my questions:
- Which MacBook would you recommend for my workflow?
- Is the M4 Pro with 32 GB and 1 TB too much?

I would like to use the laptop for a long time and not buy a new model in a few years.

Hello.
I've been trying for the past like 3 years to get a game started with this setting. I think im just gonna give it one final try.

I'm usually a GM in DnD but this will be more free form narrative based youll be able to ask to do basically anything as long as it makes sense but that also makes it vital to understand what you can do, so there might be a lot of learning and questions asked on both sides . 

I have crafted this setting from the ground up, history, technology, factions and people. There are heavy influences from media i enjoy but i feel like ive brought enough novel input to make this a unique experience for people craving a more realistic take on the Cyberpunk genre.

I tend to obsess over details, craft and think and delve into my own imagination to create these places and the lives of the people inhabiting them but there's no meaning if there's no one to witness them. So i need real people to walk the streets , see the sights and get lost in the narative with me.

I will work with you on a character, exactly as you want them to be, rooted within the world to the best of my abilities. We will work together on a story you feel like expressing and then I'll set you free in a world of possibilities. Action, drama, subterfuge, highs and lows all at your fingertips as long as you're willing to look for them. I am very much the kind of DM that expects my players to be equal participants in telling the story , i will not railroad, force missions etc. I will make hooks , i will do my best to create opportunities but i need my players to be proactive in attempting to follow the story. This wont work if you try to turn your decision making off and play along.

Now , enough of that. Perhaps it is time to give you a taste of what life in my world is like through the eyes of a humble character. (And a bit of my writing, but do not worry, its my job as a GM to write long shit players can have shorter replies)

=======================

Mikail is a city police officer. His job used to involve maintenance on the robotic drones that patrol the inner city, but since the new overseer mark3 he's been left on wall duty.

""Perhaps it's for the best"" he thinks for himself, stepping over the rattling walkways precariously pinned to the outside of the massive structure. He sighs softly while looking down at the sheet metal face of the wall, the rusting rivets holding down all the poor patch jobs added throughout the years, threatening to pop at the slightest suggestion of force.

His job is simple, do rounds , make sure none of the Slumers try to get past the wall. He knows he's supposed to call them ""outer citizens"" and perhaps some of them deserve that distinction but anyone dumb enough to try to scale the wall is below that title in his mind. He stops for a second to think about what he's going to have for lunch, that cute barista from the place he frequents comes to mind but he's not going to ask her out. Not yet , maybe when he makes captain. So he settles for passing by there for another coffee as the sound of a gunshot echoes out and snaps him back to attention. 

He looks down to see a man slumped over on the ground right under him, being patted down by who clearly was the shooter. His instinct is to call a medical drone but he remembers being yelled at twice for interfering with ""outer citizen politics"" and proceeds with his rounds. 

He looks out at the vast buildings sprawling out in front of him, this new burst of construction in the outer city is intimidating, "" Command  , you sure block C4-22 is authorized for construction above 50 floors?"" he asks, receiving the same response they've always given. A firm yes, citing that it's far enough from the wall to not cause an issue. He keeps walking...

This is Mikail's life. Constantly on the edge of two worlds. One one side the inner city, white, clean, tidy, safe.On the other , filling his mind day and night the outer city, where every color of the rainbow lives, thrives or struggles, where cops get to go on patrol, where people need the help he cannot give, where everything he thinks he wants is, but her just goes back home.

I made basically this exact post a year ago, if you messaged then but didn't get in feel free to try again, hopefully we get this working this time. ",1,1768215198.0,RoleplayGroups,0,1.0,False

1qartez,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qartez,"Skip the Nanjing Road crowds: A local’s ""Secret"" Shanghai route for the best views (and it's all free)","Most first-timers in Shanghai head straight to Nanjing Road and the main Bund. But, if you want those iconic skyline photos without being pushed around too hard, you need to change your route.

As a local travel designer, this is the ""City Walk"" I usually take my guests on to see the real charm of Shanghai:

**1. The ""Hidden"" Bund Route (North Bund to Zhapu Road Bridge)**

* **Why:** Instead of fighting for a spot at the main Bund, walk from North Bund Green Land toward Zhapu Road Bridge.
* **The Shot:** The angle from Zhapu Road Bridge is the ""Chef's Kiss"" of Shanghai photography. You get the old European architecture in the foreground and the futuristic Lujiazui towers in the background. It’s perfect.

**2. 1000 Trees (The Viral Hotspot)**

* **The Vibe:** It’s a mall, but it looks like a hanging forest. Even if you aren't shopping, the architecture is stunning.
* **Expert Tip:** It's very photogenic from across the river. I usually bring my photography-loving clients here for a quick session before heading to Xintiandi.

**3. Xintiandi: Where 1920s meets 2026**

* **The Vibe:** This is the famous ""Shikumen"" style—grey brick houses and narrow alleys.
* **Expert Tip:** Don't just stay on the main shopping street. Get lost in the smaller side alleys to find the quietest cafes. It’s the perfect blend of colonial history and modern luxury.

**4. The ""Spirited Away"" Trick (Yuyuan Bazaar at Night)**

* **The Rule:** Never go to Yuyuan Bazaar during the day.
* **The Magic:** Go after 6:00 PM (in winter) when the lights turn on. It transforms into a scene from *Spirited Away*. It is the peak of Chinese aesthetics.
* **Bonus (Early 2026):** If you are visiting between Jan 26 and March 3, 2026, the Lantern Festival is a must. Head to Jiuqu Bridge (九曲桥) for the best lantern displays.

**5. The ""Golden Hour"" Shift (The Bund Light Show)**

* **The Vibe:** The Bund feels like two different cities during the day vs. at night. After dark, the colonial buildings light up in a warm gold that looks like 1920s jazz-age glamour.
* **Expert Timing Tip:** Most people don't know when the lights actually turn on. In the **winter, it’s usually 6:00 PM**. I always tell my clients to arrive at the bridge around 5:30 PM to watch the transition. It’s the most ""cinematic"" 30 minutes in Shanghai.
* **Best for:** Romantic walks and tripod photography.

 

I help travelers navigate the ""Last Mile"" of China travel. Whether you want a full custom itinerary, a professional guide to explain the history of the Bund buildings, or seamless transport (private vans) to get between these spots without the subway struggle, I’ve got you covered.

The cats are fed. Now I'm waiting for the coffee to finish brewing. Everything is calm at this time.

The air is a little cold. The apartment deeply quiet. No tension.

I've noticed that coffee hits differently if you add a small tea spoon of roasted cacao (French roast) to the coffee grind. 

I feel more focused and calmer compared to straight coffee.  I've been doing this for close to 5 months now. Going to stick with it.

1qarsgx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qarsgx,Tazo chai is really masala chai,"“Chai” means “tea” in the Indian subcontinent. A mixture of ground spices is called “masala,” which makes this Tazo chai — with cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, & [other] spices — a “masala chai”. 

I usually make my own masala chai with whole spices and loose black tea from a pack of Brooke Bond Taaza gifted by a friend from Bangladesh. This Tazo tea bag was a freebie when I bought some decaffeinated tea online. With this cold I have, I wanted a strong-tasting tea. 

Instructions were to steep for 5 minutes in 250 ml of boiling water. The result was indeed a strong-tasting tea, but not the way I know masala chai to be. It’s usually made with a lot of milk and I personally boil the tea directly in milk. The remedy was 2 teaspoons of Coffee-Mate and a sachet of Splenda.

It was nice, close-tasting, and convenient enough for me to try it again with the second bag some other time.",5,1768214971.0,tea,3,0.86,False

Everything felt heavier than it should’ve. Simple stuff took more effort and I kept telling myself I needed motivation or a better routine or to get serious again.

What I didn’t connect for a long time was how my mornings were setting the tone. I’d wake up and grab my phone without thinking. Notifications, random posts, stuff I didn’t even care about yet. Nothing dramatic but by the time I got out of bed my head already felt full. Like I’d started the day responding instead of waking up.

At some point I stopped scrolling in the morning almost by accident. Not as a challenge or a rule. I just left my phone in another room one night and didn’t bother grabbing it right away when I woke up. I made coffee, stared out the window for a bit, got ready slowly.

And the weird thing was… the day felt different. Not amazing Not productive in some intense way but just less tense. Like I wasn’t starting the day already behind.

After a few days of that, I noticed I wasn’t as exhausted by noon. Starting work didn’t feel like such a fight. I still procrastinated but it didn’t feel as desperate. My brain wasn’t fried before the day even started.

That helped my burnout more than any motivation hack I tried. Not because it fixed everything, but because it stopped me from draining myself first thing in the morning.

I still scroll I’m not anti-phone or anything. But mornings without it made me realize how much energy I was losing before I even did anything.

Turns out I didn’t need more motivation. I just needed to stop flooding my brain the moment I woke up.

Those aren’t the words you want to hear right after your 9th birthday. 
But no.

Now, I’m at a funeral, 2,000 kilometers away from my Barbie. I’m wearing a black dress and surrounded by old women and even older men who reek of whiskey and lustful thoughts.

Chapter 1: The Funeral
The funeral happened fast.
He was mourned, carried, and buried—just like that. It wasn’t a surprise to many when he took his own life. Not really. His wife had died just a few months earlier from breast cancer. His children never called, never visited, never even tried. He was alone.

And he was 68. He was bound to die sometime—sooner or later.
It’s just a shame that he had to go that way.
After the burial, we gathered—like families always do after death. We mourned. We comforted each other. And we ate. The eating is the most important part, of course. That lasted maybe 30 to 50 minutes.
Then came the lawyer.

The best part of a funeral, right?
The kids were sent out of the room, but we didn’t go far. We watched from the crack in the door while the adults gathered around the dining table like it was the kickoff to a football game. Everyone was wondering, What did we get?

The lawyer sat at the head of the table and explained that our grandfather had left behind two wills. He said he’d be reading both. And then, just like the NBA draft—or at least that’s how it felt to me as a 9-year-old—he started calling names.

First, he handed out personal letters written by the deceased. Some people opened theirs and shed a tear or two—maybe out of real emotion, or maybe just to make it look like they cared.

Uncle Peter didn’t even bother opening his. He just sat there, waiting for his name to be called.

After the formalities, the first will was read. I was still watching from the doorway when the lawyer cleared his throat. That’s when they caught me. My mom shot a sharp look at my dad, who was sitting on the other side of the room, and without a word, he got up and closed the door—locking it so I couldn’t spy anymore.

Defeated, I sat with the other kids, in a room filled with snot-nosed cousins, bad moods…
And no Barbie doll.

There was nothing to do but wait.
After about forty minutes, Uncle Peter opened the door. His face was red, his eyes wide. “Your mom is calling you, Robin,” he said, voice low and muffled.
I stepped into the room—and walked straight into chaos.My mom and dad looked weirdly happy. Aunt Margaret sat stiff at the table, bitter as ever. Cousin Olivia sat scrolling on her iPhone .While  cousin Jake was beside her, flipping a switchblade.
As I walked past them, I could feel their eyes on me. Cold. Judging. Sharp.
I finally reached my parents. My mom bent down, took my hands in hers, and smiled gently.

“Robin,” she said, “the lawyer man has something to tell you, okay? Just sit and listen, sweetheart.”
She guided me to a seat near the side of the table.  I was anxious. Every adult in the room was staring at me like some with kind eyes other with hatred. Then he spoke to me directly.
“Are you Robin, little girl?”
I nodded. “Yes.”
“Your grandfather left you something.”

Chapter 2: The Inheritance
All the talking had stopped. The will had been read. The gasps and gossip, the whispers and wild guesses—done.
There I sat, the youngest person in a room full of adults and almost-adults, all staring, all wondering: What did the little girl get?
Maybe it was a house. A car. An apartment. Something valuable. Something she could sell and make a fortune off of.
Nope.
I got a coffee-stained photo book. One filled with pictures of me when I was three years old.

That was it.
After that, people began to leave. Some returned to their hotels, others to cheaper motels. A few stayed behind at the house. The cousins and I—at least the girls—slept on the floor in the spare room. I didn’t sleep much. I just laid there, staring at the ceiling.
I wasn’t even thinking about the old photo book with my name on it. To be honest, I didn’t even know where it was. I just kept thinking about the next morning, when we’d leave this place behind. Back to my toys, my Barbie doll, and a world where people didn’t die or cry in front of strangers.
But of course, something had to happen.









Chapter 3: Uncle Peter Died
The next morning, we woke up to screams.
Uncle Peter was dead.
He was lying on the kitchen floor, white foam spilling from his mouth. My Aunt Margaret found him first. She called an ambulance and then woke up her older sibling—my mom.
I don’t think my mom believed her at first. I don’t think she thought her brother could actually be dead. But once she saw it for herself… the reality hit her like a wall. She gave in to her emotions and broke down, crying.
Her cries—and my aunt’s—woke the rest of the house. We rushed to see what was going on, but the kids were told to stay back. I still managed to sneak a glimpse. I saw my dad holding my mom, trying to comfort her, while Aunt Margaret cried over Uncle Peter’s body.
And in that moment, I started to wonder.
Maybe—just maybe—despite all the arguing and bitterness, they still had love for each other.

The ambulance came not long after. My cousin Olivia said that morning became official—whatever that meant. He was bagged up and taken to the morgue the same day. We all watched from afar as my mom and aunt climbed into the ambulance with him. My dad and a few other adults followed close behind in a car.

Back at the house, nothing changed—at least not for the kids. The really little ones kept playing like nothing happened. They didn’t understand how serious it was. Olivia and Jake, the older cousins, invited me to play on their phones, which was nice of them.
Hours passed like that, until I fell asleep on Olivia’s lap and Jake ended up playing with the younger kids.

Then everything changed again.
The adults returned. You could see it on their faces—they were tired, lost, like they didn’t know what to do next. The death of their brother had changed them.
Later, once the youngest kids had been taken to another room, my mom and aunt sat us older kids down. Their eyes were red, and their faces pale and swollen from crying.
My mom began, her voice barely above a whisper:

“Uncle Peter is dead, children. He died of an overdose… and we’re going to have to stay here for a while.”
No one spoke. We just stood, then slowly walked over and hugged them. That was just the beginning… the beginning of a terrible trip into the past.

Later that night, all the adults sat at the dinner table—after they thought the kids were asleep. But I wasn’t. I watched from the crack in the door again. My dad saw me, gave a small smile, then turned back to comfort my grieving mom.

She had just buried her suicidal father, and now she had to plan her brother’s funeral too.
It was hard seeing her like that—so defeated. So quiet. She wasn’t fighting the grief anymore; she let it consume her. I think she was just… tired of it all. But she couldn’t stop. She had to be strong for her sister. For us. And somehow, she still was.


Chapter 4: The Preparation
Like all funerals, there was preparation to be done.
But there was no time, and the husbands had to return to work on Monday. So, Mom and Aunt Margaret decided to stay behind and plan a funeral—for an addicted man who had died too suddenly.
The rest of us—mainly the kids—were to go back home and return the following Saturday for the service.
That was the plan: everyone except Mom and Aunt Margaret would leave. Then, once the arrangements were made, we’d come back for the funeral.

We were told all of this the next morning by the big kids, Olivia and Jake. They told us to pack up and get ready to leave. Not sure if they were telling the truth, I went to my parents’ room. I knocked on the door, and my dad opened it. He knelt down to hug me and asked why I was there.
“Why are you here, sweetheart?” he said gently.

“Where’s Mom?” I asked, trying to peek inside the room. I hadn’t seen her since they took Uncle Peter away.
“Mom’s tired, okay? Don’t worry about her,” he said. But I was worried.
Then he continued, “Sweetheart… I hate to say this, but we have to go home today. Mommy’s going to stay and finish some business here.”
“Don’t lie, Dad. Something’s wrong,” I muttered, staring at the way he tried to smile through his sadness.

His eyes welled up with tears, and suddenly… he couldn’t hold it in anymore.
“I’m sorry, Robin,” he whispered. “But Uncle Peter is gone. And we have to leave so Mommy can plan his funeral. But for now, I need you to go pack your things.”
“We’re leaving in a couple of minutes, okay sweetheart?”
“Okay…” I said softly, not wanting to make it harder for him.
I went to pack. I made sure to bring the photo book Grandpa had left me. I said goodbye to my cousins, and a few minutes later, I met my dad outside while he was saying farewell to our relatives.

I joined him, said my own goodbyes, then climbed into the car. He loaded my suitcase into the trunk and sat in the back with me.
And just like that—we were going home.

Chapter 5: Going Home
The journey home took about five hours, and in those five hours, all I could think about was my mom, who had stayed behind. My dad must have noticed, because in an attempt to lift the mood, he started singing and encouraged me to join in. We sang for hours, until finally, we were home that Sunday night.
For some reason, I was told to go straight to bed, and my dad stayed up late. I’m not sure why, but it must’ve been important.

The next day was Monday. Normally, I’d have to go to school, but my dad—understanding how tired I probably was—let me stay home. He worked from home anyway, so he could keep an eye on me. I ended up staying home the rest of the week too.

That entire week felt quiet… and lonely. Everything seemed cold and moody without my mom. Then came Friday, and once again we packed up the car. Me, my dad, and a few relatives who managed to make time all headed back to my grandparents’ house—to honor the death of my uncle.

Chapter 6: Back Again
This time, there were no unnecessary hugs or goodbyes. We had already seen most people the week before. Not everyone came back, either. Some didn’t want to make time for a man’s funeral that had only brought them trouble.

But never mind that—because when someone dies, everyone suddenly has something nice to say. Out of respect, no one talks about the past. No one brings up old wounds. We were just… happy to be together again, even if it was only for a moment.


Chapter 7: The Funeral
We buried my uncle on a Sunday. The sky was clear—bright even—and not a single cloud drifted by. The funeral was small. Maybe 20 to 30 people came. Not many, but I guess that’s expected. It was all very last-minute.
The service went as most do: prayers, crying, silence, and then finally… food. We all went back home to eat and celebrate Uncle Peter’s life.

He wasn’t a saint, but he didn’t have to be a devil either. Still, the things he did—some were just plain awful. So to see people crying over him was… surprising.

Chapter 8: The Dinner Table
There weren’t many adults around, so they let the younger kids sit at the adult table. We all gathered around, telling stories while stuffing food into our mouths and sipping from wine glasses—doing typical adult things.
But in the spaces between the laughter, in the quiet moments between the stories, you could feel it—that strange disconnect. That quiet, shared ignorance about who Uncle Peter really was. It didn’t feel like these were people who knew him. Just people who had been around him.

Tired of pretending to laugh at stories I didn’t care about, I excused myself and went to the kids’ room—the one we all slept in the last time we visited. But of course, Jake and Olivia, my two older cousins, were already there. Glued to their phones. Uninterested in talking. They kicked me out.
With nowhere else to go, I climbed up to the attic. I wanted to be alone, maybe stare at the stars through the roof window like I used to. That’s when I saw it.
The photo book.

The one my granddad had left me.
I thought I had taken it home… but there it was, covered in a thin layer of dust, like it had never been touched.
Cautiously, I stepped toward it, my fingers brushing the spine as I picked it up. I flipped through the first few pages to make sure—and yes. It was the same one the lawyer gave me. The same book I was so sure I’d left at home. But here it was, staring back at me like it had never left.

I was just about to sit down and open it properly when my dad called me from downstairs. Without thinking, I tucked the book under my arm and headed down.
The rest of the funeral passed the way funerals always do. A blur of formalities and forced smiles.
When it was over and my parents and I drove back home, I didn’t talk much. Instead of bonding with my dad like we usually did after big family events, I curled up with the photo book.

At first, it was beautiful.
Old pictures of my mom holding me as a baby. My dad bathing me in the sink. My old dog, Bojack, sleeping by the fire. The book was a time capsule of a life I hadn’t realized I’d lived. A reality I’d forgotten I was part of.
But when we finally got home… I put the book down somewhere and never saw it again.
Until eight years later.

Chapter 9: Eight Years Later
Eight years passed.
A lot happened. The world moved on while I just… stood there. My parents got divorced—which, by the way, was not my fault. My dad died. My mother became more like a ghost than a person. Now I was possibly moving in with my Aunt Marguerite, and there wasn’t much of anything left for me.
In that emptiness, I remembered the book.
I searched for it everywhere. High shelves. Dusty boxes. Closets. Attics. Until finally—I found it.

Clutched it to my chest and cried. Sobbed like a kid who had just found the last piece of their puzzle. The book was worn now—covered in dust, stained with old coffee, the pages falling apart. My name on the cover had started to fade. It looked like it hadn’t seen daylight in years.

But still… it was mine.
My life was falling apart, and this book my granddad left me was the only thing keeping me from falling with it.
I started flipping through the pages every night, whenever I had a quiet moment. I cried over the photos. Cried because I didn’t want to forget. But those days were gone. All of them.
Now I lived with Aunt Marguerite. My cousins Jake and Olivia were both off at university. It was a miserable existence, but things were getting better. I started a new school. I even made a 

new friend—Zara. For once, something good.
And I still clung to the book. Until one day, I noticed something strange.
On page 69—out of 190—was a photo of me and Zara. A picture I didn’t remember taking.
At first, I thought I had slipped it in there without realizing it. But over the next few weeks, more photos appeared. One of us at the mall. Another at a water park. Even one of us sitting on my bed, smiling for the camera.
But here's the thing—neither of us took those pictures. I checked my phone, my gallery, even old cloud backups. Nothing matched. These weren’t photos I had.
So who was taking them?
And how were they getting into this book?
I sat there, staring at the pages, trying to make sense of it. But in the end, I didn’t do anything.
I just decided to wait and see what would happen next.

Chapter 10: The Rumor
Time passed.
But the book didn’t stop. It kept adding things—photos, sticky notes. Notes that told me things about the past. And the future.
It showed me things I didn’t want to believe. My friends talking behind my back. My teachers whispering about me. I didn’t want to trust it, but everything it said eventually came true.
One day, I found a sticky note next to a new photo of me and Zara. The note read:
“This is not your friend.”
I laughed at first. It felt ridiculous.
But the book persisted.
It told me Zara was the reason the rumors started. That I was cursed. That I was bad luck. That I was the reason my mom left. The reason my dad was dead.
At some point, I stopped questioning it. I started believing it.
When it showed me a picture of my aunt and uncle fighting, I left the house for hours—just to avoid it. The book became my guide. My warning. My truth.
I didn’t realize it then, but it was feeding on me. Slowly, the book became everything. It controlled what I believed, how I moved, who I trusted.
And then… the photos stopped.
No more sticky notes. No more predictions. The book went silent. Page by page, the images began to disappear. Even the old ones. Until one day, it was just… blank.

Chapter 11: The End
I stopped reading the book after that.
Left it on a shelf. Ignored it.
Until one day, months later, I picked it up again.
I don’t even know why. Maybe I missed it. Maybe I needed it again.
And when I opened it, there was only one thing inside.
A single sticky note on the last page.
It read:
“Love, Grandpa.”
The End

1qarljn,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1qarljn/how_do_starbucks_gift_card_promos_actually_change/,How do Starbucks gift card promos actually change what you order?,"I’ve been thinking about how much those gift card bonuses and promos influence what I try at Starbucks.

A few things I’ve noticed personally:

* The “buy 3 drinks, get 1 free” or bonus card offers push me toward experimenting with drinks I’d skip otherwise (like trying new seasonal flavors or a different roast).
* Gift cards make me more likely to grab beans or whole‑bean coffee for home instead of just drinks, especially if it’s a bigger amount.

But I’m curious about you:

* Do gift card promos make you change your usual order or try new beans/drinks you wouldn’t otherwise?
* What’s the best Starbucks promo you’ve gotten lately that actually felt worth it?
* Have you ever used a promo gift card to stock up on coffee gear or beans instead of just drinks?

Would love to hear what actually moves the needle for regular Starbucks drinkers when it comes to these offers.",1,1768214283.0,starbucks,3,1.0,False

I am 36y Male, normal weight and quite active (playing tennis 3 times a week since 7 months). 

No smoke and no alcohol. Few to none coffee.

Last period is really stressful.

Lately (since 3 months) I am sleeping really bad and today it came to my mind that I might have to check my BP.

I woke up at 4am as I could not sleep and after 2h on the sofa I checked and the first reading was 135/88.

I soon got anxious.

I then checked again after some seconds and was 132/84 and the third one was 134/89

My wife suggested me to drink, wait a bit and re measure. Went to 126/81 and the last one I took was 123/76

Usually I am around 98-110/55-60.

Is that normal high values from this morning something I need to be worried about?

Neki su povratnici, neki kreću od nule, a možda se nađe i koji profi koji izvuče nešto korisno.  
Komentari su uvijek dobrodošli kako bismo zajedno nadopunili znanje.

Ovo će biti malo duži post, so… get a coffee ☕

**Zašto početi s teretanom?**

Teretana nije samo “napucavanje” mišića, to je transformacija tijela, uma i života.  
Za početnike može biti zastrašujuće, ali uz prave informacije i strukturu cijeli proces postaje puno jednostavniji i motivirajući.

**Postavi jasne ciljeve**

Prije nego što uopće kreneš, zapitaj se zašto to radiš.  
Bilo da je cilj mršavljenje, zdraviji i aktivniji život ili ulazak u fitness/profesionalne vode, od nečega se mora krenuti. Svi smo jednom krenuli od nule.  
Postavi realan cilj i fokusiraj se na njega.

**Strah od teretane kod početnika**

Mnogi ljudi (uključujući i mene kad sam krenuo prije 25+ godina) imaju strah od teretane.  
To je potpuno normalno i gotovo svi to prođu.

Isto je kao odlazak kod novog doktora, neugodno u početku, ali nakon par dolazaka strah nestane.  
Kako ti teretana postaje poznatija, s vremenom se pretvori u mjesto gdje se osjećaš kao doma, dok jednog dana ne shvatiš da dolaziš potpuno opušten.

Što može pomoći:

* Dolaziti u off-peak terminima (npr. vikendom rano ujutro)
* Prvih mjesec dana trenirati uz trenera
* Ili trenirati s prijateljem koji već ima iskustva
* Mnoge teretane nude i uvodni trening

**Trening za početnike, osnove**

Za potpuni početak često se preporučuje full body trening 2-3x tjedno.  
Fokus treba biti na velikim, višezglobnim vježbama, ali s umjerenim opterećenjem (do \~60 % maksimuma).  
I dobro je isprobavati nove stvari, ali kada odaberete jedan program, držite se istog barem 3-4 mjeseca.

Višezglobne vježbe:

* Čučanj
* Mrtvo dizanje (ne raditi bez pravilne forme!)
* Iskoraci
* Bugarski čučanj (ne preporučam početnicima)
* Bench press
* Zgibovi

Zapamti: forma je važnija od težine!  
Nemoj biti ego lifter. Nitko te ne gleda u teretani koliko ti misliš. Svatko je u svojem filmu.

Prvo savladaj tehniku, kontrolu i povezanost mozga i mišića, kilaža će doći sama.

**Koliko puta tjedno trenirati?**

Ovisi od osobe do osobe.  
Kao početnik ne treba forsirati, gledaj na ovo kao na maraton, a ne sprint.

U redu je trenirati 2x tjedno, ali i 6x tjedno.  
Slušaj svoje tijelo. Koliko je bitan trening, toliko je bitan i odmor.

Trening možeš pratiti pomoću aplikacija, osobno preporučujem [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/).

**Prehrana**

Ovo je dio koji puno ljudi zanemari.  
Mnogi misle da mogu “nadtrenirati” lošu prehranu, ali to je nemoguće.

Ameri kažu**:** “You can’t outtrain a bad diet.” I to stvarno je tako.  
Prehrana čini 70–80 % cijelog progresa.

Mršavljenje je čista termodinamika:

* Unosiš manje kalorija nego što trošiš onda gubiš kilograme.
* Unosiš više onda dobivaš kilograme.

TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) je ukupna količina kalorija koju tvoje tijelo potroši u jednom danu.  
Uključuje:

* bazalni metabolizam
* fizičku aktivnost
* probavu hrane

Ukratko: TDEE je broj kalorija potreban za održavanje iste tjelesne težine.

* Masa: +300 do 500 kcal iznad TDEE
* Definicija/mršavljenje: -300 do 500 kcal ispod TDEE

Drži se toga svaki dan, trenirao ili ne.  
Nikad ne dodavaj “potrošene kalorije s treninga”, to je već uračunato.

Praćenje kalorija je najjednostavnije uz apps kao [Yazio](https://www.yazio.com/Uz) ili [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/).  
I uz to će ti trebati još samo digitalna kuhinjska vaga (može i analogna).

**Proteini** (okvirno pravilo):

* Žene: 1-1,5 g po kg tjelesne mase
* Muškarci: 1,5-2 g po kg tjelesne mase

**Suplementi**

Početnici su često zatrpani informacijama i reklamama, ali u praksi je jednostavno:

* Whey protein: koristan ako ne možeš unijeti dovoljno proteina hranom
* Kreatin:  najistraženiji i jedan od najboljih suplemenata (posebno koristan ženama)
* Multivitamin: uvijek dobro dođe
* ZMA: osobno jedan od najboljih (san, brzi oporavak, imunitet)

**Prevencija ozljeda i oporavak**

* Prije treninga napravi barem kratko zagrijavanje.
* Prve 1-2 serije radi s cca 40 % kilaže i 15+ ponavljanja.
* Spavaj 7-9 sati.
* Pij barem 2L vode dnevno.
* Istezanje ili poseban dan za mobilnost je ogroman plus.

**Motivacija**

Motivacija često varira, ali disciplina donosi rezultate.  
Na dane kad ti se ne da, samo pripremi torbu za gym – nekada je to dovoljno da te pokrene i natjera da odradiš trening.  
Često se dogodi da, iako nemaš volje, taj trening bude jedan od boljih.

**Trener ili bez trenera**

Ja sam krenuo solo i došao do IFBB titule bez trenera, ali dobar trener može napraviti čuda:

* Ubrzati napredak
* Naučiti te u mjesec dana ono za što bi sam trebao godine

Ipak, trener nije nužan ako imaš volju učiti.  
Problem je što je danas teško pronaći dobrog trenera, puno i previse je samoprozvanih IG trenera.

**Najčešće greške početnika**

* Prevelike kilaže prerano (Ego lifting ili što će drugi reći ako dižem male kilaže)
* Premalo odmora
* Loša prehrana
* Pretreniranost

Pretreniranost se često ne primijeti jer ljudi ne prate vlastiti napredak nekom aplikacijom. Zna se dogoditi da snaga na treningu padne 2-3 treninga zaredom, a ako se povećaju kalorije, a pad se i dalje događa, radi se o pretreniranosti i treba uzeti pauzu.
