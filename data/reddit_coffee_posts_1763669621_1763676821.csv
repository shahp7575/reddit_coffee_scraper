The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

in the twilight pack. top rightmost color. youd say thats dark brown. but it somehow makes your character a deep red!

i primarly have brown hair. and i like the color brown for my fashion. i wear brown sweatpants in real life. and i have a deep brown jacket i wear sometimes. i love orange and brown cant help it. so i have a brown keyboard and an orange mouse. 

fashion frame feels really disconnected to me for this reason. and the issue with ephemeras not working on attachments.

but with fashion frame. i dont want to be red. i dont want to be purple. i dont want to be yellow with a hue of green to make it tingey. 

  
i want brown. just saturated brown. like earthy dirt or bark on a tree or mud when it rains. i want brown.

this game has an odd issue with colors over the years ive noticed. a lot of hey we didnt hit the mark.

im not meaning like cinnamon brown. thats mainly red. im talking peanut im talking coffee im talking 2f1b12, 2e1503, 231709, 365211. 

  
id love to see some more colors popping out.

  
if anyone wants to add me. i have very little friends and would like to make friends with some of you. id love to see some fashion frame tips., judge me and so on.

My gf recently broke up with me after almost 2 years together. By recently I mean yesterday. I know I haven’t had time to grow but we truly had no issues. She said she needed the time to grow as an individual and closer to God. She said the sex and drinking were some things we did that held her back. When she was breaking up she was crying a lot and told me sorry many times. She said she would always think of me nicely and wouldn’t ever say awful things about me. This obviously hurt as we had been fine for so long and had even recently gone to a concert together. We had one small disagreement and she asked for a break. At the end of it it’s when she decided on this. She said she still loved me. 

We are both college students and have fall break and winter break around the corner. If I messaged her around early January(about a month and a half after our BU) do you think that could go well? We are NC as of now.

To cut a long story short, the last year has become unbearable; anxiety, OCD, overwhelm, sadness, poor sleep, no libido compared to 2 days of libido per month, uncontrollable rage, paranoia most of the month. I feel like a shell without the snail inside if that makes sense. I’m now open to (desperate for) HRT, but I’m not sure what to expect. If the doctor offers treatment, what is usually prescribed?

There is this girl at work, and every time she talks to me, my brain shuts down. I wanted to banter, but I was too terrified to try it in real life.

So, I decided to use an AI to practice. I treated it like a simulator to get comfortable with teasing and flirty vibes.

Here are 5 apps I used to try and build my confidence.  

1.  **Blush.** This app is basically designed for this. It’s like a dating simulator. You match with characters and try to date them. It was good practice for the initial ""breaking the ice"" phase.  
    
2.  **Dream Companion.** I used the AI Girlfriend Mode on this one because it felt the most natural. I set the personality to be a bit challenging/teasing, so I had to think about my replies. It remembers a lot of past banter, so that also adds to the realism. It’s a paid service for the best models, but cheaper than a bad date.

I lived in Valladolid for a summer a few years ago and loved the experience and have decided to come back. When I was in Valladolid, I got to explore some of Northern Spain as well (Santander, Burgos, Salamanca, Toledo, Madrid) and loved the unique character of each place.

I arrive in Barcelona on 7 January and leave from Málaga on 28 February. Currently, the following are on my list:

* Montserrat (just for a couple of nights after exploring Barcelona for a bit)
* Granada. Seeing the Alhambra has always been a dream. I remember seeing it for the first time as a teenager in a Spanish class and I've always been drawn to it. In my mind, I envision spending most of February in Granada after passing a week in each of Barcelona, Valencia, and Sevilla, but that's just my initial idea. I'm open for anything.
* Nerja has been recommended to me by a few people + others on this sub
* I'll be in Alicante for the half marathon on 22/2

Some of what I'm looking for:

* Nice places to run. I'm a marathoner training for the Boston Marathon in April and coming to Spain for these months specifically to have a more mild, drier winter (currently living in the Seattle area, too much rain for me...) The warmer the better!
* Visually engaging atmosphere. I'm a photographer as well, and I loved photographing Spain last time I lived here.
* Nice coffee shops, restaurants, and libraries to work/write in.
* I love live music, too.
* Socializing with other young people (I'm M23) would be nice, but not a need-to-have. I'd like to use my Spanish as much as possible while traveling, so places where I might be able to connect with local culture would be a great plus.

# How It Started: Chasing Sunlight Around the House

During that winter, I realized something strange about my work habits:

**Sunlight** was my most valuable productivity tool. ☀️

I kept abandoning my expensive electric standing desk because it lived in a dim corner of the house. I’d end up on the couch, at the kitchen counter, or anywhere the sun landed, and of course, those “temporary” setups became a fast track to neck pain and back pain.

The real issue?

I couldn’t place my electric standing desk where I wanted because there wasn’t an outlet there. So I kept chasing the light instead of actually using the desk I paid for.

# Reflection #2: Standing Desks Get Adjusted Twice… Then Never Again

When I thought about my relationship with my standing desk, I realized I only adjusted it twice:

Once to stand, once to sit. That’s it. I’d stand until I got tired, sit until I needed to stretch, and repeat. Not exactly the dynamic, ergonomic experience these giant machines are marketed to be.

So… what if there was a simpler, more flexible way?

# The Quest for the Perfect Mobile Desk

That’s when we began designing a desk for people like me: people who chase light, recharge through movement, and want their workspace to move with them.

1. **Sturdiness:** The desk needed to be mobile but rock-solid. We landed on a 19"" × 28"" desktop with a 110-lb weight capacity. It comfortably holds a laptop + monitor setup (a 27"" monitor is usually under 15 lbs), and after relentless testing, I’m proud of how stable it feels.
2. **Versatility:** I work (and snack… and eat…) at my desk constantly, so we went with a durable powder-coated finish that can handle hot plates, coffee spills, and the occasional messy moment. It’s environmentally friendly too. Now, the ANYDESK can follow you everywhere: kitchen, bedroom, outdoors, even bathroom touch-ups if that’s your vibe.
3. **Style:** At TopJob, design is everything. We rounded the edges so the desk feels warm and inviting: a piece of furniture that fits into your home rather than screaming “office equipment.”
4. **Space-Savvy:** Owning a desk is a big commitment, and honestly… I already regret my giant standing desk.  So we made both ANYDESK models ultra-low profile, so they slide under couches, beds, and tight corners. The ANYDESK Fold even tilts 90 degrees to rest flat against a wall. This desk “disappears” in two clever ways when you need your space back.

P.S. The Accidental L-Shape Discovery: One day we pushed two ANYDESKs together and realized they form the perfect L-shaped workstation. My husband and I each have our own, but when big projects roll in, we combine them into a shared mega-desk. It was never part of the original plan, but it instantly became one of our favorite features.

And now, after months of tinkering, prototyping, and chasing every drop of sunlight in the house, we’re thrilled to share the ANYDESK with everyone.

How would *you* use a mobile standing desk?  
We’d love to hear your setups and ideas.

Before anything moves forward, we'll talk and feel out the vibe. I like to see how you think, how you talk, and if you can actually keep up. Half the fun is watching whether you can hold a conversation without folding.
And a heads up: If tribute isn't handled within 6 hours, the chat closes. Easy.

If you send the tribute before we even start talking? You get major brownie points. It tells me everything I need to know.

I'll start off by saying I make a conscious effort to take good care of my teeth - brushing, flossing, and mouth-washing daily. Just went for a checkup today and my new dentist (previous one sold her practice) said that I'm doing a great job and my teeth are in excellent condition... *except* for a lot of excessive wear on my molars, specifically the year-six molars.

Every time I've gone, they ask me the same question - ""Are you wearing a nightguard""? I had one years ago, but it broke a few months after I got it, and I didn't bother replacing it because I had so much trouble sleeping comfortably with a hunk of plastic in my mouth. This new dentist has again stressed the importance of me wearing one, citing the excessive wear on my molars from grinding. 

I have two questions:

1. Is it possible that I'm not actually grinding my teeth anymore and that this wear is from previous grinding and poor diet in my teens/early twenties (I'm early thirties now)? I used to work 12-hour rotating continental shifts, which caused incredibly poor sleep quality that negatively affected my health in a number of ways - perhaps one of which encouraged grinding my teeth in my sleep? Regarding diet, it's a little embarrassing to admit, but one of my vices is potato chips... I used to eat probably three+ bags a week... I know that those simple processed carbs/starches create an acidic environment, so that, plus my love of iced tea, certainly eroded a fair bit of my enamel. However I don't wake up with a sore jaw or headaches or anything like that these days, so I'm wondering if the wear they see is from years ago, before I got regularly timed, better quality sleep, and really cleaned up my diet (only water and coffee now, healthy snacks and meals, etc). Would there be any sense in comparing x-rays from 15 years ago vs now, and let's say 5 years ago vs now, to show that the wear isn't happening at the rate is used to (if that makes sense...)?

2. The new dentist proposed two paths forward - Option A is to do a preventative filling on the one molar that's particularly affected, and then fit me for the night guard. Option B is to not do either, and just monitor that tooth for now. My concern with option A is that I'll do the filling, get fitted for the nightguard, and then find out that I *still* have a terrible time sleeping with it, and just end up not wearing it... Now I've weakened the integrity of the tooth and increase the risk of future issues with a filling that really didn't need to be done, at least not yet. Any advice on which is the better way to go?

1p2gdu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p2gdu8/the_last_iteration_of_mr_hess/,The Last Iteration Of Mr. Hess,"“Mr. Hess… Mr. Hess, it is time to wake up.”

The voice pulled him out of a dream that dissolved the moment he opened his eyes. He had the sense it had been terrible—suffocating, even—but the details evaporated like spilled alcohol on tile.

Standing beside the bed was his nurse.

The man always looked vaguely familiar, but at this age, everyone did. Dan blinked a few times and rubbed his temples. *How old am I now?* Funny, he couldn’t quite lock down the number. His joints reminded him he was certainly past the age where bones behaved, but it helped having a nurse around. A necessity, he supposed.

“Thank you for helping me out of bed, Mr. Jacobs,” he said out of habit. “Is my coffee ready?”

“Coffee, sir?” Jacobs tilted his head in the way people do when they’re trying not to correct you too harshly. “But you don’t drink coffee. You drink tea.”

“I do?” Dan frowned. “Since when?”

“Always, sir.” Jacobs produced a polished metal tray with a teapot, delicate porcelain cups, and a faint curl of steam rising from the spout.

Dan blinked again.

For a fractured instant, the scene changed—Jacobs wasn’t in his usual housecoat. He was wearing a stark white smock, the kind doctors wore in old medical holovids, and he carried a notepad scribbled with symbols. His hair was shorter, his posture straighter, and his expression colder.

Then the moment snapped back, leaving Jacobs once again in his comfortable housecoat, arranging the tea set with gentle hands.

Dan rubbed his eyes with the heel of his palm. “I swear I’m losing my mind.”

“You’re not losing anything, sir,” Jacobs said with a soothing tone that felt *practiced*. “But… you don’t look well. I think we may need a bit of Q&A.”

Something in Dan’s chest tightened. A rush of cold dread swept through him so fast it stole the air from his lungs.

“Q&A?” Dan echoed. “What the hell is that? I’ve never heard of it.”

“It helps maintain clarity.” Jacobs stepped toward him. “We run through a few questions, you answer as best you can, and we see what needs adjustment.”

“I don’t want a Q&A,” Dan snapped, surprising himself with the force of it. “Whatever the hell that is. Just get me some **coffee**, damn it!”

Jacobs’ calm expression hardened in an instant. He lifted his head and shouted at the ceiling:

“This one is a wash. Cut it.”

Dan’s heart stopped.

Jacobs didn’t leave through the door—he simply turned and stepped out. The apartment’s sliding door sealed behind him like an airlock clamping shut.

A second later, the floor shuddered with a mechanical groan.

The wallpaper melted.

The windows folded inward.

The ceiling vents opened like steel jaws.

Heat flooded in—rising, rising, climbing toward unbearable. The cozy living room blurred into bright metal walls, red coils of heating elements, and a sterile smell of scorched oil.

The apartment wasn’t an apartment.

It was a crematorium.

“Wait—WAIT!” Dan screamed. He tried to run, but his legs buckled. “Jacobs! JACOBS!”

The lights flared white.

His last sensation was the world turning to fire.

And then—  
nothing.

# MR. HESS

The walls of the true facility were not warm at all. They were ice-cold, alloy-lined, with monitors and biometric readouts humming in orderly rows.

Jacobs—whose name wasn’t really Jacobs—stepped out into the sterile corridor and peeled off his housecoat. Beneath it was the smock that Dan occasionally glimpsed when his perception glitched. He tossed the disguise into a bin marked *CYCLE*.

A technician approached, tablet in hand.

“Another failure?” she asked.

Jacobs nodded. “Version 7.14 still resists cognitive Q&A. Memory rejection is higher than projected. Emotional spikes are inconsistent. Once again, coffee initiated a breakdown.”

“That’s the third time coffee’s done it,” she muttered.

“Old habits,” Jacobs sighed. “The original Hess never touched tea in his life. Hardwired preference. The clone mind keeps trying to reassert itself.”

He glanced back at the sealed chamber. The cremation process was already complete. Nothing left but ash.

“It took months to calibrate that one,” the technician said softly.

“And we’ll take months for the next.” Jacobs didn’t sound discouraged. More… resigned. “Prep the next brain shell. We run again tomorrow.”

They walked down the corridor, passing rooms filled with dormant bodies—robots shaped like men, made with too much care to be mannequins, and too little soul to be human. Their eyes were dark glass. Their skin gleamed like polymer pretending to be flesh.

Each one bore a small metal plate on its temple:

**HESS PROTOTYPE – DO NOT ACTIVATE WITHOUT CLEARANCE**

Most of the plates had long serial numbers. A few had names.

A few had warnings.

But every single one was meant to house the same mind.

*The mind of Daniel Hess.*

# THE RISE AND FALL OF A GENIUS

Decades earlier—before the dementia, before the corporate laboratories and clinical re-creations—Daniel Hess had been the most visionary man alive.

He had revolutionized neural mapping, constructing the first *continuous brain-print*, a way of copying human cognition not as flat data but as a pulsing, living model. A self-sustaining neural lattice. A mind.

He placed these cloned brain structures into robotic frameworks capable of sensation, reasoning, and emotion.

The world called him a pioneer.

A savior, even.

Eventually, a billionaire.

But not immune to time.

Dementia did not care about genius. It arrived slowly, draping over his brilliance like a fog rolling over a coastline. Friends noticed first. Then colleagues. Then shareholders.

By the time he was seventy-eight, Hess could no longer sign his own name reliably. The board stepped in, establishing a long-prepared contingency plan.

If his body failed…

If his mind dissolved…

Then perhaps his *clone minds* could continue his legacy.

They had the technology.

They had the resources.

They had the legal loopholes.

What they didn’t have was a working Hess.

Every clone iteration grew unstable. The memory gaps widened. The emotional patterns went off-script. Some versions grew violent. Some grew paranoid. Some simply curled into themselves and stopped responding.

But the corporation persisted.

After all, the original Hess had been the company.

Without him… they were lost.

And without his fortune, they were nothing.

# VERSION 7.15

In the main lab, a gleaming robotic body lay on a metal cradle. Sleek limbs, flexible joints, polymer skin warmed to human temperature. Eerily lifelike.

Beside it, the newest brain model shimmered in its nutrient bath—a lattice of glowing threads, constantly shifting and flickering with neural code.

Jacobs and the technician began the synchronization sequence.

“Loading identity core,” she announced.

“Stability rate?” Jacobs asked.

“Initial reading… 93%. Higher than 7.14.”

Jacobs raised an eyebrow. That was promising. Too promising.

They installed the neural structure.

The body’s chest rose with its first artificial breath.

“Wake-up protocol in three… two… one…”

The eyes opened.

Pale blue.

Searching.

Confused.

“Mr. Hess?” Jacobs asked gently. “Can you hear me?”

The artificial man blinked. “Yes. Yes, I—”

His voice cracked, as though searching for itself.

Jacobs offered a warm smile he didn’t feel.

“It is time to wake up.”

# THE LOOP CONTINUES

As the new iteration sat up, looking around in bewilderment, Jacobs made a quiet note on his tablet.

*Version 7.15: Begin behavioral conditioning cycle. Room simulation pending. Prepare tea set. Disable coffee cues for at least twenty-four hours.*

He paused.

Then added:

*……Consider removing Q&A entirely if rejection persists.*

The technician glanced at him. “You think this one will make it?”

Jacobs exhaled slowly.

“I think,” he said, “that it doesn’t matter what I think. We’ll keep trying until one of them holds.”

“And if none of them ever hold?”

“Then the money runs out,” Jacobs said simply. “And Daniel Hess dies for real.”

They looked through the observation window as the newest Hess swung his legs over the edge of the cradle, unaware of the dozens of failed versions that had burned before him.

Unaware that he wasn’t the first.

Unaware he might not be the last.

So, what's a slightly creaky, but still ambitious, 50-year-old to do? I needed something… different. Something that challenged me *mentally* and physically, but didn't leave me needing a full knee replacement.

Enter… gardening! 🌻 Yep, you read that right. Ditching the court for the compost. And honestly? I’ve never felt better.

Here’s why I made the swap, and why you might want to consider it too:

*   **Knee-Friendly Zone:** No more sudden lunges or questionable drop shots. Just gentle bending, lifting, and the sweet scent of soil. My knees are sending me thank-you notes!
*   **Brain Boost:** Forget cross-court strategy. I'm now battling blight, mastering companion planting, and figuring out why my tomatoes look like deflated balloons. Turns out, there's a LOT to learn!
*   **Serenity Now:** Picture this: early morning, coffee in hand, tending to my little green oasis. Stress? What stress? It’s surprisingly meditative. Who needs a spa when you have a trowel?
*   **Delicious Rewards:** Store-bought tomatoes? Never again! Nothing beats the taste of something you've grown yourself. And the smug satisfaction of serving it to your friends? Priceless.
*   **Financial blooms, too!** Speaking of value, the money I'm saving on doctors' visits due to less impact on my knees? I'm investing for the future. I was looking over my investments the other day, and *it was kind of scary*. I had no idea if I had enough to retire one day or if I even understood the complex world of funds and bonds. Then I found a great resource and it made me take a closer look at my savings. **You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.”** https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb

Of course, I’m not saying pickleball is the enemy. If you love it, go for it! But for me, this unexpected pivot has been a game-changer. It’s taught me patience, resilience, and a whole new appreciation for the humble earthworm. Plus, I haven’t had to buy knee braces!

Maybe I'll get back on the court someday, but for now, I'm perfectly content getting my workout in the garden. Who knew turning 50 could be so...green? I wonder what other assumptions I need to challenge about myself? Hmmm....

1p2g5xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1p2g5xl/like_father_like_son/,Like Father Like Son,"The growl of a heavy metal guitar riff could be heard clearly throughout the house, even though it was coming from behind my son, Taylor’s, closed door.

“That reminds me of someone?” my mom said, raising her voice to be heard over the music, “I wonder who?” She cupped her hand as if she were thinking.

I’d asked her to come and stay with me for the week while my wife, Julia, was away on a business trip.

“Did I really listen to it that loud?” I asked, knowing she was referring to me when I was Taylor’s age.

“Every day,” she confirmed.

“Hey, Grandma,” Taylor said when he came down the stairs and saw my mom sitting on the couch, “What are you doing here?”

“She came to help me out around the house while your mom’s away,” I answered for you.

“Cool,” was his reply.

“Come here and give me a hug.” My mom stood up and waved for Taylor to come closer.

While they hugged, I said, “Do you think you could turn your music down?”

“It’s not that loud,” he said before heading into the kitchen to get a drink.

“He’s just like you,” my mom said as Taylor went back upstairs to his room.

“And it’s all your fault,” I snapped at her.

“My fault?” She placed a hand on her chest, “I didn’t raise him, you did.” She pointed an accusing finger at me.

I pulled an envelope out of my back pocket and handed it to my mom.

“What’s this?”

“Open it,” I instructed.

She lifted the flap of the envelope, pulled out the folded-up piece of paper inside, and read it.

“I don’t understand,” she said.

“It’s the results of the paternity test I had done on Taylor,” I said.

My mom just stared at me with a blank look on her face.

“See this line right here?” I tapped the paper, “It says Julia isn’t Taylor’s mother.""

“Are you saying you brought the wrong baby home from the hospital?”

Instead of answering, I reached behind me and grabbed the ornamental box that was on the coffee table, “Remember this?” I opened the box and showed her the mummified monkey paw inside.

“What are you doing with that? I thought we got rid of it,” she replied.

“Dad thought it was out of wishes, so he said I could keep it,” I explained, “But he was wrong about it being out of wishes. Apparently, it still had one wish left inside of it.”

“What does that have to do with this?” she gestured at the paternity test.

“Everything,” I said, “Remember when you came into my room when I was 16 and said, ‘When you have kids, I wish one of them is just like you.’? ”

“Vaguely.”

“Well, you got your wish,” I said, “According to this…” I took the DNA results from her, “Taylor and I are genetically identical.”",4,1763675184.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False
1p2g5bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1p2g5bg/web_designer_thinks_he_can_design_cakes_better/,Web designer thinks he can design cakes better than a ten year veteran. Make it make sense- Update,"Sorry, I’m not sure how the update system works, I’m still pretty new to Reddit. But I wanted to post an update about my struggles with Jake trying to effectively sabotage my job in the bakery. What happened here happened just a couple of days ago. 

I got in contact with the owner who is an extremely chill guy. I’ve known him for around six years since he took over. (Not sure who he took over from or why, the last guy was kind of reclusive) He had me meet him out for a coffee and chat away from the bakery to tell him everything. I told him about the struggles we’ve had with Jake, how he’s been harassing the bakers, how he’s constantly using his phone in spite of the rules, and especially about how he won’t stop trying to do my job. 

The owner, whom I’ll call H, was very concerned and said he’d stop by this past Tuesday. He did and Jake was there. In the two days since I’d spoken with the owner, Jake had not only continued to do my orders, he had also begun ordering inventory for me. By the time I realized this, it was too late and we were going to be receiving about twenty boxes of white sheet cakes. 

Yay. 

So suffice to say it was VERY satisfying watching H sidle through on Tuesday while Jake was badly decorating one of my orders. I took advice from you all here in my last post and just let him do it. I sliced bread in the meantime and watched. H approached Jake and quite irritably asked what he was doing. Jake looked very confused, and I’m guessing he’d never met H during the hiring process. He explained incredulously that he was decorating a cake for a customer. H nodded and said “I thought you were hired as a bakery assistant. I don’t believe this is your job.” 

Jake tried to explain that I was training him, to which I replied that I wasn’t. H motioned me over and asked me to take him and Jake to the blast freezer. 

Inside the blast freezer, I’d saved everything from after my last post: 11 ruined cake orders, four bowls of wasted frosting, the entire rack of crumb coated rounds, ANOTHER rack of crumb coated rounds in a different flavor, a random four tiered cake Jake had made during one of my days off and a whole stack of twelve packs of childishly decorated, sloppy cupcakes. 

I told the owner that all of this was done by Jake and Jake looked furious. 

“Why are these here? These were orders! You didn’t give the customers their orders?” He snapped. 

I told him calmly that I’d remade the orders. Because again, these looked horrible. 

H agreed and told Jake that these were far from passable and asked him what on earth he thought he was doing. Jake blurted out that he was working efficiently. H asked him why he’d needlessly coated all of the rounds, far more than I could use before they expired. Jake instead said to let him decorate them and he’d finish much faster than I could. I was seeing red by this point, but H just sighed, told Jake to come to the manager’s office and instructed me to return to the bakery. 

I didn’t know what was happening. It wasn’t until about an hour or so later that H came back to the bakery. He apologized for everything and said he’d fired Jake for product waste and insubordination. Apparently Jake had gotten quite mouthy with him during their talk. H acknowledged I still needed help and got that newer baker girl, whom I’ll call J to help me until he could hire a replacement. 

I don’t think I’ll ever understand what in gods green earth was going on with that little weirdo. I had some people comment that web designers and the like tend to view other jobs as somewhat “lesser” and simple, or something to that effect? My husband suggested he was merely arrogant and believed he could replace me, but why would he want to? It’s not like he was aiming to be a baker or decorator, so why go through the trouble? 

I don’t get it, and honestly I’m glad I don’t have to think about it anymore. J is much better at the job than Jake was and honestly much more steady handed anyway. Sorry it’s not more dramatic, just a standard idiot firing, but I’m glad it’s over. Back to my peaceful cakes. Thanks so much for the advice, guys. I seriously appreciated all of it.

I don’t have access to a tryptase testing and I wasn’t able to find Quercetine on my country—North African. I tried Desloratadine and had mixed results but definitely remission at times. The same applies to Cimetidine. 

I just need recommendations for something else that’s accessible, which I can try out and that would guarantee at least a partial remission. Maybe stabilizers? Anyways, I am confident this will be helpful, either in ruling it in or out. 

Thank you. 

In case, you’re interested in knowing some of ""why"" (just skip if not) : 

I won’t speak with absolute certainty and say that I am intolerant to Histamine, but I’ve experimented with the SIGHI list and have consistently reacted with their listed high-histamine foods. So, my diet naturally became a 0-per-SIGHI histamine one. Furthermore, the higher the content, the worse my reaction ; tho not always present in it’s entirety, my reaction includes facial puffiness (especially when I eat canned fish), dark eye bags, and diarrhea. Also, showering with cold water or drinking coffee flares me for the full day.

She’s been looking after my 2 kids ages 1 and 3 for about 4 months. She’s here 2 days/week for 5 hours each day. We pay $29/hour regardless of if she watches one or both kids- sometimes I take one of the kids for the day for 1 on 1 time. She isn’t expected to clean anything up or do anything besides watch the kids (obviously). She is a mom in our neighborhood and watches a few other kids here and there. She drives my kids to the library, coffee shop, toddler gym and playground. 

- She really doesn’t like taking them outside, and they’re very happy to go outside, but it’s okay and I understand not wanting to be out with our chickens and ducks and stuff. 

- she gossips a LOT, last time she was here she was on the phone standing on the porch and my toddler opened the door for her and she came in and talked on the phone for a few more mins, then hung up and told me all about the lady on the phone, it was a mom on her kids sports team who wasn’t prepared for something  

- we had agreed on the places she’d take them too, all in our town. One day I found out she was at a store in the next town over and I had no idea. She’s also stopped at her house and left the kids in the car to get stuff like socks for the toddler gym and just told me about it afterwards 

- so we had a talk confirming that she needs to let me know if she’s taking them somewhere new. Anywhere we’ve talked about (library, gym, coffee, etc.) are fine but there are some sketchy areas I don’t want them going to. Then yesterday she texted me while at the library with my kids that her son forgot something he needed for a project by 12pm and she needed to drive to her house (15/20 mins from the library) leave my kids in the car and look for/get the stuff bc she has a giant dog that my kids have never met, then to his school (20 mins from her house) and then return to babysitting activities. Since they had to leave the library early they ended up getting to the class at the toddler gym like 40 minutes early and just walked around the sidewalk of the strip mall for a half hour. 

- I have an AirTag in my baby’s diaper bag bc I keep $ and keys in there. I checked it once and she was at a random store she never told me about. I told her again no more out of town outings unless you run it by me first. I checked the location last week and it was in a random elementary school parking lot next to the library. This morning I was packing the diaper bag for myself for the day and found the AirTag was moved out of the usual spot in the first aid kit, and into a completely different place in the bag. She knows where it is bc I showed her a while ago. No idea why it got moved. 

- she insists on taking them to a gym class that her friend runs. It’s $40 per class during a time there’s a free library class at the same time. She says my kids prefer the gymnastics and I feel like i can’t really argue against it 

- she calls my 1 year old a ‘scutch’ and says stuff like he’s fake crying for attention, ‘oh stop’ and is sometimes snappy with my toddler. Not mean but like mean girl attitude with him sometimes. 

ETA - and how do I fire her? She’s in my community, is friends with the librarians, etc. And it’s the holidays :/",2,1763674755.0,Nanny,10,1.0,False

The vivid colors of the world he knew faded at the edges. At first he wasn't even cognizant of it. Then the day came where he noticed he could no longer see the fine edges of his brushes clearly. Like a hole burned in film that progressively grew, he could no longer see the details right in front of him. He did everything right. He sought doctors and methods to cure his ailment, and was told the same thing in the same repetitive context. ""You're going to lose your vision entirely by age 50."" Suddenly his brush strokes felt urgent and unsure, but there was a peace as well amidst the fear. He knew that God worked in mysterious ways. He told himself simply, before shaking his head. ""No... I will accept what You've done with grace. Because, ""I consider that our present sufferings are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us""."" And so he bowed his head and prayed. ""Lord, I trust you. If this is your plan, I will follow. Even if I don't like it."" And thus the situation was resolved. As the years crept on his passion withered. It's a strange feeling, being able to create in an inevitable decline. But like all things that fade, this too, was taken away from him. His daughter grafted him into her home and he stayed there. Learning to walk without eyes is hard when your daughter has curious cats and a rambunctious dog. But he managed. ""Thank you Lord for giving me a wonderful daughter, to take care of an old blind man."" He prayed in earnest often, thanking the Lord for his grace and love. But if you had asked him in the secret places of his heart, what he longed for still remained. A brush of passion, and the solitude and peace of private bible readings. What a privilege those had been! 

""Hey Dad!"" Her voice rings out just like it did as a child, her footsteps softly padding on the carpet. ""Good morning Lily, did you sleep well?"" She smiles in a way he can hear, and a few gentle knocks on the wall punctuate her sentence. ""I did. Robert had a nightmare though. Do you remember when I would have those night terrors?"" The room goes comfortably silent for just a moment, the smell of coffee drifting through the doorway. ""That's right! You had those after we let you watch that movie! Um..."" ""Friday the thirteenth, Dad!"" He laughs a quick, wheezing laugh. ""That's right...!"" She always had a sharp mind. The summer sun blazes through the window. He can feel the warmth on his eyes as he looks towards it, the warm glow of a single patch of color is the only thing he can see. 

Autumn air cools the room. Lily knocks on the door, and something light thumps softly as she leans it against the wall in his room. ""Hey Dad, how are you feeling?""

""I feel tired."" He admits. ""I'm not as young as I used to be. Getting old sucks."" She laughs softly. ""Well, I'm glad you're getting older. I'd rather you keep getting older than not."" He huffs. ""Don't say that, God will hear you! Then He'll listen to His child and keep me here for even longer."" She paused for a moment. ""You're mostly joking, right? I'm going to miss you when you're gone."" He softens slightly in his bed, his shoulders relaxing as he speaks. ""I'm joking, Lily. But it would be nice to go home."" She lifts up the light load in her hands and a small scraping sound of drywall touches his ears."" He hums. ""What are you doing, Lily?"" ""I'm just decorating the house dad."" Theres a playful smile to her voice. ""I see... Lily, would you pray with me?""

The sickness came upon him suddenly. He was even weaker than before. More frail. Lily did everything she could, praying her heart out. But she had her fathers faith, ""If I can't see it happening, it's hard to pray for."" they thought.  The day arrived sooner than he would like to admit, and he could feel it coming. The calm and clarity of a mind prepared to leave. ""Oh Lord, I long to See You. Won't you open my eyes?"" It was such a small thing, at first. A gentle ray of color. Cyan, to be exact. Then it was if the ice was melting away, and he could slowly see the room around him. Arrayed on every corner of his room on every wall, were paintings. Paintings he had cherished and not seen for years. ""My God...! What have you done for me?! I don't deserve it...! Did you do this for your Glory?""

# Chapter 8: Driving Lessons

**INT. KITCHEN - WEDNESDAY MORNING - 10:14 AM**

The morning light filters through the familiar kitchen window, casting long shadows across the breakfast table. Max sits hunched over a bowl of cereal, mechanically spooning soggy flakes into her mouth without really tasting them. Her hair falls like a curtain around her face, a barrier against the world.

Ryan and Vanessa move around the kitchen with the practiced efficiency of people who've shared domestic space for decades. Ryan pours coffee, Vanessa wipes down counters, both of them stealing glances at their daughter with the careful attention of parents trying to gauge emotional weather patterns.

The silence isn't uncomfortable exactly, but it's loaded with unspoken concerns. Max's distant behavior hasn't gone unnoticed, even if they haven't directly addressed it.

**VANESSA**  
*(settling at the table with her coffee)*  
So, your dad and I were thinking we could head to the mall today. I need to pick up a few things, and it might be nice to get out of the house.

Max nods without looking up from her cereal, a noncommittal sound escaping her throat.

**RYAN**  
*(settling into his chair, voice deliberately casual)*  
Actually, I had a thought. How about *you* drive? It's been some time since you practiced your driving.

Max's spoon pauses halfway to her mouth. She finally looks up, her eyes wide with something that might be anxiety or surprise.

**MAX**  
*(reluctant, voice tight)*  
Uh... yeah... sure.

**RYAN**  
*(beaming, missing or ignoring the reluctance in her voice)*  
Great. And you know the route really well already. It'd be great.

Max forces a smile that doesn't reach her eyes. She wants to share his enthusiasm, but her stomach is already knotting at the thought of getting behind the wheel. She's always been anxious while driving, despite having aced her driving test on the first try. The mechanics of it she can handle, it's the weight of responsibility, the thousand things that could go wrong, that make her palms sweat.

**MAX**  
*(trying to sound more enthusiastic than she feels)*  
Yeah. That... that sounds good.

**VANESSA**  
*(sensing the undercurrent of tension)*  
We're in no hurry, sweetheart. Just a leisurely drive.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. CAULFIELD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS**

The family sedan sits in the driveway, looking deceptively innocent in the morning sun. Max stands beside the driver's door, keys heavy in her palm, taking deeper breaths than the situation seems to warrant.

Ryan and Vanessa settle into their seats. Vanessa in the passenger seat, Ryan in the back, while Max adjusts the mirrors with meticulous care, clearly stalling.

**RYAN**  
*(from the back seat, voice gentle)*  
Take your time, kiddo. No pressure.

**INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS**

Max turns the key, and the engine purrs to life. She checks the mirrors again, adjusts the seat, anything to delay the moment when she has to actually start driving.

**VANESSA**  
*(noticing Max's white knuckles on the steering wheel)*  
Remember, you're a good driver, Max. You passed your test with flying colors.

**MAX**  
*(voice tight)*  
I know. It's just... there's so many things to watch out for.

She puts the car in reverse, backing out of the driveway with painstaking slowness. Every movement is deliberate, calculated, like she's defusing a bomb rather than driving to the mall.

**EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - CONTINUOUS**

The car moves through familiar neighborhoods at a slow, but decent pace. Max grips the wheel like it might try to escape, her eyes darting between mirrors, checking blind spots obsessively.

**INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS**

The silence stretches, filled only by the quiet hum of the engine and the soft sound of Max's controlled breathing. Ryan and Vanessa exchange a glance in the rearview mirror.

**VANESSA**  
*(voice carefully casual)*  
Max, honey, your dad and I wanted to talk to you about something.

Max's shoulders tense, but she keeps her eyes on the road.

**MAX**  
What about?

**RYAN**  
We've been doing some research, and we found someone we think might be helpful for you to talk to. A therapist.

The car slows almost imperceptibly as Max processes this information.

**MAX**  
*(voice carefully neutral)*  
Oh.

**VANESSA**  
Dr. Chen specializes in trauma and anxiety. She comes highly recommended, and she has experience working with young adults who've been through... difficult situations.

**MAX**  
When?

**RYAN**  
We've scheduled an initial appointment for Saturday morning. Just to see if it's a good fit.

Max signals for a turn, the clicking of the indicator unnaturally loud in the confined space of the car.

**MAX**  
*(after a pause, trying to sound grateful)*  
That's... thank you. I appreciate it.

**VANESSA**  
You don't have to thank us, sweetheart. This is what parents do.

**MAX**  
*(voice smaller)*  
I know. It's just... I'm not sure what I'm supposed to talk about.

**RYAN**  
Whatever feels right. There's no script for these things.

Max nods, but her mind is already racing ahead to Saturday morning, to sitting across from a stranger and trying to explain the unexplainable. How do you tell someone about time travel? About watching your best friend die and then undoing it? About the weight of playing god with reality?

She can't. She knows she can't. Which means there will be this fundamental dishonesty at the heart of any therapeutic relationship, this massive secret that colors everything else.

**MAX**  
*(voice quiet)*  
What if... what if there are things I can't talk about?

**VANESSA**  
What do you mean?

**MAX**  
I mean... what if there are parts of what happened that I just... can't share? With anyone?

Ryan leans forward slightly, his voice gentle.

**RYAN**  
Therapy isn't about telling every secret, Max. It's about finding ways to cope with what you're dealing with. Even if you can't name names, you can still work on the feelings.

Max considers this, taking a left turn with exaggerated caution.

**MAX**  
I guess that makes sense.

**VANESSA**  
And if Dr. Chen doesn't feel like the right fit, we'll find someone else. This isn't about forcing you into anything.

**MAX**  
*(voice warmer, more genuine)*  
Thanks, Mom. Dad. I know this isn't... easy for you either.

**RYAN**  
We love you, kiddo. We want you to be okay.

**MAX**  
I want that too.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. NORTHGATE MALL - LATER**

The mall parking lot sprawls before them, a sea of cars and SUVs baking in the spring sun. Max navigates the rows with the same careful precision she's maintained throughout the drive, finally sliding into a space that she backs into and out of twice before she's satisfied with the positioning.

**VANESSA**  
*(as they exit the car)*  
You did great, sweetheart.

**MAX**  
*(wiping her palms on her jeans)*  
Thanks. I always feel like I'm about to crash into something.

**RYAN**  
That awareness actually makes you a safer driver. It's the people who think they're invincible who cause accidents.

**INT. NORTHGATE MALL - CONTINUOUS**

The mall hums with mid-morning activity—mostly stay-at-home parents with strollers and teenagers who should probably be in school. The familiar sounds of fountain water and distant music create a white noise backdrop.

Max walks between her parents, hands stuffed in her hoodie pockets, occasionally glancing at store windows without real interest. Her mind is elsewhere, still processing the conversation in the car, the appointment looming on Saturday.

**VANESSA**  
*(stopping outside a department store)*  
I need to grab a few things. Nothing exciting, just some basics.

**INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - APPAREL SECTION - CONTINUOUS**

The store has that generic department store smell: a mixture of new fabric, air conditioning, and faint perfume from the cosmetics counter. Vanessa moves through the racks with purpose while Max trails behind, her attention scattered.

Max finds herself gravitating toward a display of soft cotton t-shirts, running the fabric between her fingers absently. The texture is soothing, a small anchor in the overwhelming sea of sensory input that is the mall.

**VANESSA**  
*(holding up a shirt)*  
Max, what do you think of this color?

Max looks up, blinking as if surfacing from deep water.

**MAX**  
It's nice. Very... blue.

**VANESSA**  
*(studying her daughter's distracted expression)*  
I'm going to go find this in a different size. Will you be okay here for a minute?

**MAX**  
Yeah, totally. I'll just... look around.

Vanessa disappears between the racks, leaving Max alone in the sea of hanging clothes. Max wanders aimlessly, her fingers trailing along fabric, her mind drifting.

The background noise of the store washes over her: soft music, the rustle of fabric, distant conversations. She's just beginning to feel centered when she hears it:

Laughter.

Children's laughter, bright and animated, coming from somewhere beyond the clothing racks. She can't see them, but she can hear their voices clearly: excited, joyful, the kind of uninhibited sound that only kids can make.

Max finds herself smiling slightly, drawn to the innocent happiness in their voices. But then, slowly, something changes.

The laughter begins to shift, distorting at the edges. What started as joy becomes something else, higher pitched, more desperate. The bright sound darkens, grows ragged.

Max's smile fades. She tilts her head, listening more intently.

The children are crying now.

Not just crying—*sobbing*. Heart-wrenching, desperate sobs that cut through the store's ambient noise like a knife. The sound is getting louder, more intense, layered with panic and fear.

**MAX**  
*(whispered, to herself)*  
What the hell...?

Her chest tightens. The crying is so raw, so anguished, that it makes her own eyes water in sympathy. Why would children be crying like that? Where are their parents? Why isn't anyone helping them?

The sobs grow more desperate, more heartbroken, until Max can't stand it anymore. Her body moves before her mind can catch up, pushing through the clothing racks toward the source of the sound.

**MAX**  
*(louder, urgent)*  
Hey, are you okay? What's wrong?

She rounds a corner between two clothing displays and stops dead.

There, in the small children's section, is a group of kids, maybe seven or eight years old, laughing and playing with animated enthusiasm. One boy is trying on a too-big baseball cap while his friends giggle. A girl with pigtails is spinning in a circle, arms outstretched, while her brother makes airplane noises.

They're exactly as happy and carefree as they had sounded initially.

Max stares at them, her heart hammering in her chest. The children glance at her curiously, noting the strange teenage girl who appeared looking panicked and confused.

**LITTLE BOY**  
*(to his friends, whispering loudly)*  
Why is she looking at us like that?

**LITTLE GIRL**  
*(giggling)*  
Maybe she wants to play too.

Max takes a step back, her face draining of color. The children continue their innocent play, oblivious to her distress. There are no tears on their faces, no signs of the heart-wrenching sobs that had driven her to rush over.

**MAX**  
*(under her breath, voice shaking)*  
What the actual fuck...?

She backs away, her mind reeling. Had she imagined it? Had her brain somehow translated their laughter into crying? That didn't make sense. It couldn't make sense.

**VANESSA**  
*(appearing beside her with shirts draped over her arm)*  
Max? What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.

Max spins toward her mother, eyes wide with confusion and fear.

**MAX**  
*(voice tight, controlled)*  
Nothing. I just... thought I heard something.

**VANESSA**  
*(following Max's gaze to the playing children)*  
What did you hear?

Max looks back at the kids, who are now engaged in a game of tag between the clothing racks. Their laughter, genuine, happy laughter, rings out clearly.

**MAX**  
*(forcing a smile)*  
Just... kids being kids. My imagination, I guess.

But even as she says it, she can still hear the echo of those desperate sobs in her memory. Her hands are shaking slightly, and she shoves them deeper into her pockets to hide it.

**VANESSA**  
*(studying Max's pale face with concern)*  
Are you sure you're okay? You look shaken.

**MAX**  
*(voice a little too bright)*  
Yeah, totally fine. Just... tired, I guess. All this stimulation.

**VANESSA**  
*(not backing down, voice gentle but persistent)*  
Max, honey, you rushed over here like something was seriously wrong. What exactly did you think you heard?

**MAX**  
*(deflecting, uncomfortable)*  
Mom, it's nothing. Can we just drop it?

**VANESSA**  
*(stepping closer, maternal instinct kicking in)*  
Sweetheart, you're clearly upset about something. You can talk to me. You don't have to shut off like that. Were you worried about the children?

**MAX**  
*(tension building in her voice)*  
I said it's nothing, okay?

**VANESSA**  
*(pressing further, concerned)*  
But if you're hearing things that aren't there, that might be something we should discuss with Dr. Chen on Saturday. Sometimes stress can cause—

**MAX**  
*(snapping, voice sharp and defensive)*  
Jesus, Mom! Can you just back off for like five seconds? I don't need you analyzing every little thing I do!

The words hang in the air between them, harsh and unexpected. Vanessa takes a small step back, her face cycling through surprise, hurt, and uncertainty. She's clearly not sure how to respond to this sudden aggression from her daughter.

Max immediately sees the hurt in her mother's eyes and feels a wave of guilt crash over her.

**MAX**  
*(voice immediately softer, apologetic)*  
God, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you like that. I just... I'm fine, Mom. Really.

**VANESSA**  
*(voice quiet, still processing)*  
It's... it's okay, sweetheart. I know you're going through a lot.

Vanessa doesn't look entirely convinced, but she forces a small smile and nods.

**VANESSA**  
Why don't we wrap up here and head home? I think I've got everything I need.

**MAX**  
*(relieved)*  
That sounds good.

As they walk toward the checkout, Max can't shake the feeling that something is fundamentally wrong with her brain. First the exhaustion, then the isolation from old friends, and now this—hearing things that aren't there, or at least aren't there in the way she perceived them.

The thought that keeps circling through her mind, unwelcome and insistent, is simple and terrifying:

*Am I losing my mind?*

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS**

Max walks slightly behind her parents, her mind churning with questions she can't answer. The spring air feels too bright, too sharp, like everything is turned up a notch past comfortable. A dull throb has started behind her temples, pulsing in rhythm with her heartbeat.

Ryan approaches the driver's side, then pauses and turns back to Max.

**RYAN**  
Hey, you want to drive home too?

Max takes the keys without thinking, her body moving on autopilot.

**MAX**  
Yeah, sure.

Vanessa glances at her daughter with concern but doesn't say anything about the earlier incident. She settles into the passenger seat while Ryan takes his place in the back, and an uncomfortable silence immediately fills the car.

**INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS**

Max starts the engine, the headache intensifying as she checks her mirrors. Every sound seems amplified: the click of seatbelts, the rustle of shopping bags, her mother's quiet sigh.

She pulls out of the parking space and merges into traffic, her knuckles white on the steering wheel.

The silence in the car feels oppressive, loaded with unspoken tension from the mall incident. Max can feel her parents' eyes on her, their careful attention, and it makes her skin crawl.

**EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - CONTINUOUS**

Max navigates through the familiar maze of Seattle traffic, but her mind begins to fracture, splitting between the mechanical act of driving and an overwhelming flood of hyper-detailed observations.

The red Honda Civic in the lane beside them has a small dent in the rear bumper shaped like a crescent moon, and the driver—a middle-aged woman with graying roots showing through her blonde hair—taps her wedding ring against the steering wheel exactly every three seconds while waiting at the red light. The traffic signal itself hangs slightly crooked on its cable, swaying almost imperceptibly in the afternoon breeze, and there's a cluster of dead insects trapped inside the red lens casting tiny shadows. To the right, an old billboard advertising a furniture store that closed six months ago peels at the corner, revealing layers of previous advertisements underneath like geological strata, and a seagull perches on the metal frame, its left foot missing two toes, probably from fishing line or—

*what if I just drove off the bridge right here?*

—traffic cone placed haphazardly near a construction zone bears the scuff marks of at least a dozen vehicle impacts, its orange surface faded to an almost salmon pink on the side facing the sun, and the worker in the hard hat standing nearby has a coffee stain on his yellow safety vest shaped exactly like Australia, and he's checking his phone every few seconds with the desperate energy of someone waiting for important news while the jackhammer behind him creates a rhythm that matches the throbbing in Max's temples, one-two-three-pause, one-two-three-pause, and the concrete dust hangs in the air like—

*quick and painless*

—microscopic particles that catch the sunlight and create tiny rainbow prisms, and there's a homeless man sitting against the bus stop with a cardboard sign written in blue ballpoint pen that's starting to run from the moisture in the air, and his dog—a mixed breed with one blue eye and one brown eye—pants steadily while watching the traffic with the patience of an animal that has learned to wait, and the bus stop itself has seventeen pieces of old gum stuck to its metal bench, each one a different shade of gray or black from age and weather, and there's a spider web in the upper corner that trembles with each passing vehicle, the spider itself—

*would anyone even miss me?*

—barely visible as a dark speck at the center of its perfectly geometric creation, and the web has caught three small flies and what looks like part of a dandelion seed, the white fluff now gray with urban grime.

She closes her eyes and tries to focus on her breathing, counting inhales and exhales like her mother had taught her during anxiety attacks when she was younger. But underneath the counting, a question echoes:

*What if Saturday's appointment comes too late? What if I'm falling apart faster than anyone realizes?*

The car continues through Seattle's streets, carrying Max toward home and toward the uncertainty of what's happening in her own mind. Her breathing becomes shallower, the world around her a dizzying blur of details and sensations that refuse to coalesce into anything comprehensible. Her grip on the steering wheel tightens until her knuckles are white. Subtle enough that her parents don't notice, but enough to send sharp pains shooting through her fingers. Breathing becomes a conscious effort, each inhale and exhale a deliberate act of will.

*In and out, Max. Just keep breathing.*

**CUT TO BLACK.**

**CUT TO:**

**INT. CAULFIELD HOUSE - EXT - DRIVEWAY**

The car pulls into the driveway, Max's hands still trembling slightly on the steering wheel. She kills the engine and sits for a moment, taking a deep breath before opening the door. She doesn't look at her parents as they exit the car, just grabs her bag and heads inside.

She rushes up to her room, slamming the door behind her. She takes her hoodie off, like it's suffocating her, tossing it violently onto her desk chair. She gets into the bed, and curls up into a ball, hugging her knees to her chest. She closes her eyes, trying to steady her breathing, but the headache is still there, pulsing behind her temples.

**MAX** (V.O.)  
Come on, Max. In and out. Just like that.

*Think of something nice. Chloe. Yeah, Chloe. Whatever she's doing right now, she's probably doing better, breathing easy. Maybe we can breathe together...*

Max recalls Chloe's deep breathing while she was sleeping. There were evenings when Max would just watch her sleep, fascinated by the peaceful rise and fall of her chest. Chloe looked so free in those moments, unburdened by the weight of the world. She would sometimes secretly just watch her. Sometimes for almost an hour—maybe more. Just watching her breathe, and that would help Max calm down. That impossibly beautiful face of hers, so perfect, it made Max's heart ache.

In that moment, Max realizes that she has never loved a living thing so much in her life as she loves Chloe Price. The realization hits her like a tidal wave, washing away some of the panic and replacing it with a bittersweet warmth and purpose. She is actively healing right now. Back in Oregon. The state that fucked her up in more ways that she can count. And now, that state is finally starting to *heal* her for a change. If Chloe is getting better, then maybe Max can too. Yes, she definitely can.

The panic starts to ebb away, replaced by a profound exhaustion. Max lies back on her bed, staring at the ceiling, letting the silence of her room envelop her. The headache is still there, but it's more manageable now.

*Hmmmm... Yeah...*

Max can feel her breath actively steadying itself. The simple fact that she is getting through this moment, however slowly, is having an euphoric effect, almost narcotic in its intensity. She feels a small smile tug at the corners of her mouth. Shortly after, she drifts off into a light sleep, the kind where dreams are just out of reach but the body is finally at rest.

**FADE OUT.**

**CUT TO:**

**INT. CAULFIELD HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING**

Max enters the kitchen, where Vanessa is preparing dinner. The warm light from the overhead fixture casts a cozy glow over the room. Max's hair is slightly disheveled, and she looks tired but calmer than earlier.

Max approaches the counter sheepishly, where Vanessa is chopping vegetables.

**MAX**  
*(softly)*  
Hey, Mom. Can we talk for a minute?

**VANESSA**  
*(looking up, concerned)*  
Of course, sweetheart. What's on your mind?

**MAX** *(hesitant)*  
I... I just wanted to say thanks for being patient with me today. I know I was a bit... difficult.

**VANESSA**  
*(smiling warmly)*  
Oh, Max. You don't have to thank me. I'm just glad you're feeling a bit better. We all have our moments.

**MAX** *(nodding, grateful)*  
Yeah. I think... I think I'm starting to understand that. And I appreciate you and Dad trying to help me with Dr. Chen. It means a lot.

**VANESSA**  
*(placing a hand on Max's shoulder)*  
We're here for you, Max. Always. No matter what.

**MAX**  
*(smiling genuinely)*  
Thanks, Mom. I love you.

**VANESSA**  
I love you too, sweetheart.

They share a warm hug, Vanessa draping her arms around Max in a comforting embrace. Max feels a sense of relief wash over her, grateful for her mother's unwavering support.

However, Vanessa feels her chest tighten slightly as she gets a sense of just how tiny Max has gotten. Not in the cute kinda way, but rather in the scary kinda way. Like Max is retreating into herself more and more each day, stress stealing her appetite and energy.

Vanessa makes a mental note to bring this up with Ryan later. They need to be proactive about Max's mental health, especially if she's starting to withdraw like this. She desperately clings to calculated strategies to help Max heal, but underneath it all, Vanessa feels like they're fumbling in the dark. It's weird that she didn't feel any of this second-guessing when she was trying to help Chloe. When it comes to her own daughter, Vanessa feels completely out of her depth. The realization makes her feel almost guilty as much as helpless.

Vanessa and Ryan have been suspecting that Max and Chloe might have held something back about what really happened in Arcadia Bay. After they left for Salem, they started to realize that their story had more than a few holes in it. Vanessa has been fearful that Max might be repressing some traumatic memories, and today's incident at the mall only reinforced that concern. Not knowing the full extent of what Max has been though makes her fear for the worst. Millions of scenarios run through her mind, each one more terrifying than the last. She knows they need to get Max the help she needs, and fast.

After they've finished dinner, Max can still feel the lingering anxiety from earlier today. Her fingers still cold and clammy.

Ryan sits on the couch, browsing through the channels on the TV, until he finds old reruns of *Tom & Jerry*, Max's favorite childhood show. How she used to love watching those cartoons while eating cereal in the mornings. The simple joy of those moments feels like a lifetime ago.

**RYAN**  
Hey, Max. Remember when we used to watch Tom & Jerry together? You used to love those cartoons.

Max is already staring at the TV screen with a hollow expression, almost tearful. She hadn't seen those cartoons in ages, almost having forgotten they ever existed.

She nods slowly, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. Already feeling a bit nostalgic. She perches on the couch, cuddling a throw pillow to her chest as she drapes a blanket over her legs, settling in to watch the show with her dad. She finds a comfy position into the couch's cushions, finally feeling warmth into her bones again.

The camera lingers on Max's face, capturing the subtle shift from anxiety to a tentative sense of peace; the bokeh hiding her dad's comforting presence in the background. Then, the camera changes focus to Ryan, who between watching the cartoon, steals brief glances at his daughter, almost as if he's trying to memorize this moment of fragile tranquility.

**FADE OUT.**

**FADE IN:**

**INT. CAULFIELD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - HOURS LATER**

The house is quiet, the only light coming from the soft glow of the TV screen, the channel now showing a feature film, *Jeremiah Johnson*. Max is curled up on the couch, already asleep, her breathing steady and peaceful. Ryan is no longer on the couch, already having gone to bed.

From behind the couch, Vanessa watches her daughter sleep, a mix of relief and concern etched on her face, the TV screen casting a soft glow over her face. She slowly approaches the couch, seeing if Max is truly asleep. She gently takes the remote from the couch and turns off the TV, plunging the room into darkness except for the faint glow of the streetlights filtering through the curtains. She hesitates for a moment, then lies down beside Max, pulling the blanket over both of them, and wrapping an arm around her daughter in a protective embrace.

**MUSIC CUE:** [Russian Lullaby ](https://song.link/s/6s72gTtINFLysCOQPkLamM) by ***Ella Fitzgerald*** begins playing.

Vanessa closes her eyes, listening to the steady rhythm of Max's breathing, feeling a deep maternal instinct to protect and nurture her daughter. The overwhelming feeling of being in over her head returns, but she knows that the only thing she can do right now is be present for Max, even if she doesn't have all the answers.

**FINAL SHOT:** Bird's eye view of the couch where Vanessa and Max lie together, the soft glow of the streetlights casting gentle shadows across their forms, as Vanessa gently strokes Max's hair.

The song continues as we...

1p2fr9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1p2fr9j/what_to_eat_during_your_first_month_on_glp1s/,"What To Eat During Your First Month on GLP-1s (Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro)","Starting GLP-1 injections like **Wegovy, Ozempic, or Mounjaro** can completely change your appetite, digestion, and relationship with food, usually for the better, but the first month can be a bit of a balancing act.

If you’re wondering *“What should I actually eat on these jabs?* here’s the full, realistic guide tailored for Northern Ireland.

Not influencer nonsense.  
Not meal-prep perfection.  
Just real food that works for real people here.



# 1. Golden rule: Small meals - Big meals

On GLP-1s, your stomach empties more slowly.  
Big meals hit like a rock.  
Small meals sit nicely.

Aim for:

• 4–5 small meals  
• half-portions  
• slower eating pace  
• no rushing, no forcing

If you’ve ever said “I feel full after 4 bites,” that’s totally normal the first month.



# 2. Best breakfasts for the first month

You don’t want anything too heavy or greasy.  
Think **light, cold, simple**.

Some easy NI-friendly options:

• yoghurt + berries  
• overnight oats  
• Weetabix with cold milk  
• a banana + a protein yoghurt  
• a slice of toast + a wee bit of peanut butter  
• low-sugar granola with light milk  
• fruit + a protein shake

Avoid:

• fry-ups  
• heavy bacon/sausage  
• buttery toast  
• greasy rolls

Your stomach will not thank you.



# 3. Lunch ideas that won’t trigger nausea

The key: **protein + something gentle**.

Try:

• chicken wrap (half is usually enough)  
• tuna salad  
• boiled eggs + toast  
• cold chicken + pasta pot  
• vegetable soup  
• small prawn salad  
• couscous + roast veg  
• turkey slices + crackers

Avoid:

• anything swimming in mayo  
• greasy cafe-style toasties  
• chip-shop anything  
• heavy curries at lunchtime

A lot of people on GLP-1s find “cold lunches” easier on the stomach.



# 4. Dinners that won’t sit heavy

Evenings tend to be the trickiest because digestion slows more as the day goes on.

Great options:

• baked salmon + veg  
• chicken stir fry (light, not oily)  
• mash + chicken breast  
• boiled rice + steamed veg + lean meat  
• homemade stew (light)  
• veggie chilli  
• turkey burgers  
• slow-cooker dishes with lean meat

Avoid early in the journey:

• creamy pasta  
• cheese-heavy meals  
• fried chicken  
• takeaway curries  
• pizza (sorry but she’s a demon on GLP-1s)  
• Chinese takeaway portions

You *can* reintroduce these later, just not during week one.



# 5. Snacks that work beautifully on jabs

Ideal GLP-1 snacks are:

• fruit  
• babybel cheese  
• crackers  
• yoghurt  
• nuts (a handful, not a bucket)  
• popcorn  
• rice cakes  
• hummus + veg sticks

Most people need way fewer snacks, but when you do, keep them light.



# 6. Foods that settle your stomach (GLP-1 lifesavers)

Your first month, keep these handy:

• ginger biscuits  
• crackers  
• flat lemonade  
• ginger tea  
• polos  
• salted crisps (small bags only)  
• cold water with lemon

If nausea ever hits, these fix it fast.



# 7. Foods that commonly trigger nausea

Every NI GLP-1 user learns this fast:

❌ greasy breakfasts  
❌ chip shop food  
❌ too much bread  
❌ heavy dairy  
❌ creamy sauces  
❌ spicy curries  
❌ large meals  
❌ fast eating  
❌ eating when you’re not hungry  
❌ fizzy drinks on an empty stomach

Not forever, just until the dose settles.



# 8. Drinks: what works and what doesn’t

# Best choices:

• water  
• diluted juice  
• herbal tea  
• peppermint tea  
• iced water  
• sugar-free cordial  
• warm lemon water

# Be careful with:

• coffee (start reducing if nausea hits)  
• fizzy drinks  
• energy drinks

# Avoid early on:

• alcohol  
Most people find alcohol hits differently and too sharply in month one.



# 9. Portions: think toddler-sized

GLP-1s reduce appetite so dramatically that a full plate becomes the enemy.

Try:

• using a smaller plate  
• stopping once you feel the first sign of fullness  
• chewing slower  
• putting the fork down between bites

Leftovers become your best mate.



# 10. NI-specific easy meal ideas (cheap too)

Here’s the realistic local list:

• M&S Fuller For Longer meals  
• Tesco chicken pasta pot (half only)  
• Lidl protein yoghurts  
• a wee pot of stew from the deli  
• Subway salad  
• Greggs ham & cheese baguette (half)  
• pre-cooked chicken from Spar  
• Quorn mince dishes if you’re feeling light  
• smoothie pouches on busy days

No faff. No prep. No food waste.



# 11. Your first month will look something like this

# Week 1:

Eating tiny amounts, getting used to slower digestion.

# Week 2:

Hunger signals change. Portions shrink. Cravings drop.

# Week 3:

Nausea reduces. Energy improves. You settle into patterns.

# Week 4:

Food choices stabilise. You’re eating far less without effort.

This is when most NI users say:  
*“I finally feel in control again.”*



# 12. What NOT to do in the first month

Avoid these traps:

❌ Forcing yourself to finish a plate

# Final thoughts

Your first month on Wegovy or Mounjaro is NOT about dieting.  
It’s about learning your new signals:

• slower digestion  
• smaller portions  
• different hunger  
• new cravings  
• fuller feeling

Eat gently.  
Eat smaller.  
Eat smarter.

I always thought productivity was mostly about discipline and getting into the right mindset, but after a while my wrists were getting sore, my fingers started fatiguing, my lower back was hurting, and my neck was also sore. After all that i started getting lazier, unbothered to work, after i realised why i started adjusting my workspace and setup so i can actually work without being uncomfortable FIrst thng i looked at was my posture and how i was sitting, my neck and back were in pain so i got a new chair, and luckily my monitor mount was adjustable so i just raised it enough for my neck to be more comfortable, also since i workout i started doing some excersises that will help with my posture, second was my wrists and fingers, got a leather wrist rest which is also aesthetically pleasing not just nice for my wrists which was also nice, got a keyboard with lighter switches so my fingers would be less fatigued and also got some blue light glasses cuz i thoguht what the hell, why not i might aswell. Hydration has been another one, i couldnt focus so i decided to start drinking more water and less coffee, and im feeling more energized. To drop coffe i started drinking chooclate milk, that way my dopamine risess and its a bit healthier too, also the enjoyment from the choccy milk also makes me focus better sometimes so i think overall its better than coffee. So far this has been good for me, more comfortable and has helped me focus on work more, and less lazy to work. I do work from home i did forget to mention that to clear up some confusion, and if theres any tips or suggestions you guys may have i wouldnt be opposed to optimizing my working process some more.

I tend to eat what I thought was a very healthy diet, with primarily homemade/homegrown foods. But also felt like crap after having baby - now we know its my gallbladder. 

Breakfast is usually a mix of eggs & homemade bread or homemade yogurt (from whole milk) and homemade granola (with nuts 🫠)

Lunch tends to be leftovers or canned chicken & beans. (Toddlers favorite meal) 

Suppers consist of all meats that we raise/hunt. (Beef, pork, chicken, deer, fish)
Most veggies are from our garden and frozen canned. 

I usually make our own dressings/dips with egg & oil, but am obviously refraining from that. 

I bake but not sure if I can continue to do that and eat things made with oils? Like muffins? Not sure if baking it changes the chemistry of it. 

I usually cook with tallow/lard/butter but have been trying to cook my meals separately from my families without it.

I do also use coconut oil and avacado oil.

I have a sweet tooth, LOVE dairy and I am at a complete loss as to what to even eat. I ate toast this morning with nothing on it and it just felt wrong. Ate my chicken and beans for lunch. Iced coffee with no milk. Ultimately i feel better but I want something 🫠

I’m living home while i plan my career or next move. My current circumstances make me feel alone, I don’t have friends. I have one person I talk to but we don’t hang out much, siblings in college. So this backstory is important because it’s as though I can’t relate to anyone. I opened up to my grandma or mom but my grandma tells me dating is more important (I never did) and friends will be hard to find and that this friend I’m writing about… I shouldn’t reconnect to. My mom and I don’t really talk so her advice was do what you want.


Had this friend I knew from childhood. We went to high school together. In college we were close and had the same major/ a lot of the same classes (small college) and always were together in and out of school, we had a lot of the same interest and for years things were great. some point she got new friends and I got hurt that the friendship was one sided. We didn’t ever really communicate and I assumed the friendship was dead. It was painful to watch her posts online so I removed her. I thought: why did she not care enough to message me, like I always did for her? For 2 years I figured I’d work on my own self. Not being clingy maybe that was it?


We came back in touch through being at the grad school orientation, we got coffee. It was nice because she was open to meeting again and said she’d love to hang out more, just tell her when. Etc. But I never saw her after... she followed my social for a bit but a while goes by and her social media just disappeared. 

Years later she got engaged and moved. But she’s back now, my mom apparently saw her mom. They kinda talk together. My mom said it won’t hurt to reach out. At one point my mom blurts: you used to be so lively what’s going on? You hardly talk to friends you shut down.


Im just scared trying to resuscitate a friendship when im in a place of not having my own friends and still figuring my career out. Feeling like im so behind/ others are well adjusted… it may not be  especially since people often say don’t go to the past. Did this friend show that she’s indifferent? Not that she hates me ofc but that she doesn’t really mind if I’m there or not.. What do you think? My confidence is shot because im applying to jobs and no luck. This friend lives like very close to my family home btw

It started june 2025. I was at a party and someone started playing stake. I was curious to watch him because I have never gambled, or never knew what this shit is. Never wanted to try also, always against this ideology. I have had a solid fight against alcohol and I had been clean for years now. I had no vices. I am a spiritual guy, always joyful. As I am writing this I kinda feel at peace only but this story is important for me to share because this is my closure to gambling. In that party I created my stake account, deposited 500 INR after getting inspired from that guy. He taught me how to play mines. It was going good. I made 1000 INR from 500 and then suddenly raised the bets and I went down to last 10 INR. I felt like a loser, I went to the washroom and locked myself in and started playing again from 10 INR with 23 mines placed and boom it worked I was back at 1000 INR. I was happy came out, partied and in the morning while going back home, I started playing again. Started with 100 INR bet on mine and slowly the bet size started increasing. Half way towards my home I reached 10k INR just by playing mines. I thought I was a genius. I played more, reached to 25k INR within 30 minutes(I was mostly playing a bet size of 500 and increasing it after every win, at one point I was playing bet size of 2k with 2 mines placed). I was locked in, something was brewing inside me, my dopamine receptors were getting fried too. I was feeling nervous. I reached home, went into my room, then locked in again. Withing 5-10 mins I reached 84k INR. From 10 INR to 84k INR I felt like GOD. Then my bet size increased to 10k, 15k and boom within 5 mins 84k INR to 0. I felt I am so stupid. I was in shock. I thought I did it once with just 10 rupees, I can do it again. Then started a series of D&D, I call it 'deposits of death'. Within 3 hours I was in negative 30K in my account. I was sad, depressed and self excluded myself immediately and promised to never play again. Went to a coffee shop, journaled about wtf just happened in my life. Post clarity was just regret and shame. While playing it felt like some demon had hijacked my body and I could not just stop playing. It wasn't me. Then a month passed by, I became normal. Started saving money from client work. Then one boring night I found another game online. I thought let's just play a very small amount and bounce, half n hour later I again lost 25k. Self excluded myself again. The same cycle of win-loss-chase loss- regret-shame has repeated till date for 10 times already, the last one being 30 mins back. I have already lost a lot of my hard earned money and I can't lose more. I seriously need this communities help to make me quit this shit for life. Right now, I am not in any sort of debt or anything. Thank god for that. The only issue is when I think about the losses, I feel my heart breaking not because of money, because I could have bought so many nice things for my mom from the money I lost to the devil. Something hijacks my body when I am a gambling site. Ofcourse you'all can mostly empathize with me but it's for me to take an action. That action is not taking my life of course, one should never quit life just because of some stupid gambling shit. The action is to share with someone so that it can help me process everything. The thing is there is no way to quit gambling addiction, the only way out is not to play. So today 21st November, 2025, I take a decision for my future self. I QUIT GAMBLING!

Big personality, sometimes she’s good to me, and sometimes she does things that make me really dislike her, but overall, I like my other coworkers a lot and it’s been worth it for me to kind of just keep the peace with her and just know that although we’ll never have a real friendship, we can certainly work together just fine. 

For context, we’ve all traveled together. 3 of the 4 of us go out for drinks a lot and the other does not drink. When we travel, they share a room and I get my own room because i can’t for the life of me share a bathroom or room with 3 other people ( I take an hour to get ready and honestly it would be selfish to do so in a room with 4 people ) but several times I’ve noticed the owner be a little bitchy because I insist on getting my own room. 

So, the other day one of my coworkers ( the apprentice ) said that they all ( the owner, co worker and apprentice ) all went to a coffee festival together this past weekend. I was like “aw that sounds fun!! Why no invite though lol” and she was like, “idk, I realized that when we were there that maybe we forgot to invite you”

For context, the owner is the one who orchestrates any events we do. Any hangouts, etc. so i would bet a lot of money that she orchestrated this going to the festival thing, and did not invite me. I find it really rude because she’s always saying “we’re the goonies! We’re a family! I love you guys!” But it’s just so fake. I feel like it was a deliberate exclusion of me. I’m wondering if I should put her on the spot and ask why I wasn’t invited. They also know I love coffee so it’s not like they would think I wasn’t interested- what do you guys think? In a small shop like this, feel excluded feels isolating. ",0,1763673153.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

1p2f8ia,https://i.redd.it/m0m63i0c9h2g1.png,What colors am I missing?,"Hi everyone!

I’ve had this ink collection for a while, and I’m thinking about adding 1–3 new colors that would round out what I already have. As you can see, I own plenty of Diamine and more blues than I probably need, so I’m hoping to branch out into other brands and shades this time.

[](https://i.redd.it/ummaarji8h2g1.png)

I’d love suggestions for inks that behave well in fine nibs. I’m open to shimmer inks too, I just want to avoid dry inks (like heavy shaders) or heavy sheening ones.

If you take a look at the image, what do you think would complement the palette? Ideally something easy/affordable to find in the US, since a friend will be traveling there soon and can bring a couple of bottles back for me.

A few ideas I’ve been trying to refine (but don’t feel limited by them!):

* I’ve always wanted to try something from Colorverse.
* I could use a brown, but what if Colorverse Coffee Break ends up being a bit bright and maybe too close to Diamine Ancient Copper?
* J. Herbin Cacao du Brésil is tempting (fellow Brazilian here!), but it might be too dark/near-black, feelike like a repeat from my Take-sumi.
* A yellow like Rohrer & Klingner Helianthus could be fun, but maybe it's too close to Honey Burst.
* Maybe a peachy shade like Colorverse Brunch Date.

But really, I’m open to anything—you might spot a gap I haven’t thought about!

*PS.: I set up that list in Notion, but the swatches themselves are mostly screenshots from Mountainofinks.com. The pictures I try to take from my own swatches never look anything like the real colors...*",5,1763673057.0,fountainpens,2,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1p2f5u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1p2f5u5/overview_of_my_november_trip_to_cuba/,Overview of my November trip to Cuba,"I just returned from a 9 day trip to Cuba and here are the details.

**How were you able to go as an American?** 

I traveled with a tour company that helped obtain an educational visa where my stated purpose was to ""to help the Cuban people."" To fulfill this requirement, we had a jam packed schedule of learning all about Cuban history and culture. It was exhausting but a great way to get to know a country and its people. The tour company helped with getting the visa (they did most of the work probably, until the end). 

We also did everything as possible to avoid giving money to the government. We stayed in homestays (""casa particulares""), ate at private restaurants, and patronized independent people for different activities. I didn't so much as enter a private store. Americans are required to do this to an extent but I recommend all people visiting be knowledgeable about where your money is going. DON’T stay in the resorts. 

**How did you get there?**

I flew in and out of Havana via Miami. In country, we traveled by van. 

**How much did it cost?**

The tour cost 1925 and I can’t remember the Visa fee (maybe $50?) and I forked up for the more ""premium"" version since I was joining my parents who prefer a more comfortable travel style. But don't confuse premium for luxury. Regular was a bit cheaper. This included lodging, most of the meals, almost all the activities, and tips for everyone but the guide. I brought $750 in cash for the rest of the meals (very cheap for huge portions), supplementary tips, souvenirs, alcohol (not covered but I don’t drink), and additional activities (there wasn't time for many). I came home with $454.

So total of premium tour plus additional was \~$2270.

**Did you feel safe?**

For the most part, yes. I live in a major US city and followed the same precautions. However, Old Havana is filled block to block with scammers. You get hassled \*constantly\*. While no one crossed the line into dangerous, it's still very intimidating and I would certainly not walk the streets alone after dark and honestly, I'd feel stressed during the day as a lone tourist. A solo man in our group walked alone at dusk and was constantly being offered a night with women prostitutes and when he firmly said no, they offered, “what about a boy?” Not man, boy. Yuck.

Also, as a mosquito magnet, I was petrified of the mosquito-born diseases epidemic. Despite living in 100% deet bug spray 24/7, three little assholes snuck past my defenses but no symptoms so far.

**What were the challenges?**

Blackouts: we were very fortunate that all of the places we stayed in had generators to keep basic functions available however air conditioning, WiFi, refrigerators, etc. were not able to run for most of the day in some areas. 

Sanitation: toilets and trash. This is more personal. I'm sure many have seen worse, including other members of my tour. But the streets full of trash in Havana were really unpleasant. Also, the toilets didn't have seats and you had to throw toilet paper in the waste basket. Some bathrooms were well maintained but more were gross. Again, I'm sure plenty have seen far worse but it was a mild challenge to me. 

Water: On the contrary, water was no problem. Our guide purchased two giant jugs filled with filtered water purchased from an independent business and we just topped up our water bottles from there. Also, all restaurants served bottled water. My fellow Americans on the tour ate raw veggies washed in unfiltered water or lemonade with unknown water and nobody got travel tummy. 

Restrictions: We were aware of all the American restrictions like no credit cards or ATMs so no challenges arose there. 

**What were the people like?**

Everyone we met (aside from scammers and beggars) were extremely friendly and welcoming. They were very patient in the face of my abysmal spanish and were happy to help by correcting me or teaching me new words. Most were very warm. I'd say some of the people we met along the way were the highlights of the trip.

**Where did you go, what did you do?**

Havana

* Old Town walking tour (I always love a walking tour)
* Cannon blast (overrated)
* Music show at Rosalia Castro Society (touristy but a lot of fun and venue was awesome)

This was a really hard city to like. Between the scammers, trash, and crumbling infrastructure, it was simply ugly and depressing. It has the bones of a great city to someday fill out but it's just a terrible economic situation here and you can see it. I would not go back as it is. The other tour members didn't enjoy it either. But as my mom said, sometimes travel can just be important exposure, it doesn't have to be enjoyable.

Parts outside of old Havana were better from what we saw but still not great. 

It seems crazy but I would recommend skipping the city entirely if you visit. At least in this state. Or if you go, make it a quick stop before seeing other parts of Cuba.

Out of fairness, I think we were a little kneecapped by our tour’s aim to give the least foreign money to the government as possible. There were probably plenty of decent museums we didn’t go to.

I’m sorry if this is very harsh. I’m trying to be honest. 

Viñales

* Las Terrazas former coffee plantation
* Tour of local farms, including tobacco 
* Fusterlandia
* Pinca Paraiso (restaurant with stunning view- go at sunset!)

Vinales was truly beautiful and perhaps the most memorable part of the tour. We had a fantastic tour guide of the local farms (named Orlando but idk what agency he was with) who made terrible dad jokes the whole time and was roasting the government savagely and hilariously. Our overall guide seemed a little antsy about this and I can’t help but wonder what kind of neutrality the company has to maintain to stay operating here (it’s Australian).

Seriously though, I can’t recommend Pinca Paraiso at sunset more.

Bay of Pigs

* Snorkeling 
* Museum

I always love snorkeling so that was fun and I finally saw all the Russians I heard visit Cuba on vacation lol. We didn’t exactly beat the same path from what I experienced. We did run into tons of Dutch people through our trip though. But the snorkeling wasn’t anything to write home about. Nor was the particular beach we went to.

The museum of the Bay of Pigs was super interesting to get the other perspective. What is seen more of an embarrassing political fumble than anything else by Americans is one of the most heroic and self-sacrificing victories in Cuban history. 

Cienfuegos (not long)

* Walking tour

We didn’t spend long enough here for an accurate read.

Trinidad

* El Cubano hiking trail and swimming in the waterfall
* Walking tour with a few museums
* Night out to live music clubs

Definitely my favorite city we went to, as was the consensus of those on my tour. That’s also what we heard from other travelers. It’s the most picturesque and really more of what you picture when images of Cuba come to mind. Pastel houses, cobbled streets, etc.

**Final thoughts:**

This was a rough time to visit. Things are grim and you can feel it in the atmosphere. They talk about the wonderful couple years when tourism opened up from the US and everything was suddenly hopeful. Their eyes go dreamy when they mention it. Money was flowing in and people started building things. But then tourism was cut off from the US (minus the exception) and COVID hit and everything just went to absolute shit, economically. The situation is desperate and deteriorating. 

So if you choose to come right now, it will definitely be appreciated big time but set your expectations accordingly.

On the bright side, we did see some beautiful things. The nature is stunning from the leafy green everywhere to the stunning sheer cliffs of Vinales to the shores we passed along the way. It’s simply a beautiful island and the weather was fantastic in November, despite a few short periods of light rain.

And as I said, the people were a joy. They were so grateful I was there and when I over-spent my US dollars on trinkets, their face lit up like I was handing over gold. Their friendliness really made the difference in how I felt about the trip.

My closing thought is that I hope to come back in 30 years and visit a version of Cuba that has fulfilled the massive potential they have. My heart is with them.",2,1763672889.0,travel,2,1.0,False

until 2023, when I quit in June and smoked again in July and August. In September I had my first panic attack, triggered by nothing, in the middle of a coffee shop with my mom and brother.

When I immediately googled the symptoms, I realized it was a panic attack. Then I quit smoking completely

Since then I have had 2 more panic attacks and occasional anxiety (which was very bad from September 2023 to April 2024).

I haven't smoked weed since then because I'm afraid I'll have a panic attack or more anxiety. because my first panic attack was like a bad experience with weed.

I smoked in February 2025 and I took 2-3 puffs. I had to control myself well then so I wouldn't have a panic attack or anxiety.

I feel really good now. I've been working a lot on myself and my anxiety.

I am very aware of what anxiety is and what a panic attack is and how it occurs, and I think I have great power to control it.

I am aware that I have a greater predisposition to anxiety and I am a very emotional person and I overthink a lot. I'm not like maybe some other people who can smoke and relax without any consequencesf ever. (but I could do that before).

now I would like to start smoking weed again. Of course, little by little, smoke by smoke. I'm wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences, positive ones?",0,1763672838.0,dpdr,3,0.5,False

We contacted Coffee N’ Comics via Instagram and repeatedly called the number listed at their Moana Lane address but received no response.   
  
The notice from October 17th indicates an administrative penalty of up to $5,000 can be imposed for any violation, asking this business which also has a location in Sparks and one inside the Renaissance Hotel to provide a copy of policies and procedures related to the complaint.  
  
If no policy is available, the letter asks for a detailed explanation of “what the company policies and procedures are for breaks and meal periods.”  
  
We received an email back from the compliance audit investigator who signed the letter indicating she was no longer in that position. A follow up email from the Office of the Labor Commissioner asked us to fill out a form which we did to receive an update about this complaint. We will update if we receive an answer.  
  
Current and former employees have sent more disturbing allegations to Our Town Reno concerning the work environment at Coffee N’ Comics, including what they call extremely low pay for managers, accusations of owners taking tips intended for workers, ownership not protecting employees against harassing customers as well as making sexual comments during meetings. 

Indeed listings for Coffee N’ Comics have baristas at over $22 an hour but several former and current employees have told us wages are much lower.    
  
A Reddit post was made several years ago describing how ownership was allegedly taking money from credit card tips, before promising to stop.  
  
The website for Coffee N’ Comics indicates in an origin story section that “Raymond Martinez and Alex Farside came together to try and create a coffee shop that feels like home. They wanted to create a space that is linked to the local community and continues to give back to the great people that support the store everyday. One day it might be a Power Ranger signing autographs, the next day it could be a fundraiser to help a local organization. Ray and Alex wanted to create a space that is friendly, fun, and a safe space for everyone in the community!”  
  
Its past events have included a Tuesday comedy night, a Friday night magic show and Saturday night cosplay karaoke, and while some of these are still ongoing, some have had less frequency in recent months.

Been 'friends' with a work colleague for 10 months, since Christmas. First 4 were long distance while he was abroad on a course, but we talked every day, got very romantic, flirty, suggestive, intimate, spoke about future plans. Like all intents and purposes were sort of building an inside world. 

He got back - we get drunk and hook up, only he rejected me physically while intimate. Completely smooths over this and said he didn't wanna complicate work but continues to talk all day every day, sends reels, talks about family, still flirts. Everyone at work over the last few months assumed we were seeing each other but just didnt want to ask. We live next door too, so had opportunity to spend time together.

We also have dinner together 4x a week, he sneaks out of the office to come sit with me for an hour or two, seeks me out, hangs out with me until 2am some nights. Has this little inside ritual of buying desserts and special treats and opening up and knowing everything about one another.

July comes, we get drunk again, lots of flirting, by this point I've accepted nothing is gonna happen because of the mixed signals. Get into his bed and he makes a move, but again rejects me when I reciprocated. 

Goes on holiday for 3 weeks and doesn't speak to me only to send me a lovely message for my birthday and to check I didn't go for drinks with a male ex colleague who is single and asked about me to him. Also to check if I went away by myself or if I met someone there?

Then comes back and we fit into this 'we' 'us' routine. He talks about our food, our evenings, our wants to do something. Just unspoken, we make each other lunch and dinner. Go to the movies, for coffee, he trusts me with his $9000 bike to ride. I need to stress its very friendly, less flirty but just very content in each others daily presence all the time. 

In a couple weeks period he takes me on three very couple coded dates, to cosy restaurants, spending all weekend together caring for each other, he buys me fancy steak dinners, cocktails etc. Takes me to a very cosy bar famous for something close to his heart he spent a lot of his younger days in. Gets me very drunk and then at the end of the night when I push a 'what are we doing' conversation, completely shuts down, avoids, refuses to even speak about it. The next day I feel mortified at possibly losing whatever we were, and I apologise and he pretended not to remember, comes into my house and acts like nothing is wrong and watches a specific close to our hearts trilogy of movies and gets takeaway with me. Just odd behaviour. 

This continues, he buys me coffee and makes me lunch at work andcwe share this duty and it's fine. Then just sort of starts ignoring messages, goes quiet, avoids me. 

Goes on holiday at the start  of October and then makes no effort to hang out when back, and I realise he is disappearing at night to see someone. I sent him a message saying if he wanted space he could just say, it was quite heartfelt and I admitted missing him and feelings but that I just needed space if he couldn't offer more and yeah. He always knew of the feelings though just they weren't spoken. Completely ghosted it. Didn't address it or give closure. Ghosted at work, apart from a few conversations where he acts completely and utterly normal and like nothing happened. Bought me nice teabags? Is friendly when has nothing to hide but when going to see the girl he's seeing avoids, deflects and ghosts.

I got into a car accident yesterday and he didn't even message to say he hoped I was ok. I've had 40+ messages from work colleagues. Nothing from him. 

I get he is seeing someone right and is all shiny for her, but he has completely abandoned and rejected me without closure, clarity or decency. No accountability or thought from him. He's perfectly fine after spending 10 months having this weird pseudo relationship with me. Literally everything but the sex And physical touch and talks of a future we. And I work with him, and live next door. 

He has hidden the dates and hookups he's had, completely lied to me about them. I had to find out from others he talks to like 10 girls constantly on his phone. Stories of him dating someone from work in the past and going on dates with other girls at the same time. Still is hiding this situationship/relationship whatever he now has too and when we talk he lies about seeing friends or his mom. I just don't get it? 

The only thing I can think is he is massively avoidant - he shows so many traits, would explain all the previous relationships he talks about. The constant need for validation. The weird pseudo relationship but never crossing a line. 

It's just this has opened up so much abandonment, self worth, not enough wounds in me... all I think all day is why her why not me? Why is she special, why didn't he step up for me? Why is he suddenly running, putting in effort with his appearance, deleted the dating apps he's compulsively used for months?

Marcala is one of the two main regions where our sourcing in Honduras is concentrated. These are some of our favorite offerings year after year, and this is sure to be a joyful cup this holiday season.

Las Acacias is one of a few small farms owned by the talented Roger Domínguez. Over the last eight years, we've purchased coffees from each of these plots, including the incredible naturals he produces at Finca San Francisco. This fully washed lot from Las Acacias provides the foundation for the blend, contributing notes of spice, red apple, and citrus.

Finca Caviflor, owned by Henry Urquia, is another farm in the same community as Las Acacias. Just like Roger, Henry produces excellent natural process coffees. This one contributes winey red fruit and provides more body to the blend.

1p2evr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/homecareinomakwa/comments/1p2evr0/welcome_home_care_in_oroville_wa_why_personalized/,"Welcome Home Care in Oroville, WA: Why Personalized In-Home Care Plans Make All the Difference","Every senior deserves care that reflects who they are—not just what they need. A one-size-fits-all approach may work for certain services, but when it comes to **in-home care**, customization matters. Personalized care plans ensure that older adults receive the right kind of support at the right time, while still preserving their independence and dignity.

At Welcome Home Care, [**in-home care**](https://www.whcwa.com/services/) begins with understanding the individual. That means listening to their preferences, respecting their routines, and creating a plan that supports daily life—on their terms.

# What Is a Personalized In-Home Care Plan?

An **in-home care** plan outlines the services, schedule, and goals for care provided in the client’s home. Personalized care plans are tailored to match the individual’s needs, health conditions, and lifestyle. This may include assistance with daily activities, mobility support, medication reminders, or companionship.

Rather than taking a general approach, personalized plans take into account:

* Physical ability
* Medical conditions
* Daily routines
* Personality and preferences
* Cultural or religious considerations
* Family involvement

The goal is to help the client live as independently and comfortably as possible in their own space.

# Building the Right Plan from Day One

Creating a personalized care plan starts with a conversation. Welcome Home Care begins by gathering information through an in-home assessment. This is an opportunity for the client and their family to share their needs, concerns, and expectations.

From there, a care coordinator works to match the client with the appropriate services, such as:

* [**Personal Care**](https://www.whcwa.com/personal-care-services/) – Bathing, dressing, grooming, and toileting assistance
* **Homemaking** – Light housekeeping, laundry, and meal preparation
* [**Companion Care**](https://www.whcwa.com/in-home-companion-care/) – Conversation, emotional support, and social engagement
* **Mobility Assistance** – Help with walking, transfers, and fall prevention
* **Medication Assistance** – Reminders and routine support
* **24-Hour Home Care** – Shift-based care for clients needing supervision [around the clock](https://www.whcwa.com/24-hour-home-care/)
* **Respite Care** – Temporary relief for family caregivers

Each plan is as unique as the person it supports. Services can be scheduled for a few hours per week, daily visits, or 24-hour care, depending on what’s needed.

# Flexibility as Needs Change

Health and mobility often change over time, especially for older adults managing chronic conditions. A personalized plan allows for flexibility—caregivers and coordinators can adjust services as needed.

For example:

* A client recovering from surgery may start with 24-hour care and later scale back to part-time personal care.
* A client experiencing memory decline may begin with companion care but eventually need mobility assistance or help with hygiene.

Because Welcome Home Care monitors each client’s progress, care plans are regularly reviewed and updated. This ensures the support stays relevant and effective without disruption.

# Promoting Independence

One of the greatest benefits of personalized **in-home care** is the way it supports independence. Rather than doing everything for the client, caregivers work alongside them—encouraging participation and preserving autonomy.

For example:

* A client might prefer to pick out their clothes while the caregiver assists with dressing.
* A caregiver might prepare meals but invite the client to set the table or help with light tasks.
* Daily routines are respected, whether that means a favorite breakfast at 8 a.m. or a quiet afternoon walk.

This approach builds confidence and keeps the client engaged in their own care.

# Peace of Mind for Families

Families often play an active role in a loved one’s care. Personalized **in-home care** makes communication easier and gives families peace of mind. Knowing that their loved one has a tailored plan—and that trained caregivers are following it—reduces worry and helps avoid caregiver burnout.

Respite care can also be included in the plan, giving family members regular breaks while ensuring that care remains consistent and compassionate.

 

# Building Relationships That Matter

Consistency is a key part of a successful care plan. At Welcome Home Care, every effort is made to match caregivers with clients based on compatibility and communication style. Over time, these relationships become meaningful—rooted in trust and familiarity.

A caregiver who knows a client’s favorite lunch or bedtime routine can provide comfort beyond the task itself. That connection is part of what makes personalized care so effective.

# Planning for What Comes Next

**In-home care** doesn’t need to stay the same forever. A good care plan not only meets current needs but also prepares for future ones. Whether it’s planning for more advanced support or simply adding services like medication assistance, having a personalized structure in place allows for smooth transitions.

This planning is especially important when a client’s condition is expected to progress, such as with Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, or post-surgical recovery. Welcome Home Care’s flexible services ensure care can evolve without having to leave the home environment.

# A Personal Plan for a Personal Life

**In-home care** is about more than assistance—it’s about respecting each person’s identity, history, and preferences. A well-designed care plan honors those things while making daily life safer and more manageable.

At Welcome Home Care, personalized **in-home care** means every detail is considered—from the way someone takes their morning coffee to how they manage their medications. It’s not just care—it’s care with intention.



**If you or an aging loved one is considering** [**In-Home Care**](https://www.whcwa.com/services/) **in** [**Oroville, WA**](https://www.whcwa.com/home-care-in-oroville/)**, please contact the caring staff at Welcome Home Care today.

David

The days bled combing through old files, hours spent staring at the wall, hours spent listening to the silence that now filled his apartment. The podcast had done its job; the city was listening. But the cost was becoming clearer with each passing moment.

He hadn't heard from the police since his interview. No calls. No follow-ups. It was as if they had gotten what they needed and moved on.

But David couldn't move on. Not yet.

The note he'd found in his mother's belongings—the one that had haunted him since childhood—kept resurfacing in his thoughts.

""She recite to him. I listened, too"".

What did it mean?

He needed answers.

He stood from his desk, restless. The corkboard near the wall was now cluttered with printed screenshots, hand-scribbled quotes, torn photos, and red thread connecting timelines. His mother was no longer a single file in a dusty cabinet. She was the opening stanza in a symphony of violence.

And now, the music was swelling again.

Elsewhere – Crime Scene Near the Past

It happened just after dusk.

A woman in her forties, walking home from the train station, took the long way down Eastburn Avenue—a narrow residential street bordered by chain-link fences and boarded-up homes.

The shot was precise. Clean. No witnesses.

Her body was found half an hour later, sprawled on the edge of a crumbling sidewalk just four blocks from where Cassandra Serna had been murdered in 94.

The crime scene was eerily minimal—no signs of struggle, no wallet taken, no personal belongings disturbed. Just a single object placed gently beside the victim’s hand:

A worn book.

Tucked inside its pages, was a folded note written in careful, deliberate script:

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

Detectives cordoned off the street. The book was bagged. The message was sent to forensics. But to anyone paying attention, the meaning was immediate and terrifying.

He was returning.

To where it all began.

David

He saw it first on a crime blog.

Then on a subreddit.

Then it was everywhere.

Woman killed few blocks from Cassandra Serna’s murder site. Victim left with book and note.

David stared at the screen, unmoving, as the words burned into his retinas.

His mother had a copy, once. It used to sit on their shelf when he was a kid. She read it to him, and he remembered the cover—the crown, the symbol, the name. It had captive him then.

It terrified him now.

He printed the photo of the crime scene and pinned it beneath his mother’s.

A circle was closing.

And the music was playing again.

at the station.

case files had a particular smell to them—aged paper, dried ink, and something more elusive. Like the breath of time itself. Sam Carter had spent most of the morning elbow-deep in the archives, the sound of creaking folders and rustling documents louder than the chatter of the precinct outside.

Torres stepped in, carrying two coffees. She didn’t even wait for a greeting before sliding one across the cluttered desk.

“You’ve been on that wall for five hours,” she said. “You look like you’re about to start speaking in haikus.”

Sam didn’t respond. His eyes were fixed on a folder dated 1998. The name on the cover: Elaine Brandon. A black-and-white photo sat inside, depicting a woman found in an alley—face turned toward the bricks, eyes half-lidded, like she’d been trying to listen to something only she could hear.

“This one was ruled a robbery gone bad,” Sam muttered. “No suspect. No follow-up.”

He slid the photo to her. Taped to the inside of the woman’s shirt, just beneath her right hand, was a scrap of paper.

Torres leaned in. “‘The quiet ones never forget,’” she read aloud. Her brow furrowed. “That wasn’t in the summary.”

“Wasn’t in the digital report either,” Sam said. “I only found it buried in the original scene documentation. The note was dismissed. Labeled ‘non-evidentiary.’”

She tilted her head. “And now you think it connects?”

“I know it connects.” He tapped the board behind him, where photos and notes had begun to form a constellation. “Cassandra Serna. Elaine Brandon. Jessica Nguyen. Eric Lane. Every message. Every signature. Same rhythm.”

“Why now?” Torres asked. “Why resurface after all this time?”

Sam stared at the red pins on the map. “Maybe he never stopped. Maybe we just stopped listening.”

Her phone buzzed. Torres glanced at the screen—and swore under her breath.

“We’ve got another one,” she said. “Southside. Three blocks from where Cassandra Serna was killed.”

Sam stood before she finished.

“Let’s move.”

The Scene

The victim, a woman in his early forties, lay slumped against the wall, eyes open. One clean shot. No signs of struggle.

Torres crouched near the body. “Same method. Same message?”

Sam didn’t answer immediately. He’d already seen it.

Near the victim’s hand lay a book.

The cover was aged, its spine cracked, but intact. Sam pulled on his gloves and opened the front flap.

Tucked inside was a folded note in a plastic sleeve.

It read:

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

Sam’s gut clenched.

The address, the timing, the message—it was all deliberate.

He turned slowly, scanning the shadows, as if expecting the killer to be standing just out of reach, watching the score unfold.

“He is getting close,” Sam whispered. “Where she died.”

Torres looked up. “Cassandra?”

He nodded. “It’s not just a murder. It’s a reprise.”

David

Something—intuition, dread—had pulled him from sleep before the sun had fully risen. The apartment was silent except for the hum of his laptop still running on the desk.

He poured coffee with a trembling hand and opened the email inbox for the podcast account. Among the sea of spam, tips, and media requests, one new subject line caught his eye.

“Southside. The King returns.”

No sender name.

Just a location. A set of GPS coordinates.

And a timestamp.

He froze.

It was a place he knew.

Elsewhere – The Keeper

He watched the news report replay on a muted television in the corner of a different room. Cleaner. More sparse. Just a chair, a table, a book missing its title page, and a single bulb dangling from the ceiling.

The reporter’s voice was silent, but the words scrolled clearly across the screen:

“Another body discovered near the 1994 murder of Cassandra Serna. Book left at the scene raises new questions about ‘The Whisperer.’”

He smiled faintly.

The tempo was shifting again.

And this time, David was getting closer to the melody.

1p2eux6,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1p2eux6/voidberg/,Voidberg,"Moises Maloney sat mid-afternoon in a cafe with several other cops, one of whom was a rookie. They were eating donuts and drinking coffee. One of the other cops said to Moises, “Hey, Maloney, why don't you tell the kid about Voidberg,” then asked the rookie, “Kid, you heard about Voidberg?” The rookie said, “No, I never heard about Voidberg. What's Voidberg?” and he looked at Moises Maloney, who finished chewing a chunk of his Baston Cream donut and said:

Once upon a time when I was just a little past being a rookie myself, I got a call to go out to Central Dark to deal with a pervert, *a flasher,* you know, one of those weirdos who runs around in a trenchcoat with nothing underneath exposing himself to strangers. In this case it was multiple calls that had come in. The guy was apparently exposing himself to children, upset one of them, who ran to his parents, who put a call in to the cops.

“The flasher was Voidberg?”

“Yeah.”

“Why was he—”

“I'll get to that,” said Moises, taking a drink of coffee.

“Let him tell the story, kid,” said one of the other cops, a thick-necked red-headed Irishman, who was barely chewing his donuts before swallowing them.

Moises Maloney continued:

So we get these calls and it's pretty clear someone has to go down there, but nobody wants to do it, so we draw straws and I get the short straw, so me and my partner at the time, Gustaffson (“Man, Gustaffson… rest his soul.”) get in our car and drive down there, but it's in the Dark itself, and it's a flasher, not a shooter, so we don't drive into the Dark but park outside and walk in.

Both of us are expecting the flasher's going to be long gone by now, because usually they get their jollies off and beat it, before one or other of the unassuming strangers they've exposed themselves to decides fuck that and beats their face in, and in this case there's parents involved, so forget about it, right? Well, wrong. Because even before we get there—and we're not walking very fast, mind you—we hear these short, wailing screams, just awful sounds. We think, what the fuck is going on? And it's not the same person screaming, so we know it's not the flasher getting beat. One scream, one voice, the next scream, another voice. And they're all so unfinished, like someone's taking an axe to these screams, hacking them in half before they've been fully expressed, and the unfinished half is shoving itself back down the screamer's throat, shutting them up. Never heard anything like it before.

The first person we see is this woman walking in the opposite direction from us, with two crying kids following her. They keep saying mom, mom, mom, but she's not even reacting, just walking like a fucking zombie. When she passes us I see her eyes: they're just *dead.* I say something to her—don't remember what—but I already know she's not gonna respond. She walks by us, the kids walk by us, and I look over at Gustaffson, who shrugs, but we draw our weapons because we don't know what the hell is going on.

That's how we come to the hill.

Central Dark's a big place and we're in this part where people like to hang out on the grass. There's the hill, which is usually pretty busy, and on the other side's a small playground, which is where the calls reported the flasher being. Today, the hill is empty. And we don't have to walk across it to get to the flasher—who, remember, we think is long gone—because he's right fucking there: on the top of the hill.

All around the hill's a group of people looking up at him, and he's pacing and turning round and round, dressed in a grey trench, like your stereotypical pervert. Some of the crowd's turned away, so they have their backs to him. Others are covering their kids eyes. The kids are crying. There are maybe six or seven adults walking like zombies, like the woman who passed us. And every once in a while somebody runs up the hill to get to the flasher, and he flashes them and they just stop, drop and curl up. Fetal position, like whatever they've seen's pushed them back through time and they're as helpless as infants.

Gustaffson shouts, ‘Police!’

Most of the people surrounding the hill look over at us, and we're not sure what to do. The flasher doesn't acknowledge us, but he's not armed, so I don't want to run up the hill pointing my gun at him, because that's gonna be a world of paperwork, so I say, ‘Hey, buddy—you up on the hill there. My name's Moises Maloney and me and my partner here are with the NZPD. You wanna come down off that hill and talk to us?’ He doesn't answer but starts laughing, and not in a happy way but like he's being forced to laugh, you know? Like he's a hyena and it's his nature to make a sound that sounds like laughter but really isn't laughter. If anything, he looks and sounds lost, confused, cornered He's not attacking anyone or even aggressively flashing them or anything. It's more defensive. Somebody runs up the hill, he flashes them to keep them away. Keep in mind he's surrounded too. He can't get off the hill. Anyway, I'm thinking he's a mental case, which jibes with him flashing random strangers in the Dark.

‘We're not here to hurt you,’ Gustaffson yells to him, and he means it. Gustaffson was a stand-up guy. For a second it seems the flasher's thinking of coming down to us. The crowd's gone silent. He's at least stopped spinning round, so now he's just standing there with his hands on his trench, making sure it stays closed.

Then we hear a gunshot—and all hell breaks loose—people strat screaming, scattering, no idea whee the shot came from, until four cops come running in from the other side of the Dark. Gustaffson looks at me. I look at the cops. NZPD unfiorms, but I’ve never seen any of them before. We try to get their attention, but they don't care about anything except the flasher, who's gone bug-eyed and is spinning again on the top of the hill, and I think, well, fuck, there goes our chance of talking him down. Not that I think it for long, because these other cops, they run through the crowd and start firing at the flasher. No warning, no hesitation, just ***bang bang bang.***

That puts the flasher into a real frenzy, and rightly so because he's getting fucking shot at.

Gustaffson strats yelling, ‘He's unarmed! He's unarmed!’ as I get over to the closest of the four cops, who tells me, ‘He doesn't have a gun but he's dangerous!’ and ‘Come on, help us nail this freak!’

But I'm not about to shoot an unarmed mental case, and I'm already imagining what I'll say in my defense, but also, as far as I know, these other cops don't have any authority over us, and Gustaffson's not shooting.

The cop who was talking to me shakes his head and runs after the other three cops, who are now chasing the flasher, taking shots, missing. It's a goddamn farce. It looks ridiculous, except they have real guns and they're trying to kill somebody. That's when one of them says it: ‘It's over, Voidberg. You're done. You're fucking done!’ For his part, Voidberg's not so much running away from them as running around them, keeping his distance but trying to face them at the same time. His hands are still on his trench, when one of the cops trips and falls and Voidberg—whose back is to us—stops, pulls open his trench like it's a pair of wings and he's a bird about to take off, off a cliff or something, and the cop, who's on his knees, trying to get up, falls over on his side and curls up into the fetal positon. ‘What in God's name?’ says Gustaffson.

I don't have time to answer, even if I could, because while Voidberg's standing there with his trench open, a gunshot rips into his shoulder. He screams, grabbing the place he's been hit, which is bleeding, the blood soaking into his trench. Gustaffson takes off up the hil. One of the other three cops gets to the one who's curled up while the other two run at Voidberg to finish him off. Maybe they would have done it too, if not for Gustaffson yelling *at them* to lay down their weapons. That little hesitation's all it takes. Voidberg gets moving again, but because he wants to run away from the pair of cops, he runs toward Gustaffson, and Gustaffson's holding his gun, pointing it—not at Voidberg but at the cops behind him—but Voidberg doesn't know that, and before I can follow Gustaffson up the hill, Voidberg opens his trench—

“Oh shit,” said the rookie.

“‘Oh shit's’ right,” said one of the other cops.

Another looked at his watch. “Time to go, boys. Break time's over.”

“What—no! What happened next?” asked the rookie, and Moises Maloney drank the rest of his coffee. “I need to know. Seriously.”

“Don't we all,” said the cop, the Irish one who'd just said, “‘Oh shit's’ right.”

“You mean none of you know?” asked the rookie.

“That's right. Long story, short break. Good old Maloney's never gotten past this part.”

Moises Maloney got up from the table they'd been sitting at. He started getting money out of his wallet.

“Damn,” said the rookie, getting up too.

“That's it?”

“What?”

“You wanna hear the end of the story but you're just gonna give up on it, just like that?”

“I thought you said break's over.”

“You thought it or I said it?” said the cop. The other cops, including Moises Maloney, were trying their hardest not to crack up.

“You… said it.”

“Well, I sure as shit didn't mean it. We're cops, kid. Wanna know who tells us when our breaks are over? We do. Nobody fucking else.”

Moises Maloney sat back down smiling. A waitress refilled his cup with coffee.

The rookie sat down too.

“We're just busting your balls, kid. Don't let yourself get pushed around, all right?”

“Sure,” said the rookie.

“So what happened next?” he asked.

Moises said:

Voidberg opened his trench right at Gustaffson. They were maybe twenty feet from each other. I was still down the hill, but I could see them. This time Voidberg wasn't facing away from me. I was at an angle but looking right at him, gun in my hand, and—

“What did you see?”

“Nothing,” said Moises Maloney.

“What do you mean, ‘Nothing?’” said the rookie.

“I don't mean I didn't see anything. I mean I saw nothing: a literal nothing. There was this emptiness in Voidberg's body, from his chest down to his crotch, but it wasn't a hole, you couldn't see through it to the other side. No, it was this deep, dark vacuum, and not in the Hoover sense, but in the sense of nothingness.”

“Fuck,” said the rookie. “*Void*berg.”

“I only saw it for a second—from a distance, an awkward angle, before I looked away, but even that was enough to shake me. I'll never forget it. I hope I never, ever see anything like it again. It hurt, you know? It hurt me *existentially* to see that fucking void.”

There was silence.

“What happened to Gustaffson?” asked the rookie.

“He went down. He went down and he never got up again, not really. It didn't kill him. It didn't kill anyone directly, but nobody was the same after. After it was all over, we got Gustaffson to the hopsital and he was alive, there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, but he wasn't the same. Same dead eyes as that woman we saw. Same as anybody who got flashed by Voidberg.

“When he got out of the hospital, they put on him meds, then used the meds to explain why he was different. He never got back on active duty. His girlfriend left him. Like, Christ, they'd been together ten years and she couldn't be with him after that, said she couldn't stand it. I asked her once if it was anything he did, like putting hands on her, and she said no, that it wasn’t about what he did, just the way he was. Nine months later he was dead. Clean, prescription drug overdose. No note. When I saw his body all I could think was, Fuck, the man doesn't look any different than when he was alive.”

“Sorry,” said the rookie.

“Yeah, well, me too. But the risk comes with the job—or the other way around.”

“I'll say what I've always said,” said the Irish cop: “I'll take a bullet to the head any day over something like that. That kind of erosion.”

“What happened to Voidberg?” asked the rookie.

“The two cops shot him in the back while he was flashing Gustaffson.”

“Died on the hill?”

“I don't know,” said Moises Maloney.

“You mean they didn't do an autopsy—or was it, like, inconclusive, or maybe you just didn't want to know?” asked the rookie.

“I mean that he was sure as fuck dying after they'd got him in the back. Fell over, moaning like an animal. But he was moving, breathing: wheezing. The two cops didn't want to get too close, and they'd stopped shooting. And then he kind of curled up himself, and pulled his head and shoulders *into the void in his body*, and when the upper part of him had disappeared into himself, he pulled the rest of himself into himself too and—*poof*—he was gone,” said Moises Maloney, snapping his fingers.

The rookie was staring at the black coffee in the white porcelain cup in front of him. Someone opened the cafe doors, they slammed shut and the surface of the coffee rippled because of the kinetic energy.

The rookie said, “You're busting my balls, right?”

“Yeah, kid. I'm busting your balls,” said Moises Maloney without a touch of sincerity.

He didn't see the rookie much after that, but one thing he noticed when he did is that the rookie never drank his coffee black. He always put milk in it—way too much milk, until the coffee was almost white.",1,1763672208.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

David

The days bled combing through old files, hours spent staring at the wall, hours spent listening to the silence that now filled his apartment. The podcast had done its job; the city was listening. But the cost was becoming clearer with each passing moment.

He hadn't heard from the police since his interview. No calls. No follow-ups. It was as if they had gotten what they needed and moved on.

But David couldn't move on. Not yet.

The note he'd found in his mother's belongings—the one that had haunted him since childhood—kept resurfacing in his thoughts.

""She recite to him. I listened, too"".

What did it mean?

He needed answers.

He stood from his desk, restless. The corkboard near the wall was now cluttered with printed screenshots, hand-scribbled quotes, torn photos, and red thread connecting timelines. His mother was no longer a single file in a dusty cabinet. She was the opening stanza in a symphony of violence.

And now, the music was swelling again.

Elsewhere – Crime Scene Near the Past

It happened just after dusk.

A woman in her forties, walking home from the train station, took the long way down Eastburn Avenue—a narrow residential street bordered by chain-link fences and boarded-up homes.

The shot was precise. Clean. No witnesses.

Her body was found half an hour later, sprawled on the edge of a crumbling sidewalk just four blocks from where Cassandra Serna had been murdered in 94.

The crime scene was eerily minimal—no signs of struggle, no wallet taken, no personal belongings disturbed. Just a single object placed gently beside the victim’s hand:

A worn book.

Tucked inside its pages, was a folded note written in careful, deliberate script:

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

Detectives cordoned off the street. The book was bagged. The message was sent to forensics. But to anyone paying attention, the meaning was immediate and terrifying.

He was returning.

To where it all began.

David

He saw it first on a crime blog.

Then on a subreddit.

Then it was everywhere.

Woman killed few blocks from Cassandra Serna’s murder site. Victim left with book and note.

David stared at the screen, unmoving, as the words burned into his retinas.

His mother had a copy, once. It used to sit on their shelf when he was a kid. She read it to him, and he remembered the cover—the crown, the symbol, the name. It had captive him then.

It terrified him now.

He printed the photo of the crime scene and pinned it beneath his mother’s.

A circle was closing.

And the music was playing again.

at the station.

case files had a particular smell to them—aged paper, dried ink, and something more elusive. Like the breath of time itself. Sam Carter had spent most of the morning elbow-deep in the archives, the sound of creaking folders and rustling documents louder than the chatter of the precinct outside.

Torres stepped in, carrying two coffees. She didn’t even wait for a greeting before sliding one across the cluttered desk.

“You’ve been on that wall for five hours,” she said. “You look like you’re about to start speaking in haikus.”

Sam didn’t respond. His eyes were fixed on a folder dated 1998. The name on the cover: Elaine Brandon. A black-and-white photo sat inside, depicting a woman found in an alley—face turned toward the bricks, eyes half-lidded, like she’d been trying to listen to something only she could hear.

“This one was ruled a robbery gone bad,” Sam muttered. “No suspect. No follow-up.”

He slid the photo to her. Taped to the inside of the woman’s shirt, just beneath her right hand, was a scrap of paper.

Torres leaned in. “‘The quiet ones never forget,’” she read aloud. Her brow furrowed. “That wasn’t in the summary.”

“Wasn’t in the digital report either,” Sam said. “I only found it buried in the original scene documentation. The note was dismissed. Labeled ‘non-evidentiary.’”

She tilted her head. “And now you think it connects?”

“I know it connects.” He tapped the board behind him, where photos and notes had begun to form a constellation. “Cassandra Serna. Elaine Brandon. Jessica Nguyen. Eric Lane. Every message. Every signature. Same rhythm.”

“Why now?” Torres asked. “Why resurface after all this time?”

Sam stared at the red pins on the map. “Maybe he never stopped. Maybe we just stopped listening.”

Her phone buzzed. Torres glanced at the screen—and swore under her breath.

“We’ve got another one,” she said. “Southside. Three blocks from where Cassandra Serna was killed.”

Sam stood before she finished.

“Let’s move.”

The Scene

The victim, a woman in his early forties, lay slumped against the wall, eyes open. One clean shot. No signs of struggle.

Torres crouched near the body. “Same method. Same message?”

Sam didn’t answer immediately. He’d already seen it.

Near the victim’s hand lay a book.

The cover was aged, its spine cracked, but intact. Sam pulled on his gloves and opened the front flap.

Tucked inside was a folded note in a plastic sleeve.

It read:

“There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life”

Sam’s gut clenched.

The address, the timing, the message—it was all deliberate.

He turned slowly, scanning the shadows, as if expecting the killer to be standing just out of reach, watching the score unfold.

“He is getting close,” Sam whispered. “Where she died.”

Torres looked up. “Cassandra?”

He nodded. “It’s not just a murder. It’s a reprise.”

David

Something—intuition, dread—had pulled him from sleep before the sun had fully risen. The apartment was silent except for the hum of his laptop still running on the desk.

He poured coffee with a trembling hand and opened the email inbox for the podcast account. Among the sea of spam, tips, and media requests, one new subject line caught his eye.

“Southside. The King returns.”

No sender name.

Just a location. A set of GPS coordinates.

And a timestamp.

He froze.

It was a place he knew.

Elsewhere – The Keeper

He watched the news report replay on a muted television in the corner of a different room. Cleaner. More sparse. Just a chair, a table, a book missing its title page, and a single bulb dangling from the ceiling.

The reporter’s voice was silent, but the words scrolled clearly across the screen:

“Another body discovered near the 1994 murder of Cassandra Serna. Book left at the scene raises new questions about ‘The Whisperer.’”

He smiled faintly.

The tempo was shifting again.

And this time, David was getting closer to the melody.

1p2euka,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmichorror/comments/1p2euka/voidberg/,Voidberg,"Moises Maloney sat mid-afternoon in a cafe with several other cops, one of whom was a rookie. They were eating donuts and drinking coffee. One of the other cops said to Moises, “Hey, Maloney, why don't you tell the kid about Voidberg,” then asked the rookie, “Kid, you heard about Voidberg?” The rookie said, “No, I never heard about Voidberg. What's Voidberg?” and he looked at Moises Maloney, who finished chewing a chunk of his Baston Cream donut and said:

Once upon a time when I was just a little past being a rookie myself, I got a call to go out to Central Dark to deal with a pervert, *a flasher,* you know, one of those weirdos who runs around in a trenchcoat with nothing underneath exposing himself to strangers. In this case it was multiple calls that had come in. The guy was apparently exposing himself to children, upset one of them, who ran to his parents, who put a call in to the cops.

“The flasher was Voidberg?”

“Yeah.”

“Why was he—”

“I'll get to that,” said Moises, taking a drink of coffee.

“Let him tell the story, kid,” said one of the other cops, a thick-necked red-headed Irishman, who was barely chewing his donuts before swallowing them.

Moises Maloney continued:

So we get these calls and it's pretty clear someone has to go down there, but nobody wants to do it, so we draw straws and I get the short straw, so me and my partner at the time, Gustaffson (“Man, Gustaffson… rest his soul.”) get in our car and drive down there, but it's in the Dark itself, and it's a flasher, not a shooter, so we don't drive into the Dark but park outside and walk in.

Both of us are expecting the flasher's going to be long gone by now, because usually they get their jollies off and beat it, before one or other of the unassuming strangers they've exposed themselves to decides fuck that and beats their face in, and in this case there's parents involved, so forget about it, right? Well, wrong. Because even before we get there—and we're not walking very fast, mind you—we hear these short, wailing screams, just awful sounds. We think, what the fuck is going on? And it's not the same person screaming, so we know it's not the flasher getting beat. One scream, one voice, the next scream, another voice. And they're all so unfinished, like someone's taking an axe to these screams, hacking them in half before they've been fully expressed, and the unfinished half is shoving itself back down the screamer's throat, shutting them up. Never heard anything like it before.

The first person we see is this woman walking in the opposite direction from us, with two crying kids following her. They keep saying mom, mom, mom, but she's not even reacting, just walking like a fucking zombie. When she passes us I see her eyes: they're just *dead.* I say something to her—don't remember what—but I already know she's not gonna respond. She walks by us, the kids walk by us, and I look over at Gustaffson, who shrugs, but we draw our weapons because we don't know what the hell is going on.

That's how we come to the hill.

Central Dark's a big place and we're in this part where people like to hang out on the grass. There's the hill, which is usually pretty busy, and on the other side's a small playground, which is where the calls reported the flasher being. Today, the hill is empty. And we don't have to walk across it to get to the flasher—who, remember, we think is long gone—because he's right fucking there: on the top of the hill.

All around the hill's a group of people looking up at him, and he's pacing and turning round and round, dressed in a grey trench, like your stereotypical pervert. Some of the crowd's turned away, so they have their backs to him. Others are covering their kids eyes. The kids are crying. There are maybe six or seven adults walking like zombies, like the woman who passed us. And every once in a while somebody runs up the hill to get to the flasher, and he flashes them and they just stop, drop and curl up. Fetal position, like whatever they've seen's pushed them back through time and they're as helpless as infants.

Gustaffson shouts, ‘Police!’

Most of the people surrounding the hill look over at us, and we're not sure what to do. The flasher doesn't acknowledge us, but he's not armed, so I don't want to run up the hill pointing my gun at him, because that's gonna be a world of paperwork, so I say, ‘Hey, buddy—you up on the hill there. My name's Moises Maloney and me and my partner here are with the NZPD. You wanna come down off that hill and talk to us?’ He doesn't answer but starts laughing, and not in a happy way but like he's being forced to laugh, you know? Like he's a hyena and it's his nature to make a sound that sounds like laughter but really isn't laughter. If anything, he looks and sounds lost, confused, cornered He's not attacking anyone or even aggressively flashing them or anything. It's more defensive. Somebody runs up the hill, he flashes them to keep them away. Keep in mind he's surrounded too. He can't get off the hill. Anyway, I'm thinking he's a mental case, which jibes with him flashing random strangers in the Dark.

‘We're not here to hurt you,’ Gustaffson yells to him, and he means it. Gustaffson was a stand-up guy. For a second it seems the flasher's thinking of coming down to us. The crowd's gone silent. He's at least stopped spinning round, so now he's just standing there with his hands on his trench, making sure it stays closed.

Then we hear a gunshot—and all hell breaks loose—people strat screaming, scattering, no idea whee the shot came from, until four cops come running in from the other side of the Dark. Gustaffson looks at me. I look at the cops. NZPD unfiorms, but I’ve never seen any of them before.

And they're all so unfinished, like someone's taking an axe to these screams, hacking them in half before they've been fully expressed, and the unfinished half is shoving itself back down the screamer's throat, shutting them up. Never heard anything like it before.

The first person we see is this woman walking in the opposite direction from us, with two crying kids following her. They keep saying mom, mom, mom, but she's not even reacting, just walking like a fucking zombie. When she passes us I see her eyes: they're just *dead.* I say something to her—don't remember what—but I already know she's not gonna respond. She walks by us, the kids walk by us, and I look over at Gustaffson, who shrugs, but we draw our weapons because we don't know what the hell is going on.

That's how we come to the hill.

Central Dark's a big place and we're in this part where people like to hang out on the grass. There's the hill, which is usually pretty busy, and on the other side's a small playground, which is where the calls reported the flasher being. Today, the hill is empty. And we don't have to walk across it to get to the flasher—who, remember, we think is long gone—because he's right fucking there: on the top of the hill.

All around the hill's a group of people looking up at him, and he's pacing and turning round and round, dressed in a grey trench, like your stereotypical pervert. Some of the crowd's turned away, so they have their backs to him. Others are covering their kids eyes. The kids are crying. There are maybe six or seven adults walking like zombies, like the woman who passed us. And every once in a while somebody runs up the hill to get to the flasher, and he flashes them and they just stop, drop and curl up. Fetal position, like whatever they've seen's pushed them back through time and they're as helpless as infants.

Gustaffson shouts, ‘Police!’

Most of the people surrounding the hill look over at us, and we're not sure what to do. The flasher doesn't acknowledge us, but he's not armed, so I don't want to run up the hill pointing my gun at him, because that's gonna be a world of paperwork, so I say, ‘Hey, buddy—you up on the hill there. My name's Moises Maloney and me and my partner here are with the NZPD. You wanna come down off that hill and talk to us?’ He doesn't answer but starts laughing, and not in a happy way but like he's being forced to laugh, you know? Like he's a hyena and it's his nature to make a sound that sounds like laughter but really isn't laughter. If anything, he looks and sounds lost, confused, cornered He's not attacking anyone or even aggressively flashing them or anything. It's more defensive. Somebody runs up the hill, he flashes them to keep them away. Keep in mind he's surrounded too. He can't get off the hill. Anyway, I'm thinking he's a mental case, which jibes with him flashing random strangers in the Dark.

‘We're not here to hurt you,’ Gustaffson yells to him, and he means it. Gustaffson was a stand-up guy. For a second it seems the flasher's thinking of coming down to us. The crowd's gone silent. He's at least stopped spinning round, so now he's just standing there with his hands on his trench, making sure it stays closed.

Then we hear a gunshot—and all hell breaks loose—people strat screaming, scattering, no idea whee the shot came from, until four cops come running in from the other side of the Dark. Gustaffson looks at me. I look at the cops. NZPD unfiorms, but I’ve never seen any of them before. We try to get their attention, but they don't care about anything except the flasher, who's gone bug-eyed and is spinning again on the top of the hill, and I think, well, fuck, there goes our chance of talking him down. Not that I think it for long, because these other cops, they run through the crowd and start firing at the flasher. No warning, no hesitation, just ***bang bang bang.***

That puts the flasher into a real frenzy, and rightly so because he's getting fucking shot at.

Gustaffson strats yelling, ‘He's unarmed! He's unarmed!’ as I get over to the closest of the four cops, who tells me, ‘He doesn't have a gun but he's dangerous!’ and ‘Come on, help us nail this freak!’

But I'm not about to shoot an unarmed mental case, and I'm already imagining what I'll say in my defense, but also, as far as I know, these other cops don't have any authority over us, and Gustaffson's not shooting.

The cop who was talking to me shakes his head and runs after the other three cops, who are now chasing the flasher, taking shots, missing. It's a goddamn farce. It looks ridiculous, except they have real guns and they're trying to kill somebody. That's when one of them says it: ‘It's over, Voidberg. You're done. You're fucking done!’ For his part, Voidberg's not so much running away from them as running around them, keeping his distance but trying to face them at the same time. His hands are still on his trench, when one of the cops trips and falls and Voidberg—whose back is to us—stops, pulls open his trench like it's a pair of wings and he's a bird about to take off, off a cliff or something, and the cop, who's on his knees, trying to get up, falls over on his side and curls up into the fetal positon. ‘What in God's name?’ says Gustaffson.

I don't have time to answer, even if I could, because while Voidberg's standing there with his trench open, a gunshot rips into his shoulder. He screams, grabbing the place he's been hit, which is bleeding, the blood soaking into his trench. Gustaffson takes off up the hil. One of the other three cops gets to the one who's curled up while the other two run at Voidberg to finish him off. Maybe they would have done it too, if not for Gustaffson yelling *at them* to lay down their weapons. That little hesitation's all it takes. Voidberg gets moving again, but because he wants to run away from the pair of cops, he runs toward Gustaffson, and Gustaffson's holding his gun, pointing it—not at Voidberg but at the cops behind him—but Voidberg doesn't know that, and before I can follow Gustaffson up the hill, Voidberg opens his trench—

“Oh shit,” said the rookie.

“‘Oh shit's’ right,” said one of the other cops.

Another looked at his watch. “Time to go, boys. Break time's over.”

“What—no! What happened next?” asked the rookie, and Moises Maloney drank the rest of his coffee. “I need to know. Seriously.”

“Don't we all,” said the cop, the Irish one who'd just said, “‘Oh shit's’ right.”

“You mean none of you know?” asked the rookie.

“That's right. Long story, short break. Good old Maloney's never gotten past this part.”

Moises Maloney got up from the table they'd been sitting at. He started getting money out of his wallet.

“Damn,” said the rookie, getting up too.

“That's it?”

“What?”

“You wanna hear the end of the story but you're just gonna give up on it, just like that?”

“I thought you said break's over.”

“You thought it or I said it?” said the cop. The other cops, including Moises Maloney, were trying their hardest not to crack up.

“You… said it.”

“Well, I sure as shit didn't mean it. We're cops, kid. Wanna know who tells us when our breaks are over? We do. Nobody fucking else.”

Moises Maloney sat back down smiling. A waitress refilled his cup with coffee.

The rookie sat down too.

“We're just busting your balls, kid. Don't let yourself get pushed around, all right?”

“Sure,” said the rookie.

“So what happened next?” he asked.

Moises said:

Voidberg opened his trench right at Gustaffson. They were maybe twenty feet from each other. I was still down the hill, but I could see them. This time Voidberg wasn't facing away from me. I was at an angle but looking right at him, gun in my hand, and—

“What did you see?”

“Nothing,” said Moises Maloney.

“What do you mean, ‘Nothing?’” said the rookie.

“I don't mean I didn't see anything. I mean I saw nothing: a literal nothing. There was this emptiness in Voidberg's body, from his chest down to his crotch, but it wasn't a hole, you couldn't see through it to the other side. No, it was this deep, dark vacuum, and not in the Hoover sense, but in the sense of nothingness.”

“Fuck,” said the rookie. “*Void*berg.”

“I only saw it for a second—from a distance, an awkward angle, before I looked away, but even that was enough to shake me. I'll never forget it. I hope I never, ever see anything like it again. It hurt, you know? It hurt me *existentially* to see that fucking void.”

There was silence.

“What happened to Gustaffson?” asked the rookie.

“He went down. He went down and he never got up again, not really. It didn't kill him. It didn't kill anyone directly, but nobody was the same after. After it was all over, we got Gustaffson to the hopsital and he was alive, there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, but he wasn't the same. Same dead eyes as that woman we saw. Same as anybody who got flashed by Voidberg.

“When he got out of the hospital, they put on him meds, then used the meds to explain why he was different. He never got back on active duty. His girlfriend left him. Like, Christ, they'd been together ten years and she couldn't be with him after that, said she couldn't stand it. I asked her once if it was anything he did, like putting hands on her, and she said no, that it wasn’t about what he did, just the way he was. Nine months later he was dead. Clean, prescription drug overdose. No note. When I saw his body all I could think was, Fuck, the man doesn't look any different than when he was alive.”

“Sorry,” said the rookie.

“Yeah, well, me too. But the risk comes with the job—or the other way around.”

“I'll say what I've always said,” said the Irish cop: “I'll take a bullet to the head any day over something like that. That kind of erosion.”

“What happened to Voidberg?” asked the rookie.

“The two cops shot him in the back while he was flashing Gustaffson.”

“Died on the hill?”

“I don't know,” said Moises Maloney.

“You mean they didn't do an autopsy—or was it, like, inconclusive, or maybe you just didn't want to know?” asked the rookie.

“I mean that he was sure as fuck dying after they'd got him in the back. Fell over, moaning like an animal. But he was moving, breathing: wheezing. The two cops didn't want to get too close, and they'd stopped shooting. And then he kind of curled up himself, and pulled his head and shoulders *into the void in his body*, and when the upper part of him had disappeared into himself, he pulled the rest of himself into himself too and—*poof*—he was gone,” said Moises Maloney, snapping his fingers.

The rookie was staring at the black coffee in the white porcelain cup in front of him. Someone opened the cafe doors, they slammed shut and the surface of the coffee rippled because of the kinetic energy.

The rookie said, “You're busting my balls, right?”

“Yeah, kid. I'm busting your balls,” said Moises Maloney without a touch of sincerity.

He didn't see the rookie much after that, but one thing he noticed when he did is that the rookie never drank his coffee black. He always put milk in it—way too much milk, until the coffee was almost white.",1,1763672167.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

He is my first dog, so some of the mistakes were due to inexperience, but I’m learning now.

The last time he nipped me, I still can’t identify a clear trigger. I was carrying two coffee mugs and walking normally. He was following me like always. Then I  stopped in front of the doors to pass the closed one, or open it (don't remember why) and he stopped too. He sat in front of the living room doors and stared at me, and a second later he lunged/nipped.

Now that I look back, I think he may have sensed my tension when I stopped moving and accidentally held eye contact longer than usual. I also realized I may have created a guarding association with the living room because I did “find the treat” games and puzzle feeders there.

Because I still don’t fully understand why he bit me, I’ve become very anxious. It's been a week since the incident and nothing else happened, but I almost had a panic attack while feeding him two days ago, and now I avoid walking around the house normally because I feel scared and I know he senses that fear.

1p2eu0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1p2eu0g/voidberg/,Voidberg,"Moises Maloney sat mid-afternoon in a cafe with several other cops, one of whom was a rookie. They were eating donuts and drinking coffee. One of the other cops said to Moises, “Hey, Maloney, why don't you tell the kid about Voidberg,” then asked the rookie, “Kid, you heard about Voidberg?” The rookie said, “No, I never heard about Voidberg. What's Voidberg?” and he looked at Moises Maloney, who finished chewing a chunk of his Baston Cream donut and said:

Once upon a time when I was just a little past being a rookie myself, I got a call to go out to Central Dark to deal with a pervert, *a flasher,* you know, one of those weirdos who runs around in a trenchcoat with nothing underneath exposing himself to strangers. In this case it was multiple calls that had come in. The guy was apparently exposing himself to children, upset one of them, who ran to his parents, who put a call in to the cops.

“The flasher was Voidberg?”

“Yeah.”

“Why was he—”

“I'll get to that,” said Moises, taking a drink of coffee.

“Let him tell the story, kid,” said one of the other cops, a thick-necked red-headed Irishman, who was barely chewing his donuts before swallowing them.

Moises Maloney continued:

So we get these calls and it's pretty clear someone has to go down there, but nobody wants to do it, so we draw straws and I get the short straw, so me and my partner at the time, Gustaffson (“Man, Gustaffson… rest his soul.”) get in our car and drive down there, but it's in the Dark itself, and it's a flasher, not a shooter, so we don't drive into the Dark but park outside and walk in.

Both of us are expecting the flasher's going to be long gone by now, because usually they get their jollies off and beat it, before one or other of the unassuming strangers they've exposed themselves to decides fuck that and beats their face in, and in this case there's parents involved, so forget about it, right? Well, wrong. Because even before we get there—and we're not walking very fast, mind you—we hear these short, wailing screams, just awful sounds. We think, what the fuck is going on?

Some of the crowd's turned away, so they have their backs to him. Others are covering their kids eyes. The kids are crying. There are maybe six or seven adults walking like zombies, like the woman who passed us. And every once in a while somebody runs up the hill to get to the flasher, and he flashes them and they just stop, drop and curl up. Fetal position, like whatever they've seen's pushed them back through time and they're as helpless as infants.

Gustaffson shouts, ‘Police!’

Most of the people surrounding the hill look over at us, and we're not sure what to do. The flasher doesn't acknowledge us, but he's not armed, so I don't want to run up the hill pointing my gun at him, because that's gonna be a world of paperwork, so I say, ‘Hey, buddy—you up on the hill there. My name's Moises Maloney and me and my partner here are with the NZPD. You wanna come down off that hill and talk to us?’ He doesn't answer but starts laughing, and not in a happy way but like he's being forced to laugh, you know? Like he's a hyena and it's his nature to make a sound that sounds like laughter but really isn't laughter. If anything, he looks and sounds lost, confused, cornered He's not attacking anyone or even aggressively flashing them or anything. It's more defensive. Somebody runs up the hill, he flashes them to keep them away. Keep in mind he's surrounded too. He can't get off the hill. Anyway, I'm thinking he's a mental case, which jibes with him flashing random strangers in the Dark.

‘We're not here to hurt you,’ Gustaffson yells to him, and he means it. Gustaffson was a stand-up guy. For a second it seems the flasher's thinking of coming down to us. The crowd's gone silent. He's at least stopped spinning round, so now he's just standing there with his hands on his trench, making sure it stays closed.

Then we hear a gunshot—and all hell breaks loose—people strat screaming, scattering, no idea whee the shot came from, until four cops come running in from the other side of the Dark. Gustaffson looks at me. I look at the cops. NZPD unfiorms, but I’ve never seen any of them before. We try to get their attention, but they don't care about anything except the flasher, who's gone bug-eyed and is spinning again on the top of the hill, and I think, well, fuck, there goes our chance of talking him down. Not that I think it for long, because these other cops, they run through the crowd and start firing at the flasher. No warning, no hesitation, just ***bang bang bang.***

That puts the flasher into a real frenzy, and rightly so because he's getting fucking shot at.

Gustaffson strats yelling, ‘He's unarmed! He's unarmed!’ as I get over to the closest of the four cops, who tells me, ‘He doesn't have a gun but he's dangerous!’ and ‘Come on, help us nail this freak!’

But I'm not about to shoot an unarmed mental case, and I'm already imagining what I'll say in my defense, but also, as far as I know, these other cops don't have any authority over us, and Gustaffson's not shooting.

The cop who was talking to me shakes his head and runs after the other three cops, who are now chasing the flasher, taking shots, missing. It's a goddamn farce. It looks ridiculous, except they have real guns and they're trying to kill somebody. That's when one of them says it: ‘It's over, Voidberg. You're done. You're fucking done!’ For his part, Voidberg's not so much running away from them as running around them, keeping his distance but trying to face them at the same time. His hands are still on his trench, when one of the cops trips and falls and Voidberg—whose back is to us—stops, pulls open his trench like it's a pair of wings and he's a bird about to take off, off a cliff or something, and the cop, who's on his knees, trying to get up, falls over on his side and curls up into the fetal positon. ‘What in God's name?’ says Gustaffson.

I don't have time to answer, even if I could, because while Voidberg's standing there with his trench open, a gunshot rips into his shoulder. He screams, grabbing the place he's been hit, which is bleeding, the blood soaking into his trench. Gustaffson takes off up the hil. One of the other three cops gets to the one who's curled up while the other two run at Voidberg to finish him off. Maybe they would have done it too, if not for Gustaffson yelling *at them* to lay down their weapons. That little hesitation's all it takes. Voidberg gets moving again, but because he wants to run away from the pair of cops, he runs toward Gustaffson, and Gustaffson's holding his gun, pointing it—not at Voidberg but at the cops behind him—but Voidberg doesn't know that, and before I can follow Gustaffson up the hill, Voidberg opens his trench—

“Oh shit,” said the rookie.

“‘Oh shit's’ right,” said one of the other cops.

Another looked at his watch. “Time to go, boys. Break time's over.”

“What—no! What happened next?” asked the rookie, and Moises Maloney drank the rest of his coffee. “I need to know. Seriously.”

“Don't we all,” said the cop, the Irish one who'd just said, “‘Oh shit's’ right.”

“You mean none of you know?” asked the rookie.

“That's right. Long story, short break. Good old Maloney's never gotten past this part.”

Moises Maloney got up from the table they'd been sitting at. He started getting money out of his wallet.

“Damn,” said the rookie, getting up too.

“That's it?”

“What?”

“You wanna hear the end of the story but you're just gonna give up on it, just like that?”

“I thought you said break's over.”

“You thought it or I said it?” said the cop. The other cops, including Moises Maloney, were trying their hardest not to crack up.

“You… said it.”

“Well, I sure as shit didn't mean it. We're cops, kid. Wanna know who tells us when our breaks are over? We do. Nobody fucking else.”

Moises Maloney sat back down smiling. A waitress refilled his cup with coffee.

The rookie sat down too.

“We're just busting your balls, kid. Don't let yourself get pushed around, all right?”

“Sure,” said the rookie.

“So what happened next?” he asked.

Moises said:

Voidberg opened his trench right at Gustaffson. They were maybe twenty feet from each other. I was still down the hill, but I could see them. This time Voidberg wasn't facing away from me. I was at an angle but looking right at him, gun in my hand, and—

“What did you see?”

“Nothing,” said Moises Maloney.

“What do you mean, ‘Nothing?’” said the rookie.

“I don't mean I didn't see anything. I mean I saw nothing: a literal nothing. There was this emptiness in Voidberg's body, from his chest down to his crotch, but it wasn't a hole, you couldn't see through it to the other side. No, it was this deep, dark vacuum, and not in the Hoover sense, but in the sense of nothingness.”

“Fuck,” said the rookie. “*Void*berg.”

“I only saw it for a second—from a distance, an awkward angle, before I looked away, but even that was enough to shake me. I'll never forget it. I hope I never, ever see anything like it again. It hurt, you know? It hurt me *existentially* to see that fucking void.”

There was silence.

“What happened to Gustaffson?” asked the rookie.

“He went down. He went down and he never got up again, not really. It didn't kill him. It didn't kill anyone directly, but nobody was the same after. After it was all over, we got Gustaffson to the hopsital and he was alive, there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, but he wasn't the same. Same dead eyes as that woman we saw. Same as anybody who got flashed by Voidberg.

“When he got out of the hospital, they put on him meds, then used the meds to explain why he was different. He never got back on active duty. His girlfriend left him. Like, Christ, they'd been together ten years and she couldn't be with him after that, said she couldn't stand it. I asked her once if it was anything he did, like putting hands on her, and she said no, that it wasn’t about what he did, just the way he was. Nine months later he was dead. Clean, prescription drug overdose. No note. When I saw his body all I could think was, Fuck, the man doesn't look any different than when he was alive.”

“Sorry,” said the rookie.

“Yeah, well, me too. But the risk comes with the job—or the other way around.”

“I'll say what I've always said,” said the Irish cop: “I'll take a bullet to the head any day over something like that. That kind of erosion.”

“What happened to Voidberg?” asked the rookie.

“The two cops shot him in the back while he was flashing Gustaffson.”

“Died on the hill?”

“I don't know,” said Moises Maloney.

“You mean they didn't do an autopsy—or was it, like, inconclusive, or maybe you just didn't want to know?” asked the rookie.

“I mean that he was sure as fuck dying after they'd got him in the back. Fell over, moaning like an animal. But he was moving, breathing: wheezing. The two cops didn't want to get too close, and they'd stopped shooting. And then he kind of curled up himself, and pulled his head and shoulders *into the void in his body*, and when the upper part of him had disappeared into himself, he pulled the rest of himself into himself too and—*poof*—he was gone,” said Moises Maloney, snapping his fingers.

The rookie was staring at the black coffee in the white porcelain cup in front of him. Someone opened the cafe doors, they slammed shut and the surface of the coffee rippled because of the kinetic energy.

The rookie said, “You're busting my balls, right?”

“Yeah, kid. I'm busting your balls,” said Moises Maloney without a touch of sincerity.

He didn't see the rookie much after that, but one thing he noticed when he did is that the rookie never drank his coffee black. He always put milk in it—way too much milk, until the coffee was almost white.",1,1763672138.0,deepnightsociety,1,1.0,False
1p2etk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1p2etk3/voidberg/,Voidberg,"Moises Maloney sat mid-afternoon in a cafe with several other cops, one of whom was a rookie. They were eating donuts and drinking coffee. One of the other cops said to Moises, “Hey, Maloney, why don't you tell the kid about Voidberg,” then asked the rookie, “Kid, you heard about Voidberg?” The rookie said, “No, I never heard about Voidberg. What's Voidberg?” and he looked at Moises Maloney, who finished chewing a chunk of his Baston Cream donut and said:

Once upon a time when I was just a little past being a rookie myself, I got a call to go out to Central Dark to deal with a pervert, *a flasher,* you know, one of those weirdos who runs around in a trenchcoat with nothing underneath exposing himself to strangers. In this case it was multiple calls that had come in. The guy was apparently exposing himself to children, upset one of them, who ran to his parents, who put a call in to the cops.

“The flasher was Voidberg?”

“Yeah.”

“Why was he—”

“I'll get to that,” said Moises, taking a drink of coffee.

“Let him tell the story, kid,” said one of the other cops, a thick-necked red-headed Irishman, who was barely chewing his donuts before swallowing them.

Moises Maloney continued:

So we get these calls and it's pretty clear someone has to go down there, but nobody wants to do it, so we draw straws and I get the short straw, so me and my partner at the time, Gustaffson (“Man, Gustaffson… rest his soul.”) get in our car and drive down there, but it's in the Dark itself, and it's a flasher, not a shooter, so we don't drive into the Dark but park outside and walk in.

Both of us are expecting the flasher's going to be long gone by now, because usually they get their jollies off and beat it, before one or other of the unassuming strangers they've exposed themselves to decides fuck that and beats their face in, and in this case there's parents involved, so forget about it, right? Well, wrong. Because even before we get there—and we're not walking very fast, mind you—we hear these short, wailing screams, just awful sounds. We think, what the fuck is going on? And it's not the same person screaming, so we know it's not the flasher getting beat. One scream, one voice, the next scream, another voice. And they're all so unfinished, like someone's taking an axe to these screams, hacking them in half before they've been fully expressed, and the unfinished half is shoving itself back down the screamer's throat, shutting them up. Never heard anything like it before.

The first person we see is this woman walking in the opposite direction from us, with two crying kids following her. They keep saying mom, mom, mom, but she's not even reacting, just walking like a fucking zombie. When she passes us I see her eyes: they're just *dead.* I say something to her—don't remember what—but I already know she's not gonna respond. She walks by us, the kids walk by us, and I look over at Gustaffson, who shrugs, but we draw our weapons because we don't know what the hell is going on.

That's how we come to the hill.

Central Dark's a big place and we're in this part where people like to hang out on the grass. There's the hill, which is usually pretty busy, and on the other side's a small playground, which is where the calls reported the flasher being. Today, the hill is empty. And we don't have to walk across it to get to the flasher—who, remember, we think is long gone—because he's right fucking there: on the top of the hill.

All around the hill's a group of people looking up at him, and he's pacing and turning round and round, dressed in a grey trench, like your stereotypical pervert.

It looks ridiculous, except they have real guns and they're trying to kill somebody. That's when one of them says it: ‘It's over, Voidberg. You're done. You're fucking done!’ For his part, Voidberg's not so much running away from them as running around them, keeping his distance but trying to face them at the same time. His hands are still on his trench, when one of the cops trips and falls and Voidberg—whose back is to us—stops, pulls open his trench like it's a pair of wings and he's a bird about to take off, off a cliff or something, and the cop, who's on his knees, trying to get up, falls over on his side and curls up into the fetal positon. ‘What in God's name?’ says Gustaffson.

I don't have time to answer, even if I could, because while Voidberg's standing there with his trench open, a gunshot rips into his shoulder. He screams, grabbing the place he's been hit, which is bleeding, the blood soaking into his trench. Gustaffson takes off up the hil. One of the other three cops gets to the one who's curled up while the other two run at Voidberg to finish him off. Maybe they would have done it too, if not for Gustaffson yelling *at them* to lay down their weapons. That little hesitation's all it takes. Voidberg gets moving again, but because he wants to run away from the pair of cops, he runs toward Gustaffson, and Gustaffson's holding his gun, pointing it—not at Voidberg but at the cops behind him—but Voidberg doesn't know that, and before I can follow Gustaffson up the hill, Voidberg opens his trench—

“Oh shit,” said the rookie.

“‘Oh shit's’ right,” said one of the other cops.

Another looked at his watch. “Time to go, boys. Break time's over.”

“What—no! What happened next?” asked the rookie, and Moises Maloney drank the rest of his coffee. “I need to know. Seriously.”

“Don't we all,” said the cop, the Irish one who'd just said, “‘Oh shit's’ right.”

“You mean none of you know?” asked the rookie.

“That's right. Long story, short break. Good old Maloney's never gotten past this part.”

Moises Maloney got up from the table they'd been sitting at. He started getting money out of his wallet.

“Damn,” said the rookie, getting up too.

“That's it?”

“What?”

“You wanna hear the end of the story but you're just gonna give up on it, just like that?”

“I thought you said break's over.”

“You thought it or I said it?” said the cop. The other cops, including Moises Maloney, were trying their hardest not to crack up.

“You… said it.”

“Well, I sure as shit didn't mean it. We're cops, kid. Wanna know who tells us when our breaks are over? We do. Nobody fucking else.”

Moises Maloney sat back down smiling. A waitress refilled his cup with coffee.

The rookie sat down too.

“We're just busting your balls, kid. Don't let yourself get pushed around, all right?”

“Sure,” said the rookie.

“So what happened next?” he asked.

Moises said:

Voidberg opened his trench right at Gustaffson. They were maybe twenty feet from each other. I was still down the hill, but I could see them. This time Voidberg wasn't facing away from me. I was at an angle but looking right at him, gun in my hand, and—

“What did you see?”

“Nothing,” said Moises Maloney.

“What do you mean, ‘Nothing?’” said the rookie.

“I don't mean I didn't see anything. I mean I saw nothing: a literal nothing. There was this emptiness in Voidberg's body, from his chest down to his crotch, but it wasn't a hole, you couldn't see through it to the other side. No, it was this deep, dark vacuum, and not in the Hoover sense, but in the sense of nothingness.”

“Fuck,” said the rookie. “*Void*berg.”

“I only saw it for a second—from a distance, an awkward angle, before I looked away, but even that was enough to shake me. I'll never forget it. I hope I never, ever see anything like it again. It hurt, you know? It hurt me *existentially* to see that fucking void.”

There was silence.

“What happened to Gustaffson?” asked the rookie.

“He went down. He went down and he never got up again, not really. It didn't kill him. It didn't kill anyone directly, but nobody was the same after. After it was all over, we got Gustaffson to the hopsital and he was alive, there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, but he wasn't the same. Same dead eyes as that woman we saw. Same as anybody who got flashed by Voidberg.

“When he got out of the hospital, they put on him meds, then used the meds to explain why he was different. He never got back on active duty. His girlfriend left him. Like, Christ, they'd been together ten years and she couldn't be with him after that, said she couldn't stand it. I asked her once if it was anything he did, like putting hands on her, and she said no, that it wasn’t about what he did, just the way he was. Nine months later he was dead. Clean, prescription drug overdose. No note. When I saw his body all I could think was, Fuck, the man doesn't look any different than when he was alive.”

“Sorry,” said the rookie.

“Yeah, well, me too. But the risk comes with the job—or the other way around.”

“I'll say what I've always said,” said the Irish cop: “I'll take a bullet to the head any day over something like that. That kind of erosion.”

“What happened to Voidberg?” asked the rookie.

“The two cops shot him in the back while he was flashing Gustaffson.”

“Died on the hill?”

“I don't know,” said Moises Maloney.

“You mean they didn't do an autopsy—or was it, like, inconclusive, or maybe you just didn't want to know?” asked the rookie.

“I mean that he was sure as fuck dying after they'd got him in the back. Fell over, moaning like an animal. But he was moving, breathing: wheezing. The two cops didn't want to get too close, and they'd stopped shooting. And then he kind of curled up himself, and pulled his head and shoulders *into the void in his body*, and when the upper part of him had disappeared into himself, he pulled the rest of himself into himself too and—*poof*—he was gone,” said Moises Maloney, snapping his fingers.

The rookie was staring at the black coffee in the white porcelain cup in front of him. Someone opened the cafe doors, they slammed shut and the surface of the coffee rippled because of the kinetic energy.

The rookie said, “You're busting my balls, right?”

“Yeah, kid. I'm busting your balls,” said Moises Maloney without a touch of sincerity.

He didn't see the rookie much after that, but one thing he noticed when he did is that the rookie never drank his coffee black. He always put milk in it—way too much milk, until the coffee was almost white.",1,1763672107.0,stories,1,1.0,False

*“You think humans are not to be feared or respected because they rely too much on allies? Have you ever wondered why they have those allies, or why humans have so many?*

*The Shraphen, almost born to be their best friends, were always a clear choice. But the Nuk? They are xenophobes like nearly no other species. The Trkik? A species that forgot what war even is. The Gliders, a hive-mind-like species that initially didn’t even use technology.*

*And still, they are bound to each other by their shared respect for one another and for humans.*

*That’s humanity’s superpower.*

*And they like to blow up solar systems. That too.”*

**Excerpt from:** ***The Aligned Worlds: The Enemy at Our Gates*****, Galactic Federation 23 P.I.**

 

 

The SIC was silent ever since the *Magellan* was towed back to the dockyards at Taishon Tar One. No, since the conference last week, the station had been renamed. It was now called Nirg Farar, “birthplace” in Shraphen.

Smith liked the analogy the Shraphen had chosen. The station really became a birthplace of an alliance.

He sipped his coffee slowly. The ship had been evacuated to the station, and only the engineers and dockworkers were around. He still felt he had to be on the ship as captain, and he wanted to observe the modifications being installed.

And after the conference led by Admiral Rolling, there were a lot of them.

The Nuk had actually demanded that Nuk shield generators be installed on the ship. To quote Yurdantho, their High Ordinator: “All Nuk in the fleet are oathbound to *Magellan’s* survival. As such, our honor demands installation of the best protection we know.”

And so a technology-sharing agreement between the Nuk diaspora fleet and the Aligned planets was signed.

That prompted Governor Raakor to demand that they be allowed to install their lightweight armor on the ship—a carbon-nanotube alloy the Shraphen had developed that no other species could replicate until now.

All of that made the dockmaster’s headache even worse, since his first comment after inspecting the ship was, “The frame’s bent, in some places even broken. Scrap it and build a new one—that’s quicker.”

An unacceptable solution for the Nuk and Captain Smith. But the ship still had to be almost completely disassembled and rebuilt—a three-month process, even with the support of the Nuk and Shraphen engineers.

And now the Admiral had a mission for the ship—well, for the crew, to be exact. Smith understood her reasoning. While the *Magellan* was being rebuilt, the scientists of the crew sat around twisting their thumbs…and making babies, in the case of the Gliders.

He almost spat out his coffee when he read the report. The initial Glider crew, when they left Earth, had been one hundred ten; it was now at three hundred two. They had to prepare accommodations at the station for that number of junglings.

He wasn’t trained for that.

Sitting down in the captain’s chair on the empty bridge, he made a call to the Admiral. The bridge still smelled like burned plastic. The last laser lance at the Battle of the Rim, as it was called now, had really broken the ship—straight through the hull and into the reactor.

He remembered, with a smile, the triumphant feeling when the navigator managed to line up one last shot. Later, the engineers even brought the fusion core back. But by then, the battle was over.

“Captain, I appreciate the theatrics of you sitting in your chair, but it isn’t necessary. I haven’t forgotten your ship is… in slight need of a new paint job, as Chief Stiller put it.” The Admiral appeared on the cracked main viewscreen.

“Sorry, Admiral, it’s no theatrics. I visit my ship every day, and your staff reached me while I was here. We have a new mission?” He tried to relax in his chair, but parts of it were molten, so he gave up the attempt.

“Two missions, Captain. One long-term, one hopefully solved quickly.”

“Oh, so two missions that both don’t need a ship? Sounds interesting.” Captain Smith wasn’t sure what to make of it. Especially the long-term part—it sounded more like losing personnel permanently. He didn’t like the thought of that.

“First, I need teams to analyze what our surveyors found on Atlantis.”

Smith frowned. “Admiral?”

The Admiral smiled. “That’s what the ice moon around Taishon Rog is now named.”

“The megastructure? Isn’t it at the core of the moon the size of Europa? One thousand three hundred kilometers under water.”

“Yes, but I’m certain your scientists and engineers will figure out a way.” The words were more of an order than a suggestion.

“Well, they can’t say they don’t get any challenges.” He seriously doubted the scientists would find anything.

“And the second mission is to Marjan’s Star. As you know, we receive message torpedoes from our people on the other side, but ours keep being spat out as soon as they enter the anomaly.”

Smith wasn’t surprised by this; he’d been waiting for the order and already had a team in mind.

—————

The small ship was unexpectedly roomy; Sokra even had a small cabin, as did the other members of the team aboard the *Stefan Karl*. It was a tiny ship compared to a cruiser, but still three times as large as a Sleipnir-class transporter.

Lieutenant Kendersson, their pilot on this mission, had explained to her that the class was called the Fafnir class—a medium-range transporter.

They were again on their way to Marjan’s Star to solve more mysteries.

The team comprised the Glider ShutUpBitch, Doctor Vauben, and herself. Lieutenant Kendersson was their pilot, as he had the most experience with the anomaly.

Additionally, they had five high-capability sensor drones aboard, since the *Stefan Karl* had a very poor sensor suite.

The drones were controlled by Ferdinand, whose VI core used up the space of a cabin. Since the *Magellan* was being rebuilt, he had no other duties anyway, and ShutUpBitch said a VI could be useful.

The ship's living room was also the mission's control room, and Sokra was studying the data while eating. Next to her was ShutUpBitch, chewing on some grapes.

*'And anything interesting in the reports?'* Since her babies were back at Nirg Farar Station, she was more relaxed.

“No. Just that the torpedoes from the Trkik systems reach us without issues, but every torpedo we send in gets spat out as soon as it crosses the anomaly.”

*'The shield frequency is the same?'*

“Yes.”

*'That is odd. What does Doctor Vauben say about it?'*

Now Sokra glared angrily at the Glider. “He’s still drunk in his cabin. How much did you two have last night?”

The small Glider stared back, unimpressed. *'I was six weeks sober, and it’s not my fault a seventy-kilogram human can’t drink more than a five-kilogram Glider.'*

“You metabolize alcohol like any sugar and need five times the amount a human does to even get drunk!”

*'Vauben didn’t know that.'*

“Obviously!” Sokra was not really angry at ShutUpBitch; she found it rather funny, but she had learned that Gliders knew no bounds in their behavior if you didn’t set rules. Their whole people had severe PTSD, as human doctors called it.

*'Anyway, I still think the EM shields have something to do with it.'*

“Then why can the torpedoes pass from the other side? The engineers even tried the A-Drive bubble trick they used to stabilize the non-space inside the anomaly—to no effect.”

*'Of course not.'* The Glider did not explain further, and Sokra knew better than to ask.

“You said the realspace we introduced last time is like a tunnel between the two exits, right?” An idea formed. Maybe space inside the anomaly was folded in a way that anything entering it would leave at Marjan’s Star.

*'Yes and no. I know what you think. It’s a brilliant thought, but it’s not it.'*

Sokra was almost done with the half-answers from the Glider. Even if ShutUpBitch were a specialist in multidimensional spaces, she still needed to explain her thoughts or shut up.

“Why? Or am I too stupid to understand?”

*'No, but I’m glad you asked. We initially thought the rift leads to a pocket dimension or a lower-state dimension of our universe. I’m not so sure anymore about it.'* The Glider grabbed another grape and started chewing with her mouth open and one eye closed.

*'It’s too uniform. I made some calculations after we were back. If it was what I would call pointspace, we would not travel through it as we did. We would have been expelled, since we do not… fit in it.'*

Sokra began to believe she was indeed too stupid to understand. “Pointspace?”

*'Oh boy, how to explain it… Imagine our reality—our dimension—is the top layer of a ball, and below us are other layers. One layer deeper, we have… let’s call it line space. There, the universe has only two dimensions. A layer deeper, there’s only one dimension, and everything is at the same point.'* Another grape was devoured by the Glider, and Sokra raised her ears in astonishment at how much a Glider could eat.

*'Can you imagine that?'*

“Yes.” Sokra now thought she understood.

*'Good, because that’s not how it works, but it’s an approximation a three-dimensional brain can understand.'*

“Oh, okay… and the anomaly is not like that?” Sokra’s brain hurt now. She obviously knew of the M-stack theory—it was the basis of virtual particle theory—but she had never gone into the geometry of those other dimensions.

*'No. Line space and pointspace both would have ejected us as soon as we entered. Without EM shields, we would have ended up as a spike of virtual particles somewhere. Here, we were thrown out of transit by an object inside the anomaly that even had mass. That’s not possible in lower dimensions—not in that way, at least.'*

The Glider had now started to walk up and down the table, a clear sign she was thinking about a serious problem—and a sign she was nervous.

*'This was different.'*

Sokra knew what the answer would be, even feared it, but she had to ask anyway.

“Different how?”

*'It seemed built. Constructed. Artificial somehow.'*

Sokra remembered the uniform particle patterns inside the non-space where the *Magellan* had been captured in their own Möbius space. Thinking back, ShutUpBitch’s answer seemed logical. Logical… and frightening.

“Someone can build their own dimension?”

*'Sure. Give me half a galaxy of exotic matter, the energy of three or four supermassive black holes, and, I don’t know, a million years of development, and we’re fine. Sokra, if I’m right—and I surely hope I’m not—we stumbled upon an artifact so far beyond our understanding it’s laughable.'*

Sokra’s tail was now tucked firmly between her legs; the thought of an entry into something so far over their heads, right next to her home, chilling her. She now understood what Captain Smith once said to her.

“Don’t wake any cosmic horrors.”

YA spy-thriller: NYC girl’s diplomat dad disappears — Israel attack, hacker boyfriend, love-drug bunker, South America killing, yacht assassination attempt

Body:
I’m trying to identify a YA/young adult hardcover novel I read in 2025 (English). The main character was around 17–18 (a high school senior). The plot was very spy/espionage-thriller.

What I remember:
	•	A teen girl lives in New York City.
	•	She buys her dad a fountain pen for his birthday. He’s drunk, they fight, and he disappears the next day.
	•	Neighbors reveal he was secretly a diplomat / covert operative, explaining their frequent moves.
	•	She discovers a storage locker full of secret items about her mom and dad.

⸻

Beginning of the book:
	•	She is in Israel training with a mysterious martial-arts teacher who refuses to give her name.
	•	They are shot at and almost kidnapped by two men.
	•	She and the teacher escape but then get separated, and the teacher disappears.

⸻

The love interest (NYC hacker):
	•	Her love interest is a rich NYC hacker teen whose father is emotionally absent.
	•	He offers to go with her; she refuses at first, so he helps her by hacking government systems from home.
	•	Later he joins her abroad, and they develop a romance.

⸻

The bunker sequence:
	•	She gets tricked by a woman and taken to an underground bunker.
	•	The woman drugs her with a chemical that is supposed to mimic love (a “love-drug”).
	•	She escapes with help from a different guy (NOT the hacker boyfriend).

⸻

South America plot (important detail):
	•	While in South America, she and her hacker boyfriend get caught in a violent confrontation.
	•	A man ends up killed right in front of them, and afterwards they must saw down the body in a tub to dispose of it.
	•	Her hacker boyfriend is horrified and disgusted, considers leaving, but ends up staying because he loves her and wants to help her.

⸻

Possible book 2 (or later in the same book):
	•	She meets a woman related to someone from the past.
	•	They go on a yacht; the woman tries to kill her.
	•	She jumps off the boat into the water and swims to a marina with restaurants/cafés.
	•	Later, they talk over coffee and agree they won’t be friends but won’t be enemies either.

⸻

Other details:
	•	She travels internationally (Israel, South America, possibly more).
	•	There are strong themes of espionage, hidden family past, conspiracies, romance, and survival.

Does this ring a bell for anyone?

I have no family and haven’t for a long time and felt like I was ok with that. Father got a replacement family and bailed when I was young, his entire side of the family despises me and refers to me as “it” because I’m a trans man, mothers side fractured and fell away after I disclosed abuse as a child. My mother is a raging narcissist and after I finally cut her off, she emailed me a few weeks ago to tell me I’ll burn in hell and she has hated me for years. 

I have no friends and it’s not for lack of desire. I thought I had good friends at one point and then I started to realize they only invited me over to hang out if something needed to be repaired because I’m good at that. After a close evaluation of my life I’ve come to realize that all of my friendships, dating back to childhood, have been transactional like that. I’m genuinely kind even if there’s nothing to be gained, I’m trustworthy, I’d give any friend the shirt off my back if they needed it. I’ve sat here for days trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. There has to be something I’m not seeing for me to have no value to other people. 

I had a girlfriend up until recently. We had been together for a year and a half and I seriously thought she was the one. I became unemployed and she changed. The affection stopped, she spoke to me differently, and essentially told me I’m not good to anyone if I’m not financially stable. She said I need to focus on finding another job and can’t focus on a relationship at the same time. She needed us to have our own space and asked me to leave, so I did. I was already lonely and now I’m unemployed, and homeless on top of that. 
I feel like I’m existing outside of the world. I’m obviously here, but I’m invisible and only able to watch life happen for other people. I wish I had someone to call and talk to. I wish I had people to greet me with open arms. I wish I had a champion to push and encourage me when things get hard. I wish that instead of huddling up under a park awning to escape the rain that I was in a warm coffee shop laughing and sharing stories with people who care about me. Or maybe running errands, on the phone, trying to decide what I’ll make us for dinner tonight. I thought I’d be fantasizing about being out of the cold, but I just dream of connection and being seen by someone. Anyone. I feel like I have to justify my existence, or sometimes apologize for it.

I have owned Keurig coffee machines for YEARS and decided to finally switch to something different.  I read really good things about the Moccamaster KBT and decided to pull the trigger. 

However, I've heard that it does take more effort to brew a good pot of coffee because you have to stir the grinds around in the filter as it brews. Is this true? It makes sense.   So now I'm wondering if these are really worth the premium price tag or if I should go with a different option.  

Overall, I just want a really great cup of coffee!  I don't mind doing a little bit of work to make it happen.

(18F)

Making friends has been hell. I’ve only been in college for 4 months so I’m trying to be patient. 

I put myself out there, I ask people if they want to get coffee sometime, or go to a movie, or come back to apartment for a study session, etc. I don’t say “wanna hangout!”. 

I’ve noticed a common theme with people that have boyfriends. They don’t put much effort into friendships. I steer away from these connections. 

Every time I hang out with someone and it’s going well, I always state what I’m looking for in a friendship (NOT something low maintenance). Every. Single. Person. Doesn’t put in any effort. Should I not state this? Am I trying too hard? 

For example, one time I reached out to someone from my class and we got coffee. I had an amazing time and she did too. We spent hours together talking about our life. We planned a study session at the end of our hangout at my house. I wrote down a date and time. She ignored me and never showed up. 

I know that people are busy, but is it ALWAYS going to be like this? Am I being overbearing with what I need? 

I don’t like surface level friendships. I tried Bumble BFF and there was nothing. Do I just need to give it a few years and meet people in my early twenties and hopefully the friendship pool will be better? I feel like a lot of it is just immaturity/avoidance from the people I feel like I connect with. ",1,1763671270.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,5,1.0,False

1p2efra,https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1p2efra/nonfiction_historyfoodscienceculture_without/,Nonfiction history/food/science/culture (without frying my brain),"I read exclusively nonfiction these days (easier to pick up and put down with young kids). I tend towards history, food, science. But also, I’m not a specialist in any of these, so striking the balance of ‘I learn something new’ but also still ‘Readable / approachable’ rather than a text book.

A few of the books I love:
* Endangered eating by Sarah Lohman (and her other works);
* The Golden Thread, How Fabric Changed History by Kassia St Clair (and her other works);
* River of the Gods: Genius, Courage, and Betrayal in the Search for the Source of the Nile by Candice Millard;
* The Fabric of civilisation, how textiles changed the world by Virginia Postrel (not that I’m particularly keen on fabric per se, but I learnt entirely new perspectives from this);
* Erebus: the story of a ship by Michael Palin;
* First Bite: How we learn to eat by Bee Wilson; 
* The Secret life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot;
* The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean (and his other works);
* At Home by Bill Bryson (and his non-travel works);
* Bonk by Mary Roach (and most of her other works)
* The Taste of Conquest by Michael Krondl;
* For All the Tea in China by Sarah Rose;
* Invitation to a Banquet by Fuschia Dunlop;
* Kingdom of Characters by Jing Tsu;
* Butter by Elaine Khosrova;
* Catching Fire, How Cooking Made Us Human by Richard Wrangham;
* The Dawn of the Deed by John A Long
* Without You There Is No Us by Suyi Kim

Things already on my reading list:
* Indigo, in search of the color that seduces the world;
* Swindled, the dark history of food fraud, from poisoned candy to counterfeit coffee;
* Curry, a global history;
* Skin, a natural history;
* From secret ballot to democracy sausage - how Australia got compulsory voting;
* Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds & Shape Our Futures by Merlin Sheldrake;

I’m generally not interested in: military history (except ‘Operation Mincemeat’ was great); swathes of American history; memoirs or biographies of individuals; nonfiction books that are going to leave me depressed / angry (or depressed while reading it). I don’t mind some politics / economics but that’s the core of my job so it often feels more like work than something I’d read for fun. I like learning new cultural history.

What can I even do here?,"So, she came round my house last week Friday, previous to which I cleaned everything, made sure I had anything she wanted in he fridge, ingredients to cook nice meals for her and plans to spend a day shopping where she could help me buy clothes and a nice Thai meal in the evening.

So Friday comes around, I cook a beautiful chickpea and lentil curry which she loves, after which we start chilling on the sofa and put a movie on.

Shortly after the movie has started, she starts taking all of the thighs that I normally have on my coffee table and moving them all elsewhere, I ask her not to do that to which her reply was 'you can move it all back there when I'm gone', which, frustrated, I replied ""I will."" She sat in silence through the movie, pushed my hand away from hers when I tried to hold it, when I asked if she was annoyed with me, she said she was hurt, I asked what she was hurt about, to which she replied ""Everything."" and refused to say anymore, didn't want to talk at all. When the movie was finished, I tried to get her to open up, talk to me and apologized for probably overreacting to her moving my things. She said nothing, said she wants to be alone and will be sleeping on the sofa and leaving in the morning, which all happened.

Said nothing for the rest of the day after leaving, didn't reply to my messages until the next day, where I just said I wanted to understand what's going on with her, which she then exploded in to:
The weekend that she was looking forward to was ruined
The coffee table was gross and unwelcoming
Me replying 'I will' was disgusting 
That I'm not putting effort in and my hospitality is 'selective'
and that I gave her so much shit that she didn't deserve.

I apologised again for the tone of the I will and forgetting to clean the coffee table (there was a bit of dust on there), but also said that the suggestion that I'm not putting effort is actually kind of hurtful, the reply being 'you can find it however you want'. 

Forward to tonight, she's replying to messages some times, but mostly single words and leaving me on read.

1p2eerl,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1p2eerl/voidberg/,Voidberg,"Moises Maloney sat mid-afternoon in a cafe with several other cops, one of whom was a rookie. They were eating donuts and drinking coffee. One of the other cops said to Moises, “Hey, Maloney, why don't you tell the kid about Voidberg,” then asked the rookie, “Kid, you heard about Voidberg?” The rookie said, “No, I never heard about Voidberg. What's Voidberg?” and he looked at Moises Maloney, who finished chewing a chunk of his Baston Cream donut and said:

Once upon a time when I was just a little past being a rookie myself, I got a call to go out to Central Dark to deal with a pervert, *a flasher,* you know, one of those weirdos who runs around in a trenchcoat with nothing underneath exposing himself to strangers. In this case it was multiple calls that had come in. The guy was apparently exposing himself to children, upset one of them, who ran to his parents, who put a call in to the cops.

“The flasher was Voidberg?”

“Yeah.”

“Why was he—”

“I'll get to that,” said Moises, taking a drink of coffee.

“Let him tell the story, kid,” said one of the other cops, a thick-necked red-headed Irishman, who was barely chewing his donuts before swallowing them.

Moises Maloney continued:

So we get these calls and it's pretty clear someone has to go down there, but nobody wants to do it, so we draw straws and I get the short straw, so me and my partner at the time, Gustaffson (“Man, Gustaffson… rest his soul.”) get in our car and drive down there, but it's in the Dark itself, and it's a flasher, not a shooter, so we don't drive into the Dark but park outside and walk in.

Both of us are expecting the flasher's going to be long gone by now, because usually they get their jollies off and beat it, before one or other of the unassuming strangers they've exposed themselves to decides fuck that and beats their face in, and in this case there's parents involved, so forget about it, right? Well, wrong. Because even before we get there—and we're not walking very fast, mind you—we hear these short, wailing screams, just awful sounds. We think, what the fuck is going on? And it's not the same person screaming, so we know it's not the flasher getting beat. One scream, one voice, the next scream, another voice. And they're all so unfinished, like someone's taking an axe to these screams, hacking them in half before they've been fully expressed, and the unfinished half is shoving itself back down the screamer's throat, shutting them up. Never heard anything like it before.

The first person we see is this woman walking in the opposite direction from us, with two crying kids following her. They keep saying mom, mom, mom, but she's not even reacting, just walking like a fucking zombie. When she passes us I see her eyes: they're just *dead.* I say something to her—don't remember what—but I already know she's not gonna respond. She walks by us, the kids walk by us, and I look over at Gustaffson, who shrugs, but we draw our weapons because we don't know what the hell is going on.

That's how we come to the hill.

Central Dark's a big place and we're in this part where people like to hang out on the grass. There's the hill, which is usually pretty busy, and on the other side's a small playground, which is where the calls reported the flasher being. Today, the hill is empty. And we don't have to walk across it to get to the flasher—who, remember, we think is long gone—because he's right fucking there: on the top of the hill.

All around the hill's a group of people looking up at him, and he's pacing and turning round and round, dressed in a grey trench, like your stereotypical pervert. Some of the crowd's turned away, so they have their backs to him. Others are covering their kids eyes. The kids are crying. There are maybe six or seven adults walking like zombies, like the woman who passed us. And every once in a while somebody runs up the hill to get to the flasher, and he flashes them and they just stop, drop and curl up. Fetal position, like whatever they've seen's pushed them back through time and they're as helpless as infants.

Gustaffson shouts, ‘Police!’

Most of the people surrounding the hill look over at us, and we're not sure what to do. The flasher doesn't acknowledge us, but he's not armed, so I don't want to run up the hill pointing my gun at him, because that's gonna be a world of paperwork, so I say, ‘Hey, buddy—you up on the hill there. My name's Moises Maloney and me and my partner here are with the NZPD. You wanna come down off that hill and talk to us?’ He doesn't answer but starts laughing, and not in a happy way but like he's being forced to laugh, you know? Like he's a hyena and it's his nature to make a sound that sounds like laughter but really isn't laughter. If anything, he looks and sounds lost, confused, cornered He's not attacking anyone or even aggressively flashing them or anything. It's more defensive. Somebody runs up the hill, he flashes them to keep them away. Keep in mind he's surrounded too. He can't get off the hill. Anyway, I'm thinking he's a mental case, which jibes with him flashing random strangers in the Dark.

‘We're not here to hurt you,’ Gustaffson yells to him, and he means it. Gustaffson was a stand-up guy. For a second it seems the flasher's thinking of coming down to us. The crowd's gone silent. He's at least stopped spinning round, so now he's just standing there with his hands on his trench, making sure it stays closed.

Then we hear a gunshot—and all hell breaks loose—people strat screaming, scattering, no idea whee the shot came from, until four cops come running in from the other side of the Dark. Gustaffson looks at me. I look at the cops. NZPD unfiorms, but I’ve never seen any of them before. We try to get their attention, but they don't care about anything except the flasher, who's gone bug-eyed and is spinning again on the top of the hill, and I think, well, fuck, there goes our chance of talking him down. Not that I think it for long, because these other cops, they run through the crowd and start firing at the flasher. No warning, no hesitation, just ***bang bang bang.***

That puts the flasher into a real frenzy, and rightly so because he's getting fucking shot at.

Gustaffson strats yelling, ‘He's unarmed! He's unarmed!’ as I get over to the closest of the four cops, who tells me, ‘He doesn't have a gun but he's dangerous!’ and ‘Come on, help us nail this freak!’

But I'm not about to shoot an unarmed mental case, and I'm already imagining what I'll say in my defense, but also, as far as I know, these other cops don't have any authority over us, and Gustaffson's not shooting.

The cop who was talking to me shakes his head and runs after the other three cops, who are now chasing the flasher, taking shots, missing. It's a goddamn farce. It looks ridiculous, except they have real guns and they're trying to kill somebody. That's when one of them says it: ‘It's over, Voidberg. You're done. You're fucking done!’ For his part, Voidberg's not so much running away from them as running around them, keeping his distance but trying to face them at the same time. His hands are still on his trench, when one of the cops trips and falls and Voidberg—whose back is to us—stops, pulls open his trench like it's a pair of wings and he's a bird about to take off, off a cliff or something, and the cop, who's on his knees, trying to get up, falls over on his side and curls up into the fetal positon. ‘What in God's name?’ says Gustaffson.

I don't have time to answer, even if I could, because while Voidberg's standing there with his trench open, a gunshot rips into his shoulder. He screams, grabbing the place he's been hit, which is bleeding, the blood soaking into his trench. Gustaffson takes off up the hil. One of the other three cops gets to the one who's curled up while the other two run at Voidberg to finish him off. Maybe they would have done it too, if not for Gustaffson yelling *at them* to lay down their weapons. That little hesitation's all it takes. Voidberg gets moving again, but because he wants to run away from the pair of cops, he runs toward Gustaffson, and Gustaffson's holding his gun, pointing it—not at Voidberg but at the cops behind him—but Voidberg doesn't know that, and before I can follow Gustaffson up the hill, Voidberg opens his trench—

“Oh shit,” said the rookie.

“‘Oh shit's’ right,” said one of the other cops.

Another looked at his watch. “Time to go, boys. Break time's over.”

“What—no! What happened next?” asked the rookie, and Moises Maloney drank the rest of his coffee. “I need to know. Seriously.”

“Don't we all,” said the cop, the Irish one who'd just said, “‘Oh shit's’ right.”

“You mean none of you know?” asked the rookie.

“That's right. Long story, short break. Good old Maloney's never gotten past this part.”

Moises Maloney got up from the table they'd been sitting at. He started getting money out of his wallet.

“Damn,” said the rookie, getting up too.

“That's it?”

“What?”

“You wanna hear the end of the story but you're just gonna give up on it, just like that?”

“I thought you said break's over.”

“You thought it or I said it?” said the cop. The other cops, including Moises Maloney, were trying their hardest not to crack up.

“You… said it.”

“Well, I sure as shit didn't mean it. We're cops, kid. Wanna know who tells us when our breaks are over? We do. Nobody fucking else.”

Moises Maloney sat back down smiling. A waitress refilled his cup with coffee.

The rookie sat down too.

“We're just busting your balls, kid. Don't let yourself get pushed around, all right?”

“Sure,” said the rookie.

“So what happened next?” he asked.

Moises said:

Voidberg opened his trench right at Gustaffson. They were maybe twenty feet from each other. I was still down the hill, but I could see them. This time Voidberg wasn't facing away from me. I was at an angle but looking right at him, gun in my hand, and—

“What did you see?”

“Nothing,” said Moises Maloney.

“What do you mean, ‘Nothing?’” said the rookie.

“I don't mean I didn't see anything. I mean I saw nothing: a literal nothing. There was this emptiness in Voidberg's body, from his chest down to his crotch, but it wasn't a hole, you couldn't see through it to the other side. No, it was this deep, dark vacuum, and not in the Hoover sense, but in the sense of nothingness.”

“Fuck,” said the rookie. “*Void*berg.”

“I only saw it for a second—from a distance, an awkward angle, before I looked away, but even that was enough to shake me. I'll never forget it. I hope I never, ever see anything like it again. It hurt, you know? It hurt me *existentially* to see that fucking void.”

There was silence.

“What happened to Gustaffson?” asked the rookie.

“He went down. He went down and he never got up again, not really. It didn't kill him. It didn't kill anyone directly, but nobody was the same after. After it was all over, we got Gustaffson to the hopsital and he was alive, there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, but he wasn't the same. Same dead eyes as that woman we saw. Same as anybody who got flashed by Voidberg.

“When he got out of the hospital, they put on him meds, then used the meds to explain why he was different. He never got back on active duty. His girlfriend left him. Like, Christ, they'd been together ten years and she couldn't be with him after that, said she couldn't stand it. I asked her once if it was anything he did, like putting hands on her, and she said no, that it wasn’t about what he did, just the way he was. Nine months later he was dead. Clean, prescription drug overdose. No note. When I saw his body all I could think was, Fuck, the man doesn't look any different than when he was alive.”

“Sorry,” said the rookie.

“Yeah, well, me too. But the risk comes with the job—or the other way around.”

“I'll say what I've always said,” said the Irish cop: “I'll take a bullet to the head any day over something like that. That kind of erosion.”

“What happened to Voidberg?” asked the rookie.

“The two cops shot him in the back while he was flashing Gustaffson.”

“Died on the hill?”

“I don't know,” said Moises Maloney.

“You mean they didn't do an autopsy—or was it, like, inconclusive, or maybe you just didn't want to know?” asked the rookie.

“I mean that he was sure as fuck dying after they'd got him in the back. Fell over, moaning like an animal. But he was moving, breathing: wheezing. The two cops didn't want to get too close, and they'd stopped shooting. And then he kind of curled up himself, and pulled his head and shoulders *into the void in his body*, and when the upper part of him had disappeared into himself, he pulled the rest of himself into himself too and—*poof*—he was gone,” said Moises Maloney, snapping his fingers.

The rookie was staring at the black coffee in the white porcelain cup in front of him. Someone opened the cafe doors, they slammed shut and the surface of the coffee rippled because of the kinetic energy.

The rookie said, “You're busting my balls, right?”

“Yeah, kid. I'm busting your balls,” said Moises Maloney without a touch of sincerity.

He didn't see the rookie much after that, but one thing he noticed when he did is that the rookie never drank his coffee black. He always put milk in it—way too much milk, until the coffee was almost white.",3,1763671168.0,normancrane,1,1.0,False

My dog Leo isn’t just “high-energy”—he’s a 70-pound demolition crew with a PhD in Creative Destruction. “Indestructible” toys? He turns them into confetti in five minutes flat. Then he gets bored and redesigns my furniture with his teeth.

But this toy? Jesus Christ.

He threw it so hard it left a mark on the drywall. He power-bombed it into the baseboards. He drop-kicked it across the hardwood like a soccer ball. I stopped counting the impacts after twenty, flinching each time, waiting for the inevitable plastic explosion.

Perfectly intact. Not even a dent.

That inner piece moves like it’s taunting him—constantly shifting, never predictable. It’s turned my meathead puppy into a furry little engineer, obsessed with cracking the code. He’ll spend an hour straight methodically working it, panting, completely locked in, forgetting the world exists.

The result? My couch cushions are unmolested. My shoes are whole. My baseboards are clean. Leo is sprawled out, actually exhausted from using his brain instead of just his body. I drank my coffee while it was hot. *Hot.*

Whoever you are: you didn’t recommend a toy. You gave me back my security deposit and my sanity.

1p2e9kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1p2e9kp/my_experience_in_us_residency_training/,My experience in US residency training,"I have had many questions and DMs about my experience in the US so I wanted to put a quick low down of the situation here and my own experiences so far. I am going to give context as this is important depending on who is considering the states especially now with the new administration. I am a UK born person of Indian origin and have lived in the UK my entire life. My views are skewed as I am fortunate to have a US greencard so did not have to deal with visas, but many of my friends/collegaues are on visas. I am now reaching the end of IM residency training in a blue state that is very multicultural and safe. I quit during IMT1 before making the move across.

Training program - Way way better in all respects. We have 5 hours of scheduled didactics and teaching every week, that is uninterrupted and we are off any call duties during this time. The hours are brutal - typical shifts will be from 6am to 4pm and often 12 hour days say 6am to 6pm 6 days a week on the heaviest rotations such as ICU or night shifts. There is no getting around these hours, but the intensity is FAR FAR less than any typical NHS shift. The job is just 'cleaner', when I order a test it gets done within minutes, no vetting/begging with radiology. Labs are done by nurses and phlebotomy is 24/7. I have never done an ABG or IV lines here, this is all done by nurses. The attendings (consultants) are actually invested in your training and development, I was never asked anything about this in the NHS. Quality of training is excellent.

Pay - Per hour probably less than a Macdonalds worker. But oddly I feel 'richer'. My effective take home is more than it was in the UK, with fewer tax and excellent health insurance. I can see specialists within days and any tests I need are done very fast; I have had access to medications the NHS would not cover before other alternatives have been tried. I get lunch 3-4x per week during teaching, tea and coffee free all over the hospital and I get a very generous meal allowance on top. I get a free laptop, free parking in a staff accessed car park, free white coats that have my name on them with free dry cleaning as many times as I need. Conferences are fully funded incl. travel, food and hotels. Everything is in place to help me do my job effectively.

Attending salaries - I am getting offers for $300k + bonus with sign on bonus ranging from 25-30k on top. The more patients you see, the more you bill and the more money you make. Annual leave is less than the UK but you do 7 on 7 off, with your on weeks you start early say 7am - 3pm if you're efficient with notes/billing and are expected to be available after 3pm - 7pm for any concerns from PAs. 

Cost of living/life - The nicest parts of the US are very expensive to buy a home; housing is similar maybe a bit less than London. Overall, id say cost of living is about 10-20% more but the salary is double so it more than makes up for it. Housing is newer, much more modern and spacious than UK housing. Food quality isn't the best, if you want UK quality expect to pay a premium for it.

Politics - The country is going through a very dark period at the moment, the hope is Trump will lose power in the mid terms and that the country can weather this storm, although I personally have not been affected by the situation at all. I can see how many would be discouraged by the political situation; living in a strongly blue state I have had very little if any issues. I have never seen a gun since arriving here, I feel much safer than I did in the UK (although I lived in a bad part of England when I did live there). Police are friendly which I never thought I would say, all my interactions with Americans have been very pleasant. I have had less racism here than I did in England, although time will tell.

Culture - This is the most frustrating part of being here. There is a hustle culture and no concept of work-life balance. The country is a corporation and everything is about extracting $$$ from patients and insurance companies. Although the quality of care for the privileged few is amazing and I hardly deal with insurance, you really have to ignore the systemic issues with the healthcare system. Although the country has welcomed me with open arms and I am very happy with the future prospects I have here. When I tell people I am a doctor, they are genuinely in awe. Public respect and prestige are another level than the UK. I have had patients thank me for my service on a daily basis and they LOVE the British accent here, it gets you much much further in both professional and personal interactions. They have immense respect for the UK in general and UK medical degrees.

Visas - Many of my colleagues are on the J1 visas, they have had no issues at all leaving or entering the country as physicians are highly valued and respected professionals.

Overall - It is far from perfect here, at times you feel like you are trading one set of issues for another but overall I feel much much better about the future here. I am paid very well, highly respected and have a bright financial future to look forward to with the ability to live in a nice affluent area in a house I couldn't dream of buying in the UK; unfortunately that comes at the cost of having to live in a bit of a bubble and ignoring the many systemic issues the US has, which many may not be able to stomach.

1p2e9cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1p2e9cv/the_hollowoaks_among_eggs_and_daggers_light/,"The Hollow-Oaks: Among Eggs and Daggers (Light fantasy, 1280)","A lazy first light crept up the hills. On this foreboding rise, the only birds heard singing were his brothers-in-arms, their chorus sullen and quarrelsome. Twenty-two in counting in all, half still asleep, leaving a handful of them to decide their battalion’s fate. Unlike Parliament, their members never held enfranchisement as an unwavering right. Where faces failed to appear at the entrance or through the broken window behind the abandoned pub, Hamish made careful note of their absence. Tough times were upon them. *Every face that looks at me scowls.* The realization twisted the tension in his belly tighter. *No smiles or laughs for their faithful commander.* Even their gazes were like staring into a hungry mob, his head carried on a spear reflected in the whites of their eyes. *Anyone watching might mistake this for an opening move of a coup d'état.* As the one-handed clock struck nine, his brothers glanced at their stools, then at each other, trying to silently agree whether they’d sit with him or stand against him. 

Waving away a dusty cobweb tangled between the wooden legs, Beolin-the-Dog sat down. The Serpent's Eggs' third in command was never one to disappoint. He snarled and cursed, his cheeks dusted with their own dark webs of reluctant facial fluff. A grisly mop of auburn clung to a side, covering scars and old wounds. Held back four years in his education and now expelled, Beolin had once served another Hollow-Oak at a much lower rank before. He still squandered away in the filth of his grandmother’s attic floor. ‘The fortune teller’s den,’ he’d boastfully refer to it as. Though the dog was loyal to the teeth. *If any still remain*, Hamish could only wish there was truth to that. It was difficult to count them by smiles alone.

One by one, the rest fell into their stools. After the dark mummers passed them by, their cheeks dry from spitting on the planks of their meeting room, their swears fading as more strained to listen to what their commander called them here so early in the day. *And worse, on a Saturday.* The Dog banged his foot against the floor until the stragglers heeded to listen. They were lucky Hamish was content with a little disobedience. ‘Good.’ He never dared to meet their daggered frowns until the last of his words were spoken. ‘I give my thanks to those who’ve made their way here. I understand a lot here would rather be at bacon and eggs than chewing words with the likes of me. This wasn’t how I wanted to spend these hours either, I swear on that at least…’ *If I meet their eyes I will be eaten alive.* ‘...Yet it has come to my attention that even among those who’ve come, most of you are not pleased with how this adventure has been going. And I can say that is rightfully so. This coffee we’ve all drunk from has turned bitter. I dare admit not enough spoonfuls of honey would convince anyone here to willingly take another sip. Heed my advice and you shall all be merrily gulping down this new beverage from my own mug.’

*Yuri The Runny Yolk* spat yellowish ooze from the back of his throat. It missed Hamish’s shoe by an inch landing on the rug beneath his feet instead. *An answer appropriate for an egg.* The boy’s rheumy eyes were stained a similar colour to the glob. ‘Shove that spoon up your arse, commander.’ Though younger than his years suggested, the noisy lad shared Hamish’s blondness - his sleek instead of curled, and dusted with pepper on top. ‘After I’ve heated the rim with a lighter, of course.’ *That wouldn’t be the first time you’ve done that with a spoon,* Hamish thought, though he figured it was in his interest to keep that comment to himself.

*Tom-Tickle-Me-Silly* hadn’t the slightest laugh on his lips for once. Thankfully, he did not spit. Fourth in command, last to be chosen, the fool’s jests were as cynical as they were amusing when he’d first been chosen for the role. ‘This is no time for quips, Egg.’ A chain of keys jingled in place of bells by his loose bottom pockets, one leg purple, the other green, with his upper garments appropriately matching. Many moons ago, Tom’s face was painted split for every occasion. Not anymore. Definitely not for this. Though Hamish never once recalled seeing him wear a motley three-pointed cap ‘n bells.

‘Indeed there’s not,’ replied the egg. The rheumy lad turned to face the brooding crowd that thought it best to listen rather than shout and curse over each other for a change. *Perhaps they’re too tired to protest,* Hamish realized as he eyed them. *Or a lot of them have already given up.*  But it was clear Yuri felt he had no choice but to speak his mind. ‘No point in meetings, nor discussions or plans, or drinking from another of our commanders’ poisoned cups. Am I the only sound mind here who sees this? A *doomed* adventure this is. That should’ve never begun. No longer can I save up for my future when the piggy bank has been smashed by our foes and the rest of it spent on whatever remains here. There’s no fucking time for the Serpent Eggs, and that’s coming from an egg!’ Again Yuri spat. This time he succeeded in wetting a shoelace, his own. 

A chant erupted from those who saw wisdom in the words. Some remained silent. Others nodded in approval. Hamish’s own words felt like large cubes of ham lodged in his throat. *Why waste breath on these lot,* he wondered, but he knew he had to try. Before he could speak, a jingle chimed gently in the commotion. The jester stood, banging a motley glove on the pool table they’d gathered around until every mouth closed once more. ‘Oh, oh, oh I see. You’d like for us to *slither* back into the nest. That will *certainly* stop the Skinner Brothers from clubbing us to death little by little. Go ahead, show them the soft of your bellies. They might mistake you for worms. Not me.’ When Hamish believed for a second there was a voice of friendship, Tom-Tickle-Me-Silly grimaced. To everyone’s surprise, the motley fool leapt onto the table. ‘What we need isn’t to hide and disband. We joined this brotherhood because the problems we face were hurting us long before. The answer isn’t in hiding. No. What we need is a commander who keeps his promises of glory, a Hollow-Oak without a hollow spine. I recall there being a younger brother. One from a sturdier branch of the tree.’

Suddenly Hamish felt his stomach dropping to his bowls. ‘Dany is no fit as a leader than he is my blood. Don’t be ridiculous.’ 

The jester kicked a red cue ball down a pocket of the pool table. ‘It is not as ridiculous as you, commander.’ He punted another. It missed, hitting the edge. ‘You’ve served your term long past its due. Let the younger Oak prove his worth. I hear he's as hard as flint.’ *And breaks as easily.* 

Catching a yellow cue ball before the jester kicked it in, Yuri crooked his head in amusement, fondling it in his palm. ‘I suppose your second choice of command would be yourself, Tom? Lord fool does have a nice ring to it. But I fear others will think we are all fools for picking you.’

That put a smile on the jesters lips. ‘Bah! Why not? My first decision would be to smash a few rotten eggs,’ Tom mocked, hopping back off the table.

You probably didn't realize that I had been waiting and had three different people cut in front of me on separate occasions. I had given up, parked at a pump, gone inside and paid for gas and grabbed a coffee. Pumped my gas, and saw that someone was still getting air. When I was done getting gas, I waited for the BMW to finish and I aggressively whipped into the spot next to the air pump, only realizing after I parked, that the reason your car's reverse lights were on was to position your car closer to the air pump that you had patiently been waiting for. 

You exited your vehicle and I was immediately worried that you were just going to pull the air hose over to your car or yell at me for cutting in front of you. Instead, you very nicely offered to air up my tires. I accepted, though I was shocked and embarrassed and probably did not give you a proper thanks. Except I told you that you restored my faith in humanity. 

What did not restore my faith in humanity, was how as I was pulling away, someone else quickly pulled in, skipping you once again.

I’ve always just used a basic on-off kettle, but I’ve gotten more into coffee and tea over the past few months.  
  
 I’m not a full-on enthusiast or anything, but I’ve noticed that some teas taste weirdly bitter when I make them with boiling water, and my pour-over coffee sometimes comes out harsher than it should.  
  
 A friend told me it might be because I’m using water that’s too hot.

The thing is, I live alone and my kitchen is tiny, so I try not to buy gadgets unless they actually solve a real problem.  
  
 I already have limited counter space and I don’t want to clutter it with something I’ll barely use. But at the same time, I’m trying to cut down on buying coffee outside, so making better coffee at home would help both my wallet and my daily routine.

Does anyone here actually feel the difference that temperature control makes?

Hi all! I’ll keep this concise - my husband tried tiramisu for the first time at a restaurant about a year ago and absolutely loved it and instantly asked me to make it at home. 

I did a bit of research but wasn’t fancying the whole egg thing so I decided to try something different. I figured that the use of egg yolks with sugar etc maybe leads to a custardy type of flavour so I decided to make a small amount of unsweetened concentrated custard using the Birds powder, thinking it might replicate that flavour. I then followed the usual steps of mixing the cooled custard into softened mascarpone, folding in the whipped cream and adding nearly a whole tin of condensed milk to sweeten as I love the rich and creamy taste of it. I’m aware it’s not authentic but it was absolutely delicious and my husband said it was so much better than the restaurant one. I’ve made it a few times like this and anyone that has tried it has been obsessed.

HOWEVER 

I recently decided to let go of custard powder and have been making my own homemade custard (using egg yolks) for any dessert I make and it’s so easy and also the most delicious custard we’ve had. I also came across lots of tiramisu recipes using a zabaglione which sort of resembled part of the homemade custard process. Husband asked for tiramisu again yesterday so I decided I’d try it this way, using a zabaglione, as many people reported it lends a really delicious taste. I was also excited that it’s a touch more authentic. 

I made it and left it to sit overnight in the fridge and we had a taste earlier. It sure was yummy, but it wasn’t mind blowing. The cream filling really just tasted like.. cream? As in, there wasn’t any rich flavour to it or anything that people attributed to the whole egg yolk thing. Husband also said it’s delicious but so far from my best tiramisu using my own recipe. 

What have I done wrong? I’m after a silky creamy rich flavourful cream filling (not moussey or foamy if that makes sense) and I’d appreciate any pointers to how I can achieve this. 

Here is my recipe using zabaglione: 

Zabaglione:
- Put 4 egg yolks and 50g sugar in heatproof bowl and heat over a pot of simmering water whisking continuously for 7-10 mins until pale, thick, creamy and ribbony (note: I did this for much longer than this and whisked very vigorously too so I incorporated a lot of air into it and it also thickened A LOT. I was nervous because the zabiglione itself wasn’t heating enough and I was worried thinking it needed to be hot or the yolks aren’t cooked through enough - I was obvs wrong)
- Add vanilla into it when removed from heat 
- Let cool down slightly 

- Mix 4 spoons coffee with hot water in bowl and maybe little sugar and vanilla and leave to cool down 

Cream:
- In one bowl whip the cream to soft peaks and set aside 
- In another bowl beat mascarpone until smooth then add in the zabaglione 
- Add in up to 1/4 tin condensed milk to taste and mix 
- Gently fold the whipped cream into this mix don’t overmix it 

Assemble:
- Dip ladyfingers in coffee then layer it in dish with cream mixture on top 
- Last layer should be cream 
- Chill overnight 
- Dust cocoa powder before serving

Yesterday as well.

I've noticed that if I take it right after having a dense protein-heavy breakfast along with lots of water and a cup of coffee that I don't get those pains in the morning. So far I've only had food with my second dose once. After looking at other posts on reddit it seems to be linked to food, but I also got some light stomach pains this morning when I took it after breakfast. I didn't have coffee until an hour later so I don't know if that was a contributor or not. It was also a smaller breakfast so I ate a bowl of greek yogurt about ten minutes after taking the medication, but I imagine that it wouldn't be much help considering it was after the medication.

Here is why ""Mental Game"" is mostly a lie (and how to actually fix tilt).","Everyone says ""just don't tilt"" or ""work on your mental game,"" as if it's purely a willpower issue.

I used to tell myself I never tilted. Then I looked at my winrate during long sessions and realized I was lying to myself. After 20 years in the game, I’ve realized that preventing tilt isn't about psychology—it’s about **physiology**.

If your nervous system is fried, your prefrontal cortex (logic) goes offline, and no amount of ""mindset work"" will save you from punting.

I wrote a massive guide on this, but here is the TL;DR for the sub:

**1. Sleep is +EV (Literally)** It’s not just about feeling rested. During deep sleep, your glymphatic system washes metabolic toxins out of your brain. If you skip this, you are playing with a ""dirty brain."" Your emotional regulation is physically compromised.

**2. Stop Over-Caffeinating** Caffeine mimics anxiety. It raises heart rate and cortisol. When you take a bad beat on 3 cups of coffee, your body is already primed for ""fight or flight."" I swapped to L-Theanine and herbal teas (lemon balm/chamomile) during the grind, and the difference in patience is night and day.

**3. The ""Huberman Sigh"" (Emergency Brake)** If you are mid-tilt, you can't ""think"" your way out of it. You need to hack your biology. Do a double-inhale through the nose, and a long exhale through the mouth. It offloads CO2 and physically forces your heart rate down. It’s the only thing I’ve found that works in real-time.

**4. Zoom Out (The Context)** Downswings are only ""real"" if your sample size of life is too small. If you build a rich life outside of poker (gym, family, hobbies), a 10-buy-in downswing mathematically matters less to your overall happiness.

I go into a lot more detail (including the math of downswings and some specific tools) in the full article.

I'm making and pinning this post just in case anybody needs to contact me. My Reddit is on mobile and on the Relay app for Android. It's the only one that isn't missing a lot of content since Reddit banning third-party apps and UK going all authoritarian on the internet. This means that any chat messages or requests are treated as a PM but unlike them - I rarely get the notifications for them and they still resemble PMs. So, if you're feeling masochistic and want to chat with me - it's best to use my Discord, or my email if you want my WhatsApp (or mobile number).

## Everything Else


Hiya, I'm Luc. I haunt the city of Glasgow and I'm an insufferable menace and a disaster magnet. At 36, I'm going through a ginger existential crisis because my hair is now grey. If you want to hire me for a project - I make an excellent shopping trolley as the universe gave me wheels instead of a pair of sexy, long legs (I have legs but they are an outdated model and useless as well as too short!). In my free time, I moan about being a crazed gay cripple who really wanted to be a librarian when he grew up but failed :( .


I'd love to make new friends ... or any friends at all ... because I'm too busy with being a hermit who's afraid of people. If you want somebody in your life who never stops talking, overshares, gathers trauma like Pokémon so that he can bury people under mountains of it, is way into every conceivable topic on the planet besides sports (I mean... I used to be a baseball player, a swimmer and loved to play table tennis. Hell, I even went to the gym regularly like all tech bros do but it was during annual hospital visits on a physio ward), have a long list of media to consume and books to talk about - then, I am your man.


Be warned, I had a heart failure three years ago due to a traumatic event which resulted in brain damage and a brain tumour (Dissolved!), so my focus and memory fluctuate and vary. The trauma sticks around and I can be more fragile than a vase inside of the British Natural History museum. My communication skills are still stuck in the 00s and come with a serving of sarcasm, auto-irony, dark humour and a pre-conception that a globalised socialised Star Trek utopia is the direction that the world should head in. I like to casually insert politics, history, sociology and astrophysics when chatting and my life was fairly turbulent and dark so if it's something that might bother you - I am the worst candidate for anything that you might be plotting.


In my disaster-free time when my brain works - I do graphic design, photography, dubious writing, website development and 3D design. I also play various MMOs but didn't do much recently, however, if you need an extra player for FFXIV, SWTOR, LoL, Minecraft, or RDR2 - hit me up. I have Star Trek installed but didn't get far in it (only beyond prologue) and I used to have ESO, LOTRO, GTA V, WoW (also did not get far there) installed but can reinstall them. I always wanted to play FO76 but never had anybody to play with it. I tried GTA V Online but it never worked properly for me.


If you managed to read through all of this - you have my thanks and if you want to chat to me - I'll always owe you a coffee.


Cheers!

Dito niya pinangarap ang buhay: isang buong araw na may *free Wi-Fi* at unlimited *pork adobo* ni Inay.

Pumasok sa eksena si **Mayumi**. Si Mayumi ay ang *opposite* ni Kiko. Siya ay parang *perpetual motion machine*, laging may ginagawa, laging may *goal*. Architect siya na ang pangarap ay itayo ang pinakamataas na *condominium* sa buong Asya. Sa unang *date* pa lang nila, nag-away na sila dahil mas pinili ni Kiko ang *extra rice* kaysa sa *kale salad* na *in-order* ni Mayumi.

""Kiko,"" sabi ni Mayumi isang hapon, habang nagtitinginan sila. Si Kiko ay nakahiga sa duyan, nagpapalamig gamit ang karton ng Goldilocks. ""Kailan ka ba titigil sa pagiging... *organic hammock*?""

""Babe, hindi mo maintindihan,"" tugon ni Kiko. ""Ang pagpapahinga ay *strategic*. Nag-iipon ako ng enerhiya para sa... *eating*.""

Pero mahal ni Mayumi si Kiko, sa paraang mahal ng isang *spreadsheet* ang isang *random variable*. Nagtagal sila, pero ang *friction* sa kanilang *lifestyles* ay lalong lumalala. Ang *breaking point* ay dumating nang makakuha si Mayumi ng *scholarship* para mag-aral sa ibang bansa.

""Kiko, bukas na ang alis ko. Sa NAIA, *Gate 14*, 4:00 PM. Kung talagang mahal mo ako at handa ka nang magbago... 'Wag kang ma-late.""

Ayan na! Ang *movie moment* ni Kiko.

Alas tres y medya na, at mabilis siyang sumakay ng *tricycle*. Nagmamadali, pawis, pero determinado! Subalit, sa kanto, may biglang humarang: isang *parada* ng mga nagdiwang ng *founding anniversary* ng Samahan ng mga Mahilig sa *Turon*. Napilitan si Kiko na bumaba.

""Sayang, kuya,"" sabi ng *vendor* na naglalako ng *dirty ice cream*. ""Pero may *ube* ako, *special*.""

At doon, naganap ang trahedya. Sa gitna ng *stress*, na-distract si Kiko. ""Sige na nga, isa nga!""

Nang dumating si Kiko sa *Gate 14*, 4:05 PM. Wala na si Mayumi. Ang naiwan lang ay isang *janitor* na nagwa-wax ng sahig, at ang amoy ng *airport coffee*. Umupo si Kiko sa sahig, umiiyak na parang bata. Ang *ube ice cream* niya, tumutulo na.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Ilang taon ang lumipas, naging *successful* si Mayumi sa abroad. Si Kiko? Bumalik sa ilalim ng mangga. Pero isang araw, may dumating na *courier* na may *package* at isang sulat.

*Minamahal kong Kiko,*

*Kung binabasa mo ito, maligaya na ako sa aking bagong buhay, at sana'y maligaya ka na rin. Ang totoo, Kiko, hindi dahil sa adobo o sa pagiging tambay mo kaya ako umalis. Umalis ako dahil may napakabihirang sakit ako—ang ""Acute Paternal Tree Transmogrification Syndrome.""*

*Alam kong baliw, pero ito 'yon: Ang tatay ko, si Mang Ben, ay isang Diwata na nagpanggap na tao. Dahil sa sumpa, tuwing may lalaki na nagpaparamdam ng totoo at purong pagmamahal sa akin, ang tatay ko ay unti-unting nagiging puno—ang puno kung saan sila madalas magpahinga.*

*Kaya nung nagtataka ka kung bakit lalong lumalaki at lumalawak ang anino ng mangga sa tapat ng bahay niyo, habang lalo tayong nagmamahalan... Si Tatay 'yun, Kiko. Nagsasakripisyo para sa kaligayahan ko. Masakit, pero...* **Ang manggang inuupuan mo araw-araw, Kiko? 'Yun ang aking ama.**

*Umalis ako para lang hindi na niya kailangang maging kahoy. Ayokong maging kaligayahan ko ang kanyang pagka-puno.*

*P.S. Huwag mo masyadong i-scratch ang balat, masakit daw.*

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Napatulala si Kiko. Ang mangga! Ang manggang tagapagbigay ng lilim! Si Mang Ben! Bigla siyang tumayo at niyakap ang malaking puno.

""Mang Ben! Pasensiya na po sa mga *pag-utot* ko sa ilalim niyo! Sana po ayos lang kayo!""

Noong gabing iyon, habang umiiyak si Kiko sa tabi ng puno, biglang may *lumabas* mula sa isang *butas* sa balat ng mangga. Ito ay isang *balut*. Pero hindi lang ordinaryong *balut*; ito ay *balut* na may *top hat* at *monocle*.

Ang balut ay umubo, at nagsalita: ""Kiko, hindi ko na kaya ang drama. Kailangan kong umamin. **Ako si Mayumi.** Nag-aral ako, oo, pero ang totoo, may nagbigay sa akin ng *spell* na magiging *balut* ako kapag may nakita akong mas matigas pa sa puso ng lalaki. Kaya nang makita ko kung gaano ka kahirap mag-move on sa *ube ice cream* na natunaw, naging *balut* ako. *Diwata* ng *leche flan* ang nag-spell. *Anyway*, baka gusto mo akong kainin? *Medium rare* ako, parang steak.""

Natigilan si Kiko. Tinitingnan niya ang *balut* na nagsasalita, saka ang *manggang* ama.

""Hay,"" buntong-hininga ni Kiko. ""Ang gulo.""

**Morale Lesson:**

I need gifts for everyone from my mom & dad to my siblings, to my wife. So this is just a general list that I am looking for to give this year. Anything to help start the ideas flowing if you know what I mean.

What is in your useful Christmas gift idea list this year? What have you found that was awesome you received or given and would like for others to give the same thing? Or if you used something practical and useful this past few years that might be a good idea. 

I would to start by saying these are very useful:

* towel warmers (really nice experience out of the shower)

* instant read thermometer (i can't believe people cook without one!)

What are some other ideas?",15,1763669666.0,Gifts,8,0.95,False
