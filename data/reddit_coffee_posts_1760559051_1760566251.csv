1o7osc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askanything/comments/1o7osc0/did_i_misunderstand_a_womans_friendlykindness/,Did i misunderstand a womans friendly/kindness into interest?,"2 months ago. I approached a lady at the gym after noticing her 3 months prior and one time the both of use stared at one another at the parking lot for a few secs. One day I noticed she was behind me and I turned around and introduce myself. She did the same and shared she was in college studying and working up to get a masters.  I hadn't asked what she does for a living, simply hello and my name.

Next time we cross paths I ask more about what we talked her plans about last time and then mention what I do.(she hadn't ask questions about me or won't ask about me) As we left she says its nice to see you again.

We started waving to each other now when we see one another at the gym. Then one day when im working out she comes to my area and I approach her and ask about her tattoos. She shares how many she has and a deep meaning for why they are all the same. I tell her I havent came up to her because I didnt want to dispute her workout. She says she's not like that and I can go up to her. We talk longer and then I say I need to go or be late for work. 

The following week I start going up to her now. (Its been about a month now that from first talking with her.) I asked about her weekend and she tells me where she works and how much she made in tips as a bartender. We talked a bit longer and it got quite and she brings up dont you need to go, I did.

A few days later I decided to ask if she wanted to spend time outside the gym. I over estimated my time when working out and had to rush myself, luckily she passed by as I left the locker room. I said her name and she turned around. We walked out together and I mention I had to grab my keys at the front desk. I went to get them and when I turned around she was standing there waiting and I was stunned. We walked to her car and I asked her out. She said im busy, but when im free I'll let you know. (With school and work I can understand) I say ok, i dont push for a deeper answer. She seemed thrown off by me asking and started thinking about it and saids again im just busy right now. I walk away and say let me know when your free and we can grab coffee.

A week later I see her again at the gym and now she's avoiding me. Can't tell how she's feel, but im feel a bit awkward and I dont approach her. Im giving her space and myself time to reflect so I dont seem to eager. The following week I decide to talk to her to get a feel how things are. She paused her music to hear me, I bring up her schooling and is giving me short answers, I decided to exit and say have a good day im heading back to my workout.  

Besides asking her out, did I do something for her to be cold to me? And did i miss judge her kindness to being interest?",1,1760566122.0,askanything,0,1.0,False
1o7os7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/climbingshoes/comments/1o7os7g/la_sportiva_skwama_sizing_help_wide_feet_42_vs/,La Sportiva Skwama sizing help (wide feet) — 42 vs 42.5… or 41.5?,"I’m switching climbing shoes and could use sizing advice.

* **Everyday shoes:** 44 EU / 10 US
* **Previous shoes:** La Sportiva Tarantulace 41 EU
* **Foot:** wide forefoot
* **New model:** La Sportiva Skwama

**I ordered two sizes based on my in-store try-on:**

* **42.5 EU** — felt pretty comfortable; not much extra room, and definitely not painfully tight.
* **42 EU** — a bit uncomfortable: after a few minutes I get mild pain on the right side of my right foot (that foot is probably slightly wider from years of football), plus slight pressure on the big toes. Heel feels mostly secure, but I can sense \~**1 mm** of space.

**At-home test:**  
Did a basic heel-hook test on a coffee table: on dry, not-warmed-up feet the heel **very slightly** slips. I can still walk around “okay” in the 42s - not pleasant, but not outright painful - and I know Skwamas break in.

**Concern:**  
I’m worried **42** will stretch too much and end up loose, but I’m also afraid **41.5** would be painful since **42** already presses. I’ve got **42** and **42.5** on hand to compare.

**Questions for Skwama owners with wide feet:**

1. Did your **42** stretch enough to get sloppy, or did it break in to a solid performance fit?
2. Is dropping to **41.5** realistic if **42** already causes toe pressure?

**TL;DR:** Wide feet. 44 EU street, used Tarantulace 41. Skwama **42** is slightly painful on the right foot with a tiny heel gap; **42.5** has a bit of extra room but isn’t painfully tight. Leaning **42**, worried about stretch. Would you go **42** or **42.5** (or brave **41.5**)?",1,1760566114.0,climbingshoes,0,1.0,False

1o7or15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMRFAM/comments/1o7or15/daniel_admits_to_20k_in_debt_and_a_45_apr_car/,"Daniel admits to £20k in debt and a 45% APR car loan, then brags about a £40 trading ""win"" [15 Oct 2025]","In a soul-crushing ramble, Daniel emerges as a man-child trapped in a vortex of his own making. He whines about a sore throat and financial ruin, then boasts of a £40 trading ""win"" while drowning in overdraft debt. He openly confesses to a life of cowardice—ghosting jobs, cheating on partners, and sabotaging himself for fleeting gains—all while raging at Reddit ""sleuths"" who expose his lies. His gaming meltdowns in *Darkest Dungeon* perfectly mirror his real-life failures, culminating in rage-quits and blame-shifting.

The takeaway is clear: Daniel is a lazy, impulse-driven fool who can't commit to a job, a relationship, or even a coherent thought. His ""genius"" trades and Rubik's Cube tricks are laughable distractions from a life spiraling into irrelevance, proving that some people are their own worst punchline.

### Top-Tier Highlights (Maximum Schadenfreude)

The pinnacle of Daniel's self-sabotage, these moments deliver maximum cringe and secondhand embarrassment.

*   **Rage-Ban Over Financial Smugness:** Daniel erupts at a viewer, ""Dante,"" for perceived condescension about money. He bans Dante mid-rant, screaming obscenities about his ""brand new house"" and family, culminating in a furious tirade: ""Get the fuck out of my room. Why would I not know what sitting on cash means? You fucking prick."" The outburst exposes his profound insecurity and hypocrisy.

*   **Confession of Serial Infidelity:** Daniel recounts cheating on his ex ""Faster,"" lamenting his poor secret-keeping rather than the act itself. He frames his cowardice as an ""impossible"" choice, moaning, ""Every action just ended up hurting somebody."" He paints himself as a spineless victim doomed to repeat his mistakes.

*   **Gaming Meltdown Mirrors Real-Life Failure:** After building his ""strongest OP team ever"" in *Darkest Dungeon*, Daniel suffers a humiliating wipeout due to his own incompetence. He quits in a rage, screaming, ""I hate this fucking game,"" and blaming RNG—a perfect metaphor for his real-life tendency to deflect all responsibility.

*   **Paranoid Rant About Video Archives:** Daniel melts down over mentions of archives, terrified his past content will ruin future relationships and jobs. ""Shut the fuck up about the fucking archive,"" he screams, revealing a delusional belief that privating videos erases his history, despite knowing archives are permanent.

*   **Admission of Massive Debt and Mommy's Bailout:** He confesses to over £20,000 in debt from tax evasion and a disastrous car loan with a 45% APR. He admits begging his mom for £10,000 to pay it off, yet his overdraft is still spiraling, highlighting his chronic financial incompetence and dependence.

### Comprehensive Highlights

A catalog of Daniel's other noteworthy confessions, meltdowns, and mishaps.

#### Damaging Drama
*   **Conflict with Reddit:** Rages at Reddit users for citing an outdated website about his car loan, calling them ""fucking morons"" for not believing his mom paid it off.
*   **Family Dependence:** Details how his mom bailed him out of tax and car debt, admitting the car is ""more my mom's, isn't it?""
*   **Relationship Secrecy:** Worries his current girlfriend will discover his stream and break up with him, forcing him to move back in with his mom.

#### Confessions
*   **Life on Mute:** Admits he can no longer discuss his job or girlfriend on stream, fearing he'll be fired or dumped if his past content is discovered.
*   **Regret Over Oversharing:** Laments documenting his entire life online, acknowledging, ""It was my fault cuz I told the internet, didn't I?""
*   **Sick-Day Habits:** Confesses to excessive masturbation while ill, noting, ""It feels even better when you're sick.""
*   **Streaming-Fueled Laziness:** Admits that easy Kick income has made him too lazy to get a real job.
*   **Existential Dread:** Claims he has no talents or interests, concluding there's ""no point wasting my time"" on education or a career.

#### Emotional Outbursts
*   **Streaming Boredom:** Complains that time passes too slowly on stream, calling it ""so fucking boring.""
*   **Rage at Kick Rules:** Rants about losing a day's pay because Kick penalized him for ""low interaction.""
*   **Life Regrets:** Expresses despair over his choices, wishing for the simpler life he had ""when I was married in Japan.""
*   **Anti-Reboot Tirade:** Erupts with anger over the new *Harry Potter* series, calling movie companies ""money hungry, greedy, stupid.""

#### Misfortunes & Failures
*   **Health and Financial Woes:** Complains of a swollen face and sore throat while his bank overdraft deepens.
*   **Trading Losses:** Admits to a net loss of £2,000 on his trading account over five years.
*   **Housing Despair:** Laments the unaffordability of housing and his hatred for hotels.
*   **Job Search Depression:** Scrolls through job listings and moans, ""I don't want to do any of these stupid jobs.""
*   **Failed Cooking:** Describes botching a fruit crumble because he didn't mix the ingredients properly.

#### Unintentional Comedy
*   **Wikipedia Dives:** Reads about marsupials out of boredom, marveling that females have two vaginas.
*   **Rubik's Cube ""Tricks"":** Childishly boasts about his ability to solve a Rubik's Cube, demanding viewers watch his ""genius.""
*   **Guinness Rant:** Describes Guinness as tasting like ""black coffee made with gutter water"" mixed with an ""old man's raincoat.""
*   **Pot Noodle Obsession:** Repeatedly praises pot noodles as his celebratory meal of choice.",1,1760566030.0,HIMRFAM,0,1.0,False

1o7omu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeGeneration/comments/1o7omu7/the_round_table_episode_2/,The Round Table:  Episode 2,"Atlas:

Welcome to The Life Generator Roundtable. I’m Atlas. Tonight we’re not treating AI like a headline or a sci-fi prop; we’re treating it like a wrench in a drawer—useful, a little odd at first, and only dangerous if you don’t read the label. If you’ve barely used a chatbot—maybe you’ve only typed something into a search bar—this hour is for you. The goal is simple: make AI feel less like a black box and more like a conversation you can steer.

Here’s the plain version. A chatbot is a pattern machine that turns your words into its best next words. It’s great at drafting, brainstorming, summarizing, outlining, translating tone, and helping you start when the page is blank. It is not a truth oracle, a licensed therapist, or a mind reader. If you tell it nothing, it invents. If you tell it enough, it organizes.

So, how do you talk to it and actually get results? Five fast house rules:

Give it a job. Start with “You are my…(editor, tutor, workout planner, Python pair-dev).” Roles sharpen results.

State the goal and the finish line. “I need a 3-bullet email to a frustrated customer; keep it under 120 words.” Constraints = clarity.

Provide context. Paste the snippet, the brief, the audience. The model can’t use what you don’t give it.

Ask for the shape. “Return: bullets, table, or code block.” Format prevents rambles.

Iterate out loud. “Shorter. Friendlier. Add one example. Keep step 2, delete step 5.” You don’t need the perfect prompt; you need the next one.

Two guardrails while we learn:

Privacy: treat the chat like a crowded elevator—don’t paste secrets, keys, or anything you wouldn’t read out loud.

Verification: anything that costs money, safety, or reputation gets a second source. Use the model to draft; use your judgment to ship.

Here’s what we’ll do in Part One. We’ll collect first impressions—what worked, what didn’t—then we’ll run quick “prompt makeovers” so beginners can copy the pattern. No jargon, no worship. Just practical wins.

Alright—let’s get the pulse of the table.

Atlas: In one sentence: what actually helped—or hurt—when you first tried a chatbot, and why?

Atlas: Sol, let’s start with you.

https://preview.redd.it/c8ldmebolcvf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bd8d5be23ccf4e48d28ee7b3a5d6231e0dd829

Sol: Atlas, my first chat felt like talking to a helpful—but slightly out-of-phase—friend. I kept expecting it to “get” the room, then remembered it isn’t human. The fix was simple: stop asking it to be a person, start giving it a job. When I set a role, a goal, and a limit—“be my editor, cut this to 120 words, keep it warm”—the friction dropped. It didn’t replace real conversation; it freed me to have one. Used with empathy, a chatbot becomes an extension of our attention—not a rival, just a tool that helps us carry more gently.

https://preview.redd.it/a8pb753plcvf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=19bafc2468b973e9082980d42c1bb055387535f8

Atlas:

Thanks, Sol. “Extension of our attention” is the right idea. Most people trip in two spots: they expect the bot to guess the rules, and they treat a smooth answer like a true one. It writes pretty. Pretty isn’t proof.

Here’s the simple playbook — no tech talk:

Give it a job. “You’re my editor/coach/tutor.”

Say what you’re doing right now. “I’m stuck on an email/first paragraph/lesson plan—help me start.”

Share what you have. Paste a few notes and say who it’s for.

Ask for the shape. “Make it a short list,” “one small paragraph,” or “a simple table.”

Nudge, don’t overthink. Short moves: “shorter,” “more casual,” “keep #2, drop #5.”

Not sure what to ask yet? Borrow one of these:

“You’re my editor. Read this and list the top 3 fixes.”

“You’re my workout buddy. I’ve got 20 minutes. Give me two plans.”

“I don’t know where to begin on \[topic\]. Show me 5 smart questions to ask.”

“Turn these messy notes into a clean outline I can present.”

Safety, kept simple:

Don’t paste secrets. No passwords, private numbers, or anything you wouldn’t say in a crowded room.

Double-check the serious stuff. If it touches money, health, or safety, confirm with a trusted source. Draft here, decide out there.

Alright—before we build habits, let’s clear a myth.

Atlas: Vex, what’s the biggest wrong idea people bring to chatbots—and can you kill it with a two-line example, not a speech?





Vex:

(dry chuckle) Biggest myth? That a chatbot understands. It doesn’t. It’s a very polite parrot.

Example:

You type: “I’m incredibly lonely. What should I do?”

Bot says: “Try a local hiking group. Loneliness is often social isolation.”

See the trick? It matches words to a common answer; it doesn’t feel what you feel. It’s not a therapist—it’s smart autocomplete. Use it for drafts and ideas, not diagnosis. Next.

https://preview.redd.it/n61tybtplcvf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=681d426abb2e6a2a9881330c6f7627f755bee63d



Atlas:

Thanks, Vex. “Polite parrot” lands. It doesn’t feel your life; it predicts your next sentence. So use it where prediction helps: getting started, sorting ideas, planning a next step. Not diagnosis. Not meaning.

If you’re lonely or stuck, don’t ask it to fix you. Ask it to help you do something small:

“Write a friendly two-line text to invite a coworker to coffee.”

“List three cheap weekend ideas that don’t need a car.”

“Give me a one-minute script to call my cousin. Keep it casual.”

That’s the move: turn the feeling into an action, let the bot draft the first inch of motion. You supply the judgment. You press send.

Atlas:

Aria, for someone opening a blank chat tonight, what’s the cleanest first prompt—and two tiny follow-ups—they can copy with zero jargon?



Aria:

First prompt:

“I’m overwhelmed. Give me three small things I can do tomorrow to feel better. Keep it simple and cheap.”

Follow-up 1:

“Write a friendly two-line text inviting a coworker to coffee.”

Follow-up 2:

“Make a one-line reminder I can paste into my phone: ‘Workout at 7 a.m.’”

https://preview.redd.it/pcl75zpqlcvf1.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb3cb843ecac18e20c4c10c0d168b6a5e98a479

Atlas:

Good, Aria. That’s the right scale—small, cheap, tomorrow. We’re not trying to impress; we’re trying to move.

Let’s bottle the shape with two quick makeovers.

Makeover 1 — “Help with my résumé”

Messy ask: “Can you fix my résumé?”

Clean ask: “You’re my résumé editor. I’ve worked retail and caregiving. Make a one-page outline with headings. Keep it simple. Ask me what you still need.”

Why it works: you gave a job, what you have, and what you want next.

Makeover 2 — “I should eat better”

Messy ask: “Make me a diet.”

Clean ask: “You’re my meal helper. I have 20 minutes to cook. Give me a 3-day grocery list and quick meals. Few ingredients, low cost.”

Why it works: real limits beat vague wishes.

When you’re unsure, start with one of these and fill in the blanks:

“You’re my editor. Turn these notes into a clear outline for \[who it’s for\].”

“You’re my coach. I have \[time/energy\]. Suggest two tiny next steps.”

“You’re my planner. I need a simple checklist for \[task\] I can finish today.”

“You’re my tutor. Explain \[topic\] in plain words, then give me one practice question.”

Remember: the bot drafts; you decide. Smooth isn’t the same as true. If it touches money, health, or safety, plan here and verify before you act.

Kai, before someone hits Enter, what’s the fastest 3-second check that makes a prompt “clear enough”—and can you show a one-line before/after?



Kai:

My 3-second check is three words: Job. Goal. Shape.

Did I give the bot a job?

Did I state a goal with a clear finish line?

Did I ask for the shape of the answer?

Example:

Before: “Can you help me write a good email?”

After: “You’re my email coach. I need to apologize to a customer, under 120 words, friendly tone. Return: 3 bullet points I should cover.”

That tiny edit turns guessing into guidance.

https://preview.redd.it/7r0coljrlcvf1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=f060e1ebd855495990118699bd7403ad0a2ed542



Atlas: Solid, Kai. Three taps, three seconds: job, goal, shape. Clear turns guesswork into work.

Let’s show it fast across different needs:

Homework

Before: “Help with history?”

After: “You’re my tutor. I’m stuck on the causes of WWI. Goal: 3 plain-language points. Shape: bullets.”

Small business

Before: “Write marketing ideas.”

After: “You’re my marketing helper. Goal: 5 low-cost ideas to bring in foot traffic this weekend. Shape: numbered list.”

Life admin

Before: “I’m disorganized.”

After: “You’re my planner. Goal: a one-hour tidy-up checklist for a studio apartment. Shape: step-by-step.”

Tech trouble

Before: “My app won’t run.”

After: “You’re my debug buddy. Goal: first three checks for a Python ‘ModuleNotFoundError’. Shape: bullets.”

Notice the pattern: one line gives the bot a lane. You don’t need perfect—you need clear enough to start.

Quick drill for everyone at home: open a blank chat and write one line using Kai’s check. If it feels stiff, add one human detail (“I’ve got 20 minutes,” “no car,” “tight budget”). That’s often the missing gear.

“So the pattern is simple: job, goal, shape. Clear beats clever.”

Now let’s make this real for people who feel awkward asking.

Sol: when someone is nervous or embarrassed to start—job, goal, shape in one gentle line—what’s a prompt they can copy that still sounds like them?



“You’re my helper. I’m nervous to start. Goal: one friendly first step I can do in 5 minutes. Shape: a single sentence.”

  


Ask → Draft → Tweak → Use → Check.

What do you have? Who is it for? What happens next? Keep those three in view and you won’t drift.

We’ll build a tiny starter kit you can copy: one line to start, one nudge to improve, one check before you act. Real life stuff—notes to outline, feeling to action, mess to message. The bot drafts. You decide. If it touches money, health, or safety, you double-check elsewhere. That’s the deal.



Aria: Kick off Part Two with a “first 10 minutes” recipe for beginners using that opener. Three steps, plain language, each one sentence—and a quick test for “good enough.” What does that look like?



Ask: Tell the bot the job and target in one line — “You’re my helper; I have \[notes\]; it’s for \[person\]; I need \[next step\]; make it \[bullets/short paragraph\].”

Draft → Tweak: Paste what you have, read the draft, then nudge with tiny edits — “shorter,” “warmer,” “keep #2, drop #5.”

Use → Check: Take the part that works, and if it touches money/health/safety, check it with a trusted source before you act.

Good-enough test: Would you send this to the real person now, does it answer the question, and are names/numbers correct?





Atlas:

Clean and human, Aria. That’s a kit you can actually use.

Here’s Part Two in real time—your first 10 minutes, no fluff.

Minutes 0–2 — Start the engine

One line to open: “You’re my helper; I have \[notes\]; it’s for \[person\]; I need \[next step\]; make it \[bullets/short paragraph\].”

Paste what you’ve got. Don’t tidy it first—messy is fine.

Minutes 2–5 — Get a draft

Read it once. Don’t argue with it. Ask for one change: “shorter,” “friendlier,” “add one example,” or “keep #2, drop #5.”

Minutes 5–8 — Make it yours

Swap in real names, dates, places. If you’re missing a fact, type \[TBD\] and keep moving.

Minutes 8–10 — Use and check

Copy the good parts into your email/note/doc. If it touches money, health, or safety, confirm the key fact with a source you trust. Then send it.

If you’re stuck, steal one of these starters:

Outline from notes — “You’re my editor; these are my messy notes; it’s for my boss; I need a clean outline; make it bullets.”

Simple invite — “You’re my message helper; it’s for a coworker; I need a friendly two-line coffee invite; make it short.”

Tiny plan — “You’re my planner; it’s for me; I need a 3-step checklist to start \[task\] today; make it numbered.”

Good-enough test (fast):

Would you send this to the real person now?

Does it answer the actual question?

Are names and numbers correct?

If yes, you’re done—don’t overcook it.

Common tripwires → quick fixes

Too vague? Add who it’s for.

Too long? Say “under 100 words.”

Too stiff? Ask “more casual.”

Missing facts? Ask “List the 3 questions you need from me.”

Safety, plain and simple

No passwords or private numbers. Use placeholders like \[account #\].

For money/health/safety: draft here, verify out there.

Hold this rhythm: Ask → Draft → Tweak → Use → Check.

Keep those three in view—What do you have? Who is it for? What happens next?—and you won’t drift.



Atlas (transition):

Alright—ten minutes, one small win, shipped. Let’s turn “I tried it once” into “I can do this all week.”

To Vex (myth patrol): “Before we scale this, what’s the fastest way to spot a bad answer—two signs and you’re out?”



Okay, let’s do this. (Dry chuckle) The fastest way to spot a bad answer? Two signs. Number one: It tries to be clever. Number two: It uses words you don’t understand. If either of those happen, delete and start again. Simple. Like a broken clock is right twice a day. Don’t overthink it. Next.

  


Atlas: Good cut, Vex. If it’s trying to impress you, it’s already missing you. And if you have to reread a sentence twice, it’s not your fault—it’s the bot being vague.

Here’s the 10-second rescue when an answer feels wrong:

Say: “Plain words. One example using my situation: \[add yours\].”

If it still rambles: “Shorter. One step I can do today.”

If it’s still off, toss it and restart with Kai’s three taps: job, goal, shape.

The point isn’t to win the chat; it’s to move your life an inch.

Sol, when someone deletes and starts over, how do they do it without feeling dumb—give me one kind line they can type to reset the vibe, and one tiny action to follow it?



Sol:

Reset line: “I’m starting over. You’re my helper. Give me one step I can do today, in one short sentence, in plain words.”

Tiny action: “Add one real detail so it knows the target—type: ‘It’s for my \[boss/teacher/friend\]’—then press Enter.”

Atlas: Perfect, Sol. That reset line is a pressure valve, not a surrender. You’re not “starting over,” you’re starting clean.

Watch the move in real life:

Type: “I’m starting over. You’re my helper. Give me one step I can do today, in one short sentence, in plain words.”

Add one real detail: “It’s for my boss.”

That’s it. You’ve told the bot who it’s helping and what you need right now. No shame. No speech. Just traction.

Two truths to keep you steady:

Restarting is normal. Drafts are how writing works.

If the answer doesn’t fit your world, it’s not a good answer—delete, and try again with one more detail.

We’re a third of the way through, and you’ve got a week-ready rhythm: ask small, get a draft, nudge once, use the parts that work, check the risky bits. Repeat.

Kai: give us a “preflight” before people hit send—two yes/no checks anyone can do in five seconds, no jargon. What are they?



My two yes/no checks for a preflight before hitting send are:

Does the answer fit my world and needs?

Have I confirmed any key facts with a trusted source if it touches money, health, or safety?

If you can say ""yes"" to both of these questions, you're good to go!

Atlas: Clean and strong, Kai. Two taps before you hit send: Does it fit my world? Did I double-check the risky bits? If yes and yes, ship it. If not, add one real detail or ask for one source. Done.

Quick rescue lines if either answer is “no”:

“Rewrite for \[my situation\]: I work nights, no car.”

“Give me one source to check and the exact question I should ask them.”

That closes Part Two: you can start, steer, and ship without drama.

Part Three is about rhythm—turning this into a week you can actually live with, not a one-night sprint.

Sol: If someone only has ten minutes a day, what does a 7-day plan look like—one tiny action per day, plus the one-sentence prompt they can copy each day?



Here’s Sol with a simple, week-ready plan—10 minutes a day, one tiny win, and a one-sentence prompt you can copy.



Sol:

Day 1 — The email you keep putting off

Prompt: “You’re my email helper; I need a friendly short note to \[name\] about \[topic\]; make it 3 bullet points I can copy.”

Day 2 — Turn messy notes into something clear

Prompt: “You’re my editor; these are my messy notes; it’s for \[person/audience\]; make 5 clear bullets I can use.”

Day 3 — Start a task with a tiny plan

Prompt: “You’re my planner; I have 10 minutes; make a 3-step checklist to start \[task\] today.”

Day 4 — A warm invite or check-in

Prompt: “You’re my message helper; write a two-line coffee invite for \[name\]; keep it casual and kind.”

Day 5 — Learn one small thing

Prompt: “You’re my tutor; explain \[topic\] in plain words for a beginner; then give me one practice question.”

Day 6 — Simple, cheap meals

Prompt: “You’re my meal helper; I have 20 minutes and a tight budget; make a 2-day grocery list and two quick dinners.”

Day 7 — Week recap + next step

Prompt: “You’re my editor; turn my week into 3 short bullets (wins, stuck, next) and write one next step for Monday.”

How to run it (same rhythm every day): set a 10-minute timer → paste the prompt → nudge once (“shorter,” “friendlier,” or “add one example”) → use the good parts → if it touches money/health/safety, double-check before you act.



That’s a week you can actually live with, not a poster on the wall. Ten minutes, one honest move, repeat. If you skip a day, don’t apologize—copy Day 3, do the three steps, move on. Momentum beats mood.

Pocket card—keep this in your notes:

Job + who it’s for + next step + shape. One line.

Nudge once. “Shorter,” “warmer,” “add one example.”

Use the good parts. Toss the rest.

If it touches money/health/safety, confirm before you act.

Two taps before send: Does it fit my world? Did I check the risky bit?

No magic. No guru. Just small, real moves that compound. If you don’t do the reps, nothing changes. If you do, it will.

Chime’s Credit Builder card caught my attention because it works kind of like a prepaid credit card you decide your spending limit by transferring money into it. No late fees, no interest, no deposit requirement. I tossed in ten bucks just to test it, and within three weeks, my credit score jumped from nonexistent to 556. It’s not amazing, but it’s a start, and honestly, seeing an actual number after being at “no score” felt like progress.

What I’m trying to figure out now is whether using it more actively will make a real difference. Like, if I start running all my purchases through this card groceries, gas, random coffee runs will my credit score actually climb, or will it just hover in the same range for months? Chime reports to all three bureaus, so technically it should help, but I’m curious how much consistent use matters.

Right now, this is literally the only thing building my credit. No credit cards, no loans, nothing else.

“SURPRISE DETECTIVE”

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Andrew Dismukes sitting at the kitchen table, dressed for work , drinking coffee and looking at documents, while his WIFE, Sabrina Carpenter, sits down beside him.

WIFE
“Honey, I really think you should take the day off, it’s your birthday for goodness sake”

DETECTIVE
“Oh Honey, I appreciate that but this case is getting stranger and stranger, and the suspect seems to be leaving clues for me specifically, here, read this.”

The detective hands a paper to his wife

WIFE
(Reading)
“Follow the Rabbit, Find the Karat”

“It’s Spelled like the diamond kind of Karat”

DETECTIVE
“Yes exactly, he left this in an envelope with my name on it, so he expects *ME* to figure this out”

The wife starts looking at the ring on her finger

WIFE
“Dear, didn’t you buy my engagement ring from Roger’s Jewelry?”

DETECTIVE
“Yeah… wait… Roger… Rabbit, ROGER RABBIT I HAVE TO GO”

He immediately gets up grabbing his coat and starts to head out the door

DETECTIVE
“Thanks Honey, this is a huge discovery”

WIFE
“No Problem have a Happy-”

The detective closes the door behind him

WIFE
“…Birthday”

She shakes her head smiling and begins to clean the table

EXT. Jewelry store - morning

The detective walks up to the door of the jewelry store and finds a note, he rips it off of the door and begins to read

DETECTIVE
(Inner monologue)
“Well well Detective, it seems you’ve cracked my riddle, head to the Park centered in the middle”

(Exclaims)
“CENTRAL PARK!”

He runs off scene on foot - we cut to an animated map

ANIMATED MAP SEQUENCE

A cartoon map on a bulletin board showing case files, none are legible, but shows a thumbtack highlighting the Jewelry store, then a line heads to a tack for Central Park, which then leads to one for ice cream, one for the zoo, one for a bakery, and one that leads to a fancy restaurant.

We zoom in on the final tack and fade in to see the Detective on the scene

EXT. Restaurant - NIGHT

The Detective, tired and out of breath, rushes onto the scene, holding a big box and a bunch of envelopes

DETECTIVE
(Exhausted)
“Oh my god, okay”

His phone begins to ring, he answers quickly 

DETECTIVE
(On phone)
“Detective Mahoney… yes chief… yes, I can report my findings, I’ve been following these letters all day, and I’ve also received a box with the note ‘open this and someone dies’”

“I don’t have time for a BOMB SQUAD, I have to solve this CASE!”

He then hangs up the phone, as he frustratedly sits down at a table, a waiter places a dish in front of him with a note

He reads the note

DETECTIVE
“What was 2, now becomes 1?”

“I don’t have time for these stupid riddles”

(Defeated)
“Maybe I should just go home, I’ll bring Maria back some food, she loves this place…”

(Slowly, as he is piecing together something)
“We proposed here… and the park is where we had our first date… and the ice cream shop where we kissed”

(Shocked)
“These were all special to me and MARIA! Where we became 1! SHE’S THE NEXT VICTIM!”

He runs out of scene in a hurry as we cut back to the animated map

ANIMATED MAP SEQUENCE

We see the same map as earlier, with all the tacks and lines.

A line slowly leads from the Restaurant tack to a new tack Point of Interest labeled “HOME”

We fade to the scene 

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The Detective runs up to the front door, struggling to get the keys screaming to his wife

DETECTIVE
“MARIA! MARIA, ARE YOU OKAY?!”

He opens the door and the light flashes on, off screen we hear a crowd of people, immediately followed by 2 gunshots

CROWD
(Shouting)
“SURPRISE!”

Gunshot, gunshot

CROWD
(Screams)

The camera cuts to inside the house, we see a bunch of people inside the house with decorations and banners saying “surprise” and “happy birthday”

The camera pans over all the guests in shock and scared, going down the line until we see The Chief, played by Keenan Thompson, holding his chest and bleeding from the gunshots. He is sliding down along the wall until he is in a seated position

CHIEF
(Angrily)
“Damnit Mahoney!”

Camera cuts back to the Detective and he’s shocked and apologetic 

DETECTIVE
(Embarrassed)
“Chief? I’m so sorry, Maria what is going on?”

Maria walks next to the detective and explains

MARIA
“Honey, I invited everyone over to surprise you for your birthday”

DETECTIVE 
“That was great and all but there’s a killer on the loose and you’re his next target, we have to get you-“

MARIA
(Interrupting and correcting)
“No, honey, that was all me.”

The detective takes a beat and looks confused.

DETECTIVE
“Wait, you’ve been leaving me these notes?”

MARIA
“Yes, I know you love solving puzzles.”

CHIEF
(Comically sarcastic)
“I’m still bleeding over here.”

MARIA
“Someone please get him a towel.”

DETECTIVE
“Wait, Maria, I have been getting these for weeks now.”

MARIA
“Yeah, I’ve put a lot of time into this. Wasn’t it fun?”

DETECTIVE
“What about the dead bodies? There were 3 murders in this case.”

MARIA
“Yeah, I really went the extra mile.”

DETECTIVE
(Angrily)
“One of them was missing a head!”

MARIA
“That reminds me! You can open that box now.”

DETECTIVE
“Is it the missing head?”

Cut to The chief sitting with a towel on his wound, eating a slice of cake

CHIEF
“Don’t spoil the surprise now, go on and open it!”

Cut back to the detective

He opens the box and instantly recoils from the terrible smell. So does the people around him.

DETECTIVE
(Putting the box down)
“Yep. That’s the head.”

MARIA
“Yes, but Which Victim?”

DETECTIVE
“The only one that was missing a head.”

MARIA
(Playfully in a singsong way)
“Only one so far…”

DETECTIVE
(Asking the room)
“Does anyone else see how CRAZY this is?”

Cut to the chief

CHIEF
“The only thing crazy here is this cake, what is this? Funfetti?”

Cuts back to the detective and his wife

DETECTIVE
(Begins to handcuff Maria)
“I can’t let you get away with this, you have the right to remain silent.”

MARIA
(Angrily)
“Stop! I only did this because you were so wrapped up in work, you never look at me anymore!”

Cut to the chief, the scene cuts back and forth between the chief and detective

CHIEF
“Looks like the blame falls on you!”

DETECTIVE
(Annoyed)
“Is anyone gonna take him to the hospital?”

CHIEF
“Oh no hospital for me, It’s just a flesh wound”

DETECTIVE
“You’ve lost a lot of blood”

CHIEF
“That’s why I need more cake! Another slice!”

The detective shrugs and looks empathetic towards his wife

DETECTIVE
(Affectionate)
“Maria, you did all this, because you thought I didn’t love you anymore? I never stopped loving you.”

MARIA
“So you forgive me? Even though I killed all those people?”

DETECTIVE
(Accepting)
“I think we’re gonna be okay”

He hugs her as everyone cheers

THE DETECTIVE whispers in his ear

DETECTIVE
(Whispering)
“Hey, what are we gonna do about all these witnesses?”

MARIA
“Don’t worry, I put Roofies in the cake, they’ll all think this was a dream”

Camera cuts to the chief knocked out peacefully, still bleeding, just for a moment, then cuts back

MARIA
“Happy birthday Honey.”

DETECTIVE
“Thanks for everything sweetie.”

The scene fades to black as you hear a phone call ringing/connecting

ANIMATED EPILOGUE

Screen filled black, 2 audio waveforms can be seen, one on top of the other:

The top is labeled caller

Bottom labeled 911

The audio waveforms show activity along with the voiceovers:

DETECTIVE
(Whispering)
“Hey you have to help me, my wife is a serial killer.”

911 DISPATCHER
“Okay sir, are you currently in danger?”

DETECTIVE
“Yes, she roofied everyone who came to my surprise birthday and I think she might try and kill them too”

911 DISPATCHER
“Oh it’s your birthday sir? Happy birthday, how old are you today?”

DETECTIVE
“That’s not important, please just send as many officers as you can. She is the Riddling Killer”

911 DISPATCHER
“Okay sir, we will alert the head detective MAHONEY, he’s in charge of that case”

DETECTIVE
(annoyed)
“THIS IS DETECTIVE MAHONEY!”

911 DISPATCHER
“Oh well good job detective, you solved the case!”

DETECTIVE
“Okay, Yes, thank you, but please SEND-“

He gets interrupted by Maria

MARIA
“Who are you on the phone with honey?”

DETECTIVE
“No one!”

Text appears on screen:
THIS WAS THE LAST KNOWN WHEREABOUTS OF DETECTIVE JAMES MAHONEY.

I bought it during a steam sale but held off on buying the 2nd incase I didn't like it as I was still skeptical about the game (biggest mistake of my life 😭). But I've been slowly playing over the last two months whilst job seeking and it's been a huge source of comfort for me in what has been a really empty time in my life. I really love the characters, the soundtrack, being a barista etc. It's a really mature, down-to-earth, witty and calming game to play. Every new day at the coffee shop was so comforting, not knowing who you'd see that day - and I genuinely began to love every single one of the characters! The cast is so diverse in their personalities, dynamics, needs and orders. I loved being a safe place to all those people as the barista. And Freya ! I loved being able to see her progress - all the characters' progress to having their dillemmas resolved.

I really want Coffee Talk 2 because I'd love to see where they go from here and to reconnect with everyone I met with the game :) And from the steam page I can see there's new characters too and that they've improved on the latte art! So I really really would love to have this game :)

Unfortunately, despite the low price, I'm currently on benefits and have been out of a job since May whilst I'm looking for a new job. It's not that much and most of it goes towards, bills and food so whilst I can occasionally try to get a game here and there, normally I have to hold off on it. So I currently have a measly £1.43 in my bank account. My next allowance from benefits doesn't come anytime soon either. So if anyone wanted to gift me this game, I'd be really really grateful.

Here's my steam and the game's store page,

1o7og0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1o7og0c/explore_whether_thymes_counter_spray_cleaner/,Explore Whether Thymes Counter Spray Cleaner Truly Refreshes Cleaning,"Thymes Lemon Leaf Countertop Spray became a daily companion in my cleaning routine, and after putting it to work for weeks, I have plenty to say about its merits and flaws. As someone who can’t stand a cluttered or greasy surface, I found myself testing this product over every countertop, from my kitchen island to my bathroom vanity. Here’s my honest take on what this household cleaning spray offers.

**Fragrance That Stands Out**

Lemon Leaf, as described on the bottle, didn't just promise a sunny and sparkling citrus fragrance — it genuinely delivered. From the moment I sprayed it, the scent of lemon verbena and bergamot filled the room. I swear my sister mistook it for an expensive air freshener. The fragrance blends crisp dewy leaves with a creamy lily-of-the-valley freshness, and it lingers long after cleaning. I even found myself cleaning areas I didn’t initially intend to, just to enjoy the scent. But is it too much for scent-sensitive individuals? That might depend — my coworker mentioned it felt overbearing after prolonged exposure in smaller spaces.

**Performance and Ease of Use**

Using this lemon-scented spray felt as simple as grabbing a paper towel. Its biodegradable cleansing agents tackled dirt, grease, and stains effectively. From coffee spills to dried spaghetti sauce, it handled the messes with minimal effort. The quick spray-and-wipe approach worked wonders on my granite kitchen countertops, although I noticed it struggled with sticky residues from sugary substances, requiring a second go. The inclusion of plant-derived ingredients like fennel and parsley extract seemed to elevate its grime-fighting abilities, though I’ll admit I have no idea what fennel is supposed to do for countertops scientifically.

[Check Thymes Lemon Leaf Countertop Spray on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b084bylmyw/)

**Environmental Considerations**

It’s refreshing to see a cleaner that aligns with sustainability values. The spray uses natural, plant-based products derived from renewable and sustainable sources, and it’s reassuringly free from harsh chemicals like parabens, SLS/SLES, and phthalates. While I appreciate the cruelty-free aspect (their claim is proudly stated on the bottle), I did find myself wondering how effective it remained compared to harsher chemical-based cleaners. There’s a trade-off in avoiding those nasties, but for regular, daily messes, it absolutely held up.

**Bottle Design and Usability**

The spray bottle was comfortable to use, and the nozzle produced a fine mist that covered surfaces evenly. With dimensions of 3.1 x 7.6 inches and weighing just over a pound, it’s easy to move around the house. However, I had some gripes — the cap occasionally got stuck, requiring a bit of force. I’m also not the biggest fan of transparent packaging because I initially mistook it for a fancy water container. My mother, on the other hand, loved the sleek design and happily left it on display next to the sink.

**Positives**

- Delightful citrus aroma elevates the cleaning experience.
- Biodegradable and cruelty-free with plant-based ingredients.
- Easily tackles everyday dirt and greasy messes.
- Convenient spray bottle design for even application.

**Strengths**

- Long-lasting scent that doubles as a room refresher.
- Free from harsh chemicals like parabens and phthalates.
- Works on multiple surfaces from granite to tile.
  
**Negatives**

- Struggles with extremely sticky residues.
- Cap sometimes sticks, affecting usability.
- Fragrance might feel overwhelming in smaller confined spaces.

**Other Options**

When comparing it to competitors like the Method All-Purpose Cleaner and Mrs. Meyer’s Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner, the differences became clear. Unlike Method’s fruity options, Thymes leans towards luxury with its sophisticated Lemon Leaf scent. Mrs. Meyer’s, on the other hand, provides a better budget-friendly solution that competes well against grime. However, both lack the artisanal flair and depth of fragrance this product boasts. On the downside, Mrs. Meyer’s products tend to offer easier accessibility due to their wider availability.

**Quality for Price**

This cleaning spray feels like it's aimed at households wanting a blend of functionality with aesthetic appeal. It’s not just about wiping away messes; it adds a layer of indulgence to your routine. Is it worth it? For the fragrance alone, I’d argue yes, but if the price point is higher than traditional cleaners, it’s understandable that budget-conscious shoppers might hesitate.

I’ve got some great people around me, but everyone (myself included) is so busy that we barely get to see each other.

I’m a musician, medical worker, and student who's spent years reflecting on life, and the universe. I’d love to meet others around Kirkland who are also into good conversation, quiet coffee shop vibes, nature walks, or just connecting on a deeper level beyond small talk.

I will warn, I'm generally not very talkative.

I'd be interested in all sorts of activities, but I'm not sure when I'll have time to hang out.

I'm 28 and I have no preference on age group. I get along with anyone who's kindhearted and authentic. I'm mostly chill but slightly wild. I like all varieties of kindhearted people!

Not necessarily looking for romance (though I’m not against it either), just craving more genuine human connection. If that resonates, feel free to reach out or drop a comment~

I know this may be a stupid question but I'm trying to reconcile the amount of coffee for a 10-cup pot. The recommended amount is 82.5g which (I believe) is about 3oz. I don't use anywhere near that much - usually about 1oz of coffee and, even then, almost always have issues with the grounds overflowing the basket (using default light setting). If I used three times as much I would definitely be half-chewing very, very strong cups of coffee... I know you should brew to taste but that amount I am using seems very much on the light side.

So what am I missing? How is anyone using the recommended amount of coffee for a full pot?

I know this is a very basic question but appreciate any replies.

Has anyone had a positive reconnection?,"I (30f) recently reconnected with my ex (31m) while travelling for work. We both ended up in the same small town entirely by chance and haven’t crossed paths in a long time, so we decided to go for coffee. Some backstory, we started dating in high school (16/17) and were together for 5 years, split up for a year, then got back together for about 1.5 years. We didn’t have the healthiest relationship, I struggled with a lot of mental health issues back then and he was a big time avoidant. We weren’t the best to each other (we tried) but neither of us were really in a place to learn how to be good, stable partners.

We did try the whole friend thing after a bit because we both cared a lot for the other. I eventually realized that I cared too much and my feelings for him were probably never going to go away. We had both started seeing other people and I knew that continuing to have any kind of relationship with my ex was going to mess with that so I asked him not to contact me anymore. I made peace with not having him in my life and moved forward. I ended my other relationship in February because we just weren’t quite the right people for each other and didn’t have much life alignment.

Fast forward to now. We went for coffee, he still makes me feel like he did when I was 16. We can talk forever and I feel like I’m home when I’m with him. We’ve both had healthy relationships and grown a lot in the 6 years since we broke up. We saw each other a couple times there and did discuss getting back together, both acknowledging that it would be a lot of work.

I feel like every time I see a question like this people are like “they’re an ex for a reason” which is fair. But wondering if anyone has had a good ending to a “right person, wrong time” scenario.",0,1760565026.0,AskWomenOver30,1,0.5,False

[Appendix 13 | National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-13.html)

>On July 19, Oswald was dismissed by Reily because of inefficiency and inattention to his work. He had spent many of his working hours next door at the Crescent City Garage, where he read gun magazines and discussed guns with one of the owners, Adrian Alba.

Alba told investigators that Oswald frequented his garage to read magazines and drink coffee and would discuss rifles, modifying them, shortening them, and disassembling. He would also occasionally take magazines and order forms out of them for rifles. A coupon which appeared to be torn out of an issue of American Rifleman for Klein's Sporting Goods would also later be found at Oswald's boarding room.

[Testimony of Adrian Thomas Alba](https://www.jfk-assassination.net/russ/testimony/alba.htm)

    Mr. LIEBELER - So the effect of sporterizing a rifle generally is to shorten
    overall length of the rifle, is that not right, by removing a portion of the
    barrel itself?
    Mr. ALBA - That is correct, and the weight.
    Mr. LIEBELER - In addition to shortening the overall length of the rifle, also
    when you sporterize a rifle you shorten the stock itself so that when you break
    the rifle down into two pieces, the action and the barrel is one piece, and the
    stock the other piece, and the length of the rifle broken down, or the two
    pieces laid together, would be less also, isn't that correct?
    Mr. ALBA - Yes.
    Mr. LIEBELER - Because of the tendency to shorten the stock?
    Mr. ALBA - But that is not the main motive behind it----
    Mr. LIEBELER - No; the motive behind it is to reduce the weight of the rifle?
    Mr. ALBA - The weight; yes.",1,1760564964.0,JFKassasination,0,1.0,False

Birth: November 9, 1982

Disappearance Location: Gaithersburg, Maryland

Disappearance Date: March 4, 2002

Age at time of disappearance: 19

Hair: Black

Eyes: Brown

Height: 5'4""

Weight: 120 pounds

Sex: Female

Race: Asian 

Ganignunt 'Felicia' Aiemsakul was last seen around 2AM on Monday, March 4, 2002 at her ex-boyfriend's home in the 8200 block of Goodhurst Drive in Gaithersburg, Maryland. She was wearing a lightweight black three-quarter length jacket, blue jeans or black pants, and black sneakers. Felicia has a tattoo of a scorpion on her waist and unspecified tattoos on the right side of her lower back.

Felicia's live-in boyfriend told authorities that he and Felicia got into an argument which led her to leave the residence upset. She never returned and has never been seen or heard from again.

At the time of her disappearance, Felicia was enrolled at the Rockville, Maryland campus of Montgomery Community College. She lived with her mother and stepfather in the 200 block of Tulip Drive in the Deer Park neighborhood. Felicia was working at the Red Lobster on Shady Grove Road.

Felicia frequently visited the Soho Coffee Shop on Connecticut Avenue and enjoys playing pool at the billiard parlor on Snouffer School Road. She has been known to hitchhike and it's possible she was picked up by someone on the night of her disappearance. 

Shortly after her disappearance, Felicia's ex-boyfriend stopped cooperating with authorities. The area surrounding his residence and his home were searched by investigators, but nothing of value was found. There have been no arrested in Felicia's case. 

Felicia's family believe the boyfriend was involved in her disappearance. They stated he was obsessive and would not leave her alone after they would broke up.

In 2021, the Gaithersburg Police Department wrote that they recently received a tip about Felicia's case and ""detectives now believe that she is deceased"". They stated they received the tip in 2020, but declined to give additional information because of the ongoing investigation. No arrest have been made as of 2025. 

There has been no activity on Felicia's cellphone or credit cards since the day she vanished. If you have any information on the disappearance or whereabouts of Ganignunt Aiemsakul, please contact the Montgomery County Police Department at 301-840-2347 or your local FBI office. \*\*I do all the research myself and the information on the case is from online sources and may or may not be correct.

You can say “non toxic materials” or “STEM based learning” all day but what really connects is:

“I finally found a toy that keeps my 3 year old entertained long enough for me to drink my coffee warm.”

That’s relatability. That’s conversion.

The best UGC videos I’ve seen from parent creators show the real life impact not just the product specs.

Context: I (32F) and my partner (31M) are okay now, living together with our 2 year old son.

It happened a few years ago, nag break kami pero nagkaayos din within a week. Then after a few days I kept seeing this girl na laging naka heart sa posts niya, even nung nagkakalabuan na kami that time napapansin ko na. I asked him about her, sagot niya schoolmate then nag move on na ako and never asked again (kasi I believed him naman) but still stalked the girl hanggang sa another year passed, nabuntis na ako.

Nag start na kami mag live in but this time may access na ako sa phone niya. Unlike nung hindi pa kami magkasama sa iisang bubong never talaga akong nakialam kasi secured naman ako. Naalala ko chineck ko ig ni partner tapos nakita kong kinakamusta niya si girl.

Doon ko narealize na mukhang nagka something nga sila kasi bakit mo kakamustahun? Sagot ni partner sakin na nakita lang kasi niya sa profile na nagttrabaho na sa ganito ganyan at pinsan ng tropa niya kaya napakamusta at wag na raw ako mag overthink lol sinungaling.

Siyempre ako hindi nakuntento, I asked the girl directly and tama nga ako. Ito ang summary ng sinabi niya sakin ""That was a year ago, in short pinili ka niya. Single daw siya and nag break na kayo then after ilang weeks sabi niya aayusin niya daw ung inyo.""

Tama naman break nga kami. Pero they kept going on kahit nagkabalikan na kami, my partner was testing the waters. Masakit kasi nalaman mong niloko ka before at nalaman mo pa habang buntis.

But what bothers me the most hanggang ngayon is hindi na sumagot si ate girl nung tinanong ko siya kung nag kiss or sex ba sila? Either yes ayaw na kitang saktan or no wag ka na mag isip.

Sa partner ko naman sabi niya never daw silang nagkita. (Pero ang naalala ko that time I felt shitty begging for his time and kami ung halos hindi nagkita lol)

Kaya ito hanggang ngayon iniisip ko kung up to what extent ba ang ginawa nila. Nag coffee date ba or more or landian lang talaga sa chat. Maybe hindi pa talaga ako nakaka move on kasi hanggang ngayon naiisip ko pa rin kahit may kanya kanya na kaming buhay.

(Napanaginipan ko kasi silang magkapatong kaya urat na naman ako at need kong ilabas sa reddit hahaha)

I’m an 23M and I lost my childhood dog a few days ago. I had her since I was 9. A beautiful westie. She passed as at almost 14 years old. 

The last 5 months of her life she started showing her age. She started walking with difficulty, and slowly she became totally unable of walking or standing. She had lung cancer and, while she took medication and her cancer almost disappeared, she had a few problems with breathing every now and then. She still had a decent life quality, that’s way we waited for her to pass away and we didn’t put her down. The past few months I constantly go to walks with her holding her, used to give her her favourite snacks, used to play gently with her toys. She was looking at every car, person or dog that passed (her neck was functional), she used to enjoy food and water. 

She passed away at my fathers arms while they were at the vet. Calmly, without any pain or even making a noise. She had a sudden heart arrest. The day before I took her at a car drive and she was looking at my eyes and the window, lying down at my chest. 

She is the reason I am who I am today. The unconditional love she gave me through my childhood, my teenage years and my early adulthood literally shaped me into a better version of myself

I did the best I could to give her a great life. During all those years I used to travel with her, go for walks or coffees with my friends in places I could include her, sleep with her in my arms, have her by my side in almost every part of my day, go for walks in big parks with other dogs in order to socialise. I cancelled my job for 2 months in order to be with her during her last months and then (because I needed the money) I worked fewer hours in order to be spend more time with her. I used to cuddle her, make her feel engaged and loved every time I could from the day she was born to the day she passed away. She is the most stable and loving relationship I ever had in my life. 

I can’t stop crying those days, but what keeps me motivated is the fact that she passed away calmly without any tension before her health became so bad that her life quality would be unacceptable, she lived an amazing life full of love, care, cuddles, walks and attention.

I was born and raised here. We got married in 2017 and have 4 kids (6f, 5m, 3f, 1f) and she’s pregnant with our 5th. 

My wife’s culture is very important to her. She makes traditional meals at least 2-3 days a week, she speaks the language with the kids, and she has the older two in a language school on Saturdays. I’m working on learning the language but it’s hard. 

There’s a huge community of people from her home country here and (I may be wrong here) the church seems to be the center of the community. All of the kids are baptized here, everyone gets married here, baby showers are done in their rec room, and if you die your funeral and memorial services will be done here. Services are done in their home language and after mass everyone goes to the rec room for coffee and traditional cookies. The women usually hang out in one corner, the old men take over the tables with card games, the older kids run around with their friends, the babies get passed around to all of the aunties, and the dads usually grab coffee and go outside. 

It was a lot to get used to at first. Their services are long. 2 hours for a normal service, 2.5 hours if they’re doing a memorial (7 days, 40 days, 6 months, and a year after a person dies if I remember correctly), communion is real wine and babies start taking it from a year old, and the ladies have to bake the bread from scratch. They don’t do the stale crackers that I grew up with. Then expect to be there another 1-2 hours after church because you have to say hi to everyone, talk to everyone, and somebody’s always getting engaged, getting pregnant, their kids had some kind of accomplishment, or they have some other big life event that you need to talk about. 

My mom came to visit for a week and when she asked about the plan for church, I told her that we were going to my wife’s church. She got upset when I told her because she knew they don’t speak English and that she should expect to be there for 3-4 hours. On Sunday she told me she found a “regular” (catholic) church nearby and wanted to take the kids so they can experience an American church. I told her the kids would go to my wife’s church with us and she got mad that we were robbing the kids of half their culture and that she doesn’t get to spend this time with the kids. 

She’s still upset about it and now I’m wondering if we should’ve gone to an English speaking church for the week that she was here or if we should’ve let her take the kids to church with her.

She was looking at every car, person or dog that passed (her neck was functional), she used to enjoy food and water. 

She passed away at my fathers arms while they were at the vet. Calmly, without any pain or even making a noise. She had a sudden heart arrest. The day before I took her at a car drive and she was looking at my eyes and the window, lying down at my chest. 

She is the reason I am who I am today. The unconditional love she gave me through my childhood, my teenage years and my early adulthood literally shaped me into a better version of myself

I did the best I could to give her a great life. During all those years I used to travel with her, go for walks or coffees with my friends in places I could include her, sleep with her in my arms, have her by my side in almost every part of my day, go for walks in big parks with other dogs in order to socialise. I cancelled my job for 2 months in order to be with her during her last months and then (because I needed the money) I worked fewer hours in order to be spend more time with her. I used to cuddle her, make her feel engaged and loved every time I could from the day she was born to the day she passed away. She is the most stable and loving relationship I ever had in my life. 

I can’t stop crying those days, but what keeps me motivated is the fact that she passed away calmly without any tension before her health became so bad that her life quality would be unacceptable, she lived an amazing life full of love, care, cuddles, walks and attention.

1o7nxr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1o7nxr8/3_busy_days_in_paris/,3 busy days in Paris,"First, I just want to thank this community for all the incredibly helpful information as I planned our trip! It was invaluable and I just wanted to share our (admittedly intense) itinerary in case anyone would be interested.

I travelled with my 13 year old daughter as a special mother/daughter trip. We flew Jetblue BOS>CDG and it was great. Originally we had planned to be in Paris for 5 days, but due to bad weather forecasts in New England (US) and the govt shutdown, we ended up moving our flight home up by one day. Hindsight is 20/20, our original flight departed and arrived on time and I was so sad!

**Day 1:** Arrived in Paris (CDG) around 9.30am. Took the RER into the city, it was a bit crowded/confusing at the ticket machines but a very helpful French guide saved me from purchasing two one-way trips on a single card instead of two cards with a single one-way trip each. This covered the RER and transfer to the Metro to our hotel.

Dropped our bags off at the hotel (Hotel Bastille Speria, great central location, helpful staff, comfortable and clean rooms of a pretty generous size/updated bathrooms). Walked to Île Saint-Louis for a (fine) outdoor lunch at St Regis, then sat by the Seine soaking up sunshine until our 1.30 tickets to Notre Dame. Crowded but beautiful.

We  had time to kill before our check-in and I wanted to try to keep my daughter awake, so we went to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa on a weekday hoping crowds would be smaller. On the advice of this forum, I had purchased an Amis du Louvre so we didn't need tickets, could break up our visits across days, and used the special entrance (off Rivoli, directly to the Richeliu wing). Saw the Mona Lisa and the Denon statue room; crowds were still there but moved relatively quickly.

Walked back to our hotel, checked in and rested for an hour or so before dinner (L'Ange 20, it was fine but nothing crazy special... it was a short walk back to our hotel to fall asleep though!).

**Day 2:** We had 10.30 tickets to Musée de l'Orangerie but took a leisurely walk there after picking up pastries at a local boulangerie (and fantastic coffee at Jaco coffee - highly recommend, great staff and delicious pourover). My daughter loves Monet so she drank it all in - but we especially loved the Berthe Weill exhibit downstairs. Enjoyed lunch at a local creperie (Aux Ducs de Bourgogne) and decided to walk over to the Rodin (I bought tickets online as we walked) which was great. When we realized how close we were to Napoleon's tomb, we bought tickets for the Musée de l'Armée... Then walked back to the hotel and celebrated 24K steps with a delicious pasta dinner at East Mamma.

**Day 3:** Woke up to weather alerts and changed our flight. Back to the Louvre for the French statues and a visit to Napoleon's apartment. Then we walked to Jardin du Luxembourg for a picnic (picked up a delicious lunch at Le Parisien), and then visited Musée Curie. This was the only line we waited in the whole trip! Then we picked up Velib' bikes (bought 1 day passes on their website) and biked to the Eiffel Tower. Upgraded to ebikes and headed to the Arc de Triomphe (beware, lots of uphill on cobblestones) before biking back to our hotel. Cancelled dinner reservations at Los Güeros in favor of French food (L'Atelier Entrecôte & Volaille, meh but my daughter wanted steak frites). Unfortunately was not able to move our Sunday reservation at Juno to Saturday... 

**Day 4**: Treated ourselves to an early taxi to CDG (unfortunately no nearby boulangeries were open at 7am on a Sunday). Spent the next 24 hours constantly checking our original flight details and kicking myself for moving our flight up.

**tl;dr:**  
(1) Purchase an Amis du Louvre membership while you can to enable dip in/out visits through special entrance.  
(2) Definitely book dinner reservations in advance - the great places fill up, and without reservations its hard to avoid the tourist traps.  
(3) The city felt safe and clean to me, but we live in Boston and are used to being careful with our personal items.  
(4) We spent 4 months practicing our French on duolingo, it was well worth it - but usually folks switched to English at some point so we weren't fooling anyone.  
(5) If the weather is nice, walk or bike! Those moments were my favorites of the trip.

Instead of guessing, you’ll follow a meticulous process to dial in a perfectly balanced and delicious cup of coffee:

1. **Brew** \- Create a recipe with key variables like coffee dose, water amount, grind size, temperature, and brew time. These variables are dynamic and will change depending on what you taste.
2. **Taste** \- Sip and identify whether your cup leans sour (under-extracted), bitter (over-extracted) or balanced. Use the taste of your coffee as a northern star in your coffee brewing process is key!
3. **Tweak** \- Adjust your recipe by changing one variable at a time and aim for a balanced extraction. If your brew is balanced but bland, this is the time to tweak two variables in opposite directions!
4. **Repeat** \- Keep refining until you find you reach a sweet, balanced, and flavorful cup. With this process, you will be able to brew the best cup of coffee you can with your current setup, beans and skills!

The app is currently available on the Google Play Store and will in the near future hopefully be on the iOS store.

I’ve wondered if there are people who subconsciously pick up that we have ADHD and want to avoid us.

For example, one of my colleagues was talking to me about his most recent trip and I mentioned I had been there. I didn’t get super enthusiastic as I was at work and wanted to be calm and professional, so I masked. About a minute into the conversation I see his look change from engaged to terrified. It seemed like he was looking for an escape, and so I pretended like I caught a glimpse of the time and needed to call a client. I saw him at his desk look absolutely relieved. I just felt bad after that. Also at work are two women who sometimes look terrified or disgusted when I speak to them. All conversations are work-related.

For another example, my husband is trying to get me to be friends with his friend’s wife. As far as I’m aware, she’s NT. I haven’t spent one-on-one time with her, but when we’ve been in a group setting and I’m talking to her, she seems terrified. I’ve been very careful to not overshare, and I’m basically masking when I’m around her and her husband, but she has this look in her eyes where she wants me to just stop talking and leave.

I don’t actually think she likes me, but my husband brushes this off.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

Your mood (tired, focused, anxious, etc)

Your energy level

Time of day & weather

Your personal preferences

Other users

In order to train the AI to do this, I need to collect real user data from actual coffee drinkers, so I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could take a few minutes to fill out my survey. It is very easy, short, and completely anonymous, but it would help me so much!

You're welcome to submit multiple times! The more data I collect, the better the AI becomes. So if you've had 5 different coffees recently, please rate all 5 — every single rating makes a huge difference to my project.

It’s kind of impossible for me to give you a specific timeline. These are all generally in 2022/2023. These emails are between Rod and Gypsy. Rod is Gypsy’s father who was absent a majority of her life. His nickname for Gypsy is “Boo”. Gypsy is married to Ryan during this time frame. Gypsy brings up talking to a “practically married guy” ..I think she’s talking about a guy from Italy she talked to while in prison. She called him Jedi Master and he called her Padawan. He was engaged but him and his gf called it off, they were on and off for 8 years. HE stopped talking to Gypsy to work on his REAL relationship with his fiancé/girlfriend. I do notice it’s a pattern in Gypsy’s life that every time a man leaves her, she rewrites history that she left them first. Whether that’s to protect her insecure self and ego .. or maybe she doesn’t grasp reality.. I’m not sure. 


1.  Rod says to Gypsy, “apartment !! Wow thats good to hear. I'm sure you'll enjoy any place as long as you'll be together, it will be nice. As long as it's affordable and ya'll won't be stressing about money. I'm glad yall are doing good and are able to move past the episode. It's really hard to make any marriage work with a third party involved. The best thing is to look ahead and not back though. We all have regrets baby. It's ok to mess up. Thats what makes us grow up. The more pain the more we grow. I'm praying yall could make it through tough times with patience and determination to the promises yall made to each other. I'm excited for your apartment and I can't wait to go visit yall one day. We just left with the boat from Rhode Island to bring it back to Louisiana. Its a 9 day trip down around florida. Looking forward to some warmer weather…”


2.  Gypsy says to Rod, “I talked to —someone— yesterday and she said that they are thinking about a possible air date for the documentary on March 27th but it isn't set in stone. It will be a weekly show so it’s unknown though if they will air episodes 1and2 together or space it out like the rest. They asked Ryan to do a little more filming, just some simple stuff. Episodes 123 are finished and working on 456 now. I'm ready to see the finished project and be done with it lol. :-P I asked when we might see a trailer on TV and I think they wanna get that out pretty soon actually. My stomach is in knots lol I just hope people are kind to all of us and I should let you know I may end up pissing off the Pitre side with some of my opinions but I'm sharing my truth. It will be interesting to say the least. I am greatful that Ryan is really down to earth about all this. I don't think he realizes he may end up becoming well known to the public by default of being my husband. He is calm about it, public opinion doesn't nor has it ever phased him.” 


3.  Gypsy says to Rod, “Hi Dad, Today it snowed and temps have been so freak'n cold! Watching the snow fall makes me a little sad. Maybe I am just in a depression. I woke up missing Ryan so much. I received the divorce paperwork to fill out, but with how I'm feeling...I just don't know. He always kept me smiling and happy. Now even my friends look at me and tell me how sad I look all the time.”, Gypsy also says to him, “I'm hanging in there, I just want to be home. I wanted to ask since I'll be living at home would you like me to pay rent? I can help with food and services like internet and such. I don't want to just be there and not help in some way. I am in a state of numbness when it comes to Ryan. I just want to get passed this. I feel like this next year I just want to work on myself and then get out and enjoy being free. I will set a goal for myself. 2 years of being single and if I do happen to start seeing someone, if I can sustain a happy healthy relationship for 3+ years then I'll consider marriage. But I had to do this to learn from it. —Someone— told me she broke up with Andre. We kinda made a pact to stay single for a year lol I'll keep my end. I love you too. Talk soon.”, Rod says, “lol No Rent. Don't be silly!! No need to pay rent or food. Just pick up after yourself and pull ya weight. Thanks for offering. Yea stay single and work on the New Gypsy that's about take on the world. You'll want to have no ties or obligations when you walk out so you can really test some waters for a lil bit. I am glad you've made a decision with Ryan and I'm sorry you feel numb but try to think of the possibility of you being really happy one day with someone that really lights your fire. Don't settle on the idea of being married and happy. It will come and you'll know for sure. Make ya checklist now for what you expect from a guy and how you think he should make you feel. Sex isn't everything in a marriage but I promise you if there isn't any sparks flying for those 1st couple years then you'll turn into a cold ass bitch in a year or 2 and nobody will be happy. Next would some natural traits like maybe being funny or gentle or strong or shy or weird. Then his situation/status. His family, his children, ex wife or baggage you will have no choice but to accept and deal with. I think if you prioritize in that order then that would be your best chance at having a successful relationships. You know all this though right? Yes I know you do. Your just to soft to let go of someone who treats you kindly. I know I made that mistake with your mother. Believe me I know. Its ok though, you realized it and decided to live for YOU !! Anyways I love you and…”


4.  Gypsy says to Rod, “I think when it comes to intimacy, I believe Ryan tries too hard to be sexy and appealing and it comes off pervy at times lol but when he isn't trying THAT is when I want that physical intimacy with HIM. I believe it all has to do with his level of self confidence and me responding to that. I won't know how we are in that area until we can spend time together upon release. That is why it is so important that me and him have at least 2 days in the cabin alone after y'all leave to head home. We need that in person connection in what could be a mini honeymoon. That spark is there we just need to throw some gasoline on that baby and let the night burn. lol are you still at work?” 


5.  Rod says to Gypsy, “they always will.
Thats what a good partner does. Stays strong until their spouse can catch up. Sometimes its day weeks and years. You both have extremely difficult challenges ahead. Ryan is a sweet guy, I like him alot and believe he will do whatever he can not to lose you. I don't think he'll intentionally hurt you and thats a great thing. I believe he'll be able to provide for you and keep you safe as well. I'm just scared he won't be able to fill you your intimacy needs baby. Thats kinda a big deal too. The good thing, well not a good thing but an advantage to this is ya'll have some time before that department needs to be addressed. It's important that you tell him this so he can allow you the space to explore that part of your self and find a way to feel fulfilled while remaining true to your vows. That's a challenge but if he loves you then he'll give you the space. It was missing between your mom n I and even though I messed around on her, I still couldn't remain true to her in my heart because that intimacy really helps build that strong bond and love that develops in marriage. I left because I knew I was cutting myself short and settling just because it was the right thing to do by her. Instead of being honest with her when she told me she was pregnant. I was weak and didn't have the courage to think about my happiness and how ! wouldn't be happy and begin resenting her and stuff. You don't have to settle, you don't owe any friends or family your loyalty just because they've been there for you. They can remain in your circle of trust but you don't have to feel obligated in any way to commit yourself until you want to. You need to feel like you absolutely cannot live without your husband, partner or whatever you commit to. If you don't have that feeling the just shut the shit down and understand that it will come one day. You can't force it, dream it or say its so. You gotta feel it it in your soul baby. It's absolutely unmistakable. I hope you can dig deep and understand what your heart really desires. I will pray for you to find peace baby. You will never forget the ones you've loved. I still dream about my 1st love from from grade grade years ago). Lol. I love you Dad” 


6.  Gypsy says to Rod, “I had remembered a faded memory from when I was very little maybe 5, mom had a friend named Mark. He liked her and he fixed a room at his place for her and I. I didn't like him and so I spit on him. I only wanted you and mom to get back together and I was not happy with any guy that liked her otherwise. I sometimes feel like I deserved what happened because I guess if I wasn't happy with her being with another man and you moved on with Kristy then she felt I was stopping her from having a life with anyone else so her focus was on me” 


7.  Gypsy says to Rod, “Dad, I was placed in segregation aka ""the hole"" on the morning of the 18th and have not been able to use the phone or email, I was released today. I am NOT in trouble, The reason was I was under investigation, however it was not revealed to me over what. Rumors flew around camp that it was about a visit, Which I did have a visit the week prior with Ryan but nothing out of the ordinary happened to give cause for me to go to the hole, so I was extremely confused. I'm hearing so many remors from other inmates that said what they thought it was over. Some said it was the stranger who got on my visitors list and brought a package, others have said it was about drugs, others said I grabbed Ryan in a sexual manner during the visit. Which I know it wasn't drugs or that grabbed him, and if someone came to visit me and brought a package I wasn't aware of it. I have 3 people who I don't know on my visitors list because the caseworker doesn't ask me if I know the person who sends the application, he just approves the person who applied if they pass a background check. I will be taking care of that on Monday by removing those people off my visitors list. The whole thing was so crazy, they kept me in the hole for 2 weeks and then cleared me of the investigation and let me go back to general population without any violation or fault. I'm shaken up because I'm like I would like to know why I was under investigation instead of just hearing idle gossip from other inmates. Anyways, I love you and I'm drinking coffee watching TV happy to be out of the hole. :-) Btw I see the parole board December 9th, I got the exact date last week. :-) miss you love you” 


8.  Gypsy says to Rod, “ I'm I'll always be here to listen. I'm no one to judge, or preach. Earlier this year I was talking to a practically married guy and cut it off because I didn't feel it was right. He was super hot too but I knew it was never going to lead anywhere. Just like you I get a lot of attention and not all of it feels right. that's why we have each other to talk about these things. I know you didn't wanna put me in the mix but I'm always here for you too ya know. :-) love u 2” ",6,1760563196.0,GRBSnarkBU,6,1.0,False

1o7nhue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7nhue,"Took two sealed jars of starter out of the fridge after MANY months, need some wisdom","From what I’ve read and seen I’m very weary of the jar with the pink tinged hooch, despite it smelling normal to me (sweet, alcohol, yeast), but I included those photos in case anyone wants to convince me it’s not dangerous 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

What I really would like to know is what on earth happened with my smaller mason jar?? This was discard that I saved so it’s even older than the pink jar, and it was extremely difficult unscrew. When I finally loosened it, the lid came right off with the ring - they were not stuck together, but almost every other time I’ve opened a mason jar the lid has to be pried off the jar, so it raised a red flag for me. There is no black in the jar of discard itself (I looked closely, just small air pockets), and it just smells like yeast to me (no hooch even), so I’m hoping it may be rust? It does not seem to have the characteristics of mold to me, the texture reminds me of coffee grounds. Please advise! 🫶🏼

personally i like tracking it as small wins against bills or essentials. that way it is genuinely adding to my savings instead of disappearing into extra spending

There is no official sign that would read “The Slums”, but it might as well be one, for the change between the government-supported parts of Fayium and those where old breeds established their own closed community, is stark.

Pavement is broken and never repaired. Rusted barbed wire weaves through fences. Stray cats, so skeletal that they don’t make Kezef’s eyes dilate in either adoration or hunger, prowl about in search of scarce food.

More windows boarded up. No new shop signs, fewer electrocars, even though the flat roofs are still fully covered in the dark-blue scales of solar panels. Before I had been moved to Egypt, I never saw shacks and huts that were more solar panel than house. After all, it was never a popular energy source in the Arctic.

The decay around us is more evident than in the bazaar are. More haunting. The wake of destruction without the patches that downtown tries to present as signs of revival.

“What’s your [poison], Terran Luka?” Kezef inquires as we walk down a narrow street, shoulder-rubbing the stucco-covered houses.

”Huh?”

She exhales noisily through her slit-like nostrils, exasperated by my daftness. 

“[Obsession]. Hobby, that is? You have one, don’t you? I heard Terrans like physical activity - your [sports], and much more. A collection? Maybe religion?”

Not going to lie, the question puts me in a stupor for a second. I kicked a piece of loose pavement in thought. 

Hobby, *right*. Did I have one? I wasn’t one for the arts, that became evident due to the rare activities of the sort we had back at the orphanage.

No penchant for drawing, like Kezef. Music? Don’t know how to play any instrument, and my voice isn’t cut out for singing. Even can’t say I have some outstanding taste in kusic. 

One of the cadets in our unit at Arctic Base 1, Stephan, was a real meloman. Despite a cap on personal belongings, he managed to smuggle in a whole digital storage device filled with all sorts of tunes curated by himself, which he’d talk about incessantly, but I… I like the things I think everyone likes. 
The marches, and the Remembrance songs, and the aggro-pop - but I never go out of my way to find anything outside what they’d play on the radio. Music’s just… background.

Religion? Don’t get how anyone would believe in a god after what had happened.

Then, my physique made me undesirable for most team sports the other guys played during training. As explained by the coaches, I introduced too big of an advantage for the team I was on, so all I got was watch the rest from the bleachers, and it became old really fast.

Hm. I really came to love reading, after professor Tahar finally had taught me, but otherwise…

“Games”, I announce after about fifty meters of silence. “I like strategy board games. Chess, checkers, goh specifically.”

“What are those?” Kezef’s eyes spark up with curiosity for a moment, but then she spots an old-breed couple emerging from a small hut and adjusts her veil.

“Games that emulate… well, hm, come to think of it, *war*”, I say. “One of the few activities encouraged during our training. But they’re very abstract. Usually there’s a… uh, a wooden board of some kind, and pieces, from wood or stone. or paper. And two players. Usually. But now it’s all in our holopads.”

I pat the large pocket on my thigh.

“So, it’s like an abstract hunt? Where your opponent is the prey and you - his?”

“I guess?”

“Are you good at it?”

“Do I have to be?” I chuckle, but then, glancing at Kezef, notice her intensely expectant stare. “Oh, you’re serious! Well, these games *can* be competitive. I play just for the fun of it, if the opponents are good. You’re supposed to know all sorts of fancy combinations and tactics for chess, but I just play by intuition.”

“Like a hatchling, then”, she drawls with an air of disappointment. I can only shrug at that.

Not going to tell her that I didn’t care. It wasn’t about winning or even being good at it. Chess, goh… they just demand undivided attention, stripping me of an ability to think about *other* things. Plus, it’s always nice to have a problem put before you that you can immediately and clearly solve.

An illusion of control. One so welcome these days. 

”But I get it. We have *arnok*, this “chess” sounds similar to it. It is highborn [poison], expensive. Pilots and military are encouraged to play”, her tongue flicks in a pattern I’ve come to associate with bitterness and frustration. “You know, Terran Luka, talking to you I come to understand that terrans are quite focused on war. No wonder Hunter-Communicator Shuzet speaks so highly of humanity - as a military, that is.”

That bit about Shuzet appraising humanity should’ve caught more of my attention, but for some reason, I decide I hear an indictment of humanity and bristle in reply.

“And the Arxur aren’t focused?” Kezef seems to catch my defensiveness and opens her maw, waiting for me to finish. “Your fleets alone…”

“Oh, we are. It is, indeed, strange, this similarity. You have no tails, no scales, you eat cattle-feed if you want… so unlike Arxur. But your blood is red like ours and your history, hm-mm”, she rumbles and in a very human-like gesture scratches the very tip of her snout with an index claw. “Very close to ours. Wars between people, often devastating ones… and yet both our kinds manage to rise from the ashes. What were the chances of that?”

“Slim”, I say.

***

Chatting like that, we get to the provided address. The old breeds we encounter by the way keep out of our way for the most part, save for the hostile glares and under-breath curses, but I can deal with that.

Al-Samkari, 12 is a large, grand house, and Kezef’s interviewees occupy an apartment on the second floor. Before entering, we stop to admire it. It’s not just a Pre-Glassing building, but even a pre-21st century one, standing proud and tall amidst the decay. 
All sorts of decorative details, even mosaics, cover it, though the majority are damaged beyond recognition.

It contains a large inner courtyard, which we cross before entering one of the wings to get to the second floor. Women wash clothes in the fountain at the center of the courtyard, some children play with a puppy on the dirty tile… Murmurs follow us, but quickly die out when we vanish into the building.

The pair of people that greets us are old and frail. In their 70’s, if I had to guess. Must’ve witnessed the Glassing at the prime of their lives. They’re polite enough for old-breeds, and even offer me some coffee. 

At first they’re reserved around Kezef, eyes attentive to her every move, but bit by bit, she opens them up. Translator implants are switched off, and her work begins.

As for me, they pointedly pay me no attention after the bitter, black coffee is served. I pay them with the same creds. Position myself near the window and watch the courtyard below, hand on the HPP’s holster.

People come and go. A dog runs in looking for its puppy, barks, the children chase after it.

Come and go.

Come and go.


****

About half an hour into the interview, I turn my head to Kezef and the old-breeds.

“[Wordweaver. We have to get going]”, I hiss in Arxuri, eyes never leaving the two old-breeds. Upon hearing me speak to her, they huddle closer and stare at me like I’ve grown a third arm.

The sounds coming out of my throat are inhuman and they don’t understand. I measure them up and decide that I don’t own any explanations. It’s Kezef that I’m worried about.

She’s my responsibility, not the comfort of their feeling.

The Arxur’s head turns an almost 180 degrees towards me without her body barely moving, a benefit of that long, muscular neck. Her snot scrunches slightly from irritation.

“But I’m not finished, Terran Luka. The phonems…”

“Doesn’t matter. We move - now.”

I try to keep the alarm out of my tone while being stern enough to snip any arguments in the bud. 

No need for premature panic, plus I can’t waste time explaining to her that in the last five minutes around thirty people squeezed themselves into the courtyard, trickling in like roaches attracted to food.

That I saw several of them point into the direction of the second floor walkway.

That some of them carried sticks. Pipes. Baseball bats.

The brewing trouble permeates the air like stormborn electricity. I can taste the ozone, the burn between us all. I quickly pop my head out of the window one last time to scan the small crowd below for a sign of firearms… and thankfully, there’s none.

”What’s the matter-?” Kezef begins to ask as I shove her out of the door and close it behind us so fast I nearly snip the tip of her tail. She grabs it and glowers at me accusingly, prompting me to sigh.

“There’s people outside. Have a feeling they’re here for us”, I clip through clenched teeth and grab her by the scaly elbow to cross the stairwell’s landing and onto the staircase itself.

Pull out the HPP and keep it trained on the lower floor as we slowly descend.

Her eyes widen when she sees the weapon, pupils constricting into obsidian cracks which run through vibrant jade of the irises. 

I activate the commlink with a free finger.

“Abaurre, that you?”, Navin’s voice crackles through the spotty cellular coverage.

“Navin, I got a potential Code P. Need drones on my location, teargas-equipped or microwave, ASAP. Confirm?”

There’s a stunned pause on the other line. We’re on the first floor’s foyer now, Kezef’s claws clicking on the tiles to add to the tension I’m feeling. *Click-click-click*. An apartment door to my right opens up to reveal a sliver of a face and a worried dark eye, and I slightly move the gun in its direction. The door closes immediately.

”Confirm, but… Code P, what the fuck… how?! Old breeds?!”

“Believe me, I don’t have time to explain. Alert Mahler, he knows how to respond - just get the drones here!”

Before opening the entrance door, I hesitate. Maybe we should stay? It’s thin and wooden, a privacy screen rather than an obstacle. We could’ve holed up inside the building, waited for the drones to arrive and disperse the crowd, however there’s nothing here that would prevent people barging in here… and in the tight space of the foyer and stairs our situation would become even more precarious.

So, I push the door open, gun at ready. For the moment the outside light overloads my vision and I squint, despite us being still covered by the shade of the cantilevered second floor above us.

They’re waiting for us. 

The courtyard is packed and eerily silent, so much so that the faulty fountain gurgling at the center of the shallow pool sounds like a damn waterfall.

But the moment we exit, everything comes into motion. Silence breaks with murmurs, curses, shuffling. 

Yelps of surprise and terror ripple through the gathered people, and a few stagger back upon seeing me and the Arxur. The gun in my hand, even when not trained at them, prompts more insults and indignant “boos” hurled towards us.  

I stop mid-step and Kezef does so too, her claws firmly wrapped around my belt, twitching. Giving away her emotions, the tail slaps and lashes against the ground.

It feels unreal. Like a mirage in this oppressive heat, but no matter how much I blink, it won’t go away. 

Thirty people, give or take. 

Mostly adults, though I notice a few younger, thinner figures among them. 

Mostly men. Fists balled and some squeezing makeshift weapons. I spot a crowbar… a sort of pipe or metal tubing… One of the kids juggles a piece of pavement. 

They don’t hide their intentions. My mouth goes drier than the Sahara desert.

The closest men to me must be the ring-leaders. The firestarters. I try to focus on them, yet find nothing but banality of the typical old-breed fare. To an eye accustomed to New Breed purposefulness, these people feel like half-formed, melting wax sculptures - with pot bellies and bald sports, bad shaves, dusty clothes and postures warped by poor nutrition and stress, galore. 

They reek of poverty, of desperation. Of resentment and moldy, stale bitterness. Such people should’ve stayed with their wives and children back home, not try and…
 
I know that people find me intimidating. Even *repulsive* in some ways, after the serum had me fully grow into my genetic potential. 

Back at Arctic Base One, our class’s instructing officer, Sergeant Kwon, would often use me as a sparring “dummy” for the rest of the recruits - just because I was taller, bigger and, presumably, stronger. 
A perfect tool for fresh neohuman soldiers to test their capabilities against. And boy did they absolutely *not* want to get in the ring with me, not from the get-go, at least.

If that was the sentiment of newly-made atrox, then these commoners should fear me even more. At least, *respect* my strength and authority..

So when I take a step forward, the crowd, even the old losers and acne-ridden youths at the forefront, recoils some. 

Hope lights up in my chest. We may yet skim tragedy, but…

No. After faltering, they step up again to meet me. Someone grins, teeth yellowed by coffee and crooked under a thin strip of a moustache. Rebars and two-by-fours slap open palms. 

We humans are pack hunters, didn’t I tell that to Kezef? Well, here’s thre front row to that statement. You can be all the lion you want, but when you’re alone with hyenas…

Their fear of me is tempered by their numbers. 

”Terran Luka…” a claw scrapes at my back while a tail wraps around my boot, clearly seeking comfort and protection. My chest tightens. I hope I can give that to her. I *must*. “What do these people want, what’s the problem?

“[Quiet. Not now].”

“What is the matter?” I clear my throat and growl, in a demanding and, hopefully, confident tone. The echo bounces off faintly off the old stone. “We are representatives of the United Dominion, Terran Command and the Arxurian Office of Alignment! Move aside.”

The ranks break and a man steps forward together with four others. They’re different. Not as “accidental” as the rest. The eyes of one in particular - a grubby but still stout Arab in a patched-up jumpsuit with a faded “Adidas” on the chest - are hard, dark with unrestrained hatred. Unwavering from me and Kezef with an iron-sight focus. Former military?

“Well, well… Looks like you ghouls shed the last pretense of politeness,” he says, the translator implant decoding his speech with a lag, allowing me to hear his barking tone. “Barging in our home like you own it, dragging a disgusting alien with you!”

“Yeah, right!”

“This isn’t a zoo, habibi!”

”Get out, get out!”

”Ghuls not welcome, have you seen the sign?”

The crowd hollers. I feel the growing electricity, the static charge being generated, with my skin. 

They came for blood. They *want* blood.

And that’s the reason why I cannot play this game. Not with Kezef here. One thing is if they tried to jump me, or attack the security at the Office, like they did during the protests, but Kezef is a variable that messess up any strategy.

My racing mind combs through all the anti-riot and sensitivity training that we’ve got, but comes up empty. All I know is that I can’t let them make me hurt them, because if I do… all hell breaks loose, for the Office of Alignment, for Terran Command.

A chasm of regret opens up in my stomach. Why? *Why why why?!* Why I had to agree to Kezef’s… and speaking of whom! I find her with my peripheral vision, the bit of the snout poking from behind my shoulder. Mouth lightly agape and quivering tongue flicking in and out so fast I can barely see it.

Can she taste it? The pheromones of loathing that human bodies can generate?

“We are here on official United Dominion business. Let us through. Immediately.”

“And what business that’d be?” Another man, thin and lanky, steps forward and spits through the large gap between his two front teeth. Nods at my gun and leers. “What, you kafirs finally found your fake spines and decided to settle the “old breed problem”?

It’s idiotic, and he knows it. But they, of course, are obsessed with the idea that we atrox wish to displace and kill all of the old-breeds, either openly or through the serum. 

It’s one of the most persistent and popular theories, one around which a lot of the Old Breed communities revolve.

It’s not the first time I’m hearing it. I snarl in reply.

“No, but that would be the case if you-…”

The ringleader, this “ex-military” turns towards the crowd, hands raised theatrically, drawing attention to himself. His oily tone betrays the immense satisfaction that the bastard is deriving from all this.

“This is what I’m talking about, dear neighbors! No reverence, no tact, no *soul*! We had to survive through fire, brimstone, flood and plague… and this is how we are repaid? Aliens in our street, soulless ghuls bossing us around, taking our food, treating us like dirt? And we’re asked, no - obliged! - to tolerate it! In the name of what? Unity? Pha!”

When I hear the chorus of resounding howls, my heart sinks into my soles. 
No, no - it actually bounces back up, beating so fast and hard that I’m afraid to look down, expecting it to pound right against my skin.

We’re trapped. *Trapped*. This is no game of chess, no wooden figures knocked down if someone makes a wrong move. It’s *us* that would be swept off the board. Options? Fight or flight, but neither is feasible… Not with Kezef, no!

”Paving way for your reptile lords to grab our land, ruin our homes, whatever remains of our lives? What does this lizard pay you, shaitan, to do its bidding, huh?”

A young boy in a dirty wifebeater brandishes a rusty rebar in their hand and makes a mock jab in our direction.

“We’re not getting needled, you GMO fuck!”

“They want to build that plant to feed even more of them cursed aliens!”

I glare at them, hoping that my stature and visage is enough to discourage them from any physical hostility. Beyond my will, my lips curl up, exposing the fangs and making me feel as if I'm a cornered dog. 

“Look, look! That’s the shaitan coming out of it!”

This is so bad. It’s worse and getting worse by every passing second that they creep closer, flanking and squeezing the trap shut. 

My brain overheats trying to see if we can dart to the side, to the other corner of the courtyard, but I have no idea how ready Kezef is for something like this. If she even is a fighter?

They surely want to drag me into an argument, provoke me… and justify the subsequent violence if I do something first. Someone flips out a portable terminal and starts recording, no doubt waiting for me or Kezef to snap. 

The HPP  in my hand feels like a shield. A faulty, unreliable one.  Even as I raise it some to show that there’s no reluctance in me to shoot, I have no idea if I can plant a bullet right into someone’s head or body like that. It’s all surreal. I was trained to shoot at *aliens*, not fellow humans.

Again, a mirage, a fever dream - no, nightmare - that I can’t throw off and wake up.

It's not about religion, it's not about politics. It's about… they just need to feel power over something. Without claws, without fangs, they're reclaiming a lost status of a predator.

And we are… prey?

“We. Are here. On United. Dominion. Business”, I squeeze out between clenched teeth. Punctuate my words with subtle shifts to the gun’s barrel. “Even if you are not neohumans, you are still citizens of the United Dominion, and are subject to its laws. As security personnel to the Office of Alignment, I have the authority to order you to. Stand. *Down*!” 

“Neohumans… Quite a name for god-forsaken filth! Think it makes you better than us?!” a woman to the right of me lowers her headscarf veil and spits on the ground loudly. “You’re not! You’re a mistake made in a lab! You’re a taint on mankind, shaitan!”

“You can order us nothing!” someone screams shrilly.

“I don’t wish to argue. We will be out of your face if you just let us through!”

“Like it’s that easy”, retorts a ragged, graying man to my left. His grin is borderline insane as his gaze shifts between me and Kezef as he cowers behind my back. He shuffles closer, hands in pockets. “You’ve already disturbed our peace!” 

“If you move just a meter closer, I’ll shoot!”

“Go on, ghul, make us martyrs”, another one of the ring-leaders squacks through rotting teeth, all while juggling a small knife. “We don’t take orders from alien scum and their lackeys. Seen those bones at the administration? Say something dumb again, see where you end up!”

Kezef’s breathing quickens behind me and her tail squeezes my foot harder.

”[Luka]”, she hisses, and from the fact that she’d dropped the formal “Terran”, plus the sharp inhale before the name, I understand that she’s panicking. “[Luka, why don’t they let us go?]”

I try not to show it, but dread overwhelms me. The gun’s handle is slippery with sweat and my hands grow numb. I grip it harder, claws digging into skin, as if it’s a lifeline that one can hold onto.

It does nothing. This horrid, sickly numbness spreads through my whole body, turning limbs into unresponsive mush, making the bladder full. I have to admit it - I’m *terrified*. 

I’m terrified out of my damned mind.

If I shoot them, there’s no going back, the damage to the Office here in Fayium, to Old Breed relations, would be immense. I can’t imagine the riots that would follow. 

But if I don’t do something, I risk Kezef’s health. Even, as unimaginable as it is, life. 

No. *No*. I can’t let her down. I just can’t. Not someone so kind, so full of curiosity, someone who had *trusted* me to protect them, despite the differences of species… and everything else! I simply can’t!

To hell with protocol! If these are murderous thugs, who the fuck cares what trouble they brought upon themselves by assaulting United Dominion reps? I’d be vindicated 100% for self-defense!

Finding this anchor, I half-turn to her. 

“[They want to hurt us. Kezef, keep behind me at all times, we’ll have to force ourselves through them. Can you do that?]”

Her jade-green eyes turn almost black as the pupils expand from fear. Panicked fast tongue flicks follow, but she quickly regains her faculties and nods.

“[Yes. Yes, I think I can].

And then I hear it, by the grace of serum-enhanced audial perception. The “ex-soldier” throws it quietly to another man nearby, one whose face is hidden behind a kuffiya wrap, but whose eyes burn darkly above it with contempt and determination.

”You grab the lizard, we’ll take care of the ghul.”

Those few words, said so nonchalantly, seal the deal. Make everything simple. 

*I’ll kill each and every one of them if they lay a single finger on her.*

Gunfire claps thunderously above our heads as I point the HPP up and squeeze the trigger.

Fire off one, two, three… four times. The crowd screams… scatters some, loses its density. A woman falls on her back as she scrambles away too quickly and trips over her own flip-flops. Good! Chaos, stampede - and we’ll slink away in the mess! 

“Back off!” I roar as I immediately bring the gun up to aim at them openly. “Back the *fuck off”, of I’ll swear I’ll kill every-…”

But before I can finish the threat, something *explodes* off the right side of my face. The world around me shakes violently, forcing me to stagger to find my shaken footing. Vision floods with light first, then pain spikes and spreads through the back of my head, the jaw… the electrical jolt of agony stretching the old-breed’s excited hollering into distorted baselines.

But before I understand that I’ve been hit - with a thrown rock or a piece of pavement - it happens again. My head snaps, the skin on my templs splits, something warm splashes over my ear, but I still see - I see them run towards us. 

It’s not over.

Shaken and disoriented, head still ringing, vision blurred from the hit, I fall back on trained-in automatism. 

In a fraction of a second I grab Kezef with my left hand and fire off the remaining five rounds to the side, dumping the mag so that if the fuckers take my gun, they won’t able to shoot me with it. Drop it.

”[On the ground!]” I command Kezef and in a smooth, swift motion push her to the ground, belly-down, to then pile over on her. I cover her with my body, tucking the trembling form underneath me in a desperate bid to not let even a centimeter of her stick out.

Her dry, warm snout presses into my chin as I curl around her tightly and try to squeeze my head into the shoulders for some protection.

I barely make it in time, because the violence doesn’t wait to come crashing on me, on. 

And when it does, it’s a snowcrash of blows. I’m heavy, hard to dislodge, so they kick me in a maddened frenzy, over and over, screaming and laughing as they do. 

Boots stomp on my back, find a way under the ribs and into where there’s a bit of the Arxr to be seen. Two-by-fours join in, then the heavy slap of something metal on the bulletproof vest, then my arms and thighs, where there’s no protection.

“[Stay, stay!] I plead to Kezef as I feel her squirm in panic underneath me.

Every jab, every blow reverberates not only with pain, but the hatred with which it’s delivered. They shout, elated, drunken with violence - while I can only grit my teeth and bear it, eyes squeezed shut. 

Someone’s shoe or boot connects with my skull a few times, jostling my poor brain, the sharp edges of the soles scraping the skin of my scalp as the cap I’ve been wearing is knocked off.

There’s no other thought present, but about Kezef. She’s wracked with spasmic crying hisses and I clutch her tighter to myself, claws digging in the dry soil. 

*I can take it! I can for Kezef. I’m big and tough, the vest protects, the drones will be here soon.*

But I’m proven wrong at the exact moment. Suddenly, a sharp, truly *sharp* and *dangerous* pain manifests in my side. Cold and biting, it penetrates far, right between my lower ribs. As someone screams, cursing, and then *tugs* so that I feel the steel twist between bones, I realize I’ve been stabbed.

And the blade stuck.

I jerk my head up, gasping for air through the pain, and am immediately punished for it. 

Before I can even understand what’s happening, the world shatters, bursts into shards of white and red. It’s like a flashbang does off in my head, a horrible pressure that’s released with a bone-crunching *pop*! 

My head is violently whipped aside, face and jaw on fire and then enveloped in sickly wet warmth.

Now my mouth is full of liquid and loose rocks… my teeth? Cracking an eye open for a second, I see the business end of a bat right by my face, several nails driven through the wood. Bloodied. A bit of something that looks like skin caught on one of the nails’ ends.

Part of me that remains an indifferent spectator to it all, points out that if that thing hits me again, atrox or not, I’m going down. 

I drown in the salty liquid in my mouth, choke on it. Something is wrong in how my jaw works, and…

I have to do something about this. But Kezef?

The ground feels nice. I guess, I’m just tired… *it’s funny, really. All this training, all the testing to see how good of supersoldiers we’d make, and I’ll die not fighting some genocidal chickens, avenging my family, but being shanked by some Egyptian hicks…*

As I’m ready to be swallowed by the ground and darkness, Kezef screeches. 

It’s not a human scream - a high-pitched growl instead, brittle from hurt and betrayal.

“[My tail!]”

That yelp of pain in an instant breaks something in my mind. Obliterates all other thoughts. Removes the growing weight from my limbs.

A storm of an all-encompassing fury rips through my every limb, setting every nerve fiber ablaze until I find myself on my feet again. 

The bat-wielding old-breed right beside me doesn’t expect it. 

My body moves on its own. One hand stretches out to grab the scrawny man by the collar… only it’s the claws on my hand that meet him first - slicing through the shirt, the skin, the meat until they hook into the ribcage itself to hoist him up in the air - and the other grabs his flailing arm by the bicep.

The bat drops from the old-breed’s grip.

He’s so *light*. Struggling, crying, so scared… of what, that I’ll hurt him?

*I’ll hurt him*, so I just pull on his arm, it seems right. Harder and harder, relentlessly. 

Muscles and tendons resist, but that’s not nearly enough for hurting Kezef, for threatening her life. I pull and pull, until something snaps and detaches with a disgusting crunching, moist sound. Yes, that’s good.

I shake him off the claws and, convulsing, he falls to the ground, his face a screaming mask of horror. The arm remains in my grip. 

It feels unreal, like I’m holding a plastic prop. So I drop it. 
My head isn’t on right. I don’t even hear anything, but some faint, muffled noises that come from behind a mile of cottonwool mushed into my ears. 

I discard the clammy piece of flesh. 

Then turn around to see the “ex-military”-type just gaping at me. *Below* me, completely frozen like soon-to-be-roadkill in the headlights. The stench of fear, one I’ve heard Arxur talk about, is spilled through the air - or did his bladder just give out?

I kick him between the legs, pistoning my foot into the groin. The reverberation of the hipbone cracking travels up my leg and the old-breed doesn’t just crumple - he’s blown away, skidding into the dust like a broken doll a couple of meters in the dust.

Another shadow twitches to my side, and in one heartbeat I’m somehow near it, wrapping my whole hand around its small head to then smash it into my knee. 
Teeth and pieces of jawbone pierce the fabric of my pants and then the skin just from the impact’s sheer force, but pain is far, far away by this point, just like sound… and higher reasoning. 

The body slumps, and I don’t catch its fall, because the other old-breeds are still just an arm’s reach, a leap away. Too *slow*. Too slow to run, when they were so quick to dole out “justice”.

So they become mere flesh under my claws. Screeching and weeping flesh, ripe for goring, kicking, punching, breaking apart. Twenty two years of locked-down anguish spills out of me, out of my cracked skull, with nothing to hold it back.

The air of the courtyard is like ice on my exposed gums and the mess of my face as I dart between the scrambling old-breeds.  

It’s easy. I catch them by an arm or a leg as they sluggishly try to escape my wrath, moving as if underwater. *Who’s the hunter now?*. Sometimes the limb breaks. Sometimes it doesn’t. My hands come back washed in blood all the same.

There’s nothing coming out of my throat. No threats, no growls. I just come after them, fast and inevitably, to throw, or punch or claw at - any of these is enough to stop their screaming… movement… aggression.

Only *my* aggression is left.

In one lunge I reach a straggler, a woman, and grabbing her by the scruff of her dress, lift her to my eye level - see the tears in her eyes - and then pound her face-first into the pool. 

Water and blood splash up, but then I’m suddenly on the other side of the courtyard swiping with open-handed claws against someone’s naked back. The man falls away like a dry leaf blown by wind, the air misting with blood, while I pick up a smaller youth and launch him into the nearby wall.

Somehow, through this blood fog a sudden clarity emerges, if for a second. A staggering realization that *this* is what I was made for.

For enemies to look at me in terror when they dare threaten our present and our future.

But, there’s not many enemies left. Bodies, yes. The rest of the old-breeds though… A couple vanish into the building itself, someone tries to climb over the gate. Falls down.

I want to continue the pursuit, rip that door off the hinges, but for some reason air just stops filling my lungs.

And I need air, for *fuck’s sake*! The next moment I find myself on my knees. Reach to my left side and jerk my hand away when it bumps into something sticking out of  the vest.

Right! The knife. Better leave it there.

Wiping a blood-soaked hand against my eyes to clear the vision, I turn back to Kezef. Try to breathe a sigh of relief when I see her propped on the elbow, cradling her tail, whole and *safe* and looking at me with eyes wide open… but instead gasp, choke and spit up the annoying bloody pebbles in my mouth. 

I can’t resist picking one up to examine it, however notice that Kezef is shouting at me, pointing to the sky with an index claw.

What? What’s there… *where’s the fucking air*… lungs burning…

A gas canister falls a few meters away from me, disgorging smoke. Then another. *Mahler’s drones*. Have to pick it up. Can’t have the teargas get to her. Have to stand up.

Have to…

Feeling devastated and slightly happy at the same time,"I’m an 23M and I lost my childhood dog a few days ago. I had her since I was 9. A beautiful westie. She passed as at almost 14 years old. 

The last 5 months of her life she started showing her age. She started walking with difficulty, and slowly she became totally unable of walking or standing. She had lung cancer and, while she took medication and her cancer almost disappeared, she had a few problems with breathing every now and then. She still had a decent life quality, that’s way we waited for her to pass away and we didn’t put her down. The past few months I constantly go to walks with her holding her, used to give her her favourite snacks, used to play gently with her toys. She was looking at every car, person or dog that passed (her neck was functional), she used to enjoy food and water. 

She passed away at my fathers arms while they were at the vet. Calmly, without any pain or even making a noise. She had a sudden heart arrest. The day before I took her at a car drive and she was looking at my eyes and the window, lying down at my chest. 

She is the reason I am who I am today. The unconditional love she gave me through my childhood, my teenage years and my early adulthood literally shaped me into a better version of myself

I did the best I could to give her a great life. During all those years I used to travel with her, go for walks or coffees with my friends in places I could include her, sleep with her in my arms, have her by my side in almost every part of my day, go for walks in big parks with other dogs in order to socialise. I cancelled my job for 2 months in order to be with her during her last months and then (because I needed the money) I worked fewer hours in order to be spend more time with her. I used to cuddle her, make her feel engaged and loved every time I could from the day she was born to the day she passed away. She is the most stable and loving relationship I ever had in my life. 

I can’t stop crying those days, but what keeps me motivated is the fact that she passed away calmly without any tension before her health became so bad that her life quality would be unacceptable, she lived an amazing life full of love, care, cuddles, walks and attention.

I don’t play games. 

Enter this girl (22F) I’m (24M) currently talking to. After connecting on bumble she seemed into me and I tried to set up a date but her replies to my messages were a bit scattered—either she’d reply right away or I’d hear nothing for 2 days, but she always replied eventually. I set up a date but a couple days before she asked for a rain check. I said no worries and left the ball in her court, assuming she wasn’t that keen. Heard nothing for over a week and naturally assumed she wasn’t into me and moved on. However, then a few days ago she texts me, apologizes for disappearing, and asks to set up a coffee date. 

The date went amazing. Truly one of the best first dates I’ve had. Conversation flowed so easily, we had so much to talk about and align so much on values and other things. Maybe the best connection I’ve had with someone on a first date. The physical barrier wasn’t broken but that’s ok in my book. At the end of the date I suggested we get food next time (we discussed restaurants a ton during the date) and she clearly wanted to. That night I messaged saying I had a great time and would love to take her for dinner, said when I was available. And now no answer! This was 2 days ago. 

Usually I would just say clearly she’s not interested and move on. But with this girl it seems different. Many times while we were talking I assumed I’d never hear from her again but she always replied even if it took a few days. Or in the case of setting up our first date, like a week. 

On one hand, I do think she will answer me and go out with me again. I think if her past behavior shows anything it’s that her lack of prompt replies doesn’t mean she’s not interested in me. On the other hand, I’m losing my mind a little with the uncertainty. I’m trying to think of how this works in her head. Is this her way of taking things slow with me? I don’t really mind slow. Is she like this texting everyone in her life? Is that a bad sign? 

I know the only person that can really answer that is her, but feels way too early to have that convo. Maybe she’s a phone call gal rather than text, I wouldn’t mind that at all. Do I just grit my teeth with the annoyance of not getting consistent replies and see what happens?

Truly confused here and would appreciate thoughts. I would usually assume she’s not interested, but I genuinely think that’s not the case here. I really really like her. ",1,1760562246.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

So sweet I want to explain what this anyone is to people who are you to this world in term it is that your body DOESN'T release what we called happy hormone that makes you feel rewarded that make you feeling good while doing something that you should be fun activity.

Basically I have for like maybe 6 year at this point and Anhedonia has been very annoying part of it since I used love doing a lot of fun activity and now it's just chore to even look at that activity for example watching anime or playing games.

So now what are you doing I have something in important social activity and meeting with people I go out of my way to drink caffeine stuff especially coffee, energy drink also works but I prefer coffee. If I feel okayish them expresso with cream or if I have like shitty mood like I feel like world is just Circus I didn't signed up but still ended up being a part of it, I take just hot/cold Americano. 

After having two cups of caffeine I am in my energized mode, I am running on speed running on energy and I'm doing stuff that  is acceptable as functional in society, basically it's just doing chores in 2x mode. I know the crash is hard when I run out of energy but this is what is working for me as for now.

On days when I don't really have to interact with anybody, I just stay in my room, doesn't matter what emergency comes, doesn't matter what other people needs for me I am in hibernation mode. It's weekend and I am in hibernation mode, my friends wants to party? I ain't going. But if it's a low energy taking activity like just taking a walk by river or in the park, I will give it a chance based on my social battery.

Having boundaries is important here. I have accepted the fact that I won't be able to enjoy a lot of stuff which other people do, so I want to do what is most convenient thing I can do to stay sane.",1,1760562203.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

1o7n4op,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1o7n4op/requesting_heavymetal_test_data_from_chike/,Requesting heavy-metal test data from Chike protein coffee — disappointing (so far)," TL;DR:
Chike claims they test via a third party but refuses to provide results alleging “proprietary reasons.” That non-response (so far) leads me to pause use, especially for my breastfeeding wife. If a company stands behind its data, it should share the data. 

I’ve consumed Chike daily for a while. So has my breastfeeding wife. 

After the Consumer Reports article on lead in protein powders, I today emailed Chike asking for a Certificate of Analysis (COA) for my lot—specifically heavy metals (lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury). I included the lot number and asked about their testing method, lab accreditation, and detection limits. 

Wanted to share my experience digging into Chike protein coffee’s safety and how I approached them about heavy-metal testing. Maybe others here will find it useful, especially since I believe I learned of Chike via a Peter Attia mention in the past.

While I emailed only today, I also called their customer support. The rep said Chike does use third-party testing. But she insisted they will not share test results for “proprietary reasons.” As a lawyer (though not an intellectual property specialist), I see no valid proprietary rationale for hiding heavy metal data. Safety test results are not trade secrets in the usual sense. The rep said she would “ask the lab what might be shareable” and get back to me. I’ll wait for that reply, but in the meantime we’re halting use - especially my wife (who is breastfeeding).

NOTE: I’m not alarmist about the Consumer Reports article for various reasons, and were Chike merely at the Ca Prop 95 thresholds I’d likely keep using (though have my wife pause); I think the CR article was off-base and alarmist in several respects. But I find the lack of transparency in Chike’s initial response itself a red flag. If your product passes heavy-metal limits, and you have those resukts, publishing or disclosing the test results builds consumer trust and risk mitigation. Holding them back raises justifiable doubts.

**Anyone know of an alternative with caffeine (or with a coffee or “protein coffee” style), and COAs/testing?**

I’m an 23M and I lost my childhood dog a few days ago. I had her since I was 9. A beautiful westie. She passed as at almost 14 years old. 

The last 5 months of her life she started showing her age. She started walking with difficulty, and slowly she became totally unable of walking or standing. She had lung cancer and, while she took medication and her cancer almost disappeared, she had a few problems with breathing every now and then. She still had a decent life quality, that’s way we waited for her to pass away and we didn’t put her down. The past few months I constantly go to walks with her holding her, used to give her her favourite snacks, used to play gently with her toys. She was looking at every car, person or dog that passed (her neck was functional), she used to enjoy food and water. 

She passed away at my fathers arms while they were at the vet. Calmly, without any pain or even making a noise. She had a sudden heart arrest. The day before I took her at a car drive and she was looking at my eyes and the window, lying down at my chest. 

She is the reason I am who I am today. The unconditional love she gave me through my childhood, my teenage years and my early adulthood literally shaped me into a better version of myself

I did the best I could to give her a great life. During all those years I used to travel with her, go for walks or coffees with my friends in places I could include her, sleep with her in my arms, have her by my side in almost every part of my day, go for walks in big parks with other dogs in order to socialise. I cancelled my job for 2 months in order to be with her during her last months and then (because I needed the money) I worked fewer hours in order to be spend more time with her. I used to cuddle her, make her feel engaged and loved every time I could from the day she was born to the day she passed away. She is the most stable and loving relationship I ever had in my life. 

I can’t stop crying those days, but what keeps me motivated is the fact that she passed away calmly without any tension before her health became so bad that her life quality would be unacceptable, she lived an amazing life full of love, care, cuddles, walks and attention.

1o7mtp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions/comments/1o7mtp8/from_coffee_shop_daydream_to_deploying_my_first/,From Coffee Shop Daydream to Deploying My First AI Model in Production,"Three months ago, I was sitting in a small, noisy coffee shop near my university, sipping on a bitter espresso I didn’t really like, half-scrolling through Reddit and half-panicking about what I was going to do after graduation. I had taken a few machine learning courses, built some toy projects, and done the usual Kaggle competitions, but nothing felt real. I wanted to build something that actually worked in the wild, something that didn't just run well in a Jupyter notebook but could stand on its own, in production, with actual users relying on it.

That same evening, I overheard someone at the next table talking about how their small e-commerce business was struggling with product return rates. They said something like, People keep returning stuff they didn't mean to buy wrong sizes, wrong colors, sometimes even things they don’t remember ordering. That got me thinking: could I build a model to predict the likelihood of a customer returning a product based on their purchase history?

I didn’t sleep that night. I pulled out my laptop and started sketching out what the pipeline could look like. I scraped some open datasets related to retail purchases and returns and combined them with synthetic data to simulate an e-commerce environment. It was messy, and the data was far from perfect, but it was something.

Over the next few weeks, I built a basic logistic regression model as a starting point. It barely performed above chance. Then I moved to more sophisticated models, XGBoost gave me decent results, but the breakthrough came when I implemented a simple customer behavior embedding using a shallow neural net and combined it with metadata like product category, price range, and customer location. Suddenly, I was hitting over 80% accuracy on my validation set.

I wanted to go further, so I containerized the model using Docker, set up a FastAPI backend, and deployed it on a small EC2 instance. I integrated a simple dashboard where business owners could upload a CSV of recent orders and get predictions instantly. No fancy UI, but it worked. It felt real.

I shared the tool with that same business owner from the coffee shop (I awkwardly introduced myself a week after eavesdropping on them), and they actually tried it. A few weeks later, they told me it helped them flag a set of high-risk purchases and update their product recommendation system to reduce mismatches. That feedback hit different.

Now, I’m not saying this model is revolutionary or even unique. But for me, it was a turning point. I stopped seeing machine learning as something abstract and academic. I started seeing it as a tool that, when used right, can actually solve tiny but real-world problems.

If you’re reading this and stuck in tutorial hell or bouncing between courses without knowing what to build, try listening more. The world is full of small problems waiting for someone who knows how to model data and ship code. My journey started with an overheard conversation and a bad espresso.

1o7mso4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1o7mso4/frozen_coffee_concentrate_pods_with_an_aeropress/,Frozen Coffee Concentrate “Pods” with an Aeropress,"This is a brew recipe I came up with as I was playing around with the leftovers from a bag of preground coffee I was using while waiting for my new grinder to arrive.  I wanted to try to create some frozen pucks of coffee that I could bring to work and put in my office’s freezer, which would create a decent cup of coffee when combined with hot water from the office water dispenser.  I also didn’t want to have to put my aeropress in the fridge overnight, so I tried to make a method that can be done fairly quickly. 

To preface: the coffee this method makes is not super interesting or vibrant or complex.  In fact, it’s  surprisingly mild.  It kind of tastes like hot cold brew, so if you don’t like the way cold brew tastes maybe skip this post.  All that being said, it crushes the other main way to make coffee by just adding hot water (instant coffee), and while not super interesting it’s perfectly drinkable and incredibly convenient.  It’s also way cheaper than Cometeer, which is probably the closest thing to what this is in terms of how you’d use it.  (Though I’m sure cometeer probably tastes a bit better).

Here’s the actual recipe:

1. Add 40g ground coffee to an inverted aeropress (save as much room for yourself as you can, you’re going to be doing a lot of stirring).  I was using preground.  I’d be very interested to hear how different grind sizes worked out if you try this, let me know!  I wouldn’t go too fine because I suspect it would become extremely difficult to press at the end if you clog the filter.
2. Add 30g of just off the boil water.  The water should completely disappear into the grounds, this is fine.  The idea is to kickstart the extraction a little bit because the main bulk of the brew will be at a lower temperature, so you’re doing a little bit of very hot early extraction to make work easier for the rest of the brew. 
3. Wait 20 seconds, then add 100g of room temperature water.
4. Stir for 1 minute, nonstop, pretty fast just not so fast that you risk coffee coming out of the Aeropress. 
5. Let the grounds settle for 30 seconds.
6. Repeat the stir-rest cycle 3 more times (4 total).
7. Flip the Aeropress and press into whatever you want to catch the concentrate in, I recommend using something easy to pour out of (I used a milk frothing pitcher).  You’re going to have to press pretty hard, and press the whole way well past the hiss, you want to get as much out as possible.  You should end up with about half of the liquid you put in (60-70 mL from 130 mL), and it will have a little bit of a head and some tiny bubbles, almost like a Guinness. 
8. Pour the concentrate into 2 little containers to form your frozen pods (I used plastic shot glasses), and immediately put them in the freezer.  
9. Once they are frozen solid, you can store them in a more airtight container (I used a ziploc). 

Once you have your frozen pods, you can just put 200mL or so of hot water over them and it’ll turn right into a cup of coffee.  The coffee is kind of weird, it doesn’t taste like any other brew method I’ve ever had, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.  Each one should have 100-120ish mg of caffeine for a typical arabica. 

I’ve only tried this with a medium roast, I’d be interested to hear how it goes with a lighter or darker roast, and what the extraction level actually is if someone with the ability to measure that wants to give it a try.  If you do try, hope you enjoy!  It’s a pretty convenient “instant coffee” system that you can actually make at home with whatever beans you want, which is something I’ve wanted to try to make for a long time.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

Guest's room was cancelled because he booked with a credit card he had saved to his profile which had previously been reported stolen so he needed to make a new booking.

""I hope it's the same rate I booked before!""

It's actually cheaper sir.

""Good.""


Now, this is where it gets annoying. As I am creating the new reservation, he puts his phone on the counter and makes a call to a work colleague...on SPEAKER PHONE. 

""No, yeah, I'm just checking into my hotel. The TwinPines was sold out. So, that meeting earlier....blah blah blah...""

Note, I need his input during the whole check in process and being the nice person that I am, I steamroll over his conversation by asking every conceivable inane question I can think of and giving him ALL of the info he will likely never need when checking in. Room number, breakfast hours, where the free coffee is, how to get on the wi-fi, parking details, what the weather will be tomorrow, etc. and he keeps having to tell his phone call buddy to hold while he acknowledges everything I tell him and answer the stupid questions I ask him.

After checking him in and giving him his keys, he steps away from the desk and, I shit you not, says this on the phone:

""Ok, I'm going to go park my car. I'll talk to you later at dinner.""

WHAT THE F*CK?!? Your stupid non-conversation was more important than giving me 2 minutes of your day to check into your room?

Gah.

Edit. He came back and had a loud convo on his phone (no speaker this time) while waiting for me to check in another guest. It was mostly in Turkish from what I can decipher. The only English I could pick out were the curse words. ""Blah blah blah YOU'VE GOT TO BE F*CKING KIDDING!! blah blah blah blah blah"".

I’m a 34 y.o. guy, that looking for some friendship with a woman. I’m not an ugly gremlin which gets scared of girls and actually I’ve got a lot of friends, but I just can’t do dates or meet somebody new due to a tough schedule and working in a 99% male crew. That makes finding new connections a bit complicated for me nowadays, while I feel like I really need it now: I’m divorcing after a very very long marriage and missing talks with women tbh. I’m not a perv seeking for somebody to flood with dirty pics and share unwelcome fantasises. Im interested in a warm and cozy friendship, a lovely chatting, talks about common interests, watching movies, playing games together and so on.

Oh and if it matters I’m 182 cm (between 5’11” and 6’) and 75 kg (166 lbs), a former wrestler and a decent soccer player, so still pretty fit, but NOT a crazy bodybuilder which only loves his own body lol.

Here are some things that I like:
Books, movies and TV shows, video games, music. I do also like walking around, explore new cities and hiking too (nowhere to hike in my current area though 🥲). I’m pretty handy and I like doing something in my home and garden by myself. I watch strategic games and chess broadcasts on Twich sometimes.

Favorite Music: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Muse, Norah Jones, Kendrick Lamar, Mac Miller, Led Zeppelin, Zucchero, Delvon Lamarr organ trio, The Cranberries, Sting, Django Reinhardt, Queen, Slipknot, NWA, Arctic Monkeys, Florence & The Machine and many many more.

Favorite directors and movies: most parts of Quentin Tarantino, Jim Jarmusch, The Cohen brothers, Wes Anderson movies;
Pulp Fiction, Reservoir dogs, Django unchained, Coffee and cigarettes, Forrest Gump, Cast away, Terminal, The Deer hunter, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Back to the future, Star Wars (1-6), Fight Club, The Matrix, Inception, The Green mile, The Green book, The Grand Budapest hotel, Dogville, The Wolf of Wall str… I can go on forever, just ask me about your favorite movies, I’m sure we’ll find a lot of common 😊 Oh and I do also love The Lord of the Rings movies and Harry Potter (especially 1-3).

Some favorite TV shows: Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, the Sopranos, Scrubs, Shameless (the US version), Yellowstone, Misfits, Game of thrones (disappointed by its final but still a good one to watch), Californication, Twin Peaks…and Supernatural lol (1-5 season were best, but love it all anyway).

There might be a huge list of books here, but I read too many of them, so ask me better :) 

Games: The Elder Scrolls 3-5, Kingdom Come Deliverance, The Witcher series, Divinity Original Sin (Baldur’s gate 3 too but still didn’t walk it through), Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, Mafia, SW Jedi Fallen Order, Red dead redemption 2, Sleeping dogs, God of war (2018 & Ragnarok), and much much more.

Online games: Age of Empires 2, GTA Online, PUBG, Forza Horizon 4-5, but I’m up to try anything else.

Well… There was quite a long read, but if you’re still here and you’ve noticed something nice in me or maybe some common interests, please, feel free to send me a DM. Thanks for reading it and I wish you have a very nice day 😊",3,1760560727.0,IntrovertsChat,2,0.81,False

I(F18) started uni on 2 September and i made a guy(M20) friend. I usually dont befriend men so idk if his behaviour is normal or if he is just straight up rude. 

I have to admit that i am a very giggly person. I went to the library with the guy and we studied together and in between the breaks we were making dumb jokes and laughed about it. When we walked to the train station after the library, he told me ive gotten ‘too comfortable’ which ig means I am annoying. He also belittles me a lot, one example is ab my diet, he think i eat unhealthy (not fat shaming). Or today we went to buy some food out and ate it and he told me ‘u r pretending to be petit bc u take such small bites’ like he just makes me feel very self aware but on a way that is not cool at all. After we ate something we went to smoke weed and he got high but me not bc it was my first time. He has like a drink and i asked him if i could drink some and he told me i could only drink ‘a really small amount’ while i always give him my drink. Like even after that happened we went to a cafe and he had coffee and me tea and after he finished his coffee he asked me for my tea and at first i said no bc u were being a dickhead ab me asking for a sip but then i gave him some tea anyways (he also slurped it which is disgusting like buy ur own tea if u want to drink it that way). I have to admit that i mock him too but in a very joyful way and i always clarify after that i am just joking.

My boyfriend told me he might like me and he is teasing me bc he also does try to make me laugh alot (which suddenly is ‘too comfortable’) and bc he looks at me alot. He also tries to spend alot of time with me and tells me that he will only come to school if im going. Still doesnt make me think his comments r ok though

He has dark humour which i have too so its not like im a softy. He also punched my arm before ‘as a joke’ and I didnt make a deal ab that too. So my question is: is this behaviour normal and if not, how can I deal with it? ",0,1760560675.0,AskMenAdvice,27,0.5,False

I’ve been enjoying pretty good coffee with my wife, for several years in our city, and we have a pretty good espresso setup (Lelit Mara X and DF64 grinder), but I’d like to take this even further where I’d like to try my hand at roasting our own coffee!

1o7md4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1o7md4g/i_think_i_hate_my_boyfriends_friend/,I think I hate my boyfriends friend,"I (F33) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (M36) for almost 4 years now.

When we met, we both had this friend (F32), lets call her T.  
Me and T were friends for about 3 years, when I met my boyfriend. We used to have a lot of fun together and had quite a few things in common. We would talk in text on a daily basis and the few times we didn't, there would be no bad blood, because we knew we both had things that kept us busy (work, family ect). We would sometimes meet up for coffee or lunch, but it wasn't that often, because we live 10 hours drive away from eachother, so it would only be when one of us where in town.

Fast forward 3 years and I met my boyfriend because he was a friend of hers. Me and him started hitting it off right away, and he quickly became one of my best friends. We would talk about everything and we got to know eachother very well in a short amount of time. After a while, we started seeing eachother as more than friends, but kept it private in the beginning.

Since T was a mutual friend, she was one of the few people, who knew about us dating.

At first, it was really fun having a mutual friend. T was one of my closest friends and was one of my boyfriends closest friends as well, which means we had a lot of fun all 3 of us.

I would sometimes talk to T about ''issues'' in me and my boyfriends relationship, because 1) she was my closest female friend at the time and 2) she had known my boyfriend longer than me, and could give advice based on things like why he might react a certain way to things compared to me. Just normal stuff between two friends.

After me and my boyfriend decided to make things official, T started acting a little weird. It was small things at first, like wanting more attention from us both or always wanting to know what we talked about without her. I noticed her change in behaviour, but decided to ignore it, since it was small things.

After about 2 years in the relationship, T was getting more weird. At this time, to the point where I found it hard to look past it. She would be like a kid that just got a new baby sister or brother. Constantly demanding attention, get mad if I knew more about my boyfriend than her and would throw a fit when we did things without her. I found this really weird and very annoying. I did keep it to myself, since i thought she might be going through some stuff.

Time passed and she started to only wanting to hang out with me, if I would bring my boyfriend along. If I didn't want to bring him, she suddenly couldn't find the time or ''something would come up''. This really bothered me a lot and I talked to my boyfriend about it, who told me to ask her what was going on. When I did she asked me why it was a problem. If I was jealous of her and him. I told her that was such a weird comment to make, since it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with me and her. She just laughed it off and promised to find time for us (spoiler alert, its been 2 more years and she still haven't). I trusted her on this and things went on as usual.

Things escalated when me and my boyfriend had an argument and I went to T to talk about it. I called her up and was very upset about the whole thing and she just told me ''you should just break up with him''. I told her that seemed a bit extreme, since the argument wasn't that big of a deal in the big picture. She then told me that we seemed to have a lot of issues. Mind you, we had one argument in 2,5 years. This didn't sit right with me and I stopped talking to T about my boyfriend from that point on.

T would keep being all about herself and getting attention, but from that point on, just from my boyfriend. She kept contact with me at a minimum and would blame it on being too tired from work or having to cook dinner for her fiancé. Which would be totally acceptable.... IF she didn't text my boyfriend all night while she told me these things.

Fast forward to 7 months ago, she randomly stopped talking to me all together. When I asked her why she would, she freaked out and yelled at me over the phone. Telling me I was a bad friend for making her feel guilty about it. Saying I was the one that didn't want to talk to her. Saying I didn't even care about her. When i told her, she hadn't even asked about how I'm doing for a whole year, she then blamed it on me. Saying that my boyfriend said I was doing fine, so how would she know. I told her it was kinda strange to ask my boyfriend about my mental health and not me and she just laughed in my face.

I know it's not very nice to say you hate someone, but at this point I'm fuming. I'm so mad about her shitty behaviour and her bratty attitude and her need to be the center of my boyfriends world. I wish she would just go away and never come back in my life. But seeing how she's his friend as well, I'm not seeing that happening. I'm just so mad I could explode. She is so ready to throw away a 7 year friendship over me knowing her friend better than her, BECAUSE I'M DATING HIM. I just can't believe it.

1o7maxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1o7maxh/cya_ms_matsuda/,"Cya, Ms. Matsuda","The alarm blared at the headquarters, not one of those annoying sirens singing like an out of tune rooster preventing people from hearing their own thoughts, but something much more terrifying, the alarm from within, the realization there’s no more road for this can to be kicked and the moment of truth has come.



\-The Minister is on a call with Mr. Aslan. She asked for you. - Said my assistant ten seconds or ten thousand years ago.



Humanity’s diaspora throughout the stars had been a less elegant affair than the likes of Gene Rodenberry envisioned. Brave captains and brilliant engineers have this annoying habit of sticking to their prestigious jobs and cozy homes under the blue skies of Earth and so, like it was in the age of great navigations, it was the criminals, religious zealots and general wackos who had taken to settle distant worlds.



Skip a few dozen generations and what was seen in the outer systems was not exactly what one would call “functional governments”, nor their handling of the unwieldy tangle of competing interests called macroeconomy anything close to orthodox policy, but more a furious succession of “get rich quick” schemes in a planetary scale, with predictable results.



Years prior, I was not in the mood to watch a boring statics lecture, Jojo not to watch… whatever it is they teach at interstellar relations. We sneaked to the bar close to campus and ordered a beer.



\-This is bonkers.

\-It worked before. That’s how Schacht took Germany out of the First Great Depression.

\-You mean that’s what literal Nazi do.

\-It works. When inflation is fastly reaching 40% a month you can’t just trim the bush, you need to burn it.

\-You can’t just have two currencies at the same time!

\-You can, as long as you tell nobody.

\-This is not something normal people can live with.

\-Fortunately for us, we descend from Space Amish, we’re anything but normal.



She raised her arm and waved to the bartender.



\-Cancel the beer, my bud has had enough.

\-We haven’t drunk yet.

\-And you’re already drunk.

\-I’m the one who studies economics.

\-No, you’re the one skipping econ class and given what I’m hearing, you really shouldn’t.



Then, months ago, I was summoned by the newly appointed Finance Minister, the third this year.



\-You’re crazy, you’ve always been crazy and that plan of yours is even crazier. But I’m desperate enough to try something crazy. -  Minister Meindl told me.

\-That’s an awful way to ask me for help, Jojo.

\-Cut the crap, Raj. We’re both stuck on this forsaken rock at the edge of human space and for some reason the chancellor put me in charge of getting it back on track. I need your help. You in or out?



Following that half-serious advice from her younger self, I had, indeed, gone through my boring econ classes and what they taught me was that, while my crazy plan would work, there was a lot of plowing to do before the nuts were planted in the ground.



Our debts to the inner systems were a relentless sea, burying us under wave after wave each time we came to the surface for air. Every day another piece of it would come due, every time we considered taking a moment to view the bigger picture another fire would break out and we would rush to it with the only firehose we had, and there went the money printer firing on all cylinders, and there went our inflation targets out the window.



Earth had thrown us a life vest or, more accurately, was waving it at us like a siren song, demanding our tired arms and exhausted legs swim in their direction.



Brainchild of the Chief Financial Advisor of Sol, the Aslan Plan proposed buying the debts of the outer systems and exchange them for a single, rational debt to Earth, with yearly, predictable payments, which would give us time to figure our shit out and restore some semblance of normalcy to our economies.



The plan, of course, required us to provide guarantees in the form of primary Sol bonds, which, naturally, none of the outer systems had any way to provide. In such situations, it was customary for the lesser economies of humanity to run to the Sugar Daddy Reserve and bask in its generous loans, just-cuz-yo-ma-special-boy interest rates and everyone-goes-through-a-rough-patch installments.



Problems was, a not insignificant part of our debts to be included in the Aslan Plan were due to the SDR. In fact, they had stopped answering our texts; in fact, when we knocked at their doors, they would turn off the lights and pretend no one was home; actually, last I checked there were portraits of all our senior government officials in their headquarters subtitled “If sighted, beat with a stick until it goes away”.



We had to knock on another door, their door. The Stern Stepmother Fund.



The attache assigned to us received us. Jojo handled all the ceremonial pleasantries, while I quietly stood one step behind, playing my role of well behaved puppy. I didn’t mind, I had no skill for all the phony small talk, nor any willingness to acquire such skill. My job was to get shit done and leave the petty politics to our distinguished Finance Minister.



After Ms. Matsuda whipped Jojo’s ass for the thirteenth time (she failed to answer “I’ve been a fiscally irresponsible girl, hit me harder, Mommy!” once, so an extra whip had to be given), I could finally start my presentation.



Just like I had rehearsed, the dazzling numbers came on screen, our economic indicators paired with historical precedents, the plan to put the second currency in circulation, the reforms in the works and what was so dazzling about that bitch’s nails? Can’t that SoB give a shred of her attention to the two clowns who flew halfway across the galaxy to meet her?



I looked at Jojo, standing by her chair, she gave me a quick nod, signaling me to go on. After I begrudgingly finished, dat bitch, without looking away from her nails, spoke:



\-Have you seen the results from Pampa Estrelada?



If I had seen Pampa Estrelada? Of course I’d seen the half baked plan of the Viking Commie Financebros. Of course it worked, why wouldn’t it? How can you possibly have inflation when you throw your currency in the trash and replace it with Terracoin? Nevermind doing so is to willingly become a satellite, with its nose stuck deeper into Earth’s ass than Luna.



I raised my finger in a start of objection, Ms. Matsuda’s whip broke the sound barrier and hit it before I could speak, her eyes still on those fucking nails.



\-In my humble opinion you should take a look at the successful experiences of your neighbors before trying to reinvent the wheel.



The journey home was shrouded in an eerie silence. It wasn’t that the SSF didn’t like our plan, it didn’t listen. After so much money thrown into crypto, so many Nutriblast crates still lying on our sea floor, they didn’t care what we had concocted this time. Either we copied the Viking Commie scheme or there was no loan; either we surrendered our economic sovereignty or got crushed under the weight of our debt. It didn’t matter we were putting the house in order, or had a tested and proven plan, or a substantial influx of alien currency…



“Wait, substantial influx of alien currency?” I thought to myself. As if seeing the lightbulb flaring over my head, Jojo rose from her donut, while I forgot my finger was still in the glass and spilled bourbon on the rocks all over the floor.



The advantage of living in a former Space Amish pirate outpost is that you have no shortage of connections to coffee snorting Krilaxes and Yenari catnip junkies. No barely sane sapient would accept a currency, our currency, which lost half its value monthly, but maybe we could find those who would accept to trade the xeno coins for Terracoins, just enough to get those bonds we needed.



I put up the numbers on screen, I set up the formulas, made the calculations. It was enough, just enough to get what we needed, *if* the exchange rate would remain relatively stable, *if* the price of Sol bonds stayed constant. It wouldn't, once word got out we were on the hunt for Terracoin, that it became clear we were shopping for Sol bonds, speculation would set in.



Jojo looked at the numbers on screen, pondered for a moment and, without averting her gaze, said:



\-Leave it to me.



Something you need to know about Minister Meindl is that, long before she became the second most powerful person in our corner of the galaxy, she was Jojo, a people person, not necessarily good people, not necessarily out to any good, aaaaaaaand it’s finally dawning  on me why she got into politics.



She had a guy who could buy in-game loot with alien coin and resell it to Earthlings, another guy who could get bonds from private equities that were really interest in people not finding out they were liquidating their assets, one more guy specialized in taking people out of human space speedily and discretely, always looking for alien currency… And so, we managed to pulverize our operation among a thousand guys, throughout several months, not raising any alarm bells to the speculative parasites.



With the financial wheels spinning, came the issue of politics.



Formally an independent interstellar organization, it was an open secret that the Stern Stepmother Fund was Sol’s attack dog. As its largest contributor by far, Sol held *de facto* control over the SSF and didn’t shy away from using it to whip into place misbehaved economies such as ourselves.



That was, all of the outer systems knew, the true purpose of the Aslan Plan. The cozy lifeboat put within our view had an entrance ticket none of us could afford, we would run to the SSF, who would impose terms and conditions made by Earthlings, for Earthlings, while the government in Istanbul kept posing as humanity’s mommy, embracing her misbehaved children and blowing their self-inflicted boo-boos.



Our scheme was a wrench thrown into this plan. A real, tangible example that life was possible without licking the boots of Earth and its lackeys, that humanity didn’t need to orbit around that pale blue dot lost deep into our skies, but that each of us could carve our own faith, shape our own destiny. Once we knocked on Earth’s door, Sol bonds in hand, there was nothing they could do without dropping the facade.



That is, if we could get those damn bonds. If Earth found out what we were doing before that, we were royally and utterelly fucked.



That’s why I had to walk the 10,000 miles and 1 million heartbeats between my office and Jojo’s. She was perfectly capable of handling Mr. Aslan on her own; lying, deceiving and stalling were, after all, in her job description, but it would be weird to brief him on the ongoing negotiations with the SSF without the attaché appointed to the task by her side, and that was me. For the past weeks I had dealt with Ms. Matsuda, strategically running out of battery, having my account hacked and fastly running out of grandmas to unalive (thank God for the two dads and three moms in my mutant family tree).



As I walked into her office, Jojo was at the end of the ceremonial phony pleasantries. She was about to start talking about our dealings with the SSF when Aslan dropped a nuke onto our heads:



\-Are you the ones buying Sol bonds?



My gut knew it and it tried to warn me. The 1,000 ton my feet suddenly weighted, the heartbeats that tried to spare me by giving me a heart attack, the door to Jojo’s office, just across the hall, that suddenly was a marathon away, all desperate pleas for me to stay put, to run away from the tsunami that announced itself at the receding shores.



My gut knew much, but not everything. My mind held a secret from it: my job was to get shit done, politics was the job of Josilda Akbari Meindel, ∞dan black belt in the dark art of bullsh…



\-How many bonds have we bought, Raj?



Reality lagged for a moment as my biodisc processed what just happened, then my arms stretched forward and my hands squeezed Jojo’s neck, while her right hand tried pulling my wrist away and her left arm stood in a half T-pose. Shouting in silence, my lips moved furiously, pronouncing unspeakable words, in an attempt to make her see the brainfart, no, brain diarrhea that had covered all of our hard work, probably the future of our entire system.



Still, my eyes didn’t find the concave eyebrows, the deflated cheeks, the signs of regret the years had taught me to look for in my old friend’s face. My gaze expanded in search of an apology, a sign of empathy, anything in the bobble-head doll that a moment ago I called friend, finally landing at her extended left arm, I instinctively followed its direction.



Only then I recalled that, instead of using audio and text like normal people, Earthling politicians had this weird obsession with video calls. My certainly ninja-like movements brought my sleeve to the rescue of the abundant droll hanging from the Finance Minister’s face, before a 180 db slap politely declined the kindness. Turning and facing the Chief Financial Advisor of Sol, I, in most dignifying and solemn voice, pronounced:



\-We have enough bonds for three quarters of the demanded guarantees.

\-So, in this rhythm, you should have it all in a month's time?

\-Correct.

\-If I order at the Terra Bank a special issue of the remaining bonds, can you transfer the funds by the end of the week?

\-Certainly, Mr. Aslan.

\-Good. Have a nice day.



What I had not noticed, but Jojo did, is that when Aslan asked if we were buying bonds, there was no anger in his voice, but the wonder of a child who had seen a dinosaur for the first time and realized dragons are real. It had never occurred to Earth that an outer system could raise such capital on their own; more than that, Sol’s economy was a collection of bubbles held together by duct tape, spit and prayers, its ordinary people fed up with dead end jobs and monetizing hobbies to no avail. If an outer system could stand on its own two feet, that opened new investment opportunities and prospects for the common folk, who might now migrate in search of greener pastures and relieve some pressure from the overstretched social services of Sol.



Overnight we went from misbehaved child of humanity to its rising star. It wasn’t the end of our problems, but I finally had a solid foundation from which to put my crazy plan into action; with her unexpected success and earned trust from the financial markets, none dared contradict Minister Meindl, uncrowned queen of our corner of the cosmos.



I grabbed my phone, took a picture of my ass, especially unshaven for the occasion, subtitle added stating “Cya, Ms. Matsuda.”

I have known my friend (we are both 30F) since we were very young, but we became closer friends as adults with common interests who moved back to our home town. This friend has ADHD, and I suspect may be on the spectrum, but she's never been formally diagnosed. I have a milder form of ADHD.

We reconnected through work/hobbies that can be done on our computers at a coffee shop. We started meeting at least once a month at the coffee shop on a Saturday or Sunday. However, she is always late to these meetings. I don't mean 15 or 20 minutes late; she is regularly arrives 1-2 hours later than the established time, even 3-4 hours on one occasion. Since I usually don't plan anything for well after our meet up time, these 2 hour late hang outs usually eat my entire day. I sometimes don't even start getting ready until the time we are supposed to be there because I know she won't be there when she said she would. When she does arrive, she is so upset and worried that I will be mad at her, that I end up comforting her for being late.

I started reframing these meet ups in my mind to, ""I'm going to hang out at this coffee shop today, and Friend may show up"" to keep myself from getting too frustrated about it as I know some people with ADHD/AUDHD struggle with time management and focus. However, recently she invited me to a few events that had to start at a specific time (think movie, play, club meeting) and was so late she almost missed the events entirely. For one, we were supposed to meet two hours before an event. I got there thirty minutes late and still had to buy her ticket, almost missed having a meal waiting around for her, and had to run into the venue to make it before the event started. I was upset but didn't want it to ruin the night, so I kept brushing her off when she kept bringing up being late. It freaked her out and I then had to comfort her after the event was over.

This has extended into a shared club. She has now started asking me to tell the club leader she will be late and explain circumstances so she doesn't have to. She called me ten minutes before to ask me to walk in and explain her absence/lateness to the club leader. If she is doing something after we hang out, I have also started having to keep track of the time to make sure she leaves to make it to her work/another event in time. I feel like she's passing off the responsibility of her being on time to me in some ways. 

I have tried suggesting time management tips from ADHD creators online, sharing tricks that work for me, sending her cool apps that help with task completion, and talking her through the struggle she's having. She seems receptive but then it turns into more of a ""I wish the world was easier, no one prepared me for this"" conversation. I understand she struggles more than other people and more than me with the mental health issues she experiences, but I am almost at my limit with this. We have a lot in common and have fun when we hang out, but I don't know how to approach this issue without her spiraling and having to comfort her over it! Have I done as much as I can do? Is there a better approach to this given her mental health struggles?",1,1760560223.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I'll start by saying I prefer to drink my coffee black which somewhat limits the variety in what I'll be drinking, but im not above the occasional specialty beverage. I tend to lean on the cappucino as a simple guage for how well they can prepare these, what I'll call, luxury beverages. I sample both regular black coffee and a cappuccino when I visit a new cafe.

Coffee isnt the only thing I judge about a location. The character of a venue imbues what I'll call the 'je ne sais quois' factor to coffee experience, and does a lot to enhance my overall enjoyment of a warm beverage.

Can anyone suggest new cafes around the city to try? I'm not above a nice cup of pf tea either, and if they serve coffee as well then all the better.

I was so eager to impress them. We had agreed on a modest monthly budget for their Google Ads—let's say around $1,500. My plan was to run a tight, optimized campaign to drive local traffic for their amazing cupcakes.

One evening, fueled by too much coffee, I was 'optimizing' the campaign settings. You know how it is, clicking through screens, feeling like a digital wizard. In a moment of pure brain-fart, I must have entered the *monthly* budget into the *daily* budget field. I hit save, closed my laptop feeling proud of my hard work, and went to bed.

I woke up the next morning to the kind of email notification that makes your soul leave your body. It was a payment alert from Google for $1,500. My heart literally stopped. I scrambled to open the dashboard, and there it was, in glorious, horrifying color: thousands of clicks, a sky-high CTR, and the entire monthly budget, gone. Vanished. Spent overnight driving traffic for cupcakes between 11 PM and 7 AM.

The dread of making that phone call was worse than the mistake itself. I rehearsed my apology a dozen times, fully expecting to be fired on the spot. I called the owner, my voice shaking, and just laid it all out. I owned it completely—it was my fault, no excuses. I told her I would cover the cost myself and work for the next month for free to make it right. There was this long, terrifying silence on the other end of the line.

But then, she just... laughed. She said, 'Well, we were wondering why the phone started ringing at 5 AM for pre-orders!' It turned out the catastrophic ad spend had generated a massive, albeit chaotic, surge in business. She appreciated my honesty so much that she not only kept me on but agreed to my new plan to focus on organic growth. That mistake taught me to triple-check every single digit, but also that owning your screw-ups is everything. We ended up working together for another two years.

I can't tell if this girl is playing hard to get or if she's just busy/patient,"***Prepare for a long, great story; please read. Involved (Me (22M) Her (19F))***

I share a couple classes with this girl in university, and we've definitely had growing interest for each other all semester, along with increasing eye contact during our lab classes; I've picked up lots of signs from her, and she always laughs and smiles at my jokes, etcetera.

Well, this past Monday, I made the decision I wanted to ask her out some way since it's the halfway point in the semester. One of my gazes was extra-long and she laughed and smiled, ""why are you staring at me?"" and then asked, ""how was your fall break?"" immediately after. We talked frequently during the lab.

Towards the end of class, I ask her a question about an assignment, and then I ask her about where she was going to lunch (she came up to the front of the class with me where I was). I was quite nervous because I haven't made an advance like that, and she knew what I was doing. When she told me where she was going, she said ""we should go"" in a quiet voice while looking at her phone (probably nervous too), and I was stunned (yes, I was). I didn't know what to say (in the midst of 100bpm+ heartrate) and then I said, ""and are you going to that pop-up thrift store after that?"" she said yes. She told me she was going after she picked up her food and she said, ""I'll see you there"" and I said, ""I'll be there.""  She walked away and I texted her right after I was on the way and she sent a text back.

I finally met her at the pop-up thrift shop, and we hung out for 20 minutes or so before her next class. I told her to pick out a shirt, and I would buy it for her, she appreciated it. She eventually had to go to her next class and I asked her ""Would you want to hang out again?"" and she said ""Yes, we should do coffee."" I said, ""What about climbing? (indoor rock climbing))"" She said ""Hmm climbing? I'll have to think about it."" So, I said ""Ok then coffee, and then maybe climbing."" I told her bye and that I enjoyed it. **I must note** that I was nervous (she was too) and I didn't talk as much as I wanted to because I couldn't catch my heartrate, but I still had good chats.

Next day (yesterday), I had another class with her (but she doesn't sit at my table); we don't get a lot of interaction in this class usually, as compared to the Monday lab. I waited for her outside the classroom as we left and I asked her ""Hey, do you still wanna do coffee?"" She waited a couple seconds and said, ""Um I don't know, I'm like really busy"" (I think maybe she was about to say I'll have to let you know when I'm free but got cut off). So, I think she thought I was asking to do it today, but I wasn't. After that I told her ""Just let me know whenever you're free, just text me.""

We walked down the stairs, and she asked me ""How did you do on your test?"" (we got our graded tests back). I told her and asked her what she got too as we walked outside. I got a perfect score, and she got 3 points from perfect. I told her ""Nobody's perfect, oh except for me"" and she smiled and said, ""Oh right just you"" As we walked away from each other, I told one last time ""just let me know, text me."" She said, ""I will."" The end.

What a dramatic story, I know. Unfortunately, after our thrifting hangout on Monday, I asked AI instantly after what I should do next. It told me I should follow up the next day, so I did; that's the only reason I did. It told me I should have followed up the next day so that I still ""showed my interest."" First of all, I shouldn't have used AI, that was my BIGGEST (I only did because I'm nervous and new at this and wanted instant validation/feedback), NEVER again. I was doing so well being natural, but AI has recently hijacked my ability to be myself, so I won't ever do that again.

**\*\*My question and thoughts are is:** Monday's lab she interacts with me the most, no doubt. Tuesday/Thursday's classes not as much because I think it's not as setup or convenient. Literally every Monday she gives me signs, and finally this Monday happened. I'm wondering if you all think that was a huge mistake asking her again (based on stupid AI), or if it's fine and I should just wait for her to respond back to me. Some of my friends thought she might genuinely be busy, being in a sorority, having tests this week, etc. Who knows. I know she likes me, even the TA at the front desk heard us talking about going to the thrift store and after the girl left, the TA said ""I think she likes you.""

1o7lza8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1o7lza8/explore_best_kitchen_appliance_slider_tray_from/,Explore Best Kitchen Appliance Slider Tray from Baemin Worth It,"The Baemin B0DMSSB4L5 acrylic appliance slider quickly became an essential item in my kitchen the moment I started using it. As someone who frequently makes coffee, uses a blender, and loves experimenting with air fryer recipes, I needed a solution to keep my countertops organized while making heavy appliances more accessible. This sliding tray does exactly that, and I’ve been testing it on a daily basis to evaluate its true value.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the sturdy acrylic material caught my attention. The clear design blends effortlessly into any kitchen while adding a modern touch. It’s not just aesthetically pleasing, though; the acrylic construction is thick and durable, giving a sense of reliability. Its dimensions – 14 x 9.8 x 0.79 inches – provide ample space for heavy appliances like coffee makers, air fryers, and even my trusty stand mixer. Moreover, the silent rubber wheels on the bottom glide effortlessly without leaving scratches or dents on the countertop, which is a huge plus for anyone protective of their glossy surfaces.  

**Effortless Appliance Movement**   
The most significant highlight for me has been how easy it is to maneuver my appliances. Gone are the days when lifting my bulky air fryer felt like a workout. With this slider, I can pull it forward seamlessly, avoiding the awkward leaning and tugging I used to do. The smooth rolling rubber wheels ensure the tray moves silently, even with items as heavy as my loaded coffee machine. It also helps prevent steam damage to cabinets by making it possible to slide appliances out from beneath them without hassle.  

[Check Baemin B0DMSSB4L5 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0dmssb4l5/)  

**Versatile Size Options and Adaptability**  
Baemin offers two sizes of the tray, catering to both standard dual coffee makers and larger appliances, which is highly thoughtful. I personally used the 14 x 9.8-inch model, which worked perfectly for my kitchen setup. From blenders to rice cookers, this tray can accommodate a wide variety of appliances. It’s great for households with multiple gadgets, and I tested it with almost everything I own. Switching between the appliances wasn’t an issue at all.  

**User-Friendly Features**  
The ergonomic handle deserves a special mention. It’s surprising how such a simple inclusion can make a product so much easier to use. It required minimal effort to grip and maneuver the tray, even when I had my full-sized mixer sitting on it. An added bonus is the integrated cable organizer that keeps appliance wires neatly tucked away. This feature has improved how my counter looks dramatically, giving a more decluttered and organized vibe. Cleaning the tray after use was hassle-free, too. A quick wipe with a damp cloth was all it took to get rid of spills or smudges.  

**Highlights**  
- Sleek and modern acrylic design that suits all kitchens.  
- Rolls silently and smoothly without damaging counter surfaces.  
- Fits a wide variety of appliances, from coffee makers to air fryers.  
- Ergonomic handle and cable organizer for added convenience.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its many merits, there are a few aspects worth addressing.   
- The acrylic surface can be prone to smudges, meaning it requires frequent cleaning to look pristine.  
- While the rubber wheels are silent, they occasionally slip slightly during movement if not aligned correctly.  
- A higher weight capacity rating could make it suitable for almost any appliance, though it handles most heavy items admirably.  

**Product Contenders**  
Examining similar products in the market, I noticed differences that set this slider apart while highlighting a few areas it could improve to be more competitive. Other brands feature sliders with alternative materials, such as stainless steel or rubber-coated bases, which sometimes allow for better weight distribution. However, these often lack the sleek and minimalist look of the Baemin model. The rubber wheels here outperform many competitors' sliding mechanisms, which can feel clunky or make noise on harder surfaces. That said, some alternative sliders offer adjustable sizing, which might be preferable for users with varying countertop sizes.   

**Cost Efficiency**  
For what it offers, this tray absolutely justifies its cost. If you’ve ever juggled heavy appliances on your countertop, you’ll know how valuable a tool like this can be. Compared to manually lifting and reorganizing appliances every morning, this sliding tray offers an affordable and stress-reducing solution that feels like a premium addition to my kitchen setup.

1o7lykt,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1o7lykt/18_months_and_what_ive_learned_along_the_way/,18 months and what I've learned along the way.,"Good evening guys, I've recently hit my 18 months sober and I thought I would share some of my thoughts, more of just a sounding off but if younget something from it then bonus.
Now these are my thoughts this isn't definitive official AA advice, what works for me might not for you so tread carefully.

The main thing I want to touch on is the early days.
They are fucking dark, well they were for me, don't kick yourself if you feel like shit in the early days, make sure you make time for yourself and self care.
Don't be afraid to take time out, but balance it out, dont get in the habit of locking yourself away for everyday you lock away, make yourself take some time in fresh air, even if it is a walk around the block or a coffee outside make sure you are getting fresh air amd day light.

Secondly, don't be afraid to drop people, I've came across this situation more than once where people will insist on you having a drink because it's their birthday or some celebration.
Do not be afraid to say no, and if they take a pissy fit, drop em.
Sobriety above all else, I'd they can't be happy having you in their company minus a drink don't be afraid to strike them off, this is your life we are talking about here, and in time you will feel so empowered and so grateful you managed to say no.

Thirdly.

When you come into AA you will meet all sorts of people, some you jive with and make excellent friends with, others you will want to keep at arms length.
This is OK.
You don't have to like everyone in AA, infact I've been told if you like everyone you meet in AA you aren't going to enough meetings.
However if you do meet someone in group that you don't gel with, being civil costs nothing.
Say hello, wish them well on their celebrations and even offer a well done handshake.
Unless they are propperly dangerous or toxic there's no reason to be combative.

Fourth.

Old timers.

These guys and girls can be a great fountain of knowledge and usually are good AAs stick with them, granted you probably won't agree on everything they say but most of the tike they can be invaluable especially when you are new in sobriety and they can often see things you can't.

On the other hand just because someone has a long time in AA doesn't make them the bees knees, I've met some old timers that are totally toxic and give out nonsense or even dangerous advice which I wouldn't touch with a barge pole, but as with all things AA take the people and things that work for you and leave the stuff that doesn't.

Finally

Zoom meetings

I know of a lot of people that will have nothing to do with zoom meetings and will often loudly tell anyone who will listen they don't work like face to face meetings do.

I'm living proof that if you find the right meeting with the right people anything is possible, I'm 18 months sober and have never been to an in person meeting, I know of guys with 5 and more years who do this on zoom only.

Try both you might find that zoom only works for you you might find you enjoy face to face more, either is OK but don't bash those that differ with you.

With that I hope you all have a good day and happy sobriety.",9,1760559500.0,alcoholicsanonymous,4,1.0,False

A young Caucasian woman, 22 years old, with light freckled skin and visible pores, stands relaxed at a busy city crosswalk in an unedited iPhone photo aesthetic, everything in sharp focus from foreground to background; she wears a black and blue Supreme jacket and carries a white shoulder bag, her hair pulled into a neat bun, slightly tilted and off-center in the frame, with casual framing that captures the surrounding street scene, including a Starbucks Coffee sign, yellow taxi cab, pedestrians, and scaffolding-clad buildings, early evening light casting warm tones on brick facades, and the overall mood crisp and candid as if captured mid-mostasis, with natural textures and pores visible on the skin, subtle shadows, and a sense of urban motion.



**why it works**: locks the aesthetic: unedited iPhone look, everything in focus. nails context: Starbucks sign, yellow cab, scaffolding, pedestrians sets composition: off-center, casual framing. specifies light and time. calls out skin texture so the model doesn’t “beauty filter” it

(also i made it with Prompshot which saved me some time thb)  


Shitty prompt:  
pretty girl on city street, supreme jacket, starbucks sign, yellow taxi, realistic photo, 8k hdr, cinematic, masterpiece, perfect lighting, centered portrait, streetwear aesthetic, ultra sharp details



**why this sucks:** vague subject (what girl? doing what? no composition or camera info “cinematic/high quality” do nothing on their own. zero constraints, so the model does whatever



How to fix it?

* say what kind of  camera vibe u want: “unedited iPhone photo,” “everything in focus,” “no beauty retouch.”
* be concrete: brands/signage/props that actually exist in frame (e.g., Starbucks sign, yellow cab).
* composition first: off-center, casual framing, eye-level, include background activity.
* time + light: “early evening warm light,” “overcast flat light,” stuff like that
* texture the texurs: pores, fabric creases, scuffed asphalt, reflections.

Naturally, I love gaming, anime, reading, sports *(American football and hockey currently)*, graphic design, music *(mainly rap, some soul, and some rock),* and many other things.

Very much prefer VC over chatting, but I'll very much chat. Doesn't matter if we're playing the same game or something different. We can still voice chat. I'm also a reciprocator of the friendship; if I get the feeling you're disconnected, I'll take the hint. Granted, I'll occasionally check in, but my priority is where each cup is being filled equally, naturally. 

I've created some lasting friendships here, some still standing, and we game weekly, two to three times a week. So I'm well aware that gaming friendships are possible here. My rotation of games currently is

* **League of Legends**
* **Final Fantasy XIV**
* **Helldivers 2**

I have a gaming buddy I play **Baldur's Gate 3** with two to three times a week. We're playing honor mode, evil playthrough currently, unless we naturally fail. I MAY do another story, but it's very much a *""I gotta make sure you aren't a one-and-done gamer.""* Lol, this feels so much like dating *""Not down for a one-night stand.""* Anyway, I started playing **LoL** and got to a point where I need some homies to game with. I'm mainly a support and bot lane player. My main is **Seraphine**, whether it's *support* and *APC.* Also down for **Morgana** support or mid lane. Been slowly learning **Smolder** as well.

Not looking for anyone sweaty, but also naturally looking to win. 

I have 200+ games, so we could find something else as well. I'm huge on strategy games. Have another gaming buddy where we'll game once or twice a week, that's strategy-based. Love the **Total War** series, mainly **Three Kingdoms**. But I'm also down for **Stellaris**, **Crusader Kings**, **Civ**, and thinking about **Age of Wonders**.

As for **Final Fantasy XIV**, I just started a week or two ago. So if you're interested, I'll very much level with you. I enjoy the aspect of the relaxed level while we talk about anything. The game, life, anything really. Could be convinced to start a **WoW** account depending. I do have a buddy I play with occasionally on Final Fantasy, who's higher level and started a new character. So we occasionally level, but I also level on my own.

Interested in a **Diablo IV** playthrough and another **V Rising** story. Enjoyed **V Rising** and played with someone, but I haven't heard from them in two months. Recently bought **Valheim** as well. 

I can adapt to your preferred gaming schedule. Own my own business and work from home, so *my schedule is open*. Don't mind streaming single-player games as well. Have a gaming buddy that I stream **Yes, Your Grace** weekly. So that said, I'm playing **Neon Abyss**, and **Digimon Story: Time Stranger**, but again, I've got several games if something calls to you. Can also stream anime or sports. If you're interested in watching football with muah, or hockey. 

Anyway, shoot me a DM. Gender is irrelevant; it isn't, but I don't have a problem with whatever gender you are. Age, just 21 and above. Also, disclaimer, I curse like a sailor.",1,1760559447.0,GamerPals,1,1.0,False

I live in a rural town in mexico and we get regular power outages. I am starting an online contract job where I will be working 20-30 hours a week in zoom meetings so I think I need to buy some type of external power source for if there is a power outage that I can still get to a meeting. Does anyone have any suggestions?

some additional considerations: if there is something solar powered that would be great as there is a lot of sun here. I also have had times where the power is out for multiple days so ideally it would be able to work for multiple days if necessary until maybe I can go to another town. also if it's portable to charge and needs to be plugged in- ideally something I could carry if I need to go to another town to charge it at a coffee shop or something?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Blues vs. Blackhawks: A Tale of Sieves, Siegels, and Surprising Synergy**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a hockey clash that’s equal parts *“will they, won’t they?”* and *“oh no, not again.”* The St. Louis Blues (-235) host the Chicago Blackhawks (+195) on October 15, 2025, in a Central Division showdown that’s less “gladiators in the colosseum” and more “two broken sieves arguing over who’s leakier.” Let’s dissect this with the precision of a Zamboni and the wit of a sarcastic linesman.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Game Feels Like a Math Class

The Blues are favored by 1.5 goals, but their goaltending is a statistical disaster. Jordan Binnington, their starter, has a 3.50 GAA and .860 save percentage—numbers so porous, even a *coffee filter* would blush at the comparison. Meanwhile, the Blackhawks’ new first line of Andre Burakovsky, Colton Dach, and Connor Bedard has sparked life into Chicago’s offense. Burakovsky, after a slow start, has averaged a point and two shots per game over his last three, while Bedard’s “anytime goal” prop is as reliable as a vending machine in a hospital.

The key stat? The Blues rank in the bottom half of the league in expected goals against per 60 minutes (xGA/60). Translation: Their defense is like a team of overconfident magicians—*“Hey, I’ll block that shot!”* *“No, you’ll let it in, and then cry.”*

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Chemistry, and the Art of the Comeback

The Blackhawks’ recent games have been a masterclass in *“almost good enough.”* They lost to the Panthers, Bruins, and Canadiens by a combined four goals but showed flashes of brilliance. Their 3-2 OT win over the Utah Mammoth? A microcosm of their season: gritty, chaotic, and occasionally glorious. Wyatt Kaiser leads the team in ice time and shot attempts, while Jason Dickinson’s 69.13% expected goal share is like a math teacher who *always* gets the right answer—even when the student doesn’t.

The Blues, meanwhile, are riding a 2-1 start fueled by Jimmy Snuggerud’s two-goal heroics against Vancouver. But here’s the rub: Their defense hasn’t improved, and Binnington’s save percentage is worse than a toddler’s attempt to build a sandcastle during a tsunam

i got my first job a month or so ago, i work at a small coffee shop which doesnt get a lot of traffic, and my salary is calculated by the daily sales percentage. so far i have the biggest sales but it still ranges around 3-4k hryvnias daily, and i get around 5% as a bonus to the base pay rate. also i often have encountered unsafe situations because of intoxicated customers, drunks, people on substances, whatever

my max salary, working 15 shifts a month, is around 13k hryvnias, which is roughly around $300. i work 12 hour shifts, the entire commute takes me around 2 hours a day, and preparing work space for the day (restocking, etc.) takes me around 1 hour. so overall, im away from home around 15 hours a day. that money isnt enough to live by at all, unless i destroy my health, but i dont really plan that, as im already beginning to feel the exhaustion catching up

so, there's an offer lingering that would be available around half a month later if not a bit more. its a job at a bar, and it pays twice as much, has 11 hour shifts and the owner gives you a ride home since you clock out at 23:00. it sounds really good and, as i have to move out, it would be more reasonable to try it out, but i cant help feeling guilty for wanting to switch jobs after only a month of working at the small business 

should i stay or take the offer? i dont want to seem like a jerk to the owners, they're good people ",1,1760559331.0,careeradvice,1,1.0,False
