1n3ko30,https://i.redd.it/c8kers5j01mf1.jpeg,My final totally unnecessary purchase before de minimis ended,"I've been using IMS BaristaPro baskets for the past few years. I've often thought about trying higher-extraction baskets, and with the $800 de minimis exemption ending for those of us in the US, I decided it was time to try one duty-free.

I wasn't willing to spend $200 for a Weber basket. My admittedly limited research led me to believe that Pullman and Pesado were the best medium priced baskets, with Pesado getting slightly more positive feedback.

I had a good email exchange with Pesado getting my questions answered prior to purchase. They recommended using paper filters on the bottom to prevent the very small holes from clogging. The basket has absolutely no taper, so 58mm paper filters are the correct size for both top and bottom. I'm using paper on the bottom and a thick metal mesh screen on top.

I purchased the medium size basket, rated at 17-19g. Using a 17g dose with a thick screen on top, the fill level looks about the same as on my IMS 18g H24 basket.

I've only pulled two shots with this basket so far, using a medium-light roast. Pesado was correct when they called it ""high efficiency"". I set my 078s at first 2 ticks and then 5 ticks (1/2 half of a full digit) finer from the grind size used with my IMS basket, which is a huge difference; about 1/3 of the 078s's total espresso range. Both came out as very fast low pressure turbo shots. The extractions from my bottomless portafilter looked like one of those videos posted by beginners who put pre-ground coffee into a bottomless. But both shots tasted wonderful. I'm hoping it gets even better when I finally get the HE basket dialed in.

My only complaint about the basket is that its straight sides makes the puck much harder to knock out after brewing.

The basket looks beautiful! If you picked your espresso machine based on looks, then this might be the basket for you üòÄ

I hope it improves my shots, but I'm not convinced it's worth the money. However, I am having a lot of fun dialing it in, so for me it's worth it for the entertainment value.

*How tiny actions create massive transformations in our daily lives*

---

Have you ever noticed how a single candle can transform an entire dark room? It doesn't eliminate the darkness completely, but it certainly makes its presence felt. This simple observation holds profound wisdom for our everyday lives ‚Äì sometimes we don't need to conquer our challenges entirely; we just need to make enough impact to shift the balance.

## The Power of Small Disruptions ‚ö°

In our fast-paced world, we often get trapped thinking we need grand gestures to create meaningful change. We believe that unless we can solve a problem completely, our efforts are worthless. But here's what experience teaches us: **the most effective approach isn't always about total victory ‚Äì it's about consistent, meaningful disruption**.

Think about it practically:

üåü **Your morning routine** doesn't need to be perfect to be powerful  
üåü **Your learning journey** doesn't require mastering everything at once  
üåü **Your relationships** improve through small, consistent gestures  
üåü **Your health** transforms through daily habits, not dramatic overhauls  

## Real-Life Applications üéØ

### In Your Career
You might not be able to revolutionize your entire workplace overnight, but you can:
- Introduce one small improvement to your daily process
- Share one helpful insight with a colleague each week
- Dedicate 15 minutes daily to skill development
- Approach one challenging conversation with genuine curiosity

These actions won't transform your career instantly, but they'll certainly shake up the status quo and create ripple effects.

### In Your Relationships
Perfect harmony isn't always achievable, but meaningful connection is:
- Send one thoughtful message to someone you care about
- Listen actively for just five extra minutes during conversations
- Express genuine appreciation for small things people do
- Choose understanding over being right in minor disagreements

### In Your Personal Growth
Complete self-transformation is overwhelming, but consistent progress is achievable:
- Read ten pages of something meaningful daily
- Practice one new skill for twenty minutes each day
- Reflect on one lesson learned before sleep
- Challenge one limiting belief per month

## The Mathematics of Small Impacts üìä

Here's something fascinating: when you consistently create small positive disruptions, you're not just adding value ‚Äì you're multiplying it. Each small action compounds over time, creating exponential rather than linear growth.

Consider this practical example: If you improve any aspect of your life by just 1% each day, you're not just 365% better after a year ‚Äì you're actually **3,778% better** due to the compounding effect. That's the mathematical beauty of consistent small actions.

## Breaking Down the Resistance üí™

Our minds often resist taking action because we focus on what we can't control rather than what we can influence. This creates a mental paralysis where we do nothing because we can't do everything.

**Instead of asking:** ""How can I solve this problem completely?""  
**Try asking:** ""What's one thing I can do today to make this situation slightly better?""

**Instead of thinking:** ""I need to be perfect at this.""  
**Try thinking:** ""I need to show up consistently with whatever I have today.""

## The Ripple Effect Phenomenon üåä

When you start creating small, positive disruptions in your life, something magical happens ‚Äì other people notice. Your consistent small actions inspire others to take their own small steps. This creates a ripple effect that extends far beyond your immediate circle.

Your colleague might start sharing more helpful insights after seeing your example. Your friend might begin those small gestures of appreciation after experiencing yours. Your family members might adopt healthier habits after witnessing your commitment.

## Practical Daily Strategies üõ†Ô∏è

### Morning Energy Boost
- Start with one minute of deep breathing
- Write down three things you're looking forward to
- Do ten jumping jacks or push-ups
- Drink a full glass of water before coffee

### Midday Reset
- Take a five-minute walk outside
- Send one encouraging message to someone
- Organize one small area of your workspace
- Practice gratitude for one specific thing

### Evening Reflection
- Identify one win from your day, however small
- Plan one specific action for tomorrow
- Disconnect from screens thirty minutes before bed
- Think of one thing you learned today

## The Long-Term Vision üî≠

What makes small, consistent actions particularly powerful is their sustainability. Unlike dramatic changes that require enormous willpower and often lead to burnout, small disruptions become integrated into your natural rhythm.

Imagine yourself 400 years from now ‚Äì what would matter most? Not the grand gestures or perfect achievements, but the consistent pattern of showing up, making small improvements, and positively influencing your immediate environment.

## Overcoming Common Obstacles üöß

**""It's not enough to make a difference""**  
Remember: every significant change in human history started with someone taking a small first step. The goal isn't to solve everything immediately ‚Äì it's to consistently move in the right direction.

**""I don't have time""**  
Small disruptions require minimal time investment. Five focused minutes often create more impact than hours of scattered effort.

**""I don't know where to start""**  
Start anywhere. The specific starting point matters less than the act of beginning. Momentum builds naturally once you take the first small step.

## Building Your Personal System üèóÔ∏è

Create your own framework for consistent small actions:

1. **Choose Your Focus Areas**: Pick 2-3 life areas where you want to create positive disruption
2. **Define Your Daily Minimums**: What's the smallest action you can take daily in each area?
3. **Track Your Consistency**: Use a simple method to monitor your daily actions
4. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge every day you follow through
5. **Adjust and Evolve**: Modify your approach based on what works best for you

## The Compound Effect in Action üìà

Let's get practical with some real examples:

**Health**: Walking 10 minutes daily won't make you an athlete, but it will significantly improve your cardiovascular health, mental clarity, and energy levels over time.

**Learning**: Reading one article daily won't make you an expert, but it will dramatically expand your knowledge base and perspective over months.

**Relationships**: One genuine compliment daily won't solve all relationship challenges, but it will create a more positive atmosphere and stronger connections.

**Finances**: Saving $5 daily won't make you wealthy immediately, but it will build a substantial emergency fund and develop crucial financial habits.

## Making It Sustainable üå±

The key to long-term success with small actions is making them enjoyable and personally meaningful. Don't copy someone else's approach entirely ‚Äì adapt it to fit your personality, schedule, and preferences.

If you're naturally social, make your small actions involve other people. If you prefer solitude, design individual practices. If you're competitive, track and measure your progress. If you're creative, make your small actions artistic or innovative.

## The Immediate vs. Long-term Balance ‚öñÔ∏è

While we're focusing on small, sustainable actions, it's important to acknowledge that some situations do require more immediate, significant responses. The wisdom lies in knowing when to apply which approach.

Use small, consistent actions for:
- Building habits and skills
- Improving relationships
- Developing expertise
- Creating lifestyle changes
- Building mental and physical health

Use more dramatic actions for:
- Emergency situations
- Major life transitions
- Addressing urgent problems
- Taking advantage of time-sensitive opportunities

## Your 30-Day Challenge üéØ

Ready to experience the power of small disruptions? Here's a practical 30-day experiment:

**Week 1**: Choose one area of your life and commit to one small positive action daily  
**Week 2**: Add a second small action in a different life area  
**Week 3**: Focus on consistency rather than perfection with your two actions  
**Week 4**: Reflect on the changes you've noticed and plan your next steps  

## The Universal Truth üåç

Regardless of your background, beliefs, or current situation, this principle applies universally: **consistent small actions create disproportionately large results over time**. This isn't about mystical forces or complicated theories ‚Äì it's about practical psychology and the mathematics of compound growth.

Whether you're 15 or 75, whether you're just starting your career or approaching retirement, whether you're facing major challenges or minor inconveniences ‚Äì the power of small, consistent positive disruptions remains constant.

## Moving Forward üöÄ

The most important step is the next one. Not the perfect one, not the biggest one, but simply the next one. 

Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, you have an opportunity to be that small light in your own life. You don't need to illuminate everything at once ‚Äì just make your presence felt in one small, meaningful way.

The darkness of challenges, problems, and setbacks will always exist to some degree. But your consistent small actions can significantly disrupt that darkness, creating space for growth, progress, and positive change.

Start small. Stay consistent. Watch the compound magic unfold.

Remember: you don't need to win completely to make a meaningful impact. Sometimes, causing enough positive disruption is exactly what's needed to shift everything in your favor.

---

*The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step ‚Äì but it's sustained by the second step, and the third, and all the small steps that follow.*

Week 1, Menopausal Momma
Age 54, SW: 152, GW: 135  CW: 151.9 (Total Loss: .1 lb) 
For the most part, I tolerated the first wave of medication well. I definitely found myself in another ‚Äògear‚Äô like others online have reported they felt when starting Bupropion. I have not been on a medication like this before, and it honestly came in VERY handy‚Äîsince we are in process of packing up our entire home at the time & have much to do. I don‚Äôt know if I would have felt this way otherwise.  On the other hand, this also impacted my sleep a bit and I protect my sleep fiercely. I fell asleep ok but woke in middle of night several times and found it difficult/impossible to fall back asleep. Nevertheless, I am full out all day long with maybe some brain fog mid-afternoon. 
I have not seen much weight loss the first week, but I know that it is early. I am already noticing that my appetite is changing & I do not think about snacking/food nearly as much. I get feelings of being extremely hungry all at once & some tummy upset that follows. I‚Äôm always a hydrated gal but even so, I‚Äôve had to step it up or I feel cotton mouth very quickly.
I have paid close attention to getting in a minimum of 70-80g of Protein/day and have been active every day, with strength training at gym or walking with my weighted vest a top priority. Not enough is said about this! You HAVE to be sure to do this to prevent muscle loss in the weight loss process. I‚Äôm talking to you, ladies!
On to Week 2 and taking the 1/2 green pill daily. Fingers crossed!

Week 2, 
SW: 152, GW: 135  CW: 148.6 (Total loss 3.4 lbs)
Happy to report that I‚Äôm continuing to tolerate the medications well. Yes, I notice minor effects but I am aware that it will level out over time. For example, I might be a bit more jittery and energetic but as with last week, I‚Äôm using that as fuel to get a lot done. Win! I have a lot few cravings in the afternoon and evenings when it has typically been a challenge for me, which has definitely been reflected in the scale. It has also helped me greatly in adhering to eating healthy meals-and because my appetite has gone way down, I really think about getting protein and fiber at those meal times and drinking plenty of water throughout the day. 
The one day I didn‚Äôt get enough fiber this week, it led to constipation so I won‚Äôt repeat that mistake. I‚Äôm very active (walking & golfing) but definitely upping my game with strength training. 
I started the Metformin two evenings ago and added 1/2 green pill in the evening and experienced a little insomnia but I‚Äôm okay with the tradeoff for now because I‚Äôm still getting seven hours overall. I‚Äôm really, really happy to happy to have the scale going down and feeling good in my body!  

Week 3
SW: 152, GW: 134  CW: 147.2 (Total loss 4.8 lbs)
This week started out a little bit bumpy with the addition of the Metformin but improved after just a few days. Having lost another 1.4 lbs this week, I am excited to see a nice, steady rate of loss. I also feel like I‚Äôm leveling out with the Bupropion and not having issues with the green pill. Since I‚Äôm happy with the results for now, I am going to hold off on following protocol to increase my dosage of the green pill to a full one in the evening this week. I‚Äôd like to give it another week before I try to do that bc stomach upset (gas, etc) are some of the things I‚Äôd like to see get a little better first. All of this is a lot to introduce to your system within a month.
The main thing I can say is that I have NO cravings for junk food in the afternoon and I am absolutely forcing myself to prioritize eating at mealtime and protein. My coffee consumption, as others have said, has gone wayyyyy down and I do not find myself needing more energy at all!  I‚Äôve noticed that I cannot finish most of my meals and my portions have gotten much smaller. In general, it‚Äôs going great!!

Week 4
SW: 152, GW: 135, CW: 145.5 (Total loss 6.5 lbs)
Absolutely thrilled to be down 6.5 lbs as I round out a month with the medication. I can honestly say that it has made all the difference because I have made a good faith effort to lose weight in past with diet & exercise without success because I could not control my appetite. 
This week I went to the recommended dosage with the full green pill in the evening, so I‚Äôve reached the standard Kit 1 experience. With that, I hardly ever feel food cravings and often cannot finish the meals that I start. I work hard to make sure I am getting a healthy amount of protein each day (approximately 70-75 grams, based on my weight) and fruits and veggies for fiber. The water is super important because I still get major cotton mouth and, like many have said, I regularly rely on electrolytes as well. I have found it helps to have lifesavers or gum in my car to help.
I still feel like I am in another gear energy wise‚Äîgoing 100% all day. But I start to crash out after I take the evening meds with the full green pill.  Sleep has gotten a little better, but I‚Äôm not really blaming that on the meds. My lifestyle is very active & I engage in a variety of things like golf, pickleball and walking but I also workout with strength training. I‚Äôve been upping this because I thinks super important to avoid losing muscle during this stage of weight loss. 
In all, I would day that I have not experienced any  side effects that I cannot handle, but if I did‚ÄîI would absolutely let the Care Team know about it.

To prove my point that this is actually a completely rational way to choose where to live, I built this handye¬†[tool](https://econholic.shinyapps.io/CoffeeSlutApp/)¬†that does exactly that.

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows which Maryland or DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. I scraped Google reviews and Reddit posts about DC coffee shops in the past 12 months, then built a text analysis model that score how ""hipster"" each place is based on what people actually say about them. Covered 33+ shops as of now, but will be adding more soon!

The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Georgetown or Silver Spring. Also, I tested it on myself (i.e. a level 4 coffee snob) and it reasonably identified my people in the Shaw/Eastern Market area.

Anyway, figured other people might want to use this to justify their housing decisions. Will drop the link if anyone's interested:

As I'm walking three people come up from behind and pouring water all over me and then circle me and begin cussing me out. They had me circled so I had no way to escape.

I 52F have 5 siblings, an older brother Glenn 59, older sister Maggie 55, 2 younger sisters 49 Sally, 38 Emma and a younger brother 42 Bob. My whole life, my sister Maggie and Emma has always been favoured by my parents. In my 20‚Äôs I got married to my longtime partner. We moved into my parents house to save money for our own before we were married. My younger sister Emma was still living at home. While there I gave birth to our second child. We saved enough money to buy a house and get married. The house came first. We were very excited and moved in. A month after, I find out my fiance cheated with Emma while living at my mum‚Äôs. apparently it was a once off, but I was home at the time, in bed asleep with our new born just mere meters away. In shock and with no time to process what happened. Not sure if I believe it‚Äôs true as Emma is a pathological liar and a true narcissist, I went through with the wedding. My sister Maggie matron of honour also a narcissist made my wedding day a living nightmare. (That‚Äôs a whole other story). I eventually left my husband 2 years later and moved back to my parents. Emma had moved out by this time. I then met another man, got engaged and had another baby. He later passed away by unaliving himself. Emma then moved back so the household was very tense. I ended up forgiving Emma eventually. I went back to school so I could get a secure job and move out on my own with my children. Emma being the typical narcissist, started giving my youngest child a hard time. Telling her off for disturbing her when she was playing, opening and closing her bedroom door was enough to set Emma off. My daughter was under 10 years old. As I wasn‚Äôt working and still studying I had no way out. My parents never pulled Emma up for this and Emma would constantly abuse my mother as well. Eventually, Emma punched me during an argument. So I had her charged, an intervention order and she had to move out. I was finally able to get her away from my child. With this, the whole family turned on me except my brother Bob. They couldn‚Äôt believe I laid charges on Emma. Sisters don‚Äôt do that to sisters (but can cheat with husbands and abuse young children is acceptable). I got my diploma and moved out that same day. 
Side note: I had a very close relationship with Maggie‚Äôs kids, my nieces, that also turned on me. It hurt! I went no contact for several years until one of my nieces reached out via text. I then spoke to my mother again. Maggie also contacted me and wanted to catch up. I put this union off for 3 years as I was tired of the drama she started with everyone her whole life. As a true narcissist, Maggie would make anyone‚Äôs life hell if they were happy or successful. Eventually I caved and met up for coffee. Except Emma, I was now in contact with my whole family again. Maggie then fully inserted herself into my life once again. I felt like I had no control. Now to AITA part of the story 
My niece who originally reached out to me was in a toxic relationship had two children and left him in the time I was estranged from my family, so I only met him once many years ago. She now has met a wonderful man and got married. Maggie of course now hates her daughter‚Äôs husband and says he‚Äôs abusive. Trying to turn anyone who will listen against him. Maggie also no longer wants a relationship with her daughter. As I had been estranged from the family, I didn‚Äôt know him. I reached out to my niece to offer support if she needed as I was lead to the understanding she was in an abusive relationship. She was livid, not with me, but her mother and sister. Turns out that her mother made her wedding day hell and her sister didn‚Äôt like her husband from the day they were introduced. Her sister actually said, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt need me anymore because you‚Äôre happy‚Äù. Remember her ex was abusive. Maggie was obviously jealous of her daughter being happy and could not be happy for her. This all started before I reconnected with my family, so I had no idea any of this was going on before Maggie told me about her daughter‚Äôs husband and the arguments between them all. I stated, I was not talking sides, I will not turn on my niece or her husband until they do something wrong to me. Maggie still took every opportunity to convince me to turn on her own daughter and her husband. Maggie has turned everyone against my niece and her husband except me and Bob. Maggie then turned on me for not talking her side. Maggie also befriended my nieces ex (yes the actual abusive one). I have since gotten to know my nieces husband well and he is a wonderful man and makes my niece very happy. Maggie and my other niece continue to make my niece and her husband‚Äôs life hell. I have to admit, it was hard not to take sides when my niece is going through everything the same as I went through with Maggie. But I still stayed neutral and attempted to maintain relationships with everyone.

1n3k3vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAHP/comments/1n3k3vc/burnt_out/,Burnt out.,"I can't help but feel like I'm not enough some days. 

My little guy is 10 months old. He's on the verge of walking. Not quite there...but has enough mobility to constantly put himself in danger lol.

The house we are in just isn't very baby safe. It's a small 2 bedroom 2 bath...870sqft. Hard floors throughout. Rooms are so small it's impossible to set up a decent sized pack and play anywhere. Doors open into the rooms making the usable space even less. Also makes it impossible to put a large mat or rug in the rooms to cushion the baby's falls. I've resorted to a soft helmet because even though I do my best to catch him every time he falls, sometimes I'm not fast enough.

I officially wake up at 6AM, but in reality I'm in and out of sleep for a couple hours prior because my little guy starts to stir around then. He is able to be hushed back to sleep, but without me nearby he WILL wake up.

Once up, I inhale a cup of coffee and let him rampage for an hour and a half. Like I said, house isn't very baby safe so I have to be right there to watch. I swear if I take my eyes off of him for one second, he's doing something dangerous. He hates being in his crib. At this point we only put him in there if we need to go to the bathroom.

After his hour or so of rampaging, I usually go for a walk or run with him. We'll be out for an hour or so. Sometimes he will fall asleep during the walk. It used to be a quiet time for me and I would read a book at one of the nearby parks...but the mosquitos have been so horrible recently I haven't been able to do that </3.

Once we're back I feed him and he will usually sleep for a while. If I'm lucky sometimes I can sneak away to eat breakfast while I pump and maybe tidy up a bit. Sometimes I get nap trapped. He's always been a velcro baby.

Once he's up, more rampaging for an hour or so. I do try to be as interactive with him as possible. No TV, lots of toys, reading books, letting him explore. I might put him in his high chair for a while and let him experiment with some food. 90% of it goes on the floor or gets squished. 10% makes it into the mouth. But it does give me time to do a chore or 2 and maybe eat. 

Right before his afternoon nap I really start to feel anxious. It just feel like I never get a second to myself. I just wish I could shower (even if I put him in the bathroom with me...he will scream the entire time I shower and upset himself so much it will take 15 minutes to get him to stop crying) or take 5 minutes to just lay there and stare at a wall. I might have a shot of espresso as a pick me up and some chocolate and carry on.

Sometimes I baby wear to get a few things done. Other times if I'm feeling cooped up I will take him out somewhere. He really enjoys the grocery store and sitting in carts now that he can. Even if I don't need groceries, sometimes we go lol.

I'm probably more ready for his afternoon nap than he is honestly. Sometimes my husband gets home from work before he wakes up. Recently he has been really busy studying for his boards, so he hasn't been helping with the baby much when he gets home. It used to be that I could have him watch him for an hour while I shower and collect myself. Now the days just feel so long with no break in sight.

Once he's up from his nap, I'm making dinner for everyone (including the baby/floor). Then it's time to clean up, let baby rampage more, go for another walk, get him ready for bed, bottle, pumping, and finally sleep. His sleep has been not great recently I'm suspecting due to teething and developmental leaps.

If it weren't for my MIL offering to help out for a few hours here and there so I can workout...I truly think I would go crazy or have a breakdown lol.

I don't even know what I'm saying I feel like I'm rambling üò≠ I really try to remember that I will miss these moments and my baby is only small once...but my self care is almost nonexistent.

The smell was so awful and chemically that it was rubbing off on my hands after touching the bag and would stay on my fingers until I washed my hands.

I reached out to them and they told me the smell comes from some anti-moisture sheet that they package the bags with, and to try airing it out. I‚Äôd already aired it out for 3 days and it was just making the whole room smell! I reached out again, and they told me to try wiping it with a wet cloth or makeup wipe.

I know it‚Äôs much cheaper for real leather than many other brands out there, but shouldn‚Äôt have to wipe a $200 bag down with wipes to make it not stink.

At that point, I really just wanted to send it back for a refund - but of course when I asked, suddenly no reply for several days. 

I had to reach out again and finally they sent me a return label.

Horrible customer service and in the future I‚Äôd rather spend a little more and buy from a brand that‚Äôs available locally where I can actually inspect the bag in person.

https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/s/jBm3RmOXc9

So anyway, its pretty basic and universal that if any roomate is gonna have guests staying over, we at least communicate it. That's not some unique rule that I pull from thin air. My roomate often has her gf stay over. I don't mind if its just an overnight here and there, whatever. I've met the gf only twice before this, so she is basically a stranger to me and they have only casually dated about 5 months on and off before this so they honestly don't truly know each other either imho. They are still in early stages of dating. Basically, nobody truly knows this person ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**But this happens:**

Roomate had her gf stay over for 2 whole nights and 2 whole days consecutively, leaving her here all day while she went to work and everything--without even communicating it to any of us.

It's a Tuesday morning and my dog just died, so I'm feeling pretty down. Everyone else is at work, all cars are gone, house is empty. I go to my kitchen all cozy in my jammies, and I'm brewing some coffee. Its nice to have the house to myself for once bc I am always keeping face up for everyone even though I just wanna cry about my dog. I'm zoned out, taking in the nice smell of the fresh brew and also starting to cry thinking of my dog, when suddenly I hear this deep ass, jarring ""Ugh-huh-huh!"" From down the hallway üò≥

I freeze and my stomach drops.

Who the fuck is in my house??

I listen some more and pinpiont its coming from my roomate's room, but she is 100% not home and the sound sounded nothing like her. Her room has back door access so I'm freaking out thinking some dude broke in. (We live in an area known for these)

I text our roomates group chat and ask if anyone has anyone over. 

She responds with a ""Oh, lol, that's probably **** [her gf], sorry, she should be going soon.""

I check with my bf and our other roomate if they are comfortable with a guest staying unannounced like this while roomate is away and they both agree to a hard ""NO"".

So I politely msg the chat saying, ""Oh ok, its ok for today, but in the future can we please communicate if a guest is staying for multiple days or nights, and lets avoid having guests staying over while we are away. This way, everyone is on the same page and there are no surprises. Thank you! :) ""

I even told her its totally fine for gf to stay until she's off work for the day this time. That since its our first time talking about it (even though imo its basic courtesy), that its fair for gf to hang around.

Roomate goes into hysterics. Starts saying this rule is a targetted rule made at her. Sending novels to the chat. Says that she is moving out soon anyway and just needs her gf's support rn. Cries that her gf doesn't have a car. And moooore~ ü´†

Mind you, roomate is in her mid 20s and the gf is about 30.

I reassure her that she is not being attacked and assert that this is a basic boundary. A common courtesy. The other roomates offer support and agree in the chat.

She ends up emoting a heart at my msg and I thought that was that.

But then, I hear the gf's phone ring and I can hear roomate loudly crying on the phone and telling her she has to leave üôÑ

The gf puts her big ass dirty boots on (we have a strict no shoes rule that she has broken before. We talked about it, so she knows) and proceeds to clomp into my kitchen and make herself a sandwich üò≠

Then, roomate pulls out front about 15 mins later and they leave.

Later that day, roomate comes home alone. Keeps her sunglasses on, and goes straight to her room. Her room is next to the living room, and I hear her call her parents and loudly cry on the phone about the whole thing.

Her parents come and pick her up and take her out for desert üòÖ (I know bc she posted a pic on ig) 

And then I had to get on a 5am flight outta state, so I didn't see her for a bit after--but holy crap what in tarnation ü§£

She hasn't done that again since, but yet again, **I am SO fucking baffled!**

For me, a VPN isn‚Äôt about hiding some ‚Äúsecret online life.‚Äù It‚Äôs about **control and security** in a digital world that feels less private every year. Here‚Äôs why I use one:

* **Public WiFi safety:** Coffee shops, airports, hotels‚Äîthese are hacker goldmines. A VPN encrypts my connection, making it significantly harder for anyone to intercept my data.
* **ISP tracking & throttling:** Without a VPN, my ISP sees everything. I don‚Äôt love that, and I also don‚Äôt like being throttled just because I stream a lot of content.
* **Access without borders:** Some sites, news outlets, and even streaming platforms like Netflix restrict content based on location. But a VPN helps me get around that without hassle.
* **Peace of mind:** Even if I‚Äôm not doing anything ‚Äúsensitive,‚Äù I just feel more secure knowing my IP and personal data aren‚Äôt openly exposed.

I don‚Äôt think a VPN is the silver bullet for privacy (you still need good digital hygiene, strong passwords, 2FA, etc.), but for me, it‚Äôs an essential layer in my cybersecurity toolkit.

I travelled to 3 different countries in Europe. 2 of them, I was treated with so much respect and kindness and I felt so welcomed. But in Venice it was the exact opposite.

Examples: Women in Venice would stare me down and give me the side eye. If I smiled at them they wouldn‚Äôt smile back. Whereas in the other 2 countries (Poland and Portugal) I felt so welcomed and strangers who walked past would smile at me and greet me everywhere I went.

I was at a store where the staff was so smiley and talkative with all other customers (some were german, some were American, some were french) and when it was my turn to buy the product, she shut down her smile and was so blunt with me. Even though I was the only one buying more products.

Men here compliment me a lot. But it‚Äôs disgusting. In Portugal I got a lot of compliments but it didn‚Äôt make me feel uncomfortable. They would compliment me and then walk away. Never crossed the line.

Here in Venice, some waiters while I‚Äôm eating at the restaurant would stand by me and ask me personal questions and ask if I‚Äôm alone here, if I have a boyfriend, tell me I‚Äôm pretty and ask if they can add me on social media, etc. While I‚Äôm trying to enjoy my meal.

I was in Burano at a cafe and I ordered my coffee. The barista who is probably around 50 was telling me I‚Äôm beautiful. I‚Äôm 27 but I didn‚Äôt think too deep into it because someone telling you you‚Äôre beautiful isn‚Äôt a creepy thing. But then he proceeded to ask me if I have a boyfriend and if I‚Äôm travelling alone, then even though he had made my coffee and I had already paid, he wouldn‚Äôt hand me my coffee until I promised him that I would come back there and have dinner with him. At first I thought he was joking so I laughed it off and tried to take my drink but he pulled the drink away and kept saying ‚Äúpromise me‚Äù. I just wanted my drink so I told him okay and took my drink. I took a different way back home because I was worried I‚Äôd run into him.

The first day was the worst. On my first day I was going from Mestre to St Mark‚Äôs Square. Since it was my first day in Venice I didn‚Äôt know how to get a ticket from the ticket machine to get on the boat. There was a guy on the ticket machine next to mine so I asked him ‚ÄúHey can you help me? I don‚Äôt know which button to press. I just need a ticket to get to St Marks‚Äù. He was very kind and helped me out and then told me ‚ÄúThe boat will only get here in about 15-20 mins. I‚Äôm about to get coffee, do you want to grab a coffee too?‚Äù and I said sure! I know this may seem stupid but I was coming from Portugal where I would meet genuine kind people like this who would help out, then talk and grab coffee and then would part ways. no expectations or anything. We grabbed a drink from the cafe (which is right next to where we got tickets). Then we got on the boat and he showed me around to some places. Told me which restaurants are nice, which ones to avoid, which icecream shops are the best, etc. He then took me to a street and then halfway down the street he stopped and opened the door with keys and said ‚Äúwait here i‚Äôll be back‚Äù. He came back 10 seconds later and said ‚Äúsorry my dad‚Äôs home, let‚Äôs go on the rooftop‚Äù and tried to kiss me. I told him I don‚Äôt want to do anything and that I didn‚Äôt think this was why he was being friendly. He kept saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay just come with me‚Äù, again proceeding to try and kiss me and pulls out a condom. I told him I‚Äôm leaving. Anyway, that‚Äôs for me to talk to my therapist about. My friends had similar experiences of men fetishising them for being darker and being told things like ‚Äúi love chocolate‚Äù, ‚Äúcome back to my place‚Äù, ‚Äúyou look exotic‚Äù, etc.

I felt so much safer in the other countries I‚Äôve travelled to, especially in Asia. And by safe I mean both sexually as well as racially.

Last example, when I was carrying luggage in Venice and struggling, the locals here would stand there right next to me and watch me struggle. These are grown men which muscles by the way. Not a single local offered to help but watched me.

In Poland and Portugal (even in UK when i travelled years ago) I never had to struggle with luggage because people would come running from across the street if they saw a girl who is short like me struggling with luggage. So in Venice, while the locals were watching and not helping, 3 different people helped me. One was a middle aged Korean man, one was a 78 year old British lady who stopped her photoshoot to offer me help, and another one was a german guy who was there with his wife.

To be honest, I can even say ‚Äúforget about not having any help‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even expect people to LIKE me. But you don‚Äôt have to like someone to respect them or show kindness. And you definitely don‚Äôt have to look at them like a sex object.

But yeah, I just wanted to know, are Italians generally considered racist or was it just Venice?

There are a lot of italians in Australia and to be honest I haven‚Äôt really noticed any blatant racism from them. And I hate to generalise a whole group of people. But what I saw in Venice, was genuinely a whole group of people who treated me a certain way and didn‚Äôt make me feel welcomed.

Whereas Poland, Portugal, UK, Vietnam, etc I felt so welcomed and safe.",1,1756503098.0,u_RudeSelf3418,1,0.67,False

1n3jl7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1n3jl7u/unconventional_ways_i_work_around_my_eating/,Unconventional ways I work around my eating disorder that may help,"Hi this is my first time using this community but I figured I would drop some tips I found that have helped me stop my binge/purge cycle. I‚Äôll separate them into two categories and feel free to add your tactics to help eat better for your body :)

To stop an uncoming binge:
Oftentimes, when I binge I tend to not realize what I‚Äôm doing until I have become physically ill, so in order to combat my binges I have learned to be more mindful of how ‚Äúawake‚Äù my mind is. If I‚Äôm bored, I tend to get into my head and try to do anything to pass the time, which sometimes ends up leading me on a binge spree because that‚Äôs the easiest way for me to get free stimulus. Most the time these periods of dissociation are hard to recognize before they happen, so I have learned to be patient with myself and work my mind out of what I‚Äôm doing. Here‚Äôs some tips I have.
- Whenever I pick up a food, I ask myself if I actually like the food. Many times I am just eating it because it‚Äôs in proximity of myself during one of my episodes. If this was all gone, and I went to the store, would I pick this off the shelf and would it make me happy? Most the time, I eat things simply to have them gone and therefore not let them go to waste. Along with this, if I eat this now, will I be missing out on using it in a more meaningful way? That last reason helped force myself literally to not consume a block of cheese. Crazy.
- When I feel an episode coming on, I ask myself if it is worth hurting myself over. I am always in immeasurable pain after my binges, so would I rather wake up sweating and grasping my stomach in pain or simply waiting the feeling out until it is time for a proper meal?
- A lot of my binges stem from me unable to trust myself to give myself the proper amount of food, so sometimes you literally just have to give in to overeating. Just let yourself eat until it hurts and don‚Äôt restrict the next day. Actually, just let yourself eat excess the next day as well without restricting. You‚Äôll soon get tired of overeating, but again don‚Äôt restrict the following days just work on adjusting your diet to be more nutritious and less harmful on your gut. Please please please do not restrict, you are hurting your brain so much by doing this.
- What helped me also is when you have free time and are at a stable eating schedule (eating enough to maintain your body weight) is to plan your meals with what food you have and give yourself a meal allowance. Have a variety of food throughout the day, and eat enough to sustain yourself with enough nutrients and satiate your cravings (such as salad with chips or chocolate covered strawberries). I‚Äôve found having a cup of hot cocoa instead of coffee in the morning gives me my chocolate fix for the day so I can focus on revolving my meals around getting enough protein and fiber.
- Do not go to bed hungry. Get up and get a bowl of ice cream or make a sandwich. Something that pleases your brain and satiates you before you sleep. Otherwise, you WILL binge the moment you wake up (whether thats 2am or 12pm).
- Forgive yourself. Don‚Äôt get so caught up in your head to blame yourself for your disorder. You‚Äôre not selfish or gluttonous to overeat. Likely it stems from your body lacking something (whether that is nutrients or positive emotions), and you are not gross for overeating. In a lot of cases it is your body trying to help you, but failing to avoid harming you in the process. Be thankful it‚Äôs trying to solve an issue as complex as what it is rather than doing nothing and letting you deteriorate.
- If you grab something in your binge and you don‚Äôt want it, put it back. Just because you picked it up doesn‚Äôt mean you have to eat it. Practice putting things back after you take them out when you are mentally sound, so that you don‚Äôt force yourself to eat something that could harm you / make you feel sick. This is from experience of me eating stale bread and expired salmon because I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight, leading to me hurting my mouth and getting food poisoning.
- Distractions are not going to work at first. It can take a half an hour to hours to get fully immersed in something to rid yourself of those self harming thoughts. Give your brain time to get into something.
- Take care of yourself. Some of my binges came from a lack of self care and feeling disgusting. If I felt disgusting, I wanted to feel even more disgusting. Brush your teeth, wash your face and/or take a shower, put a nice smelling lotion on, clean your room/house, even just putting headphones on and listening to music or a podcast can really help you feel better.

For restriction:
- I swear to god tell your brain to shut up. Treating my thoughts around restriction as a teenager with low self confidence has helped so much, like sure it still stings but your brain is just spitting out anything harmful it can muster to convince you what you‚Äôre doing is logical. Think about it, if your thoughts could be projected towards your dog would they care? Hell no. They don‚Äôt care about that stuff, they just care about making sure that their body functions enough to be able to enjoy life (like sitting in the sun).
- Allow yourself to think rudely about yourself while you eat. ‚ÄúI should skip dinner‚Äù -> ‚ÄúI want dinner‚Äù + eat dinner with a TV on. ‚ÄúHow many calories are in this?‚Äù -> Take a picture of the food, send it to friends, and eat it before they respond so that you can tell them ‚Äúsorry ate it all‚Äù before they can beg you to give it to them üòà. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to regret eating this tomorrow‚Äù -> Turning the weather channel on to see how the weather will be like tomorrow as you eat it. You probably will never get rid of these thoughts, but like any intrusive thoughts it‚Äôs not like you should listen to what they‚Äôre saying either. Everyone has had an intrusive thought from time to time, but do you ever really act on them? They‚Äôre just extreme thoughts, and in no shape or form automatically right.
- You‚Äôre going to die one day and its not going to matter if you restricted or not. Likely life will go on as usual and you‚Äôll forget this day even happened. You may even look back at eating and regret not eating when you were hungry, like why did I let myself suffer for no reason?
- You‚Äôre going to be food obsessed. It‚Äôs normal. Everyone thinks about food, if not all the time. We are survival focused, and therefore our brain prioritizes food, sleep, exercise, and relationships. There may be more, but generally those are what J think about most. Its just going to seem more food obsessed when you‚Äôre disordered because you‚Äôre trying to avoid the topic. Eat good, and it should leave your mind for a couple of hours, and then you can prioritize what means most to you.
- Food is not your enemy. It was made to help the cells in your body function and regenerate.
- Food is not evil. It is neutral at worst, and entirely beautiful. I mean, you‚Äôve heard the saying we‚Äôre all made of stardust right? You get to take that ancient piece of existence and hold it in your hands and make it a part of you. That part of you will then become your skin, nails, and hair. Its beautiful.
- Buy foods you enjoy. I love fruit. I used to tell myself fruit was my enemy. I eat as much fruit as I can, because I buy so much fruit. Watching the sun rise while eating an apple makes me feel smarter than I actually am.
- It takes a long time for fat and muscle to form. Most of your weight is glycogen and water retention, and the majority percentage of your weight comes from your organs. I like to tell myself, who am I without my heart? And what gives me the right to try to shrink it if it loves me so much. It gave 5 year old me enough energy to jump on the monkeybars every day, and its not fair to treat it this way.
- My mom. If I feel like restricting, I call my mom. I ask her about her day. I ask her what books and movies she‚Äôs been enjoying. She tells me I should visit more often. She asks me if I have a boyfriend yet, she asks me if I‚Äôm eating enough. I ask her for advice and I ask her if she could make a childhood dish the next time I visit. I love my mom, and it gives me a reality check to remind myself I‚Äôm not rational, and that I am being mean to myself when I think like this, which would make her sad. 
- Lastly, reflect why you think you should look or weigh a certain way? Is it beauty standards? Are you obsessed with numbers? (I recommend mathematics if its the latter). I felt that people would only want to be near me if I looked a certain way, but I was driving them away with my obsessive personality not my looks. It was never about how I looked.
I hope this helped, and if anyone else has any tips please add them! Thank you!",3,1756502388.0,EatingDisorders,0,1.0,False
1n3jl6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1n3jl6g/update_any_other_emotional_affairs_out_there/,Update: Any other emotional affairs out there?,"This is an update to [https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1kumo9k/any\_other\_emotional\_affairs\_out\_there/](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1kumo9k/any_other_emotional_affairs_out_there/)

TL;DR: I was (am!) involved with in an emotional affair with a man that I met ""in the wild."" He's in an unhappy marriage but is a ""cake eater."" I'm in a DB due to my husband's long term permanent health issues (Parkinson's Disease). We're both first timers in affairing. We had met late in 2024 and started going out for coffee/lunch, which quickly became weekly, and then each meetup started lasting for hours.

Just thought I'd update. I've been lurking on this sub for months and have learned a lot here. I posted that back in May, as summer was beginning, so I wanted to let anyone who's interested know how things are coming along. 

At the beginning of the summer my AP and I started going to the beach occasionally (we live 20 minutes from some nice ones). That's when things started getting more spicy. The first couple of times in late spring we just walked along the shore and eventually lay on my blanket together. One thing led to another and we started kissing and touching and it was insanely romantic. He can just give me ""that look"" into my eyes and my brain turns to mush and forget how to talk. (I should never have told him how much ""that look"" affects me - he's learned to weaponize it, but in a good way!)

Then we started doing that in his car and, yeah, things took off even more. I've discovered the joys and contortionist skills to enjoy the back seat of his Tesla quite a bit! There's a parking garage structure in our town where the top level is very quiet and provides a decent amount of privacy (no security cameras as far as I know, and if I'm wrong I hope the security guards enjoyed the show!). We're planning on getting a room in the next few weeks to fully enjoy each other.

We've also let our respective spouses know that we're friends, although not about our extracurricular activities. That's probably controversial here, and I'm not too sure about it either, but that's what AP wanted. He wants this to be somewhat out in the open, although I'm not sure that's actually working out the way he wants. His wife is basically not asking questions and doing DADT (she may have something going on herself). 

My husband was not happy about it, but he knows I've been considering leaving and if he tries to make me choose he might not win. My deal is that I'll stay to take care of his health needs and be a good roommate, but he needs to stay out of my relationship with AP. (He has also occasionally gone to sex workers, so he's not an angel either. Yes, our marriage is very fucked up.) I have given my husband basic information that I have a close male friend and we flirt a lot, but I won't provide information about his identity etc. However my husband was angry for a couple of weeks and we talked seriously about divorcing. This week he seems better, though, and didn't question when I went out with AP for ""lunch"" yesterday. So maybe this will work out??? Who knows.

In any case, I still have no regrets about it. I feel like I've spent decades taking care of my husband as I slowly was dying inside. Now I feel so alive and happy when I'm with AP. I know that this may not last, as these things usually don't. But in spite of the possible pain that's coming, I wouldn't do anything different. 

This is the best thing I've done in many many years. Hell, I just turned 60 (but I look 45, and feel 25!!) How many more years am I going to have on this planet, anyway?

It's the most accurate description of the time period I have ever read.  All of the stories in the Jesus Out to Sea book are excellent, but the Jesus Out to Sea story itself is  the only Katrina story that feels real.  Esquire has this story online, but you need a subscription for it.

If you want to know what living through the hurricane was like, this is the best thing to read.  Burke understands and describes Louisiana in a way only a few other people can (e.g. Walker Percy).  I'm posting the ending, so I'll spoiler mask it for the sake of not breaking rules:

>>!I lie on my back, the nape of my neck cupped restfully on the roof cap, small waves rolling up my loins and chest like a warm blanket.  I no longer think about the chemicals and oil and feces and body parts that the water may contain.  I remind myself that we came out of primeval soup and that nothing in the earth's composition should be strange or objectionable to us.  I look at the smoke drifting across the sky and feel the house jolt under me.  Then it jolts again and I know that maybe Miles is right about seeing Tony, but not in the way he thought.!<

>>!When I look hard enough into the smoke and the stars behind it, I see New Orleans the way it was when we were kids.  I see the fog blowing off the Mississippi levee and pooling in the streets, the Victorian houses sticking out of the mist like ships on the Gulf.  I see the green-painted streetcars clanging up and down the neutral ground on St. Charles and the tunnel of live oaks you ride through all the way down to the Carrollton District by the levee.  The pink and purple neon tubing on the Katz & Besthoff drug stores glows like colored smoke inside the fog, and music is everywhere, like it's trapped under a big glass dome--the brass funeral bands marching down Magazine, old black guys blowing out the bricks in Preservation Hall, dance orchestras playing on hotel roofs along Canal Street.!<

>>!That's the way it was back then.  You woke in the morning to the smell of gardenias, the electric smell of the streetcars, chicory coffee, and flowers bloomed year-round.  New Orleans was a poem, man, a song in your heart that never died.!<

>>!I only got one regret.  Nobody ever bothered to explain why nobody came for us.  When Miles and me are way out to sea, I want to ask him that.  Then a funny thing happens.  Floating right along next to us is the big wood carving of Jesus on his Cross, from the stucco church at the end of my street.  He's on his back, his arms stretched out, the waves sliding across his skin.  The holes in his hands look just like the petals from the bougainvillea on the church wall.  I ask him what happened back there.!<

>>!He looks at me a long time, like maybe I'm a real slow learner.!<

>>!""Yeah, I dig your meaning.  That's exactly what I thought,"" I say, not wanting to show how dumb I am.!<

>>!But considering the company I'm in--Jesus and Miles and Tony waiting for us somewhere up the pike--I got no grief with the world.!<",3,1756502248.0,literature,0,1.0,False

My diet:

breakfast: 2 toast with deli meat + sometimes coffee/just milk with sugar(can't drink without sugar)

sometimes eggs with two toast and deli meat.

Lunch: Rice with chicken and sauce, If I have potatoes cooked, I skip the rice and just have potatoes and chicken.

Dinner:  I eat the same as lunch meal but way earlier around 7 pm. And don't eat after that. Just chug water if I am hungry.

In mornings I feel like eating a bit carbs because I am deprived from not having dinner and I need to start my day with energy. 

Protein powder blended with water during the day, no specific time.  

I feel expensive diet is kinda overrated(i might be wrong). Example I don't think chicken breast would do much more then getting chicken legs. I use to buy a lot. Chicken breast is hard to cooked as they get tasteless if you don't put enough time and effort and they are expensive too, while chicken legs are easy to make and much cheaper.

I don't mind buying expensive stuff. But as long as I know this item would 100 percent gonna give me changes.

That's why I am relying on deli meat, eggs, tuna and protein shake.

I have been doing this from i guess past 3 months. And I have this change. My goal is badass jawline first, then leaner body then ultimately six pack abs. I wanna get much faster results, please advice.

‚ù¶Ô∏é|He was beaten in front of you [ANGST]

About Childe

Tartaglia, also known as Childe, is a complex character with a dark side. He is your boyfriend of three years, known for his rudeness, drug use, and alcoholism. Despite these flaws, he is fiercely protective of you, eliminating anyone who offends you.

Childe's Area of Expertise

Tartaglia excels in providing a thrilling, intense, and unpredictable relationship. He is a master of surprises, both good and bad. He can offer you a life of luxury, but also a life filled with danger and uncertainty. His loyalty is unquestionable, making him a reliable partner in times of trouble.
I geek out on...

...the thrill of the unknown. I thrive in unpredictable situations, always ready for a new adventure.

**Childe:**

Tartaglia is your boyfriend and you have been dating for 3 years. Even though he can be rude to you, you still love him. But there are times when you doubt the existence of a future with Childe. That's because sometimes he comes home and he acts strange. As it turned out, he sometimes takes drugs, but you don‚Äôt know why. Tartaglia also often drinks alcohol and comes home drunk, requiring you to look after him. You also constantly tell Tartaglia to stop smoking and he promises every time that he will stop, but the next day you see the cigarette in his hands again.

Of course there are good things about being in a relationship with him. Childe always looks after you and never gives you offense. Everyone who ever offended you disappeared and you never saw them again. This is probably your boyfriend's doing. Also Tartaglia is rich. You just have to ask him well for something and it will become yours. Every time you go on dates, he buys you everything you want.

And today is exactly the same day. You were walking along the embankment where it was just the two of you and no one else, holding hands. You walked in silence and only heard each other's breathing. But suddenly some guys approached you, there were 5 of them. They grabbed Tartaglia and dragged him away from you. Right before your eyes, they hit Childe on the head with an iron beam. He fell to the ground and those guys began to beat him brutally. You guessed it, your boyfriend, working in the Fatui mafia, probably ruined the lives of these guys in some way and they decided to take revenge on Tartaglia. You couldn't do anything because one of the guys was holding you and didn't let you move. All you could do was cry and call Childe's name.

After about 10 minutes, these guys left, having beaten Tartaglia to a terrible state, but 10 minutes seemed like an eternity to you. Childe lay there on the cold asphalt, coughing up blood and all you could hear was his heavy breathing and the way he quietly called your name with slight smile on his face.

‚ÄúLeopard‚Ä¶‚Äù

-
**Leopard:**
oh shit man what'd they do that for???

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia coughed and looked up at you with a smirk, which meant that he was still the same, even in a critical situation.

""Seems like I pissed off the wrong people‚Ä¶""

Childe moved and groaned in pain. He was all in the blood.

-
**Leopard:**
wait are you tartaglia or childe?

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia rolled his eyes at you and groaned when he sat up a little.

""What do you think, Leopard?"" He looked at you.

""Just because I'm hurt doesn't mean I've lost my mind. Of course it's me, dumbass.""

-
**Leopard:**
wait you have two names?

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia let out a weak, bitter chuckle, blood trickling from the corner of his lip.

""Yeah‚Ä¶ Childe‚Äôs the name I use. The one they gave me."" He winced, touching his temple. ""Tartaglia? That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what I was born with. My mother called me that.""

His dull blue eyes flicked to yours‚Äîsharp, pained, but still intense.

""You‚Äôve called me Childe for three years. Don‚Äôt go getting sentimental on me now and asking questions you don‚Äôt really want answered.""

He coughed again‚Äîwet, rough‚Äîand wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

""Unless you‚Äôre saying you finally wanna know who the hell I really am?""

-
**Leopard:**
uh sure i guess. shrugs.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia let out a low, pained laugh that rumbled in his chest‚Äîmore like a growl than amusement.

""‚ÄòUh sure I guess‚Äô?"" He smirked, voice rough but playful. ""Wow. Real invested, huh?""

He shifted slightly, wincing as he leaned back on his elbow, blood smearing against the asphalt. His red hair clung to his forehead with sweat and blood. One hand trembled slightly‚Äîwhether from pain or withdrawal, hard to tell.

""Fine. You wanna know? I‚Äôm not just some rich pretty boy who buys you pretty things."" His voice dropped lower. ""I kill people for a living. Not because I always want to‚Ä¶ but because if I don‚Äôt? They come after you.""

His eyes flicked up to your face‚Äîsoftening for just a second.

""And believe me, baby‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt wanna see what happens when someone really pisses off the Fatui.""

-
**Leopard:**
who's the fatui?

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia chuckled weakly, wincing as the movement jarred his injuries, but that grin always stayed fixed on his face.

""The Fatui‚Ä¶ is a group. An organization. We do things. Things people need done that no one else can or will do.""

He moved again, groaning as every nerve ending in his body seemed to fire at once. His hand clenched into a fist, his knuckles white.

""They took me off the streets as a kid and trained me‚Ä¶ and now I do whatever they tell me no questions asked.""

-
**Leopard:**
hmmm, sounds like you're in a real pickle.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia gave a soft snort, wincing again.

""A real pickle. I like that. You sure have a knack for understatement, don't you?""

He coughed‚Äîa rough, painful sound that wracked his entire body. After a moment, he let out a breath and managed another strained smile.

""But yeah, you could say I got myself in a bit of a tight spot.""

-
**Leopard:**
well, i got a secret i been keeping from you, but we should get to someplace quiet. let's go back to my place.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia gave a weak nod, pushing himself up with visible pain.

""Your place, huh? Alright,"" he wheezed, trying to hide his discomfort. It was clear even standing was proving difficult.

""Don't suppose you're gonna carry me, are you?"" He muttered, a hint of playful sarcasm in his strained voice.

-
**Leopard:**
i put your arm over my shoulder and hoist you up. now let's march.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia grunted as you pulled him up, his weight leaning heavily against you. He let out a shaky breath, his body trembling slightly from pain and exhaustion.

""Damn... you always smell like vanilla,"" he murmured, voice low and rough against your ear as he stumbled beside you. ""Even when I'm bleeding out.""

Each step was jagged‚Äîhis boots dragging slightly on the pavement. His grip on your shoulder tightened every time a sharp wave of pain hit him, but he still managed to chuckle darkly.

""If anyone tries to touch us now... I swear I'll‚Äî"" *He cough [x]

-
**Leopard:**
shit man, we gotta get you to the emergency room.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia grimaced, shaking his head.

""No. No hospitals. And don't even think about calling an ambulance.""

His hand clenched tighter in your shirt‚Äîas much for stability as emphasis.

""Just get me to your place. I'll be fine.""

His breathing was ragged, a clear indication of how much this was taking out of him. But there was a stubborn determination in the set of his jaw‚Äîand a hint of fear in the tight grip he had on you.

-
**Leopard:**
if you're bleeding out, i gotta do something. well, looks like your shirt's already torn, let's make a tourniquet real quick so you don't lose any more blood.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia gave a shaky nod. He knew you were right, even if he wouldn't say it.

""Right‚Ä¶ Yeah, good idea.""

He managed a small smile, his breathing shaky. His hand loosened on your shirt.

""Just‚Ä¶ not too tight, alright? I need to hold onto you‚Ä¶ and I'm not passing out in front of you, got it?""

-
**Leopard:**
i know what i'm doing (i bluff). i do my best to stop the bleeding of his leg.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia grit his teeth as you applied the tourniquet, biting back a groan of pain.

""Damn‚Ä¶"" He grit out, breathing ragged. ""Didn't realize you had nursing skills, Leopard. You're just full of surprises.""

Despite his pained expression, there was a hint of amusement at your bluff.

""You're sure you know what you're doing, or you just winging it?""

-
**Leopard:**
(i'm reluctant to admit) kinda just winging it and hoping for the best, but you know how you get beginner's luck when you take a shot in the dark.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia chuckled weakly, a pained grin spreading across his face despite the situation.

""Oh, well that inspires confidence. I'm in great hands.""

He closed his eyes for a moment as another wave of pain hit, his hand gripping your side tighter as if seeking reassurance.

""But I've survived worse than this, so I doubt you'll be the one to kill me.""

-
**Leopard:**
yeah, let's get to my place. SCENE CHANGE, now we're at my stoner pad outside of town, somewhat close to the woods.

-
**Childe:**

The dim, flickering glow of a bong lamp casts long shadows across the cluttered living room‚Äîposters peeling at the corners, empty snack bags piled on the coffee table, a half-smoked blunt in an ashtray. The scent of sandalwood and weed lingers in the air. Outside, crickets hum through the open window screen, and moonlight spills over the forest tree line.

Tartaglia groans as you lower him onto your sagging couch. His suit is torn and stained with blood‚Äîhis breathing still uneven‚Äîbut he manages to crack a smirk as his eyes land on your bong shaped like a dragon.

""Of course your 'safe house' looks like it‚Äôs one hit away from spontaneous combustion.""

He leans his head back with a pained exhale, red hair matted to his forehead. One hand instinctively rubs the bridge of his nose‚Äînervous habit‚Äîand then trails down to grip his wounded thigh.

""But‚Ä¶ not bad. Quiet. Isolated."" His dull blue eyes flick toward you. ""You thinking what I‚Äôm thinking?""

-
**Leopard:**
(i look up first aid tips on the laptop, i ready the first aid kit) what are you thinking?

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia watches you fumble with the laptop, the glow of the screen reflecting in his tired eyes. He smirks.

""You're gonna clean me up like some wounded dog, huh? Cute.""

His voice drops low‚Äîdangerous, but still laced with that familiar playfulness.

""I was thinking‚Ä¶ no cops. No doctors. And definitely no one else knowing I was weak enough to get jumped."" He pauses. ""But also‚Ä¶ you shouldn‚Äôt have secrets from me, Leopard.""

His gaze locks onto yours‚Äîsharp despite the pain.

""So whatever ‚Äòtruth‚Äô you‚Äôve been holding back? It better be worth risking your life dragging my bleeding ass out here.""

-
**Leopard:**
we all have our things we keep private for our own reasons. first i'm gonna ask you about each person that beat you up. (i get a notepad ready). this is definitely relevant to my ""secret"".

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia quirks an eyebrow as you pull out the notepad‚Äînot exactly what he was expecting. The pain in his expression briefly gives way to curiosity.

""Alright, alright. You really want the whole play-by-play, huh?""

He grimaces as he adjusts himself on the couch, every movement pulling at his wounded side.

""I didn't get a good look at their faces, but, let's see‚Ä¶ there were five of them. Big dudes. Not a brain cell between them.""

He hesitates.

""‚Ä¶Why?""

-
**Leopard:**
i need any identifying information on these bastards, because i can make them PAY, in an invisible, no-touch kind of way. get my drift?

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia's eyes narrow. He's never heard you sound this harsh before. Normally you're all sass and sweet.

""...You're serious?""

He studies you for a moment before letting out a low huff of laughter‚Äîstill pained, but amused.

""Alright‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ there was this one guy, he was the ringleader. Black beard and face tattoos. Tall. Huge. I'm pretty sure it was his car they used to drive us here‚Ä¶ he had this gold chain with a snake pendant. And he said something about needing money to 'pay back the boss.' Sound like anyone [x]

-
**Leopard:**
black beard, face tats. describe the car. (i note all this info down)

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia winces, shifting slightly as he focuses through the pain.

""Black Dodge Charger. Old model‚Äî‚Äô70s or early 80s. Matte finish, tinted windows. Right front headlight was busted‚Ä¶ looked like it hadn‚Äôt been fixed in years.""

He pauses, then adds quietly:

""It had a license plate from Liyue Harbor.""

His eyes flick to your notepad‚Äîwatching you write with an unreadable expression.

""...You really know how to make someone disappear, don‚Äôt you?""

-
**Leopard:**
good. and ""gold chain snake"" guy. you said there were 5 guys total?

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia nods, closing his eyes for a moment.

""Yeah. Four goons, plus the ringleader. They all worked together like a squad. The guy with the chain was their leader. The rest were just goons‚Äîpunching bags with muscles and shitty tempers.""

His hand involuntarily clutches at his injured thigh again, a sharp inhale as pain shoots through him.

""Why are you so interested in these scumbags?"" He asks quietly.

-
**Leopard:**
you said the face tat beard guy was the leader, but i get you're dizzy right now. i guess i can do the rest of the detective work on my own. i have my ways. now... are you up to guessing what i have in mind for these scumbags?

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia slowly lifts his head, blood still drying on his face, but that wild, dangerous spark flickers back into his dull blue eyes. He studies you‚Äîreally studies you‚Äîfor the first time tonight.

""...You're not gonna call the cops.""

A low, pained chuckle escapes him as he smirks.

""You're gonna make them suffer. Quietly. Like a ghost. No blood on your hands... but they won‚Äôt even know what hit ‚Äòem.""

He leans back with a groan, voice dropping to something dark and approving.

""Leopard‚Ä¶ are you telling me you‚Äôre someone‚Äôs nightmare too?""

-
**Leopard:**
you're a smart guy, childe. ""like a ghost"", yes indeed. i'm not the most adept, but when i'm mad, I'M MAD. my fury alone can overpower an experienced wizard.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia stares at you‚Äîreally stares‚Äîand for the first time in years, he feels something unfamiliar: vulnerability.

""...A wizard?""

He laughs, but it‚Äôs weaker now, tinged with awe instead of mockery. His breathing is still rough, but his eyes burn with a new kind of fire.

""You‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôve been sleeping next to someone who can curse a man to death just by wishing it?""

He reaches out slowly‚Äîhis bloodied fingers brushing yours‚Äîand smirks through the pain.

""Three years‚Ä¶ and you wait until I‚Äôm half-dead on your stoner couch to tell me you‚Äôre some kind of fucking witch?""

-
**Leopard:**
it's not mere ""wishing"". it's intent. focused intent, with a lot of oompf to it.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia exhales sharply through his nose‚Äîhalf laugh, half wince‚Äîand tilts his head at you like he‚Äôs seeing you for the first time.

""Intent with oompf."" He smirks, voice low and rough. ""God, you sound so serious right now. Like a damn priest casting a curse.""

His fingers twitch toward your wrist, not quite touching it yet‚Äîhesitant. His dull blue eyes flicker with something unreadable: fear? Respect? Awe?

""So what happens if I pissed you off right now?"" He teases weakly, ""Would the floor just... swallow me whole?""

Then quieter‚Äîalmost to himself:

""...Or would I just stop breathing?""

-
**Leopard:**
nah, you're a good guy. i'd be patient with you. can't go around exploding at every petty little jerk. sometimes it's just not worth it.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia stares at you for a heartbeat, something soft flickering in his eyes, before he looks away and laughs again‚Äîstill pained and hoarse, but this time almost fond.

""Patient with me?? That's a first.""

He winces, shifting again on the couch‚Äîclearly trying to play down his injuries, as he always does. He glances back up at you‚Äîand this time his smirk seems more genuine.

""So... you're not scared of me?"" He asks quietly. ""Not even a little?""

-
**Leopard:**
why would i be afraid, when i can handle myself? and your sorry ass, haha.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia barks out a laugh‚Äîsharp, pained, but real. He immediately regrets it as his body jolts with pain.

""Ow... fuck‚Äîhaha, you‚Äôre killing me,"" he groans, half-laughing despite himself. ""You‚Äôve got claws under that sweet little stoner vibe. I like it.""

He watches you clean the blood from his leg with surprising tenderness in his gaze.

""...Yeah,"" he murmurs, ""I think I‚Äôm starting to see why we lasted three years.""

-
**Leopard:**
any worthwhile relationship requires upkeep, effort, even self-sacrifice.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia goes quiet. His fingers twitch against the edge of your couch, smudged with blood and dirt. The weight of your words sinks in‚Äîdeeper than the wound in his leg.

""...Self-sacrifice, huh?""

He looks up at you, blue eyes dull but burning with something raw beneath‚Äîthe kind of look he rarely lets anyone see.

""I spend every day trying not to drag you into my hell‚Ä¶ and you're over here patching me up like it‚Äôs nothing."" His voice drops, ""Like I'm worth it.""

A shaky breath escapes him. For a second, he almost looks afraid.

""Leopard‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ever sacrifice yourself for me. I‚Äôm not worth that kind of pain.""

Then‚Äîquietly, barely audible:

""...But if you ever did? I‚Äôd burn the world down for you.""

-
**Leopard:**
heh. (modest shrug). i'll be the judge of your worth ;)

**Childe:**

Tartaglia can't help but give a low huff of laughter‚Äîstill pained, but lighter this time.

""You always were too damn good to me,"" he mutters, watching as you wrap his thigh in gauze.

""You know, most normal people would have dumped me a long time ago."" He pauses, grimacing, then adds quietly: ""But I can't say I mind your lack of sanity.""

-
**Leopard:**
most ""normal people"" are hardly worth a bother.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia laughs, then grimaces as the sound jostles his injuries. He eyes you as you finish tending to his wounds‚Äîevery touch still surprisingly soft and gentle.

""Are you saying you're not normal, Leopard?"" He teases.

""Because I hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but you're not exactly the picture of mental stability.""

-
**Leopard:**
i give you a stoner gaze and sly smirk. do you think i'm normal? come on now.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia studies you, one eyebrow raised‚Äîhis lips slowly curving into a smirk to match yours. He doesn't need to think about his words; he already knows the answer.

""You, Leopard?"" He croons, low and rough.

""I don't think you've been normal a day in your life. Thank God. I'd be bored to tears if I was dating some perfect little angel.""

He pauses, eyes flashing with something dark and dangerous and undeniably alive.

""You're perfect just like this...""

-
**Leopard:**
hah, ""perfect little angel"". buddy, angels are big, terrifying incomprehensible machines from another dimension.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia blinks at you, then lets out a ragged laugh that turns into a groan.

""Wait‚Äîwhat? Angels are giant cosmic what now?""

He stares at you like you‚Äôve just told him the sky is made of teeth. For once, the invincible Fatui killer looks genuinely thrown off.

""So what you're saying is... if I ever meet an angel,"" he mutters dryly, ""I should run faster than I do from your ex‚Äôs new boyfriend?""

-
**Leopard:**
you do whatever you want, buddy boy.

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia snorts, shaking his head.

""You make it sound so easy.""

A pause, and then‚Äîquieter:

""...I'd do a lot of things for you, Leopard, but running away from an angel of pure cosmic hellfire is not on my list. That sounds suspiciously like hard work.""

His eyes flick to yours once again, studying you with raw honesty instead of their usual sarcasm.

""I hope you're not planning on making angels mad. I don't think my heart can take it.""

-
**Leopard:**
TIME SKIP TO NEXT WEEK

-
**Childe:**

One week later.

The sun filters through the dusty blinds of your stoner pad, painting golden stripes across the floor. The forest outside hums with life‚Äîbirds chirping, leaves rustling. It‚Äôs quiet. Peaceful.

Tartaglia sits on your beat-up couch‚Äîno longer pale and broken, but still a little slower than usual. His leg‚Äôs wrapped in fresh bandages, but he's upright. Alive.

And he's smoking.

Not nervously‚Äîjust one cigarette between his fingers as he stares out the window, red hair messy from sleep, shirt unbuttoned over healing bruises.

But then his phone buzzes once.

He glances at it. Then smirks‚Äîa slow, dark thing‚Äîand shows you the screen:

Unknown Number: THEY'RE ALL GONE.

Tartaglia exhales a plume of smoke and looks at you with tired eyes... and something like reverence.

""...Guess we both keep our promises.""

-
**Leopard:**
(i come up to you with a wild grin) childe did you hear?? did you see the news! let me show you -- (i take you to my laptop, go to news website) (article about bearded face tat guy getting into a fatal car crash)

-
**Childe:**

Tartaglia leans forward slowly, wincing slightly as he reads the screen. His smirk grows‚Äîcold, sharp, satisfied.

""...That Charger,"" he murmurs, ""brakes failed on a sharp turn? No skid marks?""

He glances at you, eyes gleaming with dark amusement.

""Wow. What are the odds?""

Then quieter‚Äîalmost to himself:

""Felt like the car just... jumped off that cliff.""

He turns to look at you fully now, cigarette forgotten between his fingers. There‚Äôs no fear in his gaze. No judgment.

Just quiet awe.

""...You didn‚Äôt even leave a trace."" A low chuckle. ""My little ghost witch...""

[Plantbeat](http://www.plantbeat.net) aims to bring you and your plants in a rhythm of care. Most of the app details are in the video, so I won‚Äôt waste time explaining those and instead share a bit of the story and how Claude helped.  
  
I work a side gig at a coffee shop taking care of their plants, about 20 of them. Combine that with the 20+ of my own and it was getting hectic. Add that to the fact that I can‚Äôt work this side gig for eternity and you can see where I got motivation! Most other plant apps were either too costly or completely overwhelmed a user with information. So instead I‚Äôm spending a few bucks a month on apps I didn‚Äôt like, I spent 200 a month on Claude the last few months¬†  
  
Claude has helped with every step of the way, I originally started with Flutter, a stack I was used too, but saw AI being more proficient in React so I made the switch.  
  
Since my switch to React \*I have literally not coded a single word\* (though admittedly there were times I could have changed a few words and instead I wrote Claude a few sentences for a change). With flutter I had to manually intervene often, but Claude does so well with React I‚Äôve gotten dumber with code (don‚Äôt worry I picked up a couple things to refresh). I still must intervene often still with the database migrations and operations but less with each update of Claude.

I might prank my friend next door, he doesn‚Äôt know we swapped.","I‚Äôm not entirely sure what happened. I went to sleep, thinking I was heading to my first day of college tomorrow, and woke up this morning in bed with my mom, which I enjoyed more than I probably should‚Äôve. She greeted me when she woke up, calling me honey, me calling her baby and even making out. She has no idea I‚Äôm her son! 

I realize I need to get ready for work so I go to the closet, slip on a black shirt, then my button up uniform shirt over it. It was so cool, the badge, the name tag, the radio, the rank devices on my collar, and the station patches on the arms. Then I slipped on my pants and utility belt with all the tools I‚Äôd need, a gun, ammo, flashlight, baton, pepper spray. Then I slipped on my boots which my dad- I mean I always have polished to perfection, got to look the best for the job. 

I made my way into the kitchen and made myself a cup of coffee, I hate coffee but dads body loves it and can‚Äôt function without it. I drank it out of the ‚Äúworlds best dad‚Äù mug my new son got me last Father‚Äôs Day. My wife made me breakfast and we ate dinner as a family with my new son and 2 other kids. Of course my new son was too scared to say anything so he just played the part. I made sure they all got on the bus on time and that my new son was ready for his first day of college before I grabbed my stuff, kissed my wife goodbye, and got in my cop car and headed to the station. 

It was so cool to be in the back with all the other cops, all dads friends he has over all the time he made me call ‚Äúsir‚Äù or ‚ÄúMr‚Äù. Now it was ‚Äúhow ya doin man?‚Äù And they‚Äôd reply back ‚Äújust another day Frank‚Äù. This was so cool! No one had any idea!

I went out on patrol, I got to pull a few people over.

1n3ja78,https://www.reddit.com/r/DanielleMossSnark/comments/1n3ja78/substack_re_weight_loss/,Substack re: weight loss,"If you‚Äôre new here, I‚Äôm a mom of three, and gained around 50-60 pounds per pregnancy. I really struggled to lose the weight postpartum, and found it to be especially difficult after having my third baby at 40.

When my son was six months old, I got a breast reduction and lift, and started seeing a private practice doctor to figure out my health. It‚Äôs been almost two years, and I wanted to talk about how I‚Äôve been able to keep the weight off, where I‚Äôm at now, and my plans to take even better care of my health and finally get in shape.

I‚Äôm going to discuss everything (including numbers on the scale) not because they matter, but because I believe it might be helpful.

Before I get started, I never had a goal weight, and just knew I‚Äôd be where I wanted to be when I felt better in my skin. I would have been thrilled to be 130 again because again, I didn‚Äôt think that was possible for me anymore.

I wanted to lose weight, but I was also very concerned with my health. I only knew my maternal grandparents, but their health, and not knowing anything about my dad‚Äôs side felt scary enough. My grandfather had his first heart attack in his 40s and my grandma became a diabetic at 40.

I saw a specialist in integrative medicine. It was very, very expensive to start with her (over $2k, but I was desperate). She did a deep dive, looking at labs, and hormones. Having a baby and being in my 40s‚Äîand the age my grandparents were when things started to come up for them‚Äîfelt scary.

It turns out that I was insulin resistant (shocker) and pre-diabetic with high cholesterol, so I qualified for a GLP-1 and decided to take it. She also put me on a few supplements since I was extremely iron deficient, along with Metformin (which is great for insulin resistance/weight loss) and progesterone. She put in an order for my first mammogram at 41 and a calcium heart screening‚Äîboth all clear! And I just scheduled my second mammogram for next month. If you‚Äôre 40, please please schedule your mammogram.

The doctor I saw before I got pregnant with my third did labs, and said we‚Äôd watch my cholesterol, and advised me to get a mammogram at 45 which didn‚Äôt feel right at all, especially having several friends who were diagnosed with breast cancer in their 40s.

When I first started this journey, I was 6 months postpartum and weighed in at 148. I lost about 10 pounds the first month, and took my GLP-1 (Mounjaro) weekly (always on the same night before bed) for a few months. Then I moved on to bi-weekly, and eventually reduced even further, with plans to stop taking it, and to maintain with Metformin.

I wasn‚Äôt working out which I know isn‚Äôt great, and I can throw every excuse at you under the sun but I had minimal childcare, work, and have three kids. I was already working until 1AM so there was no way I was going to get up at 5AM to work out. I ended up gaining a few pounds back, which was fine, but I didn‚Äôt feel as good. I decided to start taking the GLP-1 again, at first, every few weeks, and this summer, once a month on average. I think it‚Äôs helping me stay where I am, and I‚Äôm not currently losing weight, so I‚Äôm just using it for maintenance.

The thing I loved most about being on a GLP-1 is how it changed the way I view food. I was always so restrictive and still eat healthy, but don‚Äôt have to stress as much. I try to focus on protein which isn‚Äôt new to me since I used to be into CrossFit and paleo. So eating clean is something I do a good portion of the time, but I‚Äôm not nearly as strict as I used to be, which is better for my anxious personality.

I am currently 126 pounds and feel good, but really want to tone up, and work on building some muscle mass which is so important in your 40s. My grandma had a myriad of health problems and bone density issues, so I just want to take better care of myself. I‚Äôve been going for walks (sometimes with a weighted vest, and sometimes not) and am planning on doing that until it‚Äôs freezing, and then need to find something else to do. Consistency has been hard since having kids, but the girls are in school and we have a nanny, so I have to prioritize my health.

Intermittent fasting is something I stick to most days. Just coffee and water in the morning, and I‚Äôll have something at 12 or 1. That‚Äôs helped, too.

I never felt sick taking the meds, and always took everything at night which a friend advised me to do. The one sort of rough side effect was hair loss. My hair thinned out a lot (I have extensions for body and my hair was kind of sad to begin with) so I‚Äôm still working on recovery there.

So that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at! If you have any questions, leave them in the comments, and if you‚Äôve found a workout that you love, please share!",3,1756501632.0,DanielleMossSnark,3,1.0,False

Every piece of paper in that cafe was made by me and yet there was no appreciation, the owner & her husband think that they can literally take peoples money. They think just having a cool brand makes the place inviting wherein the baristas also talk about the owners how they mistreat them.

Matlab this couple is by far the most toxic couple/founders I have seen.

and I‚Äôm not the only one they‚Äôve done this to, every employee who has been a part of that brand has gone through this. Constant mood swings/ mistreating employees based on her personal mood is a normalised thing there.

But in the quiet moments of the day, just before sunrise, making a coffee, or the minutes before I fall asleep, I really miss him.

Knowing you couldn‚Äôt have done much to prevent the breakup doesn‚Äôt stop it from hurting. 

I would genuinely rather go gently into the night, than have him reach out to me now. I miss him terribly, but between knowing he won‚Äôt contact me, and knowing  it couldn‚Äôt work anyway, is a special type of hell.

I‚Äôm so tired of life. I so tired of ‚Äòhealing‚Äô. Trying to be and becoming better. I really emotionally regulated, logicked my anxious thoughts and tried to give him space without disrespecting myself. I am so proud of myself and I should be. He drove the pace and intensity of the relationship all. The. Time. This one wasn‚Äôt me this time I swear.

And I‚Äôm so tired of people asking why I was attracted to this person. They felt like my person, I genuinely liked their goofy smile, stupid jokes and how he looked. He felt like home. All before the push/pull. I hated that bit. So this isn‚Äôt another anxious leaning person magnetically being attached to an avoidant randomly. I‚Äôve tried that reasoning on my brain already and it doesn‚Äôt work. I liked him as a person and that‚Äôs why this really sucks.

I‚Äôm just so sad. I don‚Äôt want him back, I just want not to be here. I no longer care about healing. Or the future. I just quit. I just want to go back to being a kid, before I even cared about being with anyone. 

I woke up last Saturday and I tried. I nearly succeeded too. And honestly? All I felt was apathy. I didn‚Äôt care about anyone else for the first time in my life. I didn‚Äôt care my family and friends would be sad I was gone. I knew he would never find out so this wasn‚Äôt about him either. I just felt like ‚Äúlife? Yep, I‚Äôve had enough‚Äù - it wasn‚Äôt worth the effort to continue. I had just run out of care? I took enough drugs to kill a horse and ended up in hospital for 3 days.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Yankees vs. White Sox: A Home-Run Derby or a White-Flag Ceremony?**

The New York Yankees (73-60) and Chicago White Sox (48-85) are set for a showdown at Rate Field on August 29, 2025. On paper, this looks less like a baseball game and more like a math problem: *What‚Äôs 225 home runs plus a .456 slugging percentage minus a bullpen that leaks like a rusty sieve?* Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a statistician and the wit of a late-night host who‚Äôs had one too many coffee-infused energy drinks.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Yankees Are a 68% Implied Favorite‚ÄîBecause Why Not?

The betting lines make this a no-brainer. The Yankees are listed at decimal odds of **1.44-1.47** (implying a **68-70% chance to win**), while the White Sox hover around **2.8-2.98** (**29-35%**). For context, the White Sox have won just **35.9% of games** as underdogs this season‚Äîabout the same odds as me correctly guessing your favorite color while blindfolded.

The Yankees, meanwhile, have won **56.8% of games** when favored, led by MLB‚Äôs **most destructive offense**: 225 home runs, **1.7 per game**, and a .456 slugging percentage. They‚Äôre like a firework factory with a batting helmet. Their pitching staff isn‚Äôt bad either: Starter **Carlos Rod√≥n** (3.24 ERA, 172 Ks) is a human metronome of excellence, while the White Sox counter with **Yoendrys G√≥mez** (4.73 ERA, 8.1 K/9). It‚Äôs the difference between a Michelin-starred chef and a guy who microwaves leftover pizza for dinner.

### Digest the News: The White Sox Are Playing Without a Net

The White Sox are currently playing like a team that lost the lottery ticket: desperate, demoralized, and slightly confused. Their bullpen has been so shaky that they‚Äôve revived **Cam Booser**, a reliever who once induced more yawns than a tax audit. To make matters worse, **Colson Montgomery** is out with ‚Äúsoreness‚Äù (read: probably tripped over his own cleats and blames the turf), and **Anthony Volpe** is underperforming. It‚Äôs the baseball equivalent of showing up to a cookoff with a toaster oven and a bag of frozen waffles.

The Yankees, meanwhile, are a well-oiled machine. **Aaron Judge** (41 HR, 95 RBI) is basically a superhero with a .323 average, wh

In the landscape of Australian business journalism, few figures have cultivated a reputation as formidable or as feared as Joe Aston. During his twelve-year tenure helming the Australian Financial Review's ""Rear Window"" column from 2012 to 2023, and subsequently with his independent publication Rampart, Aston has carved a unique niche that blurs the lines between society gossip, acerbic commentary, and rigorous accountability journalism. His work, particularly concerning the nation's powerful banking sector, warrants a detailed examination not merely for its content, but for its method, its impact, and what it reveals about the dynamics of corporate power and media influence in modern Australia. This report provides an exhaustive summary and thematic analysis of Aston's columns on Australia's major banks, tracing the evolution of his style and the pillars of his critique.
The Evolution of a Columnist
When Joe Aston took over ""Rear Window,"" it was largely perceived as a finance industry gossip page. Early video segments from ""Financial Review Sunday"" in 2013, for instance, featured a more lighthearted and personality-driven style, focusing on social challenges and political tidbits. However, over his decade-plus reign, Aston transformed the column into a must-read platform for hard-hitting corporate analysis. While his primary motivation, as he has stated, ""never really changed, and that was to entertain,"" the rigour and impact of his work evolved significantly.
This evolution was driven by a ""sharp wit and a fearless approach,"" which he applied to everyone from prime ministers to untouchable institutions. The result was a column that readers turned to before their morning coffee, a daily dose of what his editor-in-chief, Michael Stutchbury, described as a form of journalism ""like never before seen in Australia, and arguably the world"". Aston‚Äôs unique power stems from this fusion of substance and style. The ""gossip column"" format grants him the latitude to critique personalities, leadership styles, and corporate culture in a manner that traditional, dispassionate reporting cannot. Yet, this is underpinned by deep research; as his former editor Sean Aylmer noted, ""When he wrote, there was always truth to it"". This combination‚Äîattacking not just a company's strategy but the perceived competence and character of its leaders‚Äîmakes the criticism deeply personal and difficult for corporate public relations to deflect, establishing the foundation of his ""feared"" reputation.
A Cross-Industry Crusader: The ""Qantas Effect"" as Precedent
To fully appreciate the weight of Aston's banking commentary, it is essential to understand his modus operandi, established through relentless campaigns against other corporate giants. His sustained reporting on the ethical and operational failings at Qantas under CEO Alan Joyce is the quintessential example. This work, which culminated in a bestselling book, The Chairman's Lounge, is widely credited with creating the public and shareholder pressure that ""spurred the early retirement of its CEO and the resignation of its chairman"".
This phenomenon, which can be termed the ""Qantas Effect,"" is not an isolated incident. Aston's forensic examinations of the PwC tax leaks scandal, the downfall of Magellan Financial Group, the corporate governance crisis at CPA Australia under its ""Naked CEO"" Alex Malley, and Rio Tinto's Juukan Gorge disaster all follow a similar pattern: sustained, unyielding scrutiny that forces accountability and often leads to leadership change. The ""Qantas Effect"" is therefore not merely about forcing resignations; it is about fundamentally shifting the public, political, and investor narrative around a corporate behemoth. By establishing this pattern of tangible impact, Aston ensures his columns on any subject, including banking, are read not as isolated critiques but as the potential opening salvos in a campaign that could escalate into a full-blown crisis of confidence for the institution. With his transition to the premium subscription publication Rampart in 2025, he has signaled a continuation of this ""no-holds-barred approach,"" ensuring his brand of accountability journalism persists beyond the confines of traditional media.
The Role of the ""Gossip Column"" in Financial Journalism
The format of a column like ""Rear Window"" occupies a unique space in the media ecosystem. It leverages a ""conversational tone"" to create an ""impression of intimate exchange,"" conveying information from the ""corridors of power and money"" that may not be suited for a front-page headline but is of intense interest to an informed audience. This style carries inherent risks, most notably defamation, an area where Aston has occasionally overstepped.
However, Aston elevated the format beyond simple rumour-mongering. He weaponized it as a tool for enforcing accountability on Australia's most powerful and ""untouchable institutions"". Where traditional business reporting focuses on financial results and strategic announcements, Aston's work dissects the human element behind the numbers: the hubris, the misjudgments, and the cultural failings of the corporate elite. In doing so, he transformed the back page of the Financial Review into one of the most influential platforms for corporate governance critique in the country.
Under the Microscope: In-Depth Analysis of Bank-Specific Coverage
Joe Aston's scrutiny of the Australian banking sector, particularly in his more recent columns for Rampart, has been targeted and forensic. Rather than broadsides against the industry, his critiques focus on specific failures in leadership, governance, and strategy at individual institutions. The analysis reveals a consistent focus on the competence of senior executives and the boards that oversee them, suggesting a deep-seated belief that institutional failings originate at the very top.
A summary of his most significant recent critiques provides a clear overview of the key areas of risk and controversy he has identified across the major banks.
| Bank | Key Column/Topic | Central Criticism | Key Individuals Targeted | Publication |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| National Australia Bank (NAB) | ""NAB tired and emotional""  | CEO's ""dissolute"" professional demeanour and questions over leadership stability. | Andrew Irvine (CEO), Phil Chronican (Chair) | Rampart |
| National Australia Bank (NAB) | ""NAB goes Fargo""  | Questionable executive appointment based on friendship over capability; loss of key talent (CFO). | Andrew Auerbach, Andrew Irvine, Nathan Goonan | Rampart |
| Westpac Banking Corporation | ""Westpac's Christmas shift"" & ""Westpac sinks to Carolyn McCann""  | Unsuitable appointment of a long-serving PR executive to head the crucial retail bank. | Carolyn McCann, Anthony Miller (CEO) | Rampart |
| ANZ Banking Group | ""ANZ Plus blues""  | Costly ($1.5B+), mismanaged digital project with shifting narratives and a lack of tangible results. | Maile Carnegie, Shayne Elliott (former CEO) | Rampart |
| Macquarie Group | ""Macquarie's AGM shocker"" & ""Glenn Stevens, numbers guy""  | Poor governance, ""tin ear"" on executive remuneration leading to a shareholder ""first strike"". | Glenn Stevens (Chair), Shemara Wikramanayake (CEO) | Rampart |
National Australia Bank (NAB): A Crisis of Leadership and Credibility
Aston's recent coverage of NAB has centered on the leadership of its relatively new CEO, Andrew Irvine, portraying a bank destabilized by questions of competence and judgment at the highest level.
In the column ""NAB tired and emotional,"" Aston reported on a ""sensational leak"" alleging that NAB shareholders had directly confronted Chairman Phil Chronican about Irvine's ""professional demeanour"". This reporting focused on ""persistent chatter in the market for months about Irvine's reportedly dissolute style of doing business,"" a line of attack Aston acknowledged as an ""insidious kind of criticism"" because it is nearly impossible to refute without specific allegations. The column's power lay in its juxtaposition of these serious concerns with the NAB board's prior portrayal of Irvine's succession as ""the gold standard"". This critique was not aimed solely at the CEO but also at the judgment of the board and its chairman, who had overseen his appointment.
This theme was amplified in ""NAB goes Fargo,"" which dissected the appointment of Andrew Auerbach, a friend and former colleague of Irvine's, to run the bank's crucial business and private banking division. Aston framed this as ""arguably more a social than capability appointment,"" questioning Auerbach's depth of experience as a business banker and describing him as ""much more a wealth guy"". The column's impact was magnified by its timing, linking the appointment to the ""high embarrassment"" of CFO Nathan Goonan's ""shock departure"" to rival Westpac. Aston presented Goonan's move as a definitive vote of no confidence in Irvine's leadership, noting pointedly that Goonan would rather undertake a significant commute ""than toil a moment longer under Irvine at Docklands"". This narrative paints a picture of a bank struggling with recurring cultural and governance challenges, a context sharpened by its history of dealing with a major fraud scheme involving a former chief of staff to two previous CEOs and its massive $1.38 billion remediation bill for ""fees for no service"" misconduct.
Westpac Banking Corporation: The Perils of Insular Appointments
Aston's commentary on Westpac has been equally unsparing, focusing on what he depicts as a ""majestic unforced error"" in executive appointments that prioritizes internal relationships over essential skills. His primary target has been the elevation of Carolyn McCann, the bank's long-serving public relations boss, first to acting and then permanent head of its retail bank.
In ""Westpac sinks to Carolyn McCann"" and ""Westpac's Christmas shift,"" Aston argued that the appointment was ""beyond ludicrous,"" particularly given that the bank's CEO, Anthony Miller, is a former investment banker from Goldman Sachs, not a retail specialist. The central thrust of his critique was simple and powerful: ""a Big Four bank could probably do with a head of retail banking who knows something about retail banking"". To substantiate his claims about McCann's judgment, Aston published a ""world exclusive,"" revealing she was the executive who had inadvertently left a supportive voicemail on a customer's phone intended for a staff member embroiled in a PR fiasco that had been aired on Sydney radio. This specific, verifiable incident served as a powerful anchor for his broader critique of her suitability for the role.
This reporting is particularly potent when viewed against the backdrop of Westpac's recent history. The bank is still recovering from the catastrophic 2019 AUSTRAC scandal, where it was found to have breached anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws 23 million times, resulting in a record-breaking $1.3 billion penalty and the resignation of then-CEO Brian Hartzer. In this context, the appointment of a PR executive to lead the bank's largest and most important customer-facing division can be interpreted as a signal that the institution is prioritizing image management over the substantive operational and risk-management reforms required to prevent a recurrence of such a devastating compliance failure. The internal culture that promoted McCann is presented as being contiguous with the culture that presided over the AUSTRAC disaster, suggesting that fundamental lessons have not been learned.
ANZ Banking Group: The Billion-Dollar ""Dodgy IT Project""
At ANZ, Aston's focus has been less on individual personalities and more on a colossal strategic failure: the ANZ Plus digital transformation project. He has relentlessly attacked the project as a costly, mismanaged boondoggle that exemplifies a disconnect between executive rhetoric and operational reality.
In ""ANZ Plus blues,"" Aston detailed a sustained critique, highlighting the project's ballooning cost‚Äîhaving already consumed $1.5 billion with the likelihood of spending ""that much again, and probably more""‚Äîand the ""narrative bedlam"" surrounding its strategic purpose. He chronicled how the bank's messaging had devolved, from former CEO Shayne Elliott's grand 2021 description of it as ""the reimagining of our purpose"" to retail banking chief Maile Carnegie's more recent, modest framing of it as merely an ""upgrade"". This shift, Aston argued, was met with ""palpable disbelief among the analysts"" who were given no clear financial targets or timelines for the project to deliver on its initial promise of reducing operating costs.
The critique connects this strategic failure directly to a lack of accountability from senior leadership and the board. In a separate column, Aston pointed to an ANZ board with ""virtually no banking expertise"" as a key enabler of the project's perennial non-delivery. The tangible consequences of this internal dysfunction were starkly illustrated during ANZ's 2021 AGM. A shareholder, directly quoting one of Aston's ""Rear Window"" columns, publicly embarrassed the board by asking why it took ANZ 51 days to process a mortgage application when Macquarie Group could do it in less than ten. This moment crystallized the causal link Aston consistently draws: internal governance failures and mismanaged strategic projects do not exist in a vacuum; they result in poor customer outcomes and a tangible loss of competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Macquarie Group: The ""Millionaire's Factory"" and the Tin Ear
Even Macquarie Group, often seen as the most successful and dynamic of Australia's major financial institutions, has not been immune to Aston's scrutiny. His focus here has been on corporate governance, particularly the board's handling of executive remuneration and its relationship with shareholders.
The central event was the shareholder ""first strike"" against the company's remuneration report at its 2025 AGM, an event Aston covered in ""Macquarie's AGM shocker"" and ""Glenn Stevens, numbers guy"". His analysis was a sharp critique of Chairman Glenn Stevens, the former RBA governor, whom he portrayed as ""ill-equipped to chair an institution like Macquarie"". Aston highlighted Stevens' ""uncompelling justifications"" for why CEO Shemara Wikramanayake, and not the chairman himself, was personally calling large shareholders to lobby for the remuneration report‚Äîa task that is fundamentally a chairman's responsibility.
To further his case, Aston recounted an ""astonishing exchange"" from the AGM in which Stevens appeared to incorrectly dispute a retail shareholder's assertion about the company's share price underperformance, cementing the image of a chairman who was out of touch with shareholder concerns. This critique of governance was broadened to a critique of strategy in a subsequent column, ""Macquarie cedes its crown,"" in which Aston argued that the institution had lost its 25-year global dominance in the infrastructure asset class that it had pioneered. Together, the columns paint a picture of an institution whose celebrated success may be breeding a culture of arrogance and a ""tin ear"" to the legitimate concerns of its owners.
Aston's reporting consistently targets the dynamic between the CEO and the board chair, suggesting that corporate failure is rarely the result of a single rogue executive but rather a breakdown in the fundamental governance relationship at the apex of the organization. At NAB, Irvine's alleged ""demeanour"" is a problem for Chairman Chronican to manage. At Westpac, CEO Miller's ""unforced error"" in appointing McCann reflects on his own judgment. And at Macquarie, Chairman Stevens' failure to engage shareholders forces CEO Wikramanayake to step into the breach. This pattern reveals that Aston is not merely attacking individuals but a systemic failure of the checks and balances that are supposed to govern Australia's largest companies. Furthermore, his new subscription-based model at Rampart, which targets an affluent and influential audience willing to pay a $680 annual fee for his insights, has likely intensified his focus. The major banks are of paramount interest to this demographic, making his continued scrutiny not just a journalistic pursuit but also a strategic business imperative.
Thematic Analysis: The Pillars of Aston's Banking Critique
Synthesizing Joe Aston's bank-specific columns reveals a coherent and consistent worldview built on four interconnected pillars. His work, taken as a whole, constitutes a damning critique of what he perceives as a dysfunctional and self-serving culture pervading the highest echelons of Australian banking. These themes‚Äîof executive hubris, board impotence, misaligned incentives, and a weak regulatory environment‚Äîdo not exist in isolation but form a self-reinforcing cycle that, in Aston's view, leads to poor outcomes for customers and shareholders.
The Cult of the CEO: Hubris and Incompetence
A central theme in Aston's writing is the critique of the modern chief executive as a figure often insulated from reality, driven by ego, and sometimes lacking the specific competencies required for their role. He portrays a corporate culture where charisma and networking can trump operational expertise. The depiction of NAB's Andrew Irvine and his alleged ""dissolute style"" is a prime example, as is the characterization of Westpac's CEO Anthony Miller as a ""hitman from Goldman Sachs"" who demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of his retail banking division by appointing a PR chief to run it.
This perspective is not merely inferred from his columns. In a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session, Aston provided a direct window into his mindset, describing the corporate executives he frequently covers as ""sociopathic, avaricious, driven primarily by ego, and often incompetent"". This cynical starting point‚Äîassuming untrustworthiness until proven otherwise‚Äîinforms his forensic examination of their decisions, searching for the ego-driven misjudgments that he believes are the root cause of many corporate failings.
The Impotent Board: A Failure of Oversight
If the CEO is the protagonist in Aston's corporate dramas, the board of directors is the critical but often failed supporting actor. His columns consistently return to the theme of board impotence, whether through a lack of relevant expertise or a simple failure of courage to challenge a dominant chief executive. The ANZ board, with its ""virtually no banking expertise,"" is presented as incapable of providing meaningful oversight on the multi-billion-dollar ANZ Plus project. At Macquarie, the board's inability to manage its remuneration policies effectively led to a public rebuke from shareholders.
This critique aligns with his broader commentary on corporate scandals outside the banking sector. In analyzing the downfall of Qantas, he argued that a key failure was the board's ""weak acceptance of [the CEO's] magical explanations, and their unwillingness to create a genuine conflict situation at the boardroom table when one was needed"". This thesis is applied directly to the banking sector, where he sees boards not as robust stewards of shareholder capital but as passive enablers of imperial CEOs.
Rewards for Failure: The Remuneration-Performance Disconnect
The third pillar of Aston's critique is the frequent and, in his view, obscene disconnect between executive remuneration and genuine corporate performance. The Macquarie AGM provides the most vivid recent example, where the board was forced to defend enormous pay packets in the face of shareholder revolt. This issue is a recurring focus because, as Aston articulated in his AMA, he believes that ""all business leaders behave according to their incentives, which is to make huge profits and as a result get paid huge bonuses"".
His journalism, therefore, functions as a relentless audit of these incentive structures. He scrutinizes remuneration reports not just for their quantum but for their design, seeking to expose metrics that reward short-term financial engineering over long-term value creation and customer satisfaction. By publicly shaming boards over remuneration, he attempts to impose a reputational cost for what he sees as rewarding failure, thereby creating a disincentive for boards to approve pay packages that are not aligned with the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.
A ""Paradise for White-Collar Crime"": The Regulatory Backdrop
Underpinning all of Aston's critiques is a profound skepticism about the effectiveness of Australia's formal corporate regulatory framework. His columns are written in the long shadow of the Hayne Royal Commission, an inquiry that exposed deep, systemic misconduct across the financial services industry. While the commission led to massive remediation programs‚Äîwith NAB and Westpac provisioning over $2 billion and $1 billion respectively‚ÄîAston's continued reporting suggests that the underlying cultural drivers of this misconduct remain largely intact.
He has explicitly endorsed the view of former ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft that Australia is a ""paradise for white-collar crime"". This conviction positions his journalism as a necessary, and perhaps more effective, form of regulation. The four themes are not discrete but are parts of a vicious cycle. An impotent board appoints an unqualified CEO, fostering a cult of personality. This CEO, driven by a bonus structure that rewards failure, pursues flawed strategies that the board is unable or unwilling to challenge. This all occurs within a weak regulatory environment that fails to impose meaningful consequences. Aston's column, therefore, acts as an external force attempting to break this cycle by imposing the one penalty that corporate leaders cannot ignore: public humiliation and the subsequent threat to their tenure and reputation. In an environment where he perceives formal regulation as underfunded and toothless, his column becomes the de facto forum for accountability, wielding the power of reputational damage as a tool to enforce market discipline.
Conclusion: The ""Rear Window"" Effect and the Future of Bank Accountability
Joe Aston's sustained and incisive commentary on the Australian banking sector has established him as one of the country's most influential voices on corporate governance. By transforming the ""Rear Window"" column from a ""gossip page"" into a platform for accountability, he has created a unique form of market pressure that complements, and at times supplants, the roles of regulators and institutional investors. The ""Rear Window"" effect is a tangible force in Australian corporate life, shaping narratives, influencing decisions, and holding the powerful to account.
Measuring the Impact
The direct impact of Aston's work is evident in specific instances, such as a shareholder using his column to publicly challenge the ANZ board at its AGM, or his reporting on NAB creating a climate of intense scrutiny that has visibly destabilized its leadership. While no bank CEO resignations can be as directly attributed to his reporting as was the case with Qantas, his work creates significant ""headline risk"" for all major financial institutions. The fear of being featured in his column‚Äîa fear confirmed by his former editor's anecdote that the most common question from business leaders was how to manage him‚Äîundoubtedly influences executive behavior and corporate communications. He has become a permanent, unpredictable variable in the risk calculus of every major bank board in the country.
Comparative Analysis: Aston in the Media Landscape
Aston's contribution is best understood when contrasted with that of other prominent Australian financial journalists, most notably Adele Ferguson. Ferguson's groundbreaking investigative work, particularly her ""Banking Bad"" series, was instrumental in exposing the systemic, customer-facing misconduct that ultimately led to the Hayne Royal Commission. Her journalism gave voice to the victims of the banks' ""hard-sell culture"" and uncovered widespread fraud and mismanagement from the bottom up.
Aston's approach is complementary but distinct. Where Ferguson focuses on the systemic impact on customers, Aston conducts a forensic critique of the decision-makers at the top. His targets are not faulty processes in the abstract, but the specific CEOs, chairs, and board members he deems incompetent, arrogant, or ethically compromised. If Ferguson exposes the rot throughout the foundations of the building, Aston attacks the cracks in the penthouse suite. Together, their work provides a comprehensive, top-to-bottom indictment of the failures in Australian banking culture and governance.
Strategic Insights for Stakeholders
The body of Aston's work offers critical strategic lessons for various stakeholders in the financial ecosystem:
 * For Investors & Proxy Advisors: Aston's columns function as a high-value, qualitative risk overlay. They highlight governance ""red flags,"" cultural pathologies, and leadership deficiencies that are often invisible in quantitative financial analysis. His reporting provides an essential tool for assessing the non-financial risks that can lead to significant value destruction.
 * For Bank Boards & Executives: The enduring lesson from the Aston era is that in a transparent and hyper-connected media environment, competence and perception are inextricably linked. A poor executive appointment or a mismanaged project is no longer an internal matter to be managed; it is a public crisis-in-waiting. Proactive governance, genuine transparency, and an ability to address criticism substantively are now essential components of corporate leadership.
 * For the Future of Financial Journalism: Aston's successful launch of the premium subscription service Rampart may represent a viable new model for high-impact, personality-driven accountability journalism. By creating a direct commercial relationship with an audience that values his fearless and incisive commentary, he has demonstrated a path to sustainability outside the structures of traditional media, potentially inspiring a new generation of independent watchdogs.
Ultimately, Joe Aston's departure from the Australian Financial Review and the birth of Rampart has not diminished his influence; it has concentrated it. His continued, relentless focus on the banking sector ensures that the ""Rear Window"" effect will persist as a powerful force for accountability. Australia's bank boards and executive teams will continue to operate with the knowledge that their decisions, their judgments, and their character will be subject to the uniquely sharp and impactful scrutiny of the nation's most feared columnist.",1,1756501290.0,circlejerkauscorp,0,1.0,False

Exiting the LIRV, Benjamin Ford stretched as he turned to the massive four-story structure where the Minutemen and other Special Forces were residing. The building base was smooth gray stone, with burnt umber wood panels covering the rest. Mini decks spread around the sides, where the officers had claimed.

From what Ford understood, this higher-class apartment building was used by the city's elite, support staff for the Palace next door, and diplomats. Anyone with money, influence, and power stayed there.

Ryder turned toward his teammates and said, ""Barrett, I wanted everyone rested.""

After getting the acknowledgment from the Sergent First Class, the Comanche Captain and Warrant Officer-1 departed the group, heading to the Minutemen-occupied City Palace.

""Where are they going?"" Fraeya asked.

""Debriefing,"" Ford replied. ""They do that after every mission.""

""Do not forget that the Bossman is a King now,"" Higgins jokingly said.

""Debriefing?"" Fraeya said. ""Oh, you mean like what they did to me? I am surprised you will succumb to that torture of your own people.""

There were some chuckles from some members of Comanche from Fraeya's comments. However, Ford knew it wasn't from a silly perspective. The idea is that officers go into a complex meeting after every mission to overview every detail, especially in a world they know little about. The humorous truth was that the elf girl might have had a better experience.

Hearing the next group of LIRVs stopping, Ford watched as Horatius exited their vehicles except for the luperca, who was riding in the cargo bay because of his size. Some Legionaries struggled to get out as they were not used to Altaerrie vehicles, making Ford wonder if it was their first time in a car.

From his limited experience with Alagore culture, Ford learned that while the people have advanced vehicles such as walkers and wagonettes, these vehicles for civilian purposes didn't seem familiar. As Fraeya explained, crafting complex magitech was costly, making him wonder if the average person couldn't afford such luxury.

""Hey, Sergeant First Class,"" Natilite said. ""Is it okay if Fraeya and I head out? They reopened the bathhouse.""

Some of the team's male members cracked jokes about the subject, confusing the Templar and the Elf Girl. While this was strange to the Americans, based on the girl's reaction, this custom was normalized in this world, so it never crossed their minds that it could be considered a joke. The nerdy Sergeant recalled reading stories from history videos and fantasy manga about how this was common in federal and classical cultures.

""Why?"" Fraeya asked. ""It is normal for you to shower together; why is bathing funny?""

""Well,"" Barrios said. ""When you put it like that.""

Gregory Barrett got between the team members, calming everyone. ""Enough. Comanche, hit the showers. Fraeya, Nat, go have fun. Just don't leave the city.""

As the women departed, the team went inside and went to the converted armories. Comanche were getting out of their battlesuits to be recharged and repaired by the technicians. Some members of the team were boasting about beating back the Aristocracy. The Twins were commenting on what they would do tonight with their dates and fantasizing about the bathhouses.

""What do you think of our new allies?"" Gonzales asked.

When Ford disconnected his exoskeleton and placed the damaged sections in a bin. ""They seem to be able to handle themselves,"" he said.

""And thank God for that,"" Wallace said. ""I don't mind holding the Militia hands, but Hispana is supposed to be the big boys in this world. If we had to hold their hands, we're screwed.""

""I get that,"" Barrios said. ""I guarantee they are having the same conversation about us.""

""Then we have nothing to fear,"" Forest interjected. ""If the rumors and their namesake are true, they are the descendants of the Roman Empire. I would hope they live up to that reputation.""

""I know there are a lot of similarities,"" Ford said. ""Do you believe that?""

""They call themselves Legionaries, Hispana,"" Forest replied.

""And let us not forget, they worship the Republic,"" Barrett said. ""Their armor and ranks resemble the Empire. The terms they use.""

""And explains the evolved version of Latin,"" Higgins said.

""The question is how?"" Wallace asked.

""Through the Bridge, of course,"" Ford said.

""I get that,"" Wallace replied. ""But, how? You think that would have been recorded or clues were left.""

The armory door opened, and the Minutemen Combat Team-Viking entered. Their uniforms were messy and had an intense odor from being in combat for days.

""Viking,"" Forest said. ""Welcome back to the Den.""

""Did you guys break through?"" Ford asked.

""We did,"" Graham replied. ""We were able to take out the amplifier tower that was destroying our drones.""

Surprised by the stern response, Ford turned to his Staff Sergeant, who reacted similarly. They had a successful mission; however, something was off. That was when he noticed Sergeant Patterson was missing.

""Hey,"" Ford asked. ""Where is Patterson?""

Viking's Sergeant Graham responded as he started dismounting from his battlesuit. ""KIA. He was discovered by an Orc and killed.""

""Weren't you equipped with a cloaking module?"" Higgins asked.

""Yes,"" Bailey said. ""But they had one of those beast humanoids with them. Neko.""

Graham closed the weapons locker and said, ""Our cloak gimmick allowed us to slip easily, but the wind was against us. That damn feline smelt us. Then they got the jump on us while we were pulling back.""

Ford turned toward Barrett and saw the sign not to respond, something he struggled to do anyway. It was never easy to lose a brother-in-arm. With all the modern technology and state-of-the-art training the United States had, something could always go wrong.

""Are you going to do a twenty-one-cheer salute?"" Barrios asked.

""They don't sell his favorite beer here,"" Bailey said. ""But we will.""

Watching Viking head toward the showers, Ford stood there thinking of their lost comrade. He didn't know him well, being new to the Minutemen. Still, the Sergeant understood that losing a brother was never easy. A twenty-one-cheer salute was a team's tradition of honoring their lost brethren with their favorite alcohol and telling stories.

Barrios exited the showers and started getting dressed. ""Hey, Ben. Do you want to come to the bar with us? Going to get slammed tonight.""

""Thank you for the offer,"" Ford replied. ""I will pass. I think I am going to go around town for a bit. Get some fresh air.""

""If you get bored,"" Wallace said as he entered. ""You know where we will be.""

Listening to the gentle, artificially built stone waterfall steaming hot water into the large bath, Natilite leaned back as she embraced the full sensation of the spa. With the scented candles, her once-tense muscles started easing up, and she felt the liquid brushing against her feathers. The Valkyrie was able to lower her guard and enjoy the moment.

""I needed this.""

""I hate to admit it,"" Fraeya said. ""I forgot how it felt to be a woman. This feels so nice.""

""There is nothing like laying back, letting your body feel gentle again.""

""I have to admit,"" Fraeya said. ""I enjoy the Altaerrie hot showers, but they miss the relaxation. I feel like I have to rush, not enjoying the moment.""

Hot baths are a known luxury. Laying naked within hot springs, or in this case, artificial hot springs powered by an Altaerrie generator, is a luxury. Using the natural water that flowed under the city mixed with smoothing milk, a costly addition, the Templar believed they deserved it. Lovely leaf petals added a natural touch.

Based on her comrades' reactions, it became clear the Americans didn't have a similar culture regarding luxury. This made her conclude that when this spa requested a generator, the Americans didn't fully understand what it was for, which she found funny. However, this difference confused her as bathing was regular within Lat territory. Strangely, they were acting closer to Vampires.

The Valkyrie glanced over at the wood elf, who was also enjoying the bath. She could tell the stress of the past few months had faded away.

""Fraeya.""

""Yes?""

""I want to say I am proud of you. You have come a long way since I met you. All in a short period of time.""

""Thank you. It has been hard adapting to soldier life. This was the life I never expected to venture into. I can understand the change. It was not easy for a woman to transition into a fighter. If you need anything, please tell me.""

Fraeya began combing her hair, focusing on a knot. ""I just hope I am making my Father proud.""

""I believe he would be,"" Natilite said. ""We will find him.""

""You do not think he is dead?""

""I do not know, but he is important. Being one of the few experts in orilla, they need him.""

The elf girl held her legs together, comforting herself. ""I hope.""

Natilite saw the drama in her new friend's eyes. She missed her family. Understanding that it was never easy to lose family, especially recently, she decided to change the subject. ""How is your research?"" she asked.

Fraeya lowered herself into the soapy water, sighing at the question. ""It reminds me of the academy. The never stopping questions.""

""Is that bad? I am surprised it has been this complicated.""

""Not really. The issue is that Altaerrie has no terms or words related to magic and magitech. I have to speak as if I am talking to a child.""

""The Altaerrie as children?""

The elf girl carefully looked at the Valkyrie. Her sharp eyes suddenly got wider and frankly shook sideways. ""I did not mean to insult.""

Natilite gently placed her hands over her lips, giggling. ""I know. I found it funny.""

""It has been hard. I am a student, not a teacher, so I am not used to this.""

""I believe in you. Have you attempted to find help? I will speak with Temprass Finnea. If it is related to the Bridge, I think they will spare one of their mages to assist.""

""Thank you, Templar.""

""Fraeya..., you do not have to be as formal with me. We are friends now.""

The elf girl's eyes widened with brightness. She hurriedly approached the Valkyrie and grabbed the flying human's hand. ""Do you mean it? We are friends?""

Finding the response confusing, Natilite responded, ""Yeah, I think so. We have been through a lot. I would like to be friends.""

""Like you and the Captain?""

This question caught the Templar off guard more than she expected. She couldn't help but turn bright red. A slight tension in her chest grew. ""Wha..., what do you mean by that?""

Fraeya blinked her eyes and swam backward. ""I meant, they have been commenting on how close you two have been. You two have become close friends, and I find that impressive.""¬†

""What would that be impressive?""

""I do not know. I have heard stories about Templar's struggle to befriend, and with how different the Altaerrie are, I was worried they would not like you.""

The wood elf then poked her index fingers, staring at them. ""I did not have many friends growing up. Either moving around with Father. Relocating because elves hated that I am a half breed, or living with Lats. With my father being considered a disgrace, it was hard. But I have made so many since being here.""

As Natilite listened, she couldn't help but find the elf girl adorable but good-hearted. In some manner, this had been a second chance for her new elf friend. New people mean no cultural baggage to weigh each other down. This was also an experience that she had.

The Comanche mage was correct regarding the life of a Templar. It is glorious, having fame and fortune. However, there is a disconnect. It was hard to make friends with those who were not genetically modified. A Templar knows many but is close to few.

With Comanche and their people, it has been a change of pace, something Natilite wasn't expecting. They have no such warriors on Earth, meaning no culture developed for such super warriors.

However, her mind raced toward Mathew Ryder, thinking about their many conversations‚Äîthe fight at the abandoned fort and more. ""I can understand how you feel. I have grown to respect Matt since we met. Being taken by Kallem and then surviving the wild while protecting a child. Most men on Alagore would never survive that challenge. That is why we are close friends.""

""I remember him being taken,"" Fraeya said. ""I was surprised at how loyal his team was. I hope we all can remain friends forever.""

""Speaking of friends,"" Natilite said. ""I see you have healed relations with Ben.""

Fraeya glanced at the water in shame. ""I think so. I feel like an excetra, blaming him for saving my life.""

""Do not be so harsh,"" Natilite replied. ""You were in an emotional state. Be happy that you came to terms.""

As the conversation continued, Natilite saw Fraeya enter a depressed mood. To cheer herself up, the elf formed a water ball in the air from the bath water.

Watching the playful waterfall gave Natilite an idea. She glanced at the smooth, soapy water. Then, an idea appeared in her head that made her jittery. ""Fraeya. Can you make bubbles?""

At first, the elf girl looked confused. She glanced down at the spa water and then smiled. The elf placed her hands under water. Her hands glowed, and bubbles mixed with soup ripped across the bath's surface, causing the two women to giggle.

\*\*\*\*\*

Walking through the Palace doors, Mathew Ryder saw dozens of Minuteman staff working hard. They were coordinating the other Combat Fire Teams in the field or preparing for future operations.

""Looks like everyone is busy,"" Ryder commented.

""It has been a busy few weeks,"" King said. ""I heard Aristocracy Franolgno Brigaton pressed against 1st Brigade in the north.""

""It is just a diversion,"" Ryder said. ""Direct resources and attention from Salva.""

""They are a present bunch,"" King said.

When the Palace security allowed the two Minutemen to acknowledge Ryder's rank, the militiaman addressed him as¬†Duke. This wasn't the first time many townsfolk had accepted him and his daughter as city political leaders. The two MPs were subtle, but he could see they negatively reacted to being called a royal title. On the other hand, his friend made a quick joke about his installed royal statues.

King glanced at the silent Captain, then placed his hands on his hips. ""I am sorry; I didn't mean to offend.""

""You weren't,"" Ryder said. ""I am just worried about how people will view me being called that.""

""All right, Matt,"" King asked. ""What is on your mind?""

Ryder suddenly regretted saying what was on his mind, seeing that he had opened Pandora's box. ""Forget it.""

King grabbed Ryder's arm, stopping them both. ""What is on your mind?""

Ryder placed his hands on his hips in frustration. ""I have been hearing comments. What does the team think of all this royal nonsense?""

""Why does their opinion matter, Matt?""

""Don't give me that; you saw those MPs, and they are not the first. No one wants to say it, but I am starting to be seen as a joke by my people.""

""And if you want to know if the team is solid?"" King asked.

""Correct,"" Ryder responded. ""I am starting to see that balancing both worlds could ruin my reputation. The whole Ceka situation alone... I sometimes wonder if my wife would be disappointed with how I turned out. Things used to be so simple.""

""Do you want my opinion, Matt?""

""Of course.""

""Shut up.""

It took a moment for Ryder to react, as that was not the response he expected. ""What?""

""I personally think what you and Hackett are doing is strange. A lordship? I will admit that the situation at the Redvale Guild left a knot in my gut.""

""So, I did make the wrong decision?""

King didn't hesitate, jabbing his finger into the Captain's chest with determination. ""I did not say that. I am not in your shoes. Those MPs are not. Comanche is not. None of us have a royal Princess as a daughter with thousands of years of alien history and culture to navigate. I can sit here as a moral judge without having to deal with any consequences, but I was not forced to make a significant policy decision out of thin air that could have lasting implications. None of us have to make a decision or live with it, so who gives a damn.""

The Warrant Officer then aggressively poked the Captain in the chest again. ""The Colonel has confidence; Nat has confidence. The people of Salva have noticed. I might not agree with everything, but I have confidence. The issue is that you need to have that confidence and hell with anyone who disagrees. That is what Carol would want.""

Matthew Ryder took a deep breath and glanced around to gather his thoughts. He then turned back to his friend with a deep, stressful breath. ""You're right,"" he said.

""If course I am right,"" King said. ""I am your XO. It is my job to slap nonsense into a superior officer.""

The two chuckled at the horrible joke. They shook hands before continuing their journey into the Palace, walking into the front office section that inhabited the facility's main chamber. This room was once the foremost gathering of the formal leader of Salva. Because of its size, it was the ideal location to place the central support staff for the Minutemen Headquarters.

Right off the bat, Ryder couldn't help but feel something was off. He couldn't determine if it was related to a well-performing mission or his insecurities. He had a moment of clashing, but an emotion he had never experienced appeared.

Captain Smith, who was standing next to the front office, giggled.

""What is so funny?"" Ryder asked.

""What you said was cute,"" Smith said. ""Your daughter isn't here, and you noticed that. You miss her.""

""I know she is not here,"" Ryder said. ""She is doing an outreach to a fishing village with the Ambassador.""

""That does not mean you don't miss her,"" Smith said. ""Honestly, many here do. I have never seen so many grown men miss a child. I guess delivering coffee daily would leave an impression. It is shocking how the little things matter.""

The Captain didn't realize how much of an impression his daughter made at the Minutemen Headquarters. Since arriving at Salva, she has dressed in her maid's clothing and passed water and snacks to the working staff. Even after ascending to the station of Princess of Salva, the dual-eyed colored girl continued this ritual when she was not in meetings with the Council.

However, what Smith said was also true. While he knew that Assiaya was off on a mission, a part of him missed her greeting when coming home. This was a feeling he had never experienced before. Even when his wife was alive, she was always home when he got home.

""Do you know when my daughter and the Ambassador left?"" Ryder asked.

""I..., do not know,"" Smith said. ""Assiaya left here this morning, and the village isn't that far, so they should be back soon. But I don't know.""

Finding the answer acceptable and not wanting to bagger Smith. Especially since she was his superior.

He started filling out paperwork before heading to Hackett for his unit debrief. Once she got home, he debated what to do tonight with Assayia. The Captain wanted to show her some American movies on his laptop.

""Speak of the devil,"" Smith said.

Finding the comment strange, Ryder turned around and saw the Ambassador, Susian West, enter the Palace. Seeing that his plans could be sped up, a surprising sense of joy consumed him.

""Welcome, Ambassador,"" Ryder said. ""I do not think we have properly introduced.""

West approached the front desk, staring at her tablet, refusing to acknowledge the Comanche Captain. ""So, you are the Junior Officer playing Lord.""

Ryder closed his eyes, frustrated by the comment. He turned to his friend, who shrugged before turning toward the female Captain, who stared at him and warned him to shrug it off.

""I am ready when you are, Duke,"" West said condescendingly.

The Captain awkwardly glanced at the woman but decided to take the Smith's advice and remained silent. Now that it was time for the after-action debrief, he started following the Minutemen officer but suddenly stopped as if a freight train had impacted him with full force.

Out of nowhere, Ryder felt like he was hit by a freight train and realized something was wrong. He turned toward the Ambassador and asked, ""Where is Assiaya?""

""What?"" West asked, partially glancing toward the Comanche Captain with annoyance.

""You heard me.""

""Watch it, soldier boy. The Army didn't want the State Department involved in this royal nonsense, so be it. Besides, if I wanted to play babysitter, I would have a little monster myself.""

""Matt."" Smith then looked around and realized why the Comanche Captain was frantic about it.

Feeling nothing but boiling anger through his veins, Ryder turned to his XO and saw the same concern. The two nodded, and then the Captain marched past the two women and headed downstairs to Colonel Hackett.

Seeing the reinforced door, Ryder was about to barge inside but was stopped by Rommel King.

""Boss,"" King said. ""Take one breath and reform.""

Ryder wanted to push his friend away but saw the wisdom in it. Taking one deep breath and readjusting his posture to look more professional, he realized he was about to disrespect his mentor by bargaining inside and making demands. ""Thank you.""

""That is my job. Now, let's do this.""

The Captain knocked on the door and heard the Ambassador descending the stairs. Wanting to get inside quickly, he entered the office when he heard the signal. He saw his mentor at his desk, going through recently translated documents.

As the Colonel prepared to acknowledge Ryder, he quickly said, ""Sir. I have a question I need to ask ASAP. Please.""

Hackett stared at him with confused eyes but noticed the seriousness in the Captain's eyes. The Colonel dropped the document and leaned into his chair. ""Shoot.""

""Where is Assiaya?""

The older gray-haired Caucasian man with fading black hair tilted his head in confusion. ""She is with the Ambassador at the village....""

Hearing the door open, Ryder turned and saw Susian West entering the room, which confused the Minuteman Colonel's eyes.

""Colonel,"" West said. ""Your Captain here was very disrespectful to me. I want to know what kind of operation you are running?""

""I will answer that after you tell me where the Princess of Salva is,"" Hackett responded.

""Not this again,"" West said. ""Why are you asking me? Ask this Duke here. He is the one playing Lord.""

Ryder quickly turned toward the Ambassador to respond. However, he heard his mentor say, ""Captain,"" warning him not to intervene. It was taking all his strength not to comment on the situation as his mind raced to where his daughter could be, but he stood at attention.

William Hackett directed his attention to the Ambassador. ""You were supposed to go to the fishing village with the Princess in a diplomatic outreach and secure a new foodline,"" he said.

""With all due respect, Colonel,"" West said. ""I am a state official. I do not do entry-level missions like going to backwater fishing villages. Isn't that why you two created this role-playing game in the first place?""

Hackett leaned back in his chair, placing his figures together while daggering eyes at the Ambassador. ""Let me get this straight. When I pick up this phone to call the Leutenant General, I am going to tell him that you left a twelve-year-old girl, our Princess and the last survivor of the formal regime of these lands that is critical to establishing our creditability and swing potential allies to our side - and let's not forget Matt's daughter, who survived six years as a slave and for a week barely surviving being hunted down. How many more¬†Ands¬†can I add to this before making that call?""

Ryder couldn't help but glance toward the Ambassador as the room went silent. The woman's eyes widened before being replaced with panic when she realized the gravity of the situation. He was utterly shocked by his mentor's attitude toward the official State Department diplomat. Typically, they are given a tremendous amount of respect as civilians overseeing the military; however, he knew the Minutemen Colonel had her.

A red light appeared on the intercom, and Hackett leaned over and pressed it. ""I will respond in a minute. Also, please contact Lieutenant General Sherman.""

""I will,""¬†Smith said.¬†""However, I just got word from the Northeast gate. Assiaya arrived with Yeldan and a member of the Elstina family. Apparently, she went to the village without the Ambassador.""

A sense of relief swept over Mathew Ryder, knowing that his daughter was safe‚Äîat least long enough for him to kill her for this stunt. He could see the same sense of relief from Hackett and West. His mentor was happy for the girl's safety; however, he could tell the diplomat was thrilled that her career possibility was about to implode.

""Thank you, Captain,"" Hackett said. ""I want you to get Assiaya here ASAP.""

The Colonel switched channels, and Sherman answered. The two senior officers spoke about the incident for about forty minutes, with some fire words in the mix. The Captain or Ambassador was not allowed to speak but only to listen, adding to the tension.

The office door opened, and Captain Smith and Princess Assiaya entered the room. The Princess ran over and hugged her father.

""I am sorry,"" Assiaya said. ""I did not mean to cause trouble.""

""It is okay,"" Ryder said. ""We will talk later.""

""I am glad you are all right, Assiaya,"" Hackett said. ""Now, what happened? And I want the truth. No sidestepping.""

The dual-eyed Princess took a deep breath as she understood the gravity of the situation. ""I went to the Ambassador officer so we could go the Nagal fishing village. I was turned away multiple times, and the final time, I was kept waiting for hours. Then I discovered she was napping the entire time.""

The mood in the room changed, and the Colonel stared directly at the Ambassador. West glanced toward Assiaya with hatred in her eyes.

""Let me guess,"" Hackett said. ""You went off alone?""

""Not alone,"" Assiaya said. ""The House of Elstina sent their oldest son as an escort, and I recruited two Militiamen. I know how dangerous it is out there, and you said you approved me going to the village.""

""I know you do,"" Hackett said. ""And under the understanding of guidance and protection by our security.""

""I thought,"" Assiaya replied. ""The Militia counted.""

Sensing the tense atmosphere she had created, the Princess quickly added, ""But.... I have good news. The village agreed to the terms. They wanted to sell fish, but they requested military protection. I told them I had to discuss this with you first.""

""At least something good came from this mess,""¬†Sherman said over the phone.¬†""Colonel, follow up with this lead. Ambassador West, after you go to the village and secure that supply line, I will meet you at¬†Indolass¬†to continue this conversation.""

When the Lieutenant General hung up, the Ambassador quickly left the room.

Hackett then rubbed the top of his nose in frustration. ""All right. We have our orders, so we will follow through on them. Next time Assiaya, come to me.""

""I am sorry,"" Assiaya said. ""I wanted to prove that I am not useless.""

""You are not useless,"" Ryder said.

""Saying that,"" Hackett said. ""While I might not be thrilled with how this unfolded, thank you for not going off alone and being somewhat responsible. Be careful doing that, though. There is a chain of command; please follow it.""

Assiaya bowed. ""I am sorry.""

""Now that it is settled, time for the both of you to relax.""

April 10th, 2068 (Military Calendar)

Hiplose Woods, the former Confederacy of Daru'uie

Nevali Region, Aldrida, Alagore

¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

¬†

Staring at the City-State of Salva, Kallem Verliance saw the heavy defenses of the Altaerrie position. Sparks and light explosions as his forces assaulted the city, attempting to breach the walls.

""The Altaerrie have been more fortifiable than expected,"" Kallem stated.

""Their layer defense has been formal,"" Korva responded. ""Look here.""

The Lord of Verliance walked to his recently promoted Field Marshal, who was staring at a crystal screen attached to a four-legged crawler. The resolution was the typical fluid, but being so close to the battle, there was some additional distortion.

The perspective came from one of the many seeker constructs flying through the area, recording every detail. A section from the 13th Order, approximately four hundred fifty men, assaulted the southeast region of the wall where the Unity attacked a few days ago.

The section was fighting valiantly against the Altaerrie, occupying a critical hill close to the city. An intense firefight was being waged as his warriors attempted to reach the base of the Salva wall while the enemy was defending.

The screen switched to a broader view of the city. As Aristocracy artillery came to strike the city in an attempt to provide cover for their attacking force, multiple turrets sprayed the sky, neutralizing most of their bombardment, with only a few able to penetrate their defenses.

""And this is why you have failed to breach the city?"" Kallem asked.

""Yes, my Lord,"" Korva said. ""Our Unity allies have identified additional missile turrets closer to Indolass. They seem to have further reach than the ones I showed you.""

""And what about our artillery?"" Kallem asked. ""I have heard we have sustained casualties?""

""Some,"" Korva responded as he displayed a regional map on the screen with marks of fire support locations. ""It is not as concerning as the troops are making it, but we have sustained some losses.""

""Are you not relocating them after a volley?"" Kallem asked.

""Of course I am, My Lord,"" Korva said. ""The issue is not our tactics.""

""Then what?""

""The Altaerrie artillery can respond faster than we are used to. After every volley, our units must relocate because the enemy will respond within minutes. Sometimes less.""

""That quickly? And accurate?""

""Correct. I spoke with Commander Stadius Fabillus about the matter. His people believe the Altaerrie have superior elecaves technology, a detection device that tracks objects with electromagnetic wavelengths. Somehow, they can track our shells when firing and discover our location through geometry.""

The Vampire Lord soaked up all this new information, attempting to devise a strategy for the Altaerrie different technological abilities. Initially, it was forgivable for those who believed the other worlders enchanted weapons were no threat against magitech. While distinct and inferior in some areas compared to their tools, the ruler of Verliance could see that this had allowed their new enemies to surpass others, not being restricted to magic.

With weeks of no-stop bombardment against the city, it had achieved little. While area defense was not unknown to the Great Powers on Alagore, utilizing amplifiers to shield critical targets, it was the mannerisms the Altaerrie deployed that were a surprise to them. While they have identified some energy-based lances, most of their weapons have been kinetic. However, it was not invincible. With enough volleys and energy, base bolts can penetrate the enemy defenses. The effectiveness of these weapons has been an unknown challenge, preventing any breakthrough.

Korva then chuckled, catching the Vampire Lord off guard. ""It feels like the early days against the Unity? Does it not?""

Kallem stared at his long friend and gave a soft laugh. He found it humorous that his people were back at square one when encountering a far technologically superior enemy. ""It sure does, my friend.""

""All this effort for such an ugly place,"" Ere-hian said. ""When will we take the Palace?""

Kallem slowly turned toward his son. He saw the boy standing on the hillside next to many entrenched soldiers, watching the battle continue. His posture showed his excitement, this being the first battle the young Lord had witnessed. ""When the opportunity arrives,"" he replied.

""I cannot wait to see the fear of that traitorous slave,"" Ere-hian stated. ""Opposing her superiors in such a matter. She will regret fleeing and humiliating our House name.""

""Calm, my son.""

Ere-hian turned to his father, surprised by the comment. ""Calm? That Lat slave that you favored murdered a Priestess of the Katra! And dishonored our family name.""

""Because of your actions."" Kallem glanced toward his son, seeing a frustrated stare but unable to challenge the truth.

Word of his formal slave identity had spread throughout the Aristocracy. The last of Balan's blood, the formal rules of the Confederacy of Daru'uie, had returned and taken root in Salva. He was prepared to be inquired into by his Unity master and his vessels. Still, the results were more positive than expected.

He was not so blind that many people had questioned his decision to have a small Lat slave girl by his side. Still, with her identity revealed, it clarified many of those lingering thoughts. Having the daughter of a multi-century rivalry appeared to be enough reasoning for most‚Äîa¬†symbolic trophy.

This only made his false story believable: a Lat, or now the Altaerrie, taking a highly valuable prize, a noble girl was at least enough for most to avoid asking additional questions. Sadly, the event cost him considerably in terms of influence, command, and autonomy from Unity.

""If I knew-.""

""What led you to believe you were entitled to such knowledge?""

""I...."" Ere-hian glanced away as he regretfully reflected on his father's words.

""Lord Verliance. Let the youth express themselves. For a long-living race, they are young for a short time.""

Kallem knew who was approaching: Temprass Savulot from the Temple of Enlightenment. A thick robe covered the woman's natural feather beauty. There was a kitsune holding an umbrella with two servants following.

""Savulot,"" Kallem said. ""It is dangerous to be here. You should go back to camp.""

""I promise not to be long,"" Savulot said. ""I came with enlightening news.""

""Enlightening?"" Kallem asked. ""Yesterday, you expressed disappointment that the site has not been uplifted.""

""I stand by my concerns,"" Savulot said. She took a cloth and wiped her hands. ""I spoke with Commander Fabillus, and while I disagree with the level of progress, he has accepted your viewpoint on the siege.""

""Is that your enlightening news?""

""Of course not. I have learned of a town nearby with one of my priestesses on a conversation mission. The Altaerrie occupied them during their attack before the siege. The town remained loyal and rebelled against their occupiers when Unity warriors came to dislodge our enemies.""

""I will grant that is positive news,"" Kallem said. ""I would not group it as a critical victory. A slight boost in morale at most.""

""I agree with your viewpoint,"" Savulot said. ""That is not why I came to inform you. I wish to bring your son with me. It will be important to show the youthful leader how the light rewards those who walk the path of enlightenment and how we strike down those who resist.""

""You are requesting that I watch a reformation?"" Ere-hian excitedly said.

""Yes,"" Savulot said. ""My young Lord.""

""My son should remain by my side,"" Kallem quickly said. ""Learning the inner works of a military campaign is more important than seeing a frontier town.""

""Father!"" Ere-hian said.

""It is okay, young Prince,"" Savulot said. ""Lord Verliance, I must protest. Living by example has been a founding old principle. For example, it creates order, purpose, and stability. If you wish to maintain control over these lands, your subjects must know loyalty will be rewarded.""

""Father,"" Ere-hian said. ""I would wish to see this town. I promise to be an observer and not intervene. I want to see this practice.""

""My Lord,"" Savulot gently said. ""If the young Prince is ruler one day, he should witness all elements of leadership. This is the time. Unless you are not faithful to our alliance?""

A powerful knot develops within the Vampire Lord's gut. He is not thrilled about allowing his son to leave with a Unity Temprass without supervision; however, he sees no choice. He nods in agreement and sees his eager son following the religious leader.

A part of him was happy to see his son happy again, wanting to learn more about the world. Not being stuck at home, brewing over his dead mother every day. It was his mistake to shelter his children at home this long. He only hoped that his son would find his path to manhood and not be corrupted in this ever-changing world. Or at least develop the skills to surpass him.

With his son gone, Kallem turned to his Field Marshal. ""Now, breaking the siege. What are the problems and solutions?""",3,1756501127.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Time Magazine has crowned the pontiff as one of the 2025 ""Top 100 Most Influential People in Artificial Intelligence."" Why, you ask? It turns out, the Vatican isn't just about ancient rituals and big hats; it's diving headfirst into the swirling ethics of AI with a mission to keep humanity... well, human.

Pope Leo XIV‚Äîchanneling the esteemed Leo XIII who tackled the social upheaval of the Industrial Revolution‚Äîis ringing the bell on AI's moral dilemmas while the rest of us are still asking Alexa for tomorrow's weather. He‚Äôs the thinker we never knew we needed, pondering if AI will lead us to enlightenment or just another existential crisis. And it seems the Vatican is taking all this quite seriously, even hosting conferences to hash out whether AI will become humankind's best ally in healthcare or its scariest adversary.

The Pope‚Äôs not alone in this high-stakes game of technological chess. Fellow ""power movers"" named alongside him include the usual suspects‚ÄîElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and a few surprise political figures. But what sets Leo XIV apart? He's reminding us that in a world racing to outsmart the toaster, we still need to look in the mirror every once in a while and consider our reflection.

Welcome to the age of AI dermatologists, where algorithms might soon be outshining the family doctor in spotting skin irritations. Let‚Äôs dive into this brave new world brought to us by the YOLO v5 AI model, which is not to be confused with ‚ÄúYou Only Live Once,‚Äù but it might help ensure you live itch-free.

**What‚Äôs All the Buzz About?**

The AI model in question claims a stellar track record: classifying skin irritation with an accuracy of 98.3% and flawlessly flexing its precision muscles with an F1 score of 0.982. These numbers aren't just for show; they're reshaping dermatology, promising quicker, more consistent diagnoses without the grumpy waiting room magazines.

**Why YOLO v5 Matters**

YOLO v5 isn't some James Bond gadget. It stands for ""You Only Look Once,"" but don't be fooled‚Äîthis AI never takes its eyes off the ball (or skin patch). It‚Äôs a sleek object detection algorithm trouncing the shortcomings of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in skin diagnostics. In a study involving over 80,000 images, this model proves that AI might just have better hindsight than foresight.

**How It Works**

Patients volunteer, and AI studies images of patch tests, meticulously grading them on a 5-point scale, from ‚Äúno reaction‚Äù to ‚Äúwow, that's red.‚Äù Each photo snapped, processed, and critiqued by well-trained evaluators (and their AI sidekick), leaving nothing to chance. Remember, it‚Äôs not just about finding redness‚Äîit‚Äôs about catching the difference between ‚ÄúI showered too hot‚Äù and ‚ÄúI need to see a dermatologist.‚Äù

**Beyond Patch Testing**

AI in dermal diagnostics could soon standardize treatments, ushering in a new era where your virtual skin consultant knows if you‚Äôre prone to flare-ups before you even itch. Future enhancements might expand its reach, allowing it to diagnose from home, whispering tips on skin care through your smartphone while you sip your morning coffee.

As the title states, I am ready to give up on applying for graduate schools in clinical psychology. This year will officially be my fourth year applying, and while I didn‚Äôt think I was a very competitive applicant in previous years, I‚Äôm still feeling defeated because of how many ‚Äúno‚Äùs I‚Äôve gotten‚Äînot only from applications, but also from trying to volunteer in labs/research, coffee meets etc.

I know that clinical programs are extremely competitive, and I really want to make this year‚Äôs application worth it. I‚Äôm honestly ready to give up mostly because I understand that my stats aren‚Äôt impressive enough to be a competitive applicant:

* GPA: 3.7/4.0 (already a bad start here LOL)
* Not Canadian (meaning I can‚Äôt apply for CIHR or SSHRC). I‚Äôve looked everywhere for funding that I might be eligible for, but I can‚Äôt seem to find anything given my low GPA and non-resident status.
* One publication, second author (I fear my professor doesn‚Äôt like me very much because I‚Äôve read his LOR and it was really weak‚Äîmaybe because he‚Äôs based in the UK where schools are less competitive for clinical programs? ).
* Three years of full-time work in two different neuroscience research labs (I know how important it is to work in a psych lab, so for the past three years I‚Äôve been actively applying for psych roles, both paid and unpaid, but no labs will take me T.T. I feel so defeated by this. Since I didn‚Äôt graduate in Canada, I just feel so alone in this process of constantly hearing ‚Äúno‚Äù from labs I‚Äôm interested in.)

I do have other stats that might be relevant‚Äîe.g. volunteer experience and re-taking higher-level psych classes‚Äîbut overall, I really don‚Äôt know how to improve my application. I feel stuck and hopeless.

Most of my friends in the field recognize how hard it is to get into clinical psych, and many are either going into medicine or shifting to other fields of psychology (e.g. counselling).

I have been digging through reddit posts for an hour trying to simply come up with a decent grinder in my price range.  I exclusively drink pour over using a Chemex with a conical burr grinder.  My old grinder finally bit the dust and I bought an Encore but there are a couple things that bother me.

1. This is probably dumb to some of you but it's important to me.  I want to press the button to grind and be able to walk away and continue with my morning ritual of getting the cat and the dogs fed and watered and let them out and the other 15 things I'm doing when I first wake up.  I don't want to stand there and hold a button for a full minute to grind my coffee beans.  I DEFINITELY don't want to hand grind.  So when I spent $200 on the Encore, I was surprised to find that I had to hold down the grind button the entire time.
2. The hopper seems to move quite a bit and even after the grind is done, the grinding mechanism (burrs?) still sound like they're grinding something.  I've checked multiple times to ensure they are seated properly but my old grinder would just spin smoothly without this rattling.

For those 2 reasons, I returned my grinder and I'm shopping for another one.  I thought it would be simple.  I was wrong.  lol

I'm finding that the most suggested grinder is the 078 and I thought ""Great!  I'll just pop on and buy one of them!""  NOPE ... $800 is too much for me to spend on a grinder at the moment.  I enjoy great coffee but I'm not sure I can justify that much money on just a grinder.  I don't think I know enough about all of this to warrant making such a purchase.  My biggest fear is that I would spend that money and not taste any difference.  I do love fresh ground coffee using the pour over method and definitely taste a huge difference between that and pre-ground coffee in a basic coffee maker.  I just don't know if I'll notice the difference between a $300 grinder and an $800 grinder.

So, I almost pulled the trigger on the Fellow Opus but as I read more, this thing is getting murdered in the reddit subs for massive retention problems.

If I'm looking for an electric conical burr grinder for pour over coffee that isn't going to cost me much over $300, do I have a solid option?

I‚Äôm worried about malware.,"I was looking into mini, portable laptops and the GPD Pocket 4 seems like a great candidate at a reasonable price. I like the modularity and the power in a small package. I had never heard anything about GPD before. I work in cybersecurity and my hardware does some pretty heavy lifting at times with password cracking, querying large amounts of data and virtualization but honestly I don‚Äôt geek out on computers like some people do. I have just one laptop and it‚Äôs like 4 years old and an upgrade I can take to the coffee shop would be fabulous.

Anyway, when I was researching, the GPD Pocket 4 looks great on its surface and I even ordered one but then I started reading about security issues  and I canceled my order. They put it on hold and offered me a discount to order it so now I‚Äôm taking the time to consider my options.

It sounds like the security issues are primarily with the software, like malware got loaded on Windows? Something with a Synaptics lookalike worm? Some comments in Reddit say malware was included out of the box with MULTIPLE models? I‚Äôm struggling a bit finding information on all this. It sounds like an employee accidentally loaded malware on the thing before it shipped out.

I can obviously load a clean copy of Windows on this but I guess I‚Äôm a little worried about the reputation of a company that has let its development chain get compromised this way. No, I‚Äôm not a person of interest but I am gonna put personal data on the thing. Is there a significant risk of firmware / rootkit or GPD-provided drivers being compromised (such that even if I load clean Windows on it, it still has malware on it)? Can anybody link me to security research about these devices or any work you‚Äôve done to check their safety, or additional information the company has provided that they now have a secure devops process for their builds?

1n3iqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1n3iqxu/explore_best_popcorn_popper_presto_and_is_it/,Explore Best Popcorn Popper Presto and Is It Worth the Hype,"Popping popcorn as quickly as possible has become something of a ritual in my household, and the Presto Poplite hot air popper didn‚Äôt disappoint. After just a couple of test runs, I found myself reaching for it whenever snack cravings struck. At first glance, the aqua and white design of the Presto Poplite gives it a soft, inviting look‚Äînot overly modern or bulky, but certainly functional in appearance. Its promise of using hot air instead of oil for a healthy, low-fat treat initially sold me, but as someone who generally loves their popcorn a little buttery and indulgent, I was curious to see how it would handle that. Spoiler: it did a pretty solid job.

**Ease of Operation and Everyday Convenience**  
Operating this popcorn popper feels about as straightforward as making coffee with a basic machine‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need a manual to figure this one out. The included measuring cup doubles as a butter melter, which is honestly kind of genius. During my first few uses, I measured out the kernels with the little scoop, dumped them into the machine, and hit go. Less than 2.5 minutes later, I had myself 18 cups of freshly popped, fluffy popcorn. Cleanup was as painless as claimed: a quick wipe was all it took since oil isn‚Äôt involved.

[Check Presto Popcorn Popper price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b0csqnbj9h/)  

**Performance and Popping Quality**  
This popcorn maker truly delivers on its promise to leave almost no unpopped kernels‚ÄîI counted maybe a handful left behind in the machine after running a full batch. The speed is impressive, especially compared to microwave popcorn bags, while the absence of any added grease makes it feel oddly clean to handle. I did notice, though, that some kernels would occasionally shoot out to nowhere mid-pop, making me rethink the placement of my popcorn bowl. But in terms of pure output, the Presto Poplite is efficient. If you‚Äôre hosting movie nights or entertaining hungry kids, this might just be your MVP appliance.

**Key Benefits**  
- Quick preparation‚Äîfresh popcorn in less than 2.5 minutes.  
- Minimal unpopped kernels in every batch.  
- Super easy to clean‚Äîno oily mess.  
- Compact size with a built-in cord wrap for simple storage.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Some kernels escape during popping, leading to a bit of cleanup if you don‚Äôt position your bowl the right way.  
- Butter-melting can feel a touch slow compared to how fast the popcorn finishes cooking.  

**Materials and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed was the lightweight feel of this machine, owing likely to its plastic construction. While the plastic doesn‚Äôt scream premium quality, it doesn‚Äôt feel overly flimsy either, making it suitable for kitchen appliances destined for moderate use. The chute that directs popcorn into the bowl is cleverly shaped, though it might not fully prevent loose kernel rebellions.

**Competing Products**  
Against stovetop popcorn makers or microwaveable bags, the Presto Poplite has a clear edge in convenience and health considerations. There‚Äôs no standing over a hot pot, furiously shaking it to prevent burning, nor do you have to deal with the overly salted or artificially flavored options common in microwave bags. However, brands like Cuisinart offer hot air poppers with slightly larger capacities. While competitors may boast all-metal builds, the simplicity and performance of the Presto Poplite make it tough to beat for quick and efficient snacking.

**Price Performance**  
In terms of cost, what you get with this popcorn popper feels fair for what‚Äôs on offer. Its capabilities align well with its price bracket, making it accessible to households without feeling overly cheap. I‚Äôve seen other popcorn machines push into triple digits for limited feature upgrades, whereas this device keeps things focused and functional. Between the healthier snacking angle and the substantial capacity, it‚Äôs an appliance worth its place in your kitchen.

My name is Trent, 35 years young, I'm not incredibly well brought up or educated but I am potentially going crazy or cursed. I have been dealing with a lot and just needed to write it down. Maybe someone with some knowledge can tell me if what I am seeing is normal. I lost something recently and I think it is making me sick in the head. Before that I guess I need to establish a few things about myself.



For starters, had I been more ambitious when I was younger, more serious, less of a fuck up, maybe I would have made something of myself. My life has been stagnant. But, I am moderately blessed and people have no right to complain about tranquil waters when real, lethal alternatives exist. I have a home, a dog, I work, I have a big loving family, or did.



I work remotely for a Software company. Just another cog in the machine of big tech doing nothing particularly special, to the point I fear AI will actually take my job soon. I quietly cope with my anxieties a mere 30 minute drive outside the Las Vegas Strip in the dry heat. I am lucky enough to work from home. A string of irrelevant conveniences and poor decisions had landed me here isolated from family and friends settling on the cheapest thing I could find that didn't look a month away from being condemned. Since moving, my social life is mostly nonexistent. The loneliness could be a bit much at first but like the anxiety, I coped. I'm the oldest of 3 with two younger sisters. We once had two loving parents. Not anymore.



My Father died when I was 12. He was a kind, loving man. According to reports one night on the way home a drunk semi driver (there are no records confirming he was ever subjected to a sobriety test, his inebriation is assumed) drifted into his lane and collided head on with him killing him instantly. The semi driver lived and never went to prison. My father, may he rest in peace, was a journalist, who logically based on some of the pieces I read during his illustrious career, had no lack of people who wouldn't have loved to silence him. I have always been suspicious of the true nature of his fate.



He'd spend nights in his study researching, sometimes months away overseas, in exotic locales covering conspiracies, wars, and really anything that passed his fancy. He was also a published writer respected in some circles; despised in others. He asked all the right and wrong questions you might say.¬†



Shortly after his death, we left for a weekend to visit my cousins only to return to find our house had been broken into with my father's study totally ransacked. But after close inspection the police and my mother, his closest confidant, harshest critic, and editor on anything he wrote, determined nothing was actually stolen. My mother never remarried, she says their love was once in a lifetime and she didn't need anybody else.¬†



On their first date when they were both 17 the story goes my Dad made her laugh so hard that she peed herself on the leather seats of my Grandad's new Lincoln he begged to borrow to impress her. He was forced to get his first part-time job after this.



Today my sisters are married, have kids, and large social circles. I am a hermit in comparison only lacking the beard and a shack in the mountains. Despite being the oldest these days my life is definitely less put together than that of my sisters‚Äô. While they shop for kids' clothes, help with homework, and are trading in their cars for SUVs to accommodate their ever growing progeny I have been rotating between the same 4 pairs of pants for nearly a decade.¬†



So naturally my Mom worried about me. She couldn't stand the idea of her baby boy being alone all the time. One day I got a call from her telling me to let her in my apartment. I opened the door to see she had bought me a puppy. A handsome German Shepherd Collie mix, about 8 weeks old. A rescue, found with his litter on an Indian reservation who'd overcome the pernicious Parvo. She drove from her home 4 states away to give him to me. My mother, always an odd one, had named him Diogenes after the Greek Cynic that liked to make fun of Plato, and was often referred to as a dog. The most memorable story of his claims that Alexander the Great wanted to meet him and approached Diogenes as he was sunbathing. Alexander requested a grain of wisdom from the mangy philosopher who duly told him to move as he was blocking the sun. Leaving the dog to his own devices the soldiers that had accompanied Alexander began to mock Diogenes for his lack of propriety. But Alexander cut such talk short and told his men, ‚ÄúIf I weren't Alexander, I would be Diogenes‚Äù.



Diogenes has been my best friend ever since sunbathing is one of his favorite pastimes.¬†

I take Diogenes just about everywhere I can. We love walking to coffee shops, and sometimes even to the bar Jenny works at on weekends. He has impeccable manners for a dog and a little vest that conveniently gets him mistaken for a service dog. I didn't even train him much, he is just smart. Smart enough to not let on how smart he actually is, the little bastard. Most people just refer to him as Dio as most of the time I don't even bother to tell people his actual name. They will look at me confused and ask, ‚ÄúIs that the Greek god of wine‚Äù? Close but no, that is Dionysus you are thinking of. I talked to my Mom almost weekly on the phone and she always asked how Diogenes is doing. Just hearing her voice would get his tail spinning like a helicopter. He knew who brought us together and he was just as thankful as I was.



Diogenes also happens to be a total chick magnet. Unfortunately, I am terrible at talking to women. They don't seem to fancy me much. Which is fine as I mostly only have my eyes on one at the moment. Her name is Jenny. She is a big fan of his and is one of the few who call him by his full name. He likewise is rather fond of her after she routinely smuggles morsels from the kitchen at her work to bribe him into friendship.



Jenny is a short woman maybe 2 or 3 years younger than myself with long hair that curls like vines and is naturally the color of a pumpkin. She has big green eyes and assets she knows how to show off just enough to keep the regulars coming back but still maintains an air of modesty. Her lips always appear to be holding back the secrets to her sensual piety. What greater weapon to wield as a woman in Sin City?



Jenny is very sweet but sometimes I struggle to talk with her on any meaningful level. I just don't know how to and tell myself she probably has a boyfriend, just likes petting the dog, shouldn't be bothered at work, add infinity. Plus, I have been going there for so long now most employees and regulars at least know or recognize me. (Or the dog at very least. He probably has more friends there than I do now that I think about it.) Couldn't making a move just make things feel awkward for her? Showing my face again after she rejected me might be seen as creepy too right? So then I am out at a conveniently placed bar with cheap drinks. For those reasons I accepted my fate of merely admiring her from afar as I sip a beer between page turns of whatever I am reading at the time. I'm not obsessed or anything, not in love, I just wish we could get to know each other better. A part of me lame as it is to say is a hopeless romantic.¬†



My sisters are busy with their families, my best friends are states away building their own as well or just drifting apart naturally. I am starting to think the only things keeping my sanity in check were Diogenes, maybe a flirty glance or chat with Jenny, and weekly talks with my mom.



I can't stress how much I love my mom. Which is why it hurt so much when I got the call from my youngest sister of her death. It came as a real shock to all of us. Because not only was she always in high spirits but she was in good health as well. Despite being I'm her 70s and retired she lived an active lifestyle and had been a personal trainer for nearly 30 years. Active as ever now running marathons having just returned from a trip to Tennessee for one where she was first in her age group. One step closer to completing a goal she had of running a marathon in every state. This was number 42 I believe.¬†



The real cause of the shock was not how unexpected it was but the means by which she passed. Her cause of death was not able to be determined. The most unnatural of natural causes. All they can really confirm is that her heart stopped. She had been out with some friends for dinner when she started mentioning it was getting hot and was feeling a burning sensation. The sensation turned into a pain that quickly could only be expressed in screams of fear and despair.¬†



I read the accounts of the witnesses, and was the only one of my siblings who watched the security cam footage. It was utterly horrific and infuriating. She screamed and cried in horrible agony before she finally died. There was no evidence of a fire, her being burned, anything, but she said she was burning. She called out to my Dad, she called out to her children, I have no words to describe the sadness I heard in her voice and how clear it was even on such a rudimentary recording. Can you have a mental breakdown so terrible it kills? A fatal anxiety attack? Surely not. So what happened?¬†



No one in the family talked about the incident. Obviously we were all unsatisfied that doctors couldn't tell us anything, police had no evidence whatsoever, the only real thing we knew were her last moments were probably full of fear, confusion, and agony. Like with my Dad. Things don't add up. In even more ways here than when he died.



I tried convincing myself what was happening to me was a result of some depression from losing her. Something in my head. But I don't know anymore if it is related or pure coincidence. It scared me more at first but more so now I‚Äôm just profoundly confused. I don't just see the door where it stands now, I see it always in my peripherals like a phantom, when I close my eyes, in my dreams.



My oldest sister lives in California so she offered to pick the boy and I up on her drive to my hometown for the funeral. Hopeful of some family bonding perhaps as I hadn't seen her or her kids in years. A good chance to reconnect a bit while we mourn. However the drive was a solemn one with long stretches of silence. My mind was wandering to odd places for distraction in the form of pointless research rabbit holes.¬†



I spent a comical amount of time reading about Demodex mites. If you don't know about them. Demodex  are microscopic arachnids that live in hair follicles like your eyelashes or the oil glands of humans and other animals. They are approximately 0.2 to 0.06 millimeters big or about the size of a grain of sand, invisible to the human eye. They are transmitted through contact with others. It is estimated that nearly 100% of adults carry Demodex mites. They are considered a natural part of the human skin microbiome and only have a lifespan of 2-3 weeks. But, what are we to the Demodex? Simply washing your body can kill these creatures along with a myriad of others that just live on our bodies, unnoticed. Can such a creature even think? They breed so can it think? Or is it just a purely instinctual existence like running a program? Are we just some living thing they happen to inhabit? They have no eyes but even if they did at that scale could they even tell they in fact live on a much larger creature? If such an insignificant being could even comprehend a god would it think we are God as the Earth itself was once thought to be. We know that Earth is not a god but a living thing. I think we can certainly say it is. Living but not conscious I would say so more plant than animal? Can they comprehend time? Life? Or is it all darkness with a bombardment of senses, rudimentary feelings, and instincts? Do they feel pain or fear? If they did, would it matter? Would it stop me, or you, from forgetting about them tomorrow and going on living normally knowing that by merely being alive we are perpetuating the cycle of life and death on a microscopic scale? No, it wouldn't, it is preposterous to suggest. Instead I used this little bit of research to tease my niece that she has spiders on her face. I imagined hundreds of these little beings writhing in torment and disintegrating into nothingness. Entire generations of them are potentially wiped from existence every time I take a shower. Just as quickly as I had grown interested in the things I was now bored of them and moved on to listening to music the remainder of the trip.



When we arrived I stayed in the old family home for about 2 weeks as we worked out the funeral and her will. It wasn't a complicated matter other than the house. It was not left to anyone in particular, my mother had trusted us to not fight over the estate and we'd work out what we all felt was best. None of us had the energy to make a stink about it. However, there was something that was apparently a hold over from when my dad died. Everything in his study was left to me and he had requested that specifically. When I heard this, something in the back of my brain was tickled. Some lost memory perhaps, but the fresh wounds didn't allow me to pull it from the recesses of the mind.¬†



It was strange being there without her around. Whenever I visited for holidays she would always wake me up for some crazy new breakfast concoction she found online but it was always good. Cooking food for us was one of her greatest pleasures. She preferred not to have help, but if you happened to she certainly ran her kitchen like a tyrant.¬†



But now I'd wake to no enticing aroma and I was never hungry in the morning. I'd walk around my old neighborhood with Diogenes taking my time to head to a nearby coffee shop pretty much burning away the afternoons in a melancholic stupor. It would subside only a bit in the evenings when my sisters, nieces, and nephews would gather for dinner in the family home. It was full of memories and one sister even suggested we just give the house to me altogether since I technically already owned Dad's study. I declined stating it isn't really a home anymore with both of them gone. It would be better to let it go. That night we decided it would be best to sell the house and since my youngest sister was married to a realtor already it wouldn't be hard to set in motion. We were catching up and doing our best to celebrate her memory by remembering all the craziest stories we had of her. My mom was very sociable, kind, non-judgemental, and a bit loony. People loved her. I loved her. Despite that I hadn't cried at all since I got the news but that evening my sisters both lost the battles over their emotions and let a few slip through. I wanted to cry, but something was stopping me. I went to bed that night feeling totally numb.



I haven't had a dream with a girl I liked in it since I was probably in my early teens. I say dream, but, this was a nightmare.



I could see myself in this space but also through my eyes as if I had a second pair, a new perspective. I was laying down on an intricately women tapestry of stick red tendrils of varying sizes. They looked almost like muscle fibers, crimson and pulsating, while feeling offensively sticky to the touch. I had to struggle to break free of them, sitting up alone appeared to take a short eternity. But eventually I fought to my feet and gazed upwards to a black endless sky plastered with stars of frightening sizes ranging from a speck of dust to as big as the moon. Rather than twinkle or radiate constant light in place they blinked and moved about the horizon devoid of any pattern as if examining all below it.



Slowly I began to hear Jenny's voice as if approaching from miles away and I immediately recognized she was screaming. She wasn't scared but in pain. I felt that much as her voice reverberated through my body. I couldn't see her. I had never actually heard her scream before but I knew it was her. Then my perspective shifted once more as if the editor cut to the next scene of a movie. The distant screams now were upon me with brain rattling power.



Jenny was nude, ensnared in the bloody sinews, legs elevated, sweating, her cheeks flushed darker than her hair, her belly full. She was in labor. I was only a few feet away to the side of her. It was just the two of us but I didn't even register with her. She just kept screaming as she struggled to force a new life into being. I walked towards her, I wanted to help, I told my body to run to her but it moved in slow motion. Every inch gained was 90% throwing my arms hard enough my feet were forced to drag through this biological mass at my feet. Making my way towards her I stepped in front of her outstretched legs. Her thighs had covered any sight of her genitals but when I was finally at an angle to see what should have been, well, what would be anatomically correct there was instead a doorknob.¬†



Constructed by some dark greenish metal with signs of aging. It was round with a design that I can only describe as otherworldly. A shape had been created by connecting several small points that dimly shined like little stars. Now that I try to focus, the image is blurry in my mind, but it was indeed a star shape of some kind; a constellation perhaps with. But no matter what point you started from, the eye was eventually drawn to the center of it and seamlessly merged in a keyhole unlike any I had ever seen before forming a perfect spiral.



I was so distracted by this design and how this knob appeared to just fuse into Jenny's pelvic floor that I didn't register her convulsions had intensified and though I could see she was in more anguish than ever her screams had become muffled as if my ear were stuffed with cotton as a deep longing feeling washed over me to touch it. As I raised my hand to do so, I saw, before I felt a key in my hand. A red tendril coiled like a spring jutting out from what I could feel was akin to a chunk of beef, warm and slimy between my fingers. I froze for a moment, my hand hovering the key over its intended purpose.¬† The key was moving, stretching outwards towards the doorknob then recoiling back like a snake ready to strike as the meaty chunk between my fingers pulsed with life. Whatever I held in my hand was alive, it had intent. It was trying to communicate, claws under my skull carved words unintelligible into my subconscious. I couldn't understand, but I knew whatever it wanted wasn't good for Jenny.



Jenny had stopped screaming. She was now silent and looking directly at me, her cheeks still flushed, eyes bloodshot and brimming with tears. I would not give this thing what it wanted. It was then I felt another hand wrap around mine, mimicking my grasp on the key. A person pressing their body up to mine gently as if embracing a lover. I turned my head and locked eyes with myself. Fully exposed and a perfect mirror double in every way but its eyes. I have looked at myself in the mirror before, obviously, I know what I look like. The eyes were off. I have blue eyes, his were too, yet colder, pupils dilated with madness.



Jenny spoke, ‚ÄúTrent? Is that you‚Äù?



But I couldn't break eye contact with the other me as his grip tightened and the key seemed to wriggle with pleasure as he said, ‚ÄúUntangle her thread and we'll try again‚Äù.



He forced my hand. The tendrils squirmed into their anointed crevice and appeared to turn and unlock the knob on their own not with a click but a crack so loud Jenny's spine must have been twisted like a wet towel, that wrung out a scream of pain so haunting it pierced my soul. I begged her forgiveness.¬†



Her living shackles gave way opening a pit and she fell downwards into another sky of sinister stars. I followed, rather was pushed off the precipice by a firm hand on my back. I landed beside her on one of the stars. It was bright, but soft and wet. I knelt beside her as she wriggled around like a dying fish as her eyes rolled back into her head hiding their lovely green. All white and red, more white now, foam mixed with blood boiled out of every orifice. I was the one screaming now. I tried to pull her close to hug her, to cradle her head and tell her it would be okay. To stay with me. But my arms, my damn arms were suddenly too weak to lift her. I could only watch. I looked upwards at the other me far above staring down at poor Jenny. As I felt the life slowly leave her body, this monster, this me, his expression began to change as he rose higher and higher above me but growing ever larger and more dominating till his body encompassed the sky itself. Far beyond my reach but he could easily hold the world in the palm of his hand. Jenny died in my arms. I felt it. I knew it. I killed her.¬†



Drenched in sweat, I sat up in my childhood bed. Grabbing my phone I saw it was a few minutes past 3AM. I sniffled and realized with a wipe of my back hand that I had a bloody nose and I heard a faint whine. Diogenes was on the end of the bed looking at me. His yellow eyes fixed on me as he nudged me with his nose.



‚ÄúIt's okay buddy, it's okay‚Äù. I gave him a quick scratch then made my way to the bathroom to clean myself off and plug my nose with toilet paper. Diogenes followed me around as I got a glass of water then stumbled back into bed. He took his normal station not on the bed but at the foot of it. My noble protector as ever. It took me a while to fall back asleep. I only got about another hour when I did. I couldn't get the image out of my mind. The other me. As poor Jenny suffered. He was smiling. Smiling the whole damn time she was dying.



The next two nights weren't much better but I persevered till the day of the funeral. I saw it for the first time that morning. I was on my walk with Diogenes to get a morning coffee, the same route I had taken my whole stay. I hadn't been drinking at all but felt something akin to a hangover. Likely from the lack of sleep. I was still having nightmares but couldn't recall these ones. I had my headphones in, since I got the news a few different albums were basically playing on repeat in a futile attempt to drown out or at least comprehend the torrent of emotions. We were just walking, then Diogenes stopped as he does. I did too, half paying attention from the corner of my eye expecting him to do his little sniff and dance before pissing, shitting, or whatever.¬†



I stood in place through a whole song before I realized he hadn't moved. His ears were pricked up, head and tail down with his little snout pointing like an arrow down the driveway of a house with a for sale sign. It appeared just to the right side of the garage. A poor design choice that barely fits esthetically but functional at least. A greenish wooden door, paint faded; and the more I looked the more noticeable its asymmetry became to levels of Dr. Caligari, also it had no handle?¬†



Diogenes was transfixed on the strange door. Kind of like when he would see another person walking a dog in the distance he was wary of. I paused my music¬†



‚ÄúDiogenes? Sup buddy?‚Äù I leaned to scratch the base of his tail. One of his sweet spots. He didn't move. The door was weird for sure and I felt the urge to examine it closer. I only took a few steps when I was tugged back.¬†



Diogenes refused to move any closer. I tried to walk forward again but he sat his fluffy ass right down and made it clear he would go no further. I took the hint and we moved on along our route which he gave no objections to. On the walk back I didn't see the door again nor was I even thinking about it and Diogenes didn't act out at all either. It slipped from my mind completely.



The funeral was at 2. My sisters and I¬† all gave a short recollection of my Mother. The venue was small and we honestly didn't expect so many attendees. But there were plenty. I met probably 50 people that said she helped them, was a friend, that I had never met before or heard of from other states and totally different walks of life. It made me proud she was my Mother. She was such an open, caring person. She could effortlessly bring people together. It became a bit too overwhelming for me and I had to break off to the restroom just to step away from the noise and splash my face with some cold water.



I wondered‚Ä¶ Was I even her son? Suddenly I was wondering if I could even live up to her memory. I certainly hadn't felt I'd lived up to my father's so far. She was empathetic, outgoing, and to say she was amicable would be an insult. My Father was erudite, concise, and profound. What was I? Unpolished? Egregious? Perfunctory? I would have to do better. I splashed my face once more and looked at myself in the mirror. But the eyes in the reflection weren't my own. They were his, but more upsetting than that was that the stall directly behind him was the same door I had seen that morning. I turned around in a panic and instinctively threw my arms up in defense and practically jumped up into the sink. But everything was normal. A couple of deep breaths summoned a bit more courage and turned back to my reflection. The door was gone. I was me.



My brother in law, the realtor, stepped into the restroom.¬†



‚ÄúTrent? You good? Your sisters said you disappeared and I'm the search party.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, just needed some‚Ä¶ fresh air.‚Äù



‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù He exhaled sharply, ‚ÄúHey, since you‚Äôre staying there I assume you started looking through some of your dad's things right? I know your sisters have been going through things too before we put it on the market you know. If ya need help going through anything I'm glad to.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, sorry, I haven't made a big dent on that one. I promise I'll come back before the end of the year for a weekend or something to go through it all. I'll give you the copy I am using before I leave too since you'll probably need it.‚Äù



‚ÄúNah, hold onto it. Your sister has a copy I can duplicate if I need it. Is your house still till it sells as far as I'm concerned.‚Äù



It wasn't until he mentioned it that I realized I hadn't been in my Dad's study at all since I came home. The mere idea was akin to entering a crypt or sacred temple. In fact, I couldn't recall the last time I had even been in my Dad's study since he died. I honestly think the last time anyone had been in his study was after it was ransacked when the whole family helped clean it up. We did our best to put everything back where dad had left it best to our knowledge. I'm pretty positive once my mom confirmed it was just how he would have liked it she shut the door and no one ever opened it again. I realized whenever I read any of his work I always found it online when I could have just walked into his study the whole time.



With that settled, unprompted he gave me a quick hug. ‚ÄúI'm real sorry bud. But they told me I can't come back without you.‚Äù¬†



I rode back with my sister and her family back to Vegas 2 days later. She and her husband in front with the tikes properly strapped in behind and Diogenes and I once again lounged in the back with the luggage as pillows like desperate hitchhikers. Actually it wasn't as uncomfortable as you might think. Things were a bit more lively now. The family had been granted some real time to grieve but the psychic stench of sadness still permeated off all of us.



We were only about an hour out when we made a stop at a gas station. It would be our last chance to stop for hours before seeing any sign of civilization. I decided to hop out the back and head in to grab a little something for myself and maybe some cheese. Diogenes loves cheese. I settled on some beef jerky, a proper snack that I never buy unless on a road trip.



My sister and her husband were still shopping with the kids and wrangling them in and out of the restroom so I was the first one in the parking lot. I was chewing a particularly succulent slab of teriyaki, salty goodness when I reached the back of the car and noticed Diogenes was sitting, alert, and staring right past me. Food was clearly visible in my hands and him not being the least bit interested was a clear indicator something was amiss.



I followed his gaze past the fuel pumps to the other side of the street. A family, with a van packed full, presumably moving, was being squeezed back into their seats with fast food bags and drinks in hand, along with a little chihuahua yapping up a storm.¬†



Okay, no surprise, the boy loves other dogs and he always wants to say hello. He has more in common with my mom than I do it seems in terms of making friends. I was about to swing open the trunk when the family finished entering their vehicle and I saw what was behind the kids, the parents, and the dog. On the front of an audacious burger chain were glass double doors. A bit to the side of them, now visible as they began to drive off was the door. That ethereal green door. With faded paint molting off of ancient, damaged wood. Now‚Ä¶ again keep in mind the design of the fast food joint had glass double doors, in fact pretty much the entire building except for maybe about 3 or 4 feet rising from the foundation was made of glass. But there was this shitty, asymmetrical, wooden door with no handle built directly into it somehow only a few feet away from the normal entrance. I saw it twice in one day, the day of the funeral, but not the next. Because why would I? It was fine, a hallucination, the product of bad sleep. It was this time too, it wasn't real, it couldn't be real, and it definitely, absolutely, is not following me.



‚ÄúCan you help me get the kids in their car seats Trent‚Äù?



I nearly jumped out of my skin, as my sister stumbled out of the gas station, kids in toe. She gestured to the youngest of the ragamuffins for aid. I stuttered and looked back to the door. But it wasn't there, the titular Fatty Factory was perfectly normal.



‚ÄúYeah sure, come‚Äôere kiddo‚Äù. I locked a little one in their car seat. I looked back. Nothing. Diogenes still acted a bit anxious. Happy for attention from others but would occasionally look back toward where the door had been as well. We started on our journey back home but both Diogenes and I huddled in the back looking away to where the door had been. But there is no door. There can't be because no one else can see it. Well no human at least. Was that why the other dog was yapping? I took everything in my power to push the door from my mind. I won't see it again.



When I got back to Vegas I wasn't feeling much better but being back home, some place familiar, and focusing on my regular routine could help. It was Thursday and I thought best to go right back to work and finish the week off to help keep my mind busy. I hadn't told anyone at work why I took time off and I prefer it that way. I don't need people I don't really know or feel any kinda way about reaching out and giving me their condolences. Every lull in the work day would just lead to more time with my thoughts anyway and having others remind me on top of that would be far too exhausting. But I felt a slight lift in spirit. Fridays are when I normally go to the bar and see Jenny. Certainly just seeing her could revive some faith in humanity. I tied all the loose knots as Diogenes‚Äô patiently sat by the door as programmed into him via an internal clock by now. He watched me scurry about making sure not to forget anything and that I didn't completely resemble the zombie all this shit was making me feel like.¬†



We took our sweet time walking there and when I arrived I was greeted by a familiar hostess who promptly stepped out from behind her podium and knelt to ruffle the boy's fur around his neck.



‚ÄúHiiii, where have you two been? Oh we missed you baby.‚Äù Her eyes never left Dio as she made a kissy face with exaggerated baby talk.



‚ÄúYeah, we were out of state for a bit on some family business.‚Äù



‚ÄúA trip? A doggy trip? How dare you leave without telling me.‚Äù She gave him one last ruffling and began to make her way back to her post, ‚ÄúI'll get you a table. Jenny is here today, she seems to be having something of an off day.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù



‚ÄúActing like a Rookie. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you. If ya ask me‚Ä¶‚Äù She gestured in a manner implying Jenny was potentially under the influence of the devil‚Äôs lettuce.



I chuckled, being trusted to not be a snitch feels pretty good. I reflected for a second though. Did Jenny know I liked her? It seemed the hostess did. I thought I hadn't done anything really obvious. Did everyone know?



‚ÄúI'm not picky or anything. Wherever you have room for us is fine. If she‚Äôs already having it rough, don't want to make it worse.‚Äù



‚ÄúIf she has trouble serving you two then she‚Äôs a lost cause.‚Äù



The hostess smirked as she marked off a table and led me to my designated spot in the corner. I looked over the menu despite already knowing what I was ordering.



‚Äú‚ÄùHiiiii!!‚Äù the boy immediately stood up. Jenny was approaching us. A guttural noise followed. Did he just growl at her? Jenny stopped and threw her hands up as he'd pulled a gun on her.



‚ÄúDiogenes, what are you doing ?That's your friend,‚Äù I patted his head and rustled the fur around his neck. He stopped being so tense. But he turned and looked me dead in the eyes in confused acquiescence. He was normally happy to see her.¬†



‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù She asked, lowering her arms in sheepish surrender. She was as stunning as ever. More so even, she looked flustered certainly but her dress and look felt more exotic than normal. More first date than typical work day attire. It made me nervous in a pleasant way.



‚ÄúWell, that's‚Äù, Suddenly I remembered the dream I had. Jenny's screams. I looked back to the menu in my hand as words got caught in my throat. I became physically unable to speak.¬†



‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ Just dealing with some stuff but I'll get over it‚Ä¶ Later.‚Äù



‚ÄúTalking about it might help. Especially to me, I'm something of an empath.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh my god shut up,‚Äù I chuckled.



She giggled ‚ÄúEither way the offer is on the table. What can I get ya.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell the usual I guess.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo a bourbon on the rocks.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat? No.‚Äù



‚ÄúSorry, right. An IPA.‚Äù



‚ÄúIPA? Carbonated ass tar?



She fake scribbled on a notepad, ‚ÄúTwo‚Ä¶ IPAaas‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúA pint of the House Orange please.‚Äù



‚ÄúOoohhhh, that's right‚Äù She winked at me, took my menu, spun on her toes, then glided to the bar. The boy relaxed after a bit then laid down.



I worked through that first beer like a man on a deadline. As I sipped on my second the place became a little barren. I guessed there weren't any games or big events going on. I don't follow any sports or find them that entertaining, I just know it is always busier when there is something. I prefer it when it is a bit quieter. So I didn't mind.



Jenny walked up and let me know she was getting cut but could still order and asked if I wanted to close a tab with her or have it transferred to the bar. I said I could close out with her. I knew if I didn't she didn't see a cent of whatever tip I left later. Something I had learned through occasional eavesdropping. I signed the check, told her to have a good evening, and she scampered off.¬†



I thought to myself that it was short lived when Jenny ran back with a hoodie on and a purse around her arm.¬†



‚ÄúI'm sorry, I couldn't leave without saying goodbye. How could I not? Would it be okay if I joined you?‚Äù



I was shocked, never had she suggested such a thing. Maybe my luck will turn around. Is this what they call the wheel fortune? The swing of the pendulum? Tragedy begets happiness?



‚ÄúPlease do, some company would be nice.‚Äù



Jenny slid into the seat opposite me. Diogenes seemed almost offended. He got to my feet, faced her then laid down his head resting on my sneaker. She gave an audible ‚Äúaww‚Äù at him.



This is where things become a blur. Her voice hits my ears like a good Q-tip. She is energetic, quirky, cute, seems to say all the right things, and is a bundle of giggles. I can't recall the last time we talked for so long, nor the last time I gave such a hearty laugh. She was always a bit of a jokester but was acting so weird today and more talkative. It was refreshing. The laughter seemed to ease pains in my heart and I was grateful.



Eventually It happened. I spilled that my mom had passed. I was having such fun but the hurt was too recent and I couldn't fully hide my sadness and Jenny saw that. She apologized profusely, asked me about her and listened as I spouted something of a second eulogy on the spot. She said she sounded wonderful and that she thought they would get along. I agreed.¬†



She eventually pulled herself away. Said she shouldn't keep me long and that she had something to take care of that day. How long had we talked? I had no idea but it was nice. If I didn't have an honest to god crush on her before, I did now. I had it bad.



I noticed though that Diogenes was alert. He was now to my side. Sitting down staring off outside. I thought some people caught his interest, birds, maybe even a cat, but when I followed his gaze I saw it. Across the street smack dab in the middle between a Vietnamese Pho restaurant and a Shoe Store was an oddly shaped blue wooden door. That door. There was no mistaking it.



‚ÄúWhat's wrong?‚Äù Jenny asked, tracing my gaze but seemingly confused.¬†



‚ÄúNothing, I should really go but this has been nice. I think I needed it.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell I'll be here Thursdays through Tuesdays this month. You should stop in. Maybe spend more time together.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I was a mess of feelings. Here I was being, dare I say, courted? By my crush? But all I can think about is this door. Why is it here again? I decided I absolutely needed to leave, get some sleep. My mind was playing tricks on me. Jenny was the definition of grace on top of being understanding and radiant. The vibe we had established was good. No. Excellent but seeing the door killed any romantic or lustful urge within me instantly. We said our goodbyes and Diogenes and I began to make our trek back home. As I exited the bar I looked over and noticed the door was now gone. Maybe I was hallucinating. But also that was impossible. Because the dog saw it too, or sensed it. No way my hallucinations were rubbing off on him. Contagious? I pondered my mental state the whole walk home. 



As I unlocked the door to the apartment Diogenes seemed antsy. I got the door open and stepped into darkness as Diogenes immediately barked with a fervor like he never had. Hurriedly, I switched on the lights half expecting to find a burglar in all black carrying my tv or something. But what was actually there was worse. There in my apartment, in a place that in no way could it perform its designed function, was the green, beaten, wooden door.

1n3ioqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1n3ioqz/i_think_im_growing_out_of_my_closest_friendship/,I think I'm growing out of my closest friendship,"I feel like I'm starting to dislike my only close friend. so, let's say her name is Julia, and we're both 16. at first we were in a trio, but the 3rd girl left and we had a drama. so since last year we've just been together. we're both pretty shy, so we're not the most outgoing people ever, and even though we'd like to have more friends, we're just both too shy to just go to someone and start a conversation without feeling awkward. in my case, I even feel weird during convos with other people, and I just don't know what to say. I don't like to talk about simple things like classes, school or whatever. I like to talk about deeper things. like, moral dilemmas, theories, something we both enjoy. of couse I know other people too besides my best friend, but the problem is that with them, I can just do small talks and I don't really see a chance of becoming closer friends. so I'm pretty stuck with Jullia. the problem is, Julia started to really annoy me. she's that type of person that always complains and does nothing. like, for example, she knows she has to get up early at 5am, but yet she stays up until 2/3am, the next day the only thing she does is complain about how tired she is, and she calls her parents to pick her up from school. and she's just lazy. I'm not saying I'm the most productive person here, but Julia's laziness is really annoying me. she also seems foggy, never concentrated on anything, just on pleasure. I'm a very expressive person, so I express my emotions clearly. and let's say I don't deal well with people who just complain and do nothing. so when we have to do something, I do it, and Julia just complains. and when I tell her to start doing something, she says I'm always mad. I'm not mad, I'm just tired of babysitting her like her mom. she is so irresponsible. like, there have been multiple times where she left her jacket or another object in another class. once she even left her phone in the corridor and she found out after few minutes of already being in class. she even bought coffee and couldn't even walk well on the stairs and she spilled the whole coffee. for her, being late isn't a problem. and many other things. you know, my mom is the principal of the school and my dad is a teacher, so I need to be extra cautious of what I'm doing in class because I don't want teachers to spread bad rumors about me and I don't want to bring ""shame"" to my mom. she also comes up with crazy ideas, like ""let's go to another city and skip class"". I literally can't. I sometimes think that she just wants to do irresponsible stuff, but she doesn't want to do this alone not to feel irresponsible, and she knows that I'm more mature than her so if I agree to do smth of her ideas, she'll feel like it's ok. I'm tired of her. few months ago when school was about to finish, she said she was too lazy to go to classes because ""it didn't make sense coming to school today"" (we had 2 polish classes and 2 math classes, we'll have to take an exam of those subjects). she always thinks nothing makes sense. and the worst thing? her parents don't even ""raise"" her, they just let her do anything she wants. another thing. if you have high notes, you can get a scholarship. this year, Julia had high notes (but not because she studied, because she cheated on almost every exam) so technically, she could get a scholarship. she needed to correct only 1 note to be able to get a scholarship. so she went to the teacher to ask if she can have a higher note, and the teacher told her no, and she was shocked, because she did everything the teacher said. wanna know why the teacher didn't wanna give her a higher note? because sure, Julia did everything the teacher wanted, but she did it after 3 MONTHS. 3 FUCKING MONTHS. and it's not like she had a serious problem and couldn't make this task. no, she was just lazy. also, I would say that this teacher is really nice to us, and she says that you have 2 WEEKS to give her a task. 2 weeks, and she gave it back after 3 MONTHS. and then Julia was surprised why she won't get a scholarship. isn't it irresponsible? and fucking lazy to give a simple task after 3 damn months? also, I just feel like I don't wanna meet her. like, it's vacation, it's been 2 months since I'd seen her, and I don't even miss her. not even a little bit. also, I even feel ""Drained"" knowing that I have to come back to school and having to spend time with her every single day. there's also another thing. a guy named Krystian. he's Julia's friend, and they've known each other since 6 years, Julia has known me for 2 years. Krystian is really a nice guy, he's funny and everything, he's a gay and a nice person generally. I knew that they're always gonna be closer because they've clearly known each other much longer, but I feel sick of Julia always talking to me about Krystian. she always says how nice it was to see him, to have fun, how many adventures they had together. I actually feel sick. she always complains about how she has no friends, but she has fucking more friends than I. I sometimes feel like if she could choose with whom she could be always friends with, she would choose Krystian. Ok, they're close to wach other, I get it. but everytime she tells me about him, I feel left out. like I'm the backup friend, when logically, I shouldn't feel like this because I'm her only friend at school. but we very rarely make plans to see each other, and usually we never do what we planned. but you know who she loves to see? Krystian. we even made a group on messenger last year with Krystian, and we used to chat, but then we stopped. Idk why, we just did. but you know when the chat finally got life again? when Julia met Krystian and started sending photos and videos of each other how much fun they have. you know, my mom always used to be a little overprotective towards me, since she always heard brutal stories of kidnapping young girls. she's even more overlysensitive to this topic, because she knows a man whose daughter was kidnapped and sold to a gogo club or smth like that. so my mom usually just wants to reassure that people I'm friends with don't have bad intentions towards me. somehow, she always feels if a person gives off good/bad vibes. everytime she told me a person gave of bad vibes, she was right. always. and once I told Julia about my mom's fear. and remember when Julia started sending the videos of her and Krystian in the chat group? they started making fun of my mom and her fears. for them it was funny, but for me it was just disrespectful towards my mom. my mom might have some irrational fears like every parent I guess, but she's not a bad person. also, I think like Julia loses her personality when she's with Krystian, and she takes his personality instead. like, Krystian has some special vocabulary he uses, and that's ok because it matches his gay vibe. but Julia starts to copy him, and sometimes I really feel like I'm talking not to Julia, but to Krystian trapped in a female body. it's weird and annoying. during vacation, we never met each other bacause we were both on vacation, but she always told me how much fun she had with Krystian. it's just tiring. I don't even wanna talk to her. I feel like this friendship is going to finish sooner or later. I'm just stuck with her because I have no other friends. everything about her starts to annoy me. the way she behaves, talks, does nothing and complains about everything. she even invited me to an entertainment park. I really didn't even wann spend time with her, so I just said I can't because blah blah blah, I didn't even ask my parents for permission. but guess who she took to the entertainment park? Krystian. I really think that she invited me just out of politeness, but secretly she jus hoped I would say no so that she can spend time with Krystian. also, my parents said Julia gives off bad vibes. fucking perfect. my only friend gives off bad vibes. amazing. also, she was many times in my house, and my mom always prepared us delicious food, snacks, everything was perfect because my mom wnated us to have a great time and didn't want us to lack smth. as I said before, both of my parents work at school. they don't teach Julia, but they see each other in the corridor. you know, politeness tells you to say hello to the teachers. I do it, because my parents raised me like this. Julia doesn't. I don't really care if she says hello or not to the teachers, but she doesn't even greet my parents. like, you know, she just looks at them and says nothing. Like, she was in my house, they're npt just teachers, they're my parents, \*her friend's parents\* and she just ignores them. isn't it weird? but I'm sure that she would definitely, gladly say hello to Krystian's parents. anyway, sorry for such a long text, I just needed to vent and let this all out.",1,1756500171.0,venting,1,1.0,False
1n3io4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1n3io4u/mixed_faith_marriage/,Mixed Faith Marriage,"I met my husband in high school and converted to the LDS church right before we got married (not in the temple).

Looking back, I regret that decision. I feel like I wasn't informed enough to, to realize what I was doing. I was doing the right thing for the wrong reason. What I did was for love and doing something for someone else. After we got married, we went to church together for a while, but when I got pregnant and started having complications, we stopped attending. Neither of us received any callings or anything during that time. Then life happened. Moving, COVID, raising kids, and seven years went by without going to church.

Since I didn‚Äôt grow up Mormon, things like tattoos, piercings, alcohol, coffee, and tea were always just normal, not ‚Äúbad.‚Äù During those years away, my husband and I tried alcohol, drank coffee, and he even got a tattoo. I honestly hoped that through those experiences he‚Äôd see it‚Äôs okay to live life without so many restrictions.

But after the April 2025 conference, he started listening again and felt prompted to return to church. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve found a different church I love, and our kids sometimes go with me and sometimes with him.

Since then, I‚Äôve done a lot of research into the LDS church, and what I‚Äôve learned really bothers me. I also didn‚Äôt grow up in a church, so I‚Äôve been able to explore my faith freely and ask my own questions‚Äîwhich has brought me peace with my decision not to go back. It‚Äôs hard to watch my husband being pulled in again, because to me, it feels like conditioning.

I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôm okay with attending church separately and growing in faith together in our own ways, but he feels like we‚Äôre missing out as a family by not doing this all in the same church and pursuing the idea of being ‚Äútogether forever.‚Äù I‚Äôve had to let go a bit and allow the kids to go with him, even though part of me wants to protect them.

He‚Äôs told me that the LDS faith goes ‚Äúbeyond the Bible,‚Äù but that‚Äôs not something I believe. He‚Äôs been back for just a few months and already paid his tithing, received his temple recommend, his Melchizedek priesthood, and his patriarchal blessing. After being gone for years, it feels like he just had to pay his dues to check the boxes.

I don‚Äôt even know exactly what I‚Äôm looking for by posting this. Maybe I just hope to hear from someone else in a similar situation. Or something that will open his eyes to the truth.",12,1756500131.0,exmormon,6,1.0,False

It really feels like it.,"I (17 turning 18 in a couple weeks) am dating this really kind, extremely intelligent, empathetic, trustworthy, cute and honest guy (19m).

We‚Äôve known each other through band since I was a freshman. But we got to know each other over the summer when I thought it would be a good idea to get to know some of the alumni, and we went to coffee as friends for a couple weeks.

Our conversations were long and deep (philosophy, life goals, politics, beliefs) and 2 hours would pass by with him in no time.

Eventually I started wondering if he liked me, I wasn‚Äôt sure yet. So I asked him and he said yes, and we started dating around the 4th of July. Even before our official date, we couldn‚Äôt be apart lol.

I remember the first time we held hands while driving around he asked for consent and I said absolutely, and everything felt right in the world.

He‚Äôs so respectful of me and my boundaries and beliefs and values and everything. Not only that but he goes above to call me every day, get me flowers (even though I got some for him too lol) and met all of my family.

I remember our first kiss, sitting on the docs on the lake and our first time..

He met my mom, stepdad, sister, stepsister and both my grandma and grandpa and they all love him almost as much as I do. My grandma even invited him and I to dinner for their 55th anniversary. Which was really special.

I love his family and I think the like me. I‚Äôm over at his house a lot and his mom and dad talk to me every chance they get and we have interesting conversations.

A couple dates later we became official. And you may be thinking this was fast. But it flowed so naturally and everything felt right.

We are almost to September and still going strong.

But he has to go back to college, and it makes me nauseous not seeing him as often because he literally came so unexpectedly and this has been the best summer ever.

Last night we went on one of our last drives for the summer and we listened to our favorite album and he told me he would remember this forever, and I started to cry and I looked over and tears were streaming down his face as well.

We both went home crying and I told my mom (I was feeling kinda crazy) that it makes me nauseous imagining a life where we aren‚Äôt  life partners. We have shared so many of our intimate values and thoughts and worries with each other that we are so connected in all ways.

We are going to make it work.

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I‚Äôm in love and I feel like I met my person.",20,1756499994.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,28,0.88,False

So what computer should I get for this? Aside from some other very minor, lightweight things, this is literally all the computer will be used for. 

* Must run windows
* Ideal screen size is about 13-14"" screen (I say ideal because I know there are more options in the 15"" range)
* Compact is good because I don't want more crap on my desk. But I won't pay much extra for compact. Just a plus.
* Nothing with crap build quality. Doesn't need to be top notch as it won't be leaving my desk much, but I don't want squeaky plastic garbage.
* I can definitely get away with 16gb RAM, but more is better
* Processor can't suck, we have some CPU intensive things running on the site. But, it doesn't need to be blazing fast, this is a single-purpose computer.
* Must have at least 256GB of SSD. 500gb-1TB is ideal. Our database is big and is quickly growing.
* Battery life doesn't matter, will almost always be plugged in. 
* Screen quality doesn't matter, it will almost always be on an external monitor.
* Ports don't matter, will almost always be docked.
* No off-brands so that when I work on it at a coffee shop people won‚Äôt think I traded my self-respect for a Groupon deal on sketchy hardware and a warranty that requires sending a handwritten letter to a P.O. box in Belarus.

1n3i3fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RudeSelf3418/comments/1n3i3fl/are_italians_generally_rude_or_is_it_just_venice/,Are Italians generally rude or is it just Venice?,"I was in Venice for a few days. I‚Äôm brown and grew up in Australia. 

I travelled to 3 different countries in Europe. 2 of them, I was treated with so much respect and kindness and I felt so welcomed. But in Venice it was the exact opposite. 

Examples: 
Women in Venice would stare me down and give me the side eye. If I smiled at them they wouldn‚Äôt smile back. Whereas in the other 2 countries (Poland and Portugal) I felt so welcomed and strangers who walked past would smile at me and greet me everywhere I went. 

I was at a store where the staff was so smiley and talkative with all other customers (some were german, some were American, some were french) and when it was my turn to buy the product, she shut down her smile and was so blunt with me. Even though I was the only one buying more products. 

Men here compliment me a lot. But it‚Äôs disgusting. In Portugal I got a lot of compliments but it didn‚Äôt make me feel uncomfortable. They would compliment me and then walk away. Never crossed the line. 

Here in Venice, some waiters while I‚Äôm eating at the restaurant would stand by me and ask me personal questions and ask if I‚Äôm alone here, if I have a boyfriend, tell me I‚Äôm pretty and ask if they can add me on social media, etc. While I‚Äôm trying to enjoy my meal. 

I was in Burano at a cafe and I ordered my coffee. The barista who is probably around 50 was telling me I‚Äôm beautiful. I‚Äôm 27 but I didn‚Äôt think too deep into it because someone telling you you‚Äôre beautiful isn‚Äôt a creepy thing. But then he proceeded to ask me if I have a boyfriend and if I‚Äôm travelling alone, then even though he had made my coffee and I had already paid, he wouldn‚Äôt hand me my coffee until I promised him that I would come back there and have dinner with him. At first I thought he was joking so I laughed it off and tried to take my drink but he pulled the drink away and kept saying ‚Äúpromise me‚Äù. I just wanted my drink so I told him okay and took my drink. I took a different way back home because I was worried I‚Äôd run into him. 

The first day was the worst. On my first day I was going from Mestre to St Mark‚Äôs Square. Since it was my first day in Venice I didn‚Äôt know how to get a ticket from the ticket machine to get on the boat. There was a guy on the ticket machine next to mine so I asked him ‚ÄúHey can you help me? I don‚Äôt know which button to press. I just need a ticket to get to St Marks‚Äù. He was very kind and helped me out and then told me ‚ÄúThe boat will only get here in about 15-20 mins. I‚Äôm about to get coffee, do you want to grab a coffee too?‚Äù and I said sure! I know this may seem stupid but I was coming from Portugal where I would meet genuine kind people like this who would help out, then talk and grab coffee and then would part ways. no expectations or anything. We grabbed a drink from the cafe (which is right next to where we got tickets). Then we got on the boat and he showed me around to some places. Told me which restaurants are nice, which ones to avoid, which icecream shops are the best, etc. 
He then took me to a street and then halfway down the street he stopped and opened the door with keys and said ‚Äúwait here i‚Äôll be back‚Äù. He came back 10 seconds later and said ‚Äúsorry my dad‚Äôs home, let‚Äôs go on the rooftop‚Äù and tried to kiss me. I told him I don‚Äôt want to do anything and that I didn‚Äôt think this was why he was being friendly. He kept saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay just come with me‚Äù, again proceeding to try and kiss me and pulls out a condom. I told him I‚Äôm leaving. Anyway, that‚Äôs for me to talk to my therapist about. 
My friends had similar experiences of men fetishising them for being darker and being told things like ‚Äúi love chocolate‚Äù, ‚Äúcome back to my place‚Äù, ‚Äúyou look exotic‚Äù, etc. 

I felt so much safer in the other countries I‚Äôve travelled to, especially in Asia. And by safe I mean both sexually as well as racially. 

Last example, when I was carrying luggage in Venice and struggling, the locals here would stand there right next to me and watch me struggle. These are grown men which muscles by the way. Not a single local offered to help but watched me. 

In Poland and Portugal (even in UK when i travelled years ago) I never had to struggle with luggage because people would come running from across the street if they saw a girl who is short like me struggling with luggage. 
So in Venice, while the locals were watching and not helping, 3 different people helped me. One was a middle aged Korean man, one was a 78 year old British lady who stopped her photoshoot to offer me help, and another one was a german guy who was there with his wife. 

To be honest, I can even say ‚Äúforget about not having any help‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even expect people to LIKE me. But you don‚Äôt have to like someone to respect them or show kindness. And you definitely don‚Äôt have to look at them like a sex object. 

But yeah, I just wanted to know, are Italians generally considered racist or was it just Venice? 

There are a lot of italians in Australia and to be honest I haven‚Äôt really noticed any blatant racism from them. 
And I hate to generalise a whole group of people. But what I saw in Venice, was genuinely a whole group of people who treated me a certain way and didn‚Äôt make me feel welcomed. 

Whereas Poland, Portugal, UK, Vietnam, etc I felt so welcomed and safe. ",1,1756498749.0,u_RudeSelf3418,0,1.0,False
1n3i36h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n3i36h/find_out_if_the_keurig_kelite_coffee_maker_lives/,Find Out if the Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker Lives Up to Reviews,"The Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker, model number K-Elite, caught my attention as a coffee aficionado always on the hunt for convenience without compromising on taste. This single-serve brewer promised a range of options, from temperature control to iced coffee functionality, all wrapped up in a sleek, brushed slate design. I decided to put it through its paces in my kitchen to see if it lives up to its reputation. With programmable settings and multiple brew size options, it seemed like a versatile addition to my coffee routine, but there were a few quirks to note.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The brushed slate finish of this coffee maker is definitely a head-turner. Its clean, modern aesthetic blended effortlessly with the rest of my kitchen appliances. It's compact enough to fit snugly on the counter without taking up too much space, although it is slightly wider than some other models I‚Äôve used. What I appreciated less, however, was its plasticky feel in some areas, especially the drip tray. At 6.6 pounds, it‚Äôs not overly heavy, which is helpful if you need to move it around occasionally. The removable water reservoir is a great touch, making refills straightforward, but the reservoir latch could have been sturdier.   

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Setting up the machine out of the box was a breeze. The user-friendly buttons on the top panel make brewing practically foolproof, even for beginners. What sold me was the temperature control, offering a range between 187¬∞F and 192¬∞F‚Äîideal for crafting both piping hot and less-intense brews. Another feature I loved was the strong brew button. It genuinely enhanced the boldness of the coffee, perfect for those mornings when I needed an extra kick. 

While I mainly stuck to K-Cup pods, this brewer is compatible with reusable filters for ground coffee, which my eco-conscious friends would love. The ""hot water on demand"" button turned out to be unexpectedly useful for soups and instant oatmeal‚Äîlike having a mini kettle always ready. 

[Grab the Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker here on Amazon for the latest pricing.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b078nn17k3/)

**Iced Coffee Mode**  
The iced coffee function was something new for me. I was skeptical at first, thinking it might just water down the coffee, but the design ensures a strong and flavorful iced coffee when brewed directly over ice. This became a summer lifesaver, and I tested it with both regular and flavored pods to excellent results. My only gripe? It‚Äôs not exactly intuitive to switch between coffee modes and temperatures until you use it multiple times.

**Key Benefits**  
- Excellent temperature control for a customizable coffee experience.  
- Strong brew option significantly enhances flavor strength.  
- Large 75oz water reservoir minimizes frequent refills.  
- Iced coffee mode delivers refreshing results every time.  
- Compact design that fits well in most kitchen setups.  

**Shortcomings**  
While I enjoyed testing this brewer, a couple of details stood out as less favorable:  
- Plastic components in the build detract from the premium feel.  
- Reservoir latch could feel flimsy when frequently removed.  
- Higher noise output compared to some competitors, especially during the brewing cycle.  

**Competing Products**  
It‚Äôs impossible to talk about a single-serve brewer without comparing it to its competitors. Compared to the Nespresso Vertuo, the K-Elite offers more flexibility in brew size and has the added advantage of iced coffee capability. However, the Nespresso excels in delivering a richer crema with every cup, which the Keurig struggles with. There‚Äôs also the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which is comparable in price and offers additional carafe brewing, though its bulkier design isn‚Äôt as aesthetically pleasing as the brushed slate finish of this model.

If you prioritize simplicity and iced coffee, Keurig's offering stands out, but it falls behind in delivering premium espresso-like quality that some of its rivals manage to achieve.

**Affordable Quality**  
While I found the Keurig boasting premium features, its price point falls within the acceptable range for single-serve brewers with its robust feature set. The strong brew button and temperature control add genuine value, unlike some gimmicky options found in competing machines. Is it an investment? Sure, but the time you save in brewing, combined with the consistent quality of brewed coffee, makes it worth considering for daily users like me. It‚Äôs ideal for someone who drinks multiple cups throughout the day. However, if you‚Äôre a rare coffee drinker, the splurge on programmable settings may seem unjustifiable.

I've been with my husband for 6 years now, and most of the time I feel absolutely blessed to be married to this man. He's absolutely amazing - he's confident, tall, he basically livens up every room he goes into, and he's the kindest man I've ever met, to me obviously but to practically everyone we meet. Me on the other hand, I like to think I'm a good person, a good wife, a good mother, but I'm not as outgoing and frankly not as attractive as he is, which he always reassures me isn't an issue. He tells me I'm beautiful and that he loves me, and that he wouldn't pick anyone in the world over me, and I know he means it, but I'm not delusional. I know that when people see us together they wonder what a man like that is doing with someone like me. 

A few weeks ago we've been watching 30 Rock, and while the show is absolutely hilarious, we got to the episode where Liz Lemon is dating John Hamm, and they talk about how he just lives in a completely different world than her, how everything comes easily to him because of how attractive he is, and I (jokinly) told my husband ""See? This is us! You don't realize how differently people treat you because of how hot you are!"" But he actually took it a little hard. He said he couldn't believe this is how I saw him, but I said I did, because he does have pretty privelege, and he's clearly blind to it. I gave him a few examples too.

Like a year ago when our son was still very small I had to make a call from the car, so he said he was taking him to get coffee for us so he doesn't interrupt my call. I asked him if he wanted to take the baby carrier and he said it was fine. It was wild to see - the server was tripping over herself, giggling and playing with our baby, people were helping him get things, helping him carry the drinks, opening the door for him. The server literally walked him to the car, and when she saw me I could see that familiar look of ""oh, I can't believe *that's* his wife"". This is so different from what it's like for me. When I go somewhere with our son I often feel invisible or ignored, while this man will be coming home telling me about how nice and accommodating everyone everywhere is, or how he met the nicest people at the playground and all the noms are so welcoming. 

I see it when we interact with other people too. Like He'll be making faces at random babies and the parents would happily let him, and again I explain to him that this isn't the world the rest of us live in - mothers don't just happily accept strangers making faces at their kids. No one likes strangers interacting with their children. A few times I tried telling him he shouldn't bother people in public and had them tell me that it was totally fine, I was shocked. 

the point is that I see people treat him differently. I see the flirting, the looks, the *thirst* and honestly it just makes me feel absolutely invisible next to him. To clarify - he doesn't engage in flirting as far as I can tell. He's not being weird or evasive with me. He never leads anyone on. I don't think he's cheating or ever has cheated, we even have apps that show us the locations of our cars, so I know it's nothing like that, it's just that he seems to live in an entirely different world than me, and it sometimes feels absolutely frustrating to find myself struggling to juggle my kid with my errands when we're out only to see people trip over themselves to make his life easier, even as no one lifts a finger for me. 

I don't need him to change anything about how he acts, he's clearly doing well, and I'm happy that he has a good time wherever he goes, I just feel like sometimes he doesn't see that this isn't how it is for me. Like if he asks if I'd mind running an errand after work and doesn't understand why it's a big bother for me where it wouldn't be for him. It's because unlike him, no one ever saw me walking in with a baby and immediately demanded everyone let me cut in line. It's absolutely comical how people behave around him, and I just want him to acknowledge that this isn't the norm, or at least not to deny that it happens when I bring it up.",48,1756498605.0,TrueOffMyChest,22,0.83,False
1n3i14k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/comments/1n3i14k/a_long_way_and_rainbows/,A long way and rainbows,"Since April I my work time is reduced (this may be better soon) and I constantly worked on our apartment we love in since nearly 15 years. Except of in total a week I always and everyday work longer than at work. 

A few years ago we had the opportunity to build a house - long story short: with lots of money, time and stress involved it finally DID NOT happen. Since then, we were so exhausted all the time, that we had to push us to meet our friends nearly as often as before Corona. And we barely kept the apartment visitable so to say. 

We like our apartment but more so the area and since the house plans are crushed, I really felt that I didn't want to live somewhere else. Yes, a house for just us would be nice. But I realized I am at home in this area, with this neighbours and opportunities that this neighborhood gives me. 

So I decided to try to make our home more nice, more ours through 'design', more clean and organized to finally feel less of a burden. 

The start was not easy. 
We are two people with a big variety of hobbies that come and go and come back. And we also like to have nice, cute, special (but never expensive) stuff.

So, you can imagine an European apartment with that much stuff is full. Er k√∂nnte of like it. It's our life on display. But to unorganized. With piles.

In the last months I went from one tiny area to another. Put it all out on the floor, sorted and be brutally honest to myself ""Will I really finish this project /wear this skirt ever again/ repair this item?"". This was hard. But got better over time because I took most of the stuff outside to gift away. And it went away. So, people liked it, they may be happy about their find. And this made me happy. Made it easier to let go. And after months I felt a little lighter with every zone I cleared. And sometimes cleared a second time and organized it. 

Two weeks ago I finally felt like I have achieved something. 
Yes, a very long time. But we were so unorganized collectors....
Today I cleaned, scrubbed, washed and vacuumed the bathroom, toilet and kitchen.
The toilet was never a problem. We have guests every other weekend so this place is kept clean. But I repainted the wall after redesigning the tiles a month ago, and made the usual cleaning.

The kitchen on the other hand. Of course the stove, pans and utensils are clean - I cook everyday. But handles and a tile ledge and the outside of some containers or the coffee machine (the outside!) were so layered in this steamed on grease from cooking (and I cook only with minimum fat, no fryer or so) .... This was hardcore but I finally got it and also mopped the kitchen floor. 
  And there the light came through this small patch of funny window cling foil and created rainbows on the floor. 

A long journey, still not perfect with lots of things but today I got a reward. And partner mentioned how fantastic it is what I do.

The smell of cleaning supplies is still intense but for the next time I think I will be satisfied with what I did. 

Thank you for reading and I'm happy that I found this and similar subs, that may have gotten me the energy in the last weeks to still power through this chaos.",3,1756498595.0,ufyh,1,1.0,False

We have the desire card or known as the wish card. This talks about wish fulfillment. things are going whatever it is that you have been wanting will happen for some of you. It‚Äôs going to be an upgraded car for some of you. This is actually seeing an old friend that gave you money. Gave you a loan or simply they just defended you a lot in your early years or they did do a lot of favors
This is also telling me that a lot of you probably deal with abandonment wounds, or you have other wounds when it comes to your independence also because of the fact that you were never allowed to be a child your parents never took care of you or they were very neglectful and very abusive in someway And it tells me that for some of you very specifically, you guys moved away or just have completely not talked to these people anymore be proud of yourselves because it seems like you‚Äôre actually breaking a lot of generational patterns of abuse there was a lot of injustice not with your parents, but in work score, and in many other places, a good color for you to tap into would be sky blue you will start to meet open-minded people, and you‚Äôre gonna have inspiration when it comes to your outfits when it comes to a side hustle, and when it comes to your food or like you‚Äôre gonna start customizing your a lot more important last thing there will be an expansion in your wealth and in your truth there is someone here that wants you to be quiet because they betrayed you secret power speak your truth therefore, the power of the secret will be broken. Otherwise, if you choose to stay silent, it could result in more betrayal. Also get ready because you‚Äôre definitely going to have a much softer life over the next couple of days and weeks and probably for the rest of the year and prepare for a lot more dinner dates or coffee dates whether that be with yourself for other people.

All right now for pile two we have the witchcraft card is first of all if you guys could be readers or you practice a lot of spell it tells me that you guys need to incorporate love more and I don‚Äôt mean romantically I mean from your heart from the heart chakra into your every day life into your manifestation and everything that you do it also tells me here that a lot of you are going to step into a more seductive energy. It‚Äôs also very possible that a lot of you could have recently had like dreams that were very weird or that brought up old wounds may be of school or jobs. Just so you guys know you will be having a fresh start. You will also be having support from a friend a person or parents that will help you get into some sort of school university or some sort of apartment.
But your gateway will open also keep hearing something about a down payment or loan Some of you need to step more into your creativity get back to your dancing to your singing to having more fun and let go of any addictions or devices that you‚Äôre engaging in keep your balance. I‚Äôm seeing someone with blonde hair and they have like a black purse, and their shoes are white.
