1i4899o,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1i4899o/the_trade_system_will_not_be_fixed_until_the/,The trade system will not be fixed until the economy system is fixed,"Trade in any coherent economic model is ultimately an expression of said model. It tells you when and how trade happens between countries. The economic model of Vic3 is most applicable to the classic trade theory models of Ricardo and in some very minor part the Heckscher-Ohlin model. In the Ricardo model, trade happens because goods have different inherent production costs between countries, leading to both absolute and relative advantages in production costs. This allows different countries to specialise into different products, where with trade the overall utility rises.

The game fails in this regard with how the game has broadly similar per good production costs for goods for all PMs. Even if we include the abundant Throughput Bonuses, this changes little with how they decrease the per-unit cost very little. This means that there is never any pressure on local production to actually specialise, because they cannot be outcompeted, ever. 

The other issue is that consumers (i.e. Pop Consumption) do not react to prices to switch consumption, but are driven by the ""production"" of goods within a market. [I already wrote about this in a past post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1f7g0ku/how_the_supplybased_pop_demand_is_harming_the_game/) Let's say you are Colombia and produce a whole load of Coffee. You want to export said good to Scandinavia, however because they do not natively produce Coffee, regardless of how cheap it is they will never switch over to Coffee. This is a core issue for most consumption goods. Notice how Meat is consistently unprofitable? Meat has very low weight in the Simple Foods Consumption Basket, which means even if a rational consumer would switch from expensive Grain to cheap Meat, they will never do so.

Per game design, these two factors lead to the economy design to be autarchic. On the one hand there are no competitive advantages to exploit, while on the other new consumer goods can rarely get a hold of a market share, if there isn't already an existing market in the first place.",1,1737209268.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

# Beginnings

Tyla Laura Seethal started out in South Africa (thank you [u/flavasavavandal](https://www.reddit.com/user/flavasavavandal/)), finding her passion for music before her teen years by uploading original songs and [covers by other artists online](https://youtu.be/WOdh2RjoU0E?si=n7p85CnBL_nIB7F6). Shortly after graduating high school and being discovered by her first manager from her videos is when she took her love for music to a higher level. Self-releasing her debut single ""Getting Late"" in 2019 at 17 years old, Tyla saw a notable amount of eyes on her. [The accompanying music video](https://youtu.be/v6Tct3AAre0?si=8BElN75C_d8TU810) released during the COVID-19 pandemic gained hundreds of thousands of views at the time, landing her not only a South African Music Awards Nomination, but also a record deal with Epic in the U.S.

# International Breakthrough

Due to signing onto Epic Records, Tyla received the opportunity to work with several producers outside of South Africa, including among the U.S.; doing so led to her releasing [Been Thinking](https://youtu.be/i7jSoCzxC0I?si=FB7lvd_Ol1kR41m8) as her first single (not affiliated with any piece in media) since signing onto Epic. The song became her first entry on a U.S. Billboard Chart. While audiences in the U.S. were starting to grab on to Tyla, she still didn't have a strong foothold on Westerners as she was still a niche figure at the time... that is, until she released another particular single the same year a few months later.

As most people reading this know by now, ""[Water](https://youtu.be/XoiOOiuH8iI?si=5zvcpvysI0opOblG)"" was really the track that put Tyla on many people's radars from a multitude of different countries. The song had a generally steady increase, including in the U.S.. ""Water"" first started gaining traction on TikTok as a dance trend before eventually appearing on the Bubbling Under. Afterwards, it slowly climbed its way to the top 10 of the Hot 100 in 3+ months (as well as nearly Top 5 on the Global 200). ""Water"" ended up reaching #24 and #18 on the 2024 Year-End Charts of the Hot 100 and Global 200 respectively. Since then, Tyla went from being a moderately popular singer among South Africans to having one of the biggest songs from Africa of the past few years.

# The Sound of Tyla the Artist

With crossing over to a wider scale, Tyla's had a generally wide range of acts to look to for reference geographically speaking to help shape her sound as an artist so far. Some of the more notable acts include Wizkid, Rihanna, and Beyoncé to look up to for the sake of global appeal as well as South African artists such as [Afro fusion band Freshlyground](https://youtu.be/DGXit3XJAgE?si=hYnOR-26cZl_FvZa), [Pop singer Shekhinah](https://youtu.be/dVXgo7-8OlA?si=5y4ulrQ0yP7_C9Ih), and [House producer Black Coffee](https://youtu.be/n7HHTgCIjh0?si=wv3VPRKQzsnvw2O6) to define Tyla's sound in terms of genre-fusions while appealing to pop-sensibilities.

^(Note: I suggest looking into Shekhinah more for people reading this as I feel a few PH users would appreciate her style and sound.)

Ever since blowing up with Water, the general definition of Tyla's sound and what she's aiming for has given some people trouble as far as what exactly she is. With Afrobeats being the most popular style and sound from Africa, many have been quick to label Tyla an Afrobeats artist. While Tyla's certainly received influence from acts who make/have made Afrobeats such as Wizkid and Tems, her sound is more closely aligned to another genre originating in Africa. Fellow South Africans for instance are more likely to label her music as Amapiano.

To help tell the difference between the two styles, Afrobeats originated in Nigeria, with the first traces of it being found in the 1960's thanks to [musician Fela Kuti](https://youtu.be/IQBC5URoF0s?si=1plpyQ5kcp3sIVFF). This was known as simply 'Afrobeat', which became a precursor for 'Afrobeats' that would come to surge in popularity around the 2000's. Afrobeats is often used as an umbrella term to describe artists from West Africa. Artists of this particular style tend to fuse with genres from the Western World such as Hip-Hop, Funk, and R&B while executing an upbeat and high style of energy and mood.

Amapiano on the other hand is a fairly new sound that started to gain more popularity around a decade ago. The word derives from the Zulu language to mean ""the pianos"" and often uses piano melodies to shape its sound. Originating in South Africa thanks to pioneers such as [producer Kabza De Small](https://youtu.be/vaMh60blM3k?si=IyYTSfFY3phRuzPW), Amapiano's start is argued to be around the early 2010s. This style of music is generally slower while drawing from sounds such as House and Jazz for the sake of portraying a smoother, more mellow atmosphere.

# The Energy of TYLA the Album

With the release of her eponymous debut album, Tyla herself has come to describe her sound as a blend of Pop music and Amapiano (or how she's called it, Popiano) to better emphasize her origins in music from South Africa while acknowledging how she tends to appeal to pop sensibilities. Such a general mood and style shows all her self-titled debut album. Tyla's voice is generally rather light and soft, which acts as a very fitting complement to the smooth production on the vast majority of the album.

**Charisma & Vibrancy**

>They never had a pretty girl from Jo'burg  
See me now and that's what they prefer

The deluxe version of the record starts off with the upbeat anthem ""[Shake Ah](https://youtu.be/QQCTR11MSlc?si=8up0R-LIyf9EDNM-)"", which is essentially meant to be a feel-good dance song to start things off before diving into the rest of the album. It's by far the purest Amapiano track on *TYLA*. ""Shake Ah"" predominantly features Zulu language the most out of any other song on the album while using subtle shakers to help for an overall atmospheric, club-style mood. Another song to really accentuate this is ""On and On"". This song is rather minimalistic in comparison to the opener, featuring a slower beat while Tyla uses her airy timbre to revisit the mid-90s for the desire to stay at a never-ending party. Two songs that especially showcase Tyla's overall confidence are ""[Jump](https://youtu.be/n3s6lDf8Nq0?si=NZ4AAJ3m9uaH6-Xv)"" with Gunna and Skillibeng and ""On My Body"". Out of all the singles from *TYLA*, ""Jump"" is likely the track to resemble Afrobeats the most out of anything else on the record. The song features some trap-adjacent and Dancehall production, in part thanks to the featured artists. ""On My Body"" is another example of drawing from other regional sounds, providing a Latin Pop flair with Becky G accompanying Tyla on the vocals. Both tracks ooze plenty of confidence to really showcase Tyla's charisma.

**Sensuality & Infatuation**

>Let me be your muse, I'll inspire you  
In ways you won't believe  
Fifty shades and hues, tailormade for you

Tyla is generally rather flirtatious throughout this album. That much is true when looking at none other than the crown jewel for most people known as ""Water"" as well as the new single currently gaining buzz titled ""PUSH 2 START"". These two tracks are arguably the closest sound that Tyla's aiming for in terms of emphasizing her fusing both Pop and Amapiano to make Popiano. Both singles have received strong comparisons to early Beyoncé and Rihanna. [The visuals for ""PUSH 2 START""](https://youtu.be/uLK2r3sG4lE?si=iuHTSgLVbC4Q2Od8) especially help strengthen those similarities. Another song to highlight the seductive side of Tyla would be on ""[Breathe Me](https://youtu.be/TS_EMkqpoG4?si=yfj002c3o7Xi8UyC)"", with her offering herself to her partner in place of air or CPR. It's fairly calmer and not as upbeat as PUSH TO START and ""Water"" with Tyla using a more hushed timbre to sing the title of the track.

**Liberation & Resentment**

>In a maze trapped in your rule  
Many tried to cleanse me of you  
But my heart wants more

This is my favorite and arguably the most frequent mood throughout the album. Sprinkled across the record, Tyla sings about emotional conflicts such as falling into cyclical patterns from unhealthy relationships with ""BACK to YOU"", to the recognition that dedicating oneself to others often ends up leading to the detriment of one's own health on ""Priorities"". Two particular songs that especially highlight the desire to protect oneself from such conflicts are ""No. 1"" with Tems and the R&B-tinged song ""Butterflies"". Both songs are especially captivating for how they try to get this tone across. The production is full of life, with the former track speaking about putting oneself as their first and only priority for the sake of self-protection. ""Butterflies"" is a particularly interesting track as the figurative speech of someone getting butterflies from a lover is often used positively to describe being enamored with another person. However, the lyrics suggest that the relationship, although likely filled with emotional highs, is also filled with emotional toil and recklessness with the desire for more. The album finally (and ""officially"") ends off with the first song released from the record ""To Last"", with Tyla singing about a relationship that's likely ended. The closer is tinged with sadness as it speaks on the likelihood that the other person only wanted a short and fleeting relationship. The final song executing this energy after some of the last few songs implies that although the desire to break free was present, there was still a need for the relationship to feel more than just a distant memory.

# What's Next F-[Removed For Stale Topic]

In terms of overall commercial performance, the album peaked at #24 while topping the Billboard World Albums chart for 5 weeks; it also ended up charting at #8 on the 2024 Year-End World Albums. *TYLA* charted in 20+ other countries in addition.

Within a few short years on her debut, Tyla's managed to reach the ears and eyes of countless people as one of the new, notable acts from South Africa due to combining the main styles of sounds and music she grew up listening to. As she's still currently promoting this era and some of the singles off of it, it's still difficult to really determine what exactly she'll do after this era is over and how she'll take this newfound popularity to her advantage for her next project. Nevertheless, this last year or so was a shining moment to let Westerners see what Amapiano is capable of while simultaneously helping future Amapiano artists know how to reach a wider audience.

**Discussion Questions**:

1. Is there anything that hooked you in the most when listening to *TYLA*?
2. Did you know or hear of Amapiano before hearing about Tyla? Has her rise inspired you to look into more African artists or music since then?
3. What do you hope to see or hear more of from Tyla when she eventually releases her sophomore effort?
4. While Tyla's managed to get several Top 20 songs in South Africa post-Water along with two more Global 200 entries, she remains with one US Hot 100 entry at the time of writing this. Do you see her gaining more successful US songs in the future or do you view her as a flash-in-the-pan artist among Westerners?",2,1737208916.0,popheads,0,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1i4837y,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1i4837y/tifu_by_drinking_too_much_tea_and_throwing_my/,TIFU by drinking too much tea and throwing my back out ,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today, happened a few years ago. 

To set the scene, it’s my senior year of high school. It’s a Saturday, and I happen to wake up quite early, just before 8am. I get dressed, go downstairs, and go to make myself a coffee, thinking I’ll lock in and do some homework before everyone else wakes up, then go out with friends later. To my abject horror, I see we’re out of coffee. 

Okay, two options, either I go get dressed into outside clothes, trek the half-mile to the local corner shop, pay the exorbitant fee of £1.50 for an energy drink, treck back home and get changed back into home clothes, or I’ll just make do with tea. It being a cold January morning, and I being in the middle of an ultimately futile attempt to save some money, I go for the latter option. 

Thinking it’d be best to squeeze out as much of my precious caffeine from the tea as possible, I put two teabags in a mug, fill it to the brim with boiling water, and leave the teabags in until the tea’s cooled. Of course, this makes the tea very bitter and nauseating, but I refuse to be deterred. I chug it, throw out the teabags, and make a second cup of tea in the same fashion. 

Just as I make myself my third cup of horrifically bitter, overbrewed tea, and it occurs to me that if I’d have go to get the energy drink I’d be home by now and been having a much better time, I start feeling a churning in my stomach. I remember that drinking tea on an empty stomach can make you sick, and sprint to the bathroom in case I need to upchuck. 

The feeling passes, and I, being a bastion of intelligence and common sense, think it really can’t be that bad to chug that last cup of tea. I’ve already made it, and I really want the caffeine. If I feel sick, I’ll just grit my teeth and keep it down through sheer, stiff-upper-lip, British willpower. 

This works for a grand total of five minutes, and then I’m hit with a wave of nausea so powerful it makes me consider knocking my head on my desk to put myself out of my misery. I just barely make it to the toilet before my stomach expels all the caffeine I worked so hard to get down into the bowl. I don’t have time to get into a comfortable position for the job, and as I’m heaving with Olympic force I suddenly feel a sickening twinge in my spine. After I finish, it’s unmistakable: I threw up so violently I fucked up some muscle in my back. 

For weeks afterwards, my back is in constant pain. Standing hurts. Sitting hurts. Laying down hurts. The only thing that offers some semblance of relief is stretching forward, which cruelly forces me to stretch my hamstrings. I wonder if this is all an elaborate scheme my PE teacher thought up as revenge for me not trying hard enough to touch my toes in lessons. Months later, when I think I’m finally healed, sneezing in the wrong way makes my back seize up in a way that’s so surprisingly painful my vision goes black for a second. I tell my friends of my immense, unending suffering, and they say that’s just how it feels to get old. 

I shake my fist at them, and it hurts my back. 

TL;DR: Chugged three mugs of overbrewed tea on an empty stomach because caffeine, threw up so violently I pulled a muscle in my back and it took months to fully heal

Our sage Oracle is nearly 2 yrs old. Have used same beans since the start, fresh bag every 2 weeks approx. Since Xmas the tamper doesn't tamp, it's like the grinder keeps going then times out. If I click grind again it might tamp immediately or grind for a few seconds and then tamp. However it's obvious then that too much coffee is in the portafilter as nothing comes out in the brew. 
Right now I have it at grind size 20. 25g of coffee comes out of grinder yielding 41g of coffee when I brew for 29 secs. I just measured using kitchen scale for this post.
If I grind finer it will def time out. If I grind courser the water/coffee flies out! 
I have cleaned everything, for the bristles and Hoover into the grinder etc. What changes to the settings should you suggest we make? Thank you in advance!

The whole experience of enjoying life without waiting for others can be empowering.

Some benefits of going solo:

1. You might find opportunities you wouldn't have noticed if you were distracted.


2. Sunlight and fresh air do wonders for your mood and energy.


3. Being outside can help fight off feelings of anxiety or depression.


4. You’ll experience more genuine, spontaneous connections with people you meet in real life.


5. It teaches independence and self-reliance, and opens up possibilities you might have missed.



Is there anything you've experienced on your own that you wouldn't have had if you waited for someone else to join you? How do you feel about solo adventures?

1. New opportunities and connections await.


2. Sun exposure is essential for your health.


3. It helps reduce the risk of depression.


4. Nature has a calming effect on anxiety.


5. Real-life conversations with people (especially potential partners) beat swiping on dating apps.

But I also tried to go to my grandma's last weekend to stay the night and get away from her and I've been taking care of nana during the weekdays and I end up having to during the weekend too because no one else really does their to busy doing other crap and before she was bed ridden I had to watch and make sure she didn't go outside because she's fallen out there on the steps and such before and we live in kinda a woodsy area and we didn't want her going in the woods or anything so one night they let her go outside and she got all the way up the drive way and keep in the mind that drive way is really long so it took her a good at least 20 to probably 30 minutes to just get up there and let alone get down the steps and to the actual mail box so there's no way she just disappeared for a quick second which is what she claimed then another time her and her husband were doing something in their room idk what but either way they weren't paying attention to the monitor and she got out of the house with her walker so that took even longer and no one came out to check on her nothing so back to what I was saying so I had asked and she had the absolute nerve to tell me that I'm not gonna he able to go over to her house every weekend and she makes it so I have a break like no you don't because I'm still doing the absolute most around here and I always will be because I'm apparently the parent and I have to keep the house clean take care of nana and do school stuff all while keeping my dog content and finding time to take care of myself. But let me go ahead and tell you how she talked about my dad before he passed and how she still talks about him after he passed before after she'd pick me up from seeing him she'd make up random stories about him and tell me on the way home like bad stories where she's the victim she does the same about me and everyone else and when I'd tell him about them he'd tell me what actually happened and I'd ask my grandma too on both sides before my grandma on my dad's side died but then after he died like right after I got home from my step mom's house because he was supposed to come home on hospice the day after so I was just gonna stay the night so I could be there when he got home but he went to the home in the sky so I had just called my mom and asked her to come get me and take me home which she did and when we got home and I was in my room with my stuffed animal he gave me with I was 5 and had patched up countless times because if how I held it we had to preform emergency restuffings she had the nerve to ask me if I had ever had sex at the ripe age of 10 as I was in my bed trying not to cry and she at one point took my door off because of the way it shut you kinda had to slam it for it to latch and she didn't belive that even though she knew that was how it shut she still took my door off for 6 months then lied that she didn't know where the pins and stuff was to put it back on so I showed her where she laid them at and she was mad at me for that so she grounded me from my door for 2 more weeks then when I had just started school I've always been scared of like groups of people right and so I was always scared to go to school and because I was getting bullied since the first day basically i never wanted to go back but anyways she had told her mother in law to use a switch on me for it so I called her Re so Re had told me that she had bought me a pair of pants and she wanted me to try them on and had used the switch on me for a good 15 minutes and my mother had come and picked me up while I stood in the middle of the living room sobbing with my pants in my hand because yes I had been spanked and all before and smacked and all but never switched so it was quite the surprise then the other time that I vividly remember is when I told my mom I'll make her breakfast the following morning so I bad got up a bit earlier and had started her coffee once she had told me she was up and I made her something that I knew was her favorite which was oatmeal so I made it and brought it to the table and made it look nice and at that moment her husband walked in with her some takeout breakfast and she ate his breakfast and flipped her shit because I was upset that she didn't eat the oatmeal I had made her so she followed me to my room and started slapping me and I had put my hands up over my face to like keep my face from getting it which really annoyed her so she had punched me a few times all while her husband watched but that's all I'm gonna write mainly because I feel the urge to cry from going back and thinking of this stuff.

Nestled in the cosy fastness of the underground caverns, or perched on nearby mountain fissures, the walruses lay their eggs and let the rich tapestry of Nature’s lifecycle unfold - feasting peacefully on the accumulated honey in those neatly tessellated hexagonal cells, culling the weaker larvae with their fearsome tusks, carefully tending the beautifully symmetric germinating eggs in their translucent capsules, the weird shadows slowly lengthening around them as the sun sets against the distant mountains.

I got excited the other day at the idea of this, and wrote it up. Well at least some, so I’m hoping someone’s interested in the idea:




Chapter 1


“Miss Branwen?” Yang grumbled in response, still caught somewhere between sleep and wakefulness.What could they possibly want now? Could it not wait? Please let it wait. Preferably until after coffee.  


She cracked one eye open, glaring blearily toward the woman opening the curtain by her desk—or rather, her workbench these days. The sunlight flooded the room, hitting her square in the face like it was personally offended by her habit of sleeping in. Yang groaned loudly and shoved her face back into her pillow, muffling her protest. 

“Miss Branwen, it’s nearly midday!” The woman’s voice cut through her half-hearted rebellion, sharp with exasperation. 

Yang groaned again, this time with more resignation. She knew she had no argument— Vernal always shot down letting her sleep for another few minutes. The rare times she didn’t, Yang ended up sleeping a few more hours anyway. So with a defeated sigh, Yang sat up in bed, resting against the headboard. She squinted at Vernal, voice thick with sleep. “Please tell me you’ve at least got coffee. Or at least brought me breakfast.”


Vernal huffed in response, shaking her head with disbelief, though there was a small smile on her lips. “You’re as bad as your mother. How either of you functioned as kids, I’ll never know.”

“I’ll have you know, coffee is amazing! Anyone who drinks decaf has the real problem!” Yang shot back quickly, her lips curling into a cheeky smirk. Vernal simply rolled her eyes, though she was still smiling in amusement. 


Vernal grabbed a tray off the cluttered workbench— the mystery of how it all fit together, “mechanical crap,” as Vernal called it, never ceased to battle her— and brought it over. “Someone’s going to have to make a supply run soon.” Vernal informed Yang, who was practically inhaling her coffee. 

Vernal raised an eyebrow in exasperation. No matter how many times she saw the Branwens do that, it still amazed her. Yang paused for a moment after her third gulp, then glanced up at Vernal. “Fine, I’ll go on the supply run! But we both know I’m terrible at keeping track of what we need. That’s more your thing.” She flashed Vernal a lazy grin, clearly not concerned. 

“You’ll be fine! Just don’t get distracted by uh…” Vernal motioned vaguely at the cluttered workbench. Yang raised an eyebrow in mock offence, her smirk widening. “I’m not some crow!” Yang huffed, sticking out her lower lip in an exaggerated pout. “But you do like shiny things.” Vernal teased, her voice laced with amusement. 


“Fine, fine! You’ve got me there.” She threw up her hand in surrender, but her smile never faltered. “I swear on my name that I won’t get anything shiny!” Yang placed her hand on her chest, as if that would help convince Vernal. 


Vernal rolled her eyes, but couldn’t hide the small smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “I might just hold you to that,” She replied dryly, though a flicker of amusement danced in her eyes. Yang chuckled, giving her a playful wink. “Trust me, I’m practically allergic to the stuff now!” 


Vernal shook her head in amusement, chuckling lightly. “I’ll text you a list,” She said as she stood up. Yang tried to finish her breakfast quickly, but her attention was already shifting to Vernal as she grabbed something off the workbench.

“Working on it again?” Vernal asked, her tone losing its earlier amusement, now soft but edged with concern. Yang chewed quickly, then set the remains of her toast down, the lightheartedness leaving her expression as she turned her attention fully to Vernal. “Yeah, just tinkering with it a little. It’s been a little slow recently.” 


Vernal didn’t respond immediately. She examined the piece in her hands, as if weighing Yang’s words. “Is that why you gave it a paint job?” She tried to sound amused, but she couldn’t hide the seriousness in her tone. Not that she would want to. Yang could tell there was more to the question, but she didn’t feel like talking about it just yet. Maybe after a few more coffees, or a few beers. 


Yang shrugged, and picked up the mug of coffee. “You know how it is. You get bored one day and suddenly you’re painting your house in a new colour. At least that’s what normal people do right?” 


Vernal turned toward Yang, and raised an eyebrow. She didn’t push it, though— she’d long ago learned that Yang tinkered when she got stressed, or when she was trying to avoid something… or someone. Instead, she brought over the contraption and set it down by Yang’s feet. “Need help putting it on?” She asked, her voice soft, accompanied by a kind smile.


Yang looked down at the metallic arm, now a mix of yellow and black. Her fingers brushed against the cold metal, and for a moment, it felt like getting it for the first time— heavy, alien, yet filled with a stubborn kind of hope she hadn’t realised she’d clung to back then. She raised her actual hand to the stub on her left side, the familiar pain from years ago surfacing. 

Her mother’s voice echoed in her mind, ringing with concern, and the memory of blood and sweat lingered in the air. How many years has it been now? Seven? Eight? Long enough that people have come to know her for it, and stop staring when Yang looked their way. 



She remembered the day clearly, her mother had dragged her out of bed, telling her— demanding Yang to stop moping about for one damned minute. Yang groaned and whined, trying every excuse that she could think of. But when she inevitably followed her mother into the kitchen, there it was— on the kitchen table, wrapped in some neat packaging that Raven would never have bothered with. 

Yang asked Vernal about it later, but she adamantly denied her role in it. Vernal shrugged it, claiming she didn’t even know about it. Yang hadn’t believed her then, and she didn’t believe her now. 



It took weeks of training to get used to the arm. The repair instructions left by the creator—a doctor from Atlas, Yang later found out—were written in clinical terms that might as well have been gibberish. But that didn’t stop Yang from modifying it every so often. Figuring it out gave her something to focus on, something to fight for— a way to feel like herself again, even if she wasn’t quite the same.



“Yang?” Vernal’s voice cut through her thoughts, soft but insistent, grounding her in the present. Yang blinked up at her, startled out of the storm of memories. She tried to force a warm smile, but it wavered at the edges, betraying her. 

“I should probably take a shower first, I reek of oil and sweat.” Yang forced a laugh, brushing her fingers through her messy hair. The heaviness of the memories remained, but a quick shower— and the hour it would take to dry her hair— would help shake it off.


“Reek is putting it lightly,” Vernal said with a mock gag, dramatically holding her nose. “Honestly, it’s a miracle I’m still standing here!”

Yang rolled her eyes, the corners of her lips tugging into a small, genuine smile. “Don’t be so dramatic, Vernal. You’ve smelled worse.”

1i47ske,https://www.reddit.com/r/henna/comments/1i47ske/newbie_and_s/,Newbie and ?s,"I have virgin, fine, slightly wavy, chestnut brown hair which lightens in the sun. I like how it's naturally multidimensional, but I'm very fair, and it usually looks very desaturated, and especially in the winter it looks very dull. I wore a reddish brown wig once for a performance (it was just a super cheap stage wig) and got a lot of compliments on how the color actually looked really great on me. The richer color warmed me up. I played around in facetune and when I try the copper hair color on me, I see what they mean.

I've been thinking how to change my hair color to have that sort of dark red warm tint, largely on my natural highlights. Without damaging my fine hair and without the expense of regular salon coloring, and am considering henna.

I've been reading this sub about how to do it, and found this post, which largely matches my natural color and the desired result is a lot like that fake wig I wore:

There's a helpful comment there about doing cassia+amla+henna in a 7:2:1 ratio. I think it would be good to start there? And then if I think it isn't red enough I can do it again in a few weeks with a larger ratio of henna?

I'm looking for how to buy those, I'm in continental Europe, and it's most cost effective to get 1kg bags of each. Obviously with the suggested ratio I need a lot of cassia, but about how much total amount of powder should I use for the first try for shoulder length hair?

I'm thinking about mixing in coffee, simply because I have some coffee in my cupboard I don't drink anymore. But I saw a comment online that amla should not be put in coffee? Is that right? Is it just because they're both acidic? Or would it ruin the amla?

**Sean woke up from his coma after four months with an insatiable hunger for food. The first thing out of his mouth to the nurse was “french fries”. He was forty-two years old and he was awake. It was a car collision that involved him and another fellow. He had run a red light during the wee hours of the night on a busy city street, crashing into the other man on the passenger side, not harming him. The unfortunate part was that he was left paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his natural life. He had been awake for four days by the time he had gotten any visits while in the hospital.**

**He was sitting up eating a bowl of ice cream and looking down at his legs.**

**“So, for now, you’re going to be staying at an assisted living home. Because the accident was ruled as your fault, your insurance isn’t compensating for the accident. You will be relying on the government disability act until or if you even can go back to work. Get it?”**

**“I get it. I’m a bum now until I show them I can still handle work requirements. Simply put, I’m fucked. I can’t operate the machinery at the plant anymore, so I’ll be waiting for a monthly payoff of peanuts for the rest of my shitty life. I get it, Mark. Who sent you anyway?”**

**“John did because he knows you’re my brother-in-law so he figured…”**

**“He figured he could pass the job of telling me to you.** 

**“I guess.”**

**“Well, it’s done then. Thanks for coming by.”**

**“No problem. The doctor said that you’ll be okay to leave after they’ve rendered you capable.”**

**“Cool. I hate this hospital. The only thing that’s good about this place is the desserts. The nurses here are dogs. Have you seen them? They're a bunch of mutts.”**

**“Sean, leave it to you to say something vulgar like that.”**

**“Hey, nothing's wrong with my libido, brother.”**

**“So, do you need anything else?”**

**“Ya, get me some Mars bars from the Canteen, will ya?”**

**“Done deal. Then I have to leave. Busy weekend for us, you know how it is.”**

**“No, I don’t but I am sympathetic to you. Spend time with my sister and be good to her, eh?”**

**“Always, Sean.”**

**When Sean was finally alone, he had time to contemplate just what had occurred. All he could remember about the accident was leaving the bar. He had been drinking at Al’s all evening hitting on a woman who frequented there often but would never give in to his advances. Lee was her name and she always played hard to get with Sean. On the evenings that they would run into each other, she would ask him to play a game of pool with her, always accepting the drink he would offer to buy. Vodka and seven on ice was her drink and he never got it wrong. He would let her win every game, being as pleasant as he could in his efforts to lay her. She was his type and he just loved the way she laughed. But she was a player and the method to her madness was to get free drinks from the bachelors. It worked quite well for her when she stuck to the dive bars around town.**

**On those nights, including the night of the crash, he would leave the bar alone. And that is all he remembered about that night, drinking and playing pool with Lee, getting cut off for the night by the bartender, and getting in his car to drive home. The accident itself failed to be conscious in his mind.**

**Sean kept trying to jog his memory of that night but nothing ever stood out as a clear memory. It all fell into place as just another night at the bar in his mind and nothing more.**

**But he knew that this wasn’t the case as he tried to move his legs at all. The injuries that he took away from the accident were a broken left wrist, a broken neck, some minor cuts and bruises, and a chipped tooth. When he spoke to the doctor, he said that they were hoping in time that he may regain some of the feelings in his legs but he would never walk again. Every time he thought about this he got depressed, staying with him the whole time he was in the hospital.**

**On discharge day, he was so revved up to get going, that he couldn’t keep his hands still. He would use the phone, then flick the channels on the television, or scribble notes on paper that were relatively meaningless.**

**Anything to keep him occupied.**

**“Mr. Vader, are you ready to leave? Have they given you your belongings yet?”**

**“I think so. Yes. I am geeked to get out of here, that’s for sure”**

**“Good. The chair is yours until you get your real chair. I’ll wheel you downstairs where there will be a cab coming for you soon. All set?”**

**“I guess,” Sean said listlessly.**

**The cab was already waiting there by the time they got to the entrance. He was helped in and quickly dropped off at the Helping Hands Assisted Living Institution on the other side of the city. The occupational nurse at the hospital showed Sean how to leverage his weight and get himself in and out of the chair to do practical duties. He was still very new to it, so it took him time to get from one position to the next.**

**He sat in front of the home taking it in that he was dependent on others from now on to get around and perform certain tasks. Sean wasn’t the type to rely on people, so it was very difficult for him to accept this fate. He took a mental image of the building and pushed his way through the door and to the front desk.**

**Right away, he was greeted by a nurse in a loose-fitting uniform, who introduced herself as Patricia. They exchanged greetings, and he was shown to his room. He would remember her name by relating it to her toothy smile. He liked her right away and told himself to ask her if he ever needed anything.**

**He sat in the wheelchair, staring around the room at his shared situation. The room consisted of two beds, two dressers, two end tables, and a television mounted on the wall. His bed was located beside the window labeled on the headboard as “205B. 205A was empty it seemed so for the time being he had the room to himself. All in all the room was pleasant with two very large paintings of scenery and wall-to-wall carpeting in burgundy to add to the decor.** 

**Sean wheeled around the room, taking it all in, noticing the central air and ensuite bathroom. About five minutes into this the loudspeaker from the hall went off with a voice from administration.**

**“To all residents… dinner will be served at four-thirty pm. Please feel free to utilize our coffee and tea service. Thanks.”**

**Sean checked his watch which said four-twelve pm. That gave him time to wheel himself to the elevator and discover the dining room on the first floor. He could feel his arms burning from the weight as he approached the elevator. Just as he was arriving at the doors, they opened. He saw it was Patricia again but he froze in shock when she exited the doors. Her face was a mess of decay and rot, her cheeks hanging and her teeth exposed. One of her eyes was missing and she had no tongue. She tried to say something to him but it only came out as a garbled retching at him. He yelped and pushed himself back in terror. She walked right by him and turned her face away. For a moment he just sat there, and when he turned himself around to look once again, she was normal. Her face wasn’t grotesque anymore. She smiled at him with a fresh face, eyes bright and cheery. He forced a small back and got himself on the elevator, completely indifferent to what had just happened.**

**He was breathing heavily as the elevator took him from the second floor to the first, unable to process what he had just seen.**

**“You’re hallucinating now too buddy. Get a grip. It’s probably one of my medications that’s doing this to me.”**

**Once out of the noisy elevator, he entered the large cafeteria-style area where people were lined up to two servers that doled out food at the back of the room. Sean took his place at the back of the line and waited his turn. There were about fourteen people ahead of him and he figured it would be awhile before he set down to eat. He fixed his gaze on everyone already seated. There were all different types of characters eating their meals at the tables. He was eager to see what kind of food they served at the establishment he was now a part of.**

**He started to think about Patricia and how her face had changed. He just couldn’t figure out how his mind could trick him like that. When it was his turn to pick out his food he was impressed. He had choices of two different dishes and he picked the pasta and salad for himself, along with a glass of milk and coffee. They even had a fruit cup for dessert but he passed it by. He sat down at a table where there was only one other person seated. It was a man in his forties who looked rather thin and sinewy in appearance. He had a five o’clock shadow and no front teeth to chew with. Every time he closed his jaw to chew it looked as though half of his face disappeared. Sean almost giggled at the sight of this but looked down at his place to distract himself.**

**He began to eat his pasta with a traditional fork and spoon, circling the pasta around until he had a full bite ready when someone yelled out loud something he couldn’t quite understand. He looked up from his plate but could see no one in distress. Just then, two attendants raced over to a woman at another table to the left of him who seemed to be choking. It was the man sitting next to her that had yelled out for help.**

 **When Sean looked back at his plate, he jumped back in his seat, horrified. On his plate, instead of spaghetti, was a pile of pinkish-purple worms, wriggling and sliding about. He yelped out loud and the whole room stopped and stared at him. He tried to stand up, forgetting his disability, only causing him to ram his back more into the seat of the wheelchair. The room was silent for a few seconds before he looked back down at the plate. When he did, it was only spaghetti again. Sean was perplexed.**

**“My spaghetti just turned into worms on my plate! And now it's spaghetti again! I swear it was…” his voice trailing away the more ridiculous he sounded as he went on.**

**He looked over at the man who looked at Sean as though he were crazy and said, “Sorry. My bad. I made a mistake, that's all.”**

**Slowly the room returned to the clanging of utensils and dishware and small talk. Sean was relieved to have the attention pulled away from him then. But the man still stared at him intently, making Sean feel like an oddball. Sean suddenly lost his appetite.**

**“Funny how things can happen the way they do, wouldn’t you say?”**

**“I’d say.”**

**“You’re new here. My name’s Albert. Yours?**

**“Sean.”**

**“Nice to meet you, Sean. How’d you end up in the chair?”**

**“Car accident.”**

**“Oh. I see. Was the other guy hurt?”**

**“No. Just me.”**

**“Hmmm. Are you gonna eat your food?”**

**“No. My stomach’s a little nervous. Go ahead.”**

**“Thanks.”**

**Immediately, Albert grabbed Sean’s plate and pushed the contents with his fork onto his plate. He proceeded to shovel in the food in large bites, grossing Sean out even more. He started to talk through his food and that was when Sean found his time to exit. He was wheeling away regardless of what anyone thought when he heard someone say behind him, “You can run but it will always be there lurking inside of you somewhere, fella.”**

**Sean jerked his head to the left and right and saw no one. Then he circled and saw a tiny lady with white hair in a bun staring right at him. She was smiling but it was a sad smile. When they exchanged glances she nodded her head to signify it was her that said it. He looked at her with wonder in his eyes when she turned and walked away down another hall. Sean was left there wondering what the hell she meant by that. He sat there for a moment, less amused and more bothered, before he left the dining hall. He returned to his room to relieve himself, unpack his belongings, and then sleep for the night.**

**But things took a turn when he came across a twenty-sixer of vodka that his brother-in-law must have snuck in there on his visit. He immediately downed three gulps from it, relieved by its effect on him. He was an alcoholic and he knew it. If he was going to let other people he knew in on his secret was another story. He decided that from now on only he would know about how much he drank and when.**

**Taking a fourth gulp, he began to think about what a weird day it had turned out to be his first day at the home. He was seeing and hearing things that were peculiar on a low note and he couldn’t figure out what would have caused those hallucinations. He chalked it up to stress and nothing more after pondering it most of the evening before going to bed.** 

**The bed wasn’t super comfortable but it would do for him. As he was falling asleep, he thought about his future and what it was supposed to be like living without the use of his legs. He told himself that he wouldn’t stay depressed and that he would keep fighting no matter what. Things were the way they were and he had to accept this no matter how shitty it seemed to him. He drifted off finally, drunk and exhausted.**

	**Morning came too soon for Sean, waking him with the gleam of the sun on his face. His mouth felt like cotton balls and he had to pee badly. He lifted himself to his chair like they showed him and adjusted his legs. His hangover was screaming in his head and he was shaking a bit as he flushed the toilet. In order to see his reflection in the mirror he had to sit back near the toilet, and he was alarmed at what he saw there. His face was gaunt and he was greying on the sides prematurely.**

	**“I guess I wasn’t paying very much attention to my looks before the accident. Either I was lying to myself, or the accident did this to me.”**

**He looked from side to side at himself, hoping to catch a good image but there was none. He looked like shit and he knew it.**

	**Sean began the day with some good self-talk and he thought it was actually working when the loudspeaker came on again for breakfast.**

	**He quickly washed his face, brushed, and got dressed to go down when there was a knock at the door. He wheeled over and opened it, but there was no one standing there. He looked down the hall both ways and it was empty. He shrugged his shoulders and went to grab his room key when someone else was at the door. Only this time it was a thunderous banging that he heard.**

**“Just a minute,” he called, racing to the door once again to find again, no one there,**

**“Very funny. What the fuck do you want?”**

**Again, no one was in the hall.**

**“Whatever.”**

**Sean tried to put it all out of his mind and raced to the elevator. He pushed the down button, noticing that calluses were beginning on his hands from the intense use of them with the wheelchair. He kept turning his head as far as he could see behind him, not liking the limitations he had as a disabled. He got himself on the elevator and had lunch without saying a word, paying his mind to everything around him. His breakfast went uneventful.**

**After eating, he decided that he would have a drink with himself just because he could. He dismissed the fact that it wasn't even eleven o’clock yet, rationalizing it and believing that he was under stress and deserved it. It was something he often did to accept his behaviors.**

**He poured himself a strong drink, using the paper cups from the bathroom. He drank it down in two gulps, disliking the taste, but loving its effects.**

**By noon, he finished the bottle and was feeling pretty buzzed from the vodka. He told himself he was going to have to make a trip to the liquor store soon. How he was going to do this he didn’t know yet. He had skipped lunch and his stomach burned pretty bad by one o’clock.** 

**He decided he was going to have a shower, located right next door to where his room was. He got his towels and soap together and put them on his lap to check if it was vacant, and when he saw that it was, he dashed in. The shower was clean, and there was a shower chair for him to utilize, so he took advantage of it. The hot shower felt good on his skin. He let the water fall onto him, trying to drain away the stress of what had happened to him. He was forever changed and he had to face it.**

**As he returned to his room, his mind was flooded with the idea of getting more alcohol. He didn’t know anyone there yet to ask them to pick it up for him and he didn’t want others to know he drank anyhow, so he came up with the idea that he would take a taxi and have the driver purchase it for him. It was really his only alternative in his situation.**

**So, he took his phone with him and waited out front after calling for the cab. It was a nice day and he didn’t need a jacket but he wore it anyway so he could disguise the bottle in it.**

**The cab came fast and agreed to go in for him, receiving a five-dollar tip for his efforts. Sean was having a nice afternoon, or so he thought.**

**When he got back to his room there was another knock at the door. This time, there was someone there.**

**“Hello. Remember me? I’m the guy who sat with you yesterday at dinner. Ring a bell?”**

**“Ya, I remember you. What’s up?”**

**I was wanting to ask you if you would like to come over to my room for coffee?”**

**“I was just about to lay down, maybe another…”**

**“Listen, I don’t have many friends and I am sure you want to find out some things about this place. What d’ya say?”**

**“Thanks but…”**

**“Then, can I come in for a drink? I can see your whiskey bottle poking out of your vest, Sean.”**

**“You’re serious?”**

**“Just one drink and I’ll go.”**

**“All right then, I guess.”**

**Sean opened the door just enough to let the man slip into the room, quietly. He immediately took off his jacket and sat on the empty bed that said 205A on the headboard. Sean sat directly across from him on his own bed.**

**“Thank you kindly, I really appreciate your hospitality.”**

**“It’s alright,” returned.**

**“This is your second time here, am I right?”**

**“Yes, and how did you know my name? I never told you who I was.”**

**“Oh, information travels fast around here. Besides, I’m good at guessing names. Ya believe me?”**

**“I guess. It’s Albert, right?”**

**“Albert it is. Now for that drink?”**

**“You don’t hesitate do you,” Sean said cynically.**

**“I try to stay in the moment.”**

**Sean poured two drinks into paper cups and handed him one.** 

**“There you go. So, what interesting things do you know about this place,” he asked.**

**“Oh, only the important things. Do you have any questions for me?”**

**“Not really. This place seems to be pretty straightforward if you ask me.”**

**“I wouldn’t say that about this place. It had its secrets, you know.”**

**“What kind of secrets?”**

**“Well, I’ll explain a bit about the ways things happen around here,” he said, sipping his drink and flinching. “I’ll begin with the people. Everyone here is paying a price for things they have done in the past. Let’s say that it isn’t much more than a central station where people are sent to that have done things. There are no bars on the windows or locks on the doors… and you can come and go as you please, but… it’s a kind of existential hell here, you see. You can leave any time you want, but where are you really gonna go? And there are other things going on inside these walls. Supernatural things. They are to make you see the wrongs of your ways, in so many words. There are lessons to be learned here.”**

**“What are you saying? That this place has ghosts or something?”**

**“Not exactly. You’ll see in no time.”**

**“I’ve already experienced a few weird things. Am I a target or something?”**

**“Everyone here is targeted. We all have things to learn before we can leave here.”**

**“And what if you don’t learn anything?”**

**“Then you don’t leave.”**

**“What you’re saying is interesting and all, but I think you’re talking out your ass. Apologies.”**

**“None needed, but I think you should mind what's going on around here. It’s in your best interests.”**

**Albert downed the last of his drink and stood up to leave.**

**“Thanks for your words, but I’ll be fine.”**

**“I hope so. Keep your eyes and ears peeled if you know what’s good for ya.”**

**“I will, and thank you.”**

**“See you on the flip side, friend,” Albert stated, leaving the room just as silently as he entered.**

**Sean just sat there, ingesting what the man had just spoken. He thought the man was off-kilter with the jargon he told to him. Just then, the loudspeaker came on and stated, ”We apologize to say that the elevator will be out of use until tomorrow morning. Your meals will be dropped off at your room door at regularly scheduled times. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you.”**

**“Just perfect,” Sean exclaimed to himself. “I didn’t want to leave the room anyhow.”**

**He went to the bathroom to pee and this time he avoided looking at himself in the mirror. He knew he didn’t look good and his day was already scrambled enough.**

**Sean flushed the toilet and wheeled back to the room where he poured another drink, gulping it empty in one gulp. He put the paper cup back on the end table and tilted his head back, closing his eyes to think. When he opened them the room had changed.**

**The walls were wet and the color of blood, shiny. The room was empty of all furniture as well, with just him in his chair. He looked at the door that was also red and yelled out, “What the fuck is going on?!”**

**Just then, the walls began to pulsate in and out as if they were breathing, The noise of wood creaking in his ears. He stayed silent after that, watching and listening to the walls crying out, only closing his eyes in absolute horror. The creaking sound bellowed loud and fierce, creating a scrunched look on his face.**

**When he opened his eyes, which seemed like an eternity, everything was back to normal. The beds and walls were the same, and there was only the sound of the toilet’s running water. He breathed a sigh of relief, wiping the sweat from his upper lip.**

**“What the fuck is wrong with me,” he whispered to himself. “I must be going crazy or something. Holy fuck. What** ***is*** **this place?”**

**He checked his watch and it said four-thirty. They would be coming around with his dinner soon, and if he wanted another bottle he would have to get it after they served him. He decided to rest for a bit on his bed, remembering the luxury of driving his car to work and to the bar every day. A single tear soaked his pillow while he was feeling sorry for himself. Just as he was about to drift off, someone knocked at the door with three sharp bangs.**

**He got out of bed as fast as he could and sped for the door in his wheelchair, he was so hungry. When he answered it, there was a figure before him that he took to be male because of the uniform, but he had no face. All that was there was an oval head with short dark hair. Where the eyes, nose, and mouth should have been, it was only smooth skin.**

**“Rrrhmmmrrffffssstt,” it said.**

**“Aaahhhh,” Sean yelled in return. Rrr Hmmm Rrfff Mmmnnnmmnnn.”**

**Sean slammed the door so hard, that his baseball hat that was hooked on the inside came off and fell to the carpet. Then the knocking came again, even harder this time. Sean was reluctant to answer the door, but in his panic, he knew he had to. Someone or something was on the other side of that door but that was his only way in and out.**

**He turned the knob slowly and pulled the door back a few inches and peeked through the crack.**

	**“Mr. Limly, I have your dinner here. If you don’t want it, all you have to do is tell me.”**

**Sean opened the door ever so slowly to meet the man with his dinner. This time he had a normal face with all his features. He looked and sounded to be of Spadescentecent.**

**“I’ll just take it then.”**

**“It’s pasta with a small salad and apple pie. And, a juice box. It’s all there.”**

**“Thank you so kindly,” Sean spoke quietly. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what’s come over me.”problemroble, Mr. Limly. We all have our days.”**

**Sean closed the door softly and put his meal on a tray on the end table as well. He knew he had to eat so he forced the pasta down, wondering what could be wrong with him. As he was finishing, he came to the conclusion that it was the Dt’s that he was experiencing and nothing more. A simple explanation for a complex situation.**

**After his meal, he decided to call another cab to buy more whiskey. The trip to the liquor store unfolded without problem and he was once again, back in his room, ready to crack the bottle.**

**He got himself a drink and gulped it down straight away, pouring another to ease the tension he felt in the small room. He gulped the second one grimacing at its bitter strength. He breathed out the heat from the whiskey through his mouth, pouring a third,  settling down a bit.**

**“I’m going fucking nuts and I’ve only been here three days damned it! What is** ***wrong*** **with me?!”**

**“I’ll tell you what’s wrong with you. You’re having hallucinations, Sean. The kind of hallucinations that try to tell you something. Get it?”**

**He looked over to the left at the floor where the voice was coming from and only saw the central air vent. That wasn’t what was talking to him, was it?**

**“I am here to show you things about yourself, Sean. You are here to face what you have done wrong, Do you know what you have done wrong?”**

**“I am not talking to the heater vent. Who’s doing this to me? Are you the people next door trying to make me think I’m crazy?! I bet you are. Well, I’m not falling for it for one second, you hear me? It's not not your neighbor, Sean. It’s more than that and you need to listen carefully to what I have to say.”**

**“I don’t have to listen to shit.”**

**“Yes, you do, and you will.”**

**“Says who? And you can’t stop me from saying what I have to say. I mean, who’s going to believe that there are voices coming from the vent, Sean? Who would believe you?”**

**“I don’t care. I’ll block you out.”**

**“How?”**

**“I’ll… put on some music really loud.”**

**“You’ll still hear me.”**

**“Will I, now?”**

**Sean grabbed for his phone and found a playlist of downloaded country songs and hit the play button. Hank William Jr. began to bellow from the cell phone, raspy from having it on full blast. He was singing about country boys surviving… Sean listened for the voice.**

**“I’m still here.”**

**Sean heard the manly voice as clear as a bell in his head.**

**“Damn. What do you want from me?!”**

**“I want to tell you something.”**

**“There is nothing for me to learn about the accident. It’s done and so am I. I have no life now.”**

**“I am not talking about your current situation, Sean. What were you doing five winters ago, can you remember?”**

**“I can’t even remember two years ago. I was probably working. So what?”**

**“So, five winters ago you did something. Something really bad. Do you recall what it is?”**

**“I am not a bad person. I think you have someone else.”**

**“ No, I'm sure I have the right man. Sean, you are a murderer.”**

**“I have never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I am a nonviolent person. I don’t even like confrontation.”**

**“I can see that, but you like to drink, don’t you?”**

**There was another knock at the door. Sean answered it, hoping that they could explain the voice from the vent. He felt hysterically hopeful.**

**“Mr. Limly, could you please keep your music down a bit? Other people are complaining that it’s too loud. You wouldn’t mind, would you?”**

**“No problem, but could you come in for a minute? I want you to take a look at something.”**

**“Sure. No problem, but it has to be quick. I am a busy lady.”**

**“What’s your name?”** 

**“Veronica, but everyone calls me Vicky”**

**Listen, Vicky, come over here for a second. I want you to just listen to this vent. It’s been saying things to me and I want you to hear it for yourself. I know it sounds crazy, but…”**

**“You’re probably just hearing people from other rooms talking. But, I’ll humor you,” she said smiling. She was a young and pretty twenty-three year-old Chinese woman who really did not have the time for him but obliged Sean.**

**Vicky walked over to the vent and noticed the open bottle on the nightstand, and quickly made her judgment before she could listen to anything.**

**“Mr. Limly, have you been drinking?. You know we have a policy here that there should be no intoxicated behaviors going on…”**

**“I am not drunk. Just listen now.”**

**“She can’t hear me like you do, Sean,” the voice spoke.**

**“There! You see?! You heard it, right?”**

**“No, I can't hear anything. I think you may just need some more rest. The accident left you…”**

**“*****Fuck*** **the accident. Are you telling me you didn’t hear that?”**

**“I am telling you I can’t hear anything come from the vent. Now…”**

**“Well, fuck you then! You’re just lying to me to make me think I’m crazy. Well, I’m not!”**

**“Mr. Limly…**

**“Just get out!”**

**“This is not a game.”**

**“I am speaking to you in this manner because you** ***are*** **insane, Sean. Nothing is going to be the same from now on. I guess I should tell you why you went insane, shouldn’t I now?”**

**“Yes! But I am not crazy,”**

**“Oh yes you are. Or at least you will be. This is only the beginning. Five winters ago, you were driving home drunk and you hit someone. You hit them with your car while you were drunk, and killed them. It was a woman on her way home from work, walking in the snow, crossing on a side street, and you hit her. Hard enough to kill her Sean. And when you saw what you did, you took off. Do you remember any of this?”**

**“I didn’t hit ANYONE!”**

**“You most surely did.”**

**Sean began to cry then. He sobbed loudly, knowing deep in his core that it could have been possible. He had driven home so many times in a blackout that it could be possible that he hit someone and just wasn’t aware of it.**

**“Did I hit someone,” he asked softly.**

**“Yes, you did. Why do you think you are paralyzed, Sean? Being in that chair is the karma you are receiving from the murder you committed. It was your fate and now you must live with this.”**

**“Who knows about this?”**

**“Just you and us.”**

**“Who are you?”**

**“It is none of your business who we are, Sean. That’s not the point. What you have done you are paying for with your body and your sanity.”**

**“But I didn’t do it on purpose,” Sean whined.**

**“You must still pay the price.”**

**“What’s going to happen to me?”**

**“Where you are, you will experience things fitting to what you have done. We will be back in a very short time. For now, we will simply let you feel the weight of what you have done.”**

**Sean collapsed onto the floor next to the grate, fingering the steel while his nose ran snot onto the carpet.**

**“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry,” he whined so loud that there was another knock at the door not long after.**

**Sean didn’t answer this time and the attendant waited minutes until finally entering the room with a main key. What Vicky saw was startling.**

**She found the new resident sprawled on the floor, lying in his own urine, drooling all over himself. His hair was completely white as he stared up at the ceiling repeating to himself, “I’m sorry,,, I’m sorry…”**

**She left the room and went to the nurse’s station, where Nurse Angela was working as head nurse for the shift. Right away Vicky said sarcastically, “We got another one feeling sorry for himself. Why do they always send us the ones who are still in the realization stage? Why can’t they ship us the ones who are at a level of repentance that’s more respectful? We always get the sloppy ones who are still practicing their sins… I need a vacation.”**

**“I agree,” Vicly returned. “But, we have a job to do here. Prepare them for either ascension or condemnation. Where do you think this one’s  going?”**

It comes with a 100g calibration weight, but for the life of me I can't work out how to get into calibration mode - or even if there is one. When I place the 100g weight on the scale, it registers 100.2...after a short while it will (sometimes) seemingly auto-calibrate to 100g exactly. But if I remove the weight and replace it it shows 100.2g once again. So clearly not calibrated. 

Does anyone have this scale? Is there a way to enter calibration mode? I assumed that as it arrives with a calibration weight, then it could be calibrated.

1i47n6q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i47n6q,Brown Butter Pecan Coffee Ice Cream (Keto obv),"Ingredients

Brown Butter Pecan Base
	•	1.5 tbsp (21g) salted butter
	•	2 tbsp (12g) pecans, roughly chopped

Ice Cream Base
	•	1 cup (240ml) heavy cream
	•	1/4 cup (60g) mascarpone cheese
	•	2 tbsp (30ml) additional heavy cream (to thin mascarpone)
	•	75g granulated allulose
	•	1 serving (39g) Premier Protein Vanilla Protein Powder
	•	1 tsp caramel emulsion
	•	1/2 tsp Waka Butterscotch Vanilla Instant Coffee Powder (adjust for subtle flavor)
	•	1/8 tsp fine sea salt

Instructions

Step 1: Make the Brown Butter Pecan Base
	1.	Heat a skillet over medium heat and melt the butter until golden brown and nutty in aroma (3-4 minutes).
	2.	Add the chopped pecans to the browned butter and toast for 1-2 minutes to release their flavor into the butter.
	3.	Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve, reserving the browned butter and discarding the pecans or using them as garnish. Let the browned butter cool slightly.

Step 2: Heat the Ice Cream Base
	1.	In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the heavy cream, mascarpone, and granulated allulose. Whisk continuously until the mascarpone is melted and the mixture is smooth (do not boil).
	2.	Remove from heat and whisk in the browned butter, Premier Protein powder, caramel emulsion, coffee powder, and fine sea salt until fully dissolved. Adjust sweetness or flavor to taste.

Step 3: Cool and Freeze the Base
	1.	Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then pour it into a Ninja Creami pint container.
	2.	Secure the lid and freeze for at least 24 hours in a level position.

Step 4: Process in the Ninja Creami
	1.	Install the frozen pint into the Ninja Creami and select the “Ice Cream” setting.
	2.	If the ice cream is crumbly, use the “Re-spin” function until the texture becomes creamy.

Tips for Sweetness and Flavor
	•	Increasing the allulose ensures the sweetness is not lost during freezing.
	•	The caramel emulsion and browned butter create a deep, rich flavor that balances the sweetness.

Using the Hydroforming tamper allowed me to tamp the coffee without misplacing or missleveling & then see if the channellling happens differently. Yet the channeling happens In the same spot -> Closer to the edge towards the lever -> puck looks slanted.

  
I am using water dispersing disks on top of the puck.

She is going to be four years old in April. She is spayed. She has always been the best behaved cat. She is strictly indoors, and is allowed to go onto my back screened in patio and watch the birds and animals that roam around. In the past she would stay out there all the time and lounge on the chairs and always beg to go out when the door was closed. 

Over the past couple of months she will not leave me alone when I am sitting on the couch in the living room. She will meow constantly and try to get my attention. I’ll bring her up on the couch but she’ll just jump down and resume her meowing. All she does is meow and is becoming unbelievably clingy and attention seeking. She’ll sit on the ground next to my couch and do nothing but meow and whine. Even as I type this she is doing it now.

She has toys, food, water, large windows, her patio, all of which kept her occupied in the past. I’m doing my best to ignore her but she won’t stop. It happens all day as long as I am on my couch. I can’t relax after work because she meows at me. I can’t sip my coffee and wake up in the morning because she meows at me.

Again, this never was a problem until about a month or two ago. I’m at my wits end. I love her and would never rehome her for this but I admit it is getting on my last nerve. I can’t stand the constant meowing anymore. 

What could be causing this? Why did she go from a cat who would beg to be outside and stare at the wildlife and be occupied for hours to now just sitting by my couch and meowing and whining non stop? I’m desperate.",3,1737206805.0,CATHELP,4,1.0,False

I bought my Kitchenaid Nespresso machine used from Facebook Marketplace about two years ago, from a woman who had owned it for about three years. It had worked absolutely perfectly up until about six months ago. 
I went to brew my usual cup one morning (I use the largest cup size setting because I have trash taste in coffee and prefer it a bit weaker), and noticed that the size of the cup it brewed was less than the smallest brew option. It still had a crema on top, but very little liquid. I brewed another cup and it came out just fine.  

That started to happen about every second or third day, not super consistent but enough to annoy me (and waste many pods). Then I noticed sometimes the coffee would brew in the right size, but it would be extremely watery. Then one random time, I ran it without a pod in it (because I noticed sometimes that would help me avoid getting a wasted shot, it seemed the first run of the morning was always the worst), and water leaked ALL OVER MY FLOOR. Still not at all sure how that happened. 

Very early on in this process, I descaled it thoroughly, but that did not seem to help at all. 

I love this machine so so very much. I really would love to repair it instead of replace it if possible. Does anyone on here have any clue what could be causing this problem? I am open to a little DIY. I do not know if contacting Nespresso would help as I’m soooo far out of any kind of warranty. Thank you so much in advance!!🫶🏻",0,1737206659.0,nespresso,0,0.5,False

So the flavour of this shot although it looks great was very bitter, I'm on my flavour journey now so trying to improve my shots. 

The Shot: 
- 21g Coffee
- 21g Basket
- 10 bar internal pressure (not portafilter)
- 32 seconds
- 42g Yield

The Coffee: 
- Dark Arts Roaster
- 1500m
- Reyes Honduras
- creamy, mellow, acidity, mandarin
- Date Roasted: 14/01/25

The Process: 
- Weigh Coffee
- Grind coffee
- WDT Coffee
- Manual Tamp

- The Puck
- No signs of channeling

1i479yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1i479yq/new_delonghi_bitter/,New Delonghi Bitter,"So, my wife bought me a Breville a few years ago.  We love it, and have had zero issues with it.  I had a buddy try it, and he decided he wanted one too, so he jumped on the bandwagon and bought a Delonhi.  I asked him a few months later how he was enjoying his coffee, and he said that he doesn't like it AT ALL.  Said that it tasted bitter.  So he brought it over and sure enough, there is a very noticeable difference in flavor.  The new machine (has had about 8 or 9 pods through it) tastes terrible; a very acidic taste on the back of the tongue.  I'm guessing that it's overheating the coffee, and am probably going to go through a warranty claim for him, but wanted to check with y'all first and see if there are any tricks to getting this thing working as it should.  I haven't descaled it, as it's new, but should I?",1,1737206030.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
1i478uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/comments/1i478uk/starbucks_plans_to_announce_corporate_layoffs_by/,Starbucks plans to announce corporate layoffs by early March,"Partners, 

In September, we outlined our plan to revitalize Starbucks by focusing on what has always set us apart: a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. 

Since then, we have been enhancing the in-store experience with the return of the condiment bar, writing on cups, more ceramic mugs and a revised code of conduct. We’ve shifted our marketing from discounts to highlighting our brand story and coffee leadership. We’ve taken steps on pricing transparency by removing the non-dairy milk upcharge. We’ve set a goal of a four-minute wait time in cafés and have provided additional coverage hours in over 3,000 stores. We’ve doubled paid parental leave for our U.S. retail teams and aim to promote internally for 90% of retail leadership roles in three years.   

We have much more work to do but I’m pleased with the progress we’ve made and appreciate how everyone has rallied around the plan.  

Our initial work has – rightly – focused on our U.S. and Canada stores and the store experience. However, as we look to transform our business globally, we also need to examine the role, structure and size of our support teams around the world.   

Across our support teams, we have many talented partners with deep expertise and a strong, skilled team that is driving impact for our customers, partners and business every day. As I’ve spent time working with teams across the business and observed how we work, it’s also clear that we have some opportunities to **operate more efficiently**. Additional opportunities include: 

* **Increased ownership and accountability:** We need to ensure all our work has a clear owner, who can make decisions, and who is accountable for achieving the goals. This will help us move faster.  

* **Clear priorities and reduced complexity:** Our “Back to Starbucks” plan is the priority, and we need to stay focused, reduce complexity and remove conflicting goals. 

* **Better integration:** We need to reduce silos and duplication of effort. Our size and structure can slow us down, with too many layers, managers of small teams and roles focused primarily on coordinating work. 

**We need to meaningfully change how our support teams are organized and how we work, making sure that we have the capacity and capabilities to deliver on Back to Starbucks, and are prioritizing the areas that have the biggest impact on the experience in our stores.**   

**We have recently begun the work to define the support organization for the future. We are approaching this work thoughtfully, but it will involve difficult decisions and choices. I expect that, unfortunately, we will have job eliminations and smaller support teams moving forward. This work will not affect our in-store teams or the investments we are making in store hours.** 

**We will communicate changes by early March. I do not take these decisions lightly, and I appreciate that this will create uncertainty and concern between now and then. I wanted to be transparent about our progress and our plans and ensure that you hear about this work directly from me.**  

Thank you for all you are doing.

1i478fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/1i478fw/build_feedback_sim_business/,Build Feedback - Sim Business,"Hey! I wanted to get this subs feedback on the rigs my partner and I are building for a mobile sim racing business. We are building a 20’x8.5’ trailer to look like a race trailer, and will put 3 sim rigs in there with 6” DK6+ actuators for motion. We’ll do corporate events, private parties, cars and coffee, car club meetings, and obviously track days an any racetrack that’ll have us. 


The chassis: the CoolerMaster Dyn x. We went with this because I didn’t want to deal with the potential for loosening bolts from the 8020 and constant motion, and it is a more robust build. Yeah, it’s more expensive, but to does genuinely feel like it can handle whatever idiot is going to roll around in there. 

Petals: Simagic P2000r hydraulic petals. I like the feel of hydrolic petals. 

Wheelbase: I’m going between the simagic alpha ultimate and the simucube pro. I have a feeling simucube will win. 

Wheels: FX Pro from simagic for the formula style wheel and the simagic GT1 round wheel. 

Shifter: I feel like this is a waste of money but someone will want it. Simagic DS-8X

Monitor: Samsungs 57” Odyssey Neo G9. Can’t fit trips in the trailer.  

Custom water cooled computer. 

Seat: I’m really thinking a generic leather/suede  racing seat off eBay. I can get 4 of them for the same cost as a ‘sim racing seat’. But also, since this is a business, and not all our clientele will be as fit as we are, I need something that can handle a larger person, which most racing seats can’t. 

That’s the business. We’ll pull it to events, conferences, and parties for a $2,500 for a 4 hour minimum. We honestly took the golf simulator pricing model and applied it here.

Teeny Tiny Avocadoes 

   * It is one of the world's healthiest foods in a portion-controlled package!

* Purple Sweet Potatoes

* Teeny Tiny Apples 
   * Another win for portion and carb control while still getting your fruit in.  I also love this food, the kids, so much less food waste. 

* Salad Kits - I don’t recommend living and breathing by calories, I like to look at calories and ingredients.  However, if you are tracking your food, calories may matter more to you! Love pairing this with a premade protein for an easy meal!

   * Mediterranean Salad - 100 calories and made with EVOO, so it’s my winner for the healthiest salad kit
   * Dill Chopped Salad - 130 calories/serving
   * Sweet Chili Mango - 130 calories/serving
   * Barbecue & Black Pepper Toscano - 140 calories/serving
   * Southwest Chopped - 150 calories/serving

   * Miso Crunch - 170 calories/serving
   * Pizza Salad - 200 calories/serving

* Lentils & Edamame - great sources of plant-based protein!

* High Protein Tofu - I buy this a few times a year to enjoy tofu.  I literally will not cook tofu if I don’t have it. Who wants to spend hours draining their tofu? Not me, you don’t have to with this!

* Baby beets 

* Pre cut veggies - butternut squash fries, stir fry veggies (so much better than frozen), zucchini noodles, veggie blend, and mirepoix

* All fruit, but especially jicama and dates. 

* Sauerkraut & fermented Kimchi 

Premade Protein 

* Grilled chicken breast
* Roasted chicken breast (contains soy) 
* Meatloaf 
* Chicken Piccata 
* Pulled pork and chicken
* Sous Vide Turkey 
* Turkey Breast Tenderloin 
* Deli Meat

* Sausages 
* Chicken Meatballs 

Marinated Chicken/Steak - I skip it if it has a caramel color added to it!

*  Pesto → cleanest ingredients for chicken
*  Balsamic Steak → cleanest ingredients for steak 
*  Pollo Asada
*  Sundried Tomato 
*  Savory Herb
* Carne Asada

Dips

* Guac
* Hummus - roasted red pepper, Mediterranean, garlic hummus, chili onion 
* Salsa

Pantry

* Pasta nests - great for portion control 
* Brown Rice
* Red Lentil Pasta 
* Quinoa Pasta
* Hearts of Palm Pasta (if you want low carb)
* Everything But the Bagel
* Salmon Rub
* Peanut Satay Sauce - pairs great with chicken tenders in the air fryer

* Chia seeds
* Ground flaxseeds

Frozen 

* Orange Chickn

I have been awarded access to work for taxis to and from work. I was just wondering if the time I get these taxis matters? 

Sometimes after work I find consolation in relaxing in a local quiet coffee shop after just to reset (I don’t like travelling in busy conditions). My normal work times are 8-5. If for example I get a taxi at 8/9pm will I be able to claim this back as it is at a considerably later time that my work time? 

It may be a stupid question, but I enjoy resetting after a day at work.

[Here comes the future, again. Connect Images\/Alamy](https://preview.redd.it/zup9yxj3xqde1.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea74d72483bdfdc7a76a4dd68322e94f8ee0cff9)

The rapid technological advancements of our world have been enabled by our capacity to design and fabricate ever smaller electronic chips. These underpin computers, mobile phones and every smart device deployed to date.

One of the many challenges is that electronic components generate increasingly more heat as they are miniaturised. A significant issue lies in making the wires which connect the transistors on the chip thinner while ensuring that the minimum amount of heat is released.

These interconnects are typically made from copper, and as we start to scale them down to nano-scale thicknesses, their electrical resistance increases rapidly because the electrons moving along the wires have a higher probability of colliding into the surface of the wire. Known as scattering, this leads to energy being released in the form of waste heat, meaning you need more power to maintain the same level of performance.

A group at Stanford University has [published a new paper](https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/new-ultrathin-conductor-nanoelectronics) showing that thin films of a material known as niobium phosphide (NbP) exhibit much higher conductivity than copper below a thickness of 5 nanometres (nm) (the typical thickness of the wiring in today’s chips is about 10nm-30nm). This improvement is because NbP is a material with unique quantum properties.

NbP is in a class of materials known as topological materials, which have unique electronic properties due to their atomic structure and were the subject of the 2016 [Nobel prize in physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.20722#:%7E:text=British%2Dborn%20theorists%20recognized%20for%20work%20on%20topological%20phases.&text=David%20Thouless%2C%20Duncan%20Haldane%20and,materials%2C%20known%20as%20topological%20phases.). Their conductivity along the surface is extremely high and stays the same regardless of changes to the shape or size of the material (physicists refer to this as a “topologically protected surface state”).

In other words, it is robust and not easily destroyed by reshaping it. Even when the material is made thinner, bent or given ridges, the special conductive properties that can be observed on the surface remain present.

# This is important, as the ability to decrease the thickness of the electrical interconnects while still allowing electricity to flow easily is key to balancing the fabrication cost and complexity against energy efficiency. This gives NbP a significant advantage over other materials.

# Disorder vs order

What is particularly remarkable about the discovery by the Stanford team is that these quantum properties were observed in disordered films, meaning the niobium phosphide wasn’t fabricated in the most controlled way to maximise its conductive properties.

There’s a good analogy in making bars of chocolate: it’s vital to control the cooling process of melted chocolate to create the glossy end-product that you’re used to. This process is known as tempering. Anyone who has tried this likely knows how dull and soft the untempered version can be – and how it affects the taste.

The difference between tempered and untempered chocolate is the size of the individual crystals within the chocolate’s structure (or to put it another way, the amount of ordering). Untempered chocolate contains multiple small crystals that are disordered with respect to one another. To make tempered chocolate, a manufacturer will cool it in a controlled way and also add a piece of tempered chocolate to promote the growth of a uniform crystal structure.

[Nanowiring has a heat loss problem. Manoranjan Mishra\/Alamy](https://preview.redd.it/tyl8mi8axqde1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=314feba0fd8cf8dade87720229ba30a11d837b54)

Now imagine how useful it would be if you could simply skip this tempering. Not only would it make the production process more efficient, it could also decrease the energy required. This is essentially what the Stanford team have shown in relation to their material.

To put it in technical terms, the niobium phosphide had no long-range order. This means that while it might have contained some of the small crystals that you would associate with an optimum version, the material was considered a disordered alloy overall.

Despite this, it was still an excellent conductor for an ultrathin film, seemingly due to the exotic quantum phenomenon of topologically protected surface states. If this effect can occur even in a disordered material, it greatly simplifies the manufacturing process – with positive implications for the costs.

This shows how quantum effects could lead to such significant improvements in conductivity, potentially enabling us to produce more powerful and energy-efficient computer chips in the near future. One important question is whether enough niobium phosphide could be available for manufacturing purposes.

[Niobium mine in Brazil, which has the largest deposits of the element in the world. Pulsar Imagens\/Alamy](https://preview.redd.it/nzktzuyhxqde1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=44e7e3f2e21db5096a138651fb4dc34f700b2d22)

While this is not our area, [phosphorus is almost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust) as plentiful as carbon in the Earth’s crust, while niobium is about one third as plentiful as copper, roughly comparable with cobalt and nickel. That suggests sufficient supply, though specialists would have to weigh the relative cost of extracting these elements from their ores.

For those of us working in this field, the discovery also raises the question of whether other topological materials such as [tantalum phosphide](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.9b09997) and [tantalum arsenide](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c00669) could behave similarly. Also, what is the essential ingredient that the NbP samples possess for them to act in this way? These questions will continue to engage scientists in their search for solutions to enable lower-power computing technologies of the future.

My friend has a dozen goats and he wants us to come help him move them from one pen to another.  He wanted help yesterday but he had a nanny drop a kid yesterday morning and got nervous about disturbing them so this morning it is.  My kids LOVE to go help with the goats.

This is a very linear vanilla scent, but that doesn't mean bad. Has a slightly woody base, nothing more to it than that. Very realistic gourmand. £65 for 70ml at bloom perfumery. 7.5/10

Maison Margiela - Jazz club:
The first fragrance that sparked my interest for perfumery as an art, rather than to impress people. This has been reviewed many times, and some may say 'overrated' but i disagree. This is an incredible boozy scent, and i can't see myself not having a bottle of this in my collection anytime soon. I don't pick up on the tobacco notes so much, which is a shame because i'm a big fan of tobacco in perfume. 
£100 for 100ml 8.5/10

Bon Parfumeur - 802 pivione lotus bamboo:
As i've read in other people's reviews, this is a mix between an aquatic blue fragrance and a floral green fragrance , or a 'turquoise' fragrance. This is a very refreshing green watery fragrance, i received it today so i can't exactly tell you my experience with it. This was a blind buy, and i'm very happy with it. £40 at bloom perfumery at the moment for 100ml
8/10 

Issey Miyake - Leau d'issey pour homme sport 
This is a very citrus heavy fragrance with a slight spice to it and some wood notes at the heart. This is a very nice freshie which doesn't follow the same lines that most brands go down. This was the 2nd bottle in my collection, i believe i purchased it at Knock airport on the way back from visiting my family in the west coast of Ireland. £25 for 50 ml at the airport 6.5/10

I have other bottles in my collection (dior sauvage edt, montblanc legend spirit and prada luna rossa ocean) but i figured that they have been reviewed allot. I also have samples of Zoologist's hummingbird, elephant and penguin, Parfum prissana's mohagrot, Imaginary Author's a whiff of waffle cone, eight and bob's annicke 4 and nuit de mageve, franchesca bianchi's the black knight, pierre de valay's chou chou and floraiku's one umbrella for two. 

This is my first proper post so if you would like an in-depth review of any of the fragrances mentioned, or any of the samples then just let me know. Hopefully i will start posting more, depending on how this post goes. ",9,1737203063.0,fragrance,4,0.68,False

It's just eggs, yogurt, flour or cornflour, sugar and vanilla or cocoa powder right? Salt and baking powder too.

I sub the whole eggs by all egg whites and sugar by erythritol. I haven't tried corn flour, only regular. Could that be it? Would love to add banana/pumpkin/zuchinni to make it higher volume or bread like but that has always failed too :(

If anyone has a fool proof recipe to share please🙏🏻 Tiya!

1i46fw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1i46fw7/hm_scary_red_flag/,HM scary. red flag?,"Hello, I arrived to my HF in the US 4 days ago. The HD is fine and very kind to me, the HK as well (11M) but the mom is very.. strange. First of all, I haven’t seen her smile ONCE since I’ve arrived and maybe it’s normal but I come from a very friendly and warm country. That’s not an issue though, but it is intimidating trying to joke with her and her looking at me with her dead eyes.. second thing, their previous AP is here and she is by far the sweetest and nicest girl I’ve ever met. 

Yesterday and two days ago she was working the mornings (6:30-8:00) and I’ve told both the HP that I want to rest but I will join the in the afternoons to watch and see what she does with the HK (that’s what I did). Yesterday the HM calls me and was talking in a very passive agresive way, asking I haven’t joined them in the mornings and now she doesn’t know how I will manage the mornings since the AP leaves Sunday and I am working Monday morning. I told her I understand but she hasn’t asked me to, she just assumed I would and I basically had to apologize for her lack of communication. (My flight was 13 hours, happened many things along the way that she knows of and I told them already I need to rest and get used to the time zone difference, but if she would’ve asked me I would’ve joined in the mornings!) 

Yesterday (Friday) me and the AP made plans to go downtown because she told me it’s very alive and beautiful there on Friday evening, we told the dad and he was more then fine with it and was happy that she was showing me around, later we told the mom after she got back from work that we are going out and she was asking her “how many times did you drive up there?” And the AP said 4 times, and then the mom was like “no, you guys aren’t going.” (Without any explanation or even apology for deciding that for us?) I’ve been independent since I was 14 and me and the AP both come from dangerous countries so her saying that put me off entirely. One thing that I couldn’t stand is someone controlling me and it felt like that.

Right after, the dog was licking a chocolate yoghurt that the HK was eating earlier off the table, it was for 2 seconds and I noticed and took it from her but the mom literally caught the dog’s two ears (they are very long) and she pushed the dog’s head backwards and screamed at her very loudly “NO!!” Repeatedly and then slammed the dog’s body onto the floor very aggressively. I was in utter shock and she was like “sorry about that” and continued her business. I went to my room and cried because it was scary, especially since I’ve JUST got here!!! 

And I can see the way she speaks to the other AP she is very controlling and demanding. I told her I wanted to go to a church on Sunday nearby (10 min drive) and she was “I’ll see their website and get back to you”, and then afterwards she told me that their website pushes “gender norms” and that only male and female is normal to them, so she doesn’t allow me going there. I mean, I’ve read it and I get it but it’s a church? Idk?? And I was seriously researching that church for two months and now she just forbids me going there. I feel so trapped, I literally flew across the country to have more freedom and she’s treating me like her child. Her other AP’s were very sweet and gentle and people pleasing and I am the same way so I fear that she is going to use that to her advantage too.. I feel so uncomfortable, nobody made sure I eat (they haven’t toured the kitchen and fridge for me, I tried by myself but everything is different). Luckily the AP helped me make breakfast but lunch and dinner and non existent for me right now. Nobody asked me how I feel so far. Oh and me and the AP were making coffee in the kitchen two days ago and the mom came back from work and just trauma dumped on us everything (mind you, this is a day after I’ve arrived) and it was like for an hour straight talking about her problems and her personal life which made me very uncomfortable since she was waiting for us to advise her on those things? Very strange behavior.. and I am missing home more then ever and just wanna leave. 

Sorry for this being long, I’m not sure if I’m exaggerating or not.. me and the AP went to the room after the dog incident and she told she never saw her that scary and that if she was me she would’ve thought that was a massive red flag.. I feel trapped and alone and that I’ve made the worst decision coming here. The HK has ADHD too and he had multiple outbursts at the previous AP but he’s been nice to me so far, but it’s a matter of time. They disclosed the ADHD and his meds but didn’t tell me about the multiple mental breakdowns he has. Idk what to do at all. ",4,1737202956.0,Aupairs,8,0.83,False
1i46f6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/IllusoryPalinopsia/comments/1i46f6t/i_feel_so_stupid_right_now/,I feel so stupid right now.,"I'm 23 years old and have unknowingly experienced many symptoms associated with VSS (Visual Snow Syndrome) in a mild and benign form for most of my life: BFEP, floaters, vertical ghosting, and possibly very subtle palinopsia. I've never consumed drugs, alcohol, coffee, or antidepressants. While I don’t have a formal diagnosis of OCD, I exhibit strong OCD traits and have been diagnosed with health anxiety.

In the month leading up to Christmas, I was constantly overworking myself—balancing university studies, work, and playing ranked computer games whenever I had a moment to spare. I barely ate and only managed about four hours of sleep each night. By the end of the month, I felt my neck was perpetually tense, and I developed a mild but constant headache during the last two days. Then, on the final day of the month, I experienced a severe migraine, which temporarily caused partial loss of my peripheral vision in both eyes. It was the first migraine of this magnitude I had experienced in 10 years.

About a week after experiencing a migraine (roughly a month ago), I started noticing something that I felt was unusual. Sudden hand movements seemed to leave faint trails in my peripheral vision. At first, I dismissed it, thinking, ""It’s nothing significant—just objects on contrasting backgrounds causing motion blur."" However, I was already anxious, and this added to my concerns, so I began paying closer attention.

A quick search on the internet led me to discover palinopsia, and that’s when the paranoia started. I won’t lie—I became hyper-focused on it. I began scrutinizing every lamp, light, or bright object, analyzing whether they left trails. If I stared directly at an object, it wouldn’t leave a trail. However, if I moved my eyes sharply to the left or right, a trail would appear, originating from the object’s previous position and stretching to its new one. This trail moved in a clear direction.

For the past month, this fixation has consumed me. I’ve barely worked, avoided watching movies or shows, didn't listen to any music and stopped playing games—terrified of noticing something ""off."" I’ve spent hours staring at reflective objects in my room, moving my eyes so quickly and sharply that they sometimes hurt.

When I \*slowly\* move my finger, watching behind it on a contrasting black surface I can see bluish silhouette moving behind it. At some point I noticed that the black objects on contrasting backgrounds leave trails, or silhouettes too, even though it's far harder to notice them. But, as I said before, I had a lot of time to practice.

Did I... break my brain? Or could it be just some sort of flare up of Illusory Palinopsia? Or my health anxiety making me hyperfocus on something normal? Please give me your opinion.",1,1737202878.0,IllusoryPalinopsia,0,1.0,False

That's what I'm told I've got. The looks, voice, style, charm, brains (and modesty, I swear 😂) that a woman wants.

But I'm so over regular dating apps, matching based on superficial looks; I'd rather have deeper discussons about passions and dreams, and if spark fly and chemistry sizzles, then take it from there.

Instead let's bond over shared passions. Mine include voracious reading; doing things with my hands (DIY, cooking, gardening); history and current events; and dissecting a good book or movie. Good coffee or wine is always welcome - you bring the charming company, and we're all set!

As for you. You want to be stimulated in mind, body and spirit by a charismatic gentleman who doesn’t just light fires, but sets them ablaze? Then bring me your slow-burn energy that leaves a man wanting more.

My dreams have always been extravagant, rare as they are, yet I try to live life with only the most basic of pleasures. My first thoughts on this chilled ice covered morning were of a nice cup of coffee and You. 

I tend to think of you on the colder days. I find myself on occasion wondering how you would handle some of the lower temperatures here, you after all aren’t exactly accustomed to the negative twenty degree windchill we are expecting this coming week. I ask myself what you would consider a cold morning, personally as long as it isn’t below 30 I am nice and toasty warm wrapped in linen cloth to stave off the chill.

I wonder what it would feel like to experience your warmth, not the heat of the weather around you, rather the heat your soul emanates just due to your very existence. I know I need to stop writing you, I’ve done a lot of growth and development since we first met, I’ve become the man I wanted to be my entire life but, I’m still missing the bravery required to send you these messages directly in fears of straining our amazing friendship, though I doubt you would allow it to affect us whatsoever.

Still though, on days like today when thoughts of you flood my mind before I have the chance to pry my eyes from their rest, I wonder to myself if you feel even a portion of the electricity I feel between us, can you detect the sparks as well? Probably not, I romanticize reality, awaiting some magical film moment in which everything just clicks so, it’s entirely possible that this chemistry is simply of my imagination. I tend to overthink everything but I find myself unable to overthink my way out of these feelings I have.

I hope it’s a nice warm yet cool day, I hope you got plenty of restful sleep last night, hopefully your life and your mind have settled from where they have been recently. I hope every day is just filled with the same beautiful blessings you’ve provided me with in this short span of friendship. I apologize for so many writings about you, it is after all the only way I know how to express myself, English is a passion I adore getting to use. Anyway, as I feel this cold morning air blowing through the thick layers of clothing I donned this morning, I think of you, I just felt you should know.

As I work on dialing in my ZP6 and brewing method, I’ve been focusing on another critical variable: proper coffee resting. 

Interestingly, when I reached out to roasters' customer service, their recommended rest times were much shorter than I expected for the beans and processes I’m using:

    •    Bean & Bean Coffee: 7–10 days from roast
    •    Onyx Coffee Lab: 5–7 days from roast
    •    Klatch Coffee: Starting at 5 days from roast

I’m curious to hear your thoughts and recommendations for beans I currently have active or on order. 

My general goal is to push toward the 4-week mark for most beans, with Naturals possibly benefiting from closer to 5 weeks. Open to suggestions for what most consider the sweet spot here.

I had helicobacter pylori 13 months ago but I cured it with quad therapy. (Breath test and gastroscopy urea test confirmed it gone)

Since curing it my gastritis didn't stop, my stomach still hurts. Difficulty passing stool, often runny stool. Sometimes an acid reflux (though rarely because I don't overeat.)

A gastroscopy last October (same one that confirmed negative urea test for hpylori) displayed build ups of yellow bile, and an irritated stomach lining.

From googling and asking around my guess is that the pyloric valve isn't closing and ends up releasing too much bile. The question is how do I get it to function properly again? I couldn't find a medication or other type of treatment for this specific problem (or symptoms for that matter.)

But I also tried to go to my grandma's last weekend to stay the night and get away from her and I've been taking care of nana during the weekdays and I end up having to during the weekend too because no one else really does their to busy doing other crap and before she was bed ridden I had to watch and make sure she didn't go outside because she's fallen out there on the steps and such before and we live in kinda a woodsy area and we didn't want her going in the woods or anything so one night they let her go outside and she got all the way up the drive way and keep in the mind that drive way is really long so it took her a good at least 20 to probably 30 minutes to just get up there and let alone get down the steps and to the actual mail box so there's no way she just disappeared for a quick second which is what she claimed then another time her and her husband were doing something in their room idk what but either way they weren't paying attention to the monitor and she got out of the house with her walker so that took even longer and no one came out to check on her nothing so back to what I was saying so I had asked and she had the absolute nerve to tell me that I'm not gonna he able to go over to her house every weekend and she makes it so I have a break like no you don't because I'm still doing the absolute most around here and I always will be because I'm apparently the parent and I have to keep the house clean take care of nana and do school stuff all while keeping my dog content and finding time to take care of myself. But let me go ahead and tell you how she talked about my dad before he passed and how she still talks about him after he passed before after she'd pick me up from seeing him she'd make up random stories about him and tell me on the way home like bad stories where she's the victim she does the same about me and everyone else and when I'd tell him about them he'd tell me what actually happened and I'd ask my grandma too on both sides before my grandma on my dad's side died but then after he died like right after I got home from my step mom's house because he was supposed to come home on hospice the day after so I was just gonna stay the night so I could be there when he got home but he went to the home in the sky so I had just called my mom and asked her to come get me and take me home which she did and when we got home and I was in my room with my stuffed animal he gave me with I was 5 and had patched up countless times because if how I held it we had to preform emergency restuffings she had the nerve to ask me if I had ever had sex at the ripe age of 10 as I was in my bed trying not to cry and she at one point took my door off because of the way it shut you kinda had to slam it for it to latch and she didn't belive that even though she knew that was how it shut she still took my door off for 6 months then lied that she didn't know where the pins and stuff was to put it back on so I showed her where she laid them at and she was mad at me for that so she grounded me from my door for 2 more weeks then when I had just started school I've always been scared of like groups of people right and so I was always scared to go to school and because I was getting bullied since the first day basically i never wanted to go back but anyways she had told her mother in law to use a switch on me for it so I called her Re so Re had told me that she had bought me a pair of pants and she wanted me to try them on and had used the switch on me for a good 15 minutes and my mother had come and picked me up while I stood in the middle of the living room sobbing with my pants in my hand because yes I had been spanked and all before and smacked and all but never switched so it was quite the surprise then the other time that I vividly remember is when I told my mom I'll make her breakfast the following morning so I bad got up a bit earlier and had started her coffee once she had told me she was up and I made her something that I knew was her favorite which was oatmeal so I made it and brought it to the table and made it look nice and at that moment her husband walked in with her some takeout breakfast and she ate his breakfast and flipped her shit because I was upset that she didn't eat the oatmeal I had made her so she followed me to my room and started slapping me and I had put my hands up over my face to like keep my face from getting it which really annoyed her so she had punched me a few times all while her husband watched but that's all I'm gonna write mainly because I feel the urge to cry from going back and thinking of this stuff. I'm extremely sorry that this has been a run on sentence I was trying get the memories out as quick as I remembered it all. I'm also sorry to waste everyone's time.

Our sage Oracle is nearly 2 yrs old. Have used same beans since the start, fresh bag every 2 weeks approx. Since Xmas the tamper doesn't tamp, it's like the grinder keeps going then times out. If I click grind again it might tamp immediately or grind for a few seconds and then tamp. However it's obvious then that too much coffee is in the portafilter as nothing comes out in the brew. 
Right now I have it at grind size 20. 25g of coffee comes out of grinder yielding 41g of coffee when I brew for 29 secs. I just measured using kitchen scale for this post.
If I grind finer it will def time out. If I grind courser the water/coffee flies out! 
I have cleaned everything, for the bristles and Hoover into the grinder etc. What changes to the settings should you suggest we make? Thank you in advance!

One such standout piece that is gaining popularity is the concrete coffee table. With its sleek, industrial charm, a [concrete coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/monet-concrete-cloud-coffee-table-white) can easily elevate the aesthetic of any living space, adding sophistication and character in an instant. Whether you're designing a modern, minimalist, or industrial-inspired interior, a concrete coffee table or even a concrete side table can be the perfect addition to complete your look.

# 1. The Bold and Modern Appeal of Concrete

Concrete is often associated with industrial design, and rightly so—it carries a sense of strength and durability that instantly adds a modern edge to your living room. A concrete coffee table stands as a striking centerpiece, commanding attention without overwhelming the space. Its clean lines and solid form create an architectural focal point that complements a variety of other materials, such as wood, metal, or glass.

The raw, unfinished aesthetic of concrete adds texture and depth to a room, making it the perfect contrast to softer furnishings like plush sofas and soft textiles. Whether it's a simple, minimalist design or a table with intricate, sculptural features, a concrete coffee table can be the anchor for a bold living room aesthetic.

# 2. Versatility in Design

One of the biggest advantages of a concrete coffee table is its versatility. Concrete can be molded into almost any shape, allowing for endless design possibilities. From geometric, angular tables to smooth, rounded surfaces, a concrete coffee table can be customized to fit any style or preference.

In addition, a concrete coffee table pairs effortlessly with various decor styles. If you have a modern or contemporary living room, a sleek, polished concrete coffee table will complement the clean, simple lines of your furniture. For an industrial-inspired space, choose a raw, unfinished concrete table to add a rustic touch. Even in more eclectic or bohemian settings, a concrete coffee table can introduce an unexpected yet sophisticated element that grounds the room.

To further elevate the design, consider pairing your concrete coffee table with a matching concrete side table. [Side tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables) made of concrete create a seamless transition between your main furniture pieces and help unify the overall aesthetic of the room.

# 3. Textural Contrast and Balance

A concrete coffee table introduces texture in a way that soft fabrics, wood, or metal cannot. Its raw, rough surface or polished, smooth finish provides a striking contrast against the other materials in your living room, creating visual interest and balance. For example, if your sofa is upholstered in soft velvet or linen, a concrete coffee table’s cool, solid surface will provide the perfect counterpoint, enhancing the visual appeal of both elements.

This textural contrast is especially effective in modern or industrial design schemes, where the combination of soft and hard materials is often key to achieving the right balance. The tactile quality of a concrete coffee table also encourages interaction—whether you’re placing a drink down or simply admiring its design, the texture adds a sensory layer to the experience.

# 4. Durability and Functionality

In addition to its aesthetic appeal, a concrete coffee table is incredibly durable and functional. Concrete is one of the most robust materials available, making it an ideal choice for furniture that will stand the test of time. Unlike wood or glass, concrete resists scratches, dents, and the wear and tear that can come with everyday use. This means your concrete coffee table will maintain its beauty and functionality for years to come, making it a wise investment for any living room.

A concrete coffee table is also easy to maintain. While it may require some periodic cleaning to avoid staining, its surface is resistant to spills and scratches, making it perfect for homes with busy households or high traffic areas. If you opt for a concrete side table, you’ll enjoy the same level of durability and ease of care for smaller surfaces that can double as both functional pieces and striking decor elements.

# 5. Pairing Concrete with Other Materials

One of the unique features of a concrete coffee table is its ability to complement a wide variety of other materials. Concrete, while sturdy and heavy, is surprisingly versatile when it comes to mixing with different textures and finishes. For a luxurious contrast, consider pairing your concrete coffee table with a glass top, allowing the raw texture of the concrete to be visible while maintaining a sleek, elegant design.

Wooden accents, whether in the form of legs, handles, or decorative objects, can also pair beautifully with concrete. The warmth of wood creates a perfect balance with the coolness of concrete, ensuring that the living room feels inviting and grounded. If you prefer a more industrial look, pairing a concrete coffee table with metal elements, like steel or iron, enhances its rugged appeal while maintaining a sophisticated edge.

# 6. Concrete Coffee Tables for Small and Large Spaces

Concrete coffee tables work well in both small and large living rooms. For smaller spaces, a minimalist concrete table can create a clean, unobstructed view, making the room feel more spacious. Its solid form without any excessive detailing means that it won’t overwhelm a smaller area but will still serve as a statement piece.

In larger rooms, a concrete coffee table can help anchor the space, drawing the eye to the center of the room and tying together the other design elements. A larger, more sculptural concrete table can serve as the focal point of a room, ensuring that your furniture arrangement is both functional and visually striking.

# Conclusion

A concrete coffee table is a powerful statement piece that can elevate your living room's aesthetic with its bold, modern appeal and versatile design. Whether you’re looking to add texture, contrast, or durability to your space, concrete offers a timeless material that complements a variety of interior styles. Paired with concrete side tables or other materials like wood and metal, a concrete coffee table can create a sophisticated, balanced look that makes your living room a space you’ll love to spend time in",1,1737202303.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

This is often called lack of motivation, but I don't think it is:

It's misdirected motivation.

I'm always motivated to doomscroll X/Twitter. Or Substack. Or watch brownie recipes on YT (I must have watched 50 videos about the chewiest, fudgiest brownies you ever ate). Or make coffee. I grind the beans, boil the water, and make a perfect cup of coffee. Oh, sometimes I switch and make tea. Sometimes I change seats. (I'm semi-retired and make my own schedule.)

Isn't that motivation? But I'm not motivated to clean my mess of an apartment, or to get back to finishing the first draft of my 2nd novel.

There are other things but I've made my point.

I don't think my problem is motivation, per se, because I am motivated to do some things. Unfortunately they are things that prolong my state of paralysis. So what is it?

I’m 22 years old. It feels like I’ve been this way for years. I started taking coffee when I was in highschool, maybe once a week, as a treat and not as a necessity. Caffeine has always had a big effect on me and one shot of espresso would give me energy for the entire day.

After finishing school and university being mostly online because of the pandemic I’ve become an extremely tired individual. Nothing would work, I’d skip classes, sleep until late, if I forced myself to wake up and do something I would drag myself back to bed an hour later because I was so tired. I have times when it gets slightly better, usually in the warmer months, but in general I sleep 9 hours every night and if I don’t drink coffee I feel groggy the entire day.

Recently, because I’m quite busy and feel like I’m falling behind on everything (basically I waste entire mornings I could spend studying, working out, dedicating myself to hobbies I have not touched in years), I ask my family to bring me coffee to bed (which I understand sounds so entitled, but it’s the only thing that will get me up before 8am) and I’ve considered getting one of those timed coffee machines that you set up the night before and makes coffee automatically, so that I can keep this habit up without bothering the rest of my family. 

It looks like a decent solution, but I feel so dependent on caffeine. Once the effect runs off I get headaches, really bad anxiety and feel even worse, and if I drink another cup I can’t sleep at night, which makes me wake up even later and goes against the whole point: I want to wake up early.

I’ve tried energizing teas, mate, eating big and nutritions breakfasts, but nothing improves my mood and energy in the morning quite like coffee. I want to quit at some point, but getting into this habit of coffee being the very first thing in the morning feels like taking a huge stepback.",1,1737202229.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
