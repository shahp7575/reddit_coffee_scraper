# Background

For context, I am a man. I am 35 years of age. I have never had a lucid dream in my life (not that I'm aware of anyway). I have gone through my life with a very weak relationship with my dreams. I never really took them seriously and never really remembered hardly any of them. I would remember remnants of my dreams here and there but mostly I'd just wake up and be aware I had a dream but the memory would be gone in 10 minutes and I would start my day. I've had quite a few nightmares which were easier to remember.

I have struggled with trauma, social anxiety, general anxiety, bullying, low confidence, and addictions pretty much since my childhood. I had a good upbringing but something was wrong with me due to confidence and a lack of ability to connect with people.

I've lived quite a directionless life. I am a good person with a good heart and never go out of my way to hurt anyone. I've led a life of feeling lost without knowing who I truly am.

It is since the Covid lockdown of 2020 that I really started to work to clean up my body, mind, and spirit. I did anything I could to try and help myself. I started meditating (its effectiveness started when I learned proper techniques regarding posture and breath), working out, eating healthy, and working on my mental health. I got more deeply into spirituality over the past few months.

# What I Think Contributed to My First Lucid Dream Experience

I got more deeply immersed in my spiritual side in the past 5 or so months. I have always believed that there is something more to our reality than meets the eye but never delved more deeply into contemplation and being aware of it.

These past 5 months have been a different journey in that I have devoted my time to getting to know myself more spiritually and discovering more about myself and the universe around me. I have delved into a number of spiritual books that have included the topics of lucid dreaming but also dream yoga for spiritual purposes as well as meditation and Kriya Yoga. I got much more serious with my meditation practice and aimed for a consistency of at least one half an hour session per day, usually aiming for an hour. I have also been working on releasing my trauma through Trauma Release Exercises (TRE). I am currently over 4 months into my TRE journey.

Naturally, from my spiritual pursuits, I got interested in lucid dreaming and dedicated time and consistency into trying to ingrain it into my subconscious. It took me 2 and a half months to have this first lucid dream with near daily practice of the following things:

* Reality checks - throughout the day when I had a moment to spare and remembered, I'd do a number of reality checks and try to rewire my mind to question reality. I would count my fingers, try to breathe through pinched nostrils, try to put a finger through the palm of my hands, check the time etc...
* Dream journal - any scrap of dream fragment I could remember I would jot down into my phone. Later in the day, I would record this into a Word document on my laptop. I would read through my dream journal periodically when I felt like it
* Affirmations - reading daily (some misses here and there) affirmations related to being a lucid dreamer. The affirmations are in the present tense and are positive. I aimed to read these 5 or so affirmations as a group for 10 minutes each day
* Wake-Back-To-Bed (WBTB) - I have practiced this technique a total of 22 times with all of them being unsuccessful. This morning's successful lucid dream wasn't from an intentional WBTB although I did wake up and go back to bed
* Mantras - When I go to bed and am letting myself fall asleep, I'll repeat as many times as I can, these mantras: ""I am aware within my dreams"" and ""I will remember I'm dreaming""
* Meditation - I have been meditating for 4 and a half years now but they have always been very short 10 minute sessions. Don't get me wrong. Quantity does not equal quality. I did increase the session times to 30 minutes to 60 minutes but I also aimed for quality by learning proper posture and breathing techniques
* Trauma Release Exercises (TRE) - it is my opinion that TRE has helped massively as my energy systems are slowly healing allowing me to access deeper and higher states of awareness and consciousness more easily

# My First Lucid Dream Experience in Detail

On the morning of 20/12/2024 which is a Friday, I woke up at 4am with the intention of hitting the gym at 6am when the doors open, so I could get my workout in before starting my work day. I went through all the usual motions of the morning. I got up, went and made a cup of black coffee, did my breathing exercises, did 30 minutes of meditation, and then decided I did not feel up for the gym today (as is the case sometimes when one isn't feeling strong enough mentally). I went back to bed and relaxed. I lay on my left side and closed my eyes. I thought to repeat my lucid dreaming related mantras. I slowly drifted out of consciousness and into sleep.

My dream began fully non-lucid. I first saw myself staying in a couple's home as a guest. I was speaking with the woman before her partner was trying to put something onto the table in front of me. I helped bring the table closer to him.

I am then walking around my city trying to get home. It is dark at night. I am wandering around and am lost. I light up a cigarette and puff away as I try to find my way home. It feels realistic, the way I take a drag from this cigarette and the taste of it as well as the smoke coming out of my mouth. I looked into the pack of cigarettes and saw there were a few more left (I gave up smoking in real life over 4 years ago and wont go back to it. In the dream, before becoming lucid, I was kind of thinking why am I smoking? I told myself it is a one-off. I was aware that I am disciplining myself in all respects). I then decide to look for the nearest train station to get home. I can't find a train station and decide to ask a lady for directions. At first, I can't see this lady due to the dark. It is as if I am fully blind. I then am able to see her and she tells me the direction to go in. I go in that direction but it looks like the entrance to an underground car park. When I enter it, I am in a dimly-lit room. I see a couple having sex on a table. I hide out of sight behind another table because there is someone approaching. After that person has left, this is the exact point I become lucid in my dream.

I realize I am dreaming! My mind starts to speak! I say to myself ""This is a dream right now. This is not real"". At this unbelievable realization, I slowly rise from my hiding place on my feet and look at my environment in front of me pondering the reality of where I am at. I step forward and decide to try and change my environment. My attempts don't work. When I close my eyes and open them, the area I just came from is now a bedroom of some sort with a bed, a lamp, a bedside table, and a mirror. I decide to investigate and explore further. This room is very pleasantly lit with a warm and glowing yellow light. I go towards this room and when I enter before investigating further, I am filled with excited emotions. My conscious mind is aware that excitation could cause me to lose lucidity so I work on calming my heart and breath down. It works and I am more calm. I start my exploration and investigation of this room. I notice on the bedside table a mysterious looking book. I touch it, look through its pages, and look at its contents. None of its contents make any sense to me, and I now cannot remember what I saw in this book. I remember feeling a real sense of awe and amazement as I inspected and examined this book. The interactions with it felt so real. I could feel it physically. I could hear the sounds it made as I went through its pages. Simply amazing. After examining the book, I noticed there was a mirror to the left of me. My conscious mind instantly became curious as to what my reflection would look like to my dream mind. I peered into the mirror from its left corner and saw a figure. It looked somewhat like me but the reflection was foggy and unclear. Like a dirty mirror. At this point, my conscious mind is getting more excited again. I decide to try and manifest an attractive woman here into my room. My attempts are unsuccessful. Not too long after, I start becoming aware that my lucidity may be weakening. My vision is starting to blur and break up. I am aware the lucid dream is going to end. My conscious brain remembers my lucid dream studies and tries the ""spinning around"" technique. I spin around a number of times and feel dizzy in my dream mind. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and the dream has ended. I wake up back in my bed in real life.

I am very excited and start recoding all details into my phone at 7:15 upon waking from my first lucid dream.

I thought to share and document my first lucid dream here with all of you. Hope you enjoyed reading it.",1,1734696721.0,LucidDreaming,1,1.0,False
1hiih1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentSupportCircle/comments/1hiih1v/8_steps_to_manage_your_time_better_as_a_student/,8 Steps to Manage Your Time Better as a Student,"This is a call out post directed towards anyone who has ever frantically worked on an assignment a few hours before it‚Äôs due, running only on iced coffee and the promise of a giant nap later.

Folks, this has to stop.

Time management can be tricky for students because schedules are busy, procrastination is common, and the internet is just so darn distracting. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve put together our best tips for better managing your time and actually getting stuff done with as little stress as possible.

# Figure out what you‚Äôre doing right now

Before you start trying to overhaul your entire life, take a day or two to figure out what it is you‚Äôre doing¬†*now*. Keep track of how you‚Äôre spending your time -- like how many times you reach for your phone in the middle of a study session, or what kinds of tasks make you start daydreaming 10 minutes in. Basically, you‚Äôre gonna act like a zoologist observing a lion out in the wild, except you‚Äôre somehow both the zoologist¬†*and*¬†the lion (woah).

What you learn from this will inform what you need to change (or maybe even what to keep, if you‚Äôre already doing things that work for you).

# Make a schedule, not just a to-do list

Knowing what you have to do is a good first step, but knowing¬†*when*¬†you‚Äôre going to do it is the real key. So bust out your calendar app and block off some time to get stuff done. Yes, you do have to write it down (either virtually or physically) because it‚Äôll help you remember and stick to it. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt trust you to keep mental tabs on things...it‚Äôs just best to not take any chances.

When you get assigned something, add it to your running to-do list. Then when you have a chance later, put dedicated time in your calendar to work on it (always assume you‚Äôll need more time than you think). Your to-do list gives you an idea of all the things you need to get done and a place to jot them down quickly -- like when you‚Äôre in the middle of class or a club meeting. Your calendar is where the real planning happens, and it‚Äôll take a little more thinking in terms of scheduling (more on that below).

# Break it up, and spread it out

The fastest way to get overwhelmed by a project is to try and do it all in one sitting. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have all of Sunday free to get your research paper done -- if you‚Äôre opening a blank document in the morning and turning in a draft in the evening, you‚Äôll be stressed all day. Instead, break it up into baby steps, and spread them out over time.

An 8-page research paper can be split up across a week (or more) by researching one day, outlining another, and then writing a page or two each day until the deadline. With enough time, you can spread your work into SUPER short sessions, like 20 minutes each day over the course of a month -- that‚Äôs 10 total hours of work that‚Äôll feel no heavier than an episode of¬†*Friends*¬†each day.

# Seriously, make it itty-bitty, baby steps

What do you do when a step that‚Äôs already broken down still feels like a huge hurdle? Go¬†*smaller*. Take our previous example -- starting to do research for your paper is a good first step, but it might not¬†*feel*¬†any less intimidating than writing the whole thing. So take steps within the step (step-ception, if you will).

To get research done you have to:

* Get out of bed (we‚Äôre assuming you‚Äôre marathoning those¬†*Friends*¬†episodes right about now).
* Get your computer.
* Think about the questions you want to answer.
* Open a document.
* Write your questions down.
* Open a browser.
* Search them.

And that‚Äôs before any actual research even gets done. Maybe you can‚Äôt imagine yourself \~researching\~, but getting out of bed or opening a document isn‚Äôt as much of a stretch. It‚Äôs all about how you‚Äôre¬†*thinking*¬†about the work that motivates you to do it (or not). Take a tiny step, and then another, and then another, and eventually you‚Äôll be making some real progress.

# Schedule around your own needs and rhythm

Some folks work really well in the morning, some folks are more productive at night, and some folks are at their best under a full moon (...okay, that last one was werewolves, but the point remains). Whatever works for you is what you should schedule around.

That means that your most important work (big presentations, papers, and projects) should happen when you have the most energy. All the smaller stuff (like easy worksheets or short readings) can wait for those times when you‚Äôre not necessarily on your A-game.

The same applies to the length of your sessions. You know yourself best, so you can make the call whether to go for shorter sprints or longer stretches of work. There are plenty of methods to choose from, from the fast-paced¬†Pomodoro method¬†to the longer¬†ultradian rhythm technique. Find what works for you!

# Schedule breaks and fixed stop times

Your calendar isn‚Äôt just for work -- it‚Äôs equally important to make time for fun. Remember those steps we talked about? Take little breaks as needed between steps and tasks. Grab lunch in the middle of your study session, or take a quick walk between researching and outlining your paper. These buffers will clear your mind and give you something to work towards when you‚Äôre, well, working.

Be sure to also block out clear end times for tasks. If you‚Äôre giving yourself Thursday night to work on your study guide, mark in your calendar that you‚Äôll stop at 9 p.m., and then¬†*actually stop at 9 p.m.*. Knowing when you‚Äôre going to stop keeps you from thinking you have all day and goofing around or putting stuff off until later.

Pro tip: whether you‚Äôre taking a break or stopping for the day, make a little note for yourself about what you did and what you need to do next so that you can easily pick it up the next time.

# Clear your distractions

Look, we both know that it‚Äôs really easy to get distracted from work -- especially when it‚Äôs work that you‚Äôre not too wild about doing. The biggest distractor is probably your phone (because slime videos, deep-fried memes, and your friends‚Äô snapchats are just a few taps away), so here are some quick ways to keep your focus where it needs to be:

* Put your phone on airplane mode, or mute notifications.
* Make your phone password annoyingly long (like 20-30 characters).
* Temporarily delete the apps that distract you most.
* Or disconnect from wi-fi and block mobile data on those apps.
* Just put your phone in a different room entirely.

# Address¬†why¬†you‚Äôre procrastinating in the first place

Okay, time to get a little real with you. These techniques can help you manage your time better, but it‚Äôs also worth getting introspective about the reasons why you might be procrastinating or avoiding work in the first place.

For a lot of people, it boils down to a fear of failure or criticism. Writing an essay may feel hard because you‚Äôre worried that your words won‚Äôt turn out the way you want them to. Tackling a big presentation may be intimidating because you don‚Äôt want to embarrass yourself in front of your classmates. It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt do the work, you might just be paralyzed by the thought that it has to be perfect.

We can‚Äôt magically make those feelings go away, but we‚Äôre here to tell you that no one expects your work to be flawless, and fear shouldn‚Äôt stop you from trying. At the end of the day, you have to turn in¬†*something*, so take it step-by-step, get some work in, and edit as you go -- once you‚Äôre actually doing it, it‚Äôll feel so much easier.

‚Ä¢Probiotics
Lactobacillus/bifido are good to use after the MMC is running.
S. Boulardii: Avoid fungus like this one, heard bad things about it.
Spore based like bacillus: Avoid! So many horror stories, impossible to kill.
Kombucha: Contains fungus, beware.

‚Ä¢Calcium deficiency
I assume most people here, like me, are dairy intolerant. Avoiding dairy is important in the healing process.
People talk about Magnesium all the time, never did anything for me.
Calcium is critical for the MMC to work! Pure Calcium carbonate, in between meals, helps noticeably.
Other forms like Malate can be taken with meals.

‚Ä¢Digestion starts in the mouth
Chewing properly is so important.
Avoid too much water with meals until 2hrs after.

‚Ä¢Supplements 
Ginger-Artichoke extract, like the reasonably priced California Gold Prodigest, is THE supplement for sibo. I learnt of it thanks to the famous ""How I cured my sibo"" guy on YouTube.
Antimicrobial teas like organic chamomile, peppermint... are great.
One supplement I would avoid is methyl-b12/methyl-folate. So many people get insane anxiety from it, look up the posts on reddit, it's overrated. Also if you're not iron deficient do not take iron pills as it literally feeds sibo and h pylori.

‚Ä¢Caffeine
Coffee, green tea, chocolate never did any good and made things worse many times. I would avoid them.

This is for one person, which is why I thought I might get away with 1 garden for 2 or 4 and grow meat and dairy alternatives in it.

As an alternative I could do soil grow, Amazon basic shelves, adjustable, with led lights, but that is more complex but might fit what I want to do better for less money?

1hii4fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1hii4fp/why_do_people_ignore_me/,Why Do People Ignore Me?,"For years, I‚Äôve been struggling with connecting with people, especially when it is not in person.  Since graduating several years ago and reaching out to reconnect, I‚Äôve been ignored a lot.  I would send a quick message and say I hope things are well or congrats on the marriage, job, kids, etc. and never hear back, even though it says they have seen it.

I just don‚Äôt get it.  You would think, even if I didn‚Äôt study with them or even know them as well, they would at least acknowledge it or say thanks.  I would think people of similar backgrounds or interests might want to spend a few minutes with it.  Likewise, I can‚Äôt think of me doing anything that would justify them going no contact.  I can only think of one time where I got upset at someone and told them to F off, before coming back a few minutes later and apologizing.  I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but they must have pretty thin skin if that is the worst they have heard.

I know people are busy and have their own problems, but that excuse doesn‚Äôt impress me.  My life has been very easy compared to so many, but it still had its difficulties.  I‚Äôve worked full time since I was 22, and was in school or working part time since I was 18.  I‚Äôve struggled with OCD, migraines, job loss, work stress, school stress, rejection.  I grew up with loving parents, but money was often tight and this caused a lot of disagreement.  I think much of the issue was my dad had undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia.  He lost his job after getting quite sick with Hep. C (back when chemo was the only treatment).  Thankfully, he got better.   My mom had breast cancer more recently, but thankfully it was caught early and treated.  Sorry if that was a bit of a rant, but it felt good getting it out.  And I should mention that I have never told anyone of those things, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to dump that on them.

But despite that, I still make time for people.  I would still get back to someone who reached out to me, even if it is just a sentence.  Sometimes I did it out of feeling interested.  Other times, it was out of politeness.

I feel like there are only two reasons that it could be:

1.  I come off as overly friendly.  Sometimes I might get a bit overly enthusiastic about talking with people.  I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve often been shy in life, so feeling I can reach out to someone, and having the courage to do so can be somewhat exhilarating.  That and I like to inject a bit of passion into life.

2.  Sexuality.  Recently, I‚Äôve come to the acceptance that I am at least bi-curious if not bi.  This was a tough road filled with confusion, anger, shame.  I still haven‚Äôt told anyone yet.  I never asked any one of these people out on a date, nor did I ever make any sexual advance or even joke.  The only thing I can think of is if I subconsciously displayed some more feminine traits at times, and they falsely thought I was asking them out if I said let‚Äôs hang out, grab a coffee, go to a party, etc.  I had no romantic interest in them.  And even if I was gay, I think it‚Äôs pretty bad to assume that every conversation I have is intended only for sex and that I am incapable of friendships.  

So, what do you think it is?  Should I take a more neutral approach to people, or is it just that some people don‚Äôt how else to say no?  Or am I just dealing with assholes?",1,1734695368.0,emotionalintelligence,1,1.0,False

I'm a 25yo woman who has a group of friends from highschool and became close friends with one of the girls. 

Right now, everyone has a degree or finished masters degree except her because she can't get past some subjects and she seems like she froze at 15yo because the only conversation topic is series and hot actors and being obsessed about them (which is totally valid but the problem is that it's the only thing she talks about because there's nothing going on in her life and she has no dreams or plans, she froze in time). Back in time I tried to give her advice but she ignored so I gave up, I did my best as her friend.

The problems started when everyone in the group but her got a boyfriend and she started to get jealous of me in particular. She envies my hair because it grows faster, my clothes, my nails even if I don't paint them, everything. 
She often invites me to grab a coffee only the two of us to ask me a ton of questions about my life and my boyfriend so I started to avoid being alone with her and texting her and became a little distant from the group in general.

Last time we met to celebrate the birthday of one of the friends she was always trying to see my messages (I was telling my boyfriend at what time I was heading home) and talked about how she likes to check mine and my boyfriend's zodiac news of the day and she checked that she has a better compatibility with my boyfriend than me...

In conclusion, I hate seeing them and hanging out with the group because of her and I have to make a decision between leaving the group and disappearing completely or trying to preserve the friendship with the other girls that I like, knowing that she won't disappear and I'll have to deal with her if I want to be friends with the other girls.

1hihz73,https://www.reddit.com/r/nomadandinlove/comments/1hihz73/dance_moped_how_to_fix_error_code_99_shown_on_the/,‚ÄãDance Moped: How to Fix Error Code 99 Shown on the Display of a NIU Scooter,"If you're ever encountered error 99 on your Dance moped, then you'll know that the NIU scooter is pretty much undriveable. A quick search online will reveal that there is an electronic components communication failure or main harness issue.

Dance's solution is to leave the key turned to the right in the lock and wait a few minutes. And that the error on the display will disappear. But that doesn't always work, at least for me anyway.

The actual reason for the error is interference between the moped and satellite. The scooter has likely been parked next to a high-rise building without the battery connected for a long period of time. And when you try to start it again, the error displays.

In order to clear error code 99 on your NIU scooter, you need to do the following:

* Turn on the Dance moped. Make sure that the error is displayed.
* Disengage the kickstand and manually move the moped away from the building (under clear sky).
* Keep moving the scooter until the error disappears and the battery indicator displays its level. You might have to move it for several meters. I moved it 30 meters before it worked.

And that's it. Your moped has now established communication with satellite and is good to go again.

I'm a 25yo woman who has a group of friends from highschool and became close friends with one of the girls.
 
Right now, everyone has a degree or finished masters degree except her because she can't get past some subjects and she seems like she froze at 15yo because the only conversation topic is series and hot actors and being obsessed about them (which is totally valid but the problem is that it's the only thing she talks about because there's nothing going on in her life and she has no dreams or plans, she froze in time). Back in time I tried to give her advice but she ignored so I gave up, I did my best as her friend.

The problems started when everyone in the group but her got a boyfriend and she started to get jealous of me in particular. She envies my hair because it grows faster, my clothes, my nails even if I don't paint them, everything. 
She often invites me to grab a coffee only the two of us to ask me a ton of questions about my life and my boyfriend so I started to avoid being alone with her and texting her and became a little distant from the group in general.

Last time we met to celebrate the birthday of one of the friends she was always trying to see my messages (I was telling my boyfriend at what time I was heading home) and talked about how she likes to check mine and my boyfriend's zodiac news of the day and she checked that she has a better compatibility with my boyfriend than me...

In conclusion, I hate seeing them and hanging out with the group because of her and I have to make a decision between leaving the group and disappearing completely or trying to preserve the friendship with the other girls that I like, knowing that she won't disappear and I'll have to deal with her if I want to be friends with the other girls.

Like moments slipping through time's sands
The leafs tremble in the breeze
While memories float through autumn trees

I've gathered all my courage now
Yet still I wonder when and how
The words I've carried all these years
Could turn to whispers, drift to tears

The street where once you used to walk
Still echoes with unfinished talk
These flowers, fragile, fresh and new
Hold everything I couldn't do

You stopped appearing in my dreams
Loving you platonically is too much it seems
My soul is unwilling to let you go
Trying to find solace or facing a blow

Each morning brings another chance
To break free from this hesitant dance
But here I stand, just like before
Behind an impossible unopened door

The coffee shop still serves your greet
In cups where bitter meets the sweet
While I rehearse what I might say
If fate should guide you here today

These roses speaking in my place
Tell stories time cannot erase
Of all the words I left unsaid
Of paths untaken, books unread

The city moves in endless motion
While I stand frozen with my emotion
These flowers wilting in my grip
Like chances that forever slip

Perhaps some love is meant to remain
Unspoken, like the cold summers pain
That falls so gently in the night
Then vanishes in morning light

Regardless still I stand here, day by day
With fresh-picked flowers on display
For though time's river always is of the essence
The heart holds on to it like it's fluorescence",1,1734694615.0,justpoetry,0,1.0,False

My best girl friend (27f) got into a situationship w my best guy friend (27m) when I left the country. She was fresh out of a toxic relationship and I warned them both they were not on the same page-- that he was single and ready for a relationship and she wanted to see what was out there. She has a history of cheating (multiple times, with multiple men) and everyone warned him but he wanted to believe she wouldn't do it to him. He had never been in any relationship. She cried bc people were calling her a cheater and ""holding her past against her"", and I told her it wasn't long enough ago for ppl to forget and the only way she could change that is by changing her behaviour. I fought everyone for her and said she had changed and she was not going to do it because she led me to believe she had. She promised me she wouldn't cheat on him, or take him for granted, and after 6 months of their intense situationship despite her saying she's not sure abt a relationship and him wanting one, and saying he was fine to continue as long as they were exclusive, I told them to figure this out asap bc I saw this ending badly, and if it did I wouldn't be in the middle. They told me to mind my business and politely fuck off.

6 weeks later she cheats on him in a club with all of his friends there, in front of everyone. My brother, who is also his best friend, takes a 3 second video of her flirting, feeling, and dancing with him-- it was enough. I was sick to my stomach, and didn't speak to her for 2 weeks, and she apologised for putting me in this situation. I spent hours convincing my guy bsf to not post that video on his story. In the beginning I tried my best to be there for her because I knew she needed a friend, only to have it backfire on me a few weeks later by my guy best friend who continued to force me to cut her off. He didn't want to me to stay friends with her, and was upset that I was helping her get through this. At that point I decided to take space from both of them (I had so much else going on myself), and told them I would because I couldn't see how I could do right by one without doing wrong to the other. I also told her I was hurt that she hurt someone I love, which to me is a given not do when someone is your best friend (?) and that I can't trust her to think of anyone (me) before she does whatever the f she wants, while remaining entitled to my being there for her because we were so close

She was visiting where I live about a month later bc she has other friends there, and when I reached out to meet her she dodged me, lied about her plans, said she wasn't going to be in the city and I saw on her stories she was. Asked her again if she wanted to meet-- dodged me completely. Meanwhile, she's posting subliminal stuff on her instagram about being betrayed and hurt by people and how some people aren't real if they're not there during the tough times. Two months later I move back home, reach out to her for a coffee and she proposes another date. I told her I wasn't in town then, and when I got back I asked when she wanted to meet. She replied saying she's still very hurt and betrayed and needs her space. I was furious! I'm reaching out to her, because I thought she felt too embarrassed and ashamed to make the first move. Gave her multiple olive branches. I let her know that although she apologised for putting me in a tough situation, her avoiding meeting me to talk it out despite months of my trying to be a good friend says otherwise, and it seems she's using my reaction to a situation she created, and my need for space as a wrong toward her rather than seeing why I was in that position, the hurt and betrayal I felt, and taking accountability for where we are in the first place. She didn't reply. I guess she's sick of being told to take accountability. it's been rough because i can't talk to anyone about this since we live in a small town and we all know each other. at the end of the day, she was my best friend and i don't want to speak badly of someone i was so close with for so many years

I don't know if I'm being too hard on her, because I genuinely feel betrayed by the fact that she cheated again (it has nothing to do w me, I know), that she hurt someone I love, and is playing the victim in a situation she created imo. More importantly perhaps, I'm torn between being compassionate to someone who has been a ride or die for 8 years, and has been with me through thick and thin, and wondering whether I can ever trust her to be truly loyal to me (or anyone for that matter), and ik it's not right to hold everyone to the standards you hold for yourself, but I like to think of myself as loyal to a fault. I don't know whether to end the friendship mentally and move on altogether, or decide accept an invitation to sort this out if and when it ever comes ?

November 29th, 2024.

One of the best days of my life. I bought my first car - a 1986 BMW 325i.

Not the most responsible decision, taking a five-figure loan for a near 40-year-old car, but fuck it, this was a dream come true for me.

The car seemed to be in mint condition - in and out, had all the paperwork since it was first sold, relatively low mileage and the test drive went well. Maybe it was too good to be true, but I so badly wanted it to be true, so I went through with it without doing my due diligence.

The initial service cost was significant, but I promised myself that I would not compromise on this car - I wanted to own it till the day I die.

Fast forward three weeks, I was watching a StanceWorks video where he reveals the E30 he bought, a 325e. Funny, because that car has the same redline as mine - 4500 RPM. He also showed another E30 that he bought to strip down and use as parts for his actual build. The scrap car was a 325i with a 6500 RPM redline.

Of course, I panicked and jumped onto Reddit, where the community confirmed my fears. I had indeed bought a 325e.

I'm embarassed and heartbroken.

Don't get me wrong, I love my car, but knowing I got scammed still sucks.

There's nothing I can do now except make the best of it. I hope nobody I know sees this, but I had to let it out somewhere.

Quiet as a mouse all night in his crate, but once I get up and let him out to start my morning routine he whines incessantly until I take him on a run. He does NOT have to go pee. Even if I let him out back in the yard, he will just stand outside and whine at the door.



In the grand scheme of things it's not a huge deal, but it's kind of the last thing I want to hear in the morning before I've had my coffee and do my own business. Ignoring him hasn't worked (he's two, and it has happened for two years). 



Is there really anything I can do other than just accept that he's a 90lb toddler? I've tried leaving him in his crate until I'm ready to take him out, but he whines there too. It's only when I wake up, not the rest of the family. My kids can get up before me and he's totally fine. ",1,1734693073.0,OpenDogTraining,2,1.0,False

1hihi69,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hihi69/trust_issues_with_girlfriend/,Trust issues with girlfriend.,"24M with a girlfriend of one-year who also happens to lie now and then. Tells me stories I really don‚Äôt believe in because she‚Äôs broken my trust for a couple of times already. 

There‚Äôs this guy in her uni who‚Äôs into her and she knows it but still went out with him for a coffee (not like in a date, but like a casual hangout). If I ask her about it, she turns defensive. She prolly stalks him a lot too but tells me how she doesn‚Äôt (I literally caught her stalking him on Instagram). There‚Äôs been similar instances with a couple of guys before.

Every time I catch her telling a lie, I confront her and she‚Äôd come up with the question ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you trust me?‚Äù and I go back trusting her.

She has always been secretive about her Instagram. Like she‚Äôd restrict me or hide me from her stories no matter how many times I tell her it bothers me. For instance, last month we fought over something really stupid and she hid me from her stories (fine). I use my other account, open her stories to find out she‚Äôs enjoying brownies and movies with her girl friends in the middle of the night. And then dares to tell me she was all alone and grumpy.

Not to mention her ‚Äúnothing for good‚Äù friends take most of her time. Jesus, atp I don‚Äôt even know what I am doing. 

I am not like this in general. I have never harnessed this much hatred and bother before for anyone. Ever. 

I need your suggestions on this. Like the only reason I am with her is because I am still in love with her. BUT IS LOVE ENOUGH?

TL;DR!- Having massive trust issues with my girlfriend. Lying, Being secretive, Posing Infidelity threats and whatnot. ",2,1734692750.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1hihdxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hihdxr/my_sister_and_i_grew_up_abused_but_now_im/,"My sister and I grew up abused, but now I'm abandoning her without telling her ","My sister and I grew up abused and bullied because we were the weird poor kids in a very rich type though public school. I'm the oldest and have always been the defacto golden child because my sister was from kindergarten socially isolated by the adults around her for expressing violent behaviour. Which was absolutely her adhd combined with her getting abused.

I've grown up as my sisters father and mother, I'm myself a trans man (born a woman) and have taken on the role of big brother, father and mother for her because our parents weren't there emotionally for either of us. We both still live at home, free of charge. I promised her since she was 16 and I 19, that I would help her escape and she could live with me so she didn't have to worry about school and keeping a roof over her head. 

This was halfway done out of guilt for when I was much younger when my treatment of her wasn't the best. Ontop of being her only parent, taking the brunt of the abuse and being my fathers incestuous crutch when life didn't go his way or his girlfriend (now wife) broke up with him or they argued. Our family knows this happened and have happened since I was 5, no one said a thing. 

She's recently begun turning violent again when you ask her to do anything. Our stepfather is quite severely abusive, not physically, but emotionally and mentally abusive. Towards the both of us. She's not handling it well though she has nowhere else to go as neither of us really speak with our father.

Today, after I told her to take her plates out, yes I did keep asking, she started jokingly sitting down and just paying attention to her phone and I said to do it again, in which she, seemingly (I do have autism and I am bad at reading people, I will admit that much) out of the blue stood up pissed off at me and yelled, ""You are not my parent! Stop saying that! I'm going to my room so I don't beat you up!"" Which is a credible threat as she does have martial arts knowledge and is physically a hell of a lot stronger then me. 

I spoke with my friends about it and they all agreed that it's not right of her to say that and I fully do know that partially I am responsible for her flying off the handles like that. But at the same time, we are both young adults with the excat same sets of diagnosis. Autism+adhd combo with a nice C-PTSD ontop to even it out. We are both prone to a big of anger but I've learned to manage mine and severely matured despite it all. She hasn't. She's been coddled for a long time.

I'm starting my internship soon, it's a year and I'll be fully done with my education, it's a trade, I'll be quite young and with adult money, previously I've said to my sister I would mover her in with me here and support her as she took her electrician education, but now, because she's only getting more and more angry, though she hasn't resorted to alcoholism again, I have chosen to give up on her for now. I can't afford it mentally, it stresses me out which is not good for me specifically as my body's stress response is giving me psychosis where, and this would get to this point I can tell you that much from experience, everything I eat becomes rotting human flesh in my mind. I could be eating a burger and know it's a burger but my mind and taste buds would still see it as rotting human flesh. There would be the smell of decay everywhere and even my beloved morning coffee becomes irony and thick as though it was blood. I need to prioritise myself for the first time on my life and she needs to mature and get her shit together. I'll tell her that I'm not moving out with her when I myself do finally move out. I'm hoping it will lead her to finally start saving money like she said she would and that she can afford too, because again we live at home free of charge.

I do feel immensely guilty about this, because that's my sister, I've protected her as much as I have been able too all my life with all these things going on, and I can't do that anymore, not without harming her more. ",2,1734692266.0,confession,3,0.58,False

We live 20 minutes apart, so not far at all. I (f,35) have tried reaching out numerous times over the years (like once every couple of months) to get together,  to just chat, get coffee, anything. I‚Äôm usually met with silence, or delayed responses by like 2 weeks. Then when I do get a response, it‚Äôs chipper and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I‚Äôve been so busy. I can‚Äôt hang out I‚Äôve got work and I‚Äôm depressed so I can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù But then I see them hanging out with other friends on FB. I did call her out on it once and she apologized and said she‚Äôs been so depressed that she can‚Äôt even talk to anyone‚Ä¶But goes out with others the following week.

The last straw for me was when my mom died. My mom was like her second mom growing up. Just like her mom was to me. I reached out to her because I needed my friend. I got nothing from her. Three weeks later, her other friend‚Äôs (Sam) mom died (whom I knew for a long time and was a wonderful human.) Kim was going over to Sam‚Äôs all the time and comforting her and being there for her. It was blasted all over FB. 

After I saw this, it finally clicked that I don‚Äôt matter. A couple years go by where I just stopped reaching out. Well, I posted some memes on FB about friendship and what a true friend really is, with no context to them. I didn‚Äôt tag anyone, I didn‚Äôt add any of my own words, it was just a meme. Kim was triggered and said that true friends don‚Äôt need to talk every day and true friends don‚Äôt be mean to their friends who are depressed, etc. She‚Äôs right. However it goes both ways right? True friends don‚Äôt ignore their friends in their time of need and grief. True friends don‚Äôt play a depression card with you, but will go out with others. She accused me of having hate in my heart and that she has decided to root for me from afar because she doesn‚Äôt need my negativity in her life. 

AITAH for posting the memes and expecting my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to be there in my time of need and wanting her to treat me like a friend like she does her other friends? Or was I just chasing her around for years like a lost little puppy dog? ",2,1734691966.0,AmItheAsshole,4,1.0,False

I have to be honest, I enjoy a good glass of wine or an espresso from time to time. But the improvement in hot flash frequency has been worth it.

1hih46f,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1hih46f/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Here‚Äôs a hilariously helpful guide to get you strumming your way through tunes in no time. 

**Step 1: Listen!** üéß
First things first, become a human boombox! Listen to your song over and over. Pay attention to the notes, chords, and melodies. Trust me, repetition is key (no pun intended!). 

**Step 2: Choose Your Poison: Lead or Rhythm** ü§î
Decide if you're gonna be the rock star or the steady heartbeat of the band. Lead guitar struts while rhythm keeps it smooth & groovy. Both are important, but each has its vibe! 

**For Rhythmic Guitar:**  
- **Step 3a: Upstroke or Downstroke?** Up-down, up-down! Get comfy with the strumming patterns. Some songs only use simple patterns‚Äîthink ‚ÄòZombie‚Äô by The Cranberries. 
- **Step 4a: Chords, Baby!** Learn your chords and their variations. Changing a single note can change the vibe of the song like magic! üé©‚ú® 
- **Step 5a: Chord Progressions Are Your Friends** üéâ 
Start looking for patterns! Most songs have a repeatable chord progression that‚Äôs easier to remember than your ex‚Äôs name.

**For Lead Guitar:**  
- **Step 3b: Get Those Riffs, Then Make Them Yours** üé§ 
Nail the riffs first, then sprinkle your style. Melodies are where the heart is! 
- **Step 4b: Scale Up, Don‚Äôt Panic!** When mistakes happen (and they will, trust me üòÇ), scales can save the day! Practice the pentatonic scale like it's your morning coffee. 
- **Step 5b: Explore the Fretboard** 
Get adventurous! Different points on the fretboard can make your guitar sound like a pop star or a rock legend.  

**Step 6: Record Yourself** üé§üìº
Finally, record the rhythmic part and layer the lead on top. It'll make you feel like a rock god.  

Follow these steps, and you'll be shredding guitar solos in no time. Who knows, you might even impress yourself (and your friends)! Happy jamming! ‚úåÔ∏è

I wanted to share the experience launching my first-ever app, hoping it might encourage some other new founders out there to take the leap. This journey has definitely shifted my perspective on a lot of things!

I just on a passionate whim launched¬†[Fyenance](https://fyenanceapp.com/), a personal finance app I built just over the weekend, mostly for myself, and decided to share it with the world. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much.. just wanted to see what would happen to put it out there.

Well, here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been going so far..

* 60 paying users already, just from a couple posts and word of mouth
* $400 in revenue - just organically!
* The feedback has been incredibly validating, especially hearing how much people appreciate the app‚Äôs simplicity.

Fyenance was born out of a personal need. As someone who‚Äôs tried nearly every finance app out there, I always felt like they were overcomplicated or just too hands-off. I wanted something that felt more intentional‚Äîsomething I could sit with for a few minutes each weekend, coffee in hand, to truly understand my finances.

The app is super simple:

* You manually track your finances, avoiding the miscategorized chaos of automation.
* It‚Äôs beginner-friendly, with an intuitive design.
* It focuses on making you feel connected to your budget, not overwhelmed.

What‚Äôs been most surprising is how much people resonate with this concept. It turns out I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs been frustrated by existing tools.

While 60 users might not sound like a lot, to me, it feels like a massive milestone‚Äîespecially since this started as just a small personal project.

If you‚Äôve been sitting on an idea, unsure if it‚Äôs worth launching, my advice is to just go for it. You don‚Äôt need everything to be perfect or polished. Sometimes, all it takes is putting yourself out there to see what happens.",1,1734690296.0,microsaas,1,0.67,False

We've been friends for 7 years and I've started having strong feelings for him a year ago. My feelings are pretty strong and like nothing I've ever felt before. I've never said anything to him as I value our friendship a lot and after all, we are in a working environment. In our office they call us the ""work spouses"". We are in different floors/departments but we are always together. We eat lunch together every day, have coffee breaks together every day, take breaks together, etc. He helped me get a promotion, he helps me with everything work related but recently he started helping me with more personal issues, such as investments, taxes, etc... he always helps me although I never ask for help, he said he feels protective of me and wants to make sure I'm OK. He brings me my favorite dessert sometimes, he brings me drinks in work events, makes me coffee, texts me after work and sometimes on weekends too, he is the only one concerned about me when I'm on sick leave and last week he drove me home after the office Christmas party because he said I was too drunk to call a cab (he said he didn't trust the drivers). He seems to dislike my other male friends in the office and he can be a bit rude to them sometimes, the other day he left the table at lunch because one guy joined us and started chatting with me.

Do you think he has feelings for me or is this just a good friendship? Is it normal to be this close with a coworker?",1,1734690149.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

Can anyone please tell me my body will magically fix itself if I just ignore this shit hard enough? 

For real tho‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really sure how to view this‚Ä¶ how to deal with this mentally. I just avoid avoid avoid and I feel like I need to stop ignoring it.
