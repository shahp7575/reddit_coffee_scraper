1kairap,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1kairap/intergenerational_trauma_changes_our_sense_of/,Intergenerational Trauma Changes Our Sense of Reality 😵‍💫,"I need to vent all this out just so I don’t feel completely insane! I was together with my family today, Grandmother, Mom & Aunt (her daughters), and me. My mom is the only one with children, and I am the eldest as well as, not quite the “black sheep,” but the “oddball” which I’ve come to accept 🤷🏽‍♀️ Not to get into too much detail, but I’ve fallen on hard times, and while I know my family means well, they trigger my mental issues A LOT more than they assist and understand them. They 100% know I’ve been diagnosed with at least depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and that I take meds for it every day. My mother also knows sometimes I dissociate pretty bad which causes my personality to fluctuate in a way. This isn’t about my mental issues entirely though, this is about how my family’s dynamic is so unhealthy, but they think it’s normal! 

I got into an argument with my mom. She’s often very passive, to the point she will neglect things (or people, even herself) to keep things seemingly smooth and easy. I offered her advice on a situation she’s in, and essentially she told me to mind my business, it wasn’t my place to question her. My grandmother and aunt agreed with me, but still sided with my mother, which is the usual pattern because she’s stubborn and they pick and choose when to argue with her. 

A short while later I told my mother she hurt my feelings, not by saying it wasn’t my business, but that it wasn’t my place. Her precise words were “besides, you don’t have a leg to stand on.” I felt like she was implying since I’m relying on her right now for assistance, I no longer get an opinion on anything, so I asked her what she meant, specifically with that phrase. First she claimed she didn’t say it, (toxic trait #3 in my family), then she claimed she meant she didn’t want to discuss her problem anymore and why am I making a big deal about it (toxic trait #2). I further stated it’s not her situation, as much as I’ve told her recently she’s been mean to me, very negative and dismissive and it hurts, and since an example JUST HAPPENED I wanted to address it right away since every other time she “doesn’t know what I’m talking about.” Again, she stated it meant she no longer wanted to have that conversation, that I am too sensitive, and she also didn’t want to have this conversation and just wanted to “keep the peace.” She left the room and I quietly teared up while making myself coffee. 

My aunt came in, saw me crying, and asked what was wrong. I vaguely gestured at Mom’s room and shook my head in a “it’s the same thing, different day, I can’t right now” type of way. My aunt immediately said I can be upset but I don’t have to always cry (again, trait #2). She then began peppering me with questions about my life plans which I was tired of answering bc everyone else keeps asking me the same things and I’m already super stressed. Now I was peak frustrated and emotional and crying even more, trying not to have an anxiety attack. My aunt again asked why I *had* to start crying. She noticed my hands at my sides balled into fists, which is a sign of me trying to keep myself together, and then she started in on me that there’s no reason to feel upset, that we’re “just talking.” But what triggered me into full meltdown was her saying, “We’re just trying to help you and you don’t tell me or your mom anything.” I FLIPPED the fuck out, screaming I’ve told Mom ALL of it every other day bc it’s all she brings up & I can’t handle being badgered from every direction when I’m not doing anything wrong. I try SO HARD to stay out of trouble with my family, and it’s never enough! Mom is so rude to me and all I wanted was for her to be less negative. 

My aunt is already a loud, forward woman, like me, so she gets furious when anyone raises their voice to her even though she had just been doing the same thing. She said I’m one to talk about my mom when I am rude and disrespectful all the time. At that I totally shut down. There was no winning. I sat down in the guest room and cried. They shut the door and the three of them went along like “wow, that was so crazy, she always makes everything a big deal, what even is her problem” and they began playing cards. 

Maybe 20 minutes later I enter the living room with a pencil and paper, in a semi-dissociative state. They asked if I wanted to be dealt in, all cheerful, like I just got home. I sat and said tell me what I’ve done. “Tell me how I’ve been rude and disrespectful so I can change.” They looked so confused. I said I want to change, but in my head I’ve been trying to be on my best behavior, so I need to know what I’ve been doing. Just like I was trying to tell my mom how I felt, I wanted them to tell me. While my mom often says things she doesn’t mean, my aunt usually doesn’t, so if *she* was saying I was some type of way I wanted to know.

It was like I grew three heads. 

Mom told me to stop being ridiculous. Grandmother asked if I honestly was expecting to write things down (I have a BA in English. I write everything down🙃). And my aunt said we all do upsetting things in general to each other, but then we get over it. 

The personality state I was in didn’t understand. I was told I’m not one to talk about how I’m treated, when I behave just as badly, so I wanted to change that. I didn’t want to behave in a negative way. I wanted to fix it. They said to let it go. Let the past stay in the past. My aunt even said “Sometimes I say something hurtful to your mom, sometimes my mom says something hurtful to me. We all say hurtful things to each other. We get over it and move on. Don’t dwell on the past.” (Toxic trait #1) 

I felt like they were playing a game with me. Our “past” conversation was literally that same hour. I again asked, “No, but specifically, I need to know. I’m not ok with being hurtful. I want that to change.” 

👏They 👏did 👏not 👏understand 👏what I 👏was 👏talking 👏about. 

My aunt kind of scoffed and said, “You mean to say you didn’t say something rude to your mom this week?” I said not that I can recall. “You didn’t say something this month? These past few weeks?” I said no. If I ever say something I don’t mean, which isn’t often, I make sure I apologize. My mom didn’t even dispute it. My aunt stared at me like I was MENTAL. 

Finally my grandmother went, “I know! I can give you something specific. We were at breakfast and you got all upset at something and very disrespectful because you refused to leave when we wanted to leave. So you told us to go while you sat there.” I remembered that incident, it happened *last summer.* I was upset because my mom said something nasty to me, I wouldn’t let her blow me off and they didn’t want me making a scene. Grandmother had an appointment in the office next door, so I told them to go ahead while I calmed down and I met up with them when she was done. We all drove home together. 

They looked at me like, “Ah-ha! See!” I glanced at them thinking, *that was the best and most recent example of my behavior that you are using to justify all this? I was quote unquote “disrespectful” over six months ago so I have no right in getting upset with how I’m treated now?* I finally told them I hadn’t considered that disrespectful, tell me what other ways they define disrespect so I can keep an eye out for it. Again, they got so annoyed! 

At this point I could tell the problem wasn’t me. The problem was in asking them for an explanation I was asking them to face their “normal” and acknowledge it isn’t healthy and it should change. By me saying, “Hey, I don’t want to behave the way you are encouraging me to behave,” I was insulting everything they did to deal with how they’ve always treated each other. It was clear what I was supposed to take away: Grandmother treated her daughters in a harsh manner, they were not allowed to argue back, so they treated each other the same way, and now they treat me the same way and I am supposed to accept it the way they did. The way, no doubt, my grandmother did from her parents. It’s so ingrained they can’t understand why I would want to change that. It’s like I’m insulting a personal heritage they were trying to pass on to me. I’ve known for a long time my family dynamic was unhealthy, but it all finally hit me properly for the first time. I was sitting at that table daring to change over 60 years of trauma all by myself. I felt so sad for us, for them, knowing they will never understand why I don’t choose their reality. I felt like an alien. Like something strange for wanting things to be good and actively trying to accomplish that goal.  

By then tears had been falling down my face again and I’d gotten all snotty in my semi-altered state. Mom told me to go wash my face. I didn’t move, but wiped my face with my shirt. Grandmother said, “You see, there you go again not listening when someone tells you to do something. That is disrespectful.”

I don’t feel so good this morning. I feel flat and nauseous. 

Wellll I was sick just now. That was nice. Lovely. Pleasant. I don’t know why? I forgot my medication earlier today so I took it about half an hour ago and then ever since I just felt *sick*. About half an hour before that I had vegemite toast and a coffee. So that’s all gone. I felt kind of funny after that too tbh. I don’t know. Anyway I feel a bit better now having let it all depart my body but I still don’t feel well. I wonder if it’s because I had black coffee? But then I used to always have black coffee. Hm. I hate throwing up. It’s so vile. 

I was reading (skimming through) this article today as it was ways to change your lifestyle to help improve anxiety etc etc *anyway* and it was talking about how the human mind isn’t designed to take on the news of the world the way we do, how it’s designed to live in a small-ish community of around 200 people. So they suggest limiting your news intake and idk. I understand the sentiment of it and it makes sense, but equally… how is being wilfully ignorant helpful? On a larger scale I mean. Does that not just further the wider problem in a way? I mean if everyone switches off to what’s happening outside of their community, or even country, imagine the utter BS that would eventuate? I mean look at the state of some of these world leaders and awful events etc WITH the world watching, what happens when no one is watching? I feel like if the world wasn’t the way it is then sure, it’s a nice sentiment and I think people would - generally speaking - be happier and more at peace in their minds. But we don’t live in that kind of a world and it feels pretty privilege heavy to even feel like you can easily and happily tune out so to speak. I’m rambling and not making any sense or any solid points so I’ll be quiet now. 

Yay fresh sheets :) 

I feel so heinous. I am an ogre come to life. My brows are finally chilling out a bit. And I feel nicer for having a lash lift & tint, it makes them look so much longer? Still mega natural, I just look and feel more put together without doing anything. I don’t like getting them often though, maybe twice a year - typically when I’m feeling hyper uggo. I just feel like I’m quite lucky with my natural lashes and I don’t want to risk wrecking them. 

I still feel sick so I’ve skipped both lunch and dinner but now I feel nauseous from not eating so I think I’ll have some plain crackers when we watch Dexter. 

I feel like everything about myself and my life is all wrong. I know it is but I don’t know what I want. I do know but I don’t know. I think what I’m trying to say is I feel so unbelievably lost. It feels like I’m in one of those seemingly endless white spaces in movies and tv shows and it’s just you and…white. And there’s no sense of direction or destination or anything. That’s what I feel like. And it makes me feel panicked, but not acutely so, it’s just this never ending hum of panic underlying *everything*. I mean anxiety, duh, but it’s just… more. I don’t know. I don’t know anything. I wish I didn’t have to do all of this anymore. It’s an odd feeling where half of you wants to live life and experience so many things, and the other half just wants to give up and is too tired to keep going. I feel caught between the two and yanked back and forth, like I’m the little flag in the rope of a tug of war game and the big puddle of mud below is my mess of a life. Yay. 

Right well time to perk up for time with him, I don’t want to be a debbie downer - I make things difficult and sucky enough as it is with us. It’s also kind of hard to be perky for someone that doesn’t seem to want to be there, like he is late every day lately with some reason or another. I just feel like I’m a chore to him lately. 

That wasn’t perked up. Right I shall post this and then shake it all out and do my damn best to enjoy my time with him. He may not want or like me anymore but I’m still in love with him and love spending time with him.

Just in Time to Assure Us All He’s Not Like the Other Middle-Aged Men Dating a Woman 20 Years Younger.","i was gonna write something personal, but put it in to ChatGPT, and sorry but AI is better at staying on track than i am:

Welp, dust off your copy of The Bell Jar and light a candle made of recycled irony, because BJ Novak — the human embodiment of a lowercase New Yorker caption — is reportedly dating 29-year-old TikTok thespian Delaney Rowe. Yes, that BJ Novak. The man who built an Instagram empire on posting JPEGs of text like he was the Moses of Medium.com, then published a coffee table book with all the visual stimulation of an optometrist’s waiting room.

According to People, the two have been “linked” since late last year, aka spotted loitering in coordinated oat-toned outerwear outside the Bowery Hotel like the opening scene of a Brooklyn breakup film. Delaney, who rose to TikTok fame for doing dead-on parodies of Hot Girl Ennui, now finds herself starring in the real-life revival of The Office, only this time she’s dating Ryan and Mindy’s not here to save her.

No word from Mindy Kaling, who’s too busy glowing and producing Emmy-nominated content to be bothered by her ex reinventing himself (again) as the 48-year-old Gen Z Whisperer. And while BJ’s probably prepping a Notes app “reflections on love and irony” post, I’m over here preemptively rolling my eyes into the next dimension.

Honestly, I felt rather counterproductive, dismissive, and as if I were banging my head against a wall. I was advised to opt for an ""easier"" career. I have worked very hard to get where I am and have a double master's degree, which was another challenge altogether... That being said, I should look for a different therapist for sure. Until I figure that out, I need some advice.

But now that I'm super pregnant (baby 3 coming literally any day now) my almost 4 year old has discovered how fun it is to sometimes sprint away if I'm busy with his sibling. It's starting to drive me nuts because it doesn't always happen, but now because I know he might run I have to take obscene precautions to keep him by me that I didn't used to.

Does anyone have any recommendations for how to fix this behavior?

We all carry those sneaky doubts—“I’m not good enough,” “I can’t do this.” Rivers shows you how to spot those thoughts, question their validity, and replace them with empowering affirmations. I’ve started my mornings with:

 “I have the strength and capability to overcome obstacles.”


2. Build Unshakable Self-Confidence

Confidence isn’t a switch you flip—it’s a muscle you train. Celebrating tiny victories (yes, even getting out of bed on a tough day!) and tracking them in a “victory log” has seriously changed my outlook.

3. Embrace Failure as Fuel

Instead of disguising failure as the enemy, Rivers reframes it as your greatest teacher. I’ve begun journaling about setbacks and what they taught me—suddenly, failure feels like free coaching.


4. Create Winning Habits

Small habits compound into big results. Habit-stacking (e.g., pairing my morning coffee with 5 minutes of gratitude) has helped cement new routines without feeling overwhelming.


5. Master Your Mindset & Get Unstoppable

Shifting to a growth mindset—seeing challenges as opportunities—has made me less afraid to take risks. Rivers wraps it all up by reminding you to keep learning, celebrate milestones, and pay it forward by inspiring others.

My Near-Burnout Taught Me This 10-Minute Motivation Reset: Regain Control & Actually Enjoy the Grind 💪,"**Stuck in Hyper-Achievement Mode? 😰 Here’s What My Near-Burnout Taught Me About Resetting My Motivation in Just 10 Minutes!**

Hey, friends! So, let’s chat for a minute. You ever feel like you’re running on a hamster wheel, just going, going, going... but not really getting anywhere? 🙃 I was that person not too long ago, and let me tell you, it almost broke me. 

I was in this relentless *hyper-achievement mode*. Every day was a checklist; every hour was a productivity race. Spoiler alert: I hit a wall. Hard. 💥 

It was after I realized I was one more late-night email away from a full-on meltdown that I decided it was time for a *hard reset*. So, here’s how I turned that situation around in just **10 minutes**, and you can too!

### 🌟 10-Minute Motivation Reset

1. **Breathe (Seriously, Just Breathe) 🌬️**
   - Put down that coffee and take a minute. Close your eyes and breathe in deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, then out through your mouth. Repeat a few times. It’s like hitting a “refresh” button for your brain!

2. **Change Your Environment 🌍**
   - Stand up! Walk around your space. If you can, take a quick stroll outside. Fresh air does wonders for perspective. Plus, nature is basically a motivational speaker wearing a suit of leaves. 🍃

3. **Write Down Your ‘Why’ ✍️**
   - What is driving you? Why are you hustling? Jot down your core motivations. It’s so easy to forget them when we’re in grind mode. Make it personal, make it real. 

4. **Limit Your Input 📵**
   - Ever feel overwhelmed by social media or even podcasts? Take a *10-minute* digital detox! No scrolling, just silence. It’s amazing how noisy we let the outside world become. Control your input and regain focus!

5. **Set Short, Joyful Goals 🎯**
   - Instead of forcing yourself towards that massive goal that feels like a distant galaxy away, pick something smaller and more fun. Maybe it’s trying a new hobby or finishing that book you started ages ago. Getting small wins can reignite that spark! 

6. **Laugh it Off 😂**
   - Seriously, find a funny video or a meme that makes you crack up. Laughter is super energizing. Remember, work can be hard, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have a bit of fun along the way. 

7. **Visualize Success 🎉**
   - Picture yourself hitting your goals. What does it feel like? What are you doing? Visualization is not just for athletes; it can help you, too. You’re just as capable of reaching your dreams as anyone else!

8. **Gratitude Check 🙏**
   - Take stock of what you have, even on tough days. Write down three things you’re grateful for. Shifting your mindset can really change your outlook on the grind.

9. **Plan a Reward** 🎁 
   - Set a little treat for yourself after completing those daunting tasks. It could be as simple as your favorite snack or an extra episode of that show you love. You deserve those little joys!

10. **Connect with Someone 💬**
    - Sometimes just talking it out, whether with a buddy or even a family member, can be the reset you didn’t know you needed. Reach out and share how you're feeling; you’re not alone in this!

So there you have it! **10 simple, quick ways to hit that reset button** and take back your sanity. It’s all about regaining control of your life and actually enjoying the hustle instead of just surviving it. Life’s too short to be burnt out, right?

I've been acting professionally for like 5 years and I'm now in my mid twenties. I keep having this problem where people I've either worked with once briefly (like on a short film) or are distantly acquainted with (i.e. we know each other's work and are insta mutuals) will get in contact for presumably networking purposes - either to go to a film premiere / theatre opening night or they'll explicitly ask to ""talk about a project"" over coffee - but then they'll try to unexpectedly turn it into a date. I've been put into extremely uncomfortable and even unsafe situation because of this phenomenon.

Here's my problem: networking is important. I know that. And more than half the time when people say they want to meet up to discuss a project they actually do just want to discuss a project, which this has led to many professional opportunities, tbh. I'm also fine to simply grab a coffee and talk art with an artist. And love going to premieres, film festivals, theatre (both fancy and blackbox!!)

But when this happens I just feel so disrespected, like my work doesn't matter. It's also making me really hate men as a whole, which I know is not healthy. I hate the way (some of them) USE my work to get close to me. And I don't know how to navigate it - I try to always be a kind, personable and respectful person but I feel like that's their invitation? And extracting myself from uncomfortable situations always feels like burning a bridge (all these people work in the industry too).

And some of them are so INSISTENT. I'm really shy and I have my own personal life but sometimes these dudes want to be ""friends"", which now I'm just increasingly suspicious of. And I'll have worked with them once years ago, had a coffee with once (also years ago) but they'll be blowing up my DMs and email in the current day being like ""why aren't we as close as we used to be? Did I offend you? What's wrong? Please talk to me!"" and I just don't want to see them. Like, we're not friends!!

But I also worry if it makes me a succubus-y LA slimy networker if I only want to hang out with industry people if they have work for me. But that's the truth. I already have friends and family. I don't wanna be besties. Is that bad?

I find this whole topic so embarrassing and upsetting I nearly made a throwaway. Probably should've. Anyway, just wondering if anyone has advice or commiseratory stories. ",3,1745912024.0,acting,5,1.0,False

* It gives them back **enriched** with diagrams, annotated visuals, and even GIF flashcards based on the text

Basically: same info you already had → just upgraded to be easier to **review**, **remember**, and **learn faster**.

**Why I’m building it:**

* I always found myself reformatting notes manually into mind maps, flashcards, diagrams — and it took forever
* I figured: why not automate it a little and save that energy for actual studying?

* Prototype alive (can parse PDFs and generate basic visual layouts)

## Why Upgrade to a Breville Bottomless Portafilter? Unveiling the Benefits

So, why should you consider upgrading to a breville bottomless portafilter? Beyond the sheer visual appeal, a bottomless portafilter offers a range of advantages for both improving your espresso and expanding your skillset. Here are the key benefits:

*   **Enhanced Visual Feedback:** This is the most immediate and arguably the most meaningful advantage. The absence of spouts allows you to observe the entire extraction process in real-time. You can instantly identify channeling (uneven extraction), spurting, and other inconsistencies that are hidden when using a standard spouted portafilter. This immediate feedback is invaluable for diagnosing issues and refining your technique. A breville bottomless portafilter shot quality relies heavily on identifying these issues.

*   **Diagnostic Powerhouse:** A bottomless portafilter acts like a diagnostic tool for your espresso.By observing the extraction, you can quickly pinpoint problems with your grind size, tamping pressure, or puck preparation. Are you experiencing channeling? It might be due to an uneven tamp, a grind that's too coarse, or coffee grounds clinging to the side of the basket. A breville bottomless portafilter channeling is much easier to identify which helps you correct the issue.

*   **Improved Extraction & Crema:** When used correctly, a breville bottomless portafilter can actually improve the quality of your espresso. By providing a more even and consistent extraction, you'll often notice a richer, more flavorful shot with better crema. This happens because you're actively addressing and correcting issues that would otherwise negatively impact the final result. the breville bottomless portafilter extraction becomes easier to dial in with practice.

*   **Higher Capacity & Easier Cleaning:** Many aftermarket breville bottomless portafilters are designed to accommodate larger doses of coffee compared to the stock baskets. This can allow you to experiment with different recipes and extraction ratios. Additionally, cleaning is often easier as there are no spouts to trap coffee residue.*   **Aesthetics and Satisfaction:** Let's be honest, watching that lovely, even flow of espresso from a bottomless portafilter is incredibly satisfying. It adds a new level of enjoyment to the home barista experience.and it looks awesome!

## Choosing the Right Breville Bottomless portafilter: Compatibility is Key

Before you rush out and buy the first breville bottomless portafilter you see, it's crucial to ensure compatibility with your specific Breville espresso machine. Breville uses different portafilter sizes across its range of machines, so selecting the correct size is paramount. You can usually find a breville spare parts portafilter if your machine needs one.

*   **54mm Portafilters:** These are typically found on Breville's entry-level and mid-range machines, including the Barista Express (BES870XL), Barista Pro, Bambino Plus, Infuser, and Duo-Temp Pro. If you own one of these machines, you'll need a breville 54mm bottomless portafilter.

*   **58mm Portafilters:** Breville's higher-end machines, notably the Dual Boiler (BES920XL and BES900XL) and Oracle Touch, use a larger 58mm portafilter. For these models, you'll need a breville 58mm bottomless portafilter.

*   **Finding the Right Fit:** If you're unsure which size you need, consult your machine's manual or Breville's website. You can also measure the diameter of your existing portafilter basket. Be careful to look for ""breville compatible bottomless portafilter.""

## Dialing In Your Espresso: Mastering the Art of the Bottomless Shot

Once you've acquired your breville bottomless portafilter, the real fun begins: dialing in your espresso. This involves adjusting various parameters to achieve the perfect balance of flavour, body, and crema. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Start with Fresh, High-Quality Coffee:** The quality of your coffee beans is paramount. Opt for freshly roasted, whole bean coffee from a reputable roaster.

2.  **Grind Size Adjustment:** Grind size is arguably the most critical factor. If the espresso flows too quickly (under-extraction), resulting in a sour or weak shot, you need to grind finer.If the espresso flows too slowly (over-extraction), resulting in a bitter or harsh shot, you need to grind coarser. Make small adjustments and observe the results.

3.  **Dosing and Distribution:** Precisely weigh your dose of coffee. A consistent dose is essential for consistent results. Use a WDT (Weiss Distribution Technique) tool or simply tap and level the coffee grounds in the basket to ensure even distribution. This is vital for breville bottomless portafilter puck prep.

4.  **Tamping Technique:** Apply consistent and even tamping pressure. Aim for around 30 pounds of pressure. A calibrated tamper can definitely help with this. An uneven tamp can led to channeling.

5.  **Observe the Extraction:** As the espresso begins to flow,watch closely for any signs of channeling or uneven extraction. Adjust your grind size, distribution, or tamping technique as needed.

6.  **Evaluate the Shot:** Taste the espresso and assess its flavor, body, and crema. Adjust your parameters accordingly until you achieve the desired result. It may take a few tries with a breville bottomless portafilter upgrade, but you will get there!

## Troubleshooting Common Issues with a Breville Bottomless Portafilter

even with the best equipment and technique, you may encounter some common issues when using a breville bottomless portafilter.Here's how to troubleshoot them:

*   **Channeling:** This is characterized by jets of espresso spurting out from specific areas of the basket, indicating uneven extraction. Causes include uneven tamping, inconsistent grind size, or uneven distribution. Solution: Refine your tamping technique, ensure consistent grind size, and use a WDT tool for even distribution.

*   **Spurting:** Similar to channeling, but frequently enough more violent and erratic. Causes include a grind that's too coarse, insufficient tamping pressure, or coffee grounds clinging to the side of the basket.Solution: Grind finer, apply more tamping pressure, and ensure the basket is clean before brewing.

*   **blonding:** This refers to the espresso flowing out clear or blonde towards the end of the extraction,indicating that you've extracted all the desirable compounds from the coffee. Solution: Stop the extraction before blonding occurs to avoid bitterness.

*   **No Crema:** Lack of crema can be due to stale beans, a grind that's too coarse, or insufficient pressure from your machine.Solution: Use fresh beans, grind finer, and ensure your machine is properly maintained.

We met on Hinge and we had a great conversation so after about a week we decided to meet up. 

For some background, I’ve never officially been in a relationship and I’ve never had sex or kissed a girl and I’m waiting until marriage for religious reasons, however, I have been on a number of dates but that’s only because it was difficult finding a good match using online dating and I’ve maybe only met 2-3 women I truly connected with but things just fizzled out. 

So I meet this girl and on our first date she wants me to pick her up at her house which I thought was interesting since we had never met or even FaceTimed. So I pick her up from her house and we just get coffee and talk at a park. We hit it off really well and we decided to walk around the park. She offered to hold my hand so we held hands while walking around. This wasn’t really weird but it just felt rushed since this was our very first meeting and we didn’t even talk much beforehand. Then we get back to my car and we talk some more. She then says she wants to kiss me and I told her no since we had just met and she was a little bummed but was okay with it. 

While we were walking she had mentioned that she was still friends with her ex and the red flags immediately went off. I had experienced this before when I was used as a Christmas rebound and she got back with her ex so I had seen this whole, “I’m still friends with my ex” thing before and it didn’t end well. 

So I just stayed silent and she said that they had dated for 3 years and lived together for about a year and a half. I asked her how long it had been since they broke up and she said roughly 2-3 years. 

I figured this was enough time since the girl that used me as a rebound only had a 2-3 month break before we went out so 2-3 years seemed like enough time to move on emotionally. So we continue going out and getting to know each other. Another odd note to add was that on that first date, when I was driving her home, she said, “not to be weird, but I could see us marrying each other”. I didn’t know what to say but I played it off and just acted normal. 

She’s really into physical touch so on our second date, she asked if we could cuddle. I thought that was really weird but I had never cuddled anyone before so I wasn’t sure what to expect. We cuddled in her room for a while and then she sits up and tells me that she “really wants to have sex with me”. I told her no and reminded her that I was waiting until marriage and she said she was okay with that. 

Then we go on a few more dates and there was some red flags sprinkled in. For example, she called me by her ex’s name on accident and she’ll constantly talk about their friendship. Then she’ll say odd stuff like how she’ll think about me while masturbating and that she hates “having to wait”. I told her that we might not be a good fit if she doesn’t want to wait but she said she likes me a ton and “wouldn’t wait for just anyone but would do it for me”. Then she bought me roses and snacks and would drive me around everywhere and buy my food even though I’d insist on buying everything.

So now we’re about 6 dates in and I’m not sure how to feel. There were other non relationship red flags like her gaslighting me when she said that my religion was evil (I’m Catholic) but then when I brought it up, she told me, “I never said that, where and when did I say that”. And she said it multiple times. 

Then just yesterday she was screen sharing on FaceTime and I see that there’s a lot of pictures of her and her ex that were dated just a few months ago and it looked like they were out at a really nice dinner (dress, collard shirt, etc.) and it was just the two of them. So I confronted her and said, “I thought you said you both are just friends and broke up a few years ago…that definitely didn’t look like a friendship kind of dinner so are you both still talking?”. She then admitted that they did break up a few years ago but had a “friends with benefits” thing up until a few months ago but clearly there was something more going on if they were going to nice dinners and all that together still even after breaking up and despite being in a “friends with benefits” situation. 

I knew something was up when she came on so strong and my heart sank after she said that. She swears up and down that it was “meaningless sex” and “they just used each other when they needed relief” but I’m just really not sure how to feel. I’m in no place to tell her that she isn’t ready to date because everyone is different but I’ve seen this pattern before and it always ends bad. 

She’s an amazing woman and we click on so many levels that I’ve never clicked with anyone on before but the love bombing, gas lighting, and the white lies seem to be some red flags I can’t ignore. 

I just need some advice. I really don’t want to let her go since we connect so well but right now I have my love blinders on and need a third party perspective. Part of me sees it and part of me wants to ignore it. So if anyone has any input, please share it because my mind is at a standstill and I think part of that is because she was with me throughout my entire cancer diagnosis phase so I feel a special attachment to her. 

Edit: I also forgot to add that she still talks to her ex frequently. So I found out that she was telling him about our dates, she stalked my social media accounts and found out I owned a business and told him about it, and she said he wants to go on a trip together…just the three of us.

Have you ever had one of those mornings where you just feel like you’re already losing the day before it even starts? 🙄 We've all been there! The alarm goes off, you hit snooze, and suddenly you’re scrambling like a headless chicken. But what if I told you that one tiny tweak could transform your entire day? Sounds like magic, right? Well, it kinda is!

**Let’s talk about the power of micro-habits.** Just a small change can lead to BIG results! Here are a few tweaks I've tried that made a world of difference for me:

1. **Drink Water First Thing** 💧  
   - Instead of reaching for that cup of coffee immediately (I know, I know, it’s a sacred ritual!), I started downing a glass of water. It’s like giving my body a wake-up call that says, “Hey, we made it to another day!”

2. **5-Minute Stretching** 🧘‍♂️  
   - Instead of scrolling through social media, I set my timer for 5 minutes and do some basic stretches. Let me tell you, it feels amazing to loosen up those limbs and get the blood flowing. 

3. **No Phone Zone for 30 Minutes** 🚫📱  
   - Locking the phone up and giving myself 30 minutes of tech-free time has been a game-changer. I read, journal, or just sit in silence. It’s incredible how much clarity can come from a little quiet time!

4. **Plan One “Joy” Activity** 🌈  
   - Every morning, I try to add something that sparks joy. Whether it’s jamming to my favorite playlist or curling up with a book for 10 minutes, I set the tone for the day. It’s the little things that brighten our mornings!

5. **Gratitude Lists** 🙏  
   - Spending a few minutes jotting down what I’m thankful for has shifted my perspective. It’s hard to feel down when you’re focusing on the good stuff!

I know… some of these might sound simple, but it’s all about finding what works for YOU! We often overlook the little things, but those tiny tweaks can set the tone for an entire day. Who knew that changing how we wake up could result in us actually, you know, enjoying our mornings? 🤯

So, what’s your tiny tweak? Do you have a little ritual that’s made a big impact? Let’s share our secrets and build a morning routine that makes us excited to rise with the sun! 🌅",1,1745911580.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1kai36y,https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1kai36y/veganism_dont_cause_health_issues_the_only_truth/,Veganism DON'T cause health issues - The only truth,"Many people say ""i was vegan and i got health issues"" etc. But, it is the truth? What is missing from them thought?

The truth is that veganism itself don't cause anything, bad or good. If you get health issues the problem your own diet. Be vegan don't mean that you should eat 3 kg of estrogenic soy every day (this is not a rule only for men: excess estrogen and xenoestrogen are harmful and inflamatory for women too - progesterone is the real female hormone, estrogen are useful on some things but still both men and women need balanced estrogen). Be vegan don't mean that you should eat a lot of hard to digest things like green vegetables (i am not against vegetables but you should eat them in moderate amounts, unlike fruits).

The real problem is that most people just eat the wrong foods. Non-vegans have many health issues too, for the same reason, but is easier to blame veganism for anything.

I am a young man, vegan since my 13. Most guys i know (non-vegans) have testosterone levels around 300 - 600, and i have 1264. My bodyfat is low even with 4000 calories per day because of my metabolism. Don't missunderstand it, i don't mean i am better than others. I just mean that the right diet is possible, cheap and easier than you think: I eat some dates and drink a protein shake with orange juice before job, i only drink coffee after eating, my next meal is rice or backed potato with cocconut oil (good fats) and maybe some beans for protein. I enjoy lots of fruits also. My favorite food is rice with white button mushroom, cooked with garcil in cocconut oil. Maybe this diet looks boring if you are addicted to pizza and ultra processed food, but the vitality and energy levels it can give you is so incredible that you will never want again eat PUFAs and estrogenic things after try this diet. You don't need to cut off all foods you like: Just avoid PUFAs/seed oil, soy, and ultra processed foods, and you have almost fix your diet. No need to spend thousands per month for ""superfoods"" or waste many hours per day cooking.

Some supplements are very benefical. Not only for vegans but also for non-vegans, don't think that if you eat meat you get anything you need, most meats nowdays on the market are low quality (plants too, of course, but at least plants have not feelings, and they not scream). D3+K2, zinc, and magnesium (glycinate or malate) are the 3 top. I also take creatine and taurine, amazing feeling.

Anyway, maybe you will like to try the things i mentiont, maybe you not, but don't blame veganism if you get health problems. And note, when someone says ""i got back my health, i feel better after starts eating meat again"", maybe it's just placebo, especially if all bad habits remain the same.",0,1745911334.0,exvegans,9,0.14,False

I'm so autistic and so insanely honest. I had no idea.,"It’s been awhile since I’ve written anything, which is somewhat of a surprise seeing as there were many noteworthy happenings in this last week. Fortunately, or not (depending on the way you look at it), since I am writing this now it means that I can cut out a lot of the less important things (such as the mandatory dormitory meetings, the bullshit surrounding which I need not delve into). This also means that I have had some time to think about things, such as the highly disturbing dream that I had. For fear of causing myself harm in some way or another at a future point in time, I am loathe to recount the events of said dream as they were of a rather licentious nature and, as such, not exactly something I would like other people reading about.

I have had substantial difficulty coming to terms with living away from SLC and with the nature of myself. On Saturday, I was coaxed out of my room for a trip out to Ephraim canyon nearing midnight. Most of the kids who went (packing into three separate cars) were Mormons of the ‘my religion is my life’ type—of course, that observation could be off somewhat (there were probably a couple not-so-hardcore types there). At this point, I had found no friends whatsoever to identify with and found myself sitting alone and enjoying the view for the most part. The way the hills were still visible under the moonlight rolling towards the city blinking in the distance was calming.

Yesterday, I found myself quite elated to discover that my fellow roommates down the hall were more normal—you know, into drinking, smoking, sex, etc. After a lunch comprised of tortilla chips, salsa and the better part of a jug of water, we headed back to the dorms to hang out for a bit. Of course, the casual topics of sex, drugs and anime arose during this time. Slowly, but surely, the realization that my new friends were about as interesting and predictable as the Mormons I had so strived to move away from set in—these people were little different from the ones I have known for years, at least on the surface, and I don’t think I want to get my hopes up. Feeling rather unfulfilled I receded to my room for some geometry wars and MSN chatting. Before I go on, let me explain a bit about how I look at Casey…

Here’s hoping I can stay honest for this part. I’m not even sure that’s possible, considering how I feel, but you have my word that I am going to try my best. I guess, in case I never get another chance, I should probably give a rundown of how I met her and what led me to the point I found myself last night. Casey and I originally met over [craigslist.com](http://craigslist.com) during my search for a new apartment and hers for a roommate. Judging from the time period during which I needed a new stopping off point, that would place our initial meeting sometime in late May/early June.

We had talked on MySpace before I met her and I was glad to see that she was actually pretty cute, though not immediately attractive (she did have that weird indie-appeal, and while I wasn’t sure whether it was accidental or not at the time, I was still glad to see it). I think it goes without saying that I have been in a state of emotional turmoil since about Senior year of High school, which is important to this situation because all of my relationships before Casey have been based on a gut attraction thanks to the girl being pretty or, in the cases of both Whitney and Anastasia, thanks to the girl paying attention to me when I didn’t realize I had done anything to deserve it (by being physically attractive, I guess). Then again, I suppose no one would really classify anything I’ve ever been involved in as a relationship, so maybe these are merely girls I’ve had some sort of connection with, physical or otherwise. It does help me regain perspective about things when I doubt myself, which is good.

Incredibly, the two girls I remember the most were the ones I possibly talked to the least—I am, of course, talking about Danni and Abbey. I definitely wasn’t good enough for Abbey at the time, and I’m thankful I didn’t get her number as it would have been terrible to try take my nervous, nearing-the-end-of-high school perception of relationships into a situation with her as she certainly deserved much better (and by that I mean that she did nothing to earn the burden of my presence).

By the time I met Danni though, I was working for circuit city, had graduated from high school and was bored out of my mind with money to burn, a situation that found me planted in a chair at Sugarhouse coffee nearly every night. I remember seeing her setting up a lamp in the crowded indoor seating area of the coffee house in preparation for studying; she was wearing a shirt and necklace that was strikingly similar to an outfit that Anastasia used to wear. As always, I didn’t have my glasses on and found myself intrigued by the slim, brunette blob near the window.

I sat at a table near her and pretended to be immersed in… something. Then again, maybe I honestly was reading for once, it didn’t happen very often because I was so sick with a desire to finally meet somebody and pull myself out of this hole, but I remember being distracted from whatever it was that I was doing by her. We ended up talking about the U of U and good courses to take. She and I were immediately interested in each other, I knew because of the way we looked at each other’s eyes. It’s a very rare sensation and I do yearn for it dearly.

Danni was at Sugarhouse Coffee more than I was, and I started looking forward to getting off work so I could talk with her and, on occasion, watch her perform poetry which she had written and related with quick words and fiery eyes. Beyond that, when it was just her and me talking, I loved how she seemed to have a terrible case of ADD because she did things like carry around farm animals in her purse (which she photographed with her phone on top of a picture of Stephen Hawking’s wheelchair hurtling through space on the cover of my friend’s copy of *A Brief History of Time* which I was borrowing) and seemed to move from one topic to another with amazing rapidity. Danni also got me into cigarettes, but I never became addicted.

I was never able to work up the courage to ask Danni out, despite the fact that it was obvious that she liked me at least enough to go out with me once (usually, the kind of hugs that she kept giving me on my birthday are a pretty good indication of that). Later, my friend Chris told me that she was asking him about me and was certainly interested in me. He didn’t tell me earlier because I had to “learn on my own.” Damn it if Chris wasn’t right (I’m still not there yet). A couple of days later, I moved to Hawaii to live with my mom.

I guess I was going to talk about Casey, then, and the conversation we had. Right now, it strikes me as being strangely unimportant, but I guess I will recount it and my feelings for her all the same. Casey and I started hanging out after she found out her friend did want to be her roommate after all and had to turn me down after we agreed that I would be moving in, which was definitely a life-changing decision for me (she was very apologetic). If I had stayed with her, I never would have come to Snow college, probably wouldn’t have worked out my relationship with my parents and might be somewhere else entirely right now, I really don’t know, but it’s fun to think about.

After coffee one night, during which we had a conversation that I quite enjoyed, my life went on pretty much as it had been and, for the first time, I didn’t find myself suddenly enamored with this new female friend of mine, a sign of maturity I think. Eventually, we got around to having drinks together (it was originally supposed to be a group thing, but that didn’t work out). Actually, she had a spot of Vodka and then we both got baked. I was taking care of my friend Marco at the time (to the extent that the term ‘taking care of’ can be applied to going over to house and having him get me food and things while I played Resident Evil 4) and ended up driving back to his house, still a little toasty. For the first time, I actually kind of enjoyed being high, though not to the extent I would the next time I went to her house (thanks to the quantity of weed I smoked, I was rather paranoid and my memory has a lot of ‘black spots’).

Finally, the last time I went to her house I brought some Sky vodka with me and we had a bit to drink and then got high again. It was at this time that I started to feel like I didn’t want to leave Salt Lake anymore. I think this pretty much gets us back to where my last journals started, but to summarize, I went a little bit crazy about the whole thing until finally, when I was completely honest about my feelings with her and she related back that she didn’t think I was such a bad guy myself, I was able to get myself under control again.

Sadly, when I got to Ephraim and found that I hated not having my friends here, I kept finding myself returning to thoughts about her. It wasn’t the most pleasant situation to be in and I found refuge in the idea of love, however distant the possibility of it was. I still believe in love, which probably has something to do with why that conversation I have referenced a few times left a numbingly bitter taste in my mouth. So what was that conversation? Well, after having had a couple of chances to talk with Casey—one of which I told her I was drunk during even though I had only had a shot of Vodka because I wanted so badly to feel home again, to feel like I hadn’t lost that connection completely—during most of which I complained in excess about my roommates, I finally got around to finding myself a crowd I thought I liked at first.

As I realize now, I wanted her approval so much that I was doing stuff so I would have a chance to talk with her and actually have something to say (like how I went and hung out with the momos), so of course I told her that I had a bunch of new friends that I was happy with and also related that one of them wanted to take my virginity (though I used the fun euphemism ‘v-card’ in its place). I wondered why she didn’t reply for awhile and so I downloaded this album that she had recommended to me (the soundtrack to Once) so that I would, again, have something to talk about. I liked a couple of the songs on the album quite a bit, but I didn’t really pay attention to that, all I cared about was whether or not she was going to say anything.

Ironically, this was after I had told myself repeatedly that I had to *stop worrying about what other people think of me*. Part of me seemed to think I had succeeded, but I was clearly wrong. Casey eventually replied, telling me at first to not let these people change me (after inquiring about whether or not I had been, uh, *deflowered* by this point in time), and then saying (after I hastily replied that I had been around these types before and knew what was up) that I should go have sex so I could have some experience for when I finally found the right girl.

I hated that response with pretty much everything I could feel. Hated it so much that I kind of shut down for the night. Had I been wrong all this time? Did nobody care about that sort of thing anymore? Should I finally just give in? These questions all flitted through my mind throughout the dark and I was distressed. But then I remembered that I really do like myself, and I’m glad I do things the way that I do. I didn’t want sex, I like being how I am. I like the fact that I can wait. Maybe I couldn’t before and the only reason I didn’t have sex with Anastasia and Whitney was because I didn’t know how to go about it. (Though I like to think that subconsciously I avoided it. Which, hell, may be true—who else responds to messages about how a girl wants to have sex with them by sitting in their car and slamming their head on the steering wheel with the girl looking on unsatisfied? Who else tells a girl, between hard making out and ass grabbing—I wasn’t the one doing that either, thanks to my personal standards and aforementioned trouble with closeness—that they are still a virgin and have never gone past ‘first base’ before? Which, again, was pretty much by choice—though I did have some incentive because she told me I was a great kisser. I couldn’t make myself feel up a girl, that’s just not me.)

I’m not really sure what else there is to say. Do I still like Casey? Yeah, it’s kind of hard to make that sort of feeling go away, there isn’t really a switch I can flip and stop thinking about her. Maybe it would help if I felt like she understood me, and maybe even wanted to help me wrap my head around things (I know, that’s more than I should ever hope for from anybody), because at least then I wouldn’t feel this hurt. It’s never a good feeling to have people think you are someone that you aren’t, someone you never wanted to be. I got the feeling that a part of her, no matter how small, wishes that she didn’t have that sexual experience that she does, I’m not sure why exactly (maybe the strangely sisterly ‘don’t let them change you’ and ‘hold onto your v-card’ advice being followed by ‘copy it and give it out,’ which I interpreted to mean ‘hone your sexual chops.’ Any time I see someone switch views so quickly I find to be a cause for interest, and while there is the possibility that she was merely irked with me—understandable—it seems that there is more to it than that), but at least understanding her words differently has given me some insight into how she is.

At least I think so, and it would make sense too that there is a part of her that has done things that she doesn’t remember fondly (we all have that) or maybe a part that is being repressed. Either that or she was born to love weed or something (I endorse drugs myself, but it’s usually a sign of past trouble when someone is that heavy into being in an altered state as often as possible). I don’t know if what I said is accurate at all, though I hope for the best. Either way, I want to pay more attention to other people’s thoughts, I find myself caught up in myself too easily. I become overly excited when the prospect that I have found someone, finally, exists. I don’t want to screw up again, it’s too hard to go through this that many times.

But what part of all of this is chance? Is fate a realistic concept? I know that I am only attracted to certain girls, and I will stand by that, regardless of social pressures to think differently. Physically, I mostly find myself attracted to thin, white girls (often quite pale), with dark—usually brown—hair. Is this just a way of helping me filter out the girls that I wouldn’t like or is it merely aesthetic in nature, having nothing to do with the pursuit of meaning? I couldn’t say, but I know that beyond that I do quite like girls who I can be comfortable with (at least as comfortable as I can be. Danni and Casey were both good examples of the borderline comfort that I felt because I couldn’t avoid the inevitable social giddiness that seems to accompany me whenever I am with that kind of girl). I also love it when I can *talk* to a girl. That’s something that can be difficult for me, but it’s fun when people use just as many ‘big words’ as I do for the hell of it (language is fun, damn it) or at least don’t say ‘wow, you use a lot of big words.’ At least that way I don’t feel like a pretentious dick, and we’re having fun. I also like girls who can talk a lot when I can’t think of anything to say. People are interesting, at least when they aren’t on about themselves, a lesson I would certainly do well to learn. The last thing, and this is really important, is that I’d love a girl who is awkward like me.

I know that if I just hold on, I’ll meet the right girl. I don’t mean ‘the one’ or whatever hallmark crap people are into these days, but I mean someone that I will be happy to be spending my time with while I have that time, regardless of how things end.

It’s those “rules” you’ve made for yourself that are no negotiation. The little things that no matter how stressed or busy one is, you keep these things going. It doesn’t matter if you have a presentation, proposal, discussion, paper, deadline etc coming up you’re doing the thing. 

Theirs is that they always ride their bike to the ice cream shop down the road from their apartment on Fridays. I talked with another who sets out specifically 2 hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to play video games. Another who goes to every poetry event Tuesdays at a local coffee shop. Then there’s another in our cohort who watches two tv episodes a night of a show they’re watching. 

Mine is that I don’t work while I’m eating. Sometimes it goes as far as I don’t even use technology while I’m eating. Those are the few mental breaks I get and I’ll postpone eating to a moment when I know I won’t have to get work done. After I started doing that my first year, I’ve noticed a big difference. It forces me to step away. Even if I’m snacking, I put the same rule into play.

| New Mid-Race Goal: No walking/stopping (Yes)
| Final Time: 3:19:55

Training background:
Followed a structured training plan with mid-to-high mileage. Hit a recent 30k at 4:16/km pace feeling easy and raced a PB half a month ago.

Race goals:

A-goal: Sub-3

B-goal: Stay consistent, no walking or stopping

C-goal: Finish proud

Only B goal was achieved in the end.


Pre-race & nutrition:
Carb loaded for a few days before. No caffeine for a week beforehand.
Race morning: bagel with PB&J, coffee, three biscoff cookies. Half a Maurten Caff 100 drink (diluted), beetroot shot ~90 mins before start. Took paracetamol, Imodium, and Gravol (usual routine) an hour before.
30 min before: two beta alanine tablets.
15 min before: Maurten Caff 100 gel.

Pre-race chaos:
I was in the 9:10 wave. We weren’t allowed to use the toilets once we were in our corral, which we had to be in an hour before the start. Pretty much all the men were peeing in the bushes right at the start area. I was one of the very few women there, so I asked the race staff if I could quickly use the porta-loos (which were RIGHT there and empty), but they told me they were for elites only and I'd have to ""go on course."" Not ideal. Bad omen perhaps. 

During race:
Plan was to take Maurten 160 every 45 min or so, two SaltStick caps total, plus water at aid stations.

Temps started mild but it was heating up fast — finished around 20°C (~68°F). I hadn't trained in anything that warm lately.

Another mental curveball: course only had mile markers, not km. I usually pace off kilometers, so I kept having to do mental math mid-race. Threw me off a little mentally in the second half when I desperately wanted to be done.

Race execution:

Felt amazing through about 19km (~4:10–4:13/km).
Started to feel a little warm but still manageable.
By 25km, pace drifted to 4:20s/km.
At 32km, the wheels came ALL the way off: retching, dizzy, couldn't push, and survival mode began.
Pace dropped to ~5:30/km. Wanted to DNF but forced myself to keep running (no walking).
From 32km to finish, it was pure survival.
Finish line:
After crossing, I immediately felt super wobbly, got my medal then collapsed into the fence  and vomited up a huge amount of orange liquid (full of Maurtens chunks!). A guy asked if I wanted a medic and I almost said no because I felt better for vomiting. The medic came to me and I vomited even more and through my nose. Suddenly started shivering uncontrollably, my hands went numb, my legs cramped, and my lips turned blue. Medic put on an oxygen mask and said I was going into shock. Oxygen was at 93% even with the oxygen mask. I was told not to drink, had ice packs in my armpits, and legs elevated. Spent about an hour recovering before I could leave - right at the finish line so I’m sure some of you probably saw me! 

And then to top it all off - c’mon, no goodie bags??? Not even a banana!
I was hoping for something a little better after that level of suffering.

Take it from me. Adjust your goals when it’s hot out, folks!

That dimly lit, worn-in atmosphere—the kind that lets you sink into a seat and forget the world—is gone. Now? It’s all polished concrete, sanitized spaces, and furniture designed for discomfort. Coffee shops used to be places with history in their walls, places that didn’t feel like pop-up installations in some influencer’s curated aesthetic.

Once, they were grungy, lived-in refuges. The sort of place where some bearded existentialist could change your perspective over a cup of coffee so dark it punched you in the throat. A place where people actually talked—no earbuds, no curated playlists drowning out conversation.  

But now? Where the hell did that go?

The other day, I needed a place—just a decent cup of Joe and somewhere to let my thoughts settle. Google Maps, my misguided sidekick, pointed me toward some five-star mirage. Thought, maybe this one?

I arrive. What do I find? 
Windows stretching from floor to ceiling like some soulless startup office. Blank walls begging you not to linger. Stools designed for maximum discomfort. And worst of all—not a single person with a spark of individuality. Just ,kids chasing sugar highs, ordering drinks so loaded with syrup they probably need insulin before they finish sipping.  

Jesus.  

I walked out. Even Starbucks once used to have charm, now it’s just another factory line.  

Tried again. Checked the photos this time—black walls, a chalkboard menu with five or six items, old-school touches that made me think, Alright. Maybe this one.

Nope.  

The walls? Repainted. The menu? Fifty choices drowning in sugar, half of them barely qualifying as coffee. Turns out those photos were seven damn years old.

<div>### Elevate Your Space with Fashion-Inspired Bedroom Decor

Transforming a bedroom into a stylish sanctuary draws heavily from the world of fashion. Fashion-inspired bedroom decor brings the latest runway trends, bold patterns, and luxe textures directly into your personal space. Integrating elements like chic textiles, statement wall art, and designer-inspired accessories can create an environment that feels both glamorous and inviting.

### Key Elements to Incorporate for a Fashion-Forward Bedroom

- **Bold Patterns and Prints:** Draw inspiration from iconic fashion prints such as animal patterns, florals, or geometric shapes to liven up bedding, curtains, or accent pillows.
- **Luxurious Textures:** Incorporate velvet throws, silk cushions, or faux fur rugs to add sophistication and tactile interest.
- **Statement Lighting:** Choose fixtures that double as art pieces—think oversized chandeliers or sculptural bedside lamps.
- **Color Palette:** Utilize trending fashion colors like deep emerald, classic black and white, or blush pink to create a cohesive style-driven atmosphere.
 
### Stylish Accessories Inspired by Fashion

Accessories play a crucial role in achieving a fashion-inspired bedroom decor. Consider fashion magazines displayed as coffee table books, designer-inspired mirrors, or jewelry stands doubling as decorative accents. Incorporating stylish storage solutions that resemble runway clutches or handbags can also enhance the room's theme while maintaining functionality.

1kahlqg,https://i.redd.it/vncqgxbj0qxe1.png,How Does Bitcoin Work?,"Bitcoin has been making headlines for years — as an investment, a technological innovation, and even a tool for financial freedom. But **what is Bitcoin**, and **how does it actually work**?

Whether you're curious, cautious, or crypto-curious, this quick guide will help you understand the basics of how Bitcoin functions and how you can start using it — even for everyday purchases.

# 🔗 What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a **digital currency** that allows people to send and receive money over the internet without going through a bank. It was invented in 2009 by a mysterious figure (or group) named **Satoshi Nakamoto**.

Unlike traditional currencies like dollars or euros, Bitcoin is **decentralized** — meaning no government or bank controls it. Instead, it runs on a network of computers around the world.

# 📚 1. The Blockchain: Bitcoin’s Public Ledger

All Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public file called the **blockchain**.

Think of it as a **digital ledger** that's shared across thousands of computers. When someone sends Bitcoin, the transaction is grouped with others into a “block.” That block is then added to the chain in a way that **can’t be altered**, making Bitcoin extremely secure and transparent.

# 🔐 2. Wallets and Keys: How You Store and Send Bitcoin

To use Bitcoin, you need a **digital wallet**. It comes with:

* A **public address** (like an email address) that others use to send you Bitcoin.
* A **private key** (like your password) that you use to sign and approve transactions.

⚠️ Important: Never share your private key. It's the only way to access your Bitcoin.

# ⛏️ 3. Mining: How New Bitcoins Are Created

New Bitcoins are created through a process called **mining**. Miners are computers that solve complex puzzles to validate transactions.

When they solve a puzzle, they add a new block to the blockchain and are rewarded with new bitcoins. This process is called **proof of work** and helps keep the network honest and secure.

# 🛡️ 4. Security Through Decentralization

Bitcoin isn’t stored in one place. Instead, it's distributed across thousands of computers (called **nodes**).

This makes it:

* **Hard to hack**
* **Resistant to censorship**
* **Always available** — 24/7, worldwide

And since anyone can see the blockchain, transactions are transparent — but your identity remains private unless you reveal it.

# 💳 5. Buy Bitcoin the Easy Way with [Spendo.com](https://spendo.com/)

Want to own some Bitcoin without the tech headaches? You can **buy Bitcoin easily** using [**Spendo.com**](https://spendo.com/).

* Simple signup and user-friendly interface
* Purchase Bitcoin using a debit card or bank transfer
* Store it securely in your Spendo wallet

But here’s the game-changer:  
💥 **You can link your Bitcoin wallet to a Spendo debit card** — and use it to **spend your crypto for everyday purchases**. Whether it's coffee, groceries, or even online shopping, Bitcoin becomes as easy to use as cash.

# 🌍 Why Bitcoin Matters

Bitcoin isn’t just digital money. It represents a new way to:

* Store value
* Transact globally
* Bypass outdated, expensive banking systems

With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, it’s also being seen by many as a **hedge against inflation** — like digital gold.

# ✅ Final Thoughts

Bitcoin works because of a powerful combination of **cryptography, decentralization, and transparency**. It lets anyone, anywhere, send value without relying on a middleman.

And now, with tools like [Spendo.com](https://spendo.com/), you can buy Bitcoin and **actually use it** — seamlessly, securely, and with total control.

**AAA: Caden Dana, Kenyon Yovan, Gustavo Campero**

Not too much needs to be said about Dana.  He struggled in spring training, but he's shown why he's one of our two best prospects, including a gem on 4/17, when he pitched 7 scoreless innings. If any of our starting rotation go down or struggle, his name will be heavily considered (alongside Detmers and Silseth), though I'm hoping he gets more time to hone his craft so he can spend a long time as a long-term mid-rotation guy for us.

Yovan was a two-way guy who converted into full-time pitching. It took him a year to shed batting responsibilities and though he's struggled initially in new surroundings for the last couple years, he seems to be finding his stride. Though we have a few other bridge relievers like Michael Darrell-Hicks and Hector Neris, he will eventually get a look if he continues pitching like this. He might have to wait his turn behind some of our other fast risers, but our bullpen gets lots of movement.

Campero had his big league cup of coffee last season. He wasn't good, but he also wasn't disastrously bad, and he's at least making as good of an argument as he can to come back up. He has historically had pretty good K% and BB%. Seeing as we seem to be allergic to walking and addicted to striking out, he could make sense as the first guy up if we have an outfield injury. Also being on the 40-man already would make that more convenient. Lugo would be the main other corner outfielder considered, but he's probably not ready yet.

**AA: George Klassen, Denzer Guzman, Kelvin Caceres, Samy Natera Jr., Jose Fermin**

Klassen's run prevention hasn't been elite, but his 12.6 K/9 with a 2.2 BB/9 is insane for a guy who had some control issues with us in 2024. Huge stuff and he really could use another year, but given our predilection for bringing guys up quickly, I think we'll definitely see him in September.

Denzer Guzman has been a bit overshadowed by the 8th pick CMo (who has picked it up after a slow start) and the 19 year old Rada. He wasn't super amazing last season, but considering the circumstances (played only 19 games in A+ and then got moved into AA for the rest at the age of 20), he acquitted himself fine at a premium defensive position. This season, he's suddenly turned up the power (in a small sample size), hitting 4 HRs in 77 PAs. I don't expect that to continue, but his batting average climbed 60 points from last year's AA stint. If he can settle in as an above average bat at AA, that's a huge win. His Rule 5 eligibility comes up this winter, so we'll almost definitely have to add him to our 40-man roster at this rate.

Caceres was briefly on our active roster, but he went down with a right lat injury that sidelined him long-term. After getting DFA'd and ending up back in our system, he's working his way back up through AA. Seems like he still has issues with command, but if he can keep blowing people away, it might not matter.

Holy crap, lefty reliever Samy Natera Jr.: 9.1 IP, 19.3 K/9 for 1.18 FIP. He converted to the bullpen last season, and between 2024 and 2025, he's up to 24.1 IP (elbow sprain in 2024) and he's given up a grand total of 3 runs (2 earned) while racking up 44 K's. Dude is unreal. Despite the low innings counts, he picked up some hype during Arizona Fall League and it seems like he's picking up where he left off.

If we hadn't called him up already, Fermin would be easily considered to be here too. We only acquired him in 2023 (surprisingly old for an international prospect), but he has done nothing but impress. In AA this season, he launched to a 8 IP, 15 K's for a 16.9 K/9 and a measly 1.1 BB/9 for a -0.16 FIP (yes that's negative). That's following up a very respectable 2024 mostly spent in A+ where he ended with 15 K/9 in 33.2 IP. When a guy's K%-BB% is 30.7%, he's in the wrong league.

**A+: Ryan Nicholson**

Our 10th round pick in 2024 is a bit old for A+ (24yo), but that's more so because first base at AA and AAA are kind of crowded right now (AAA with Kavadas/Noda; AA with Sam Brown/DiChiara). Nicholson played a handful of games in A after last year's draft and was pretty solid (143 wRC+). This season, we moved him up to A+ AND he's absolutely on fire (over .500 OBP, 219 wRC+, walks more than he strikes out). I think he'll get bumped up to AA pretty soon; it's just a matter of what we do with the other guys in his path. Brown has been decent this season, but DiChiara has had a Trout-esque statline (.146 BA, .174 BABIP, and still somehow over 100 wRC+). There's room for a 1B and a DH, but 2x 1B with a 1B/DH might be tough to justify. Nicholson's almost certainly leapfrogged the older Matt Coutney (also a 10th round pick himself), but we'll see if he can keep it up in AA when the time comes.

**A: Raudi Rodriguez**

We gave Rodriguez $100k to come out of high school and stuck him in the ACL for his first looks at pro ball. He wasn't great then and his current stats are likely buoyed by his .480 BABIP, but it's hard to ignore his 12% BB% and 7 (yes, 7!) triples in 83 plate appearances. 19 games and he already has 15 runs scored and 22 RBIs.",2,1745908666.0,angelsbaseball,2,0.67,False
1kahgxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1kahgxk/internet_contingency_planning_in_the_cities_of/,Internet contingency planning in the cities of the Philippines,"Planning my first trip, and since the Philippines doesn’t have the best reputation when it comes to internet (and electricity), I’m trying to reduce the odds of being without connectivity by performing some contingency planning.

Specifically, I’ll limit my stays to Manila, Cebu City, Davao City, and Iloilo City. I will not be visiting any remote tropical islands, as I don’t expect those areas to have reliable internet based on mixed reviews.

**Here’s what I’ve already done:**

* Messaged all the hosts to provide me with speed tests of their accommodations (while connected to servers in Europe during the test, so I can also assess ping times).
* Checked the nPerf 5G coverage in the areas I’ll be staying, so I can switch to hotspotting if issues arise.
* Created a Google Maps list of coworking spaces (I need them to be open after 6 PM due to my timezone difference with Europe).
* Compiled a list of coffee shops that seem suitable for working while hotspotting (focusing on larger, quieter venues that aren’t too cramped or noisy).

**Where I’ll be staying:**

* **Manila:** Makati/BGC — I don’t expect issues here.
* **Cebu City:** IT Park — I expect good connectivity here as well, especially with a Regus coworking space nearby.
* **Davao City:** Within the Poblacion District — nPerf shows decent 5G coverage, though frequent brownouts are reported by Davao Light (within Davao as a whole, didn't look deeper if it also happens in this district).
* **Iloilo City:** Near Iloilo Business Park — there’s a nearby Regus coworking space, but frequent brownouts are reportedly announced within Iloilo City by MORE Power.

**Remaining doubts/questions:**

1. Is it common for condominium complexes to have backup power generators in case brownouts occur?
2. Will mobile hotspotting still work during brownouts? Do nearby 5G antennas in the Philippines typically have dedicated backup generators?
3. I’ve heard that you can’t solely rely on 5G hotspotting in the Philippines like you can in Thailand or Vietnam, because even with full reception, the backhaul network sometimes can’t handle the traffic. How true is this in practice (in the cities mentioned)?
4. Do coworking spaces typically stay open past 6 PM? Many listings suggest they do, but it’s hard to be certain, as these details often aren’t reliably maintained in Asia.
5. What have your experiences been working from these cities in the Philippines? Am I overthinking this?

Planning a trip to the Philippines has definitely been harder than any other place I've been to so far. Hoping to collect your valuable insights, to make better informed decisions!

Sa dami ng pinagdaanan naming dalawa, akala ko alam na namin ang limitasyon at lalim ng pagkakaibigan namin. Kaya’t hindi ko inakalang si May ang magiging dahilan kung bakit kami magkakalamat.

Si May ay officemate ko. Sa simula, wala namang espesyal. Kaibigan, kakwentuhan, kabiruan. Hindi ko siya tinignan nang higit pa roon. Pero si Ken, mukhang agad na nahulog. Tinanong niya ako kung single si May, at bilang kaibigan, ginawa ko ang alam kong tama—tinulungan ko siya. Pinayuhan ko kung paano niya kakausapin si May. Lahat ng suporta na kaya kong ibigay, ibinigay ko.

Pero hindi naging sila. Hindi naging mutual. Sinabi ni May na hindi niya kayang gawing boyfriend si Ken. Inakala ko na okay na kay Ken iyon—sinabi naman niyang tanggap niya at move on na siya.

Nagpatuloy ang buhay. Nagkita pa rin kami ni May paminsan-minsan—coffee after work, o night out kasama ang ibang officemates. Hindi ko sinasabi kay Ken ang mga iyon. Hindi dahil may tinatago ako, kundi dahil ayokong magmukhang may malisya. Ayokong bigyan siya ng dahilan para mag-isip, lalo na’t wala naman akong nararamdaman para kay May. Sa akin, malinaw: magkaibigan lang kami.

Nang magplano ako ng trip sa Bacolod, una kong tinanong si Ken kung gusto niyang sumama. Sayang, sabi niya, hindi siya pwede. May mga conflict sa schedule at gipit din sa budget. Naiintindihan ko. Kaya naghanap ako ng ibang pwedeng isama. Naalala ko si May—mahilig din siya mag-travel, kaya tinanong ko siya. At first, mukhang game siya. Pero tulad ni Ken, hindi rin siya pwede. Hindi rin natuloy ang trip.

Ang hindi ko inaasahan ay ang reaksyon ni Ken nang malaman niyang tinanong ko si May.

“Tinawag mo siya?” tanong niya, may bigat sa boses.

“Sabi ko naman sa’yo, ikaw ang una kong tinanong. Hindi ka pwede, kaya nagtanong ako sa iba,” paliwanag ko. “At hindi rin naman natuloy yung trip.”

“Eh, si May na lang?” tanong niya ulit, mas seryoso, mas malamig.

“Wala namang nangyari sa amin, Ken. Wala rin akong balak. Wala akong nararamdaman sa kanya. Sinabi mo ring okay ka na, ‘di ba?”

Hindi siya sumagot. Tumahimik lang. At mula noon, nag-iba na ang ihip ng hangin sa pagitan namin. Hindi na siya ganoon ka-open. Hindi na rin kami nagkikita. Parang unti-unting lumayo ang loob niya, at hindi ko na siya makausap tulad ng dati.

Minsan, natitigilan ako. Napapaisip.

Pagkatapos ng nangyari, pakiramdam ko nagkamali ako kasi ako naging dahilan sa nasirang pagkakaibigan. Hindi ko sinadyang saktan ang kaibigan ko. Hindi ko sinadyang ipagpalit ang tiwala niya. Pero sa mata niya, baka ganon ang naging itsura. Baka para sa kanya, may linya akong hindi ko dapat tinawid, kahit pa wala akong masamang intensyon.",6,1745908618.0,OffMyChestPH,10,0.8,False
1kahgei,https://www.reddit.com/r/andor/comments/1kahgei/colonel_petigar_really_represents_the_true_horror/,Colonel Petigar really represents the true horror of the Empire,"Here's the thing: Petigar is a good man. He’s probably that guy who lives next door - a bit aloof but polite, good mannered, hardworking, and law-abiding. Maybe he even supports some charity; nothing fancy, just a small donation here and there. And most importantly, if your house were on fire he would risk his life to save you from the burning wreckage.

Because no selfish individual will risk their life for someone else's family in a hostage situation. It doesn’t matter if the family in question is high-ranking; if you make yourself noticeable in a hostage scenario, there’s a good chance you’ll be the first to die. And what good is dying for your personal gains?

Petigar's actions were entirely genuine. The rebels crossed 'his' moral line by holding a child at gunpoint, and he acted upon his better conscience.



And here’s where the horror truly kicks in:

A lot of people will rightly point out that Petigar was completely complicit in the cultural destruction and exploitation of the Aldhanis. This is true, and yet we already engage in similar activities today. We don't think about sweatshops and plantations run by child labor when we go about our daily lives. Heck, a good number of people here may even be working for the companies involved in these exploitations, managing projects, planning import/exports, contracts, or even human resource management. 

Yet if we see a child actually in danger we WILL become enraged, and a good number of us will even risk our safety to help out (at least I hope so). This is not hypocritical. We just don't feel guilty when the threat is not direct. 

If anything what the Empire is doing to the Aldhanis are alot less evil compared to what a lot of businesses are doing irl. If good people on Earth generally do not pause to think about this, Petigar surely has no reason to think about it as well. 

I would also like to mention that this is how Gorn came to see the wrongdoings of the Empire - He was the one who actually conversed and met up with the locals, and he got to see the pain and suffering first hand (and yes, I am aware of his romantic relationship with a local person). Petigar, on the otherhand, does not see any of this. He only get to see numbers and reports, and there's no natural stimulation for him to think about the Aldhanis.

This is exactly how the society of ""good imperial citizens"" continue to support evil - we just don't think about what's not directly infront of us, and even if we do, only a few will act upon it (eg. I am drinking coffee right now), and this in a sense is a horror on its own. ",6,1745908601.0,andor,1,0.88,False

I will save some time for everyone and tell long story short: I'm male 32yo, in a marriage with a woman 26yo and we have two kids. I absolutely love my kids, 1.5yo and 6yo. However, wedding happened because she got somehow pregnant (even though we had protection), but kids are 100% mine and I didn't back down, because, as I thought, I was in love. It was alright at first, I was mostly at work and spend most time with kids.

Some time later wife started constantly to ask for more. More this, more that, I need this, I need that, and she doesn't work. I just give her around 2000$/month for the expenses and from time to time buy her stuff she can't afford herself, including a car.

She loves foreign countries. I don't travel by plane for psychological reasons. I used to travel a lot, but stopped after some situations and now travel by car. I am absolutely getting mad and furious, when asked about another vacation, which she wants and I don't. I've spend another 15000$ for her vacation recently and more is on the horizon.

Right now she's on a vacation with kids, mom and some other people. I'm at work. After 6 days I've managed to loose 5kg somehow, slowly started getting back in sporty shape (I was a powerlifter and wide is all the right places), clean my mind a little and have new ideas for work. And now for the problems...

Wife doesn't turn me on. She got lots of bad weight. And refused to loose it. I live without a sexual drive about 2 years already. It really upsets me. And the worst part, in a coffee shop I've met a woman, which is 10/10 in my subjective opinion. She's smart, pretty, sporty, divorced, has a kid and gives me straight signals that she wants me. I know that it seems mostly like a moral trap, I'm not a cheater, but overall life quality drives me crazy. In my 32 I feel like I'm 62. Wife refuses to loose weight, no sex life, lots of work, I have a desire to be liked by other women again. Honestly whole situation feels like I'm in some bad TV series. Can't have sex on the side because I'm not a cheater, can't have sex with my wife because I can't look at her anymore and she constantly gets on my nerves.

Looking for someone who’s tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I’m a laid-back, 5’8” guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots—like Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I’m equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

Okay, let’s be real for a second. Have you ever found yourself *overthinking* a decision so much that you could basically write an entire novel on it? Yeah, me too. 🤦‍♂️ You know that point when you’re staring at a wall of options, and instead of feeling empowered, you just feel… *stuck*? 

We’ve all been there. Whether it’s choosing a new fitness routine, deciding on a career move, or planning your next big adventure, sometimes our brains just crank it up to eleven and get all jammed up. But here’s a little secret: you can break that cycle with something I like to call a **""Clarity Sprint.""** 🚀

So, what’s a Clarity Sprint? It’s simple: **10 minutes of focused decision-making action**. No distractions. No overthinking. Just pure, unfiltered clarity. Ready? Here’s how to do it:

### 🔍 The Steps to Your Clarity Sprint:

1. **Set the Scene**: Find a quiet spot and grab a timer. Your couch, your bedroom, even a local coffee shop—whatever makes you feel comfy.
   
2. **Define Your Dilemma**: Write down the decision you’re stuck on. Be specific. Instead of “Should I change jobs?”, try “Should I apply for the marketing position at XYZ Corp?” 

3. **Brain Dump**: For 2-3 minutes, jot down every single thought that comes to your mind related to that decision. Pros, cons, fears, excitement—let it flow like a free-write session in high school English class. 

4. **Prioritize**: Quickly go through your dump of thoughts and highlight the **top three** things that stand out to you. What feels most crucial? 

5. **Commit to Action**: Choose one actionable step you can take immediately to move forward. Maybe it’s sending that job application, reaching out to a friend for advice, or just Googling more info!

6. **Reflect**: As the timer goes off, take a deep breath. Feel the clarity starting to seep in? What did you learn about your priorities? 

### 🧠 Why It Works:

- **Time Constraint**: Giving yourself only 10 minutes forces you to cut through the noise. You can’t analyze every little detail when you’re on the clock!
- **Focus**: It’s easy to get distracted by what-ifs and could-bes. The sprint keeps you laser-focused on the here and now.
- **Momentum**: Taking just that one step can create a domino effect that leads to more confidence and more decisions made!

And hey, it’s totally okay to feel antsy during the process. Who doesn’t want to make *perfect* decisions all the time? But remember: “Perfect” is often the enemy of “Done.” 

So next time you feel that familiar feeling of overthinking creeping in, just set your timer and sprint! 🏃‍♀️💨 You might be surprised at how much clearer everything can get in just ten minutes.
