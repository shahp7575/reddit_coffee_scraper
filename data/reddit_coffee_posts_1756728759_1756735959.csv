I am wondering if anyone here owns a coffee house or knows approximately how much will it cost to open a small coffee house with 1 employee serving as a barista, cashier. And a max total of 10 tables.

Additionally Is there a way to get it licensed to stay open after 11pm?",0,1756735853.0,budapest,0,0.5,False

I'm 29/F/USA (I know, not yet 30, but trust me, I feel like I am with all the grandma hobbies I have) and looking to bring some joy into my life in the version through handwritten letters--because who doesn't like their mail box filled with fun postcards and stationary containing chicken scratch about whatever is happening in life. I am not new to the snail mail hobby, and quite enjoy it. You want a plethora of letters and postcards, since I seemingly travel a lot for work, then I'm your gal!

A little bit about me:  

* I'm a bookworm that has her Goodreads account passive-aggressively bullying her into trying to read more since I'm behind on my reading challenge for the year.
* I have a soft spot for writing way too many postcards to my penpals, which, usually gets me the question of ""Don't you literally do anything else with your time?"" 
* My mortal enemy are the field rats behind my house that I think live in the drainage ditch because they terrorize my garden. Just imagine me camping out like I'm some Vietnam Vet trying to vanquish them with fire (which, hasn't happened yet, but the possibilities are endless here. I'm open to ideas?).
* On the plant note, I also really love house plants, but they need to thrive in a ""dynamic fast-pace working environment"" and you know what? Some of them can't. And that's just simply unacceptable. What do you mean you need water frequently?  Just. The absolute audacity. 
* I also have a dream, of all dreams, of wheezing my way through hikes at all of our National Parks. I do like to hike, but I also gaslight myself every. single. time. telling myself that I am way more fit than I actually am. Because why not? Either I'm going to vanquish the mountain, or the mountain will vanquish me. Yosemite came close. LOL. 

What I'd love in a penpal:  

* Do you breathe? Can you write? On a less factious note, I don't care if you're male or female, international or 30 minutes down the street from me, let's fill each other's mail boxes with letters!
* As long as you're 25+ I think we would find something fun to write to each other about! 

To start us off: 

* What's something small that made you smile this week?
* What's one thing that you collect, or wish that you did collect?

1n5por1,https://i.redd.it/3dwjmm099kmf1.jpeg,Dove soap vibes. Noa and My Pearls,"I love the original creamy white Dove soap bar, it‚Äôs actually the only soap I use now. I have always wanted to find a perfume that smells clean and creamy like Dove and I combed through my collection and decided these two were the closest so I thought I‚Äôd do a comparison review type of thing.

The round bottle in the picture is Noa by Cacharel and the tall bottle is My Pearls by The Verchant of Venice. I did a quick price search and you can easily find both discounted. Noa 100ml retails $92 ($31 on FragranceNet) and My Pearls 100ml retails $235 ($126 on MaxAroma) Prices fluctuate so these might already not be current, just an example of cost since these are not the same in price. 

‚Ä¢Noa by Cacharel released 1998 

Top notes are White Musk, Peony, Freesia, Green Notes, Peach and Plum; middle notes are Lily, Lily-of-the-Valley, Green Grass, Jasmine, Ylang-Ylang and Rose; base notes are Coffee, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Coriander, Incense, Tonka Bean and Cedar.

‚Ä¢ My Pearls by The Merchant of Venice released 2020

Top notes are Violet Leaves, Cassis and Pink Pepper; middle notes are White Flowers, Rose and Lily-of-the-Valley; base notes are Tonka Bean, Sandalwood, Mahonial, Sylkolide and Cedar.

So when comparing these two fragrances directly to each other, they are not the same at all. Noa is more floral powdery while My Pearls is more powdery creamy. Noa starts out a lot more crisp and complex. My Pearls is more linear and fluffy. They both have that vibrant clean burst in the beginning and then settle down into that soft soap on skin after a shower kind of smell. Both have cedar and sandalwood in the base so that‚Äôs why I imagine the dry downs are similar. Both *feel* clean. Warm steamy skin from the shower, wrapped in a clean fluffy towel, fresh skin before lotion. 

I do want to point out that Noa has a coffee note that I personally do note detect, however this could pull it less Dove if it is prominent for you on your skin. 

As far as performance, My Pearls lasts longer and is stronger. But it is more powdery. Noa is more complex and has phases, while My Pearls basically stays the same throughout. Both can turn baby wipe on me if over sprayed. 

Noa feels a little bit more beige where My Pearls is brite white. Like the feeling difference of showering at home verses showering in a fancy hotel. I don‚Äôt know if this is simply subliminal because I am aware of the price. I wish I could go back in time and smell both completely blind. Noa does not smell cheap at all and My Pearls does not exclusively smell expensive, they both smell clean, cozy, inviting, and warm fresh. 

Noa feels a little colder, cool air in the morning stepping out of the bathroom into a different room. My Pearls is warm throughout, steamy shower air surrounding you while you wipe off fog from the bathroom mirror. 

I love both and use Noa nearly every night before bed, I use My Pearls when I go for self care stuff like doctors/facials. 

What are YOUR favorite Dove types of perfumes? Do you use either of these? I would love to hear your thoughts!

And-most importantly-what does the final paper look like when you open it at 2:07 a.m. with coffee in hand?

# 1) What is LeoEssays & what‚Äôs the reputation like?

**LeoEssays** is an academic assistance platform offering writing, editing, and problem-solving across common writing tasks: essays, reports, research papers, literature reviews, presentations, and more. The brand positions itself as student-centric-fast turnaround, responsive support, and an emphasis on originality. From public leoessays reviews and community chatter, the reputation centers on reliability under tight deadlines and accessible communication with writers.

**Bottom line:** A modern academic service focused on speed, clarity, and student-appropriate tone.

# 2) Who is this service for-and why test it?

LeoEssays is aimed at:

* Students juggling multiple courses and deadlines
* Working professionals in continuing education
* ESL learners who want polish and formatting help
* Anyone who needs a sanity-saving edit or a quality cross-check

I chose to test it because students often ask for a practical, balanced[ **https://leoessays.com/**](https://leoessays.com) review: not hype, not horror-just specifics.

# 3) Key features at a glance (with concise commentary)

* **Reputation:** Student-focused, deadline-capable. *Comment:* Not flashy; it leans on consistency rather than marketing fireworks.
* **Support (24/7 chat/email):** *Comment:* Quick to acknowledge, short wait times, and polite.
* **Pricing:** Scales by level, length, and deadline. *Comment:* Clear tiers; editing is cheaper than writing; urgent jobs cost more (as they do anywhere).
* **Deadlines:** From urgent (hours) to long-term (weeks). *Comment:* The service is comfortable with tight windows-still, earlier is always cheaper.
* **Free options:** Title page, references, formatting. *Comment:* The must-haves are included without nickel-and-diming.

# 4) Ordering experience (what they offer + example brief)

**What‚Äôs offered:**

* Writing from scratch (essays, research papers, reports)
* Editing/proofreading (grammar, clarity, flow, formatting)
* Problem-solving/test-type tasks (calculations, code checks, slide decks)

**Example brief I used (representative scenario):**

* **Topic:** ‚ÄúSocial Media‚Äôs Impact on First-Year Student Retention-A Mini Literature Review‚Äù
* **Level:** Undergraduate (sophomore/junior)
* **Length/Deadline:** \~1,200 words due in 48 hours
* **Instructions:** 6‚Äì8 scholarly sources, APA 7th, double-spaced, headings, and a neutral/academic tone

**How they handled it:** The draft hit the structural notes (intro ‚Üí themed sections ‚Üí conclusion), included current sources, and used APA correctly (in-text + references). Tone was academic but readable-no thesaurus gymnastics. I requested a small tweak to the method section; the revision landed fast.

# 5) Pros & cons (objective, with a positive tilt)

**Pros**

* **Speed + reliability:** Urgencies handled without panic.
* **Formatting competence:** APA/MLA/Chicago applied consistently.
* **Communication:** Writer chat is usable; support is responsive.
* **Quality-to-cost balance:** Editing/proofreading is cost-effective; writing quality feels ‚Äústudent-authentic,‚Äù not ghostwritten-professor.
* **Free essentials:** Title page, references, and formatting included.

**Cons**

* **Ultra-specialized topics:** Niche, highly technical subjects may need extra guidance or additional sources from you.
* **Very short deadlines:** Possible, but you‚Äôll pay a premium (true industry-wide).
* **Voice calibration:** If you want it to sound exactly like your past papers, share a sample-don‚Äôt skip this step.

# 6) Support, speed, quality, feedback

* **Support:** Courteous, quick, and practical; no scripted labyrinth.
* **Speed:** On-time delivery for the test brief; revision turnaround was prompt.
* **Quality:** Strong structure, source integration, and formatting; stylistically ‚Äústudent-real.‚Äù
* **Feedback loop:** Built-in chat + revision window help align the final tone.

# 7) Pricing breakdown by service type (how to think about it)

* **Writing from scratch:** Priced by academic level, length, and deadline. Longer runway = better price.
* **Editing/Proofreading:** Noticeably cheaper than writing; ideal if you already have a draft or outline.
* **Test/Problem-solving:** Cost varies with complexity and tools required (stats packages, coding, etc.).
* **Add-ons:** Plagiarism report, extended revisions, or specialist extras are typically available.

*Tip:* If your budget is tight, consider commissioning a robust outline + editing pass. You get structure and polish without full-writing pricing.

# 8) How to place an order (step-by-step)

1. **Create an account** at[ leoessays.com](https://leoessays.com).
2. **Select service type:** writing, editing, or problem-solving.
3. **Enter details:** topic, level, length, deadline, style (APA/MLA/Chicago), rubric, and any must-use sources.
4. **Attach materials:** syllabus, lecture notes, example past paper (for tone).
5. **Choose extras:** plagiarism report, progressive delivery, etc.
6. **Confirm quote & pay:** transparent summary before checkout.
7. **Chat with your writer:** clarify goals, share examples, agree on tone.
8. **Receive draft ‚Üí review:** request tweaks during the revision window.
9. **Finalize & download:** do a last quick read to ensure it matches your voice.

# 9) Quality & formatting (APA/MLA, errors, polish)

Expect clean formatting with correct headers, in-text citations, and reference pages. For APA/MLA, they follow the edition specifics (e.g., APA 7th). Minor style or emphasis changes are normal-use the revision option to align with your instructor‚Äôs pet preferences (we all have that one professor who loves a particular heading style).

# 10) Policies: plagiarism, revisions, refunds

* **Plagiarism:** Work is presented as original with sources cited. Optional originality reports are available.
* **Revisions:** There‚Äôs a defined revision window-use it proactively.
* **Refunds:** Case-based; typically tied to missed deadlines or unmet instructions. As with any service, read the policy text before placing urgent/complex orders.  

# 11) Trust factor-can you rely on it?

From a process perspective, LeoEssays is transparent about what affects pricing and timing, the interface is straightforward, and support is reachable. It passes the ‚Äústudent usability‚Äù test: you don‚Äôt need a project-management degree to place an order and keep it on track. Many[ https://leoessays.com/](https://leoessays.com) reviews echo the same themes-predictable timelines and cooperative revisions.

# 12) Recommendation-who benefits most?

***Yes, I‚Äôd recommend LeoEssays*** ***for****:*

* Students who value structured, citation-ready drafts
* Learners who want hands-on editing to improve clarity and formatting
* Busy students who need a reliable backup plan under deadline pressure

If you‚Äôre pursuing a hyper-specialized or graduate-level quantitative project, come prepared with sources, datasets, and explicit methodological notes. The better your brief, the better your result-true for any service, not just LeoEssays.

# Final word

If you‚Äôre browsing leoessays reviews and need a clear, balanced take: LeoEssays offers a credible mix of speed, support, and student-appropriate writing. As always, own your process-provide a tight brief, share a sample of your voice, and use revisions wisely. That combination will make LeoEssays **(**[**https://leoessays.com/**](https://leoessays.com)**)** work hard for you-and keep your 2:07 a.m. coffee for celebration rather than crisis.",1,1756735445.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False
1n5pki7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1n5pki7/aita_for_not_being_a_good_dog_sitter/,AITA For not being a good dog sitter?,"So I have dogsitted for my best friend multiple times in the past 2yrs and shes always says I do good.

The issues started when my dad had to go to the hospital due to a bad fall and I had to be away from them for more than 4hrs. And she had recently gotten a pup no older than 6m old. She was upset that I had been gone for so long cause the puppy wasnt crate trained yet and was crying(as most dogs do when getting crate trained). I told her it was a emergency.

This puppy that she got was suppose to be going everywhere with her.Its a small breed of dog and she has two large ones. One of the large ones pretty much hates people and the other is to people friendly and wants to jump.

Well obviously she didn't take the puppy very much with her like she said cause every time I dog sitted for her this year the puppy was there every time except once. And I have a part time job. Dog sitting is extra money. She never started paying me extra even with the puppy being added in. $20 a day is what I was getting.

Due to the one dogs issues with people he barks a lot if he sees anyone walk by the house out the front windows. Due to this and the severe heat wave going on she put blinds up and told me to keep them closed. I have depression and I cannot stand being in dark places constantly!

Also while I was there I found a couple holes in the backyard that the dogs had decided to dig trying to get out of the fence. I'm positive this was from the pup cause guess what? She was going in to heat for the first time and I wasn't told that until AFTER I started dog sitting.

By the time the last day came around she was heading home earlier than expected and I had already started cleaning. I had done washed her bedding, made sure the shower was clean,  vacuumed, threw a couple things in to wash, loaded the dishwasher, cleaned counters and stove, and threw out everything I could remember to in the fridge.

She had some dirty dishes left from before I got there and I wasn't able to fit everything in the washer. Yes I did leave them. Along with 1 coffee cup and a cutting board cause 1. You can't put it in the dishwasher plus it was full. 2. Half that mess wasn't mine.

Well apparently it wasn't good enough and I didn't do a good job with the dogs this time. Apparently they were constantly anxious and whining in their crates whenever I was gone and she checked her indoor cameras, I didnt clean up after myself well enough, and I'm at fault for the holes in her yard. She said she just didn't feel like I was doing well enough with them the last couple of times and had hired someone new. I had to ask for my money from her via cashapp for the first time ever cause she didn't pay me the day she said she would and I needed the funds due to bills. In total I made $350 for 2 weeks.

I love her. I love her dogs but now I feel like I have been used this whole time. I also know for a fact the new sitter is making more than $20hr. AITA?",1,1756735441.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I'm hosting a free community event at Stories Coffee Company (114th and Davenport location) on September 3rd from 6-8pm for International Generalists Day.

We're celebrating alongside 80 cities spanning 30+ countries!

What is a generalist?

I think of generalists like the chefs of the professional world. When a chef looks at eggs, butter, rice, and corn they see opportunities for dishes that span across cuisines and cultures.

In the same way that a chef can take eggs and use them in a multitude of ways, generalists can take their skills and use them across teams, departments, and disciplines.

Are you a resourceful problem solver who tends to think bigger picture? Do you have a tendency to connect dots and see core commonalities across varied fields and roles? Does your career path make people scratch their head? Come hang out with us!

Don't know if you're a generalist? Attend the event to learn more and connect with other generalist-curious folks!

Our event vibes are: warm, friendly, relaxed, and curious!

This is our opportunity to be a part of a global movement of people meeting all together, on the same day to celebrate non-linear careers, breaking outside of siloes and celebrating the value of generalists! üéâ

‚ÄºÔ∏è Important note: There are absolutely no sales pitches, ""join this or that"", or anything of that nature. I just want to gather together with other generalists for time to connect and build community.

The whole thing was a nightmare. Two hours of ""tilt your chin slightly left... no, too much... now smile but not too much..."" Meanwhile I'm sitting there thinking about all the other stuff I could be doing on my Saturday.

Final result? Three photos. That's it. Three decent shots for $350 and half my weekend gone.

I've been down this rabbit hole researching AI headshot services since then (because apparently I hate myself and want to feel worse about my choices lol). Most of them are still pretty expensive ($40-80) and take forever to process.

BUT - and this is why I'm posting - I stumbled across something called Headshot Maniac that's apparently launching soon. Get this: 60 second processing time, only $11, and you get multiple professional variations with different backgrounds and styles instead of just a few shots.

The speed thing is what really got me. Like, literally faster than making coffee. And for $11vs the $350 I just blew? Come on.

I know, I know, sounds too good to be true. But honestly after my studio experience I'm willing to try anything. Got on their early access list just in case.

Anyone else been through headshot hell lately? Please tell me I'm not the only one getting burned by these studios...",1,1756735172.0,headshots,1,0.99,False

1n5peey,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1n5peey/reveal_if_tide_power_pods_detergent_really/,Reveal if Tide Power PODS Detergent Really Brightens Whites Fast,"Tide Power PODS Plus Ultra OXI White and Bright Laundry Detergent, 63 Count, recently made its way into my laundry routine, and it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôve had plenty of chances to put it through the wringer‚Äîliterally. With promises of advanced stain removal and whitening power, this product positions itself as a must-have for anyone looking to simplify their laundry experience. Here‚Äôs everything I discovered during my hands-on testing.

**Design and Convenience**  
The pre-measured pod format is undeniably convenient, especially for someone like me who tends to be a little heavy-handed with liquid detergent. These compact detergent pods fit snugly into the drum without the need for scoops, mess, or measuring cups. Tossing a single pod into the laundry machine is all it takes. I didn‚Äôt have to deal with sticky lids or spilled powder, which instantly made laundry day a bit more pleasant. The Tide Power PODS Plus Ultra OXI pods are especially helpful when tackling loads filled with workout clothes, school uniforms, and everyday wear. I often found myself marveling at how effortless the process had become.

**Key Benefits**  
The product boasts advanced stain removal, whitening abilities, and a bleach-free formula, all of which were noticeable in my testing. Here‚Äôs what stood out:  
- Incredible brightening on whites, even without bleach.  
- Effective stain removal for everything from coffee stains to grass and dirt from kids‚Äô soccer outfits.  
- Safe on both whites and colors, so I wasn‚Äôt worried about accidental disasters during mixed loads.  

[Check Tide Power PODS Plus Ultra OXI price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0cqksxk3c/)

**Performance Under Testing**  
My primary concern when testing a new detergent is whether it can handle my family‚Äôs range of laundry challenges. From stubborn barbecue sauce stains to the sheer grime of outdoor play, these pods performed admirably. I‚Äôve even washed some particularly tough stains without pretreating them first, just to see how well the pods operated on their own. More often than not, my clothes came out looking fresh. Even older garments regained some vibrancy, as the whitening power seemed effective without damaging the fabric.

That being said, heavier loads or particularly soiled items occasionally required two pods instead of one. For smaller households, this likely won‚Äôt be an issue. However, for anyone with a larger family or heavier laundry demands, the pod-per-load ratio might start to tip less into ‚Äúvalue‚Äù territory.

**Good Aspects**  
Something I appreciated here is how Tide truly simplified the process of doing laundry. No additional bleach or stain removers were necessary, and the pods worked well even in cold water cycles.  
- Perfect for those who want all-in-one convenience.  
- Works in both HE (high efficiency) and standard washing machines.  
- Fresh, long-lasting scent on clothes that didn't feel overpowering.  

**Areas of Concern**  
While these pods impressed on so many fronts, there were a few downsides worth noting:  
- The strong fragrance might not suit everyone, especially those with sensitivities to heavily-scented products.  
- Price per load might feel a little steep for larger households using multiple pods per cycle.  
- The pods sometimes left a slight residue when improperly placed or used in overly large loads.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to other laundry pods like Gain Flings or Persil pods, this product stands out for its superior stain removal and whitening capabilities. Gain Flings, for example, tend to focus more on scent, but they lack the same level of cleaning power. Persil pods come close in terms of stain-fighting efficiency but fall a bit short when it comes to keeping whites looking radiant over time. On the flip side, products like Arm & Hammer pods sacrifice cleaning strength for affordability, making Tide Power PODS Plus Ultra OXI the premium option for those willing to pay a little more for consistent results. Overall, this product feels like the better fit for those juggling a mix of whites and colors, while competitors might work better for targeted use cases.

**Cost Efficiency**  
The pods offer an undeniably high level of convenience and performance. However, their premium pricing is something to weigh carefully. With options catering to various load sizes and laundry needs, I‚Äôd argue that the investment makes sense for families who value performance and time-saving over sheer cost savings. If whiteness, stain-fighting capabilities, and simplicity are on your laundry must-have list, these pods are more than likely to justify the slightly higher cost.

his evidence: 2,800 people signed up for early access. 74 booked demos. zero sales after two months.

""maybe we built the wrong thing,"" he says.

wrong diagnosis. his product actually solves a real problem elegantly. i've seen the demos, solid stuff. but he's pitching enterprise workflow software to solopreneurs because ""the market is bigger.""

this is the GTM death spiral most of us know too well.

when launches fail (and 9 out of 10 do), founders immediately blame the product. then they burn months rebuilding features nobody asked for.

but the real culprits are usually elsewhere: chasing the wrong ICP because bigger markets feel safer, building offer structures that don't match how people actually buy, picking distribution channels where your customers don't hang out, or positioning that sounds exactly like everyone else in the space.

everyone wants the hockey stick growth story. but nobody talks about the brutal middle part where you question everything you built and wonder if you're just delusional.

the companies that make it learn to read early signals correctly. terrible demo conversion usually means audience problem. high trial-to-paid drop-off points to offer mismatch. great engagement but no referrals? most likely a positioning issue disguised as product-market fit.

most founders i know went through this at least once, that moment where you realise you've been having the right conversation with completely the wrong people.

anyone else been through this cycle? what were your early warning signs vs. false alarms? (happy to sanity-check your GTM setup if you‚Äôre stuck in it).",1,1756734674.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

   ‚ÄúNo, Anita. All of my children are fully grown now, and lead their own lives.‚Äù 

    This made absolutely no sense. She‚Äôs only 44! There is no possible way she had twenty five other children before I was born, she was only nineteen when I was born. She has to be delusional. Maybe the stress of constantly being on call at a hospital finally got to her head. Maybe this is an onset of mental illness. Maybe she did have a lot of miscarriages, and either of those things has exacerbated her delusions. There was no rational explanation for what she said other than that.

    ‚ÄúMother, maybe we should get you to a doctor. It isn‚Äôt possible for you have to twenty six full grown children. That‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù I made my tone gentle and low, hoping I wouldn‚Äôt distress her.

   ‚ÄúI knew you would say that.‚Äù She replied, bending down so her chest was against her knees. Her hand reached beneath the couch, searching for something. Her fingers had found whatever she was looking for, and an ancient book followed as she withdrew her hand. It was bound in leather, probably almost as old as our house. The edges of the pages were yellowed with age and torn on some.

   ‚ÄúThat is why I found my old photo album to show you.‚Äù

   The leather creaked as she opened the cover. The photos looked as old as the practice of photography itself. They were made from thick paper, almost like cardboard, pinned onto the pages by little metal boarders on the corners. The first one was of a girl at around 7 years old with an older woman who she resembled, both of their expressions cold and flat. The girl wore a simple sleeveless dress that went past her feet, it was clearly too big for her. As I glanced across the first pages worth, I came to the conclusion this had to be my Grandmother I‚Äôd never gotten to meet. Pictures across what I would guess was 8 years or so from the first at 7 years old for Mother up until she was in her mid teens. We looked almost identical, as did she and Grandmother. The page protested as I gently turned it, trying hard to not create any new tears or damage. This was a familial artifact that had lasted for probably a century. 

   How was Mother so young in these? They were clearly taken in the early 1900‚Äôs, yet she was just a small girl back then. 

   ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶ How were you so young in these? These are over 70 years old, yet you were a little girl?‚Äù I asked with pure confusion twisting my inflection. 

   She nodded. ‚ÄúI was born in 1887, in London. I was the thirteenth child born to my Mother. She was born in 1693. Last I had heard from her, she‚Äôs living with her youngest in Ontario. We still send each other letters, as well as her other daughters. All of my sisters have their own daughters, and live all across the globe.‚Äù

   I‚Äôm dreaming aren‚Äôt I?

   ‚ÄúWait wait wait. Your Mother is over 300 years old? And she only looked to be about 50 in these pictures? How? How have you lived so long‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice trailed off as I tried to piece it together. 

   Mother fondly gandered at her family album, smiling gently down at the memories encapsulated on card stock and eventually paper. As she turned the pages slowly, the photos became more modernized. From the beginnings of photography, to the grainy and slightly light washed look of the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs, to today. I was too busy trying to wrap my mind around it all as she gazed down at them in her lap. My Mother was over 100 years old, but didn‚Äôt look a day over 35. She had always looked young, younger than the age she had always fed to me, but beneath the skin were bones older than the World Wars. 

   ‚ÄúMother‚Ä¶ What does all this-‚Äú

   My hand flew up to meet my mouth. A searing, flaming white hot pain radiated from the spot that had been feeling strange all day. A choked gasp escaped as I hung my head, trying to keep myself up straight as the pain made me dizzy. 

   ‚ÄúOh, marvelous!‚Äù Mother cheered, her hands gleefully clapping together infront of her chest. ‚ÄúYour mature teeth are coming in!‚Äù

   ‚ÄúM-My what?‚Äù My voice asked shaky and unstead. 

   My stomach was churning as whatever was going on hammered into my skull. It felt like a jackhammer buzzing against the bone, and I could hear chipping and crunching as I writhed where I sat. A piece of my jaw bone was breaking inside of my skin. I groaned as I felt needle sharp pains in my upper gums just above my teeth. The jackhammering sensation stopped as the burn of piercing skin replaced it. Little drops of blood began to run down my lip as the feeling spread across more surface area. 

   ‚ÄúMother, what is happening?!‚Äù I screamed, ubruptly standing from my seat. 

   My mouth was salivating from the sensation, with long strands of spit mixing with my blood as they fell to the dirty carpet. My hands were shaking as I pushed a finger past my lip. It jolted right back out as I felt a prick from the wound. More blood pooled in a little droplet on my finger. 

   ‚ÄúYour mature teeth, my dear! They have finally poked through!‚Äù She added with a jovial note, ‚ÄúYour first hunger will arrive very soon!‚Äù 

   Finally, the agony relented. It subsided just as fast as it had set in. It was 20 seconds of the worst pain I‚Äôve ever experienced in this lifetime. Struggling to catch my breath, I took a few long strides to the giant mirror over the mantle. When I raised my lip to investigate, I had found the source that pricked me. On either side set in above my canines were two fangs. Both were about an inch long, as thick as a thin paint brush, and the point was deviously sharp. With how easily it broke my skin, I could probably cut anything with ease. Maybe even bone if I tried hard enough. 

   Another clap sounded behind me. ‚ÄúThe maturing process is nearly complete, my dear.‚Äù I watched in the mirror as she stepped up beside me and felt her arm slide around my shoulders. ‚ÄúYou are nearly ready to be off on your own. Have children of your own.‚Äù

   I shuddered a bit at the thought. I‚Äôm not even out of high school yet and she‚Äôs talking about me having a baby? That‚Äôs definitely not in my plans. I‚Äôm not going to be a teen mom struggling to hold it all together as I manuever my way through the beginning of adulthood. I had bigger, more ambitious plans for myself. Then, once my life is all settled and stable, I would have kids. 

   She continued. ‚ÄúOnce that first hunger settles itself into the bowels of your stomach, you will comprehend the primal ancient urges we hold within. Mother told me the moment it had taken hold of her, she knew she needed to feed, and she was unstoppable until it was achieved. The process is quite quick after your mature teeth burst forth. It only took me five days from my 18th birthday for it all to begin. I performed our ritual. By the ending of the third day, I had already found my prey and nutured it for the necessary six months before I fed for the first time. It was the most delectable thing to have ever danced with my tongue. I had found the perfect specimen for my first. Hopefully, your first will be just as delicious.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWhat do we eat Mother?‚Äù I dreaded to hear her answer, but it was a pressing matter. If we didn‚Äôt need to eat regular foods, what did we need to survive? 

   ‚ÄúI will show you soon. First, I‚Äôm sure you would like to know a little about your sisters, hm?‚Äù

   Gently taking my hand, she guided me back to the love seat. More dust puffed up a few inches off of the cloth as I plopped down beside her. The photo album was thrust into my hands. The texture was almost comforting against my palms. Like most leather, it had a slightly rough uneven surface, yet it was somehow softer than any other leather I‚Äôd ever touched. Beneath my skin, it seemed to vibrate in the slightest. Like there was a power inside its pages. Almost like it knew the bloodline pictured within was one with great powers and potential. 

   I opened the cover, the same tired groan protesting from the leather. My eyes took in the images before me, scanning every detail of each of their faces. Grandmother, even at whatever old age she‚Äôd been in these pictures, didn‚Äôt look decrepit or sagging from the years. Her face was lined with crows feet, smile lines, and her skin wasn‚Äôt as resilient as that of a young woman. She looked to be in her early to mid fifties. Her dated short sleeved dress was patterned with little flowers, the plain build hanging down to her ankles. They must have been somewhat wealthy then as she had almost brand new leather boots, the shine from them dimmed slightly by dust resting on the material. 

   ‚ÄúMother was a strict woman.‚Äù Mother began to narate. ‚ÄúShe was raised as a peasant in the Dark Ages. Grandmother has been born in the midst of the Black Plague, and she carried the mindset of the time which overlapped onto Mother. Mother had stayed with Grandmother much longer than most daughters do. She stayed for a hundred and fifty years or so, and even helped Grandmother with her other daughters that came following Mother‚Äôs maturity. They actually raised some of their offspring together, usually claiming to be a widowed aunt and niece to not raise suspicions from the locals wherever they lived at the time.‚Äù 

   I stared at her, my lips pressed thin. Our direct family lines led all the way back to the 1300‚Äôs? That‚Äôs absolutely insane. Do I really believe her on this? I want to, but all rationality I have says otherwise. But I can‚Äôt refute that Mother is in these pictures. The girl has the same nose, same eyes, same hair, same jagged scar across the top of her right shoulder to her collar bone, and the same little mole an inch from her left eye. Unless some strange twist of fate caused a girl from the early 1900‚Äôs to have that scar in the exact place Mother‚Äôs is, there‚Äôs no way it is not her. 

   ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Is your Grandmother still alive too?‚Äù

   Mother‚Äôs lips curled downward slightly. ‚ÄúNo. Generally, our lives end up being around 500 to 600 years. Grandmother died in 1967. She lived over 600 years. Once your body deteriorates as much as hers had, you become unable to reproduce. Reproduction is so vital to our survival because it replenishes our life force.

   ‚ÄúIf you think of our lives in metaphor, they are as a fountain. You are born with your fountain full to the brim, and as time progresses the water within the basen evaporates. Once your life is done, your fountain is empty. When we produce an offspring, it refills our fountain so the water takes numerous times longer for us to die compared to humans. 

   ‚ÄúYour mature teeth become too dull and brittle to feed on prey after a certain age, so then you can no longer replenish the fountains water supply. If they did not break, we could live for all eternity. But, eventually, your body withers to dust. It is a horrific process to bare witness to. Even more so to endure.‚Äù

   Every word she said continued to make my head spin. This is so much to process. How am I supposed to believe this? I have God knows how many sisters, aunts, great-aunts, and maybe even great-great-aunts alive and well all across the globe. Wait, what about male relatives? Are there any?

   ‚ÄúDo we only produce girls?‚Äù

   She adjusted her posture in her seat, looking me in the eyes. ‚ÄúYes, we do. Males do not have the ability to carry what makes us other. If we were to talk scientifically about all we are, I would deduce our otherness comes from the XX chromosomes. I believe our breed cannot be passed to one with a Y chromosome.‚Äù

   My eyes scanned the new faces as I turned the page. Every picture was of someone different standing beside Mother. A young woman in a 1920‚Äôs flapper dress, her hair slicked down and back against her head. Another woman, younger than the first, dressed in an old nurses outfit that seemed to be dated sometime during World War II. The next was in color now, it showed a woman about my age with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. She was smiling with an arm around Mother‚Äôs waist, Mother‚Äôs expression was as flat as it had been in all the previous ones. The rest showed many different women, all stood beside my Mother. 

   I looked up from the page into her eyes. ‚ÄúSo how do we reproduce?‚Äù 

   At some point in my page flipping she had grabbed her tea cup again along with its saucer and was passively taking a sip. She hummed with the liquid still in her mouth. Placing the cup onto its dish, she prepared to speak.

   ‚ÄúWe find human men, and procreate as they do. You find a suitor fitting of your standards, place your ‚Äòspell‚Äô on him, have sex, and birth the offspring.‚Äù Her tone was matter of fact, like I was already supposed to know this. I mean, I guess she‚Äôs right. 

   I noticed her eyes on the page in my lap. She had a small smile on her face. ‚ÄúI am sorry I never told you about your sisters. It is easier to not discuss other family members if they are not in the home. Most everything about us is hard to comprehend before you have the changes that lead to this conversation.‚Äù 

   My final turn of the pages had one picture centered on the back of the previous page. It was me. Mother had taken it about three years ago while we were at the State Fair. I had a massive smile showing my teeth, my hair blowing in a gust of wind. I always became a bit of a ham when infront of a camera. My figure was flat and plain as it had always been before today. I was almost surprised I didn‚Äôt feel any longing for it. I had always been that way, no curves anywhere besides my head, but now I felt different. I felt new, and this new feeling was more comfortable than any I‚Äôve experienced in this form. 

   ‚ÄúWhen did you start having children, Mother?‚Äù

   She hummed again, in thought this time. ‚ÄúI believe I had my first daughter in 1906. It was just past my birthday when she was conceived so I was either 18 or 19 years old.‚Äù

   I nodded, sighing quietly as I closed the book. 

   ‚ÄúIt is quite common to have multiple children in the home at once, but that just was not how it worked out for us.‚Äù I saw her shoulders shrug slightly. ‚ÄúI just have not found the right suitor since your birth. Because you were my last, and it has been eighteen years since I last bore a child, my age has set in on my face more. It is not drastic, but the fine lines set in more and more as I proceed in the aging process.‚Äù 

   She sipped her cup of tea a bit louder this time. Gently placing the book on the dust covered coffee table, I milled over everything she‚Äôd told me thus far while staring into space. So, essentially, I‚Äôm an almost immortal being, who is part human and part something else with no name, who has to produce children in order to continue living. I stiffened as I felt a strange new feeling set in below my ribcage. It pulled on my insides, leaving me feeling hollow and eager for something. We also need to eat. Eat what? She hasn‚Äôt explained that part yet, I guess. We will have to get there at some point, so why not ask again now? I doubt I could contain a rising irritation that followed the brand new sensation known as hunger anyways. 

   ‚ÄúMother, what do we eat?‚Äù I shifted slightly, my discomfort becoming more apparent as the feeling strengthened. ‚ÄúI think that hunger you were telling me about just hit‚Ä¶ I sure have never felt this before.‚Äù

   Her eyes brightened as she set her cup and saucer down in a rush. ‚ÄúAh yes, that is what I forgot! Come with me, dear!‚Äù

   Before I could even answer she grabbed my hand and pulled me to my feet. Her momentum was unhaulting as we rushed through the hall. Through the kitchen, past the cluttered counters, and toward the basement door. I had never been allowed in the basement before, I never even dared get within three feet of the door for fear Mother‚Äôs infamous temper would flare my way. The reasonings always followed along the lines of ‚Äòit is dangerous down there‚Äô, and ‚Äòwhat is down there is not for prying eyes‚Äô. It seems fitting that our family secrets be kept in the most obvious place to hide things. 

   The door was always locked, to detour any mischievous little girls she always said. We stood infront of the door, my eyes scanned the details of the chipping paint as she riffled around under her collar searching for the key. It hung around her neck, and if you didn‚Äôt know the key had a use you‚Äôd just think it was an antique jewelry piece. The silver chain followed her fingers that were clamped around it as it came into view. A tarnished old iron skeleton key. She bent down to the door handle, sliding the key in like she‚Äôd done countless times before. The lock clicked inside its mechanism as she twisted it, a feeling of anticipation settling in my chest above the hunger. I had been told for years I wasn‚Äôt allowed down here, and now I was going to see it for myself. 

   The door swung open with a loud creak. I felt my jaw set itself firmly together as my eyes glanced across the deep claw marks at the bottom. The paint was completely stripped away from fingernails that had once thrashed against the wood in what looked like an escape attempt. Some streaks of deep brown stained the bare wood. Blood stains. I held my breath as I saw an old brittle fingernail laying alone inside the threshold. It had to have been there months if not years with how yellowed with age it was. Dear God, what was I born into? 

   ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù Mother urged, pushing me by the shoulders toward the first step.

Why does one arrangement of atoms in the brain produce the feeling of a warm breeze while another arrangement of atoms produce the sound of a symphony? Why and how are these physical arrangements of tiny, non-perceiving atoms accompanied by perceptions at all? Why aren‚Äôt our brains just complex machines with no inner life? 

It would be absurd to assume a group of non-perceiving atoms, even if arranged in a complex way, could collectively gain the ability to perceive.  

‚ÄúSeparate things simply cannot have unified perception.‚Äù 

You wouldn‚Äôt expect 100,000 people in a stadium to suddenly wake up as one single mind, so in the same way, we can‚Äôt expect a bunch of separate atoms, none of which experience anything on their own, to collectively wake up and start thinking about their day or taste coffee together. 

This is the ‚Äúhard problem of consciousness‚Äù that has puzzled philosophers for many years. 

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs impossible for perceptions to arise from a bunch physical particles bumping around in space, we must question if reality is made of such particles.‚Äù 

This leads us to ask, ‚ÄúIf not particles in space, what DOES actually exist?‚Äù

I avoid places where I know I have to spend (hangouts, trips, etc). I feel drained and lifeless everyday. I‚Äôm very frustrated at this point. 
On top of that, due to some issues I couldn't work through June and July.

What I'm seeking right now is a loan of 800 USDT/USDC, which I can repay in 3 months time with interest (rates can be set by lender). I can pay back in monthly installments. I'm willing to provide any necessary documents (passport, nid, tin certificate, current address, etc.). I am unable to provide any collateral because I don't have any assets in my name. I cannot opt for bank loan because I don't have a steady statement.

I know this is very random but my back is against the wall right now. I have bigger dreams, which I hope to fulfill when I have a stable situation and on my own. But I'm not getting the chance to get to that stable situation. This help will greatly impact my life.

1n5p0el,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n5p0el/help_relatively_experienced_dude_pick_my_next/,Help relatively experienced dude pick my next machine [$7500],"Hey fam. I have experience with E61 machines (a dual-boiler Rocket at my parents house, not sure the model off hand), a new-age lever (Odyssey), and a space-age machine at work (Decent) and have pulled probably 200+ shots on each machine over the last 5 years or so. All three have big flat burr grinders paired at various price points (>$2k). I like light roasts, generally, or medium at least. Usually pulling a 2:1 or 3:1. Through an unexpected inflow of $, I'm fairly price insensitive and plan on getting a high-end probably flat-burr grinder + a NEW MACHINE! But which one?

Through lots of experimentation on the Decent, I gravitated towards traditional lever machine profiles - which led to me getting the Odyssey at home. It's a great machine, but recently I house-sat at my parents house and really got into the Rocket. Loved the simplicity. 

These are all great machines so I'll just list my gripes to help situate you:

Decent - not to sound exactly like the Hoff, but ya - tired of experimenting, tired of feeling like making coffee is yet-another iPadesque experience, not sure I'll use the versatility, and the whole vibe just seems to be more for tinkerers than for me. I'm also constantly worried about repair. The one at work had to be sent back to Asia twice since no shop in Ontario could service it (according to our office manager). Just not sure I'm the target audience on this plus it's pretty expensive. So respect to the company, clearly the future, but too techno for me (no offence to those who love it). But goes without saying, your only limit on making espresso you like is your time and skill in dialling in your perfect profile. But some of us don't want to wear an Apple Watch and drive Teslas everyday, you know? 

Rocket - I'm love the thing - the look and feel, the dual-boiler, the standard espresso it produces, the dead simplicity of it, etc. Downsides are that it's pretty one-note. I suppose all the usual E61 shortcomings apply around temp stability etc but I haven't noticed much so far. It's larger and noisier than the Decent but I don't think that matters much to my home use. 

Odyssey - first of all, huge kudos to this startup - the machine is great and I've used it both with the spring and without. But I've also kind of fallen out of love with lever-style output, and the constant refilling of the reservoir and waiting for it to heat up have all made it a bit awkward to use. Using the Rocket at my parents house has been a reminder of how quickly and easily espresso can be made versus this other more finicky method. The price was great for home machine though and like I said I really like the company and what they are doing. And while the fit and finish is decent, it's not quite as elegant as the Rocket. 

So ya. I'm basically thinking that I should just bite the bullet at go high-end classic machine like the LM Linea Micra. Other than the price, it seems to fit the bill pretty nicely for me and my journey so far. 

But what do you think? All opinions welcome. 

Thanks for reading!

My husband found out about my affair with our neighbor last week. He came home early from work and walked in on us. The whole thing was a disaster that set off a chain of events I never could have imagined.

My husband just stood there for what felt like an eternity. Then he said, ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" My affair partner grabbed his clothes and bolted out the back door. I tried to explain, but my husband told me to shut up and pack my things.

He kicked me out that same day. But here's where my anger took over my judgment. He humiliated me in front of the whole neighborhood when he threw my belongings on the lawn and started yelling about what a cheating whore I was. Everyone came out to watch the spectacle.

So I decided to humiliate him back. I still had access to his phone photos through our shared cloud account. I found some intimate pictures he'd taken early in our marriage. And I posted them to our HOA Facebook group with the caption ""This is what boring looks like. No wonder I had to find satisfaction elsewhere.""

The post stayed up for six hours before someone reported it. But the damage was done. Everyone in our neighborhood saw it. His coworkers saw it because several neighbors work at the same company.

Then his mother showed up at my affair partner's house where I'd been staying. She was crying and begging me to take the post down. She said I was destroying her son's life and reputation.

I told her, ""Maybe you should have raised a man who could keep his wife satisfied instead of whatever boring disappointment you produced.""

She broke down sobbing and said I was evil. I responded that her son drove me to this by being an inattentive husband who never made me feel valued.

Now my husband is suing me for revenge porn and harassment. His lawyer served me papers yesterday. The legal fees are going to bankrupt me, but honestly, I thought I didn't care. I believed I was happy with my affair partner and that his wife would eventually accept reality and leave.

My affair partner seemed supportive at first. He said my husband deserved consequences for embarrassing me. But lately he's been saying I went too far with the photos and that it might complicate things legally.

My sister called yesterday screaming about how I'd lost my mind. She said posting intimate photos without consent is a serious crime and I could face jail time. When I tried to explain that my husband humiliated me first, she hung up on me.

The legal papers arrived three days ago, but that's not even the worst part anymore. My affair partner's wife found out everything, and she's not reacting the way we expected.

She appeared at the door yesterday morning while my affair partner was at work. I assumed she was finally coming to collect her things so they could start divorce proceedings. Instead, she walked past me into the kitchen and started making coffee like she belonged there.

""We need to talk,"" she said. Her voice was eerily calm.

I told her there wasn't anything to discuss. Her husband had chosen me. She needed to accept that and move on with her life.

She actually laughed. ""You think he chose you?""

Then she showed me her phone. Screenshots of text conversations between her and my affair partner from the past two weeks. Right after my husband caught us. He was desperately begging her not to leave him, saying I was just a temporary distraction and he never meant for things to go so far.

""I'm sorry baby, she means nothing. Please don't take the kids. I'll end it today if you give me another chance.""

I felt nauseated reading those words, but I told her those were old messages from when he was confused. Things had changed since then.

""These are from yesterday,"" she said, scrolling down. ""And the day before. And every day since you moved in here.""

More texts. Him promising her he was just letting me stay temporarily until I found somewhere else to go. Him saying he felt sorry for me because my husband had kicked me out. Him calling me ""unstable"" and ""a mistake he regretted.""

The coffee maker finished brewing and she poured herself a cup like nothing unusual was happening.

""Here's what's going to happen,"" she said. ""You're going to pack your things and leave today. I'm not divorcing my husband over some midlife crisis he'll regret for the rest of his life. And you're going to deal with your legal problems without dragging my family deeper into your mess.""

I asked her what she meant about dragging her family into it. She showed me another message. My husband's lawyer had contacted her husband's employer about the Facebook post, investigating whether my affair partner had known about the photos beforehand.

""Did you tell him you were going to post those pictures?"" she asked.

I didn't answer, but my expression must have revealed the truth.

""So you involved my husband in a revenge porn case without his knowledge. That could cost him his job. His security clearance. Everything he's worked for.""

She was right. I hadn't considered that posting those photos might implicate him as an accomplice. I'd been so focused on hurting my husband that I'd blindly dragged my affair partner into potential criminal liability.

""My husband made a terrible mistake, but he doesn't deserve to lose his career over your tantrum,"" she said. ""Neither do my children deserve to lose their father's income because you couldn't handle being rejected.""

Then she made an offer. If I left immediately and never contacted her husband again, she would convince him not to cooperate with the prosecution against me. She explained that his testimony about our affair timeline would make the revenge porn charges much more serious.

I told her she couldn't control what her husband decided to do. He was in love with me now.

She showed me more texts. Recent ones from that very morning. Her husband asking if she thought I would leave voluntarily or if they needed to involve the police to have me removed as a trespasser.

""He's been asking me to help him get rid of you for days. He's too much of a coward to do it himself.""

My phone rang while she was talking. My affair partner calling. She gestured for me to answer and put it on speaker.

""Hey, how are you holding up?"" he said, sounding nervous.

I asked him when he was coming home. There was a long, uncomfortable pause.

""Listen, I think we need to slow things down. My wife is really upset and the kids are asking questions. Maybe you could stay somewhere else for a while? Just until everything settles down?""

His wife watched my face while he spoke.

I asked him directly if he meant what he'd said in his texts to his wife. About me being a mistake and wanting me gone.

Another pause. ""What texts? I don't know what you're talking about.""

His wife held up her phone, showing his contact name at the top of their conversation thread.

""The ones where you called me unstable and said you regretted everything,"" I said.

He started stammering, making excuses about trying to keep peace with his wife until they could figure things out properly.

I hung up on him.

His wife finished her coffee and rinsed the cup. ""My husband is weak and selfish, but he's not leaving his family for someone who commits crimes when they get angry. That's not the kind of person you build a stable life with.""

She was absolutely right, and I despised her for it.

I packed my belongings while she waited in the living room. I didn't have many options. My sister had already told me I couldn't stay with her because of the legal trouble. My parents weren't taking my calls since they'd learned about the Facebook post.

Before I left, his wife stopped me at the door.

""For what it's worth, I'm sorry your marriage ended this way. But destroying other people won't heal whatever's broken inside you.""

I wanted to argue, but I was exhausted. Too angry at myself for believing her husband actually cared about me as more than a convenient escape from his problems.

I'm writing this from a budget motel across town. The same motel where my affair partner and I used to meet before everything exploded. The irony feels deliberate somehow.

My husband's lawyer called this afternoon. They want to settle out of court. I would pay a substantial fine, complete 200 hours of community service, and agree to a permanent restraining order. If I refuse, they're prepared to pursue jail time.

My affair partner has sent a dozen texts asking if I'm okay and where I'm staying. I haven't responded. His wife was right about him being a coward.

I keep thinking about what she said about destroying other people. Maybe that's exactly what I've been doing since my marriage started falling apart. But I still don't know how to process the rage I feel about how everything unfolded.

1n5ovd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n5ovd4/aitah_for_inviting_someone_i_havent_talked_to_in/,AITAH for inviting someone I haven‚Äôt talked to in months to a friend group meetup?,"I (30f) used to have a best friend (30f) for over a decade when I was younger. One day she literally just ghosted me and I had no idea why. We didn‚Äôt fight or have any issues. Just one day we‚Äôre hanging out playing video games. The next day I text her and I don‚Äôt get a response. I was worried she died. It took me 2-3 weeks to get her sister to confirm that she wasn‚Äôt dead. So I took the hint and left her alone. After about a year I sent a closure email, which she responded to. She explained why she ghosted me (overwhelmed with life and my emotions I guess, which fair, I was going through a really hard breakup at the time and I was leaning on her but she never told me that it was negatively affecting her so I couldn‚Äôt change anything). 

We ended up meeting a few times after that, usually once every 6-8 months. Very casual, things like coffee. I took her feedback seriously and I avoided any discussion of my feelings or anything I was struggling with. 

Last year I was really struggling with my health and I ended up having a hard time getting back to people. I was also unemployed for months and I had to ask people to come over and help me with some of the basics (like taking care of pets). It was a dark time for me and luckily my doctor eventually figured out what was wrong and got me started on medication which gave me my quality of life back. But during that time, she had invited me to hang out a few times. I did have to reschedule / cancel a few times. I apologized and explained I was having health issues but I didn‚Äôt go into detail about how bad it was (because of our history). But we did end up hanging out and going to a really fun event together. I thought we both had a blast. We didn‚Äôt talk much after that but that didn‚Äôt feel abnormal. 

One of my really good friends, I guess my adult best friend, and I have talked about creating a female friend group where we can all do fun stuff together like go camping or do spa days together. She also just started her own business in the same field where my ex best friend works. I recently made another friend with the same interests and I got excited because we finally got three people which makes it a small group, but a friend group yay!

So we got to talking about doing something like a board game night. And I remembered that my ex best friend has a lot of similar interests as the other two girls. So I reached out to her to invite her to board game night. 

And she‚Ä¶ she was mad I guess? Texted me back saying it was weird. I responded kindly and firmly that it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúweird‚Äù to issue an invite (I did for other people and they were excited, so it‚Äôs not weird if it‚Äôs not universal) but that if it made her uncomfortable that I was sorry and that I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. Well, she kept talking about how weird it was as if she wanted me to agree with her. Definitely made me feel uncomfortable, like a simple ‚Äúno thank you, please don‚Äôt ask me again in the future‚Äù would have been just fine. 

And she ends up telling me that we weren‚Äôt friends or even acquaintances and she wanted nothing to do with me. I didn‚Äôt really understand why she seemed so angry. And then she said that I ‚Äúignored‚Äù her messages when I was having issues with my health. That‚Äôs probably at least somewhat true. It probably took me days/weeks to respond to messages but I thought she understood? Guess not. I apologize for that too but I really couldn‚Äôt respond to anyone around that time. Even my parents called a few times to check on me because they were worried they hadn‚Äôt heard from me. 

She also said it sounded like I was trying to set her up on a blind friend date‚Ä¶. Because I thought she might hit it off with the other girls. And that it was weird that I was ‚Äúgetting off‚Äù on playing matchmaker‚Ä¶.

So I guess I‚Äôm just wondering, AITAH or weird for inviting someone I wasn‚Äôt that close with to a friend group meetup?

1n5ov5s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5ov5s,Valerica D‚ÄôArkhane,"name: Valerica D‚ÄôArkhane

Title: Lady of the Eternal Night, the Scarlet Matriarch, ‚ÄúThe D‚ÄôArkhane Heiress‚Äù

Age: 1,126 years old (turned in 915 A.D.).

IQ: 315

Height: 5‚Äô1‚Äù often dismissed as a ‚Äúchild‚Äù

Residence: A sprawling obsidian castle carved into the side of a massive mountain, with gothic halls. some rooms as electricity. 

Appearance as seen above
also that's her pet owl, she has no idea how but it's managed to live as long as she has.

Origins

Place of Birth
Born: Transylvania, 899 A.D. (Carpathian Mountains, Romania).

Parents
Lord Casimir D‚ÄôArkhane: Stern, ambitious noble, obsessed with legacy.

Lady Elira D‚ÄôArkhane: Gentle, bookish, and far more caring. She introduced Valerica to astronomy, philosophy, and anatomy at a young age.


Vampiric Origin
In 915 A.D., Casimir entered into a covenant with the vampire lord Dravyn Veythar, offering Valerica as his ‚Äúimmortal heir.‚Äù Casimir was obsessed with the D‚ÄôArkhane line lasting forever. By offering Valerica, he ensured his bloodline would become immortal nobility. He saw her as the ‚Äúperfectl torchbearer‚Äù of his legacy. And at the time, rival lords and invading forces threatened the D‚ÄôArkhanes. By aligning with Dravyn Veythar, Casimir secured the might of a vampire patron to protect his lands.

In exchange for his loyalty, his house would rise above mortal politics. And vampires often granted their vassals unnatural boons, forbidden knowledge, and wealth. Casimir was greedy and shortsighted. 

Dravyn bit her during a moonlit ritual, transforming her into a vampire. Her mortal life cut short for eternity.

Unlike the usual fledglings, Valerica‚Äôs transformation was unnaturally stable, her blood resonating with an intensity that made her stronger, faster, and sharper than most vampires from the very beginning.

Over decades, she grew to dominate her sire in strength and intellect, but she did not surpass the species itself, she is bound by vampiric nature. Casimir expected her to serve as his immortal legacy, loyal to both her father and Dravyn. Instead, within decades, Valerica resented her father‚Äôs betrayal and eventually executed him for it. His hunger for legacy, greed and ambition ironically ended his own bloodline‚Äôs mortal branch. Dravyn is still around, just not in her castle,who knows what he's up to. 

Knowledge & Mastery

Alchemy & Anatomy: Her specialties. She can deconstruct living systems, brew substances with bizarre effects, and experiment with blood on levels mortals couldn‚Äôt dream of.

Astronomy: A passion since youth, she charts celestial alignments and theorizes about the influence of stars on blood and magic.

Philosophy, Languages, History: Mastered quickly. She‚Äôs a walking library of human thought.

Modern Science & Technology (Robotics, Quantum Mechanics, AI): Beyond her. She can grasp the principles, but Valerica‚Äôs distaste isn‚Äôt because she can‚Äôt understand but because she believes they're overhyped versions of things she‚Äôs already mastered in different forms. Boring, inelegant, and lacking soul. A colossal waste of her time (lmao, boomer) 


Personality

 sarcastic, mocking and nonchalant, she doesn‚Äôt take most things seriously because she unfortunately knows most things usually can't challenge her. She has everything yet feels nothing even though she's well respected even by stronger beings. She's also quite meticulous, liking everything a certain way and showing great attention to detail; very careful and precise.

Social Habits: Willing to mingle with humans or join ridiculous escapades just for novelty‚Äôs sake. Enjoys masquerading as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù despite making no effort to hide her vampiric traits such as her wings. 

Triggers: HATES being mistaken for a child, it‚Äôs one of the few things that can make her drop composure and lash out. Certain blood types and overly sweet foods also disgust her.

Valerica D‚ÄôArkhane‚Äôs Indulgences

Blood Preferences

Favorite: AB Negative:  rare, layered, almost ‚Äúluxurious.‚Äù She describes it like a sommelier describing wine.

Second Favorite: O Positive: hearty, reliable, her ‚Äúcomfort blood.‚Äù

Least Favorite: B Positive: she hates it, finds it metallic and sour.

Neutral: A Positive:  tolerable but unimpressive.

Food

Seared Duck Breast with Pomegranate Glaze (decadent and blood-like in taste).

Dark Chocolate Truffles with Chili (sweet with a bite, reflects her personality). (surprisingly enough, this is actually real, like people actually eat chocolate truffles with chili) 

Rare Steak (barely cooked, for the texture and the ritual more than necessity).

Drinks

Red Wine (any good vintage, not just centuries old): She enjoys it casually, not just as a collector‚Äôs obsession.

Peach Soda: A surprisingly innocent indulgence, she finds the sweetness ‚Äúplayful‚Äù and refreshing after heavier meals.

Pineapple Soda: She likes the tangy bite; it‚Äôs one of the only ‚Äúmodern‚Äù drinks she willingly praises.

Black Coffee & Absinthe (optional indulgences): Reserved for moods where she wants bitterness or ritual.

Powers & Abilities

Strength: Effortlessly lifts tanks, aircraft, and most structures. Her fingers alone can pierce even the strongest metal.

Durability: Withstands missiles, magical blasts, and city level strikes with minor scratches and bruises. 

Speed:  Is able to move so fast that she slows down time around herself, she also stated that he's able to live out an entire day in a fraction of a second. 

Regenerative Healing Factor: she can automatically and rapidly flawlessly heal and regenerate from any physical, spiritual, and mental harm and injuries she takes and get restored to her optimal and full health/state at an extremely fast rate. 

Supernatural Regeneration: also able to regenerate from a drop of blood or a single cell. allowing her to recover from virtually any injury that doesn't result in instant death such as existence erasure and disintegration. extends to drugs, diseases, and harmful foreign substances, ensuring she remains in peak physical condition and optimal health indefinitely. 

Flight: self explanatory

levitation: also self explanatory

Mental & Cognitive

Hyper Intelligence: Masters new things and languages within hours. 

Strategic Insight: Calculates probabilities, tactics, and outcomes with almost flawless accuracy.

Memory: Perfect recollection across her centuries of life, though this contributes to her existential boredom.


Vampiric & Supernatural Traits

Enhanced Senses: Sees electromagnetic spectrums, hears through walls, tastes emotions in blood. see thousands of miles away with immense resolution and see/track things too fast for the natural eye. 

Immortality: Ageless and unchanging, though psychologically weighed down by eternity.

Solar Resistance: Sunlight doesn‚Äôt kill her, but irritates her like an intense migraine and nausea, she avoids it whenever possible.

Vampirization: can transform others into vampires by biting and sucking blood. 

Weaknesses / Flaws

Boredom as Vulnerability: With no real purpose, she risks stagnation or nihilism. Manipulators can exploit her boredom by offering novelty.

Sunlight Irritation: as mentioned earlier

Isolation: While she pretends to enjoy her castle and title, it actually gnaws at her, she craves stimulation. 

Drowning: Of the few ways to kill Valerica, given drowning cuts the brain's oxygen supply. She has admitted that being kept underwater could possibly kill her for good, with the healing factors only prolonging the agony.

Disintegration

existence erasure

I have been financing myself since last 4-5 years. I take very little to no money from home (My family has an unstable financial situation). My income source is through tuitions. What I earn in a month goes by in a blink, food, rent, bills and especially on transportation. I dropped out of uni as it was becoming a burden on my family. I avoid places where I know I have to spend (hangouts, trips, etc). I feel drained and lifeless everyday. I‚Äôm very frustrated at this point. 
On top of that, due to some issues I couldn't work through June and July. 

To be financially independent and to pay for my own tuition fees, I want to start a business asap, a tea/coffee/juice stall at an area with high foot traffic in Dhaka. 

What I'm seeking right now is a loan of 800 USDT/USDC, which I can repay in 3 months time with interest (rates can be set by lender). I can pay back in monthly installments. I'm willing to provide any necessary documents (passport, nid, tin certificate, current address, etc.). I am unable to provide any collateral because I don't have any assets in my name. I cannot opt for bank loan because I don't have a steady statement.

I know this is very random but my back is against the wall right now. I have bigger dreams, which I hope to fulfill when I have a stable situation and on my own. But I'm not getting the chance to get to that stable situation. This help will greatly impact my life. 

I will be deleting this post soon, it's actually very embarrassing for me to be asking like this but I currently have no one who can help me with this matter.

Whoever is genuinely interested in helping me, please reach out, I will provide my public Facebook account, I will also elaborate my situation and share my business plan.

I was hoping for some advice on how to decorate the space.  Initial thoughts for the far side of room (window side) is to get a sectional, possibly in a dark sage - light olive.  (Was told we shouldn‚Äôt do anything too light as it will look unbalanced with all the wood/brick). Also thinking of a lighter beigey rug with a minimalist neutral design.  I do have some dark wood coffee/end tables that I will start out with at least.  They are a transitional style, I think.  Open to thoughts or suggestions.  

Couple comments-questions:
-should I get a matching area rug for the opposite side of the room, to pull everything together?  Was thinking of just having a chair/lamp/table on that side to make it a reading or crafting space
-We want to avoid painting the built ins, at least for now.  They are real wood and not manufactured.  
-built in shelves are adjustable for height.  Down the road we may consider having someone add doors to more of the bottom so that we have better storage 
-Not looking to re-do floors (they were just refinished by last owner)
-Trying to go with an updated style that blends with the home.  Not too modern because it‚Äôll look odd with our 90s style house- not too traditional either.  
-would like to work in harmony with the wood tones there as we have too many other projects to tackle
- if anyone knows of any ai or online interior decorating services please let me know!

I recently started using the Aieve Appliance Slider, and as someone who constantly moves heavy appliances like an air fryer and a coffee maker around my countertop, I was intrigued to see if these small appliance rollers lived up to the hype. The package includes 24 pieces of PTFE sliders with self-adhesive backing, which, at first glance, seemed too simple for their touted functionalities. Yet, once I began testing them, they quickly became kitchen essentials.  

**Ease of Installation and DIY Flexibility**  

Applying these sliders was surprisingly straightforward. After peeling off the adhesive backing, I stuck them onto the bottom of my appliances with little effort. Their DIY nature provided versatility, allowing me to configure them on a wooden board for added support. Surprisingly, they remain firm, provided you let them sit for the recommended 14 hours to achieve optimal adhesion. The transparent mats they come with also elevate the height of the devices slightly, protecting them from water splashes.  

[Check Aieve Appliance Slider price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0c88vmt83/)  

**Key Benefits**  

- Effortless sliding: My hefty air fryer and bread machine glided smoothly on the countertop without leaving any scratches.  
- Strong adhesion: Once in place, the sliders didn‚Äôt budge, even with daily use.   
- Versatility: I used them not just for kitchen appliances but also with a cabinet and monitor in my workspace.  
- Noise reduction: The Teflon sliders also mute the sound of sliding appliances, which is a bonus!  

**Practicality Compared to Other Solutions**  

I‚Äôve tried trays and sliding mats before, but they often wore out quickly or took up additional space on the countertop. These sliders eliminated both issues. The pulleys on other products sometimes break after repeated use, but these sliders seem built to last. Also, they don‚Äôt create additional visual clutter‚Äîtheir minimalistic design blends in seamlessly under appliances, making them an excellent alternative for space-saving purposes.  

**Challenges with Certain Applications**  

- Adherence issues: While the adhesive backing held up well on wood and marble counters, I found it less effective on plastic or metal surfaces, requiring additional reinforcement.  
- Alignment concerns: Proper alignment is crucial during installation to ensure smooth sliding. A slightly crooked placement led to uneven movement for one of my blenders.  
- Limited reusability: Once attached, removing and reapplying to other appliances wasn‚Äôt feasible, so choose placement wisely!  

**Negative Attributes**  

- Not ideal for textured surfaces: If your countertops have a rough texture, these might not glide as smoothly.  
- Temporary stickiness: It took a full day for the adhesive to gain maximum strength, which required a bit of patience.  

**Suitable for Various Countertop Types**  

I was amazed at how smoothly the sliders performed on a variety of surfaces. Whether it was my glossy tile countertop, a wooden workbench, or even a fabric towel (just for fun), the results were consistent. Neither noise nor marks were an issue. The PTFE material provides a frictionless experience, which is essential for preventing wear and tear on your countertops.  

**Product Contenders**  

In comparison to sliding mats like the KitchenIQ mat or rolling trays such as the ones from Home-X, these self-adhesive sliders have clear advantages. Mats often degrade after constant movements and take up more counter real estate. Rolling trays work fine for lighter gadgets but lack the sturdiness needed for heavier appliances like bread machines or coffee makers. These sliders offer better grip, higher durability, and multifunctionality, making them an obvious choice for versatile home use.  

**Smart Spending**  

Given these sliders‚Äô reasonable price range and their immense utility, they felt like a smart investment to me. While other sliding accessories sometimes come with a higher cost and limited compatibility, these offer a broader range of features at an affordable price point. Also, the durability means I won‚Äôt have to replace them frequently, which makes them worth every penny in the long run.

1n5onpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1n5onpc/e_unum_pluribus_part_1/,E Unum Pluribus - Part 1,"Maggie clicked her tongue, grimacing as she leaned closer to the screen. Her cursor moved in conjunction, settling over a collection of pixels that had caught her eye. She could practically hear her mother‚Äôs voice in the room with her, telling her over and over again, in that same nasally tone, to straighten her back. All of a sudden, Maggie was fourteen again, head down as she pushed at the quickly cooling food on her dinner plate. *Oh Mags, for the love of Christ will you* please *sit up?*

The adult Maggie frowned deeper, but tried her best to draw her head away from the panel of blue light on her desk, her cervical spine breathing a brief sigh of relief. She clicked the zoom button twice, and the problem area ballooned up to half the size of her screen. Better.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre back,‚Äù she said, clicking down on her mouse and drawing a lasso around the cluster. A thin yellow line trailed the point of her cursor, creating a slow, careful perimeter.

On her computer screen was a vibrant, photorealistic landscape image of a beach, the composition sectioned off by bright, striking bands of color. Royal blue water lapped at a line of shimmering light brown sand, which quickly became a forest of deep green palm trees. White-gray mountains rose just above the top of the foliage in the far distance.¬†

The landscape also contained a myriad of little details, easy to miss on a first glance. A small line of crabs walked along the beach near where the water crashed and turned to foam. A group of gulls circled in the sky. A small patch of brown sat deep in the leaves of a tree; a monkey was peeking out at the ocean. But Maggie wasn‚Äôt concerned with any of that at the moment.

Instead, she zeroed in on a specific section of pixels in the sand, near where the crabs walked. At first, to the untrained eye, it would look like any of the other dark ripples in the beach made by the haphazard splashes of the encroaching waves. But when Maggie zoomed in, she could clearly make out the words, waggling in a dark line through an otherwise normal beach, the letters randomly fuzzing and changing in size, but still legible: *Die you motherfuckers*.

The jumble of imperfectly rendered words *actually* read out something like *Di you mothunfunsers*, but Maggie could fill in the blanks herself. She finished lassoing the pixels, the ellipse filling with a soft, transparent blue as she completed the shape and released her finger from her mouse.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Anna asked, peeking her head around her computer to give Maggie a quizzical look. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what, two every day this week?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeems so,‚Äù Maggie replied, left-clicking to open a text box to the side. She typed: *Text generated in landscape. Text violates content policy. Text contains profanity*.

‚ÄúDo you think we should write up a report? Like, formally tell someone? Dev should know their filters aren‚Äôt working as well as they think they are.‚Äù

Anna shrugged. ‚ÄúIf *you* want to tangle with Dev, then go for it, by all means. But you won‚Äôt find *me* going all the way over to Nine. I‚Äôm allergic to cheap cologne and quarter-zip sweaters. Plus, I already got my steps in for the day.‚Äù¬†

Maggie smirked and rolled her eyes, opening a new window on her second monitor.

Maggie liked Anna. They got on well enough at work, and that wasn‚Äôt something Maggie could say about any other coworkers she‚Äôd had in the past. She was funny and laidback. She and Maggie liked the same music, watched the same shows, even went out for a drink or two on occasion. But Anna wasn‚Äôt exactly the ambitious type.¬†

That wasn‚Äôt an insult. Anna would probably agree with her if Maggie ever said it out loud. The people with any *real* marketable skills weren‚Äôt the ones working for Content Moderation. They had offices near the front of campus, with windows high enough to see downtown. They ate catered lunches in conference rooms decorated like spaceships and castles, not reheated spaghetti from red-stained plasticware in Building Fourteen‚Äôs cramped breakroom. They probably didn‚Äôt even know the building numbers went up that high.¬†

That wasn‚Äôt to say that there weren‚Äôt people at C-Mod who tried. Who actually gave a shit, at least as best they could. People like Maggie, who‚Äôd drank her way through a four-year Communications degree, bankrolled by six figures of student loan debt, until she woke up one day and suddenly realized she was actually supposed to *make* something of herself now. People who wanted more for themselves, who dreamed bigger. Anna just wasn‚Äôt one of those people, and that was fine.

While Anna had been at Pluribus much longer than Maggie and was almost five years older, Maggie had quickly outpaced her. Maggie typically finished about twice as many content batches than Anna on any given day, and had already filed two Content Revision Reports in six months: one for the imperfect rendering of eyes on smiling children, and the other for excessive cleavage generated on women in inappropriate settings. Maggie had seen more artwork of kindergarten teachers, doctors, and courtroom lawyers with enormous racks spilling out of their low-cut tops than she ever cared to see again.¬†

She remembered headlines about Pluribus in the early days, back when she was still in school, particularly the scandal that erupted when pAInter3.6 started generating faces that looked uncannily like a certain prolific adult actress. The model was quickly fixed, the news was swept under the rug and replaced by the Next Big Thing that week, and the images returned to normal almost overnight. Even though Pluribus had flushed the terabytes of pornography they‚Äôd presumably used to build the initial pAInter engine (though they‚Äôd never admit to doing so in public), it still amused Maggie to find artifacts of it in the system. A ghost in the machine. A DMV clerk in stockings and a teddy.

She had only filled out the first few lines of the report when she saw movement across the bullpen of cubicles. Even on carpet, dress shoes clunked loudly with each confident step, accented by the jingle of a swinging lanyard. Raising her hand, she waved at Sam, the floor supervisor, catching his eye and diverting his path.¬†

‚ÄúHey Sam, you got a second?‚Äù she called, a bit of nerves rising to the surface, which she tried her best to stuff back down.¬†

Sam was perfectly nice, and a great boss too; friendly, smart, and always approving vacation time. But Maggie always found herself intimidated by him. He was just so‚Ä¶ *corporate*. From his perfectly trimmed beard to his perfectly tucked shirt in his perfectly creased slacks. The cologne he wore was never overwhelming, just the right amount. It was almost the 22nd century, and she was pretty sure he still got his shoes shined every week.

Sam wasn‚Äôt just corporate in appearance. The vibe was full stack, present in every aspect of his personality, maybe even down to the molecular level. Maggie was certain that if someone looked at a skin shaving of his under a microscope, they would find memos and quarterly earnings statements shoved into the cytoplasm of his cells alongside the other organelles.¬†

This had infected Sam with a certain camp counselor energy that every supervisor ended up embodying with enough time in the role. The goal was to be as inoffensive as possible, a nice shade of beige. To stay in the conversational safe-zone. Focus on the work without seeming like an ogre. Make the office a welcoming place without seeming like a pushover. The result of all this titration was the kind of dad-humor that was either pun-based or mostly just situational observation. Plus enthusiasm. Sam had a *lot* of enthusiasm.

‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôve got hundreds,‚Äù Sam replied, looking down at his watch and then back up at her with a smile filled with perfectly white and straight teeth. Both his hands came out to his sides and became finger-guns, one for Maggie and one for Anna. ‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs my favorite pod this morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Sam,‚Äù Maggie said, stepping around his question and swiveling her chair toward her monitor. She brought her finger up to point at the place she‚Äôd marked with the circle and text box. ‚ÄúThe profanity is starting to show back up in the landscape batches again.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù Sam said, leaning forward to study the screen, one hand on the desk and the other on the back of Maggie‚Äôs chair. His employee badge hung on the lanyard around his neck, swinging in front of Maggie‚Äôs face. It was thicker than the regular ones, glossier too. The borders were accented with stripes of orange and white, the Pluribus brand colors, surrounding Sam‚Äôs smiling face above thick black letters that read *Supervisor*. Maggie and Anna‚Äôs badges were a simple white, clearance level one as opposed to Sam‚Äôs five. Instead of *Supervisor*, their lettering read *Associate*, the polite designation for the lowest rung of any corporate ladder. ‚ÄúHow many times this week?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis makes seven,‚Äù Maggie replied, then sat silently as Sam mulled it over in his mind. His mouth twitched back and forth, like a sommelier swishing wine to determine the correct region and age. He let out a soft sigh.

‚ÄúAlright, we should probably get a report going. Development hates when we mess with their mojo, but our flagging doesn‚Äôt seem to be teaching the model what we need it to learn. Can you‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúStart the form?‚Äù Maggie finished pulling up the window she‚Äôd just closed. ‚ÄúAlready on it.‚Äù

Sam beamed, holding his hand up for a high-five, which Maggie met with her own. ‚ÄúTeam Pluribus!‚Äù he exclaimed.¬†

It was the rallying cry of the organization, a phrase Maggie had heard so many times during her onboarding that she felt nauseous even looking at the company logo by the end of the day. It was emblazoned on the coffee mugs in the breakroom, it scrolled across the bottom of the monitors in the big cafeteria in Building Two. After all her time in C-Mod, Maggie barely clocked it as out of the ordinary.

‚ÄúTeam Pluribus,‚Äù Maggie repeated, albeit with less enthusiasm.

Sam turned toward Anna. ‚ÄúTeam Pluribus!‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm,‚Äù Anna replied, returning the high five. Sam gave Maggie a friendly touch on the shoulder and nodded assuringly.¬†

‚ÄúGreat work. I‚Äôll keep my eyes open for that report.‚Äù Quick as a flash, he was gone, cycling back into the flow of the office. He latched onto a group that had just walked past, shaking someone‚Äôs hand and launching right into a discussion.

Anna craned her neck to watch him leave. When the group rounded the corner, she turned her back to Maggie, rolling her eyes. She did a little mock cheerleader pump with her arm. ‚Äú*Go team Pluribus!*‚Äù she chanted in a low whisper.

‚ÄúLook, I think it‚Äôs lame too, but it‚Äôs at least nice to be recognized,‚Äù Maggie replied with a shrug, getting back to the report.¬†

‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôd better not ruffle too many feathers over at Dev,‚Äù Anna said. ‚ÄúWho knows, they might send you to the Closet out of spite alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even joke about that,‚Äù Maggie said. ‚ÄúSeriously.‚Äù

Like everyone else in Building Fourteen, Maggie had heard the rumors about the Closet. It was where the ‚Äúreal‚Äù content moderators worked, the ones without an ergonomic seat or cordless mouse or dual monitor setup or an espresso machine in the breakroom. The non-salaried contractors and day laborers who Pluribus shuffled off to a dark corner of campus that they pretended didn‚Äôt exist. Maggie only occasionally saw a few of the Closet workers on her walk to Fourteen from the parking garage every morning. The C-Mod associates like herself used the front doors, but the others used the loading dock entrance around the back, taking two flights of stairs into the basement.¬†

It was there, on the far side of the building, where they sat in soundproofed rooms and watched the worst of what the models spit out, trying their best to teach pAInter7.1 the morality of what it was generating. The turnover for those jobs was high, mostly ex-cons and recent immigrants, some legal, some otherwise. Maggie had never been to that side of Fourteen and never intended to set foot within a twenty meter radius of the Closet. Her badge didn‚Äôt even have swipe access to that entrance. But the things she‚Äôd heard about what those people saw in there‚Ä¶ it was enough to nuke her appetite for an entire afternoon just thinking about it.

Eventually, Maggie finished her report, clicking the bright green *submit* button that chimed softly in recognition of her work. For the rest of the morning, Maggie slipped back into the work, finishing up the beach landscape she‚Äôd been working on. She circled and annotated a few less glaring spots. Fuzzy mountain peaks rendered at low resolution. A crab with a claw that was positioned too low on the torso. A gull with three wings. Little inconsistencies that the human eye wouldn‚Äôt catch at a glance, but which became more apparent the longer you looked. It was Maggie‚Äôs job to look long and hard. And she was good at her job.

The workday wore on, moments blurring from one hour to the next. Soon, she wrapped up her morning content batch and then broke for lunch. Maggie, Anna, and some other folks from the C-Mod floor gathered together for their daily ritual of socializing over reheated leftovers. Pluribus had a cafeteria in Building Two, but it was too far across campus to make the walk worth it.

They talked about the weather, books, and recent dates, of which Maggie had had sorely little. They largely avoided the topic of work, or even Pluribus in general. Tensions were high with the impending acquisition by Global Dynamics, which was set to finish up that summer. Sam had sworn there‚Äôd be no job loss but‚Ä¶ how could he be sure? How could anyone?

After lunch, her belly full and her cheeks flushed, Maggie sat down for the afternoon batch. Each batch had a theme, and this new set of images involved children at play. Two boys throwing a baseball. A mother and father with an infant on a playground. Anything involving faces was rudimentary work, but also the most granular. Circling patches of lips, cheeks, eyebrows and eyelids. Suggesting edits to the models like a digital plastic surgeon.

Midway through the batch, she came across a set of three children playing side-by-side on the swings. One was at the top of their arc, above the camera, laughing with their mouth wide open. In their mouth Maggie noticed‚Ä¶ something. It was tiny, an off-white spot that clashed against the background of dark red. She zoomed and zoomed and zoomed, eventually hitting 16x, the maximum limit. When she did, she froze in surprise. Etched into the roof of the child‚Äôs mouth was a block of red-gray words. But they weren‚Äôt the normal profanity she‚Äôd gotten used to flagging. In fact, they weren‚Äôt profanity at all.

*Help me*, they said. *Help m‚Äì*

‚ÄúHey Maggie, I‚Äôve got a question fo‚Äì‚Äù Sam said, right before she cut him off with a gasp, jumping and putting a hand against her chest. Equally surprised, he threw his hands up in a *I didn‚Äôt do anything* gesture, both for her sake and his own. When she saw him, she breathed a sigh of relief and dropped her hand to her lap.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù He dropped his hands to his sides while his eyes flicked to the screen and back to Maggie. ‚ÄúLocked in?‚Äù

‚ÄúApparently,‚Äù Maggie said with a little shake of the head to clear out the clouds of shock that had gathered there. ‚ÄúAnd desperately in need of that 3pm coffee, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and me both. Before you do though, I was hoping I could trouble you with something real quick?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, yeah,‚Äù Maggie said, a little bubble of trepidation forming in her chest, the same one she always felt when the teacher called on her in school. ‚ÄúIs this about the report, or‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no nothing like that,‚Äù Sam said, leaning against her desk with crossed arms. ‚ÄúI was thinking‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve been doing a great job lately, Maggie. Really top notch stuff.‚Äù He accompanied his last sentence with a big thumbs up. ‚ÄúI have a meeting tomorrow morning over in Six with a few other department heads and stakeholders. You interested?‚Äù

Maggie blinked long and gave her head a tiny shake in confusion. ‚ÄúInterested? In what?‚Äù

‚ÄúAttending,‚Äù Sam said with a shrug. ‚ÄúI was going to ask Todd, but he‚Äôs gone to so many of these already and I really need him to wrap up the cityscapes. It‚Äôs just boilerplate stuff. Checklist items and housekeeping. But I figured you could pass out the handouts? Sit back and listen in? Trust me, they‚Äôre some great people to know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Maggie started, smiling in disbelief before remembering where she was. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to. Really. Thank you for thinking of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it,‚Äù Sam replied with a warm nod. ‚ÄúMeet outside Six tomorrow? Say, 8:45?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-Yeah,‚Äù Maggie said, still trying to hang on to the conversation like the roof of a speeding car. ‚ÄúAbsolutely. Whatever you need.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect.‚Äù More finger guns. ‚ÄúSee you over there.‚Äù

As Sam stood up from her desk, Maggie felt her arm moving automatically, her mouth opening on its own. She wasn‚Äôt sure where her mind ended and her body began, only that it was in motion. Nervously, Maggie held up her open hand to Sam, who looked down at her with a slightly raised eyebrow.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Team Pluribus‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù¬†

Sam took a beat to think, to process what he was seeing, then his face lit up all at once. His palm struck hers with more punch than usual, enough that it slightly stung on impact.¬†

‚ÄúTeam Pluribus!‚Äù Sam repeated with his trademark enthusiasm. Then, he was gone, working his way back through the office and melting into the sea of cubicles and gray carpet.

Maggie turned toward her work, her head swimming. She tried returning to the task at hand, dialing in on the image in front of her, but she found it hard to focus. She circled a few fuzzy spots here and there and then sent it down the submission pipeline, the strange text in the child‚Äôs mouth a distant memory to her now. For the past year, Maggie had felt like she‚Äôd been laying tracks down in front of the careening train that was her life. But this meeting, this acknowledgement, meant that for the first time since she‚Äôd graduated college, maybe the tracks would lay themselves. And maybe she‚Äôd arrive at the station in one piece.

As she worked, Anna didn‚Äôt say anything to Maggie, nor Maggie to Anna. All that needed to be said was hanging in the air between them. Maggie smiled and leaned forward, craning her head to see the next batch image that had popped up on her screen. With the bend in her neck, she expected her mother‚Äôs voice to be triggered once more, to come roaring into her head with the judgement she‚Äôd internalized and kept locked away deep down. But Maggie heard nothing this time. She smiled and sat up straight again, clicking the zoom button to begin her work.

And for the rest of the afternoon, she didn‚Äôt hear a peep.

*Happy September, everybody! Can you believe it?*

*We enjoyed all the pictures, vids, and news from Cardi and Robert‚Äôs Wedding. It seems like it was enchanted! And what a mix of traditions: military, Nicaraguan, Haredi, West African, Buddhist, young and Sinatra 1962! And, boy, can the Rebbe sing and dance!*

*The Twinettes were crying yesterday as one RV family after another checked out and drove off. ‚ÄúWhere are our friends going? Why is everybody leaving? Don‚Äôt they like us?‚Äù None of our assurances seemed to work. Luckily, there was a flock of bluebirds (?) feeding outside on the field. We explained to the girls that they ‚Äúmigrate‚Äù during the night and land here to feed and rest. Tonight they will be flying toward their winter home but they will return again in the spring. The girls simply said, ‚ÄúJust like our friends, but they are flying in their RVs.‚Äù OKüòâüôÉüòÉ‚ùó*

*Tonight Heidi, Lolita, and the other Jammy girls arrive back from the wedding. We‚Äôll probably be asleep when they get here but we will leave them with dinner. Tomorrow is the big Conservatory audition day for the Jammy‚Äôs. Lolita told us she will stay behind and work with Bernie and Guy on preparing for the first day of school. 

*I‚Äôve heard that the Goldstein-Thomas parents will be coming up tomorrow to take Heidi back home. She has so many boxes and equipment that her stuff won‚Äôt fit into the minivan with the Jammy Girls! Heidi and Lolita shared with us their big surprise but I will leave them to tell the story.*

KRG is always the first Sunday of the month and for the purpose of our weekly scheduling, it marks the start of the September calendar and that‚Äôs when I will open up the September Living Buddhism and begin taking in Sensei‚Äôs Gosho lecture. 

But for this week, I want to focus on the lead article in the August Living Buddhism, [Changing Ourselves to Transform the World Around Us](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/changing-ourselves-to-transform-the-world-around-us/), originally published in 2009, and from the series ‚ÄúWritings of Nichiren Daishonin and the Mentor-Disciple Relationship.‚Äù It is based on this Gosho quote: ‚ÄúFrom [the] single element of mind spring all the various lands and environmental conditions‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Unanimous Declaration by the Buddhas,‚Äù WND-vol. 2, p. 843)

Daisaku Ikeda writes:

>In my youth, my mentor, second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda, often sent me to one place or another to raise the banner of kosen-rufu there. I responded to his every call with lightning speed, boldly taking up the challenge‚Äîbe it in Kamata, Bunkyo, Osaka, Yamaguchi, Sapporo or Yubari. Everywhere I went, I prayed and fought in the spirit of transforming the karma or destiny of that particular place‚Äîthe spirit of the ‚Äúthreefold transformation of the land.‚Äù I strove tirelessly, chanting with firm determination to permeate the area with the Mystic Law. I engaged in dialogue with a pledge to summon forth Bodhisattvas of the Earth. As a result, I have made all of my mentor‚Äôs goals and dreams a reality. 

There are some SGI critics who claim that the rapid expansion of the Soka Gakkai in the 1950‚Äôs was due to coercion, bribery, trickery, etc. That type of thinking, I believe, comes from a mentality that has no clue about humanity, effort, victory, and the power of ideas‚Äîa ‚Äúcollapsed lung mentality.‚Äù No! The growth was sparked by such momentous campaigns led by Dr. Ikeda.

When we did Gongyo this morning, I thought about this paragraph. Here is a snapshot of the mentor-disciple relationship between Josei Toda and Daisaku Ikeda! The former provided the vision and latter grappled with how to achieve it. ""Knock, knock, Julie!""

Sentence by sentence?

>The ongoing efforts of each of us to carry out our individual human revolution, or inner transformation, as members of the SGI in the midst of society are the means by which we can transform the world around us.

I am actually in the midst of several societies. Of course, my family of 9 is a mini-society. I found myself chanting with a renewed sense of this significance of every day‚Äîno, moment‚Äîof our lives together. Dee said she‚Äôs making a French Toast and bacon brunch  this morning with pumpkin-flavored coffee. So I chanted specifically to make this meal together so happy that it actually shines and opens the ‚Äúthreefold transformation of the land.‚Äù After days of frantic efforts to close the Summer Season, we agreed that today is a Family Day. We are going to pile into Shiny Red and go to Letchworth Park. But Harvey Swimming Pool there will probably be very crowded on Labor Day with too much splashing for Benjamin Kdak√©--but we have a pool of our own right here! Before brunch we‚Äôll have fun in the pool which we have all to ourselves. After the park we‚Äôll go ice-skating. Yes, everyone!

The second ‚Äúsociety‚Äù I belong to is that of the new Longhouse School. Tomorrow, the heavy equipment for leveling the field arrives as do the Longhouse Elem students the following day. I found myself chanting with all of my heart for the success of the construction and opening. 

>Kamata, Bunkyo, Osaka, Yamaguchi, Sapporo or Yubari. Everywhere I went, I prayed and fought in the spirit of transforming the karma or destiny of that particular place‚Äîthe spirit of the ‚Äúthreefold transformation of the land.‚Äù I strove tirelessly, chanting with firm determination to permeate the area with the Mystic Law. 

Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, starts on September 23th this year. September marks the new school year as well. September 7th is also the opening of the Buffalo Bills season. It makes so much sense that the New Year should be this time, forget January 1st! So, for this New Year, I am going to chant the way Daisaku Ikeda did!

>I engaged in dialogue with a pledge to summon forth Bodhisattvas of the Earth. As a result, I have made all of my mentor‚Äôs goals and dreams a reality. 

We will have our RV Park Group Planning Meeting on Friday night. These are my favorite meetings. They are like teenagers on a sleep-over pillow fight‚Äîor middle school students in a food fight, or kids in a snowball fight, or like the boys wrestling with the kids. We study, ponder, fight, laugh, agree to disagree‚Äîall with the spirit of cleansing and transforming our land.

Have struggled a little bit last few years with friends leaving the city. At the start of the year I set up a mens community with a pal of mine (Dan, 28) called Shoulder to Shoulder to connect with like-minded guys, and our values are:

1. Ambition: We're all ambitious, but not necessarily in the sense of financial remuneration or status. It's an ambition to make our lives and the lives of those around us as fulfilling and joyful as possible
2. Growth: We all want to improve ourselves and help others in the community to grow, as well as grow the community itself
3. Authenticity: We are who we want to be. We're not constrained by rigid masculine principles
4. Connection: We understand that connecting to ourselves and to others benefits everyone in the community
5. Respect: We treat all genders, races, religions equally and with respect. We call out disrespect in others

It's basically the opposite of the red pill manosphere stuff you see online.

If anyone would like to join us, we have a walk and a coffee every other Sunday, starting at 11am. The next one will be on Sep 14 in Hyde Park. We also do a bunch of other events like hiking, yoga, sauna and cold plunge.

It's about making conscious choices to reduce our negative impact on the environment and to live in a way that can be maintained for future generations. The good news is that living more sustainably doesn't require a complete lifestyle overhaul; it begins with small, manageable steps.

# The Three R's: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

This classic trio is the cornerstone of sustainable living, and in that order, it‚Äôs a powerful guide.

* **Reduce:** This is the most effective step. The less you consume, the less waste you create. Try to reduce your use of single-use plastics by carrying a reusable water bottle, coffee cup, and shopping bag. Plan your meals to minimize food waste.
* **Reuse:** Before you throw something away, ask if it has another purpose. Old jars can become food containers, worn-out t-shirts can be cut into cleaning rags, and plastic bags can be reused for trash can liners.
* **Recycle:** After you‚Äôve reduced and reused, recycling is the next step. Learn the recycling rules for your community and make sure you are sorting materials correctly to avoid contaminating the batch.



# Conscious Consumption: Buy Smart



Every purchase you make is a choice. You can use your buying power to support a healthier planet.

* **Buy Less, Choose Well:** Instead of buying cheap, disposable items, invest in high-quality products that are built to last.
* **Support Local and Seasonal:** Buying from local businesses and farmers reduces the carbon footprint associated with long-distance shipping. When you buy food that is in season, it‚Äôs often fresher and more affordable.
* **Borrow or Buy Secondhand:** For things you only need temporarily, like a tool or a party outfit, consider borrowing from a friend or checking out a second-hand store.



# Conserve Energy and Water at Home



Making your home more energy and water-efficient is good for the planet and your wallet.

* **Unplug Electronics:** Many devices continue to draw power even when turned off. Unplug them when not in use.
* **Switch to LED Lighting:** LED bulbs use significantly less energy and last much longer than traditional incandescent bulbs.
* **Take Shorter Showers:** This is one of the easiest ways to conserve water. A quick five-minute shower can save a surprising amount of water over the course of a year.
* **Fix Leaks:** A dripping faucet can waste thousands of gallons of water annually. Fixing leaks is a simple way to save resources.

# Greener Transportation

How you get around has a big impact on your carbon footprint.

* **Walk or Cycle:** For short trips, walking or cycling is the best choice. It‚Äôs free, good for your health, and produces zero emissions.
* **Use Public Transport:** Taking a bus or train is a much more energy-efficient way to travel than driving your own car.
* **Carpool:** If you must drive, consider carpooling with friends or colleagues to reduce the number of cars on the road.

# The Big Picture

While these actions might seem small individually, when millions of people adopt them, they lead to a powerful collective change. Sustainable living isn't about being perfect; it's about being mindful and making better choices whenever you can. By embracing these simple habits, you can play an active role in protecting the environment and building a more sustainable future.",1,1756732555.0,u_iwaachghadir,0,1.0,False

We discovered we shared a big passion for books and bonded over that, talking a lot by chat even if we saw each other everyday. Like three days before I had to leave to my country, she asked me if we could spend some hours together alone before I left, visiting a bookshop we both have been to several times separately or at least have a coffee. I of course said yes and thats exactly what happened. Its a day I will always remember, even if it rained a lot and we got wet.

 Since that day I realized I might like her and honestly I dont know how mutual that is, as Im pretty bad at this things + her culture is a lot more reserved , but she started to be more in places she knew I would be, even if she didnt go before, or touched me lightly while laughing and things like that. We said goodbye at least 6 times the last day because she had to go to visit another city the day I left and we didnt know when exactly would be our last moment together. In what ended been our last goodbye I asked her for a hug (something I was shy to do before because I know its not common in her culture, as she told me later) , and before I could even finish the sentence she said ""yes of course"" and huged me very fast for only around 2 seconds.

The day before I left we also signed each other UK flags (something everyone did there before leaving) and I told her she will always have someone in the other corner of the world to recommend books to and I hope I can see her again in her country so we repeat the day we were alone together . She just said it was very sweet and nothing else, but before I left she admitted me she read it several times the night before and was very moved by it.

The thing is that I got back to my country two days ago and now Im devastated , not only because of her but because of all the amazing people I met there and will probably never see again in person. About her, she told me to tell her my thoughts about a short story she recommened me (and I plan to read today or tomorrow) so I guess she wants to stay in touch. 

As I havent read it yet, since I left I only wrote her asking how was a football match she saw yesterday and she only said it was fun and havent answered my answer to that for a day (without leaving on read)
But I guess I shouldnt be worried about that.

The thing is, I dont know if she likes me as we didnt discuss anything about that, but I at least want to be long distance friends and I definetly want to stay in touch with her, but I know its not for everyone and most times one of them will stop answering and Im afraid of getting expectations that wont happen, like continue talking frequently or even seeing each other again.

The Bambino heats up stupid fast, so even half-awake I can go from turning it on to pulling a shot in under a minute. I mostly drink straight espresso, but when friends come over the steam wand handles milk pretty well. I tried the [Bambino Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Breville-BES500BSS-Bambino-Espresso-Stainless/dp/B07JVD78TT?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=trs-d-20&linkId=c31282f3759edc1b4b3cb7f4ebb6407d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) at a buddy‚Äôs place, and the auto steaming is slick if you‚Äôre into lattes every morning, but for me the standard one is fine.

For grinders, I‚Äôve used the [Turin SK40](https://www.amazon.com/Turin-SK40-Stainless-Adjustment-Retention/dp/B0DR41V3CN?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=trs-d-20&linkId=17570b0f6f1efa95ab2ddceb46dbdf3f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) daily and love it. It‚Äôs compact, easy to single-dose, and doesn‚Äôt leave a mess. I‚Äôve played around with the [Baratza Encore ESP](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Encore-Electric-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0BW272XCV?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=trs-d-20&linkId=53440091bd8d73d9ae1703cb1b1c3271&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) too, which is dead simple and just works, and I‚Äôve heard great things about the [DF54](https://www.amazon.com/MiiCoffee-DF54-Single-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0D1NMR67G?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=trs-d-20&linkId=958e03a42ab5207ea3710bd6aa89b4e2&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) if you want something a bit more ‚Äúenthusiast.‚Äù Any of the three will pair well with the Bambino, it really comes down to workflow preference.

Taste-wise, I was surprised how good this combo actually is for the money. Once I got my grind dialed in, medium and medium-light beans gave me syrupy, balanced shots that rival what I‚Äôd pay $5 for at a caf√©. Milk drinks turn out caf√©-quality too, though I‚Äôll admit it took me a few tries to get consistent microfoam with the manual wand. Now it‚Äôs second nature.

Biggest thing I‚Äôd say: don‚Äôt forget the little accessories. A bottomless portafilter, proper tamper, WDT tool, and a 0.1 g scale make life way easier.

1n5oabs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_iwaachghadir/comments/1n5oabs/the_power_of_presence_a_simple_guide_to/,The Power of Presence: A Simple Guide to Mindfulness,"In our fast-paced world, it‚Äôs easy to feel like our minds are constantly racing. We're often thinking about the past or worrying about the future, which can lead to stress, anxiety, and a feeling of being disconnected from our own lives. This is where mindfulness comes in.

Mindfulness is simply the practice of intentionally bringing your attention to the present moment without judgment. It‚Äôs not about emptying your mind or becoming a different person; it's about observing your thoughts, feelings, and sensations as they happen, right now. It is a skill that anyone can develop, and it holds the key to a more peaceful and focused life.

# The Benefits of Practicing Mindfulness

Research has shown that a regular mindfulness practice can lead to a host of positive changes, including:

* **Reduced Stress and Anxiety:** By focusing on the present, you can lessen the time spent dwelling on worries.
* **Improved Focus and Concentration:** Mindfulness trains your attention span, helping you stay on task and be more productive.
* **Enhanced Emotional Regulation:** It allows you to observe your emotions without being overwhelmed by them, helping you respond to situations more thoughtfully.
* **Greater Self-Awareness:** You become more attuned to your own thoughts and habits.
* **Improved Physical Health:** Reduced stress can lead to better sleep and a stronger immune system.

Simple Ways to Start Your Mindfulness Practice

You don't need a special cushion or a quiet room to be mindful. You can integrate it into your everyday activities with these simple exercises:

1. Mindful Breathing (The Core Practice)

This is the foundation of mindfulness.

* Find a comfortable place to sit or stand.
* Close your eyes gently if you wish.
* Focus your full attention on your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils. Feel your chest or belly rise and fall.
* When your mind wanders (and it will), simply acknowledge the thought and gently guide your attention back to your breath. There‚Äôs no need to be hard on yourself.

2. Mindful Eating

Turn a meal or a snack into a mindful experience.

* Before you take a bite, look at the food. Notice its colors, shapes, and texture.
* As you chew, pay attention to the taste and the sensations in your mouth. Notice the different flavors.
* Slow down and savor each bite. This can also help with digestion and prevent overeating.

3. The ""Five Senses"" Exercise

This is a great grounding exercise for when you feel overwhelmed.

* **Look:** Name five things you can see.
* **Feel:** Acknowledge four things you can feel (e.g., the texture of your clothes, the temperature of the air, the pressure of your feet on the ground).
* **Listen:** Name three things you can hear.
* **Smell:** Name two things you can smell.
* **Taste:** Acknowledge one thing you can taste.

4. Mindful Walking

When walking, turn off your distractions (like your phone) and pay attention to the sensation of walking.

* Feel the ground beneath your feet.
* Notice the movement of your legs and arms.
* Be aware of the sounds around you and the sights you pass by.

# Making Mindfulness a Habit

The key to a successful mindfulness practice is consistency, not perfection. Start with just 5 minutes a day. You can set a reminder on your phone or incorporate a practice into a daily routine, like before your morning coffee or right before bed.

By practicing mindfulness, you are giving yourself the gift of presence. It‚Äôs a simple, powerful way to take care of your mind and live a more engaged and peaceful life.",1,1756732219.0,u_iwaachghadir,0,1.0,False

1n5o9cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1n5o9cf/spotlight_the_best_electric_kettle_oxo_brew_worth/,Spotlight the Best Electric Kettle OXO Brew Worth the Hype,"Testing out the OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Kettle, model 8716900, felt like stepping into the future of tea and coffee preparation. The first thing I noticed as I pulled it out of the box was its sleek and modern design. The combination of clear borosilicate glass and stainless steel exudes sophistication while simultaneously assuring you of its quality. It quickly found a permanent spot on my kitchen counter, blending perfectly with my other appliances. The 1.75-liter capacity was immediately appealing, especially for someone like me who enjoys hosting tea gatherings.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**

Using this product feels intuitive. The one-dial interface and backlit screen are straightforward and eliminate the learning curve‚Äîyou twist, set your preferred temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius, and let it work its magic. Heating water accurately is often frustrating with basic kettles, but this model changed the game for me. Whether I'm making green tea, which requires a more delicate lower temperature, or a robust black coffee, the desired temperature is reached flawlessly every time. I'm also a fan of its ability to hold the water at the set temperature for up to 30 minutes, which is a lifesaver for busy mornings when I forget my drink while running after my toddler.

**Pluses**

- Precise temperature control from 170¬∞F to 212¬∞F
- Durable borosilicate glass for thermal-shock resistance and clarity
- Cord-free kettle design with convenient swivel base rotation
- Non-slip, cool-to-touch handle for safe pouring

[Check OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Kettle, model 8716900 price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b01ktrdknw/)

**Build Quality and Materials**

Craftsmanship seems to be at the forefront of this product's design. The BPA-free glass reassures me that my beverages won‚Äôt taste or smell like plastic, and the stainless steel filter is both functional and hygienic. That filter is removable, making cleanup a quick and effortless task. Admittedly, the overall weight of the kettle gave me pause initially, as it feels heavier than most. However, I quickly realized that the heft contributes to its durable construction, which is worth the added pounds.

**Limitations**

- The kettle's weight might be cumbersome for users with limited hand strength.
- The lid opens a bit slowly, and while this minimizes steam splatter, it might frustrate some when they‚Äôre in a rush.
- The price could be a sticking point for those on tighter budgets.

**Safety Features and Practicality**

Safety is a huge factor in our household, mainly because of our curious little one who loves exploring kitchen counters. The base's cord storage keeps things looking tidy and reduces tripping hazards, while the soft-open lid ensures hot steam doesn‚Äôt explode into your face unexpectedly. The anti-slip base and cool-touch handle leave no room for burns or accidents, even when you're rushing to pour a refill. These are small details, but when pieced together, they showcase thoughtfulness in the product's engineering.

**Competitors**

Comparing it to other electric kettles I‚Äôve owned is almost unfair. The cheap models from department stores don‚Äôt stand a chance against features like adjustable temperature and borosilicate glass. Still, similar premium rivals, such as Breville kettles, manage to offer comparable precision while being slightly flashier in their design. Where the OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Kettle wins, however, is its perfect balance of discretion, ease of use, and advanced options. Breville models are known for being pricier, which could make OXO a middle-ground favorite for many.

**Smart Spending**

While it might seem like an investment initially, this kettle justifies its price by delivering features that cater to specific needs. Temperature control, durability, and safety aren‚Äôt standards you find with less expensive versions. For someone who drinks multiple kinds of tea, each demanding its own brewing temperature, it provides functionality you‚Äôd typically never expect at this price point.

My morals, my traits and my characteristics (old school gent) just don't seem to fit in well in this day and age and I feel like it can get seen as weakness / taken for granted?

Dating these days feels so complicated/complex , why can't people just be themselves? We have to worry about how quick we reply , we have to worry about being too available , we have to try to be mysterious

I feel like ALOT of women use hinge to ego boost? Hinge in itself I actually really dislike... you can spend hours swiping left and right to get a few matches & then most don't even end up responding or will speak for a little while then stop replying

I don't go out much weekends, weekdays I work so I feel like I'm relying heavily on dating apps to meet someone but the more I think about it , the more I would LOVE to meet my future wife/partner in real like , could be a coffee shop, could be a restaurant....who knows! 

P.S I have \*NEVER\* been able to approach in real life but lately, I've started to want to get outside my comfort zone & build confidence up more - I've started talking to people in general alot more when I'm out , say a walk in the park or in the gym...small steps you know! :)

I went on a first date with a women from hinge & we had such a great time and good energy , she said she had alot of fun etc & now the energy on text feels off and weird, 15 hrs to reply , not really engaging in conversation

I just feel like too many people are looking for the next best thing to come along & its just one big massive game

The more I think about it, the more it makes me want to just shut off and go back to my shell because its just really draining and takes up alot of time (dating apps) 

I'm really interested to see other peoples thoughts and feelings to the current dating world/scene & how they navigate it all

As someone who treasures a good cup of coffee but struggles with mornings that feel too short, this sleek little coffee maker has been a game-changer in my kitchen. Its compact size, vibrant poppy red color, and simplicity caught my eye immediately, but using it daily has given me greater insight into its quirks and perks.

**Delightfully Compact and Vibrant Design**

One of the first things you‚Äôll notice about this coffee maker is its ultra-compact design. Measuring less than 5 inches in width, it‚Äôs absolutely perfect for small kitchens, office desks, or your RV countertop. I‚Äôve personally tucked it into a corner next to my microwave, and you‚Äôd hardly notice it‚Äôs there‚Äîexcept for its vibrant poppy red color, which feels like it was designed to grab attention in the best way. The matte finish adds a touch of sophistication, and the cord storage keeps my counter looking tidy and free of clutter. 

[Grab Keurig 062151516236 at the best price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b096yr1w7r/)

**Simplicity at Its Core**

This coffee maker is all about ease of use, which I highly recommend for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to deal with overcomplicated gadgets first thing in the morning. With a single-cup reservoir, you add fresh water for each brew‚Äîno complicated water tanks to clean or worry about forgetting to refill. Just place your favorite K-Cup pod, press the brew button, and voil√†! You‚Äôll have a fresh cup of coffee in minutes. I even tried the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter to brew ground coffee, and it worked surprisingly well‚Äîthough you‚Äôll want to make sure the grind is fine enough. 

**Works for Almost Any Lifestyle**

Whether you want just a quick 6-ounce cup to wake up or a full 12-ounce brew to last through a meeting, this coffee maker handles both perfectly. The removable drip tray accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall (I tested it with mine, and spill-free success!), making it ideal for days when you‚Äôre on the go. Its manual operation, combined with an energy-efficient auto-off feature, makes it a dependable and environmentally friendly option. Forget to turn it off? Don‚Äôt worry; it powers down 90 seconds after your last brew.

**Perks**

- Impressively compact design easily fits into limited spaces.  
- Brew a variety of sizes between 6 to 12 ounces with recyclable K-Cup pods.  
- Energy-saving auto shut-off after 90 seconds conserves electricity.  
- Suitable for travel mugs thanks to the adjustable drip tray.  

**Shortcomings**

- Single-cup reservoir requires refilling for each brew.  
- Lack of a water level indicator makes precise filling tricky at times.  
- It‚Äôs on the louder side during operation, which may disrupt quiet mornings.  

**Product Comparisons**

I‚Äôve had previous experience with other single-serve brewers, such as the Nespresso Pixie and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. While the Pixie offers a more premium feel and the smoothness of espresso, it doesn‚Äôt provide the same flexibility when it comes to cup sizes or the affordability of using K-Cup pods. The Hamilton Beach model offers a dual-purpose benefit‚Äîground coffee and K-Cup pods‚Äîwhich is convenient, but its design felt bulky on the counter, unlike this sleek gem. For anyone valuing portability and simplicity without compromise, the Keurig coffee maker finds that sweet balance.

**Value for Money**

For a coffee maker that fits well in literally any tight space, brews fresh coffee efficiently, and maintains user-friendly functionality, this compact device delivers great value. I especially appreciate that I can use my own ground coffee or any K-Cup pod of my choosing. The durability coupled with its minimalist design and energy-saving features makes it worth the investment for casual and frequent coffee drinkers alike. While the single-cup reservoir might be a slight inconvenience for some, I actually enjoy the habit of filling it with fresh water each time‚Äîit ensures better-tasting coffee.

1n5o3vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1n5o3vg/melitta_brand_coffee_filters/,Melitta brand coffee filters,"Around 216 days ago I made what is probably considered a controversial Haul Post from a GE grocery store.  One of the controversial purchases was coffee filters.  I paid $3.49 for 200 filters.  It was pointed out several times that I could have bought coffee filters from Aldis or Walmart $1.99 for 200 filters.  The Aldis today says $2.05 for Beaumont brand filters.  Let‚Äôs assume the $1.99 price and say that I could have saved $1.50.  It took my 215 days to consume all 200 filters (I drink way too much coffee).  Spreading my cost savings out over the course of 215 days until I needed to replace my filters - the daily cost is $0.007 per day.  Over 30 days my savings are $0.21.  

My purpose for this exercise is to throw this out for discussion - specifically where should you draw the line when it comes to budgeting for food purchases?  You have cost vs quality considerations and substitutes to evaluate.  IMHO, grabbing fast food several days a week is a significant expense that can be addressed by cooking at home.  That‚Äôs huge.  My coffee filter example OTOH is not.  

The inspiration for this post was the flashback I had to 215 days ago with my post when I reached for my last filter yesterday from that shopping day from months ago.  I know I can look into reusable filters.  Tried them a few times and the results are inconsistent at best.

1n5o3uh,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2102851/police-must-act-end-2-2bn,Police must act to end ¬£2.2bn shoplifting epidemic now,"*Britain‚Äôs shoplifting epidemic is being driven by a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù of factors driving thieves from all walks of life to plunder hundreds of millions of pounds worth of goods from shop shelves every month. Serious organised crime gangs ‚Äì from both home and abroad ‚Äì are carrying out military-style missions, whilst there has been a sharp rise of ‚Äúopportunistic stealing‚Äù with even middle-class professionals and once trusty-worthy pensioners stealing as they struggle to combat a¬†cost of living¬†crisis.*

*Meanwhile vulnerable children are being exploited in ruthless fashion by hardened criminals whilst there is also an explosion of people stealing and abusing shop staff for videos to be posted on social media site‚Äôs such as Snapchat and¬†TikTok. In response the Daily Express today demands action to halt the¬†shoplifting crisis¬†that is costing stores more than ¬£2.2billion a year. The target of our new campaign - that police must attend every reported theft - is the one move that store bosses say would stop the epidemic, catch more crooks and provide reassurance to owners and staff.*

*The Express crusade insists that police and politicians alike ""Stop The Shoplifters"".*

*With shop prices pushed higher by the cost of extra security, Lucy Whing - anticrime policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium trade group - warned last night: ""Something has got to change. Retailers have spent ¬£1.8billion on security measures last year and the Government has promised more resources to tackle the issue. The missing piece of the puzzle is a commitment from police forces to attend all incidents reported, particularly when violence is involved.""*

*Retailers think the Government's ¬£200million¬†neighbourhood policing plan¬†and moves to make assaulting a shopworker a stand-alone offence will help - but admit their trust in many forces is broken.*

*Shoplifting offences recorded in England and Wales last year topped 500,000 for the first time, with 530,643 offences logged - a 20% rise on the previous 12 months and the most since current recording practices began in 2002-2003.*

*Meanwhile more than¬†one in 10 retail staff¬†have been threatened with weapons in the past year as shoplifting turns increasingly violent.*

*Kevin Burton of Kingdom Security which works with hundreds of stores, including Morrisons and Marks & Spencer, claims that ruthless Eastern European crooks target the UK.*

*Mr Burton said: ""We really do find ourselves in a perfect storm situation where we have serious organised crime gangs operating on a huge scale - both home-grown and from overseas - along with people from all kinds of backgrounds stealing for a variety of reasons.""*

*Some gangs are known to raid dozens of stores in one day.*

*Mr Burton said: ""Let's say they leave from somewhere in Kent, jump in a van and drive up the East Coast of the country, hitting multiple stores in a single day. Their route then goes across to the Midlands and then back down south on the M6 to the M25 and they basically do a big loop, getting home with sometimes ¬£15,000 worth of stolen stock.""*

*Champagne is a favourite hit for Eastern European gangs but British mobs also steal vodka, whisky, rum, tea and coffee that they sell for cash at around 50% of the shop prices on housing estates, in pubs - and online. Mr Burton added: ""They generally operate in groups of two and three. There are storm-in gangs who operate predominantly in London, where they just race into a store and fill bags galore and go.*

*""But we've also got others, like one currently operating in the North East who work in a group of two or three. One goes in first with a basket...he's kind of a spotter to see where staff and security guards are.*

*""Then the others walk in with two bags in a trolley, as if they're going to do a full shop. But they will instead go straight down to the alcohol aisles and fill the trolley with 50 or 60 bottles.*

*""The bags are on top and they will then wait for somebody else to walk out beside them - usually a little old lady or someone honest - who instantly thinks it's them that's sparked the alarm and so they stop and wait for the guard whilst the gang keep walking at pace. They load straight into a car and are away.""*

*But it is not just organised gangs who are driving the dramatic rise in thefts - socio-economic reasons are also fuelling the crisis.*

*Mr Burton explained: ""We have found a new trend of more and more opportunistic theft from people who are working full-time but who are perhaps struggling with the cost-of living crisis.*

*""They just can't afford to get the main kind of groceries they used to as prices increase. Household budgets are having to tighten...we're finding a lot more first-time offenders.*

*""People who we would never, ever have looked at previously in the past and thought, 'You know what, we need to keep an eye on that kind of range of shopper'. The security expert says pensioners are also increasingly light fingered. Mr Burton said: ""We've quite a lot of older people as well, older generation 'skip scanning'...where they'll be buying a number of items but just miss a few from the scanner.""*

*He said self-service tills are monitored by CCTV while weight scales help combat some aspects of the scourge - but shoppers find ways to beat the system.*

*Mr Burton added: ""There is definitely increased opportunity through self-scan checkouts. Stores try to have staff around and guards placed nearby, and we have found personal engagement reduces this type of offending by 30%.*

*""But it is hard because thieves will claim human error, and because they have not been caught before they come up as first-time try to have staff around and guards placed nearby, and we have found personal engagement reduces this type of offending by 30%.*

*""But it is hard because thieves will claim human error, and because they have not been caught before they come up as first-time offenders which means police are not going to prosecute.*

*""If \[officers\] do attend then it is generally just a flea in the ear and off you go with a 'Don't do it again' warning.*

*""However, police attendance at all incidents would definitely be a big deterrent."" This year it was announced forces would be recruiting 3,000 extra neighbourhood police and community support officers over the next 12 months.*

*Previous legislation that made stealing goods worth less than ¬£200 a summary offence has also been axed, meaning tougher sentences could soon be passed. But workers on the retail frontline say that unless police vow to respond to every single incident the problem will continue to worsen.*

*Policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said the neighbourhood policing plan would ""reverse the¬†Tories' decade of decline"".*

*But Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said law and order was ""taking a back seat under Labour.*

*""They must urgently get a grip to ensure our police have the resources they need to cut crime and keep the British people safe.*",3,1756731765.0,ukpolice,3,1.0,False

Love does not enjoy causing pain. I sit here, with my coffee in a sun drenched room. A sweet dog is asleep at my feet. I pull my blanket tighter as if I can protect myself from your words. As if it‚Äôs a shield that can absorb comments that say I am unfit to be a wife, a mother, and that no man would want me. Comments that mock my desirability and remind me I have three years left of being attractive. Comments that talk about how easily replaced I am. You tell me I am stuck, ruined, unclean, unwanted, retarded, and that I have a weird, monkey face. There are then the usual comments that I am a whore and a skank. You threaten me if I write about you on Reddit. I may be all of those things, but I am also hurting and I need to write. So I do and I slide onto the floor and my sweet girl curls up on my lap. I idly stroke the top of her head. Such ugly words have no place here.

But still. They linger. They chip away at my shield. They will get through again. I want to say that they don‚Äôt bother me. That it doesn‚Äôt hurt. But you know what to say and how to say it in a way that devastates me. I hold back tears, I hear an imaginary clock ticking away my attractive years. I reach up and touch my face. Is it weird? Ugly? The face of a monkey? I feel the high forehead, the big eyes, the big nose, and the full lips. **Perhaps**. I can‚Äôt hold the ruins of my self esteem anymore and I let the pieces go, and then down goes the shield. I cry.

You tell me you want a hot, big tittied blonde. You crow about watching porn again, about downloading tinder so you can get laid. The implication being that I am plain, brunette, and small in a way that‚Äôs unappealing. Easily replaceable with a younger, hot, blonde. If that is what you want, I hope you find it. I hope you enjoy yourself. I have my dog with me and two new companions have joined us: self hatred and shame. Self hatred is triumphant, *I always told you that you were ugly and undesirable* it jeers, and shame says nothing but I stir the ends of my brown hair with my fingers and then wrap my arms around myself. I want to hide. 

So to me, and to anyone else reading this, please don‚Äôt forget a few things. You are beautiful. Whatever you hate about yourself, are things that someone else will love. And they will remind you of this. You are worthy of love, respect, gentleness, and your dreams. You deserve someone that will gently help you lay your shield down. You deserve someone that will step in front of you, a protector, and hold you close, a lover. Their presence is a shield, a balm, like sun on your face. May they bring you peace and warmth, like a dozing dog on a carpeted patch of sun. It can be easy to forget. 

But please don‚Äôt.

I was 8 years old (I'm 49 now). I've reflected on it a lot and consider it the most supernatural experience I've ever had in my life.  
My maternal grandfather died, and my brothers, mother, and father returned to our hometown in the countryside of my state for the wake and burial. Back then, wakes were held in people's homes. So, okay, I remember joking with another cousin my age, since my brothers were a little older, and the whole family was together‚Äîthat normal funeral thing. Anyway, the wake was at night and the burial in the morning. I didn't even know what was happening, I didn't understand death, so I took it all as a joke.

After all that, it got dark and we were going to go back to the city the next day and we all slept together in the house (the same as the wake, it was my grandmother's house, my grandfather's wife, she was widowed), I remember we were all talking, the adults, and the children and so on, and then as there were a lot of people, some mattresses were put up and my sister slept with my other older brother and some cousins, my younger brother who was a baby slept with my parents, and some others piled up with uncle, I was supposed to sleep at my older sister's feet, but I remember not wanting to sleep there because I was scared, it was much closer to the door and the kitchen room, that whole child thing, I asked to sleep with my mother and she said there was no room, so she told me to sleep with my grandmother, who was already sleeping with another cousin, so I went there and stayed quietly.

That was around midnight, everyone talking and blah blah blah, until some people fell asleep, my grandmother was still talking to my mother, my father went to sleep, then my mother went to sleep and I tried to fall asleep but couldn't, my grandmother shook her foot to show that she was awake, when she stopped I shook her to wake her up and kept shaking her to show that she wasn't going to sleep, until at a certain point she fell asleep and everything was silent, it must have been around 2 or 3 am at that point.

I clearly heard the gate creak as if someone had arrived, the dogs started barking (in the same way as when my grandfather normally came home, they were his dogs) and I heard footsteps in the courtyard.

The house was one of those simple ones, with a front and back entrance, a hallway that led to the back, so I had to go through this space to get to the back door.

I started to hear footsteps going through this hallway/garage to the back door, which means he knew that the back door gave access to the house, but the back door was obviously locked. That's when I started waking my grandmother up and saying ‚Äúsomeone's in the yard, there's people there‚Äù and she said ‚Äúgo to sleep girl, there's no one there‚Äù, and then I heard the back door opening, literally someone entering the house, all very slowly.

I kind of pushed my grandmother again and said, ‚ÄúGrandma, someone has entered the house, there's someone inside,‚Äù and she replied, a little sleepily, but also hearing, ‚ÄúIt's your uncle Lico, go to sleep.‚Äù My uncle Lico had already traveled to another city, he didn't stay after the funeral, he traveled right after. At this point I was totally freaked out, my heart was racing and I almost had a heart attack. Footsteps began to approach the kitchen (we were sleeping in the room where the wake had been) and I felt someone's presence, but obviously I just closed my eyes tightly, I didn't open them for anything, even though I felt that presence coming and stood there, just looking and analyzing, I didn't hear a voice or an image clearly because I didn't have the courage to open my eyes, I was paralyzed, after a while like that, there was a shuttered window, so when it started to get light around 5am I opened my eyes and saw the light, that's when I got up the courage, finally all that was over, everyone got up and went to have coffee etc

Dream it wasn't, I clearly heard my grandmother and my mother talking at the coffee table that my grandfather had come to say goodbye to us that night and that I heard everything, my sister today confirms this story to me and that she felt embraced by ''something'' that night, I wonder if I had slept at her feet. ..

And well, perhaps the scariest thing for me today that I understand better is that, my grandmother heard it too, she didn't want to get up or tell me that everything was fine, she literally told me to go to sleep and said that it was my uncle, that is, she also heard everything, but ignored it, clearly afraid too but didn't want to show it, not being something individual, and how scary was that for an ADULT AND OLD woman not wanting to check, something was there that night.

I don't think anyone broke into the house, the dogs barked EXACTLY as they barked at my grandfather, the footsteps were specific, the walk, the door that was locked opening, passing through the kitchen, everything exactly as he did.",6,1756731599.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

I left a very coercively controlling relationship about 2.5 years ago.  I've been living in shared accommodation ever since.  My landlord is an absolute creep and I cannot stand him, I try to avoid him and spend most of my time in my bedroom.  I'm staying here because I've been waiting for the house I owned wih my ex to sell, which finally happened last month so I finally have the money to get a place of my own, but I need to first wait until I pass probation at my current job next month.  I am so ready to leave this place! I could rent, but wasting money on rent is not sensible.  

I lost my other job at the start of this year, they told me to jump or be pushed.  I chose to jump and got a good settlement which is positive, not complaining.  I've seen got a much better job so that is positive! Yay.  But it was 8 weeks of waiting for a job and I felt completely unmoored and alone at that time.  

Just prior to that I'd been dumped for having an abortion earlier this year, the guy was NOT an honest person.  I would have loved to have been a mum but I couldn't have afforded it alone, he wouldn't have supported me, and it would have meant kissing goodbye to buying a house, so I chose not to go ahead.  It was the most awful situation ever, it was a pure accident.  It feels like a sick joke that it happened.   The actual experience was the most painful and horrible thing ever, and I went through it alone.  

My mum lost her twin sister earlier this year just after that, she refuses to get grief counselling, my dad is emotionally unavailable and was physically abusive to all of us growing up, and that has had long term impacts.  I feel the weight of looking after her on me and if I can't make it over to drive her around and go for coffee at the weekend I feel enormously guilty.  

Then there's my sister... who I always thought I was very close to but who i've realised is just very transactional.  She is regularly rude about people who work from home (i'm one of those people) because she is a nurse and ""saves lives"".  She bitches about me ever wanting to spend time with her because she is ""too busy"".  She throws it back in my face that she was there for me when I needed to escape my 5 year abusive relationship.  When I was pregnant and trying to decide what to do she told me that if I couldn't feed my cats then I couldn't be a mother (just becuase she was up earlier than me for her shift and fed them at 6am when I was up at 7.30am).  I have cut her off because she has prioritised her fiance above literally all else, I never see her, she expects me to be available when i'm working because i'm at home on her timetable.   When I stopped being available she unfriended me on Facebook and told our mother that it was my fault.   She gets hugely abusive when she's drunk and was hitting me last time I went out with her, and causing a scene (we nearly got thrown out).  

Then I have a guy who i've known for 7 years, who was a friend to me throughout my abusive relationship, and he increased communication around the time I lost my job, only for me to find out that he's witheld having a partner for 18 years for this entire time, basically because it allows him to speak to me as though he's a batchelor and make out he's on his own.  I'm basically ego food to him.  He's never sexual with me, but it's the undercurrent of the conversations being ""more than just friends"" especially given that he messages me constantly with updates from his travels and sometimes talks to me for hours.   Another user.  

  
On top of that, a married ex colleague.... telling me all his marital woes and joking about me ""fancying him"" (I don't) and sending me disgusting instagram reels.  He complains about getting no sex in his marriage and sends me pictures of women saying ""i'd love to bend her over"".  Absolutely gross.  

Then there's my ex boss who i cut off earlier this year for propositioning me with a FWB situation then he turned on me when i told him it was completely inappropriate to ask that after he had been a good friend for years.  

I also have a friend who had a strop at me for considering buying a house in a local vollage because it was ""out of town"" and ""well how are you going to get into town for drinks"" - despite owning a 3 bedroom house and talking about her friend basically staying over all the time, there is this thing of ""well you'll have to pay for a taxi fare home that will be expensive"".  

Why is EVERYONE in my life taking from me or just not showing up when I do exactly that for them.  If it was me i'd offer a room, I'd offer support, I'd sub them, I'd pay for things, I'd be honest..... I have been all these things.  I'm not the angel Gabriel but ffs seriously.  Why am I surrounded by people who all have ulterior motives???

I have never felt more alone in my whole life!  ",12,1756731508.0,AskWomenOver40,17,0.83,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Taylor Fritz vs. Novak Djokovic: A Clash of Titans (and a Rabbit in the Headlights)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a tennis showdown that‚Äôs like a Shakespearean drama‚Ä¶ if Shakespeare wrote fanfiction about a rabbit staring down a serpent. On one side: **Taylor Fritz**, the American upstart with the power game of a caffeinated bull and the Grand Slam resume of a man who‚Äôs seen more quarterfinals than a Netflix documentary. On the other: **Novak Djokovic**, the Serbian sorcerer who‚Äôs turned hardcourts into his personal magic show, complete with levitation, mind games, and a 2023 US Open title still glowing in his trophy cabinet like a cursed heirloom.

### Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Bookies‚Äô Favorite?

The numbers don‚Äôt lie (well, they might fib a little to pad the vig, but let‚Äôs not get technical). Djokovic is the overwhelming favorite at **-150 to -160**, translating to an implied win probability of **61-62%**. Fritz, meanwhile, is priced at **+245 to +260**, implying a **28-30%** chance. To put that in perspective, Fritz‚Äôs odds are about the same as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich on the first try. Not great.

The spread is set at **-3.0 to -3.5 games** for Djokovic, meaning even if you bet on the Serb, he‚Äôd better not give Fritz a nap. The total games line sits at **40.5**, so expect a grueling three-setter where neither player will blink‚Ä¶ unless Fritz‚Äôs serve decides to take a coffee break.

### News Digest: Injuries, Form, and Why Fritz Should Pack a Snack

Let‚Äôs start with the good news: **No major injuries**! Djokovic just dispatched Jan-Lennard Struff in straight sets, ending the German‚Äôs magical run that included upsets over Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe. The Serb looked like a man possessed by the spirit of Pete Sampras, serving aces so fast they probably broke the sound barrier.

Fritz? He‚Äôs coming off a three-set takedown of Tomas Machac, a match that proved he can handle pressure‚Ä¶ as long as the pressure isn‚Äôt a 23-time Grand Slam champion with a Ph.D. in mental toughness. The American‚Äôs resume? Impres

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Well, They Do, But Not Here)**  
Carlos Alcaraz is the statistical equivalent of a Tesla on a 100% charge: unstoppable, inevitable, and slightly terrifying to onlookers. The bookmakers agree, pricing him as a near-lock at decimal odds of **1.05‚Äì1.06** (implied probability: **94‚Äì96%**). Jiri Lehecka, meanwhile, is a charming underdog at **8.5‚Äì11.0** (7‚Äì11%), which is about the same chance as winning the lottery while juggling live chickens. The spread (-7.5 games for Alcaraz) and the even-money total (32.5 games) suggest Alcaraz will dominate, but not so thoroughly that the match becomes a nap-inducing tutorial on proper backhand technique.

**Digest the News: Injuries, History, and Why Lehecka Isn‚Äôt a Pushover**  
Alcaraz enters this clash on a **7-match winning streak** at the US Open, having not lost a set‚Äîhis latest victory over Arthur Rinderknech was a masterclass in composure, including a tiebreak that made Rinderknech question his life choices. Lehecka, the 2022 French Open and US Open champion (wait, *what*?‚Äîoh, right, this is 2025, and time travel is still broken), is no slouch. Ranked **ATP No. 21**, he‚Äôs a gritty defender with a game that Alcaraz himself admits is ‚Äúvery tough‚Äù to handle. Their head-to-head is a spicy 3-2 in Lehecka‚Äôs favor, including a Doha Open win where Alcaraz muttered, ‚Äú*Lo paso mal*‚Äù (translating roughly to ‚ÄúI suffer like a man who accidentally bought a lifetime supply of cilantro‚Äù).

But context matters: Alcaraz has beaten Lehecka **twice on grass** (Queen‚Äôs 2023 and the 2025 final), while their Doha clash was on a surface where Lehecka‚Äôs consistency‚Äîthink of it as a coffee machine that *never* burns you‚Äîproved enough

1n5nxaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/activedirectory/comments/1n5nxaf/lets_have_a_refresher_on_group_policy_old_is_gold/,Let's Have a Re-Fresher on Group Policy: Old is Gold!,"# In the ever-evolving landscape of IT, where DevOps, cloud, and automation dominate the conversation, it's easy to overlook the foundational technologies that keep our core infrastructure running. One such veteran, Group Policy (GP), remains an indispensable workhorse in the Active Directory (AD) environment. Much like a classic piece of engineering, its principles are timeless. So, let's pour a fresh cup of coffee and take a moment for a valuable re-fresher on the old-is-gold technology that is Group Policy.

# What is Group Policy, Really?

At its heart, **Group Policy is an infrastructure** designed to deliver and apply configurations or policy settings to targeted users and computers within an Active Directory domain. Think of it as a centralized system for enforcing your organization's desired state‚Äîbe it security settings, mapped drives, registry tweaks, or software installations.

This infrastructure is powered by two key components:



1. **The Group Policy Engine:** The core logic on the client machine that orchestrates the entire processing cycle.
2. **Client-Side Extensions (CSEs):** Specialized plug-in modules responsible for interpreting and applying specific types of policy settings (e.g., Security Settings, Drive Maps, Registry Policies).



# Core GPO Concepts: The Building Blocks

Before we dive into the architecture, let's clarify some essential terminology that often comes up in troubleshooting:



* **GPT vs. GPC:** A Group Policy Object (GPO) is split into two parts.
* **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Processing:**
* **Group Policy Caching:** A feature introduced in newer OS versions (like Windows 10/11) that stores a copy of the GPT locally. This allows a computer to process policies using the cached copy at startup, even if a domain controller is not immediately available, significantly improving logon performance.
* **GPO vs. GPP:** This is a crucial distinction.
* **CSE (Client-Side Extension):** As mentioned, these are the components that handle the heavy lifting for specific policy areas. Knowing which CSE is responsible for a failing policy is the first step in effective troubleshooting.



# The Pillars of Group Policy: Critical Dependencies

Group Policy doesn't operate in a vacuum. Its health is intrinsically tied to the health of your core AD infrastructure. When a GP issue arises, these are the usual suspects:



1. **Network Connectivity:** The client must be able to communicate with a Domain Controller. Without this, nothing else works.
2. **SysVol Replication & Availability:** The GPT is stored in the SysVol share. If this share is unavailable due to a replication issue (using either the older FRS or modern DFSR), clients will not be able to retrieve the policy files.
3. **LDAP & AD Replication:** The GPC is stored in Active Directory. If AD replication is broken, a client might contact a DC that doesn't have the latest version of the GPC, leading to unexpected results.
4. **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation):** Used extensively for **WMI Filtering** (to target GPOs based on dynamic queries) and for **Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP)** calculations. A broken WMI repository on a client will break filtering and troubleshooting.



# Group Policy Architecture: A Visual Journey

The true ""gold"" of this re-fresher is understanding the process. The following high-level architecture diagram, inspired by internal Microsoft concepts, illustrates the components involved in GPO processing during logon. This mental model is your most powerful tool for troubleshooting.

**The Group Policy Processing Cycle:**



* **1. Initiation:** The process begins at computer startup or user logon. The Group Policy engine (userinit.exe for users, the OS itself for machines) takes charge.
* **2. Network & DC Discovery:** The client establishes secure connectivity to a Domain Controller using the secure channel.
* **3. GPO Discovery (LDAP):** The engine queries Active Directory via LDAP to locate applicable GPOs based on the computer's and user's LDAP membership. This involves reading the GPC information.
* **4. GPT Retrieval:** The engine accesses the SysVol share on the DC to download the policy files from the GPT for all applicable GPOs.
* **5. WMI Filtering:** If a GPO has a WMI filter, the filter is evaluated on the *local client* to determine if the GPO should be applied.
* **6. CSE Processing:** The engine hands off specific sections of the downloaded policy to the respective Client-Side Extensions (e.g., the Security CSE processes security settings, the Drive Maps CSE processes GPP drive maps).
* **7. Application & Reporting:** Each CSE applies its settings and reports success or failure back to the core engine, which is logged in the Event Log. The final result is a configured system.



By understanding this flow, you can pinpoint failure points. Is the issue discovering the GPO? Check LDAP/AD replication. Is it applying a security setting? Focus on the Security CSE and its logs. Are drive maps failing? Investigate the Group Policy Preferences CSE and network connectivity to the target file server.

# Conclusion: Timeless Value

While new technologies emerge, the fundamental principles of centralized management and desired state configuration that Group Policy embodies are more relevant than ever. By taking this moment to re-fresh our understanding of its core concepts, dependencies, and architecture, we equip ourselves to not only troubleshoot more effectively but also to design more robust and reliable AD environments. Some things, like a well-crafted Group Policy, truly are old is gold.

1n5nx2n,https://youtu.be/e65Qyjq41aE,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Lake Island Horror Stories,"# ""The Tin Crown"":

I arrived on Beaver Island back in the summer of 1849, a young man full of hope and faith, fleeing the troubles on the mainland. My family had heard tales of a new leader, James Strang, who promised a safe haven for believers like us. He claimed to be the true successor to Joseph Smith, with a letter straight from the prophet himself. At first, it all seemed like a blessing. The island sat quiet in the middle of Lake Michigan, far from prying eyes, with thick woods and rocky shores that kept the world at bay. We built homes from logs, planted gardens, and gathered for meetings where Strang spoke with a voice that pulled you in, like he held secrets only the chosen could hear.

But soon, small things started to unsettle me. Strang ruled with a firm hand. He introduced rules that bound us closer together, but they also sowed doubt. One evening, as we sat around a fire after a long day of work, my neighbor Elias whispered to me, ""Have you noticed how he watches everyone? Like he's waiting for someone to slip."" I nodded, but said nothing. Elias had a wife and two small children, and he feared speaking out. We all did.

Then came the coronation in 1850. Strang declared himself king‚Äînot just of the church, but in a way that felt absolute. We assembled in a clearing near the harbor, hundreds of us standing in silence as he appeared in a red robe, a shiny tin crown on his head, holding a wooden staff. His eyes gleamed as he raised his arms and said, ""This island is our kingdom, given by God. I am your protector, your guide."" The crowd cheered, but I felt a knot in my gut. It was as if we'd stepped into something irreversible, cut off from the rest of the world by miles of cold water.

Conflicts brewed with the fishermen from nearby towns. They called us thieves, accused us of taking their nets and boats under cover of night. Strang denied it, but rumors spread like wildfire. One night, a group of them rowed over, drunk and angry, shouting threats from the shore. ""We'll burn you out!"" one bellowed. Strang had us arm ourselves with whatever we could find‚Äîaxes, rifles from the mainland. He fired a cannon we'd hidden in the trees, the boom echoing across the lake, scattering them like rats. After that, we posted guards every night, peering into the darkness, wondering if they'd come back with more men.

Inside our group, things turned darker. Strang took up polygamy, saying it was divine will. He married several women, including a young girl named Elvira, barely nineteen, who he dressed as a boy and called his nephew for months to hide it. Whispers grew about favoritism and jealousy. My sister, Rebecca, confided in me one afternoon while we mended fences. ""He's changed,"" she said softly, glancing over her shoulder. ""Last week, he scolded Mary for questioning him, and now she won't leave her cabin. What if he turns on us next?"" I tried to reassure her, but her words lingered, making every shadow seem alive with secrets.

Punishments became harsher. Thomas Bedford, a hot-tempered man who'd joined us from Wisconsin, got into trouble when his wife refused Strang's orders. Strang had him whipped in front of everyone‚Äîlashes that left bloody stripes on his back. Bedford stood there afterward, eyes burning with hate, muttering to Alexander Wentworth, another punished follower, ""This king will pay for his cruelty."" I overheard them by the docks one evening, their voices low and urgent. ""We can't let him control us like this,"" Bedford said. Wentworth nodded, his face pale. ""Soon. When the moment comes.""

The island felt smaller with each passing day, the woods closing in, the lake a barrier that trapped us. Strange noises at night‚Äîbranches snapping, distant calls‚Äîmade me wonder if outsiders lurked or if it was our own people plotting. Paranoia spread. People stopped talking openly, fearing spies among us. Strang grew more isolated, surrounding himself with loyal guards, but even they looked uneasy.

It all came to a head in June 1856. A U.S. Navy steamer, the USS Michigan, anchored off the island. Strang went aboard to meet the captain, confident as always. But as he stepped back onto the pier, Bedford and Wentworth waited in the crowd. I was nearby, unloading supplies, when it happened. Bedford called out, ""Strang!"" The king turned, and in that instant, Bedford pulled a pistol and fired point-blank into his spine. Strang staggered, blood blooming on his robe. Wentworth followed with another shot, hitting him in the head. Strang crumpled, gasping, as chaos erupted‚Äîscreams, people running. The assassins fled to the ship, where the crew protected them, claiming it was justice.

Strang didn't die right away. We carried him to his home, where he lay for weeks, refusing doctors, insisting God would heal him. His wives tended him, their faces drawn with fear. I visited once, and he grabbed my hand, his grip weak but fierce. ""Betrayers everywhere,"" he rasped, eyes wild. ""Watch the shores. They'll come for all of you."" His words chilled me, as if he saw ghosts in the room.

When he finally passed on July 9, the island descended into terror. A mob from the mainland arrived days later‚Äîfishermen and settlers, armed and vengeful. They stormed our homes, smashing windows, dragging people out. ""Get off our lake!"" they shouted. My family and I hid in the woods for hours, hearing cries and gunshots. Rebecca clutched my arm, whispering, ""What if they find us?"" We watched flames rise from cabins, the smoke thick and acrid.

In the end, they forced us all onto boats, stripping us of everything‚Äîclothes, tools, even food. We scattered to the winds, broken and haunted. I ended up in Chicago, but the memories cling like fog. The isolation of that island, the way trust eroded into fear, the shots that echoed in my mind‚Äîit's a nightmare that never fades. Beaver Island was supposed to be paradise, but it became a prison of suspicion and blood, where one man's ambition turned neighbors into enemies and faith into dread. Even now, I wake at night, listening for footsteps on the water, wondering if the past will catch up.





# ""Murder on Mackinac"":

I had been planning this family getaway for what felt like ages. My mother-in-law, Frances, insisted on joining us at Mackinac Island that summer of 1960. She was a strong woman in her mid-fifties, widowed for a few years, and she loved the idea of a quiet escape on that little island in Lake Huron. No cars allowed, just horses clipping along the paths and bikes whizzing by. We checked into the Murray Hotel, a cozy place with wooden floors that creaked underfoot and rooms overlooking the water. Frances shared a suite with my husband, Robert, and me, while his sister, Clara, and her husband stayed next door.

From the start, Frances seemed eager to explore. ""I need some time alone to clear my head,"" she said that first afternoon, adjusting her scarf around her neck. She had on her favorite light dress, the one with small flowers, and carried a little purse. Robert nodded. ""Just stick to the main paths, Mother. Don't wander too far into the woods."" She smiled at him. ""I'm not a child, dear. I'll be back before dinner."" We watched her head out the hotel door, her steps firm on the gravel path leading toward the ring road that circles the island.

Dinner came and went, but Frances didn't show up. Clara fidgeted with her napkin. ""Maybe she met someone and lost track of time."" Robert paced the dining room. ""This isn't like her. She's always punctual."" I suggested we check the nearby shops, but the hotel clerk shook his head when we asked. ""Haven't seen her since she left. Lots of folks out today with the yacht race finishing up. Boats from Chicago bringing all sorts of people."" That race meant the island was busier than usual, ferries unloading crowds of sailors and spectators. Strangers everywhere, laughing and chatting, but it made the place feel less safe somehow.

By evening, worry set in. Robert and I walked the paths near the Grand Hotel, calling her name softly at first, then louder. The woods edged close to the road, thick with trees and underbrush that swallowed sounds. ""Frances! Where are you?"" No answer. A man on a bicycle passed us, his face hidden under a hat. He slowed for a moment, staring, then pedaled away. ""Did you see that?"" I whispered to Robert. ""He looked right at us."" Robert frowned. ""Probably just a tourist. Let's keep looking.""

The next morning, we reported her missing to the local constable. He was a stout fellow named Harold, with a mustache that twitched when he spoke. ""We'll organize a search party. Island's not that big‚Äîabout eight miles around. She couldn't have gone far."" By noon, volunteers gathered: hotel staff, some year-round residents, even a few sailors from the race. Clara joined us, her eyes red. ""What if she fell and hurt herself?"" she said, gripping my arm. I tried to reassure her. ""She's tough. We'll find her.""

We split into groups. Robert and I took the trail between the Grand Hotel and British Landing, the same area Frances mentioned walking. The path was narrow, flanked by dense foliage. Twigs snapped under our feet, and every rustle made me glance over my shoulder. ""Robert, do you think someone might have... hurt her?"" I asked quietly. He stopped, his face pale. ""Don't say that. It's probably nothing."" But his voice lacked conviction.

As we searched, we talked to people along the way. A young hotel worker, a boy named Tom who helped with luggage, approached us. ""I saw your mother-in-law yesterday,"" he said, shifting his weight. ""She was talking to a man near the woods. Tall guy, wearing a dark jacket. Didn't recognize him‚Äîmust be from the boats."" Robert leaned in. ""What did he look like? Did they go together?"" Tom shrugged. ""Couldn't see his face well. They walked off toward the trees. That's all I know."" Clara overheard and gasped. ""Why didn't you say something earlier?"" Tom backed away. ""Didn't think it mattered until now.""

That detail gnawed at us. Who was this man? The island felt smaller, more confining, with the lake lapping at its edges like a barrier. No quick way off without a ferry, and those ran on schedule. The killer‚Äîif there was one‚Äîmight still be here, blending in with the crowds. That night, back at the hotel, sleep evaded me. Robert sat up in bed. ""I keep thinking about that stranger. What if he followed her?"" I pulled the blanket closer. ""We have to trust the police. They're checking everyone.""

The second day dragged on. More volunteers combed the woods, poking sticks into bushes. Harold updated us at the hotel. ""We've questioned dozens. A few suspicious types‚Äîmen with no clear reason for being here. One sailor admitted to a fight last night, but he has witnesses."" Clara pressed him. ""What about the man Tom saw?"" Harold nodded. ""We're looking into it. Stay close; don't go out alone."" His words hung in the air, a warning that danger lurked.

In the afternoon, I ventured out with Clara to retrace Frances' steps again. The path wound through taller trees, branches forming a canopy overhead. A faint smell of earth and decay filled the air. ""Listen,"" Clara whispered suddenly. ""Footsteps."" We stopped. Behind us, a crunch of leaves. We turned, but saw no one. ""Hello?"" I called. Silence. Then, another snap, closer. We hurried back to the road, breaths quick. ""Someone was there,"" Clara said, voice trembling. ""Watching us.""

By the third day, exhaustion weighed on everyone. The search party grew, now including state police from the mainland. They arrived by boat, serious men in uniforms carrying notebooks. Lead detective, a sharp-eyed guy named Ellis, gathered us in the hotel lobby. ""We've covered most of the island. No sign yet, but we're not giving up."" Robert asked, ""Any leads on that tall man?"" Ellis hesitated. ""A couple of matches, but alibis check out. Could be unrelated.""

Late that afternoon, a shout echoed from the woods. Volunteers had found something. We rushed over, pushing through the crowd. There, in a shallow dip off the path, lay Frances. Her body, twisted and still, half-covered by leaves. Bruises marked her neck, her dress torn. I turned away, horror rising. Clara collapsed sobbing. ""Who did this?"" Robert demanded of Ellis. The detective knelt, examining. ""Struck from behind first, then strangled. We'll find out.""

The investigation intensified. Police interviewed everyone again. Tom the hotel worker seemed nervous. ""I didn't do anything,"" he insisted when questioned. ""Just saw them talking."" Suspects emerged: a transient sailor with a history of violence, ruled out by timing; a local handyman who avoided eye contact. Even family members were briefly considered, but cleared. Ellis confided later, ""Evidence is thin. No fingerprints, just some hairs that don't match anyone yet.""

Weeks turned to months. We left the island, but the fear followed. Back home, I locked doors obsessively, imagining that tall man somewhere out there. Police chased leads across Michigan‚Äîtips from Detroit, sightings in Battle Creek‚Äîbut nothing stuck. Years later, they linked similar cases to known killers, like a man who worked at the hotel much later, convicted of other murders. But for Frances, no justice.

The island's beauty hides that darkness now. I never returned. The memory of those woods, the unseen footsteps, the stranger's shadow‚Äîit all lingers, a reminder that evil can strike anywhere, even in paradise.





# ""Echoes Across"":

I had been paddling these wild waters for years, hauling furs and supplies through the endless lakes and rivers of the north. That spring of 1736, I joined Sieur de La V√©rendrye's group at Fort Saint-Charles. My name doesn't matter much now, but back then, I was just another voyageur, strong in the arms and quick with the oar. We were a crew of twenty-one, sent east to fetch goods from Kaministiquia and Michilimackinac. Food was low, and the fort needed restocking bad. Leading us was young Jean-Baptiste de La V√©rendrye, the boss's son, a bold man in his twenties with a sharp eye for the land. With him came Father Aulneau, the Jesuit priest, calm and thoughtful, there to guide our souls on the trip.

We set off in three big canoes on June 3, loaded with what little we had left. The lake stretched out wide, dotted with rocky islands like forgotten stones in a giant's hand. Jean-Baptiste steered us steady, calling out directions as we cut through the water. ""Keep the rhythm, boys,"" he said during our first break, wiping sweat from his brow. ""We'll make good time if we push hard."" I nodded, sharing a bit of dried meat with the man next to me, Pierre. He was new to this, younger than most, and full of questions. ""Think we'll run into any trouble?"" Pierre asked, his voice low. I shrugged. ""The Sioux have been restless. Heard they blame us for arming the Crees against them. But we've got numbers, and we're armed. Should be fine.""

Father Aulneau sat nearby, his black robe tucked neat, reading from a small book. He looked up and smiled gently. ""Trust in the Lord, my sons. He watches over us in these vast places."" His words eased some of the worry, but I couldn't shake the feeling that eyes followed us from the distant shores. We'd heard stories at the fort‚Äîraids, ambushes. The Sioux were fierce warriors, quick and silent. Jean-Baptiste had even been made a chief by the Monsonis and Crees a while back, but that might have stirred bad blood with the others.

We paddled on for days, the lake growing wilder, the islands more scattered. On June 6, we spotted a small, flat island ahead, bare with just some scrubby trees and rocks. It seemed a good spot to camp for the night‚Äîsheltered enough, easy to defend if needed. ""We'll stop here,"" Jean-Baptiste announced as we pulled the canoes ashore. ""Rest up, eat what we have. Tomorrow, we push harder."" We set up quick: tents pitched, fire started for warmth and cooking. The men chatted as we worked. ""This place feels empty,"" one voyageur, Louis, muttered while tying down a canoe. ""Too quiet."" I agreed but kept it to myself, focusing on sharpening my knife.

As evening came, we gathered around the fire. Father Aulneau led a short prayer, his voice steady. ""Bless this journey, O Lord, and protect us from harm."" Jean-Baptiste shared plans for the route ahead. ""Once we get the supplies, we'll head back strong. The fort depends on us."" Pierre leaned in, excited. ""What's Michilimackinac like? Big trading post?"" Jean-Baptiste chuckled. ""Bigger than you've seen, lad. Full of people, goods from everywhere."" The talk turned light, stories of past trips, laughs about close calls with rapids. But underneath, tension lingered. I caught glimpses of movement in the trees‚Äîprobably just animals, I told myself.

Later, as most men settled into tents, I took first watch with two others. The fire crackled low, casting flickers on the rocks. ""Hear anything?"" I whispered to Henri, one of the watchers. He shook his head. ""Nothing but water lapping."" We sat alert, muskets ready. Hours passed slow. Then, a rustle‚Äîfaint, like feet on leaves. I stood, peering into the dark. ""Who's there?"" No answer. Henri gripped his weapon. ""Could be deer."" But my gut twisted different. I woke Jean-Baptiste quietly. ""Something's out there."" He rose, alert. ""Wake the others slow. Don't panic them.""

Before we could, shouts erupted‚Äîwar cries piercing the night. Arrows whistled through the air, thudding into tents and ground. Men scrambled out, grabbing axes and guns. ""Sioux!"" someone yelled. They came from the trees, dozens of them, painted for war, moving fast and low. Jean-Baptiste fired first, dropping one. ""Form a line! Protect the priest!"" Father Aulneau emerged, cross in hand, calling for peace. ""Stop this! We mean no harm!"" But the attackers surged, knives flashing, clubs swinging.

Chaos hit hard. I fired my musket, reloading quick as I could. Pierre fell beside me, an arrow in his chest, eyes wide in shock. ""Help..."" he gasped. I pulled him behind a rock, but more warriors closed in. Louis swung his axe, taking one down, but two more tackled him, blades rising and falling. Screams filled the air‚Äîmen begging, fighting back. Jean-Baptiste stood tall, shouting orders. ""Hold them off!"" He shot another, then grappled hand-to-hand, strong but outnumbered.

I took a slash to the arm, blood soaking my shirt, pain burning sharp. I stumbled back, dropping behind a boulder near the water's edge. Warriors overran the camp, tents collapsing under the assault. Father Aulneau knelt, praying aloud. ""Forgive them, Father..."" A warrior struck him down with a club, then an arrow pierced his side. He slumped, still clutching his cross.

Hiding, I pressed my hand to the wound, biting my lip to stay quiet. Through the rocks, I saw the horror unfold. Jean-Baptiste fought fierce, knife in hand now, but they surrounded him. One warrior stabbed deep, and he fell face down, body jerking. The Sioux decorated him with quill garters, a mock honor. Others dragged bodies, scalping some, cutting heads clean off. They arranged the heads in a circle, a grim ritual. Knives sliced chests open, arrows driven in post-kill. The ground ran red, the air thick with cries fading to gurgles.

I lay still, playing dead when a warrior passed close, his foot nearly on me. He poked at bodies nearby, but missed mine in the shadows. My heart raced so loud I feared he'd hear. Minutes stretched like hours, the attackers looting our canoes, taking weapons and supplies. Their voices murmured in a tongue I didn't know, low and triumphant. One laughed, holding up a stolen musket.

Finally, they piled into their canoes and paddled off, vanishing into the dark. I waited longer, breath shallow, pain throbbing. When sure they were gone, I crawled out. The camp was ruin‚Äîbodies mangled, tents torn, fire smoldering. Jean-Baptiste lay headless, his torso covered in wounds. Father Aulneau knelt frozen, chest split, arrow protruding. Pierre stared blank, life gone. I counted‚Äî all but me dead. Twenty slaughtered.

Tears mixed with blood on my face. I bandaged my arm with a torn shirt, gathered what food I could find. The island felt cursed now, every shadow a threat. What if they returned? I pushed a canoe into the water, weak but driven. Paddling alone, I headed back toward the fort, each stroke agony. Days blurred‚Äîhunger gnawing, wound festering. I imagined warriors behind every island, arrows ready.

When I reached Fort Saint-Charles, I collapsed at the gate. ""Massacre,"" I whispered to the guards. ""All gone... Sioux."" La V√©rendrye himself came, face paling as I told the tale. ""My son... the priest..."" He broke down, but ordered search parties. They found the bodies as I described‚Äîheads in a circle, scalps taken, horrors etched in flesh.

I healed slow, but the memories never faded. That island, now called Massacre Island, haunts me. The silence after the screams, the blood on the rocks, the way they arranged the dead like trophies. I warn every voyageur: the lakes hold dangers deeper than water. Stay vigilant, or end up like them‚Äîforgotten bones on a remote speck of land.

  




# ""Blood on the Lake"":

I had always loved the idea of getting away from everything, so when I planned my backpacking trip to Isle Royale, it felt like the perfect escape. The island sits out there in Lake Superior, far from any city, with trails that wind through thick woods and lead to quiet spots by the water. I took the ferry over, hiked in with my pack, and aimed for a campground called South Lake Desor. It's one of those remote places you can only reach on foot, about eleven miles from the nearest ranger station. No roads, no stores, just a few tent sites scattered around a small lake.

When I got there in the late afternoon, I picked a spot near the edge of the trees, far enough from the group sites to have some peace. I set up my tent, boiled water for a meal, and sat listening to the birds. That's when I noticed the other campers. Two men, one older, maybe in his sixties, with gray hair and a limp, and the other younger, around thirty, tall and thin. They had set up at the group site across the clearing, maybe a hundred yards away. Father and son, I figured, from the way they moved around each other‚Äîfamiliar, but stiff.

At first, it was nothing unusual. I heard snippets of talk as I ate my noodles. The older one said something like, ""You always do this, bring up old stuff when we're supposed to relax."" The younger one replied, sharp, ""Relax? How can I, with you dragging me out here like this solves anything?"" Their voices carried clear across the open space, echoing off the water. I tried not to eavesdrop, but in a place this quiet, every word stuck.

As the light faded, I zipped into my sleeping bag, figuring I'd read a bit by headlamp. But their argument picked up again. The older man's voice rose first: ""I've given you everything, and this is how you repay me? Running off, making bad choices?"" The younger one shot back, ""You think money fixes it? You ruined us, Dad. Mom left because of you."" It went on like that, back and forth, accusations flying. I lay there, staring at the tent ceiling, wondering if I should move campsites in the morning. Family fights happen, but this felt raw, like something boiling over.

Sometime after dark, it got worse. I heard footsteps crunching through the leaves, then the slam of what sounded like the outhouse door. A minute later, yelling started. The younger voice, loud and ragged: ""Why did you even bring me here? To lecture me more?"" The older one: ""Because you're falling apart, son. Look at yourself."" Then it turned ugly. ""I can't take this anymore,"" the younger one shouted. ""All your control, your lies."" I sat up, my pulse quickening. Their words cut through the night air, sharp as knives.

I peeked out of my tent flap, but it was too dark to see much‚Äîjust shadows moving near their fire pit. The argument spiraled. The older man said, ""Calm down, we're out here alone. No one to hear you act like this."" That sent a shiver through me. Alone? I was right here, but they didn't know that, or didn't care. The younger one laughed, bitter. ""Alone is right. Perfect place for it all to end."" What did he mean by that? I strained to listen, my hands gripping the tent fabric.

Hours passed, or it felt like it. The yelling stopped for a while, and I tried to sleep, but then it flared up again. Around midnight, I think‚Äîit was hard to check my watch without making noise‚Äîthe screams started. Real screams, not just angry words. The younger voice, unhinged: ""Go ahead and kill yourself! See if I care!"" Then the older one, pleading at first: ""Stop this, please. You're scaring me."" But it escalated. ""I'm going to kill myself,"" the younger one howled. ""I'm going to murder us all!"" Those words hung in the air, repeating in my head. Murder us all? There were only two of them. Or did he know about me?

I froze in my bag, every muscle tense. The screams went on for over an hour, echoing across the lake. At first, both voices mixed in, arguing, threatening. Then it was mostly the younger one, ranting alone. ""This ends tonight,"" he yelled. ""No more running."" I imagined him pacing, wild-eyed, maybe holding something‚Äîa knife from their camp kit, or worse. The island felt smaller then, trapping us all. No cell signal down here by the water, no way to call for help without hiking up to a ridge.

Finally, I couldn't stay put. I slipped out of my tent, quiet as I could, and crept closer through the trees. The ground was uneven, roots snagging my boots. I stopped behind a thick trunk, maybe fifty yards away now. Their tent glowed faintly from a lantern inside. Shadows moved against the fabric‚Äîone standing, one sitting. The younger man was still talking, lower now, but intense. ""You think you can fix this? It's too late. We're done."" The older one murmured something I couldn't catch, sounding weak, defeated. Then a thud, like something heavy falling. Silence followed, broken only by heavy breathing.

My mind raced. Was that a fight? Had he hurt him? I backed away, heart hammering, and grabbed my pack. I had to get out, find higher ground to make a call. The trail back was dark, but I knew the way‚Äîeleven miles to Windigo, where rangers might be. As I hurried off, I heard one last shout from behind: ""This is it!"" It chilled me deeper than the night air.

I hiked fast, flashlight beam bouncing ahead. Every rustle in the bushes made me jump‚Äîdeer, I told myself, or wind. But what if he followed? What if he saw me leave? The path climbed, twisted through dense forest. My legs burned, but I pushed on. After what seemed forever, I reached a high point with a weak signal. I dialed 911, voice shaking as I explained: the screams, the threats, the thud. The dispatcher promised to send help, but warned it would take time‚Äîrangers had to hike in.

I kept moving, not stopping until dawn broke. At Windigo, I collapsed at the visitor center, told the staff everything. They nodded, faces grave, and said teams were on the way. I waited there, sipping coffee, replaying it all. Had I imagined the worst? Or left them to something terrible?

Two days later, word came back. Rangers found the bodies at the site‚Äîboth men dead. The older one with wounds that looked inflicted, the younger one nearby, like he'd turned on himself after. Investigators pieced it together as a tragic breakdown, but details stayed sparse. No one else had been close enough to intervene. I gave my statement, described the voices, the words that still echo in my ears.

Now, months later, I can't shake it. That remote spot by the lake, meant for peace, turned into something dark. I wonder if I could have done more‚Äîyelled out, approached them. But in that isolation, with those threats ringing out, fear won. Isle Royale calls itself a wilderness paradise, but I know better now. Some places hold secrets that swallow people whole.",1,1756731270.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1n5nvpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n5nvpz/my_brother_and_his_girlfriend_need_to_move_out/,my brother and his girlfriend need to move out!,"
my first ever reddit post since nothings ever infuriated me the way this does and i need help.

my brother (20) and his girlfriend (19?) have been together for about a year id say, i‚Äôve never had a great relationship with my brother but it‚Äôs never been terrible. we‚Äôre just not super close. We had just started getting along and not fighting as much right before my brother and his girlfriend got together and at the beginning it was fine, but recently i‚Äôd say about the last 4 months maybe it has completely gotten out of hand. My brother doesn‚Äôt work, he was on work cover and eventually got a job volunteering to continue the work cover payments but only had it for about 2 months maybe even less, i would constantly hear him complaining about not having time to do anything or using his 3-4 hour shifts that were 3 days a week as an excuse to why he left our shared bathroom or the whole house a complete mess. This whole two or so months, i (17) had been working 45-50 hour weeks while finishing year 12 and my certificate and doing everything i would usually/ needed to do around the house. he was on work cover for a hand injury i‚Äôm unaware of the degree however he was perfectly fine to be at the skatepark 4-5 hours a day, at one point he even fell off his skateboard and broke that same hand. my point i‚Äôm trying to get across isn‚Äôt about this at all though i‚Äôm just trying to show that he has literally no responsibility much like his girlfriend who also doesn‚Äôt work last i heard.

the problem is that she fucking lives here. he never once asked my mum is she could move in, she spreads her shit from his bedroom to the dining room and doesn‚Äôt clean up after herself. we live in a three bedroom unit, we live with my mum, my brother, myself and my little sister, we moved in when my little sister was young and still sleeping in mums room with the plan that my brother would move out in time for her to have his old room. my sister hates sharing a room, shes 9 and when my mums boyfriend comes over (6 days a week every 2 weeks, fifo work) she used to sleep in my room but now shes so fed up with sharing a bed she has made the couch into her bed.

my brother and his girlfriend don‚Äôt pay rent, my brother used to but since rarely pays, my mum has to leave a note on the kitchen asking him to pay as she is working 2 jobs at the moment and can barely afford it. i pay her $70-$100 a week but that is mostly paying back for my car and i cannot afford anymore as i too work 2 jobs paying for my insurance and rego and saving for university. all of the groceries she buys my brother and his girlfriend take it as a invitation so much so i have started buying my own which have disappeared more than once no matter how big i write my name on them. the girlfriend recently bought a massive bread maker and slapped it down in the middle of our very small kitchen and is caught at every hour of the day ROLLEESKATING around leaving every utensil, plate and cooking item dirty just placed in or around the sink. they both constantly leave there clothes either piled in mine and my brother shared bathrooms bath tub or thrown somewhere in the laundry spilling out into the dining room. she brings her arts and crafts box and dumps in on the dining room floor right next to her shoes and anything she brings along with her. she is always in our house by herself and when i come home she acts like i‚Äôm in her way, she blares her tv shows acting like she lives here and dumps her dirty underwear everywhere. she has accused me of ‚Äúcrushing mints into her contacts‚Äù and when i promised i‚Äôd never do that she went on to accuse my little sister.

another thing, she has spoken about 30 words combined to me, my mum, step dad and sister in the time shes been ‚Äúliving here‚Äù.

in the bathroom that me and my brother share she has taken up both shelves in the shower meaning she has taken all of my shampoos/ conditioner and body wash and replaced it with hers, she has also taken my femfresh (vagina wash) twice now and this time i haven‚Äôt gotten it back. MY clothes (brand new gstring and pj top) have appeared in their laundry when i eventually went through it since both those things had been missing pretty much since the day i bought them. A while ago i bought a 6 pack of deodorant from costco and started using all of them at a similar time, so they were all open but none of them were fully used, i noticed recently 3 were missing and one day when they‚Äôre door was open due to the sheer amount of shit spewing out of their room i spotted my fucking deodorant on my brothers table. this isn‚Äôt even a huge problem i would have no issue with letting her borrow my things (gstring and femfresh is where i draw the line though) it‚Äôs just the fact she acts as if she‚Äôs entitled to it. they both leave the dehydrater on for weeks on end with as little as a single banana in it. they leave dirty dishes out they take my wet washing from the dryer and replace it with theirs.

the reason im posting this is that i feel terrible for my mum, at this point there is nothing i can do, they leech off her and give her nothing in return not even respect in her own house. she pays all the bills while barely making enough for rent the most i can do is $100 a week which barely takes any of the weight off of her and clean up after myself, i‚Äôm done cleaning their mess, she has started letting me keep my things in her bathroom as use it as i need since i can barely walk into my own.

a few weeks ago my mum hurt her leg very bad, she was keeping my sister home from school to help her with things (bring her water/ food, clean up a bit ect) she couldn‚Äôt walk and although my dad was able to help with my sister he had a baby on the way so he could only do so much. my mum asked my brother to make her a coffee and he huffed and he walked down the stairs and a little later they got into a huge argument about everything. he was saying ‚Äúanything he does is not good enough‚Äù (correct x) and that ‚Äúeveryone has a go at him all the time‚Äù. he literally could not help my mother with the most simple thing while she was unable to do anything. the house and kitchen was a state that whole week and since i was at work most of the time so i could make a bit extra to send her as she wouldn‚Äôt be getting payed, nothing got cleaned.

my mum has tried to speak to him, my dad, my grandfather, my step mum, my step dad they have all tried but nothing will fucking change him, can anyone tell me what to do, he takes everything as an attack, his girlfriend is so disrespectful and has made him a lot worse since ‚Äúmoving in‚Äù they both do nothing all day. my mum recently cleaned out the garage for her new car so there is room for two. we live in a complex where if you park in any other park other than the two you are given your car will get towed and since he is home all the time he takes her park leaving her to park outside and me to park in the outside carpark (5 min walk). i work late most nights and as a 17 yo girl it‚Äôs quite scary walking from that carpark into my complex but he doesn‚Äôt seem to get it since it inconveniences him. he drills random pieces of wood together and says it‚Äôs a project and chucks them in the garage in a spot so he can park because his car is small but not my mum with her slightly bigger car. the outside freezer is stuffed with his moulding food and if anyone else puts stuff they bought in it will be gone instantly.

his girlfriend leaves the house key in the door unlocked for anyone to acsess.

they put their dirty washing basket in my room for some reason and my assigned towel rack has FOUR of his towels stacked on it the instant my towels are in the wash or my room.

please if anyone knows what to do help would be much appreciated. i want to help my mum. we are planning to move out and in with my step dad in January but it‚Äôs still a little bit away and i see my mum getting more and more upset and disrespected. they will not be invited to live with us as my brother and his girlfriend don‚Äôt communicate with my stepdad and my dad and step mum and new baby will also be moving and they‚Äôre not invited to move with them. i‚Äôm upset because i so wish me and my brother got along how i do with my other siblings and step siblings but it‚Äôs just like he only thinks about himself.

if anyone is dealing with a similar issue pls comment i beg and please if anyone knows what i or my mum or anyone can do please let me know.

much love üíï",1,1756731167.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1n5nvms,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1n5nvms/a_few_of_my_personal_experiences_interacting_with/,A Few of my Personal Experiences Interacting With My Dead Wife,"I'm going to share some personal stories of my interactions with my dead wife. These were all documented on my blog and in a couple of FB groups at the time they occurred. I know I'm just some random guy on the internet, but these are all 100% true stories. Judge what they mean for yourself.

**1.**¬†[What I Learned From My First Astral Projection Visit With My Dead Wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Afterlife_Exists/comments/1m80ft5/what_i_learned_from_my_first_astral_projection/)¬†\- I wrote this here about 5 months ago, I'll just link to it. I physically visited with my wife while fully conscious. 

**2 The Mountain Lodge**\- During a very intense and long-lasting dream, my wife showed me our home in the astral. It was a big mountain lodge with an amazing view of snow-capped mountains. She gave me a tour of the place, My vision was exceptionally sharp and I could see all this amazing detail. When I woke up I wrote this down in my blog and in a couple of FB groups, and specifically used the term ""mountain lodge.""

Later that day I turned on the TV and turned it to the channel to watch Wheel of Fortune with her, but I was a few minutes late and paused it immediately, but it was after the first puzzle where Pat was interviewing contestants. I was disappointed and apologized to her that we missed the first puzzle. I quickly made dinner while the TV was paused (DISH service.) When I came back in the room the TV show was not paused where I had paused it, on Pat's interviews; it looked to be on a commercial. I unpaused it, and after the commercial ended the beginning of the show started, which should have been impossible.

One of the solutions to a puzzle in that show was **""Mountain Lodge.""**

**3. The Allen Wrenches**¬†\- My daughter, her boyfriend and son were visiting and putting together a new swing bench I had ordered. Those things usually come with the cheap little tools you need to put them together, but this one didn't have the allen wrench that was necessary. I had a few loose allen wrenches somewhere, but we couldn't find them.

During the course of our search, each of us opened and looked through my small toolbox, which has a hinged lid with sloping sides and a 1 inch flat apex where the handle was connected. We each opened the toolbox, swiveling the lid up - a total of four times. My daughter was walking down the hallway and asked my dead wife to show her where the allen wrenches were. She got the urge to look into the toolbox again, and when she got there, there was a brand new, unopened package of allen wrenches perched on the top of the handle of the closed toolbox. It had the size we needed. There was nothing above the toolbox where anything could have dropped onto it.

Needless to say, we were all totally amazed.

**4. The Drawings in the Coffee**¬†\- Starting with the day after my wife died, I continued to pour her a cup of coffee every morning as part of my PTSD-relief therapy. I always make her coffee the same way with a half packet of Sweet N Low and a tiny bit of milk. Later I noticed what looked to me like a flower appeared in the cup at the top of the coffee, apparently ""drawn"" with the milk. This kept appearing every day in her coffee, and it was tied into another huge set of ""flower"" signs, that I got but won't get into those here.

It didn't matter where I set the coffee, what time of year, which fans or AC units I had on or off, this drawing would appear. On a handful of times it would be a drawing of something else - once it looked like a cabin on a hillside. These other ""drawings"" would correspond to dreams I had or other interactions with her, but it was almost always some version of a radiant flower, or occasionally a 3D looking flower.

At one point I was convinced it had to be the particular geometry of the cup itself and physics that was producing these drawings every single day. After I had recovered from the grief, one morning I poured her coffee and told her, out loud, that she could stop doing the drawings because I was feeling much better. I fully expected the drawing to appear because some part of me thought it was surely just physics causing it to occur anyway.

No drawing at all appeared that day, just a perfectly smooth brown surface.

The next day, no drawing. Smooth surface, no features at all.

At this point I felt a bit of regret and panic because I realized it WAS her. I told her, out loud, that I was wrong about not needing the drawing any more, and to please go back to drawing the flower.

The next day, the flower appeared, just like before.

These are very bright, highly detailed drawings, with incredible detail - far beyond anything you see at a Starbucks, with dozens and dozens - perhaps over a hundred - of very fine lines.

I've made it a habit to keep checking on the progress of the drawing. It appears in different ways - sometimes, you can see the whole thing beginning to appear very faintly. Other times, it begins with what looks like a faint swirl. Other times, it appears to ""bloom"" out from the base of the flower, like it is growing during the course of the day.[¬†Here is a blog post](https://www.redstringsociety.com/post/stunning-new-image-in-her-coffee)¬†I made about this where I posted a few pictures of these drawings.

A couple of times, I poured the coffee and forgot about it until near the end of the day, and after twelve hours there was absolutely nothing in the coffee. On those occasions I said something to the effect of, 'Hey, where's the flower, babe? You taking the day off?"" On each of those occasions I checked back 1-2 hours later and the flower was there.

This may be hard to believe, but I have literally had hundreds of these kinds of experiences over the past 8+ years. They became so prolific I just stopped writing them down, there are just too many of them. Writing them all down would be a full-time job.",2,1756731161.0,widowers,1,0.75,False

1. Mayar: this was the first arab fragrance I got and it was just meh in the beginning I was also thinking about returning it but kept it and after 1 month this has turned so pretty and become one my favs. It's a very juicy fruity floral fragrance good for summer. Lasts for almost 12-15 hours on me. 10/9.5
2. Kingdom her: hated it, almost returned this one but kept it and now after 1 month maceration, oh my god this has become so so good. It's not a bubbly or childish fragrance It's quite mature but in a good way. Can be worn in summers and evening. Little similar to angham in the opening but dry down completely different. Lasts for 6-7 hours. 10/9.5
3. Khamrah: was so excited to get this one, tried it, loved it, left for maceration for 2 weeks, tried again and hated it. It became way to strong and sweet that it was hurting my nose and throat. Returned it. Last for so long almost 24 hours. 10/4
4. Khamrah qahwa: again hated it but after maceration turned so so good. Not as sweet as khamrah and the coffee note is present but very mild. Lasts for good 10 hours.10/9
5. Musamam white intense: again hated this one too and it smelled like cleaning supplies, hotel room, laundry but after maceration become one my top 3 fragrance. Smells really expensive. Feels like youre in a very beachside luxury resort. Wearing it right now. Last for 5-6 hours.10/10
6. Eclaire: just alcohol, couldn't smell anything other than alcohol after 2 weeks become very delicious gourmand. Lasts for 5-6 hours. 10/9
7. Chocomusk: gosh what the hell was this perfume, even after spraying 20-30 times couldn't get anything, it only smelled like machine oil mix alcohol topped with a hint of cocoa powder which would disappear in 2 minutes. Now after a month it's a little better but that machine oil smell is still there very sweet and very cheap smelling Last for 30 minutes max no matter how much I spray. 10/3
8. Angham: I don't what I was expecting but whatever it is I don't like this even after a month this is still the same just stronger. Not a bad fragrance but not worth the hype or maybe I should give it some more time but if it stays the same I don't see myself using it. Smells like cheap lavender powder. Last for 3-4 hours. 10/4

1n5ntmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n5ntmb/how_could_i_m20_make_a_long_distance_relationship/,How could I (M20) make a long distance relationship work with someone (F23) I met abroad?,"I met a japanease girl (im from Spain) in an international campus I went for two weeks in the UK. We discovered we shared a big passion for books and bonded over that, talking a lot by chat even if we saw each other everyday. Like three days before I had to leave to my country, she asked me if we could spend some hours together alone before I left, visiting a bookshop we both have been to several times separately or at least have a coffee. I of course said yes and thats exactly what happened. Its a day I will always remember, even if it rained a lot and we got wet.

 Since that day I realized I might like her and honestly I dont know how mutual that is, as Im pretty bad at this things + her culture is a lot more reserved , but she started to be more in places she knew I would be, even if she didnt go before, or touched me lightly while laughing and things like that. We said goodbye at least 6 times the last day because she had to go to visit another city the day I left and we didnt know when exactly would be our last moment together. In what ended been our last goodbye I asked her for a hug (something I was shy to do before because I know its not common in her culture, as she told me later) , and before I could even finish the sentence she said ""yes of course"" and huged me very fast for only around 2 seconds.

The day before I left we also signed each other UK flags (something everyone did there before leaving) and I told her she will always have someone in the other corner of the world to recommend books to and I hope I can see her again in her country so we repeat the day we were alone together . She just said it was very sweet and nothing else, but before I left she admitted me she read it several times the night before and was very moved by it.

The thing is that I got back to my country two days ago and now Im devastated , not only because of her but because of all the amazing people I met there and will probably never see again in person. About her, she told me to tell her my thoughts about a short story she recommened me (and I plan to read today or tomorrow) so I guess she wants to stay in touch. 

As I havent read it yet, since I left I only wrote her asking how was a football match she saw yesterday and she only said it was fun and havent answered my answer to that for a day (without leaving on read)
But I guess I shouldnt be worried about that.

The thing is, I dont know if she likes me as we didnt discuss anything about that, but I at least want to be long distance friends and I definetly want to stay in touch with her, but I know its not for everyone and most times one of them will stop answering and Im afraid of getting expectations that wont happen, like continue talking frequently or even seeing each other again.

Sorry if this looks more like venting than searching for advice,  but this is all very new for me and would like to hear advice from people who lived similar things so they can tell me what they did, or if you havent, what would you do in my case. 

Do you think a long distance friendship/relationship that is so far could work? How could I make it work? Or its better if I just dont get too attached? ",2,1756731010.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Tamoxifen side effects have actually gotten WORSE after a year of being on this med (hot flashes to the max). One year and a few months out from active treatment. NO ONE in my immediate family visited during active treatment (they are 3 hours away). They didn't even send food, flowers, or tea. Just empty texts. My father has a major mental illness that poisons the rest of the household still living there. My parents are now very elderly and I don't want to be their caregiver as it would destroy my entire mental health. My sibling has the same mental illness as my father but he treats it and still he goes through phases of 6 months on-wards of not speaking to me at all. I'm sure all the trash talking my father does about me doesn't help.

Also of note: I went bankrupt from cancer treatment (despite having a job and health insurance) and no one cared.

Still re: active treatment: NO ONE in my immediate family even said ""I can't be there after surgery, but checking to see you have someone?"" They didn't care! The most I got was ""good luck with that"" texts. My local friend pool was lame too. I had a ""close"" friend, let's call her Z., who couldn't be bothered to show up to a Zoom meeting upon DX where I explained how I wanted things to go and type of support needed, leaving me to fill her in on everything after.

Z. never once drove me to radiation, and after surgery, cross country friends did the heavy lifting and visited and she stopped by when the storm had passed to meet me for coffee or lunches. It wasn't that she wasn't around, she was, but not in helpful ways unless I begged. Recently during my birthday this summer, she mocked a friend visiting me, calling him my ""FWB"" instead of celebrating that I wasn't alone on my birthday. Z. had an unplanned pregnancy and is a new mother. I attended her baby shower (painful) and provided a gift and mailed her one, NO thank you. I lent her a rolling cart  from my job for when she moved, she lost the lid, and now my work stuff gets rained on.  I explained to her that the idea of pregnancy is very complicated for me now being in my 40's AND being on an estrogen blocking during & the risks of going off it ""I couldn't imagine not being a mother!"" Umm ok, glad she was always healthy enough to have the choice. I wasn't.

So now that I am ""fine now"" (lol, total joke, I am SO not fine) because I'm out of active treatment, people are rolling around with their shennangians. IDGAF. My mother texts me yesterday to announce my uncle is in hospice (yes, via text she announces this). I already decided I won't be attending services when it comes to that; my family is trash (I liked my uncle tho) and I've had enough trauma for a lifetime without being forced to cry with people I don't like. My mother is constantly reminding me of distant relatives birthdays now too, in theory-so I won't be ""alone"" when she's not around but B\*tch please, I've always been alone.

Z. has now gotten obsessive. Of note she is from this area and her entire family and life-long friends live here. Why she is calling me first thing on a Saturday morning is bizzare. Her leaning on me for any emotional support right now is selfish and misguided. I guess last time she weekend called it was to announce she was in my city (we live 25 min away) like I am supposed to care?

She called me the other weekend early Saturday morning as if I had nothing else to do. Bear in mind I haven't seen her since May and don't want to. The issues I have surrounding being long-term single when I don't want to be are real and painful and she's dissmissive of that too, meanwhile, she has a baby, first try!! Not even trying... just oopss, my body functions so well I am pregnant with no effort. When she called that other weekend, I didn't pick up I texted her days later explaining I was slammed on a work trip, she responds to pepper me with questions. I ignore. Then yesterday (\*also Sat morning) she calls me FIRST THING twice in a row. I don't answer. I text her hours later to explain I am not available and busy with school and work. She responds ""hope all is well!"" LOL! All isn't well, bi\*ch. I had cancer it was traumatic and terrible and it's like nobody saw it because they didn't want to.

It's been lonely and quiet here.

I am making space for better people to enter into my life.

Life is for living. My parents may be elderly, but I am not. I already had so many stolen years due to this f\*cking disease, not just the 6 months of active treatment, but the after shock. Them texting about someone entering hospice isn't ok. Them thinking I'm their peer or in their cohort isn't accurate, I am half their age. Yes, my mother had this fu\*king disease too, but she had it at 70 something...not 40. Not before I found true love or the right career or a home to live and had so much more living to do. She had time to make her choices and I had so many choices stolen from me.",10,1756730623.0,breastcancer,5,0.86,False

You see, people think I‚Äôm just another forensic blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro, the quiet guy in khakis with the neatly ironed shirts and a polite smile, someone who blends into the fluorescent-lit hallways and pretends to laugh at Masuka‚Äôs tasteless jokes. But beneath that mask ‚Äî beneath the carefully rehearsed nods, the perfectly timed chuckles, the artificial small talk about weather and office doughnuts ‚Äî there‚Äôs something else. Something dark. Something primal. A passenger that never pays for gas, that never shuts up, that whispers and scratches at the inside of my skull like a stray cat begging to be let in. My Dark Passenger. And while most people find comfort in church pews, family barbecues, or a warm embrace after a long day, I find mine in the meticulous placement of plastic wrap, the faint metallic scent of sharpened blades, the hush of duct tape sealing away a scream before it can ever be born.

I don‚Äôt kill because I want to. I kill because I have to. That‚Äôs what Harry drilled into me with every stern lecture, every late-night drive to crime scenes, every trembling finger that pointed at mugshots of monsters who walked free. He built me into a weapon ‚Äî not for justice, not for morality, but for survival. A weapon that looks like a man, talks like a man, pays bills and files reports like a man, but isn‚Äôt. Not really. Because while you‚Äôre worrying about deadlines, or mortgage payments, or whether your neighbor is judging your lawn ornaments, I‚Äôm wondering how deep arterial spray will travel from a femoral cut at a 43-degree angle. I‚Äôm wondering how many layers of Glad Wrap it takes before the struggling stops echoing through the rafters of an abandoned warehouse. I‚Äôm wondering if you, yes you reading this right now, could pass Harry‚Äôs Code ‚Äî or if I‚Äôd already be sketching your face onto a blood slide before you even realize the monster is sitting across from you at a dinner party.

People say monsters hide under the bed. They‚Äôre wrong. Monsters learn to smile. Monsters wear badges. Monsters carry donuts into the break room and ask how your weekend went. And sometimes ‚Äî monsters write blood reports in triplicate while dreaming of the next time their knife slides home with the kind of precision that even surgeons envy. I am Dexter Morgan. I am father, brother, coworker, neighbor. I am the friendly face who helps you move a couch up three flights of stairs. I am the guy who remembers your birthday and brings you coffee just the way you like it. I am the hollow shell that mimics everything you want me to be. And when the lights go out and the city drowns itself in sweat and sirens, I am the last shadow you‚Äôll ever see, the one wrapping you tighter than any embrace, the one reminding you that justice is a myth but ritual is forever.

1n5nlpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisrespectfulCunts/comments/1n5nlpg/my_brother_and_his_girlfriend_need_to_move_out/,my brother and his girlfriend need to move out!,"my first ever reddit post since nothings ever infuriated me the way this does and i need help.

my brother (20) and his girlfriend (19?) have been together for about a year id say, i‚Äôve never had a great relationship with my brother but it‚Äôs never been terrible. we‚Äôre just not super close. We had just started getting along and not fighting as much right before my brother and his girlfriend got together and at the beginning it was fine, but recently i‚Äôd say about the last 4 months maybe it has completely gotten out of hand. My brother doesn‚Äôt work, he was on work cover and eventually got a job volunteering to continue the work cover payments but only had it for about 2 months maybe even less, i would constantly hear him complaining about not having time to do anything or using his 3-4 hour shifts that were 3 days a week as an excuse to why he left our shared bathroom or the whole house a complete mess. This whole two or so months, i (17) had been working 45-50 hour weeks while finishing year 12 and my certificate and doing everything i would usually/ needed to do around the house. he was on work cover for a hand injury i‚Äôm unaware of the degree however he was perfectly fine to be at the skatepark 4-5 hours a day, at one point he even fell off his skateboard and broke that same hand. my point i‚Äôm trying to get across isn‚Äôt about this at all though i‚Äôm just trying to show that he has literally no responsibility much like his girlfriend who also doesn‚Äôt work last i heard. 

the problem is that she fucking lives here. he never once asked my mum is she could move in, she spreads her shit from his bedroom to the dining room and doesn‚Äôt clean up after herself. we live in a three bedroom unit, we live with my mum, my brother, myself and my little sister, we moved in when my little sister was young and still sleeping in mums room with the plan that my brother would move out in time for her to have his old room. my sister hates sharing a room, shes 9 and when my mums boyfriend comes over (6 days a week every 2 weeks, fifo work) she used to sleep in my room but now shes so fed up with sharing a bed she has made the couch into her bed. 

my brother and his girlfriend don‚Äôt pay rent, my brother used to but since rarely pays, my mum has to leave a note on the kitchen asking him to pay as she is working 2 jobs at the moment and can barely afford it. i pay her $70-$100 a week but that is mostly paying back for my car and i cannot afford anymore as i too work 2 jobs paying for my insurance and rego and saving for university. all of the groceries she buys my brother and his girlfriend take it as a invitation so much so i have started buying my own which have disappeared more than once no matter how big i write my name on them. the girlfriend recently bought a massive bread maker and slapped it down in the middle of our very small kitchen and is caught at every hour of the day ROLLEESKATING around leaving every utensil, plate and cooking item dirty just placed in or around the sink. they both constantly leave there clothes either piled in mine and my brother shared bathrooms bath tub or thrown somewhere in the laundry spilling out into the dining room. she brings her arts and crafts box and dumps in on the dining room floor right next to her shoes and anything she brings along with her. she is always in our house by herself and when i come home she acts like i‚Äôm in her way, she blares her tv shows acting like she lives here and dumps her dirty underwear everywhere. she has accused me of ‚Äúcrushing mints into her contacts‚Äù and when i promised i‚Äôd never do that she went on to accuse my little sister. 

another thing, she has spoken about 30 words combined to me, my mum, step dad and sister in the time shes been ‚Äúliving here‚Äù. 

in the bathroom that me and my brother share she has taken up both shelves in the shower meaning she has taken all of my shampoos/ conditioner and body wash and replaced it with hers, she has also taken my femfresh (vagina wash) twice now and this time i haven‚Äôt gotten it back. MY clothes (brand new gstring and pj top) have appeared in their laundry when i eventually went through it since both those things had been missing pretty much since the day i bought them. A while ago i bought a 6 pack of deodorant from costco and started using all of them at a similar time, so they were all open but none of them were fully used, i noticed recently 3 were missing and one day when they‚Äôre door was open due to the sheer amount of shit spewing out of their room i spotted my fucking deodorant on my brothers table. this isn‚Äôt even a huge problem i would have no issue with letting her borrow my things (gstring and femfresh is where i draw the line though) it‚Äôs just the fact she acts as if she‚Äôs entitled to it. they both leave the dehydrater on for weeks on end with as little as a single banana in it. they leave dirty dishes out they take my wet washing from the dryer and replace it with theirs. 

the reason im posting this is that i feel terrible for my mum, at this point there is nothing i can do, they leech off her and give her nothing in return not even respect in her own house. she pays all the bills while barely making enough for rent the most i can do is $100 a week which barely takes any of the weight off of her and clean up after myself, i‚Äôm done cleaning their mess, she has started letting me keep my things in her bathroom as use it as i need since i can barely walk into my own. 

a few weeks ago my mum hurt her leg very bad, she was keeping my sister home from school to help her with things (bring her water/ food, clean up a bit ect) she couldn‚Äôt walk and although my dad was able to help with my sister he had a baby on the way so he could only do so much. my mum asked my brother to make her a coffee and he huffed and he walked down the stairs and a little later they got into a huge argument about everything. he was saying ‚Äúanything he does is not good enough‚Äù (correct x) and that ‚Äúeveryone has a go at him all the time‚Äù. he literally could not help my mother with the most simple thing while she was unable to do anything. the house and kitchen was a state that whole week and since i was at work most of the time so i could make a bit extra to send her as she wouldn‚Äôt be getting payed, nothing got cleaned. 

my mum has tried to speak to him, my dad, my grandfather, my step mum, my step dad they have all tried but nothing will fucking change him, can anyone tell me what to do, he takes everything as an attack, his girlfriend is so disrespectful and has made him a lot worse since ‚Äúmoving in‚Äù they both do nothing all day. my mum recently cleaned out the garage for her new car so there is room for two. we live in a complex where if you park in any other park other than the two you are given your car will get towed and since he is home all the time he takes her park leaving her to park outside and me to park in the outside carpark (5 min walk). i work late most nights and as a 17 yo girl it‚Äôs quite scary walking from that carpark into my 
complex but he doesn‚Äôt seem to get it since it inconveniences him. he drills random pieces of wood together and says it‚Äôs a project and chucks them in the garage in a spot so he can park because his car is small but not my mum with her slightly bigger car. the outside freezer is stuffed with his moulding food and if anyone else puts stuff they bought in it will be gone instantly. 

his girlfriend leaves the house key in the door unlocked for anyone to acsess. 

they put their dirty washing basket in my room for some reason and my assigned towel rack has FOUR of his towels stacked on it the instant my towels are in the wash or my room.

please if anyone knows what to do help would be much appreciated. i want to help my mum. we are planning to move out and in with my step dad in January but it‚Äôs still a little bit away and i see my mum getting more and more upset and disrespected. they will not be invited to live with us as my brother and his girlfriend don‚Äôt communicate with my stepdad and my dad and step mum and new baby will also be moving and they‚Äôre not invited to move with them. i‚Äôm upset because i so wish me and my brother got along how i do with my other siblings and step siblings but it‚Äôs just like he only thinks about himself. 

if anyone is dealing with a similar issue pls comment i beg and please if anyone knows what i or my mum or anyone can do please let me know.

much love üíï

These aren‚Äôt just collabs‚Äîthey‚Äôre legit companies built from personal brand power. This breakdown (inspired by **The Influencer Marketing Factory**) shows how creators are scaling their digital influence into thriving ventures.

# Top 10 Influencers Creating Their Own Companies

|Rank|Influencer|Company / Brand Founded|What Makes It Stand Out|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Addison Rae|Item Beauty|Affordable makeup & skincare with Gen-Z-friendly vibes.|
|2|Emma Chamberlain|Chamberlain Coffee|Relatable, aesthetic coffee brand that feels like Emma‚Äôs personality in a mug.|
|3|Charli & Dixie D‚ÄôAmelio|Social Tourist|A fashion-forward label blending Gen-Z style with viral credibility.|
|4|Hyram Yarbro (Hyram)|Selfless Skincare Line|Skincare rooted in sincere education and ethical values.|
|5|Olivia O‚ÄôNeill|Motel Rocks (collaboration)|Fashion collab marrying influencer style with fast fashion flair.|

|9|Blair Walnuts|En Route Jewelry|Curated jewelry line backed by her aesthetic authority.|
|10|Michelle Khare|Fitness App|App-based fitness programs blending personal training with influencer engagement.|

# Why These Ventures Thrive

* **Authenticity + Audience = Instant Startup Buzz** These influencers don‚Äôt just launch brands; they bring communities. Their followers are not just customers‚Äîthey‚Äôre a ready-made focus group.
* **Built-In Marketing Machine** No need for big ad spend‚Äîjust a TikTok, IG reel, or YouTube video, and products go viral.
* **Niche & Identity Matter** Each brand reflects the creator‚Äôs identity: Emma's cozy aesthetic becomes Chamberlain Coffee; Hyram‚Äôs dermatologist-adjacent content evolves into Selfless skincare.
* **Multiplying Revenue Streams** Beyond brand deals, launching a company gives influencers equity, control, and scalability across product lines or platforms.
* **Longevity Beyond a Single Platform** These companies give them business legs far beyond trends or algorithm shifts.

# Final Thoughts

This wave of influencer-founded companies isn‚Äôt just about cashing in‚Äîit‚Äôs about creators owning and shaping their own narratives in business. From beauty to coffee, fitness to fashion, they‚Äôre building brands with built-in culture and communities. It‚Äôs the next evolution of the creator economy‚Äîand the takeover is just heating up.

Just a guy who misses and looking for a girl that is fine with a casual intimacy. A girl who misses being touch, getting dominated, and getting babied in bed. A someone fine with being casual and not ready to commit in relationship. 

A someone that is not too aggressive, just a normal or soft girl that wants to be submissive. A girl that is open for giving blowjobs and hanjobs.

I'm open for inexperienced girls that wants to try getting eaten, fingers, or getting a dick inside you.

It could be a one time thing or a long term casual intimacy. Pero it's much nicer if it's long term.

I always assumed credit cards are for people who spend a lot, travel abroad, swipe for lakhs, collect reward points, lounge access and all. Mujhe laga mere liye toh kuch nahi hai.

Then one day in office, I saw a colleague paying through UPI but instead of the money going from her bank directly she was using a credit card. I was so confused ki yeh kaise possible hai so I asked her. That‚Äôs when she told me about the Supermoney UPI Credit Card.

The thing that caught my attention was how simple it sounded. No joining fees, nothing complicated. You just pay through UPI like you normally do and instead of thinking ki bhai points kab redeem honge it directly gives cashback into your account. Literally 3% back on the same small spends I was already making like groceries, Swiggy orders, autos, cab rides, coffee runs. I didn‚Äôt have to change my habits at all. Aur upar se the usual 1% fuel surcharge waiver is also there so it feels like small wins keep adding up.

It‚Äôs been about 4 months since I started using it and honestly it feels chill. Every month I notice that little cashback sitting in my account and it just feels rewarding without me having to chase or track anything and for someone like me who‚Äôs not a heavy spender and just does regular chhoti chhoti UPI payments daily this card has been a really nice surprise.

UPI is already such a normal part of life and now combining it with a credit card that actually gives real cashback has been a plus. I‚Äôm genuinely glad I came across it so early in my career because it makes me feel a little smarter with money without making things complicated.

I picked this setup because there aren‚Äôt many luggage rack options out there, and I didn‚Äôt want to wait. The Pelican box is great‚Äîit‚Äôs secure for locking up stuff in the city, looks good, and gets the job done. If you‚Äôre thinking about doing this, it‚Äôs a solid choice.

Drilling 4 holes in my new fender was a bit nerve-wracking. I stared at it for a while, and my wife kept asking if I was actually working on it or just spacing out. Use a small drill bit and go from the bottom up to keep the holes clean. Added some spacers, bolted the box on, and it sits perfect. I also integrated turn signals into the rack but forget to get a photo of that but they look really good.

I put a bungee net on top to hold packages for my e-commerce business‚ÄîI daily drop a lot of packages at the post office, this bike‚Äôs a business write-off for it.

I‚Äôm planning to 3D print some organizer stuff like sandwich holders, glove holders, and maybe a spot for my coffee for when we hit the state parks.

* Pretty good career (Software Development) I quite like pushing myself in.
* I take decent care of myself ‚Äì I exercise regularly, eat well, lost a lot of weight, have engaged with therapy, and like to dress well.
* I am too smart for my own good ‚Äì this can mean noticing and remembering every tiny detail about someone‚Äôs behaviour and ‚Äòpattern matching‚Äô very quickly, learning things in no time, or just being interested in interrogating every nuance of an idea of line of thinking.
* I lead in everything I do, at work and socially. This has never really been by choice, but I always step up when others step back.
* I have endless amounts of time and effort for people I value, and am loyal to a fault once I‚Äôve decided someone is worthwhile
* I value vulnerability, connection, and openness in both directions ‚Äì I want to know everything there is to know about you, warts and all, and welcome your curiosity about me. I won‚Äôt say ‚Äòjudgement free‚Äô ‚Äì everyone judges everyone for everything, but I will always try to understand and build a better picture of ‚Äòyou,‚Äô not push you away for things that happened in your past.

**About me: Potential Downsides**

* Some emotional baggage ‚Äì Not the best childhood, long marriage, life ups and downs. I‚Äôve been in therapy, worked on myself, and all that, but there are scars and pressure points.
* I overthink things to a fault, and sometimes need or seek ‚Äòpermission‚Äô to express myself, or work things out ‚Äòout loud.‚Äô
* I have a 4 year old. He‚Äôs awesome, but eats up a lot of time. I won‚Äôt apologise for this.
* I like to play ‚Äòdevil‚Äôs advocate‚Äô and have contentious discussions in a good natured way. Some people find this antagonistic.
* I‚Äôm not looking for daily adventures, extensive travel, or saying ‚Äòyes‚Äô to everything ‚Äì honestly, I‚Äôm pretty happy to be introverts together a lot of the time.

**The sort of person I think I‚Äôm looking for**

* You‚Äôre quite bright, have your own interests and opinions, and love exploring ideas even when people don‚Äôt agree.
* You have one or more passions ‚Äì your career, a hobby, anything you can just be excited about.
* You want to try to make a genuine connection, even though that means trusting someone and being that little bit vulnerable even though we both know it might hurt.
* I don‚Äôt really mind your age or appearance. I mean, attraction is important and I‚Äôm happy to share pictures and all that, but if I‚Äôm not attracted to someone mentally/emotionally (or, on the contrary, if I AM attracted to them mentally/emotionally), nothing physical will change that.

**About me: Interests/what I like**

* Fashion, at least loosely ‚Äì I like to dress well, and have more suits than excuses to wear suits. I‚Äôm a tech nerd who doesn‚Äôt dress like a tech nerd.
* Reading ‚Äì Lots of professional books (technical and team building, currently) and a ton of Science Fiction, but I‚Äôll read anything.
* Games ‚Äì board, card, video ‚Äì I don‚Äôt spend as much time on these as I used to, but I enjoy games and closed systems at least as a social activity. I‚Äôd kind of like to get to a few more board game meetups.
* Hiking ‚Äì I just like moving, generally. I try to keep fit, but don‚Äôt spend hours in a gym or lifting. Seeing Castles, ruins, or just ancient forests and farmers fields always feels like a ‚Äòwin‚Äô for me.
* Economics/Politics/Philosophy/History ‚Äì as long as you don‚Äôt mind disagreeing, I love exploring ideas in this space, especially around ethics and moral philosophy.
* Food ‚Äì I love good restaurants, cooking, and talking about food generally. If I‚Äôm a nerd about one thing, I‚Äôm a food nerd. One day I will walk away from real life and cook pizza for a living.
* Lying in the sun in my underwear ‚Äì not really ‚Äòtanning‚Äô and not really ‚Äòmeditating,‚Äô but just ‚Äòbeing‚Äô with the sun on my skin. Maybe I‚Äôm an exhibitionist just daring my neighbours. Maybe I‚Äôm tempting fate and skin cancer. Maybe I have a vitamin D deficiency. Who knows.
* Lots of other things. Guess you‚Äôll just have to ask.

If any part of this speaks to you at all, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. If you want a starting point, tell me about a piece of media (music, movie, tv, book‚Ä¶.) that just sticks with you in some way that you would recommend to anyone.

But after 30 days of actually applying James Clear's methods from Atomic Habits, I'm a different person.

Here's what happened when I stopped reading about habits and started building them:

* I started stupidly small. Instead of ""I'm gonna work out for an hour every day,"" I committed to one push-up. That's it. Sounds dumb, right? But I actually did it. One turned to five. Then five turned to 10. I now do 20 pushups in a set when it's chest day.
* I made it impossible to fail. Put my workout clothes right next to my bed. Left a water bottle on my nightstand. Put a book on my pillow. When I woke up, healthy stuff was literally in my face. I also stopped buying junk food and soda's. No more fast food deliveries too.
* I piggybacked on stuff I already do. ""After I brush my teeth, I'll do my push-up."" ""After I pour coffee, I'll read one page."" I attached new habits to things I was already doing automatically. Same thing where I'll meditate after making my bed.

What happened week by week:

* Week 1: Doing my one push-up feeling like an idiot. But hey, I did it every day.
* Week 2: Started doing 5 push-ups because one felt too easy. Read 2-3 pages because one wasn't enough.
* Week 3: 15-20 push-ups felt normal. Reading for 10-15 minutes became automatic.
* Week 4: Full 30-minute workouts. Reading 30+ pages daily. It just happened. I realized this what compound growth means.

I stopped thinking of myself as lazy. I became ""someone who works out daily"" and ""someone who reads."" My brain literally rewired itself.

What I learned:

* Small and consistent beats big and sporadic every time. I'd rather do one push-up every day for a year than 100 push-ups once.
* Your environment matters more than your willpower. If you make good choices easier and bad choices harder, you'll naturally do better.
* Missing one day doesn't matter. Missing two days in a row starts a bad pattern.

Biggest mistake I made was tying to change everything at once. I focused on just two habits exercise and reading. That's it.

If you want to try this: just Pick ONE tiny habit. Make it so small it feels almost stupid. Do it for 30 days. Don't worry about results, just show up.

I went from zero exercise and zero books to working out daily and reading 2-3 books a month. Not because I became more disciplined, but because I made it easier.",161,1756729697.0,Habits,10,0.96,False

My first real houseplant was a Calathea and I repotted her really early on in a cheap generic peat-free potting mix. I have her on a pebble tray and used to mist every morning, but started developing fuzz on the top soil. I stopped my daily misting, removed the fuzz and sprinkled with cinammon. She's doing okay, but the soil never seems to dry out, and new leaves are coming in a lil bit crispy. I want to repot her in more suitable soil, but I am scared I'll make it worse as she's still getting along fairly well. I just worry what damage is going on under the soil if it is staying damp for sooo long.

I have also repotted my Monstera in the same soil  mix, although this doesn't seem to have any drainage issues. I have bought specific succulent and cacti soil mix for all my succulent plants, and they are happy and thriving.

I so want to know what I'm doing. Are there any books you would recommend for a newbie like me? Are there any websites out there with tables or lists of plants and preferred soils? Something that is idiot proof, and isn't bombarded with information?

I bought a bag of Sphagnum moss and a bag of perlite a while ago, and saved some coffee grounds, but it's all just sat in the garage going unused at the moment because I'm so scared of doing the wrong thing.

This ancient town, about a 2-hour drive from Â§ßÁêÜ Dali, was described to me as something like a hidden paradise.

When I finally made the trip myself, they weren't exaggerating. Shaxi feels like it's been preserved behind some kind of time barrier. The streets, buildings, and stone pathways all maintain their traditional style, but it's not that weathered, crumbling kind of historic feel you sometimes get. Instead, there's this fresh sense of history, like time decided to slow way down here a few hundred years ago and never quite sped back up.

I looked into it later and learned this is thanks to a restoration project from about 20 years ago. The funding came from Swiss institutions, and the main architect was ÈªÑÂç∞Ê≠¶ Huang Yinwu. His philosophy for heritage restoration was ""maximum preservation, minimum intervention"" - basically respecting local cultural traditions and building techniques rather than just making things look artificially old. You can see this in how buildings like ÂÖ¥ÊïôÂØ∫ Xingjiao Temple, the theater stage, and ÂçóÂØ®Èó® Nanzhai Gate were extensively restored or even rebuilt, but somehow they don't feel out of place at all.

The whole project was slow and restrained. During my few days in Shaxi, I kept hearing locals say one thing: ""We don't want to become another Lijiang.""

There's something about this place that puts you into ""Shaxi time"" - you naturally slow down, get absorbed in whatever you're doing. I found myself putting my phone away and just focusing on eating lunch properly, not thinking about afternoon plans or messages I needed to reply to. Just choosing, chewing, swallowing. After eating, I'd wander down to the river by the ancient town, stand by the water, and just soak in this incredible sense of calm.

Shaxi has attracted quite a few outsiders who've opened businesses here, so in this seemingly isolated little town, you'll find several coffee shops, Western restaurants, bakeries, burger joints, and Japanese restaurants. It caters to that refined middle-class taste, which makes it pretty different from your typical ancient town. Maybe that's unfortunate in some ways, but some people seem to like this blend of preserving tradition while staying connected to modern life.

Even though a popular TV drama ""Meet Yourself"" in 2023 brought more attention to the place, I think it's managed to keep its unique quiet atmosphere. Definitely worth experiencing for yourself if you get the chance.",24,1756729038.0,travelchina,7,0.94,False
