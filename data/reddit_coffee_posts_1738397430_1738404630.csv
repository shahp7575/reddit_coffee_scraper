1if3aog,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1if3aog/vent_i_hate_being_treated_as_a_trauma_dumping/,[Vent] I hate being treated as a trauma dumping ground and backup friend by extroverts,"I have always been an introvert and currently I'm just self-isolating, loving my peace, happy with my slow life. I recently went on a solo trip, I try mostly to be on my own, go on solo walks, avoid socializing in hostels, sit with my laptop etc, but still ended up attracting some extroverts on the trip. Here are two incidents that happened with me on the month-long trip:

I. I met A.
A was a male solo traveller in the hostel, just like me. I was back from a solo walk, he said hi, we talked for a few minutes, he suggested a place for dinner and I said yes. He wasn't creepy at all but kind of a closeted flirt. Being an introvert, I find it hard to say no, and at the dinner itself (first day), when he got to know my future travel plans, he said he will accompany me to the next destination and booked transport for the rest of his journey then and there. I had already booked my cab for the next day and part of me went along with him considering that we could share the expense and I'd save some bucks. I started hating him then and there but couldn't bring myself to say no. Now anyone not in my headspace wouldn't see any reason to hate him, he was just an overfriendly guy. But you know those people who just keep blabbering on and on, despite you putting up all signs to repulse them?  This guy literally tagged along with me for the next 3 days and used to blabber every second of the hour except once when another guy joined us on a ride and he was thankfully silent for that amount of time. I literally have a boring personality and yet I tried my best to put up the most boring part of my self by just murmuring hmmm to all his statements and giving curt, almost rude replies. Bloke poured out his life's sob stories to me, god knows why, and even in the sob stories, he didn't come out as a victim as he was trying to portray himself, he was more of a showoff. One day, he literally started crying at the dinner table over how much his father had done for him. I literally don't understand how people can pour their hearts out to someone you met a couple of days ago, especially someone showing no interest. I was on my phone the whole time and didn't even feel the need to console him (maybe I was being an AH but I was tired of what was happening to me). I could have puked at the amount of cringe that came out of him, and he asked me probably a dozen times everyday how I felt about his company. He started counting down to the hours we had left together on our last day, he insisted on meeting again in each other's cities and made future plans for that, while all I was waiting for was the time I'd be rid of him finally. Poor chap misread his bus timings as he was busy blabbering, and had to leave earlier than planned and I was saved from all the embarassment of the kind of goodbye he was expecting. I was finally free, I moved to my next destination, texted with him a bit till he was done with the expense calculations, I cleared off my dues and ghosted him for my own good. 

I kinda know the villain of the story here may be me, the stupid girl who is afraid to say no, but I gave all the clear hints and signs I could, and tried my best.

II. I met B
I was still travelling solo, but this time with a tour company who takes along people in groups. I met B there. She barely talked with me the whole trip, she even made fun of me once publicly when I made a mistake. I was mostly quiet on this whole tour, barely talking with anyone. She was always hanging out with the other people in our group. I was at peace being alone. But I had a few exchanges with her brother and somehow they pictured me as someone who is just not me. I moved on solo to my next point in the trip after I bade goodbye to this group and this girl B starts texting me whole day about my whereabouts and stuff, even calling me at times, which I found strange for someone I had so less interaction with. She keeps telling me how she has very less female friends, and she wants someone quiet who can listen to her problems all day, someone with whom she can sit silently with a coffee, someone who can ""tolerate"" her and won't have much demands or judgements. She said she loved how I had clicked her pics on the whole trip, and wanted us to be bffs. Idk how extroverts assume that I'm this gullible little girl who will agree to be their trauma dumping ground, coz hey I have enough trauma of my own to handle.

I am being an AH here again, but I'm totally not the poor lil introvert she or her brother assumed me to be. I cut off people, I ghost people (despite having zero friends), and I do all my stuff on my own. I hate how people kinda thing introverts NEED more company or some extrovert to come along and ""open them up to their true self"". No we do not. Ig it's not their fault but I'm also done being their backup friend till someone ""cooler"" comes along.

1if396r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1if396r,[Multiple games] January plats #208-211,"New Year, new list of games to platinum. Since my list is much too long, I decided to add a list of games I've dropped to my monthly update. Please ask if you are curious about my thoughts on those. 

Overall I had a very productive January, and caught up on a lot of the leftover games from last year's list.

Sifu - Going from believing this was impossible to getting the platinum was a great journey. The DLC challenges helped a lot to get good enough for the main game, but then the Dragon challenges made me give up on 100% as I think that level of mastery is beyond me.

Coffee Talk - Quick, relaxing visual novel with a cute story. A good time, and I'll certainly try the sequel as well.

Omori - Excellent JRPG in the style of Earthbound or Undertale, but with a lot more horror and disturbing themes. Great story with clever twists and some funny jokes, although the second story route doesn't add much

Animal Well - This game has great vibes and is excellent up to the first credits. I wish it did a better job of guiding the player after that point though, as I needed a guide for ending #2.

Games I gave up on this month:
Raji: An Ancient Epic
The Outer Worlds
Weird West

That's when I realized I forgot my wallet, and I didn’t really feel like walking the whole way home and back again (10 min), so I just asked the cashier (23.4M, gemini) if he could put it on my tab. He said he’d only risk his job for a 10/10 hottie and I was, at best, a 5/10. Also I have guy cooties (??NB, he/they) which is gross and totally unhot.

This personally offended me, so after spending some time in the bathroom crying and pissing myself a little, I had a lightbulb moment. All I had to do was transition into a woman for a few minutes and then turn back to a guy after my stomach was full!

I nipped over to the hospital next door (~30 sec), injected some hormones into my body, changed my name to Davida, and cut my dick off with a scalpel I found. When I returned to the McDonald’s, the same cashier instantly ejaculated when he saw me. He pulled out a $1.2 million diamond ring and proposed, but I said I rather just have the nuggies.

With some yummy in my tummy, I returned to the hospital to suck all the hormones out and reattach my penis. I decided to keep my name cause it kinda grew on me in the 20 or so minutes I had it. When I left the hospital, the same cashier from earlier was waiting for me, but as soon as he saw me his face fell. He looked taken aback. His face turned pale. He was stunned. His eyes went wide. He dropped his plate. He spat out his coffee.

He said I had tricked him, and he never would have given me free McDonald's Chicken McNuggets® if he knew I was actually a plain Joe and not a hot Jane. He called me an asshole and left in tears and I balled my eyes out. After popping them back into my sockets, I returned home. After some light meditation and unsexy brooding, I’m starting to wonder if unnamed cashier was right. Did I go too far when I transitioned into a woman just for some chicken McNuggets? In my defense, I was really hungry, and the nuggies were delicious, and I will probably do it again next week. AITA?

I got palm jaggery from a store and I made palm jaggery syrup. Mixed it cool with instant coffee and after boiling milk, I mixed the palm jaggery + instant coffee mix with the milk and the milk immediately curdles.

I have tried mixing the syrup+coffee mix slowly onto the milk. I have tried adding more creamy layer to the milk. I have tried mixing instant coffee + milk first and then adding the palm jaggery syrup to the milk+coffee mix. 

Every single time, it curdles.

I am not able to figure out for the love of god how those shops do it (they use filter coffee + palm jaggery syrup - and pour hot boiling milk on top of it).

1if353p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1if353p/27_dreams_part_1_maybe/,27 Dreams part 1 maybe,"To give in a bit of context, i once had a very odd vision of this lady, who looked like a news reporter, blue suit, blue skirt, black heels, and lips, for a head. 

she had claimed to be me, that she is just better than me. that she is everything i would ever want to be.

she’s been in my dreams revolving in my life ever since. 

The dream I want to talk about today is my ""final evening party dream"" 

First of all, before i continue, I will be using false names, and second of all, i will be describing the dream in the most detail i can remember. 


It all started out seeing a modern-looking home, those sleek, rich folk homes that I never would myself considered having, though it was a bit far off in the distance. The lights were on, but no one was home, and there wasn't anything surrounding it everything around it was pitch black. There even was a red luxury car in the driveway, that will be important for another story, however. I remember it panned back to me, though, I'm standing in the darkness; I look stunning. my hair is in its most natural, healthiest stage I've ever seen; it's long and past my shoulders, and I'd never thought I'd see my hair like that again. I'm wearing a red dress that may or may not been silk. it's red with thin straps. I'm even wearing golden jewelry with a cream tint to it. I looked my best, yet worst. What I mean by that is that you can see how successful I was, but you can also see the misery in my eyes. my old friend from middle school, let's call her Sam, popped up behind me, gently grabbed and shook my shoulder. I looked at them, and they had these eyes of sorrow and guilt. 

""what are you going to do now?"" is what she asked me. I looked at her still before turning my head back and looking at the house; the car looked a much brighter red. I looked back at her and said, ""I don't know, what do you think?"" her sadness only grew in her expression. ""how about a party?"" I remember myself glowing a slight purple when I looked at her with amusement.  ""that sounds wonderful."" is what I replied with. She smiled and said, ""Well, what are you waiting for?"" she started walking towards the house. I stayed behind and thought to myself, and I should mention. in these dreams, I have my thoughts, like if dream me is having these thoughts and I'm having my own as I watch what is happening. anywho, I finally walk in myself. the lights are a bright purple, neon even. As I look around, my house is filled with people I once knew, and even faces I've never seen before, yet felt so familiar. I walk around, and some people wave and then go back to chatting, I get a handshake or two with some quick hugs. people are more observed in each other than me. As I walk around, grasping what is going on, a beautiful woman walks up to me. She is slightly taller and has dirty blonde hair, she's wearing a dress somewhat like mine but has those weird shoulders hanging things instead; her dress was made out of a cheaper material but still looked stunning. She stopped me in my tracks and said, ""Hey! You, my gosh, this is such an awesome party. Why are you throwing it?"" I smile widely and shake her hand, proceeding to say, ""Thank you, it's because I'm going to die."" her face shifted from a smile to slight disgust, and she let go of my hand, somewhat even yanked it back to herself. ""ew, don't tell me that."" is what she said before she looked at me with more disgust and walked away with more disgust, I watched her walk away. I had a confused expression on my face; I remember thinking that was weird and or rude. before I even got to consider where else to go, Sam grabbed my hand and pulled me up the stairs, all then I saw was the roof with my old middle school group there. the room looked way different, a vintage wooden house type of different. they told me to lay with them if I would like, I hesitated yet laid down eventually. the sky was mostly blue, though it was cloudy and dark, with the sky suddenly trying to talk about me about how I could change my fate if I wanted to be happy and live a good life, I don't remember exactly what it said because I ended up ignoring it. Plus, those old friends started talking about something life-related, childish, and dumb but life-related. I ended up trying to listen to the sky again, it said something along the lines of choosing myself, but I couldn't understand it all of a sudden. though I knew it was speaking, my brain didn't wanna listen. I eventually look over at the rest of the group and just leave the roof to go back downstairs, now the party is more hectic, and people are drunk and chatting loudly. mostly having fun. for some reason, I even saw Garfield chugging down a Jack Daniels as he walked by me. whatever though. My L-shaped white couch stood with no one on it; people surrounded it, so I decided to sit down on the top of the L-shaped couch, then bam, it went dark. everything was pitch blank around me besides, well, me, the couch, and the coffee table in front of me. then I heard a finger snap, a spotlight shunned down, and saw that lip lady, she was smiling widely and said, ""Long time no see, I have missed seeing you... Are you ready to choose?"" I was confused, of course, and said, ""Choose what?..."" she laughed loudly and said, ""To choose how you die, silly!"" I shifted my expression in annoyance rather than confusion, something in me, the dream me, knew something about this that I didn't. She snapped her fingers quickly and showed me a large brick of cocaine, I shook my head and scoffed no in anger and annoyance. ""okay, that one was never a favorite of yours anyways."" she snapped her fingers again, and a gun, with a silencer, appeared. this time, I looked up at her with only my eyes in an annoyed way. though she had no eyes, I could tell she was looking at me with some type of sinister expression. She giggled and snapped her fingers again, this time, the red luxury car appeared. ""You do often go with this route, is this what you'd like?"" she asked with a mocking-like tone. I could feel my face twitching in rage. She snapped her fingers again to show only all three things together. ""with the path you have been choosing and keep choosing. These are your best candidates, love."" As I got more upset, I tried to get up from the couch, but as I stood, everything was back the way it was. The party was continuing; some of it had died down, and there weren't too many people in the room I was in as beforehand, as I looked around, I got dragged over again and shoved outside. People were chanting and cheering, and I got pushed into the pool, I remember sinking in and falling on something. that something was a floor, a white floor. I get up and look around to see a long white hallway, with an equally long window on each wall showing a pool inside with multiple mini me's, aka, child me. I don't look like what I did during the party, however, but what I looked like at the time. At the time, I was 14. I have had multiple of these types of dreams since I was 13, and they still happen. However, As I looked at these windows, I didn't notice a figure standing next to me until he spoke. He was a black rabbit with a purple Chinese-patterned suit. He looked dapper as hell, I won't lie. Yet he had a more kind energy; he looked at me, and his eyes were pure white. ""Are you ready to ask your questions again?"" I look at him, confused. He felt familiar, but I had never seen him. ever. Well, about that, when I said sure, he said, ""Okay, you have until we reach the door."" I nodded, and we slowly made our way to the other side of the hallway, one window of children me were playing with joy, and the other was aggression. I remember asking some questions about where I was and why I was there. He answered, but I don't remember much. But I do remember he walked even slower at one point to tell me this. ""you always do this, every time. every life. you always ask the questions you won't remember. I am getting tired of it; I need you to move on to the next one."" I tried changing it up and asking about him, but again, I can't remember it. and again, he said, ""You keep doing this."" but by that point, we had made it to the door, and I looked at him and said this. ""Am I really going to die at 27?"" he looked at me, his face had sadness in it, yet determination. ""let's hope not. not this time, at least."" he pushed me out the door, and I woke up in a dead sweat.

let’s go over this 1 by 1. Junseo matched with YouJin on first impressions, right? Not even a discussion, just looking at them staring at him (basically). He went to the date, i have rewatched Junseo’s all paradise dates just to see if I missed something, but it was clear that they were both trying to have fun, had a good time, talked to whatever extent, and next day Youjin was dropped off at a different inferno and Junseo went back to the girls’ one. So after Youjin’s date, Junseo meets her next two days later. In Youjin’s interview, she shares herself she was feeling awkward, so she couldn’t talk which is understandable. But Junseo also said in the coffee date with Sian that he was feeling like she is ignoring him. (after they returned and all got united in the same inferno) 
So campfire night was a pivotal moment. What happened was a misunderstanding. Youjin sat next to him and hardly said anything in the BEGINNING. She said, this sauce goes well with this. We are having drinks after a long time. Junseo agreed and corrected himself saying, oh sorry, i had it yesterday. Youjin mostly talked to Theo, very friendly banters but to Junseo, it might not have felt like that. They are all strangers and they don’t have viewers perspective. So they might okay, she is interested in him more. Finally, Junseo asked Youjin if she wants to go with Theo to paradise, she denied. Then when Junseo left, he came to Minseol and Hyejin, the first thing he said is maybe if I leave, something might happen between them. He wasn’t badmouthing them, he was understanding that he definitely doesn’t have that sort of click with her, but from the friendly banter, he felt, okay let them figure it out. The next morning, girls leave again for Paradise. So another days go by without any communication from Youjin and JS. The clip that is viral where JS is ignoring Youjin is from the next morning’s breakfast table where everyone comes back. JS talks to Minseol and Youjin asks him, is anyone sitting there, he says no and leaves to sit somewhere else. You can go back to the actual footage and check, if he ignored him or simply ended the conversation. I think it’s good manners when you feel like someone is not interested in me, they get the hint and not bother. Most people would assume that JS didn’t want to assert his presence because his personality is very straight forward.

Minseol + Sian timeline

Now, let’s come back to Minseol and JS. The very first time JS picked Minseol, it was between three girls and not all. So he picked her based on that, she also picked him. Till then, Junseo technically didn’t even have a single chat with Sian.
They come back, have their friendly (jS+Ms) chats, in the meantime Sian asks JS for coffee date and since then, if you notice JS has done a lot of small things for her. From scooping rice to giving kimchi, playing by the pools and just sitting together at the table. Not everything airs but in between, there are moments that say they definitely had a friendly vibe. Simply, Junseo and Sian sitting when new girl arrives and sort of ignoring her was one of the activities. Meanwhile, i don’t see any chemistry developing between junseo and minseol. Cause their talks even on 1on1 are very superficial. Some banters max. She is cool (but not everyone can match everyone’s emotional depth/ maturity/ understanding) so he said, he cares for her. But nothing beyond that he promised. Minseol wasn’t promised a paradise date, Junseo asked her do you want to go? Why? She gave her answer why. I am one hundred percent sure after Sian and Junseo’s paradise date, he didn’t feel like he can connect equally with Minseol. She told him before that, please don’t give me your answer, won’t be fun then. So how can he reject her? When she specifically said, don’t tell me your answer? And about rude
Junseo likes casual way of speaking. I think UDT habits. But he just prefers that sort of bro comfort in speaking. He called Minseol brat probably because he has that comfort with him, like an older-younger almost sibling sort of comfort. So he couldn’t have just rejected her right after SHE INSISTED him not to give her a direct answer. So what is not clicking?",3,1738403159.0,Singlesinferno2,1,0.8,False

That was hours ago. I have sinve spent the last two days just trying to reenter the game to atleas leave the room. But if I even get in a queue and then have the time to wait 30 minutes, the loading screen always ends in a timeout error. So theres that.

Safe to say I am farely annoyed but it seems the game is generally in a pretty bad place right now and starting my journey right now was probably the most stupid move i couldve done. But the few minutes I had I liked relly much so I have hope that with future patches, this will be resolved. 

By the way, proposal to CIG: You want to focus on playability? Then do so! The whole year: No new nothing, only bug fixing, loading times, bringing ships up to standard! If you do, what the players want, and make this an actually playable game, you wont need the extra marketing because people will enjoy it and come to you all by yourself and the community will support this.

I underwent two laser vitreolysis treatments, which helped break apart the largest, darkest floaters, but I was still left with around 60-70 of them. For years, I lived behind sunglasses.

Then I decided to try one more thing: fasting. I did a 5-day water fast (only water and coffee), ate within a 1-hour window, then fasted for 2 more days, ate again, fasted for 3 more days—always making sure to eat within just one hour.

Now, from having 60, 70, maybe even 80 floaters (long strings, spiderweb-like structures, dots—everything), I have almost none left.

I can only encourage everyone to try it.

I know Reddit has its fair share of trolls who downvote anything that might genuinely help people, so this post probably won’t be up for long. But if even a few of you see this, try it, and it gives you a new life, I’m happy.

1if2vjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1if2vjo/minimalism_in_furniture_how_less_can_be_more_in/,Minimalism in Furniture: How Less Can Be More in Home Design,"In a world filled with distractions, clutter, and excess, minimalism offers a refreshing approach to home design. This trend focuses on simplicity, functionality, and an appreciation for space, proving that less can indeed be more. Whether you’re furnishing a new home or revamping your space, minimalism helps create an environment that feels airy, calming, and effortlessly stylish.

# The Principles of Minimalist Furniture Design

Minimalism in furniture isn’t just about having fewer items—it’s about choosing quality over quantity. The guiding principles include:

* **Functionality First** – Every piece should serve a purpose, eliminating unnecessary furniture that clutters a space.
* **Clean Lines & Simple Forms** – Modern, sleek designs with minimal ornamentation create a refined look.
* **Neutral Color Palettes** – Whites, beiges, grays, and earthy tones make the space feel open and timeless.
* **High-Quality Materials** – Natural elements such as wood, stone, and metal add depth and sophistication.

# Minimalist Furniture Choices That Elevate Your Space

# 1. Rattan Furniture: Natural Elegance in Simplicity

When designing a minimalist home, [rattan furniture UAE](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) is an excellent choice. Its lightweight yet durable structure complements minimalist aesthetics by adding warmth and texture without overwhelming a space. A rattan armchair, coffee table, or a simple rattan bench can effortlessly blend into a minimalist living room or patio, offering comfort with a natural touch.

# 2. Hanging Chairs: Functional and Stylish Statement Pieces

Minimalism doesn’t mean sacrificing personality. [Hanging chairs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/hanging-chairs) are a fantastic way to introduce both function and design into your home. Suspended from the ceiling or mounted on a stand, they provide a cozy, floating seating option that keeps the floor space uncluttered. Perfect for a reading nook or a peaceful corner, a hanging chair contributes to a minimalist aesthetic while adding a touch of uniqueness.

# 3. Contemporary Furniture: The Essence of Minimalist Design

[Contemporary furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) aligns seamlessly with minimalism due to its sleek lines, neutral tones, and multifunctionality. A streamlined sofa with hidden storage, a modular dining table, or a chic platform bed can redefine your home’s aesthetic while maintaining a clutter-free environment. Opt for designs that emphasize open space and visual lightness to keep your home feeling spacious.

# 4. Essential House Furniture for a Minimalist Home

Minimalist [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) should focus on necessity and elegance. Some key pieces include:

* **A sleek, multifunctional dining table** – Choose a table that can expand when needed but remains compact otherwise.
* **Minimalist storage solutions** – Floating shelves, built-in cabinets, and sleek sideboards keep belongings organized without excess furniture.
* **Low-profile beds** – A platform bed with neutral linens enhances the simplicity of a minimalist bedroom.
* **Statement lighting** – Instead of bulky lamps, go for pendant lighting with clean geometric shapes.

# Why Minimalism Works for Any Home

Minimalist design isn’t just about aesthetics—it enhances functionality and improves well-being. By reducing clutter, a minimalist home feels more peaceful, organized, and stress-free. Additionally, investing in high-quality, timeless pieces means your furniture lasts longer, making minimalism a sustainable and cost-effective choice.

Whether you're drawn to rattan furniture in the UAE, considering hanging chairs for a cozy retreat, or seeking contemporary furniture to redefine your space, adopting minimalism will transform your home into a haven of simplicity and style.

# Final Thoughts

Minimalism proves that less is more when it comes to home design. By selecting functional, stylish, and timeless house furniture, you can create a space that feels open, welcoming, and effortlessly elegant. Start your minimalist journey today and experience the beauty of simplicity!

Available in 2 models, 4 colors. 8 charming mobile standing desks at your service!

From Violet Chen: It all started during a cold Boston winter...

**Reflection No. 1: Perfect Light Makes the Perfect Desk**

Sunlight is my most precious resource for staying motivated. I found myself chasing the light around the house, abandoning my expensive electric standing desk for a sunny spot on the couch or kitchen. Of course, those impromptu setups came at a cost—neck pain and back pain. Why wasn’t I using the fancy standing desk I’d invested in? Simple: it was stuck in a dim corner of the house, for some reason I don't have an electric socket where I would have loved to place this desk.

**Reflection No. 2: Electric Standing Desks—Adjust Twice, Then Forget**

When I thought about my relationship with my standing desk, I realized I only adjusted it twice a day—once to stand, and once to sit. I stand as long as I can till I have to sit down. That’s it.

**The Quest for the Perfect Desk for the light-chasers and mobile creative thinkers.**

**1. Sturdiness:** The desk needed to be mobile yet rock-solid. We landed on a 19"" x 28"" desktop, spacious enough for a laptop and monitor, with a weight capacity of 110 lbs—more than enough for a MacBook Pro and a 27"" monitor (usually below 15lbs). After relentless testing, we’re proud of how stable it feels.

**2. Versatility:** Since I often work (and eat) by my laptop, we chose a powder-coated finish for the desktop. It’s durable enough to handle hot plates, coffee spills, and more. Plus, it’s environmentally friendly. Now, the ANYDESK can go anywhere—your kitchen, bathroom, even outdoors.

**3. Style:** Design is at the heart of everything we do at TopJob. We rounded all the edges to make the desk feel inviting—a piece of furniture that blends seamlessly into your home.

**4. Space-savvy:** Owning a desk is a serious commitment—I already regret my giant standing desk. That’s why both ANYDESK have low-profile legs, so they can slide effortlessly under the couch or bed, making it the perfect couch-side table. The ANYDESK Fold tilts 90 degrees to rest flat against a wall. In short, this desk knows how to ""disappear"" in two clever ways, giving us back the precious space when we need it most.

**The L-Shape Revelation.** We stumbled upon an unexpected bonus: two ANYDESKs can combine into a larger, L-shaped configuration for more serious work sessions. My husband and I each have one, but when big projects come along, we join them to create the ultimate collaborative workspace.

I know it's not long. Recently, I went to the doctor after he noticed something concerning about a part of my body. It turned out I have a medical condition that can be treated with surgery. What’s bothering me is that I’m disappointed in him. We’re both in a city we’re not familiar with, and he didn’t even think to offer to come with me to the appointment. I didn’t actually want him to go because I knew it would sacrifice his sleep, waiting for hours at the doctor’s office. What upset me was the lack of initiative or support. I didn’t ask him to come—I just wanted to see if he would offer, but he didn’t. I’m not upset that he didn’t physically wait with me, but the lack of emotional support is what bothers me. I’m actually grateful that my coworker, who’s sweet, came with me because she knew I’d get lost and asked why my boyfriend didn’t come. Over the past few days, I’ve been going back and forth to the hospital, sacrificing sleep, then going to work with only 2-3 hours of rest. He didn’t check in on me once. I’m always the one updating him, and if I don’t message first, he won’t reach out. When I got home, he even had the audacity to ask me to make him coffee while he slept all day. It made me feel like he didn’t care or wasn’t there for me. I’m not expecting him to visit when I eventually need surgery, but I just want to feel like he’s supportive and concerned.",1,1738400604.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

###### *December 15th, 1973 -- Belgrade*

---

## Hotel Moskva

The cold winter had begun to set in.

With temperatures as low as -10, the people of Belgrade were certainly getting ready for the winter ahead. Many stores around the city had just begun offering special sales before the 31st, and restaurants had just started working on their New Year's specials. 

Leb i Sol started their tour through Yugoslavia, and Smak just had their first performance after a month-long hiatus—all was well, in a more non-important sense.

Politically, turbulent times were ahead. Since the repeated arrest of Comrade Djilas, circles closely associated with the more moderate faction within the Party became far more restrained and tactical in how they act; biding their time and searching for allies, rather than acting prematurely for a cause that may be sabotaged from the start. When discussing Yugoslav politics, one must understand that three main actors are less powerful than the Marshal but can whisper into his ear: the Army, the Central Committee, and the Republican governments. 

Džemil Šarac, a 52-year-old Yugoslav People’s Army officer, sat alone in the café of the famous Hotel Moskva, slowly sipping on a hot coffee and enjoying a portion of Šampita. The relative bustle of the Hotel did dissipate with the rumbling of an engine from the outside. A tall, assertive figure entered the hotel, marched towards Šarac and handed him a crumpled-up note - the officer opened it.

> *” Mr. Šarac, he’s here - nod if you are sure.”*

Šarac would nod. 

As the tall figure left the building, two men entered; one was visibility shorter than the previous, but still had an imposing attitude and an impeccable posture. The other man appeared distraught as if he had been running for hours out of fear. His eyes were sunk, and his cheekbones were far more visible when compared to any man who had been eating properly. As they moved closer and closer to the table, Šarac would motion for the two men to sit, soon after which he would motion for the waiter.

> “Two portions of chicken breasts, and some salad, please. And for these gentlemen, two glasses of water, and a glass of whiskey for me.”

> “Right away, sir.”

The waiter would leave the men.

> “So, Comrade Djilas - how have our friends from UDBA been treating you? I hope Dimitrievski has not been too harsh -”

> “What do you want, Šarac? Have learned from my mistakes? Yes. Do I ask for forgiveness? Yes. Do I want to join the Party? Only if it’s the only way to get my freedom -”

> “Slow your roll. You’re not with UDBA anymore, the Army is taking over - you’ll be assigned as a ‘Special Consultant to the Party Committee for the YPA - this is your only ticket out, on the condition that you give me your unwavering loyalty.”

> “Loyalty? When have I not been loyal to the Army, if anything, the Army has more balls than the entire Party ever will. What do you…*want* me to do?”

> “For now, nothing - just promise me that you’ll stay out of trouble.”

The bustle would return once more. With the food being served, the three men would continue their conversation. Discussing matters perhaps best saved for later.",4,1738400557.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

1if2bsb,https://i.redd.it/wdfabxawrhge1.png,"Saturday, February 01, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Resilience"" - Rising Stronger: Embracing the Power Within • [Click to Expand]","## Life's Challenges vs. Your Resilience: Who Wins?



Life throws curveballs. Sometimes they come in the form of financial struggles, heartbreak, failure, or even a random Tuesday that feels like it’s out to get you. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, like the world is conspiring to keep you down. But here’s the thing: “Life is tough, but I am tougher” is not just a motivational quote to slap on a coffee mug. It’s a mindset—a way of reclaiming your power in the face of adversity.  

### **Acknowledging Life’s Toughness**  
Let’s not sugarcoat it: life is hard. From the moment we’re born, we’re thrust into a world that demands effort, resilience, and a level of patience we didn’t sign up for. For me, it hit hardest in college. Picture this: a dorm room lit by a single flickering bulb, a stack of textbooks taller than my desk, and a ramen diet that could make a nutritionist cry. It was during finals week, after pulling my third all-nighter in a row, that I hit my breaking point. I remember thinking, “Why does life have to be so relentless?”  

This feeling isn’t unique to me. We all face moments where the sheer weight of existence feels like too much. For some, it’s a health crisis; for others, it’s losing a job or navigating relationships. Life’s toughness is universal. The trick, though, isn’t in dodging the punches—it’s in learning to roll with them and punch back harder.  

### **The Origin of Inner Toughness**  
If life’s toughness is inevitable, where does the toughness within us come from? It starts with perspective. Every challenge is an opportunity in disguise. That sounds cliché, but think about it: how many times have you gone through something awful, only to come out stronger or wiser?  

When I lost my first job, it felt like the world had ended. I had bills to pay, a bruised ego, and no clear path forward. But that forced me to pivot and explore freelancing—a move that eventually led to a career I love. My resilience wasn’t born out of some innate superpower; it grew because life gave me no other choice.  

The same applies to you. Toughness isn’t a trait you’re born with; it’s a skill you cultivate. It’s forged in the fire of experience, shaped by the scars you carry, and refined every time you choose to keep going.  

### **Small Wins Build Big Resilience**  
One thing people often overlook is the importance of small victories. When life feels overwhelming, focusing on tiny, manageable goals can be a game-changer. During my rough college years, I started celebrating the little things: finishing a paper, cooking an actual meal, or even just making it through the day.  

These small wins became stepping stones. They didn’t erase the bigger problems, but they gave me the momentum to tackle them. Every time I accomplished something, no matter how minor, it was like a little voice inside me whispered, “See? You’ve got this.”  

If you’re in a tough spot right now, ask yourself: what’s one small thing I can do today to make tomorrow a bit easier? It doesn’t have to be monumental. Sometimes just showing up is enough.  

### **The Role of Community**  
Here’s another truth: you don’t have to go it alone. Being tough doesn’t mean being isolated. In fact, one of the toughest things you can do is admit you need help.  

After I graduated and faced a period of unemployment, I leaned on friends and family. It wasn’t easy—I hated the idea of being a burden—but their support reminded me that resilience isn’t just an individual trait. It’s something we build together.  

So, don’t be afraid to reach out. Whether it’s a friend, a mentor, or even a therapist, having someone in your corner can make all the difference. Toughness is about knowing when to stand alone and when to let others hold you up.  

### **Reframing Failure as Fuel**  
One of the biggest hurdles to toughness is the fear of failure. Society loves to glorify success, but it often glosses over the messy, painful process that leads there. The truth? Failure is not the opposite of success; it’s a part of it.  

Take Thomas Edison, who famously said, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” That’s resilience in action. Each misstep teaches you something valuable—if you’re willing to learn from it.  

I once bombed a presentation at work so badly that my boss had to step in and finish it. I was mortified, but instead of wallowing, I asked for feedback, practiced like crazy, and nailed the next one. That experience didn’t just make me better at presenting; it made me tougher overall.  

The key is to see failure as a stepping stone, not a dead end. Every setback is a setup for a comeback.  

### **Mindset Matters**  
At the heart of resilience is mindset. How you frame your experiences shapes how you respond to them. If you see challenges as insurmountable, they will be. But if you view them as temporary hurdles, you’ll find a way to clear them.  

One practice that’s helped me is gratitude. It sounds counterintuitive—why focus on what’s good when everything feels bad? But gratitude shifts your perspective. It reminds you that even in the darkest times, there’s light to be found.  

During one particularly tough year, I started keeping a gratitude journal. Each night, I’d write down three things I was thankful for. Some days it was big stuff—like landing a new client. Other days, it was as simple as “I had a really good cup of coffee.” Over time, this habit rewired my brain to focus on the positive, making me more resilient in the face of challenges.  

### **The Bigger Picture**  
When life gets tough, it’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. We get so caught up in the day-to-day grind that we forget why we’re grinding in the first place.  

What are you working toward? What’s your purpose? For me, it’s making a difference through my work and being there for the people I care about. Knowing my “why” gives me the strength to push through tough times.  

Take a moment to reflect on your own purpose. What drives you? When you’re clear on that, life’s challenges feel less like obstacles and more like detours on the road to something greater.  

### **The Takeaway**  
“Life is tough, but I am tougher” isn’t about denying the struggles we face. It’s about acknowledging them and choosing to rise anyway. It’s about embracing failure, leaning on others, celebrating small wins, and keeping your eyes on the bigger picture.  

So, the next time life feels overwhelming, remind yourself of this: you’ve faced tough times before, and you’ve made it through. You’re still here, still standing, still fighting. Life may be tough, but you? You’re tougher.

I haven’t taken a pregnancy test yet since I’m not sure if it would be able to detect it this early. Based on my research, I should wait at least 3 days after my expected period for a confirmed result to avoid a false negative.  

So, while waiting for my next period and before taking a pregnancy test for confirmation—whether I turn out to be positive or negative—I’m considering consuming alcohol, coffee, doing extreme workouts (fatigue), and taking naproxen (not yet sure bout this). Would this be dangerous?  

Additional: If I am confirmed to be pregnant, I plan to take MA and purchase pills from trusted sources (WoW). For now, I just want to do something to prevent this 'pregnancy.'

1if29xm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1if29xm,Game Review 02 - Super Slime ✅,"Super Slime, 7d, 900SB.

Completed in 3 days.

➡️ Gameplay: Snake-like. Prioritize coins for time upgrades, some for experience. Use remaining coins to upgrade size at least once, as it's more expensive to level up. Stages grouped in difficulty (1-5 easier, 6-10 harder, etc.). Watch videos for size/exp boosts at x6-x0 stages.

➡️ Mechanics: Consume blocks/items based on current size. Fill the bar to defeat the boss. Use video extensions (7-12 seconds) for better one-shot boss attempts. Always claim 3x rewards (via video) after boss battles.

➡️ Skins: Customize your slime's appearance. Each skin has different base stats, upgradable for various bonuses (exp, time, etc.). While upgrading isn't essential for SB completion, it's recommended for easier gameplay.

➡️ Shop: Offers various packages, but none are particularly useful or necessary, as SB reimbursement is unlikely. The 2000 coins per video (3x daily) are less efficient than size upgrades in the main game.

➡️ Other Features: Various speedups, bonuses, and ways to gain coins/buffs. Focus on the core three stats in the main game screen.

➡️ Arena: A multiplayer mode where you attack other players. Easy to achieve rank 1, but rewards are minimal, making it unnecessary for SB completion.

➡️ Difficulty: Post-stage 20, completing in one go becomes challenging. The game can get repetitive.

➡️ Monetization: No spending required for SB completion. 900 SB earned in 3 days.

➡️ Profit Analysis: 900 SB for 3 days of casual play. Free coffee or burger money!

Conclusion: Super Slime is interesting initially but repetitive. Easy game, easy SB. Recommended.

1if27ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1if27ts/husband_seems_to_clock_off_when_i_am_home/,Husband seems to “clock off” when I am home,"My (28f) husband (32m) and I have been together for 10 years. We have 2 children (5 and 3 years old)

Early years of our relationship were rocky, he was emotionally abusive and had major anger issues. I grew up with an abusive step dad, so 19 year old me jumped at the opportunity to move 2 hours away to where he lived. I didn’t know what I wanted, or what I would and wouldn’t stand for. 
In hindsight I knew I was in an abusive relationship, but because he never physically hurt me I never thought it was enough reason to leave, young and naive, I guess.

Fast forward 5 years and our son is born, I grew some balls and wasn’t afraid anymore. I gave him an ultimatum, either he stops being an abusive partner or I’m leaving, he sorted his anger out and things did get better. When our son was a few months old, covid hit. I got made redundant, he quit his job (government payments were equal to his pay, so he took a year off to “be with me and bub”) 
During our son’s first year of life, he did nothing to help. I mean, not a single nappy change, bed time, meal and barely played with him. 
I spent countless nights rocking our son to sleep for 40 + minutes feeling completely deflated, I would get him down and sit in his room and cry for hours.

As our son got older, things got easier - or just more manageable to do it on my own I guess. 2 years later we had our daughter, I told him he had to step mum, and he did.. a little bit. The bar was already so low, so although he was helping with a few things it was still the bare minimum, if that. But I had to be grateful and was never allowed to ask for more. 

I can’t get over everything that happened in the past, 
- The nights I spent crying in our sons room, 
- The nights I spent sitting in bed while he screamed at me at the top of his lungs, 
- The time I tried to leave and he smashed my phone and the windscreen of my car, the time I was pregnant and he screamed abuse at me in a fit of rage in the middle of the road because HIS car broke down 
- The time he forced me in the car and told me he was driving me to the hospital to get an abortion as I was crying my eyes out in the passenger seat - for him to just drive past it and go home.
- The times he would scream at me for not putting the kettle back in the right spot, even though I woke up at 4am to make him a coffee every morning when I didn’t start work until 8am. 
- The time he forced me to choose either him or my best friend, who hasn’t been in my life for years and now has kids of her own and it breaks my heart into a million pieces that I don’t know her anymore, worse than a break up.
- The countless times he would threaten to come to my work and drag me out of there if I didn’t come home early to “sort out problems out”
- The time I didn’t go through the orange light and decided to stop, he screamed abuse at me for the whole 20 minute drive and when we got to the beach with our friends he was still yelling and swearing at me, wouldn’t help me with the pram - another guy came over to help and he said “don’t help her, let her struggle”
I could go on…

But years after all this ended I still held/do hold so much resentment. He claims it was “never that bad” and by him saying that really makes me realise he will never get it, and never hold himself accountable for everything he has done because he says “I have forgotten the good times”

I admit, his anger and short fuse has gotten better - he has not gone into these flip outs for quite a few years as he knows I won’t tolerate it anymore.

I always thought the solution to falling back in love was just to let go of the resentment and move forward, which I’ve been trying so hard to do but it doesn’t work. Now I realise although the anger and outbursts have gone, there’s still so many flaws in our relationship.

His negative qualities 
- Lack of empathy
- Lack of emotional intelligence 
- Defensiveness
- Selfishness 

I’m beginning to think I could nag and have open communications until the cows come home but nothing will truly change. I cant force him to become someone he is not.

Our current situation/my biggest issue is that when I’m home, he clocks off.

I work 7:00am - 4:00pm (42.5 hours a week)
He works 5:00am - 1:00pm, finishes at 11:00am on Fridays (37.5 hours a week)

My day
Wake up, get ready, get kids ready, drop one at  kinder and one at school.
Work 9 hours
Pick one up from kinder, come home, give kids snacks, cook dinner, unpack school bag, eat dinner, take kids for a walk/bike ride, give baths, do bed time for both, do dishes/clean the kitchen, pack school lunch and bags/clothes for next morning, go to bed.
Most days I get home from work, sit down for 10 minutes to eat dinner and don’t get to “sit/clock off” until they’re in bed and the kitchen is clean, and by then it’s too late for me to relax as I need to be up at 5:30am the next day and need sleep.

His day
Wakes up at 4:00am, gets himself ready, goes to work for 8 hours.
Gets home at 1:30pm, tidy up the lounge room, throw on a load of washing (usually left for me to deal with that night), relaxes/goes to a mates, picks up our son from school at 3:00pm, they come home and play Xbox together/hang out, sit on the couch watching TikTok’s or on Facebook, eats dinner, falls asleep on the couch.

Every time I bring up the fact I need more help I am met with either “oh I guess I don’t do x y z” or “we are back to this yeah, it’s bullshit you say I don’t do anything” or “I’d like to see you wake up at 4am and not fall asleep on the couch”

If we are both sitting on the couch and either of the kids say they need something, he doesn’t bat an eyelid - it’s like he isn’t even here.

I am very tempted to buy the “fair play” book and cards, but I know he will see it as an attack and get defensive or say its such a joke we have to resort to this - I know him too well. But maybe it will make him see how much I actually do.

He also didn’t know how to log into the banking app until a year ago. He wouldn’t know how to pay rent, bills or anything. Has no knowledge of our weekly budget. 

If I sacrifice cleaning/doing the dishes to put my feet up on the couch he will start cleaning and make comments about how I’m “addicted to my tv show” or something like that.

It’s impossible for him to tidy the lounge without making a comment about how my shoes are always on the floor or that the kids are so messy. Like he has the nerve to make comments when he does below the bare minimum for our family.

He has no issue in making me feel like shit over trivial things. I’m a very empathic person and he is the opposite. I am very relaxed and care free I have the attitude of if it can’t be changed then so be it. I just want peace, he on the other hand gets angry and emotional over dumb things, stresses out too much and doesn’t care who he hurts as long as he is okay. 

I also work a half day every 3rd Saturday. I earn almost double his weekly pay, and when I do a Saturday I earn exactly double what he gets for a week.

Logically I know I should leave, I know a weight would be lifted, I would be lonely but I wouldn’t be trapped.

I feel trapped, I can’t stand the thought of him not having us in his life and being alone - as I don’t know how he would cope mentally and financially. I don’t want to break up a family. In the back of my mind I’m worried he would get violent, even though I know he has never hurt me, I’ve seen him in a fit of rage many times before. It’s scary.
He is so emotionally unintelligent that it’s impossible to reason with him and have a mature conversation, it’s exhausting and feels impossible to leave him due to that. The guilt of having a broken home and our kids growing up without their father there.

It almost feels easier to just stay put, keep doing what I’m doing. I’m not happy, I don’t love him, if he were to leave me for someone else today I would be relieved more than anything. He thinks this is love and how a relationship is meant to be, but I know it’s not. He keeps telling me I’m trying to make him this perfect man and be perfect people but the world isn’t like that, couples fight, it’s just how it is. Which I do not believe, I believe there are people out there like me that have emotionally grown and just want peace, communication and laughter. 

I am angry at myself for getting to this spot, completely stuck. I find myself wishing he would leave me so I didn’t have to be the one to do it.

I read once heard a saying “living in a tolerable state of permanent unhappiness” and that’s never left me, because that’s what I’m doing. I bury my head in the sand and try not to think about it to avoid having to make the hard decisions.

I just wish he would help me and show some understanding. I think I need to buy the fair play game and cards, show him how much I do and if he still can’t see it or agree to step up, then I know my answer.

I don’t know the point of this post. I can’t afford a therapist, so here I am.. writing it all down. This was probably so messy to read, if you got this far, I want to say thank you. It is kind of refreshing putting this all out there and get it off my chest. 

I don’t know anyone who’s been in my position, no one gets it ☹️

That’s where I come in. I am fostering her for two months, probably adopting her. I’ve had her for three weeks now and the new allergy food is working.

She is very darty. She is not aggressive. At first she let me cuddle her if I get the chance and she will purr and enjoy it, then she will act like I’m a home invader.

She was slowly getting more comfortable. I noticed her exploring my home more (small tiny tiny house, I live in Hawaii, she has no desire to go outside). And then enjoying my company more.

At two weeks I took her to an appointment at the humane society for her skin. She had such a sad meow in her crate the whole way there and it was awful. Once her appointment ended and I took her back, she slept so peacefully in her crate on our way home.

She started getting more comfortable with me and will come to me on the couch to cuddle. But if I get up to pee and come back, she will sprint off the couch.

Now she’s very hot and cold. For example, I’ll wake up in the morning and she will be on the couch. She will watch me carefully. I will lightly sit on the couch and she will sprint away. When I get up to get coffee, she will immediately jump on the couch and lay down. Then I come to the couch and she runs. The equivalent happens in the evenings.

Yesterday we had a full day of cuddling and her being more vocal. Today, it’s basically her avoiding me.

What should I do to make her comfy? Ignore her? If I manage to grab her (this is 1-2 times) she will lay with me and get so comfy, so I don’t known what to do. Run after her and remind her she enjoys being with me or avoiding her to make her more comfy?",1,1738399413.0,CatAdvice,2,1.0,False

So myself (f23) and my partner (m25) have two children under 2 (yes I live on coffee and my current Roman Empire it ends with us SCANDAL). We have been together for 4 years and have a really amazing life together except the in laws (on both sides) the names and problems with each listed below:

My mother: quite overbearing single mother ""I don't need no man"" type woman tbh (but she does help if I need and I'm grateful)

My father: an absolute crackpot, who thinks we derive from a type of alien ? (Yeah we don't talk to him) 

My fil: A man who prides himself on his only son (he helps finances while I'm studying which I'm very grateful for) however took a while to learn boundaries when It comes to the kids.

Mil: I've never actually met her in person (as she was looking after a family member overseas when my partner and I met but is trying to now move to be closer to us)has made some rude comments about my eldest child's development. And I fear may not know any boundaries if she comes to live with us.

Now on to why I made this post, I received a message from mil today about my daughter (f2) development, I'll call my daughter penny for the sake of the post. Now penny has been taken to a specialist and they have stated although we have been very thorough with teaching penny words and phonics etc she still is yet to pronounce words properly,but understands everything we say and is otherwise developing well. WELL my mil took it upon herself to send me a long worded NOVEL about how I as a parent have not been meeting pennys emotional needs, and now that she's a big sister she feels forgotten. 

This is of course wrong as she loves her brother I'll call Sam (m3months and chunky!) and I have taken steps to ensure she connected and is connected well with him, what I have done:

- continued to tandem feed both babies so she doesn't feel like she's missing out (they hold hands while feeding so cute) 
- we co sleep ( from my partner's culture) she still sleeps safely behind me next to dad and I hold Sam in a safe c curl position (google if confused) and she snuggles me 
- when Sam was first born we decided to use the Pavlov effect on penny and rewarded her with chocolate to associate her younger brother with something positive (seen on TikTok don't judge lol)
- I still make mother daughter time where she helps me cook food or we dance to her shows, colour etc and we are just starting extra circulars this year.

So what she said confused me, this is the message I copied below (name changed):

Mil:It appears that penny is experiencing some emotional challenges related to her relationship with her parents and her own sense of identity. She may feel overwhelmed by the expectations placed upon her to mature quickly, mainly since her family's focus has shifted toward managing household responsibilities since the arrival of her younger brother.

Penny, who is only two years old, seems to express her frustration through withdrawal, potentially feeling marginalized since her brother's birth.  Her comfort zone has gone since she sleeps beside her parent's queen-sized bed.  There may also be a perception that she is being blamed for her behaviour. This situation could be contributing to her reluctance to communicate verbally.

It is essential to recognize that penny is both sensitive and intelligent.  She has a good sense of observation. Therefore, limiting her television time to foster more interactive and supportive developmental experiences may be beneficial.

See why I'm confused? As we don't force our daughter to grow up and she is still my little baby girl, and the only reason she was stating about the tv situation was because I've sent photos of penny where she happened to be to close to the tv (we are working on this). She also loves to help change her brother diaper (not well but the thought counts) and help give a bottle to him (supervised).

What really tipped my post partum RAGE OVER THE EDGE WAS WHEN SHE SENT ME A DAMN PHONICS YOUTUBE VIDEO LINK AND STATED: 

Mil: For your reference.  Maybe try to teach the phonics to kids. 

So am I crazy to cancel all plans of her potentially moving in with us as she doesn't seem to understand boundaries and she's LITERALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD !! what would happen if she lived with us ? So would I be TA if I don't want her two or even one cent of opinion in my children's lives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking a trip to the stunning Albanian Riviera? Make sure to stop in Vlora, a city bursting with history and beauty. Nestled between the rugged mountains and the sparkling Adriatic Sea, Vlora has played a significant role in both Albania's past and its vibrant present. Let's embark on an intriguing journey through time as we explore the rich history of Vlora.

Vlora’s history dates back to ancient times. It was originally established as the Greek colony of Aulon around the 6th century BC. This settlement flourished due to its strategic location and natural harbor. As you stroll through Vlora, you can feel the echoes of the past; the cobblestone streets carry stories from centuries ago. The blend of cultures here is particularly fascinating, showcasing influences from Greek, Roman, and Ottoman eras. You’ll see remnants of ancient structures alongside more modern designs, making each corner of the city a piece of history.

One of the most significant historical events in Vlora’s timeline occurred in 1912. It was here that Ismail Qemali declared Albania’s independence. The National Flag was raised, symbolizing hope and unity for the Albanian people. A visit to the Independence Monument is a must. This impressive structure stands proudly, celebrating the spirit of freedom that continues to inspire generations. Standing in the square, you can envision the fervor and passion that filled this iconic moment in history.

But the stories don’t end there. Vlora was also a vital harbor during the World Wars, serving as an entry point for many military operations. The city has undergone various transformations, and remnants of this turbulent past can still be seen. As a visitor, you can explore several museums that house artifacts and exhibits detailing Vlora’s role during these critical periods.

The historical richness is not just confined to the buildings and monuments; it’s present in the local culture too. The people of Vlora pride themselves on their heritage, and you can experience this warmth and hospitality firsthand. Locals often share stories of their ancestors, passed down through generations, allowing visitors a glimpse into the deep-rooted traditions of this unique community.

If you're looking to delve deeper into the past, consider visiting the **Muradie Mosque**, built in the 16th century. This mosque stands as a testament to Ottoman architecture, with intricate details that capture the eye. You might also want to wander around the old town and explore its charming streets, where you can find quaint cafes and local shops. Each corner offers a new story waiting to be discovered.

- **Historical Sites to Visit:**
- Independence Monument
- Muradie Mosque
- Vlora Archaeological Museum
- Castle of Kaninë

For those who seek adventure mixed with history, take a trip to the **Castle of Kaninë**. This ancient ruin overlooks the lovely coastline and gives a stunning view of the surrounding landscape. Its walls tell tales of battles fought and defenders who stood guard, a reminder of the city’s strategic importance.

The Truth Revealed!,"Ever wondered if switching to an electric toothbrush can give you a brighter, whiter smile? You're not alone! Many people believe that electric toothbrushes can whiten teeth, but is that really true? Let's break it down!

# Do Electric Toothbrushes Actually Whiten Teeth?

The short answer: Yes… but with limitations.

Electric toothbrushes are designed to remove more plaque and surface stains than manual brushes, thanks to their high-speed vibrations or oscillations. However, they won't change the natural color of your teeth or remove deep-set stains like professional whitening treatments.

# How Electric Toothbrushes Help with Whiter Teeth:

*  Better Plaque Removal – They remove more plaque and bacteria, preventing yellowing.
* Breaks Down Surface Stains – The high-speed brushing action helps remove coffee, tea, and wine stains more effectively.
*  Encourages Longer & More Effective Brushing – Built-in timers ensure you brush for the dentist-recommended 2 minutes.

But if you have intrinsic stains (inside the enamel), you'll need whitening toothpaste, strips, or professional treatments for a truly whiter smile.

**Electric Toothbrush vs. Manual: Which is Better for Whitening?**

Studies show that electric toothbrushes remove up to 21% more plaque than manual ones, which helps keep your teeth looking brighter. Some models even have whitening brush heads designed to polish away stains more efficiently.

**Best Electric Toothbrush Features for Whitening:**

*  Sonic or Oscillating Motion – More powerful stain removal
* Whitening Mode – Designed for stain lifting
*  Soft Bristles – Prevents enamel damage
*  Pressure Sensor – Ensures you don’t brush too hard

**How to Maximize Whitening with an Electric Toothbrush**

* Use Whitening Toothpaste – Look for ingredients like hydrogen peroxide or baking soda.
*  Brush After Stain-Causing Foods – Coffee, red wine, and berries can stain your teeth.
*  Floss Daily – Keeps plaque from building up between teeth.
*  Try a Whitening Mouthwash – Helps break down stains over time.
*  Professional Whitening for Deeper Stains – If you want dramatic results, consider dentist-approved treatments.

 **Can Electric Toothbrushes Whiten Teeth?**

* They help remove surface stains and prevent yellowing.
*  They won’t change the natural color of your teeth.

If you're looking for a brighter smile, an electric toothbrush is a great tool—but for true whitening, you’ll need to combine it with other whitening methods!",1,1738398406.0,ElectricTeethbrush,0,1.0,False

Very company PR team gonna give me downvotes 🐽. But i don't care I am not gonna delete this post myself give me your all hate 🫴 come baby lol.

We don't need to review everything scrubbing cream at all 🙅‍♀️ . 
They are waste your money 💸 and best products for company selling its easy peasy for them to make money with this 💰🤑 . ( It's ouch to hear )

My hate for this specific product is because it doesn't do anything for you instead create more products 
You want me to count on problems / cons 

1. If it's have walnut or coffee or plastic pieces then good luck your bathroom cleaning 🧹 journey too. 

a. Coffee scrub came from coffee selling store they use the coffee then repack them with cream on it and sells you. You basically getting nothing from that coffee ☕ scrubb even if coffee have any benefits applying topically.

b. Walnut you can create same small tiny balls in machine nah nah i don't believe in that piece you can get same size balls. 

c. Plastic balls bro or sis come on we don't need plastic balls go down to sink then fish and plants absorbing them then we consume them back we don't need this circle ⭕ in our life 🧬 

2. Suger scrubs i maybe 🤔 maybe 🤔🧐 wrong about it but i believe I have read it many times sweet is the sweetest place for bacteria to grow 😍 🦠 . I know you washing that of but still some residue always left behind so + people use this on shaving days so 😭 sweet is not nice for shaving cuts ( if you get by chance 🛐 i pray 🙏 you don't get cuts ). Sweet increase inflammation so thing about it guys 

3. Salt scrub is interesting 🤔 🤔 i wonder some one have wound then it's gonna be pain. 

Scrubby creams have no place to be in your routine.

Even you get to exfoliate you still get uneven exfoliating on most of body parts + you gonna finish the products even before you really realise.

Sheet mask and scrubbing creams are waste it's always be for your money 👛 , your body🏃‍♀️ , your health ❤️‍🩹, your mental health 🧠 and environment ♻️.

The best options 
Just use a luffa or any wash clothes. You want me to believe you don't have 2 mins to put that luffa front of sun 🤦‍♀️ and disinfectant products 

Chemical exfoliating also nice and daily just moisturizing your body with regular moisturizer without active ingredients also works real real real okay. 

Nobody ass have pay me for anything but it's annoying to see all those junks on shopping mall shelf or  tv laptop mobile 🖥️💻📱

Watch dr dray video on exfoliating - https://youtu.be/vPWoQ5y4qS4?si=fZfOrAshtA6YJs5m

I was watching a sudden dove exfoliating scrub ads come so that's what made to do post. 

I can't take it anymore someone give a option to block those ads specifically.

before we ""broke up"", literally a day before, she showed me that she loved me. she is a really shy person but still went ahead and hugged me thight, initiated cuddles and kissed me, so i thought she loved me. also, a few weeks before this, a friend of hers told me that she told her that im ""genuinely the sweetest person she ever met"", that i ""have no red flags"" and that she loves me.

after that, she started ignoring me for 3 days, i got scared that she'll never speak to me ever again, i felt abandoned. when she eventually texted me back, she told me she isn't ready for a relationship, i got hurt, but i didn't try to change her mind, i just told her that i was upset and that i felt like i was being used by her to get over her ex and i wanna move on with my life since that hurt me deeply, she said to take care of myself. after a few days, i text her, telling her that i thought about it and want to try and fix things, she said that she doesn't know if that's possible, so we reached an agreement that we can still be friends since we care about each other but we should take a break from dating.

after less than 2 weeks, while still following each other on instagram and being in each others close friends lists, she posted her boyfriend. well, it felt like my world fell downhill even more, because the person i loved the most abandoned me and moved on quickly. i didn't know what to do, but i loved her, so i messaged her saying that im happy she found someone that makes her happy, and that i appreciate the time we spent togheter and im happy we can be friends, she said she genuinely appreciates what i said. seeing her with her boyfriend made me a little bit disgusted, not because i was jealous, but because after all the things we've done togheter, after all the lovely stuff she told me, she chose to be with someone she met right after we decided to take a break, that made me motivated to move on. that day changed something inside of me, as the days after passed by, i realized that i wasn't thinking about her as much, i realized that i didn't really love her anymore.

after 2 weeks, she invites me to grab a coffee. we didn't talk about our dating life. it felt like it used to feel back then. we were just walking and making each other laugh, i still remember how much she laughed when i was telling her funny stuff that happened to me. suddenly, she invites me to come ice skating with her friends in a few days, and i accept. after a few hours, i walk her home where we hug and say goodbye.

when we went ice skating, her boyfriend was there too. i saw them kiss and holding hands while ice skating. that's when i realized that i still love her. it reminded me how a week before we ""broke up"" she told me that she wants to go ice skating and hold hands with me so if we fall, we'll fall togheter. all the memories of the romantic stuff we did togheter came back. it was hard for me to see her do those things with someone else.

i didn't text her at all for 2 weeks afterwards, then suddenly she texts me. it was a meme, a guy looking for hot wheels in a store while his girlfriend was recording with the caption ""pov: you take your eyes off him for 1 second:"" and this girl saying ""you"". i guess it reminded her about how i used to do that while we were shopping and went by the hot wheels section in a store. i don't say anything back, i just like her message.

after a few days, i notice she started to like my stories again, she didn't do that since we ""broke up"".

i genuinely don't know what to do. i feel like she misses me, but a part of me wants to block her and try to move on, the other still wants her in my life even tho all we can ever be is friends. i never loved someone this much, i don't know how to stop those feelings. all i ever wanted was a hug, a ""sorry"" and to be with her, but thats not possible anymore. what can i do?",1,1738398006.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hi guys, I hope you’re all doing well. I (f17) have recently started studying my course (after graduating year 12 last year) it was my third day today and only had a math lecture. The thing about my course is that anyone can do it no matter the age but you have had to have completed year 10. Absolutely no problem with that as I believe the access to learning should never stop at any age. After I had finished my lecture I sat by myself down near all the cafes which my campus provides. As I’m sitting down I see a man (roughly 40s) approaching me and I instantly recognise him as a man from my course, he starts speaking to me but I cannot hear him well as he has a very thick accent and his English wasn’t the best, so I approached him to hear him better. He asked if we were in the same course I said yes he asks me questions, my name etc, he talks about the time table - course related questions very normal stuff, he then asked if I liked coffee - directing his attention to the coffee shop a meter away from us I said kindly, no I don’t like coffee (I recognised if I said yes I would get myself in a situation I would feel uncomfortable in)

Anyway he talks about what he did before coming to campus (another course he did 5 years ago) I nod along say the usual “oh cool” he then says he cannot use the web page which is our schools way of providing materials for classes, announcement’s etc. 

I’m very knowledgeable on how to access the web page and navigate it as it was the same web page I used for my senior years. I ask him do you know how to log in on the school computers, he says yes, and I regrettably offer to help him login to the web page as the password (that the user sets) for the login is the same for the webpage with a few extra steps +the student computers room was right there. I also offered this as he didn’t seem to understand English very well and navigating the web page is even hard for someone who’s English is there first language.

He then continued oh well don’t you have somewhere to be, I smile and say no my friend is picking me up later (she was) - he then asks if I have a boyfriend.. I say no.. he then laughs , he asks who’s picking me up and I say a friend, he then says ohhh a “friend friend” insinuating it was more then a friend. I awkwardly laugh and say no just they’re just my friend, he then says “don’t get the wrong idea, I just don’t want them to think anything’s happen between you and me seeing us together” brother I wanted to die right there. I awkwardly laugh again. 

The conversation ends and he asks me again as we were walking, “do you like coffee” I say no “so what do you drink” he says, “um tea?” he laughs and I feel his hand touch my upper back. I panicked I didn’t know what do so I ignored it, I didn’t want to get him agitated if I said anything. I then realise we are at the coffee shop, he says “get anything you want I’ll buy” I politely decline and just buy a soda for myself as I felt awkward just standing there. 

We then make our way to the student computer room (a room for students who don’t have computers and use the college ones) he makes me walk in front of him and he touches my shoulder this time. I wanted to leave get this over with  as soon as possible. We sit down and then as he’s logging into the computer he says I don’t know how to login as he doesn’t know his password. 

I internally wanted to die because why did he tell me he did know, that was the point of me helping. As I said before the passwords are the same as what you set it on both the computer login and web page login. I say “you’ll have to go IT” he says “you’re coming with me?” Or something along those lines. I don’t know why and I hate myself so much of this but I said “sure” I don’t know what I was thinking, honestly I could of made an excuse or anything (I did later on) 

As we walk to it he says “can we talk about your sexuality” I died inside. I laugh and just say oh haha yea I’m a bi (which I am) he laughs and touches my back again. As soon as we get to IT he makes me walk infront again and touches my shoulder and says “will you wait with me” (as there was a wait line) I finally finally have the courage to make an excuse and that I’m hungry. He looks at me and says while laughing “what I was being so nice before I offered you anything on the menu” I say “no I do appreciate that” he keeps talking about how “nice” he was. 

Anyway I finally leave, I’m not sure what to do as even though we are in different lab groups I will still have a few classes with him. For reference I know I could of left at any time but for some reason my brain was fighting itself not knowing what to do even though he made me really uncomfortable, especially asking about my sexuality- I feel so angry at myself that I didn’t speak up sooner or make an excuse earlier. I felt like I had to just be polite which is absolutely stupid. Half of me blames myself, maybe he thought me helping him was flirting?? But was my body language not enough? Also he kept fist bumping me for some reason. 

I’m scared he’s gonna sit next to me in my classes next week, I’m not sure what to do. I haven’t made any friends or know anyone. Any advice I would love. Thank you if you’ve made it this long I really appreciate it.",8,1738397861.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,4,1.0,False

Anyways, I want some suggestions for a good vibe but morning vibe at the same time, I’m not sure how to describe it.

The Swedish Bible

I am a so-called disabled pensioner with the world’s lowest pension for 20 years this year!! I saved and scraped by for 1.5 years to buy something I never owned - a Bible! I finally got enough money for the study Bible, the big one with 20 thousand notes. I carried it with me almost everywhere in a protective case and in my backpack. So after the fourth service it came with me (I was going to a friend’s right afterwards and that’s why it was in my backpack) I went to the toilet and after that I drank church coffee with many other visitors. At one point I turn around and ”hiccup” when I see how the backpack is, that’s not how I put it. So I get up and go there and almost burst into tears when I lift up an empty backpack, both my new nice Bible and my iPhone that I got from my son who then drove himself to death shortly afterwards were gone without a trace. I don’t have a computer or such a tablet, so my phone was my contact with the outside world. In addition, I have multiple diseases so I panic when I think about the phone. Luckily, I have been able to borrow a phone for a couple of weeks. So I clasp my hands in prayer and if someone or some people here can find in their heart a desire to help me at this time, no one will be more grateful and happy than I will be. 


If you think that you can help, in any way, please…
send a DM and I will reply with an address or a swish number that will be usable. I just have to see if I can activate or what is needed. Then finally, I want to apologize so terribly for sounding like a beggar, if I could have solved this misery in another way, I would have done so. my income is too low to get a loan.

* Tip: Most Ketoites just cannot do without a cup of [Bullet Proof Coffee](https://www.ketoforindia.com/discover-bullet-proof-coffee-keto-tips/). I missed it at work. So I figured out an easy way of having it daily. I carry butter, oil, and coffee in precise quantities in a tumbler to work and just add hot water to it, when I want to have my cuppa!
