I jumped between workout challenges, diet plans, and long productivity checklists but none of them lasted.

What finally helped was doing something so simple that I used to overlook it:

Getting proper sleep at a consistent time
Stepping into sunlight within the first hour after waking
Drinking enough water before my first cup of coffee

Doing these every single day, even when I didn’t feel like it, slowly changed how my body and mind felt. It’s surprising how something as small as going to bed 30 minutes earlier can make you think clearer and handle stress better.

I also came across a short, science-based read that explained why these small daily habits actually work. I added it to my best_guides collection on my profile in case anyone wants to check it out.

You've dreamed of the croissants, the art, the architecture, and that certain *je ne sais quoi* in the air. But you also have a nagging fear: standing out. We've all seen it—the fanny pack-clad tourist shouting in English, map held aloft like a sacrificial offering.

But blending in in France isn't about pretending you're someone you're not. It’s about showing respect for the culture, which in turn opens you up to a more authentic, richer, and frankly, more pleasant experience. If you're wondering **how to not stand out in France**, you’ve come to the right place.

This guide will walk you through the essential tips on fashion, etiquette, and behavior that will have you navigating Parisian streets or a Provençal market with quiet confidence.

## The Unspoken French Dress Code: Less is More

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

French style is legendary, but the secret isn't a massive wardrobe—it's a philosophy of quality over quantity. To blend in, ditch the tourist uniform and embrace a more understated elegance.

### What to Wear

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Neutral Palette:** Think black, navy, grey, beige, and white. These are the building blocks of a French wardrobe. Add a pop of color with a single accessory, like a red scarf or a colorful bag, but keep the base simple.
*   **Invest in Quality, Not Quantity:** One well-fitting, classic coat is better than three trendy ones. Look for good fabrics—wool, cashmere, cotton, linen—that drape well and last.
*   **The Perfect Jeans:** Dark-wash, well-fitting jeans are a staple. Avoid overly ripped, distressed, or low-rise styles. A slim or straight fit is your best bet.
*   **Elegant Shoes:** This is a huge one. Leave the clunky white sneakers and flip-flops at home. Opt for stylish but comfortable leather boots, classic loafers, simple ballet flats, or clean, minimalist sneakers (think Stan Smiths, not chunky dad sneakers).

### What to Avoid

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Logos and Slogans:** Large, visible brand logos or graphic T-shirts are a dead giveaway.
*   **Sportswear (unless you're exercising):** Sweatpants, athletic shorts, and hoodies are reserved for the gym or a run in the park.
*   **Baseball Caps:** Worn casually, they tend to scream ""American tourist.""

## Mastering the Art of French Etiquette

Beyond clothes, how you behave is what truly sets you apart. French social customs are rooted in politeness and a certain formality.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

### The Golden Rule: The *Bonjour*

This is non-negotiable. Whenever you enter a shop, a bakery, a café, or even a small elevator, you *must* say *Bonjour* (or *Bonsoir* in the evening). Make eye contact, give a slight nod, and say it to the staff present. When you leave, say *Au revoir*.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

Forgetting this simple greeting is the fastest way to be perceived as rude or dismissive.

### Dining and Café Culture

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Hands on the Table:** When dining, keep both hands (or at least your wrists) resting on the table, not in your lap. It’s a sign of engagement and respect.
*   **No Splitting the Bill:** It's uncommon to split a bill item-by-item. The easiest way is for one person to pay, and the others settle up with them later using an app like Lydia or just cash.
*   **Slow Down:** Meals are meant to be savored. Don't rush the waiter. They will leave you alone to enjoy your food and wine until you explicitly signal for the check (*l'addition, s'il vous plaît*).
*   **Coffee Etiquette:** Ordering a large, milky coffee in a paper to-go cup is a very touristy thing to do. At a café, you order an *expresso* (espresso) at the bar or a *café crème* (or *café au lait* outside of Paris) at a table. Sit, enjoy the moment, and drink from a real cup.

### General Demeanor

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

*   **Lower Your Volume:** The French, especially in public spaces, tend to speak more softly than many other cultures. Avoid loud conversations and boisterous laughter on the metro or in restaurants.
*   **The Subtle Smile:** Americans are known for their ready smiles. In France, a smile is often reserved for friends or a specific, genuine interaction. Smiling at a stranger on the street might be met with a blank stare. It's not unfriendliness, just a different cultural norm.
*   **Keep a Little Distance:** Personal space is important. Avoid overly familiar gestures like back-slapping someone you've just met.

## A Little French Goes a Long Way

You don't need to be fluent. But making an effort to speak a few key phrases will change how you're treated. It shows respect for the language and culture.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

**Essential Phrases:**

*   Hello/Good day: **Bonjour** (bon-zhoor)
*   Good evening: **Bonsoir** (bon-swahr)
*   Goodbye: **Au revoir** (o ruh-vwah)
*   Please: **S'il vous plaît** (see voo pleh)
*   Thank you: **Merci** (mehr-see)
*   Excuse me / Sorry: **Excusez-moi** (ex-kew-zay mwah) / **Pardon** (par-don)
*   Do you speak English?: **Parlez-vous anglais?** (par-lay voo zon-gleh?)
*   I don't understand: **Je ne comprends pas** (zhuh nuh comp-ron pah)

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

Even if you butcher the pronunciation, the effort is almost always appreciated. Simply starting with, *“Bonjour, excusez-moi. Parlez-vous anglais?”* is infinitely better than launching into English without preamble.

## Putting It All Together: Blending In is a Mindset

Learning **how to not stand out in France** is ultimately about shifting your mindset from that of a consumer to that of a guest. It’s about observing, being present, and respecting the rhythm of life around you.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

You don't need a new wardrobe or a perfect accent. You just need a little awareness.

Dress simply but well. Greet people politely. Speak a little more quietly. Savor your coffee instead of gulping it on the go.

Do these things, and you won't just avoid looking like a tourist. You'll feel more connected, more welcome, and you'll experience the true, subtle magic that makes France so captivating.

1opzzqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1opzzqb/breaking_up_with_someone_who_hasnt_done_anything/,Breaking up with someone who hasn’t done anything wrong. 6 years together.,"We got together back in 2019, when I was 19 and he was 17. I was a virgin and he wasn’t.



During the pandemic, my dad got very sick. He had cancer and later developed a brain disease. He was bedridden and not fully lucid. Later, he got pneumonia and was close to dying. I was completely devastated. My dad was my best friend... I was daddy’s little girl.



At that time, I was studying hard to get into law school and emotionally falling apart. As expected, my sex drive was low (not gone, just... low). One day, while I was sad and talking to my boyfriend about how scared I was that my dad would die, he started groping me, trying to initiate sex. Literally as I said, “I’m afraid my dad will pass soon.”



He was 17, so I told myself it was immaturity, hormones, lack of awareness. But that kind of behavior had already been a pattern. He would often try to “get me in the mood” after I’d said no... asking to touch me, to undress, to do things to me even when I said I wasn’t up for it. I often gave in because I didn’t want him to feel rejected or undesired. I thought that was what a good girlfriend was supposed to do.



The last straw was that day when I was grieving and he still tried to get off. So I asked him to stop doing that.



To his credit, he stopped and has somewhat respected my boundaries ever since. He almost never initiates sex and I do just because when I don't, I feel bad about it. It’s been four years, and he’s never crossed that line again. He uses to make little comments to see if I'm open to it or not, only suggesting he wants to do it.



But something inside me is still broken, even after all that time.



Ever since, I’ve never truly felt physical desire for him again. I'm almost repulsed, even. I fake it. The arousal, the orgasms, the interest. I say I need lube because of birth control, but the truth is, I just don’t get wet. I don’t want to be touched. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve become asexual.



Outside of that, we’ve grown apart too. I’ve become an adult. I graduated, became a lawyer, I work, pay bills, run errands, handle responsibilities. Meanwhile, he still lives like a teenager. Although he’s in an IT program, he plays video games all day everyday, and does his homework. That’s it. He doesn’t drive, doesn’t take public transportation, doesn’t cook, doesn’t clean his own room, and has literally never been grocery shopping in his life. His mom drives him everywhere. He doesn’t solve anything by himself.



When I imagine living with him, I don’t feel excited. I feel anxious. The thought of sharing a life or a home with him feels exhausting. I know I’d end up carrying everything - emotionally, financially, practically - and I already feel drained just thinking about it.



So why do I stay?



I figured a miserable sex life was the price to pay for having a somewhat great partner, in the other areas?



I mean, he’s not a bad person. He’s caring, patient, gentle, affectionate, calm, and is always there for me when I need him to. He’s loyal, and he genuinely tries to please me in bed (I promise, trust my word on that, so I don't have to get into too much detail, TMI), even though I have to fake it. He’s calm and never pressures me anymore. He learnt how to cook rice, pasta and make coffee for me. He tries to make me feel loved by my love language (acts of service). I know he loves me and I do care about him... but it feels like brotherly affection, not romantic love.



I love hanging out with him… but for a short amount of time. Not the entire weekend. When he comes over sooner or goes home later than usual, I get stressed. 



I’ve realized I’m staying mostly out of guilt and fear: guilt for hurting him, fear of regretting it, fear of being alone. I keep hoping he’ll change, grow up, become independent… but when he takes small steps in that direction, I just feel nothing. Not pride, not attraction... just impatience.



I think I’ve already emotionally left the relationship, but my body and mind haven’t caught up yet. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t want to marry him out of habit and spend the rest of my life pretending to want sex or affection. I don’t think this is how love should feel, even after years together.



I'm currently in therapy and taking the courage to leave him. 



He deserves someone better. Someone that has the same sex drive as him. Someone who’ll be patient to wait for him to become an adult at his own pace.

this is a bit of a long story, but i want to include as much detail as possible to avoid any bias as im seeking genuine perspectives/advice. thank you in advance for reading and helping me out :)


Me 19F and my boyfriend 20M have been together for two years now. things are overall good. but theres this itch in my head that’s getting a bit restless, for a lack of better words. i feel it’s also important to note that he is my first serious relationship, and my first everything.

we used to fight a lot. it started when i got on a new birth control (the depo provera) which is known for making users more emotionally unstable than usual. i had a really hard time on it; irritable, depressive, anxious all the time. i also had a really huge fear of him cheating on me, which i know is moreso tied to past experience and not tied to my boyfriend’s character at all.

i say this because despite everything, he has really been there for me and has stayed by my side through all of my hormonal stress, university stress, etc. has held me when i cried, has stayed when i would pick fights uselessly and reminded me when it was the hormones taking control to ground me again. when we have real arguments they can last hours because we’re both incredibly stubborn, but we never go to bed in an argument, we always fix it first. i am eternally grateful for him for sticking around and being there for me when i was going through one of the worst periods of my life.

now that im off the birth control things have changed a lot for the better. im fresh off of it so i do get more emotional when it comes to my period or ovulation, which can start arguments. however, my boyfriend is really supportive and understanding and we went from fighting twice or more a day to maybe once every two weeks. my point is that things feel normal in our relationship again, almost like they did when we first started dating.

my concern is this; while things certainly feel healthier, they dont feel as fun anymore. i understand there’s a certain degree of ‘honeymoon phase’ attributed to a relationship. in our first year of going out, he was a college student working part time and would buy me flowers occasionally, take me out on dates, buy me coffee, etc. It was never anything excessive nor have i ever expected that from him, but there were definitely a lot of small gestures that made me feel special and that just made me feel like his girlfriend if that makes sense. even back then i would also split bills or pay for things on my own as we were both students. i would also try to get him things to make him happy, like a TV i had bought him for his room because he didnt have one. my point is that i never expected him to give me anything that i wouldnt do in return for him.

things arent like that anymore. my boyfriend graduated college and is now working full time making double minimum wage, and yet everything has stopped. when he was between jobs before, it was me paying for all our dates, our coffees, etc while being a full time student. youd think that now that he had a stable job making a generous income, with little to no bills to pay, things would have gone back to normal with us going on dates and maybe the occasional bouquet of flowers. but no. ill even offer to cover the full bill when asking to go out on a date, but he tells me he’ll feel bad letting that happen so he would rather just stay in anyway. i have found myself starting numerous big fights over the past few months over this. i dont mean to seem materialistic, but i cant deny that i feel special receiving flowers and small gestures, and it makes me sad that he doesnt do any of that anymore. i love to give gifts and it makes me happy to receive thoughtful ones back. he literally got me a box of coffee k-pods for christmas last year… a 12 count box. am i nuts or is that just not cool??

i guess what im trying to get at is the fact that i feel stuck. i love him so much and he has done so much for me by sticking by me in my hardest times, but i often find myself feeling really upset that none of these small things are happening anymore. i swear i try not to be a materialistic person, but is it materialistic to wish your boyfriend put thought and effort into trying to do small things to make you happy? i see all of my friends receiving flowers from their boyfriends monthly, if not biweekly, along with much more extravagant things like full trips paid for, promise rings, etc, and im not even asking for any of that!!! I just want to feel special too at the end of the day.

i have communicated all of this with him numerous times, but nothing has changed. the last bouquet i received was for valentines day, and he bought me a chocolate bar when i was on my period two weeks ago, but before then, i cant remember the last time hes gifted me anything. i just hate to imagine a future of me at 30 where ill have never received a grand gesture, or even something simple but thoughtful planned out for one of my birthdays. i keep telling myself that im being posh and materialistic, but at the same time i work hard and i try my best to be the best person i can be for him, so why cant i have the kind of love everyone else seems to get? but then again, i put him through hell, so do i really deserve any of this stuff anyway?

do you guys think im just being materialistic and ungrateful? or am i giving him too much slack for something ive brought up to him many times..? is this just a phase and have some of you felt the same way? please just be brutally honest with me. ive only been able to bring this up with my mom and shes obviously biased and telling me i deserve better. 


TLDR: im having a hard time telling whether im being overly dramatic and materialistic about my boyfriend no longer doing small gestures (buying flowers, going on dates) despite asking for change, and im unsure whether this is grounds for a bigger conversation or not.

I'm planning out some of the logistics, and one thing I can't quite figure out is how to keep food in the cooler cold.

In the US, most any gas station or grocery store will sell bagged ice and a good quality cooler will keep it cold for multiple days, depending on the ambient temperatures.  We usually buy food to cook at the campground, like chicken or steaks, as well as some milk for coffee and cereal (and beer, of course), and keep it all the cooler, buying some ice every so often as needed.

My plan was to just buy a cooler when I get there and do the same thing.  However from what Dr. Google is telling me, ice rarely sold like that.  However summer temps where I'm going are still often 25-30C.  In my experience tossing a couple frozen water bottles in a cooler is nowhere near enough to keep food safe in those conditions, and I don't have any way to freeze a water bottle regardless.

Mi sto avvicinando al mondo dello specialty coffee, da un po' di tempo sbircio questo sub e sto imparando molto grazie ai post e alla wiki (grazie davvero, sono stati super utili!).  
  
Sto cercando di fare le cose con calma per non bruciare tappe (e soldi 😅): nel tempo ho preso il filtro E&B per la moka più un Kingrinder K6, passando dalle miscele pre-macinate a dei monorigine in chicchi.  
Bevo con la moka in media un caffè al giorno (7-8g con moka da 1 tazza - sono l’unico che beve caffè in casa).

I prossimi passi che vorrei fare sarebbero aggiungere un metodo di estrazione e passare al caffè speciality. Su questi temi ho qualche dubbio e mi piacerebbe sentire il parere di qualcuno più esperto.

**Nuovo metodo di estrazione**  
Sto valutando **AeroPress, V60 o Hario Switch** — al momento sono più orientato sulla AeroPress, che mi sembra più semplice e veloce per iniziare.  
Secondo voi è una buona scelta o conviene partire da altro?

**Scegliere il caffè**  
Non so bene come scegliere i primi caffè speciality.  
Preferisco profili più corposi e cioccolatosi, e al momento evito quelli acidi (forse sono ancora abituato al caffè all'italiana)  
Pensavo di cercare un box degustazione con piccole quantità, ma ho trovato solo abbonamenti o pacchi da 250g (un po’ troppi per me, anche se potrei congelarli) - conoscete qualcuno che fa degustazioni con micro-dosi?  
In alternativa potrei andare in qualche bar/rivenditore della mia città (Bologna) e farmi consigliare di persona, ma potrei provare 2 caffè al massimo.  
Che consigliate?

Current weight: 171lbs
Age: 30s
Height: 5ft 9in

Let me tell you about my journey and what has worked and what hasn’t. 

I sat at my doctors feeling uncomfortable when she told me I had insulin resistance and was pre diabetic. She gave me a couple of years before I became diabetic. I was bummed to say the least. I have seen how diabetes leads to high blood pressure, strokes, amputations and dialysis. I wanted to be healthy and I had always tried my best to eat and stay healthy. However, as much as I tried nothing seemed to work. I have tried every diet under the sun. To say I was frustrated was the least.

She recommended Ozempic. I was like “the Kardashians weight loss med? No way! That causes so many problem.” My doctor mentioned that the clinical trials were done on diabetic patients. Many of the side effects reported on this med were also side effects of diabetes. I said ok and she sent the prescription to the pharmacy. Insurance didn’t cover it and I thought “how the hell am I supposed to pay an extra rent to afford these meds?”. They were going to be $1,600 a month without insurance. 

Started with Rybelsus (oral semaglutide-$250/mo) about a year ago. Only lost 7lbs in 7 months. Switched to Tirz. Highest was 2.5mg and I had ridiculous amounts of energy and had some appetite control. Didn’t go higher because I found Reta. I was not patient and was going up on the dosage weekly, sometimes twice a week if I tolerated. I was still doing Tirz 5mg and Reta 5mg- I noticed some weight loss here but it was slow and needed the Tirz for appetite control. I was pinning twice a week for a total of T5mg and R5mg.

Somewhere along the lines I stopped Tirz and increased to one shot a week of 6mg with a little more increased weight loss and appetite control. Then 10mg a week which is my current dose and the weight started melting off. I average about 10lbs/month. 

I started in May. I’m also not the poster child of how weight loss on Reta should be done. I had a hard time eating my protein. I could do one meal a day a be okay. I wouldn’t always eat the healthiest. And I wouldn’t reach my water goals either. With this came a lot of fatigue and hair loss. 

The bad: 
-Muscle loss
-Knees are so “crunchy”, fatigue (lessened with eating more)
-Increased POTS symptoms (dizziness with standing up)
-Hair loss
-Body dysmorphia (I’ll still feel fat and I think it comes from not being used to being this small)
-Coffee doesn’t wake me up anymore 🥲 hello Yerba Mate and Coke Zero
-Foods I used to love and get a “high” from don’t taste the same. 
-Occasional irritation at pin site 
-Nausea the day after pinning. I use peppermint oil. Zofran doesn’t do much.
-Craving a good and getting the ick halfway through eating it 

The good: 
-Not thinking about food 24/7. 
-Eating food and not worrying about gaining weight. I used to wonder how people could have McDonald’s for breakfast and still be slim. I felt like that privilege was not for me.
-I have never had a body this small for decades. How did I go from a size XXL to a medium?
-I can nourish my body without having to fight cravings 
-Less impulsive shopping. Really noticed this with Tirz, a little less with Reta

Tips:
-Stairway to grey 🩶 allowed me to reach a healthier weight while still being accessible. 
-I bought a case of Hospira BAC. Probably unnecessary but it was when there was a shortage.
-My BAC set up is: vial spike clave (this allows me to connect the syringe without having to poke the vial every time leading to increased infection), I cap the vial spike with a green Curos cap, I keep the BAC vial in a 3D printed box I bought and in the fridge, every time I use the BAC I take off the Curos, wipe with alcohol, draw and place a new Curos cap.
-The friction is what gets the bacteria off. So don’t wipe lightly
-I double check my math
-I keep my Reta frozen until it’s time to reconstitute. 
-Separate 3D printed box for reconstituted peptides in the fridge
-I use a medical supply online store to buy my supplies 

*Im very open about my journey when people ask about my weight loss because I hope that if anyone needs it they know it’s an option. You don’t have to tell anyone your business as well. The only negative comment I once got was: “you’re just lying to yourself. Counting calories and working out works. You just want it easy.” I just take this as people being narrow minded and ignoring there are a million universes out there in each person.

Again, this is not medical advice and I’m not perfect. This is just my journey. These medications have been life changing and I hope that everyone who needs them is able to get them at a good price. 

You deserve being healthy, looking hot, and loving your body. Get it girl! 🫡

*I have a friend with autoimmune disease that is on Reta/Tirz and another one on Tirz so any questions about that are welcome. One of them reversed a fatty liver with Reta.

Start by identifying your goals for the morning. Do you want to exercise, meditate, or simply enjoy a quiet cup of coffee? Once you know your priorities, create a schedule that includes specific time slots for each activity. It's essential to begin with manageable tasks. For instance, if you want to exercise, start with just 10 minutes of stretching or a short walk. Gradually increase the intensity as you become more comfortable. Additionally, prepare the night before by laying out your clothes or prepping your breakfast. This will reduce decision fatigue and help you stick to your plan. Lastly, remain flexible and adjust your routine as needed. Life can be unpredictable, so it's okay to modify your morning rituals to keep them enjoyable and effective.

1opztlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1opztlt/mile_marker_23/,Mile Marker 23,"**Recovered from County Records, Case File 11-327B.**

The following is a transcription of an interview conducted at the Burstner Police Department on March 14th (Monday), 2018.

Subject: Daniel R. Holt, 43, truck driver.  
Purpose: Voluntary statement regarding a missing person, *Anna B.*, reported missing June 2017. 

GPS records later indicated Holt’s vehicle was stationary for six hours near Mile Marker 23, Highway 7, an undeveloped stretch with no nearby towns. No follow-up report was filed.

**TRANSCRIPT BEGINS**

**DET. RAINES:** Alright, Mr. Holt, this is just a statement for the record. You said you wanted to report a possible sighting of a missing person, is that correct?

**HOLT:** Yes, sir. That’s right. I, uh, saw her last Thursday. Thought it’d be good to tell someone.

**DET. RAINES:** And you saw her where?

**HOLT:** In Josefville. There’s a diner right off the main road, you can pull right in. Simple name, *Josefville Diner*, I think it was. Saw her working there.

**DET. RAINES:** Josefville? How’s that spelled, with a Y?

**HOLT:** Like Joseph without the *ph*. German sounding. J-O-S-E-F-V-I-L-L-E. Pretty sure that’s right.

**DET. RAINES:** *(Sips coffee)* And this was March 8th, correct?

**HOLT:** Last Thursday, yeah. I was coming down from upstate with a load of timber, big storm came in around mile twenty. Roads were slick, so I pulled over around mile twenty-three. Figured I’d grab some coffee and wait it out.

**DET. RAINES:** Now, you said you saw a poster of her before this.

**HOLT:** Yeah, gas station a couple miles back had her on the bulletin board. 

**DET. RAINES:** The one with the red border?

**HOLT:** That’s the one.

**DET. RAINES:** You’re sure this was her?

**HOLT:** Same face, no doubt about it. Freckles across the bridge of her nose. She had her hair up when I saw her though. Ponytail. Looked older maybe. Tired. But it was her.

**DET. RAINES:** Yeah, sounds like her. Did she tell you her name?

**HOLT:** No, but she called me Danny. Never told her my name, didn’t speak to anybody there. That’s what made me stop eating for a second. Danny. Like she already knew me.

**DET. RAINES:** And that didn’t seem unusual to you?

**HOLT:** People guess right sometimes.

**DET. RAINES:** *(After a pause)* She said that to you? “Danny”?

**DET. RAINES:** *(Clears throat)* Can you describe the place?

**HOLT:** Small town, one street, maybe two. Lot of shuttered stores. There was a hardware place with the windows taped up, convenience store with nothing on the shelves. Right by it, the diner. Cozy place, I’d go back. Not too many diners left where I’m from.

**DET. RAINES:** Now, you’re sure that’s the name? Josefville?

**HOLT:** Yeah, that’s right. Officer Ranes, it was?

**DET. RAINES:** *Raines*. Yes.

**HOLT:** Right, sorry. You were the one last time right?

**DET. RAINES:** Last time?

**HOLT:** Yeah, I came in Monday, I think. Same room. You had a coffee mug, said “Best Dad in Burstner”.

**DET. RAINES:** *(Pause)* No, sir, this is the first time we’ve spoken.

**HOLT:** Huh. Must be mixing you guys up. Same chair, though.

**DET. RAINES:** Let’s go back to the diner.

**HOLT:** Even has that little patch there.

**DET. RAINES:** Right. In any case, what time did you arrive at the diner?

**HOLT:** Just after midnight, or maybe closer to one, I parked the rig behind the place, next to a dumpster. Lights were still on inside. Only one car out front, green sedan. Might’ve been hers.

**DET. RAINES:** You went in and ordered coffee?

**HOLT:** One regular, one to go. She said, “you’ll want pie with that”, and I said sure, whatever she’s got. Wasn’t very good, the apples had gone bad a while back, and the crust was burned. Coffee was alright though.

**DET. RAINES:** Anyone else there?

**HOLT:** Nah, not even a cook. She said he’d stepped out for smokes. She just kept wiping the counters like she’d been doing it for hours. Kept glancing up at the clock. The hands weren’t moving. Completely still, like they’d clocked out before her.

**DET. RAINES:** Did you think that was unusual?

**HOLT:** I thought the battery was dead. I didn't really think much about it.

**DET. RAINES:** Did she seem nervous or upset?

**HOLT:** No. Just quiet. Like she was waiting for me to say something.

**DET. RAINES:** And then?

**HOLT:** We talked a bit. Told her the road was flooding near the ridge, she said she’d lived there her whole life and it always did that. I said something about closing up for storms and she laughed. Said, “We don’t close too often, Danny”.

**DET. RAINES:** She said that exactly?

**HOLT:** Word for word. Then she topped up my cup and asked how long I’d been driving. Normal chat, mostly. Nothing weird until I went out.

**DET. RAINES:** What happened then?

**HOLT:** I slept in the cab a few hours. Woke up to the sun. Road was dry. No diner, no buildings. Just the mile marker and some trees.

(*Pause. Sound of chair movement)*

**DET. RAINES:** You mean the town was gone.

**HOLT:** I mean it wasn’t there. Like I’d parked in the wrong spot, but there’s nowhere else it could’ve been.

**HOLT:** I’ve got the receipt from the diner, as a matter of fact.

*(Paper rustles)*

**DET. RAINES:** This looks handwritten. 

**HOLT:** Well, it was what she gave me.

**DET. RAINES:** Alright, Mr. Holt. I’ll keep this for the record. You said you were at the diner until about two in the morning?

**HOLT:** Maybe a quarter past. I don’t wear a watch.

**DET. RAINES:** And you went straight back on the highway?

**HOLT:** Yeah. Came back to the truck near the marker, twenty-three, it was. Slept a bit before going on.

**DET. RAINES:** And that’s where the GPS puts you. But there’s nothing out there, sir. Just trees and a service road.

**HOLT:** That’s what you keep saying.

**DET. RAINES:** We’ve checked twice. There’s no “Josefville Diner”.

**HOLT:** Maybe not now.

**DET. RAINES:** What do you mean?

**HOLT:** Just that things can change overnight. I’ve seen road crews put up whole signs before breakfast.

**DET. RAINES:** What kind of sign are we talking about?

**HOLT:** Big red letters. Flickered a little. Or maybe I just remember it that way.

**DET. RAINES:** Did you ever see that diner before last night?

**HOLT:** No. Unless… no, guess not. Funny though, I felt I had.

**DET. RAINES:** This came in with the file.

**HOLT:** What file, on me?

*(Paper rustling)*

**DET. RAINES:** This is a state road map. Highway Seven, all the way through to the county line. You see any diner marked there?

**HOLT:** No, that’s not the same one.

**DET. RAINES:** This is the only official map.

**HOLT:** The other one had a pencil mark. Right about there.

**DET. RAINES:** I haven’t shown you any other map, sir.

*(Silence)*

**HOLT:** Maybe that was the other fella.

**DET. RAINES:** What fella?

**HOLT:** The one you had in here before. Looked a lot like you, though the hair was darker.

**DET. RAINES:** Mr. Holt, I’m the only one you’ve spoken to.

**HOLT:** Yeah. I keep forgetting that.

*(Short silence. Chair creaks.)*

**DET. RAINES:** Do you remember what Anna said when you left?

**HOLT:** Something about not staying too long. I didn’t think much of it.

**DET. RAINES:** Why not?

**HOLT:** Sounded like good advice.

*(Pause. Shuffling. A distant knock on the door.)*

**DET. RAINES:** We’ll take a short break.

**HOLT:** Sure. You’ll come back, right?

*(Unintelligible reply. Recording ends.)*

**TRANSCRIPT CONTINUES - 10:16 AM**

**DET. HELLER:** Morning, Mr. Holt. I’m Detective Heller. Detective Raines had to step out for a bit.

**HOLT:** You were here earlier.

**DET. HELLER:** No, sir. First time meeting you.

**HOLT:** Huh. You sound the same on the tape.

**DET. HELLER:** *(Pause)* We just want to clear up a few things, alright?

**HOLT:** Sure. I’m just telling you what I saw.

**DET. HELLER:** Of course. You mentioned you parked near Mile Marker 23. Can you recall if there were any other landmarks?

**HOLT:** Power lines, maybe. Hard to say. Everything looked washed out, maybe because of the storm.

**DET. HELLER:** You said earlier the road was dry when you woke.

**HOLT:** Funny, that.

**DET. HELLER:** Let’s get back on track. Did Anna mention anyone by name? Anybody she… still talks to?

**HOLT:** No. But she kept looking at the window. Not out, at. It was strange, really. Like she was watching for a reflection.

**DET. HELLER:** What was outside the window?

**HOLT:** Just the sign. Josefville Diner, in red. Like I told your partner.

**DET. HELLER:** Partner?

**HOLT:** Detective Raines.

**DET. HELLER:** I’m not his partner, sir.

*(Long pause. Paper shuffling.)*

**DET. HELLER:** When you woke up, did you notice any tire tracks, footprints, anything at all that would show there was a building there?

**HOLT:** Just gravel. A patch where the grass was pressed down, like a lot of cars had come through. But it looked old. Like weeks old.

**DET. HELLER:** You said before you had a receipt.

**HOLT:** Yeah. You’ve got it now.

**DET. HELLER:** There’s no date written on it. Or any useful information, really.

**HOLT:** Maybe it faded. Looked fresh when she gave it to me.

**DET. HELLER:** Mr. Holt, have you ever been treated for any sleep-related conditions?

**HOLT:** That’s what you think this is? I know what I saw.

**DET. HELLER:** Of course. I’m just asking. Long-haul work can blur the days together.

**HOLT:** Then tell me why she knew my name. Tell me why that diner had my brand of coffee. You can’t buy Mariner’s Roast anywhere around here. Only place I’ve seen it’s in my truck.

*(Low murmur. Unintelligible exchange. A door opens and closes.)*

**DET. RAINES:** Everything alright?

**DET. HELLER:** We’re fine. Just going over details.

**DET. RAINES:** You get anything new?

**DET. HELLER:** Not yet. He mentioned coffee brands.

**DET. RAINES:** Coffee?

**HOLT:** Mariner’s Roast. That’s what you served me when I came in Monday.

*(Pause.)*

**DET. RAINES:** Sir, we don’t even have a coffee machine here.

**HOLT:** You sure about that?

*(Sound of chair movement)*

**DET. HELLER:** Let’s take another short break.

**HOLT:** Yeah. Good idea. You’ll come back, right?

*(Recording ends.)*

**TRANSCRIPT CONTINUES - 10:48 a.m.**

**DET. RAINES:** Alright, Mr. Holt, just a few final questions before we close this out.

**HOLT:** Sure thing.

**DET. RAINES:** You said you stopped around midnight, March 8th. What time did you get back on the road?

**HOLT:** Must’ve been early, maybe six. Sun had just come up.

**DET. HELLER:** Six. You’re certain?

**HOLT:** As certain as I can be. Still felt pretty wiped.

*(Pause)*

**DET. RAINES:** Our records show your truck didn’t move until just before noon.

**HOLT:** That’s not right. I was gone long before that.

**DET. RAINES:** The tracker’s time-stamped, sir.

**HOLT:** Then it’s wrong. Maybe the signal dropped. Happens out there.

**DET. HELLER:** Did you step out at all during that time?

**HOLT:** No. Just slept, like I said.

**DET. HELLER:** You only sleep four hours?

**HOLT:** Guess so.

*(Someone loudly exhales.)*

**DET. RAINES:** Mr. Holt, we’ve looked through that stretch. There’s no diner, no town, no nothing.

**HOLT:** Maybe you missed it.

**DET. RAINES:** We didn’t.

**HOLT:** Then maybe it’s gone now.

*(Short silence.)*

**DET. RAINES:** You ever met Anna before she went missing? Drive by her old route before?

**HOLT:** No. Why would I? Everyone keeps asking that.

**DET. RAINES:** Nevermind.

**HOLT:** You keep looking like I’m supposed to say something else.

**DET. HELLER:** We’re just making sure the record’s complete.

*(Low hum from the overhead light.)*

**DET. RAINES:** Mr. Holt, there’s nothing to substantiate what you’ve described. No building foundations, no record of any business by that name.

**HOLT:** Maybe you should ask the county office. They’d have it on file.

**DET. RAINES:** We already did.

**HOLT:** Oh. *(Pause)* You asked under the right name?

**DET. RAINES:** *(Quietly)* Yes.

*(Short pause. Someone shifts in their chair.)*

**DET. HELLER:** Think we’ve got what we need.

**DET. RAINES:** Agreed. Mr. Holt, you’re free to go.

**HOLT:** That’s it?

**DET. RAINES:** Unless you remember something new.

**HOLT:** You’ll call?

**DET. HELLER:** If there’s reason to.

*(A long pause. Chair movement. The door opens, muffled hallway sound.)*

**DET. RAINES:** Make sure the statement copy goes to Records today.

**DET. HELLER:** I thought we already logged it.

**DET. RAINES:** That was the draft from Monday. This one’s cleaner.

**DET. HELLER:** Right. Same tag?

**DET. RAINES:** Yeah. Use the June file, same one for Anna, keep it consistent.

**DET. HELLER:** You want me to overwrite or attach?

**DET. RAINES:** Just attach for now.

**DET. HELLER:** Should I flag the duplicate?

**DET. RAINES:** No, leave it. It matches close enough.

*(Paper shuffling. Recorder hums louder for a few seconds, then cuts out.)*

1opzqad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1opzqad/i_have_absolutely_no_idea_what_happened_here/,i have absolutely no idea what happened here.,"i met someone at a wedding. before speaking to them, two different friends whispered in my ear they seemed interested. these are friends whose judgment i trust. the person they were referring to was with a date so i told my friends to cut it out. but my friends were absolutely right: i caught them furtively sneaking looks at me every few seconds. it seemed excessive, to be honest. and they kept walking right by us again and again - sneaking a quick look and then heading to the restroom.

somehow, we eventually got introduced. i can’t remember how; probably while dancing. without hyperbole, they followed me around all night from that point onward. each time i went outside, they’d magically appear in thirty seconds. they’re next to me in every photograph from the wedding - which is notable because those photos were taken before we spoke. but it turned out we have a lot of things in common. i thought we became friends. i actually admired them after getting to know them, and they seemed to feel similarly. i didn’t ask for their details before leaving because i lived on the west coast at the time and didn’t think i’d move back to where the wedding took place (i used to live there). it seemed like we would’ve hung out again if i had lived there.

life took an unexpected turn. i moved back. they came up in conversation with a friend. apparently they broke up with the person they attended the wedding with. life had finally settled down in my new home so i decided to reach out. i reckoned we’d just catch up over coffee, or whatever. my friend thought nothing of it. i found them in less than two minutes using their first name, alma mater, and specialty - essentially what little i could remember about them. i didn’t know how else to find them, and i didn’t think this was unusual. linkedin is nevertheless cringe, though, and i didn’t know if they use the platform much. so i sent a message just in case, but i reached out to friends for their phone number in the meantime. only one friend had it. they had never used it - they got it at the wedding - and weren’t even sure it was actually their’s because they’d never used it. evidently, none of them know this person well, if at all. i was warned this person is “a bit off” and “strange”. no one was too specific about what that meant but i could tell i was being tacitly warned. apparently there were a couple of strange encounters while i was on the west coast.

i sent a text. friendly. two weeks pass. no reply. a recruiter messages me on linkedin, and i see the person i messaged had blocked my profile. seemed like cut and dry disinterest. i felt bad for double-messaging; they may not know i didn’t know how to reach them. so i texted again in order to apologize for bothering them, clarified there weren’t any hard feelings, and said farewell. i thought this matter was closed. life moved on.

two weeks later, i notice they unblocked me on linkedin, and i observe like five or six different fake linkedin profiles viewing my profile. i do nothing, assume nothing. two days later, i get a phone call from my best friend - the groom at the wedding i mentioned above. they say that person’s ex - the person they attended the wedding with - called on that person’s behalf. apparently they felt “uncomfortable”. i asked my friend why this was happening all of a sudden. it had been weeks since i said farewell. they weren’t sure. but i was explicitly told, “i definitely wouldn’t contact them again” and “i think everyone goes their separate ways”. they also said they received a screenshot of my depop profile?! evidently, unbeknownst to me, i had been messaging them there. i looked through my like/message history just in case. of course, i didn’t find anything; there was no mistake. i changed my username and profile photo, again, just to be safe. my friend explicitly said, “i don’t know why i got dragged into this instead of them speaking to you”, and they assured me i didn’t do anything wrong. they also clarified many times they believe this person is a little nuts. my friend also clarified my farewell message arrived two days after this person officially broke up with their partner - the person they attended the wedding with. apparently their earlier break-up wasn’t total. my friend implied this escalation may have been a reaction to perceived rejection or that they were intending to use me as a rebound option.

for weeks, they left me unblocked. eventually, i reinstated the block for them so as to respect the boundary - and also because i was tired of seeing their face in my inbox. for someone so uncomfortable, that seems like an odd oversight. during that time, i noticed fake linkedin profiles continuing to check my page periodically - which never happened before this began. 

i’m not hung up on this person, and i trust i don’t need to explain why. what upsets me is how trying to reconnect with an ostensible friend completely blew up in my face. it’s a major breach of trust and faith for me. i value clarity; this experience doesn’t make any sense to me, so Zeigarnik effect has been in full-swing for me.

i realize you all don’t have access to this person’s mind. my friends don’t know what happened either, and they’ve all expressed zero surprise how they behaved this way. but i’m curious nonetheless if anyone can give insight into what tf may have happened here. i’ve never experienced anything like this before, and this doesn’t make any sense to me.

Sorry for the long post...

Hopefully someone can provide additional insight to a situation I'm trying to weigh options on.

I'm an executor of an estate (also a major beneficiary). I'm near the end of finalizing distribution. Initially, I wasn't planning in taking an executor fee BUT I realized I had unused RRSP contributions that I could apply against the executor fee and offset nearly tax implications.

Now, I know the correct way to handle this is with a T4 issued by the estate. That means applying for a business number and cra payroll account. Given we are in the final stages and not wanting to carry this over to 2026 that seems like a hassle I just don't want to embark on at this time.

My personal accountant (very good, been with him for over 20 years) suggested reporting the income on line 10800. He says it's not ideal given the amount and that T4 is the correct way to go but that it's perfectly acceptable as well.

My concern with this approach is that I've always been under the assumption that reporting a high dollar amount (90K) in this way is more likely to invite an audit. I don't have anything to hide with my taxes but I also just don't need the headache at this point in time either.

The difference in net inheritance would be an additional 40K in receiving the executors fee vs not receiving it. That's real money BUT it's also basically coffee money compared to what I've inherited. The person whose money this is spent their entire life optimizing their financial position and never left money on the table. I feel like it would be a disservice to their work and memory if I didn't do that for myself with THEIR money but the hassle headache is very real for me these days. I have enough going on with other family members who are ill, work, etc that are stretching my bandwidth. Dealing with CRA might just break me lol

Curious to hear feedback. Like I said, I trust the opinion of my CPA as he has served me well for over 20 years. I'm just looking for additional viewpoints that I might not have considered before making a final decision.

I matched with a girl, I didn't find her stunning, but she wasn't ugly either. Just a regular average girl (not saying it in a bad way just that I wasn't like ""omg I'm in love with her"").

We talked a bit over a few days, about what she does for a living, she was a dance teacher for people with moving disabilities, I'm a sociology master's student so we talked about that too. We talked about my ""mémoire"" (I'm french, it's basically a mini thesis you write to validate your master's), I even sent her my advancement at the time by email.

Thing is a few days ago I talked about it with a friend during a random convo, and he was surprised at the fact I didnt propose her a date even after talking for ""that long"". And I was like ""but this is not that long at all to me"" and he told me people usually propose a date for a coffee or drinks withing the first few days they talk on tinder. That surprised me, because to me I only want to go on a date with a girl I love, and so only talking for a few days I feel its not enough. Plus I would feel like a creep for offering a date so soon, like we barely know each other.  
So that got me wondering a few things, which are after how long/how big of a conversation on a dating app would you propose a date to someone, how to do so, and how to behave during the date ? Because I also know I would be stressed out thinking about sitting right, saying the right thing, not using foul language, etc.

TL;DR : convo with friend got me wondering after how long and how would you ask someone on a date from a dating app. I feel it's too soon if I'm not in love with the person so I don't ask.",1,1762437602.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1opzo0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1opzo0k/ketl_mountain_apparel_gear_review_after_8_months/,Ketl Mountain Apparel Gear Review After 8 months,"I picked up three pieces from Ketl Mountain Apparel back in February, and after 8 months of heavy use across multiple activities, I figured it was time to share my honest thoughts. For context: I mountain bike 3-4 times a week, do occasional trail running, and travel fairly regularly. I was looking for gear that could pull double duty without looking too ""technical"" or costume-y. Here's how Ketl's performed:

TOMFOOLERY TRAVEL PANTS
These pants have genuinely surprised me. I was skeptical about $95 pants, but they've become the most-worn item in my wardrobe. The stretch fabric feels almost like athletic wear but looks like casual chinos. I've worn them mountain biking, on flights to three different countries, hiking in Utah, and out to breweries/dinners.

The Good: The stretch is insane, full range of motion on the bike with zero restriction. They're water and stain repellent, which has saved me multiple times (coffee spills, mud splatter, etc.). The zipper pockets are deep and secure, my phone has never fallen out. They pack down incredibly small in my travel bag. After 8 months and probably 30+ washes, they still look nearly new with minimal wear.

The Not-So-Good: They can show sweat stains in high-heat situations (though they dry quickly). The waistband is comfortable but it stretches, most of the time I like that but sometimes they don't feel snug enough without a belt or tying the drawstring.

VIRTUE HYBRID SHORTS
I have the 12"" inseam version, and these are now my go-to MTB shorts that I also use for all sorts of other stuff. The fabric is noticeably softer and stretchier than competitors like Fox or Troy Lee. I'm 5'10"", 170 lbs, and the medium fits perfectly, true to their sizing chart.

The Good: Legitimately the most comfortable shorts I've worn on multi-hour rides. The stretch and how light they are is perfect when pedaling. The two front pockets are both deep and have zippers on them, I regularly carry my phone, keys, snacks, and a multi-tool. The waistband closure system (Belt w/ G-hook + snap button) is secure and easy to adjust on the fly. Most importantly, these things just actually breathe, and I never feel like I get hot in them. I have actually also tested out the ""hybrid"" aspect and gone swimming in them, and they were awesome for that as well.

The Not-So-Good: These are NOT burly enduro/DH shorts. Mine have held up incredibly well, but the fabric does seem so light that I could imagine them tearing if you really crashed yourself in these. They're not cheap at $80, though I've found similar quality shorts run $120-150 And these frankly just look better.

WAYWARD TOP
I have both the short and long sleeve versions. This has become my default top for literally every outdoor activity. The fabric is light, breathes pretty well but is actually durable.

The Good: The moisture-wicking is excellent even on humid 85 degree rides, it doesn't get swampy. The little zipper pocket is the perfect size for keys or a credit card. The microfiber glasses wipe sewn into the pocket interior is genius, I use it constantly. The longer rear cut means it stays tucked on the bike (no crack showing). The fit is trim without being overly tight looks good both on and off the bike.

The Not-So-Good: The zipper pocket, while useful, can create a slight bulge if you overstuff it. At $60, it's more expensive than basic athletic tops but competitive with other bike-specific jerseys that also have a small pocket.

OVERALL THOUGHTS
Ketl's whole philosophy is about versatile, minimalist gear that works across multiple activities without looking like you're playing dress-up. After 8 months, I can confirm they deliver on that promise. The quality is legitimate, these pieces have held up as good or better than comparable gear from Patagonia, Prana, and bike-specific brands I've tried like Fox.

The pricing is mid-to-upper range, but the versatility means you're getting more value per wear. The Tomfoolery pants especially have replaced like 3-4 pairs of different pants in my closet because they work for so many situations.

If you're someone who bikes, hikes, travels, and wants gear that transitions seamlessly between activities without sacrificing performance, Ketl is worth checking out. They've also got free shipping and returns, which is convenient to figure out what size you are.

Would I buy again? Absolutely. I'm eyeing their Skid Mark shorts and Departed tees next.",1,1762437598.0,MTB,1,0.57,False

So me and my wife moved to this country couple of years ago year and we got a house last year but has it been always like this with the neighbours or it’s just my luck?

It’s a nice residential community but the neighbours here hardly talk to each other..when we just moved in last year I went and introduced myself to all the houses next to me and even gave a gift candle set. But that is all, no talks nothing

I’m an introvert guy still tried to put some effort to make friends and when I see someone outside,  I try to put effort to talk something.. but it’s like Q&A.. I ask them and they answer and the end. I even invited them to come home sometime for a coffee or something.. but they don’t seem to be interested much. We’ve always been quite and never disturbed or caused any issues.

On multiple occasions I see them and just say quick hi to each other but no talks.. it’s not like they’re like that with only me ..I never saw them doing things with other neighbours too..

We thought it’d be a friendly neighbourhood but it feels like we’re just alone. It’d be really good to meet and get to know the brit culture and life as we’re not from here.

Anyone has tips I can try.. shoot

My wife comes home this morning. Usually this is my time to panic clean the house. Not that it's ever really dirty. Just maybe have to throw the few dishes in the dishwasher, make the bed, sweep the floor. Nothing crazy. But also..... it was just sloppy work on my part during this final hour. 

  
This morning....I'm awake. I'm on my second cup of coffee. The only cleaning I've done is sweep the kitchen because I had a friend over last night putting googly eyes all over the place as a prank for my wife. ...and they wore their shoes in. No biggie. 

But I'm so calm this morning. I'm on day 7. I slept great. My house is CLEAN. So damn clean it feels gooooooood. It's calming in and of itself knowing that everything is spotless and organized. 

  
.....except for the laundry. I hate folding laundry. There's only so much the universe can ask of me. hahaha

1opzi8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/northcounty/comments/1opzi8y/local_pen_pal_social_experiment_wingpal/,Local pen pal social experiment (wing-pal),"Hi all, this odd little bird is back. With an idea that hopefully will breathe joy and life to those lonely souls in our local community. I’m done trying to point the finger at what’s wrong with our city, society, neighbors. I want to be an influence of a positive shift. Small as it may be or as big as it may get. I’d like to jumpstart a local pen pal directory(social network). If this small experiment seems like something people enjoy and find fruitful, a website will be created and then an app. With the necessary technology for age verification and moderations.

Why , because I’m lonely , because I don’t know how to properly socialize. I enjoy writing and I enjoy reading, so instead of swiping left or going to a bar I’d like enjoy the pleasure of a conversation, no strings attached, no  expectations . Without judging a person by their appearance , age or gender. The goal would mainly focus on making deep and personal connections, friendships; with people who one day you may be able to meet and then get to know IRL, but before sharing a picture , name or age and especially a phone number and or social media handle with the expectation of meeting the love of your life perhaps you could end up with….a friend or at least someone real with whom you may chat.

So this how it’s going to work: first you create a brand new email. One that may hide your identity as much as possible, this means, no government name, no nicknames or aliases you’ve used or been called both IRL or on the internet, no personal details like your birth year, Example: John1984@gmail.com Once you have the email, you may start typing your email to me at: cupid0@proton.me The title ought to be a small sentence that briefly describes who you are WITHOUT mentioning , your name and or nicknames/aliases , your age , or your gender!

An example may be “I’m a dove, that flies within words”, “ I love to dance, when I’m alone”,  “I like coffee, with my morning rum”, “ I am tired, of feeling lonely”, “my cat is my only friend”, “ the library is my favorite place”. “ I’m a song writer”, “ I’m a very bad driver”….. whatever comes to mind when you think of describing yourself as long as, you don’t reveal your identity, in any way shape or form , the unspoken rule will be before you reveal any of this details first send out 6 emails to the same person and if at that point you feel ready to share those details  you can ask your correspondent , would you like to know my name? I know this will probably be a challenge to most people, but remember , the purpose of this experiment is not to meet a lover , the purpose will be, the enjoyment of conversations with no expectations or strings attached.

The body should contain 9 of your favorite things, from any of this categories, (Example) Favorite songs: Favorite foods: Favorite hobbies:cycling , poetry writing, music production. Favorite books: Don Quijote de La Mancha, The son, diary of an oxygen thief. Favorite movies: cloud atlas , the French dispatch , pulp fiction . Favorite sports: Favorite places: Favorite animals: Favorite plants: Favorite tv shows:

This could be 1 from each category or like me 3 from 3  or 6 and 3. How ever you want to mix them,  just choose 9 of your favorite things, if you have more than 9 add them, just have 9 as a minimum. Categories may be added as per suggestions.

And last but not least a brief letter about  yourself, WITHOUT revealing any personal details . (Excuse the redundancy).

I will serve as a middle man,  I will forward  your email to  any correspondent who may or may not be someone you may be able to enjoy a conversation with.

The only requirements are 18+ ONLY, NO CREEPS! I will do moderation personally until  it becomes unmanageable. Eventually if  this little project takes off I’ll start working on a website + app. For now this is simply an idea, something to keep me busy on my free time, if it doesn’t that’s okay too, just thought I’d write it  into existence in the form of this post.

or when i ask it to write a getter/setter. thats boilerplate. mini could do that for 1/10th the cost

but cursor makes me pick one model for the whole session. so i use claude for EVERYTHING. finding files, writing boilerplate, complex refactoring. all the same expensive model

its like hiring a senior architect to make coffee

why cant tools just auto-switch models. use mini for simple stuff, claude for hard stuff. could probably save 40-50% on costs

but no tool does this. cursor lets you manually switch but thats annoying. i dont want to think about which model to use

It’s just to help you get to know me before you message.

I’m Max and as the title states, I’m looking for a ride or die. Maybe that’s just through being friends, maybe that’s through something deeper? I’m open to that and everything between.
I’m posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I’ve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I’ve lost contact with a lot of folk so I’m trying to build my connections up again.

I’m a pretty perfect split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I’m not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I’m almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I’ve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I’m just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I’m also into creative writing and poetry if there’s anyone else who’s interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I’m 6’0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that’s in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

I don’t ask for a lot in people, but honesty goes a long way. Otherwise just be yourself, however bubbly or serious that may be. If you think we’ll click, don’t sit on the other side of the screen and wonder what could be - find out and tell me a bit about yourself!

I’m happy to chat through Reddit or move to another platform if and when you’re comfortable and I’ve got no issue with sharing pictures. I’m also a pretty open book so if there’s anything that’s caught your eye here that you want to ask about, please do!

Here's what I did to it after checking the parts:
1. Submerged it to 1:1 hot vinegar water for 30 minutes. 
2. Did three blank shots with the same vinegar water.
3. Scrubbed the insides, removing the residues and build up. (As far as my fingers can reach and my tools can scrub off)

We had a lot of really good moments, but also our share of issues. After our first breakup, we ended up getting back together for about two months, but broke up again because I wasn’t sure if he truly wanted or needed me in his life. At times, he made me feel like I wasn’t good enough, and that uncertainty eventually pushed us apart.

Since then, we haven’t spoken much, but recently we started talking again. When we caught up for the first time in a month, he told me he was doing okay but still thinks about things from the past sometimes. I’ve been honest about what’s been going on in my life, and while he’s been kind and offered support, there’s also been this sense of distance — like he cares but doesn’t want to show too much.

We agreed to meet for coffee, and it’ll be the first time seeing each other in person since the breakup. The thing is, I still have feelings for him. Something about him keeps pulling me back, but at the same time, I don’t want to hold him back from finding happiness with someone else if that’s what’s meant for him.

Right now, I just want to be friends and take things slow to really figure out how I feel, but I’m not sure if he’s open to that or if he wants to completely move on.

It's like I see your words everywhere *, whether I see it or not. It’s a collection of ideas that truly reflect who you are. I can't help but feel that I've been talking to you and listening to your words this entire time you've been gone. Why you've decided not to speak to me directly is understandable; our communication broke down a long time ago. That's a wise decision.

As the winter comes upon us and the seasons are changing, I feel a world that no longer is, and it's for the better. I see you in my dreams and in my thoughts in all your glory, and I do believe that you're going to become something far greater than you already are. I can only hope that one day you understand some of the things that happened from a different perspective, but never from the place we were standing then.

I firmly believed that you were the one, and I did say that this would be my one and only chance to be with someone. Unfortunately, I failed. Many people go their whole lives without ever having met 'the one' due to circumstances or life occurrences that got in the way. But we had two long years together—I cherish that. I didn't expect that much of my life to have a privilege such as that: to meet the one.

I think I know now that I'll never be married because I only ever think about you—how you're doing, if you're making it, if you're happy. Maybe one day, when I finally see you happy and complete, then I can see that it's possible for me too. It's just like the struggle that we went through: you showed me that recovery is possible, thriving is possible, and regaining your strength and identity is completely within the realm of possibility. If you, my love, can do it, then so can I.

Perhaps one day I can sit and have a cup of coffee and feel nothing but gratitude—that the pain is gone, and my heart is no longer burdened with our past.

# Competitive and Regulatory Pressures

* **Market Demand**: Some believe that the novelty of Airbnb is wearing off, and people prefer traditional hotels. [""Most people I know would now rather stay at a hotel and have everything, from breakfast to coffee to cleaning, covered than stay in an AirBNB and get hit with unnecessary charges.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1jisakw/comment/mjhmk62/)
* **Regulatory Issues**: Cities are increasingly regulating short-term rentals, which could limit Airbnb's footprint. [""Considering that major cities there’s always a push to get stuff like this banned due to the current housing cost crisis, I wouldn’t count on that stock retaining its value.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jcsbns/comment/mi5gb5n/)

# Investor Sentiment

* **Mixed Feelings**: Some investors are bullish due to Airbnb's strong cash flow and growth potential, while others are bearish due to competitive pressures and regulatory risks. [""I think this company will be a long term winner.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1jisakw/comment/mjs5b2a/) vs. [""I have finally thrown in the towel today after the latest quarterly results and have to accept this was my worst investing decision.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1mjhzoh/is_there_a_stock_worse_than_abnb/)",1,1762436883.0,Options_Beginners,0,1.0,False
1opzd80,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1opzd80/aita_for_not_wanting_to_meet_up_with_a_friend_to/,AITA for not wanting to meet up with a friend to help with the baby?,"So I (f) have a friend (f) who had a baby 9 months ago. We are not that super close, but we became friends around 2 years ago.

We both work seasonal jobs so winter is the time to relax (6 months no days off work). She was pregnant last winter and we were going out for walks and coffees many times. We were playing board games and just had a nice time.

In the summer we didn't have time to meet up, we only saw each other twice a week at work. Yes, she went to work after 2 months, but it is a long story, and not my business. Now the season is over, and at some point she saw my partner and asked him when will he send me to her. He said to text me and ask as it's none of his business. She texted me and asked to meet on a certain day. It turned out that her baby had a doctor's appointment and she needed my help. I did help, but i couldn't help but feel that I was being used, especially after I told her that I am leaving on the 20th of the month and she said that it's a shame because her baby is going to see the doctor again and I won't be able to help.

Today she texted me and asked if we can meet up on Monday. Before I said yes, she texted that she has a hairdresser appointment and I will stay with the baby. I honestly saw red. She doesn't text me to meet up just for coffee, but only when she needs my help. With others she just goes out and that's it. I spoke with my partner and he told me that he told me last year that she is using me, and he doesn't like it. Right now she is alone and I get the need for help, but I can't help but feel that she's just using me. I told her that I have plans and won't be able to meet.

I said that to my other friend and she said that I am the asshole since she is alone and has nobody close. I think she could've asked another person, and now she's with her parents in another town and she could have actually leave the kid with them and go to the hairdresser there.

So AITA?

1opzbf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1opzbf5/unpopular_opinion_just_be_authentic_is_terrible/,"Unpopular opinion: ""Just be authentic"" is terrible advice for founders trying to market their products.","Everyone tells us to ""just be authentic"" on social media to market our products on X/Reddit, but honestly, that advice is kinda useless without the 'how.' What does ""authentic"" even look like when you're trying to explain your SaaS or your latest feature, not your morning coffee?

I kept hearing founders complain about spending hours crafting what they thought were ""authentic"" posts, only for them to get crickets. Or worse, feeling like they're forcing it and sounding like a glorified marketer bot. I spent the last \~3 months talking to over 50 indie hackers, solopreneurs, and early-stage SaaS founders about this specific pain.

Here's my contrarian take, and what I found: The real issue isn't a lack of authenticity. It's a fundamental disconnect between our founder brain (analytical, problem-solving, building mode) and our communication brain (empathetic, storytelling, relatable). We're amazing at identifying obscure pain points and building elegant solutions, but then we switch to corporate speak the moment we try to share our journey or insights.

It's like we forget how to talk like the actual human beings who built the thing, and instead try to sound like a press release. The vulnerability, the struggles, the ""aha!"" moments – those are the things that truly resonate, but they're damn hard to put into words effectively without feeling cheesy or self-promotional.

So, I've been building something I'm calling [LiftMyTxt](http://liftmytxt.com) yeah, the name's still a bit rough, feel free to roast it. It's definitely not another generic AI writer for marketing copy. Think of it more like an AI sparring partner designed specifically for founders. It helps you take your raw thoughts, your internal monologue, your actual project updates, and shape them into genuinely engaging and human posts for X or Reddit, helping you find that founder voice instead of a marketer's one.

Am I completely off base here? Is this even a real problem for you, or am I just building something for my own echo chamber? What's your biggest pain point when trying to write posts that feel authentic and actually get traction?",1,1762436730.0,SaaS,2,1.0,False
1opzbc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1opzbc0/26m_have_a_wife_but_hardly_any_friends_ranting/,"26m, have a wife but hardly any friends. ranting about how hard it is to meet people nowadays","Very often, the only person I hang out with is my wife. Sometimes my in-laws, though I'm not close with them. Then I have a couple friends. I'll refer to them quickly as W, R and K. W is my online friend I've known for over a decade. R is a  coworker I met 6 years ago and K is another online friend I met nearly a decade ago.

Thing is though, R and K rarely talk to me. Which is fine, because when we do talk, it's genuine. W does talk to me nearly every day, but it's more... it's hard to explain, but it's not really conversations. We tend to just spam eachother with random stuff, like stuff we saw in video games recently or whatever. Despite being my longest friend, he's not the first person I go to for a conversation.

And that's fine, because I know they're still my friends. If one of us goes silent for \*too long\*, we check on eachother or even just send a random meme or random thought. It's nice. We remember eachothers' existence. That being said though, I've been wanting people I can talk to, especially during times where my wife is working but I'm not. And it's just... not working out.

I always seem to have to be the person who puts in effort to get to know someone new. I'm always the one typing open-ended replies while getting closed-off replies like ""yeah"" ""lmao"" ""mood"" in response. I get that sometimes there are times where that's about all you can say, but when EVERY reply of theirs is close ended, then yeah. screw that. I'm not asking for a freaking essay response but geez, conversations with people nowadays feels like I'm trying to fly a spaceship through an asteroid field. The open space is my reply, and the asteroids are the closed off replies that I'm trying to avoid so the spaceship (conversation) doesn't ram into one and explode (die off). And if I don't message first, they never do and simply forget I exist.

Almost nobody seems capable of reading anything past two sentences either. I have this one person who seemed interested in me at first (we met on Marvel Rivals) and we were playing together often. We DMed a bit, I joined their server and we got to know eachother a little bit. They seemed genuinely excited to see me hop on and talk to me... and now they just ignore most of what I say. Like I'm not the new shiny thing to them or whatever. They reply to me if I send a meme, but if I send anything beyond a couple sentences they never reply to it (despite replying to other people who sent stuff after). It just feels like a lie, especially since they never message first.

Idk. I know this post is long. But I'm sitting here with a cup of nice coffee, about to play a game, and instead of being immersed in the game I'm just kind of upset once again that I barely have anyone to talk to. And finding new people to talk to is seeming more and more hopeless in today's society. Granted, I'm autistic and socially awkward+shy, so meeting people in person is hard for me.

1opyyba,https://i.redd.it/3aivnjgk0nzf1.jpeg,"For the ""pre-grind and take to the office"" crowd: I've found the perfect jars for a single dose","I used to pre-grind two cups for each day in the office (one regular and one decaf) and put in separate ziploc bags. It worked okay, but it was annoying to dump into the Aeropress without some kind funnel or the scooper. It seemed like a lot of coffee aroma leaked out of the bags, even when I tried double bagging. I tried to re-use the ziploc bags as much as possible but they'd eventually need to be tossed, and it just felt wasteful.

I looked at all different types of containers to replace the ziploc bags, and settled on these tiny jars from Amazon. They fit a single dose perfectly, I've done up to 15g with room to spare. They fit really well in a backpack/work bag, not too wide or bulky to make an awkward fit. They have have surprisingly tight seal as well - I barely smell any coffee when they're sealed up in my bag. They come with different color lids so I can easily differentiate between my regular and decaf grinds. And their best feature, IMO, is that they are the exact size to fit inside the opening of the Aeropress, so there's never any mess when dumping, and a funnel or scooper isn't needed.

  
Highly recommend. Here's a [link to the jars on Amazon](http://amazon.com/dp/B0F7WMT476?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)",18,1762435816.0,AeroPress,0,0.96,False

First job in the UK after relocating my wife and I from the states so she could be with family after spending a decade with mine in our home region post military service.

This job, had everything.  Free coffee at machines, on site food for cheap, access to see and support a high end effort in a niche industry (motorsport racing type company)

Thing is, I was an outside from the start.  First week the US was wrapping the election and I was watching in agony my first week at the job.  My director turns around and asks me about it, I tell them I voted Democrat (which in hindsight I shouldn't have brought up the map or anything, but it was always a thing at every US job I worked before)

Immediately after that the helpdesk manager gets up and comes over, and my boss turns around from their computer as well.

Helpdesk manager, being British so this was extremely odd to hear from them: ""maga""

What? I ask, why would you say that?

He repeats.

Again, I say please don't say that, it's not what it means at all.

They triple down and say I don't know what I'm talking about and then start floating they love the current president.

Again, these are british citizens, saying this to a newly hired US citizen.

I eventually close the map and end the conversation as I usually do with those types and say that does not stand for what my country, my service, or my path to my country means at all, please stop usinging it.

A few days later one of the junior engineers as I jokingly try and join a chat in teams replies ""Drawn and quartered"" as in do that to the American entering the chat.

This came from one of the Brits, or the Scottish junior engineer that refused to show me around as part of onboarding.

This started a pattern of exclusion at this organization, which itself is by definition not British either, but that's a different conversation.

Fast forward to my return from leave after the holiday break and I tell my coworkers that did interact with me we were expecting, finally after twelve years of trying.

Then, I see in chats my work had been deleted and brought to a less detailed level on devices we manage.

The junior engineer was congratulated for doing so.

When I asked why they deleted the work I had spent time on doing the right way every other org I had done at for nearly twenty years across multiple industries I was told ""we don't care, we don't do that here""

So, you don't document end to end connections to a definitive detail so there's no vagueness about what a thing is doing?

They changed topics.

I then bring up the lack of onboarding training to use their systems correctly, the lack of introduction with stakeholders in the org, and the fact they were dismissing my security and other concerns when the org had clearly been through something in the past and clearly hadn't learned its lesson.

Then I brought up a staff member on helpdesk clearly being direct bullied by a another less senior staff member in humiliatong fashion amongst at least a dozen members over three to four different offices due to an open seating design.

Not just our shop, and it was over something that they shouldn't have done that at all.

Again told "" you don't know them, they are friends""

So screaming at a friend, yelling to the point it could cause that person PTSD is between friends? Right.

The cold shoulders, the emails from my manager or my director to facilities staff questioning my experienced actions around the facility ""I don't know why he's doing that""

I mean an unlocked door backing to a   wheat field with access to key business assets seem pretty dumb for a ""high end tech company""

Or the fact staff repeatedly kept entering a room with an automatic means to end life of staff if it triggers for any reason with the safeties not enabled.

Yeah, I'm the problem.

So now, after wrapping with my council I'm certain the team has a hard fall coming, and since I won't be able to be made whole I can only hope their high risk incompetence and toxic behavior does them in.

No level of documentation, or preparation can make someone follow safety rules or be less toxic.

I knew Airmen that drove drunk and dodged hitting sheep while on duty, I know others that trashed equipment because a supervisor was being an asshole or their spouse back home was causing problems while deployed.

I know when a team is toxic and there's no fixing it until leadership is changed, and if the top of the chain was corrupt or toxic, you best bet the entire tree is based on what I've experienced to date.

But take this post as a lesson, sometimes the assholes do win, and when they do, all you can do is keep your notes and documentation.  When the law comes looking then, then you can hope for another chance of being made whole, but until then try and make peace.  I know it's hard, I'm still fighting the urge to protest the org publicly, or send notes to reporters, notes I obtained legally.

It really went out of control in the last 3 years, to where I was hiding alcohol from my wife and drinking in my car parked outside my house and then just slamming mints or coffee before going in. I’ve had enough of it, mostly becaise now my liver hurts, any time I drink I get bad stomach pains, and it’s eating my finances alive. 20 years ago I was in the best shape of my life, a gym rat, and generally optimistic. It’s hard to keep awake now without having a nonstop craving for liquor (I don’t know if it’s better or worse I cut out beer). I was inspired this time to quit when my boss asked me why my hands were shaking at work- I just said that I had taken my Adderal and it causes that (it does, but I hadn’t taken it yet). I’m going to double down on sobriety this time- I’m committing to meditation 5x weekly minimum, 2-3 days at Recovery Dharma, working out 4x a week minimum once I have 3 days of sobriety, and use this post to keep track of my progress. I’ll edit it weekly at least to keep on track. If any of that is against the rules, please let me know. 
So… day 1. Mildly anxious, minimal shaky hands, upset stomach, but thankfully no retching (one thing that also convinced me to quit is I was tired of retching so hard I would have a headache that would only go away after drinking). I’m off work today so mostly will be looking for better jobs and probably getting out in nature for a while. Thanks for reading, all. ",5,1762435013.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

This is going to sound like paranoid bullshit but I need someone else to know before it's too late.

Two months ago I noticed this man at the grocery store. Nothing special about him. Middle aged, brown hair, forgettable face, tan jacket. He was buying milk. I only noticed him because he was humming this tune I couldn't place, something that sounded like a lullaby played backwards.

A week later, same man at the DMV. Same tan jacket. Same humming. He sat three chairs away from me, never looked in my direction, just hummed that weird reversed melody while staring at his number slip.

Then I saw him at the park. The library. The coffee shop. Always peripheral. Always humming. Never acknowledging me.

I started taking photos. That's when things got fucked up.

In every photo, he's looking directly at the camera. Direct eye contact. Even when I took them secretly, even when he was facing the other way when I clicked the button. In the photo, those eyes are always locked on mine. Smiling this small, knowing smile.

But here's the thing that made me lose my shit: I went back through old photos on my phone. Birthday parties, vacation shots, random pictures from years ago. He's in them. Way in the background, usually just a blur, but it's him. That tan jacket. Always facing the camera.

He's in a photo from my college graduation six years ago.

He's in the background of my sister's wedding photos from 2019.

He's in a selfie I took at a concert in 2017, standing in the crowd behind me.

Same man. Same jacket. Same dead stare at the camera.

I showed my roommate Jessica the photos. She looked at me like I was insane. ""What man? These are just normal pictures.""

I pointed right at him in the grocery store photo. ""Right there. Tan jacket. By the milk.""

""That's just an empty aisle,"" she said.

But I can see him. Clear as day. Getting closer in each photo.

I stopped leaving my apartment. Ordered everything online. Worked from home. Covered all my mirrors because I kept catching glimpses of tan in the reflection behind me.

Then last night I was scrolling through Instagram and saw my friend's story from a bar. There he was, sitting in a booth in the background. But this time he wasn't looking at the camera.

He was holding up a piece of paper.

I zoomed in until the pixels went blurry but I could make out what it said:

""Stop looking for me or I'll have to stop pretending you can't see me.""

I immediately called my friend. ""Who was that guy in the booth behind you? Tan jacket?""

""What guy? I was there alone. That booth was empty all night.""

I've been going through every photo I can find. He's in ALL of them. Every single photo I'm in or have taken for the past twenty years. Sometimes close, sometimes far, but always there. And in the recent ones, he's not just watching anymore.

He's getting closer.

Three days ago: Standing directly behind me at the coffee shop.

Two days ago: Sitting at the next table at a restaurant in my friend's photo.

Yesterday: Standing right beside me in my sister's mirror selfie, close enough to touch.

Today I found a photo on my phone I didn't take. It's me sleeping in my bed last night. Taken from inside my room. He's not in the photo.

Because he's the one taking it.

I'm writing this from my bathroom. It's the only room without windows and I've pushed the dresser against the door. I can hear humming from the other side. That backwards lullaby. It's been going for three hours now.

I just checked my phone. There's another photo I didn't take. It's me in this bathroom, typing this post. The angle is impossible. It's taken from inside the wall.

The humming stopped.

Now there's breathing.

It's coming from inside the walls. All around me. Like the whole room is inhaling and exhaling.

I just realized something. In every photo where he appears, I'm not looking at the camera. I'm looking slightly to the left. Like I'm looking at something just out of frame. And my expression...

I look terrified.

I look like I'm screaming.

But in my memory of those moments, I was smiling. Having fun. Normal.

Which memories are real? The ones where I was happy and never saw him? Or the ones the photos show, where I was always terrified and he was always there?

My phone just buzzed. New photo.

It's me in the bathroom right now, looking at my phone. But in the photo, I'm not alone. The room is packed with people. All wearing tan jackets. All with that same forgettable face. Dozens of them, pressed against each other, filling every inch of space around me.

They're all smiling.

I'm checking the room. I'm alone. I can see I'm alone.

But I can feel breathing on my neck.

The mirror is fogging up in spots. Lots of spots. Like multiple people breathing on it from the other side.

Words are forming in the condensation.

""We've always been here.""

""You just started seeing.""

""Stop seeing.""

""Or join us.""

My phone keeps taking photos by itself. In each one, there are more of them. They're so crowded now they're overlapping, existing in the same space, faces blending into each other.

In the last photo, I'm wearing a tan jacket.

I don't own a tan jacket.

I just looked down.

I'm wearing a tan jacket.

When did I put this on?

The humming is coming from my own throat now. I can't stop it. That backwards lullaby. I know the words now. I've always known the words.

We've always been here.

In every photo.

In every reflection.

In every peripheral glance you've dismissed.

We're in your photos too.

Check them.

Look for the tan jackets.

We're waiting for you to see us.

Or waiting for you to join us.

Either way.

We're patient.

We've always been patient.

I just took a selfie. I can't tell which one is me anymore.

We're all smiling the same smile.

Humming the same song.

Waiting for you to notice us.

Check your photos.

So I’m planning on making my friend a Madagascar table in resin as a joke. (This is based off a joke that my friend has so many copy’s of the Madagascar movie that we make him a coffee table out of them) So I’d be encasing either the DVDs themselves or the cases or them *in* the cases.

 I’m worried about both being warped and melted in the resin. I know I can do small layers, but would that be enough? What’s the best course of action? I found a rectangular silicone mold on Walmart, I can be the resin, and I can get eighteen Madagascar DVDs. The mold I have in mind would be 23.6in by 11.3in (with a max of 3.93in in height) according to Walmart. 

Would it be possible to make the table with the DVDs, their cases or both? (I definitely thought about using any DVDs I won’t use to make coasters, but don’t have a game plan still) And if it’s possible to encase them in resin, what’s the best way possible to make it work? I’m newer to resin and only have made smaller pieces such as keychains. The largest project I’ve done are flower encased paperweights. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Their neighbors have like seven or eight cows (I forget the exact number). They come up to the fence for me and my mom, and I love petting them if they let me. I tend to try to ask them if I can pet them. I love talking to them like I'd talk to humans (I view them as persons, after all). Their owners keep very bad care of them in the realm of food and grooming, and I talk to the cows about that. As weird as this might sound to my family, I feel as if the cows understand me. We try to feed the cows whatever scraps of fruits and vegetables we have. It's not much, but yeah. I love making a moo sound, and seeing them all run to the fence.

I used to hate spiders, but now I try to turn a blind eye to the ones I see that aren't venomous. Spiders do still scare me though. There are random insects that get in the house, and I try to catch them and put them outside (Unless they're gnats. They were getting on the food and in the coffee-maker. Also earwigs and scorpions. I don't enjoy killing them, and I feel bad about it, but I'm scared of them and my family hates them, so I feel like I have to. The last time I killed an earwig was months ago, in the early summer, so maybe I won't do that next year.). I like to reassure them that I won't hurt them. I even let what I think was a metallic, greenish-blue colored beetle crawl on my hand. I've released three crickets I think, and just let two others vibe in the house. My grandparents don't really care that they get inside lol. I got a cricket to hop outside of the garage yesterday by moving my foot close to it. I spoke to it and said how I didn't want it to get trapped in the garage.

I talk to the bunny that my mom loves to feed in the front yard at her house, and I want to say that I talked to butterflies and dragonflies, and maybe moths a few months ago near flowers at my grandparents' house. I released what was either a millipede or centipede that somehow got in the house too, and I think I was telling it I wasn't going to hurt it.

Also, for those of you who know what june bugs are, I try to flip them right-side up or put them on grass when I can.

I’m healthy, grounded, and past the stage of pretending to be someone I’m not.

I’m masculine but calm. I listen. I fix what breaks. I can cook, build, or repair anything I own. I’m loyal, self-aware, and not here to be anyone’s ATM, therapist, or savior.

⸻

What I’m Looking For

A living apart together (LAT) relationship. We each keep our own homes and lives. We see each other once or twice a week, spend some weekends together, travel a few times a year, and enjoy real connection without the burnout that comes from living on top of each other.

I’m looking for a partner, not a project. Affectionate, grounded, emotionally intelligent, and feminine, someone who wants love, sex, laughter, and peace, not codependency or chaos.

⸻

You

You’ve built a life you actually live. You’re emotionally stable, take care of yourself physically, and know how to self-regulate when life gets rough. You don’t need constant attention, but you value consistency and depth when we’re together.

You still flirt, still laugh, still like to touch and be touched. You’re open-minded, kind, confident, and have enough independence to appreciate another independent person.

⸻

What We’d Be Like

Dinner out or a quiet night in.
A weekend at the beach or a day on the boat. Sex that’s passionate because it’s not routine. Time apart that makes time together mean something. We’d communicate like adults, show up when we say we will, and protect each other’s peace.

⸻

Hard No’s
   •   Entitlement
   •   Financial dependence
   •   Emotional volatility
   •   Jealousy, manipulation, or games
   •   “Spoil me” energy
   •   Religious extremism or moral policing

⸻

If you read this and thought finally, something real, send a message.
Tell me what LAT means to you, where you live, and what you’re looking for. FYI, LAT is new to me. Include a photo if you want. If there’s a spark, we’ll meet for a walk, coffee, or a drink by the water.

I am 76 hours in 168 hours of fast i.e. 7 days. I have been doing (inconsistently) 18 hours, OMAD fasts, and did a 3 day fast last month.

Currently I am on a 7 day water only fast, and so far so good. I did have dizziness on the 2nd day, but 3rd day was much better, and today too is not too bad wrt dizziness or hunger pangs. I am happy with how my body is reacting.

I started at 123.20 KGs, and I am at 118.35 KGs right now, which is a good change of almost 5 KGs in less than 4 days (water weight I am sure).

I will most definitely continue till 7 days, but I was contemplating, I can stretch it to 10 days, provided I can cut some slack, and have something like a diet coke / coconut water to keep me going for another 3 days? (I am not into tea / coffee)

Beyond 7 days, my goal won't be autophagy, but only weight loss. Having diet coke or coconut water for another 3 days would also result in weight loss right? I mean instead of food, this is of course much lesser calories.

Can the members here suggest if okay?

My goal is to to lose 8-9 KGs if possible on this 10 day fast (already down 5 KGs), then refeed for 3 days, then a 5 day fast again before an event on 24th.

I want to end up below 110 KGs before the event on 24th.",1,1762434148.0,fasting,10,1.0,False

a small step for humankind, but a big one for me.  
I spent an entire day yesterday trying to get the **Sonoff MINIR4M** running. Spoiler: no luck.

My goal was simple:  
I wanted to make my existing wall switches **smart**, not by cutting the power to the lights, but by detecting the **switch position change** and using that as a trigger for automations. So whenever I flip the switch, my **Philips Hue ceiling lights** should turn on / off, *without* losing power, allowing me to still control them via **Apple HomeKit**, **Alexa**, etc.

Here’s what I learned the hard way:  
The **Sonoff Mini Extreme** is essentially a relay for making **non-smart devices smart** it cuts and restores power remotely. Pretty cool, just not for what I needed. I might repurpose mine for dumb appliances like a kettle or coffee machine, where that behavior actually makes sense.

These devices usually offer a **“Detach Mode”**, which decouples the switch from the relay. Unfortunately, on the **MINIR4M**, this mode is only available via **eWeLink**, and when connected to **Home Assistant**, you don’t get the switch state reported back. So forget this one for now.

Enter the **ZBMINIR2** and suddenly, the game changes.  
The Zigbee integration via **ZHA** is smooth, and you immediately get access to **Detach Mode**. It took some troubleshooting (and a lot of patience with Google), but it works beautifully once set up.

Here’s what worked for me:

* After pairing, **enable Detach Mode**.
* **Important:** immediately hit **Reconfigure**.
* Set **Edge Trigger** (I still don’t fully understand it, but it works).
* **Reconfigure again!**
* Under **Startup Behavior**, choose “Off” — otherwise, HA can lose control.

If you skip reconfiguring after each step, Home Assistant will soon show the device as *unavailable*, and the relay starts blinking, forcing a full re-pair. That’s why I enabled **Turbo Mode** as well.

After that, I copied the **binary\_sensor.sonoff\_zbminir2\_opening** event into **Switch Manager (HACS)** and linked it to a Shelly relay to **toggle my bathroom lights ON/OFF**.

Result:  
I finally achieved what I was aiming for turning **dumb switches into smart ones**, while still being able to cut power when needed.

I’ll be testing this setup for a few days before embedding everything back into the wall and ordering more units. One small thing still bothers me though:  
On the **Zigbee map**, the relay doesn’t show a connection line to my other devices. It *should* act as a **router**, so I’m wondering if that’s an issue or just a visual quirk.

Would love to hear if anyone experienced the same and if I should worry about it or just let it be.

Cheers

We lived together for one and even talked about moving away together and planned for marriage. This fall, things just… started falling apart. She got busier, I felt more and more like I was the only one trying.

Back in September, I told her I felt neglected and like it was one-sided. She said she was working seven days a week, completely burnt out, and thought I was just taking space. We met for coffee, talked a bit, but nothing really changed.

On October 2nd, I sent a long message basically saying, “I love you, but I’m unhappy and tired of feeling alone in this.” She replied saying she was “trying baby, I really am, but I feel stretched thin and burnt out… it breaks my heart you feel like you’re in this alone, but I don’t know what else I can do right now.” That ended up being the last message she ever sent me.

I didn’t respond for a week because I didn’t know what to say. Then I texted saying I’d taken some time to think and would like to meet up and talk. The next day was her birthday, so I sent a simple “Wishing you a happy birthday.” She never replied to either. Just left on delivered.

A day later I took down our posts and removed our shared locations. By Oct 20th, she unfollowed me and removed me as a follower, but a few hours later opened that last text from me again, as it said “read”.

In late October my grandma passed away — I didn’t tell her. Now it’s early November and she’s still watching my siblings’ stories from her ig account, even though she unfollowed me on her main. I made my own Instagram public and noticed what might be views from her. My highlights are sayings I’m getting views from a non-follower.

We never actually broke up in person or even said “it’s over.” She just went ghost... After four years together, it’s weird to have no closure and still see traces of her quietly checking in. I’ve been trying to detach and move on, but part of me keeps wondering what her silence and those story views really mean. Anyone have thoughts?",1,1762434116.0,u_Rich-Assist8983,0,1.0,False

We are both openly gay so I found it alright to be a bit playfull and flirty with her. Now we would usualy hang out all together but she also started asking me to hang out alone with her. We would get coffee and she would show me around the town, we would go to the movies and she even helped me study ( I'm 20 and on second year and she's 24 on her last year).

We did kiss few times and she calls me pretty on the daily, she also makes sure to walk me to my classes and she brings me coffee every morning. We do hang out in our rooms but we never got further from making out, as I don't rush with that and she also was really respectfull and never pushed anything. 

Now I'm type off girl that keeps my private life to myself mostly, I don't have a need to share it with others until I'm really sure into something. So my roomate asked me whats happening between us two, and I said that nothing is happening and she said to be carefull because even too they are friends she has to tell me that girl I'm seeing is a player. And I don't really know what to think about it, I didn't get huge player vibes off of her, but I also don't think she has a lover girl vibe.

Sunshine act compliance has historically been our weakest area, lots of mistakes and oversights. Tried three different approaches to training over the past two years. Annual compliance webinar was boring PowerPoint with legal team talking for 90 minutes, everyone multitasking during the Zoom call. Retention was terrible and same mistakes kept happening. Written guidelines and self-study didn't work either. Created a 40 page compliance manual and made it required reading. Nobody read it. Mistakes continued.

What finally worked was practical scenario based training. Broke it into 30-minute monthly sessions focused on specific situations reps actually encounter. Physician asks you to grab coffee, is that reportable? Speaker dinner runs over budget, what do you do? That kind of thing. Also changed our payment tools to ones that make compliance automatic. We evaluated several options and ended up implementing hoppier for meals and events, medcompli for consulting and advisory boards. When the tools prevent mistakes from happening, you need less training. Our sunshine act reporting errors dropped by about 70%. Reps say they feel more confident about what's allowed vs not allowed.

Lesson here is that training only works if it's relevant to real situations people face. And honestly, making compliance easy through better processes is more effective than trying to train people to work with broken processes.

I ordered 10lbs of https://shop.thetaridgecoffee.com/products/ethiopian-harrar?variant=29133544521 which according to their website was upgraded from grade 4 to grade 1 for this batch. Sounds great. 

This has been hands down the most disappointing roasting experience in my three years of doing this. I have changed zero variables in my roasting routine for a “similar” guji bean so results should have been somewhat similar to great coffees I’ve roasted just before roasting this. 

I’m three 1 lb batches in and all of them have been grassy and absolute trash. The laughing point was when I had a literal popcorn kernel in with my third batch. The beans themselves are all over the map in size and density, odd shapes and defects. Lots of Quakers and some scorched beans as well. 

Absolutely zero chance this was actually grade 1 or at least what I’ve got is not. I was attracted to Theta Ridge because of their prices (aren’t we all feeling it) but I don’t think I trust buying anything with them after this first experience with beans from them.

Using a fluid bed roaster and by all accounts from artisan profiles it should have been at least passable coffee and my wife won’t even drink it. So I’m choking down what I’ve got roasted and pitching the rest. More stuff on the way from Sweet Maria’s. 

Anyone else have this experience with Theta Ridge beans?

Someone who understands that intimacy isn’t always loud or rushed, sometimes it’s quiet.

as if the world might hand you back to me
in a borrowed face or familiar laugh.
Every crowd is an ocean,
and I sift through waves like a sailor who forgot land exists,
hoping one tide might return what another stole.
Your absence is a lighthouse stuck on dawn,
forever searching, forever late.

Sometimes I catch a profile in passing
and my heart leaps like a startled deer,
fragile and foolish,
believing for a heartbeat that miracles still happen.
Hope crawls up my ribs like ivy 
beautiful, suffocating 
clinging to walls that should have fallen by now.
I hate that I still bloom for ghosts.

I chase echoes more than people,
leaning toward footsteps that sound almost right,
eyes stinging at the sight of someone
holding their coffee the way you did 
as if the world might spill if they breathed too quickly.
A laugh that rises soft and falls gentle
turns the universe cruel again.
You were gravity disguised as comfort,
and now I float,
untethered,
aching for weight.

Do you ever search too?
Or have you learned to walk through crowds
without breaking?
I wonder if you ever hear a voice like mine
and feel time stutter,
if you ever mistake a memory for a future
the way I do 
naive as a child trying to sew a sky back together
with broken light.

The truth is, I don’t only miss you 
I miss the self who believed your hands were home.
I miss being soft without fear,
miss loving without armor,
miss trusting the world to keep what I gave it.
Now I love like holding glass underwater,
trying to drown the sharpness,
cutting myself anyway.

Strangers don’t know the way grief lives in my spine,
how my heartbeat is a quiet apology,
how every beautiful thing carries your name
like a secret it never asked to keep.
The world keeps moving
but I stay stitched to the doorway where you left,
a shadow with lungs,
breathing out versions of you that never return.

Still, I look 
not to find you,
but because I’m terrified of the day I won’t.
Of the morning when a face is just a face,
and no voice feels like salvation.
Losing you hurt,
but forgetting you would be ruin.

So I search 
gentle, foolish, faithful 
like a violin remembering hands that adored it,
like rain remembering the cloud it fell from,
like love refusing to accept its own death.

Maybe that’s all grief is 
the art of holding empty space
as if it were still warm,
still breathing,
still yours.

“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭29:11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

And God does have a plan for you.
God does want to bless you.
God does want to give you hope and a future. 

But, we should also pay attention to the original context …

In this case, God was speaking through the prophet Jeremiah to the people of Judah—people who’d recently been exiled to Babylon for 70 years. 

The Jewish people were banished to a foreign land because of their insatiable appetite for sin. In fact, for 23 years Jeremiah had been warning them to stop rebelling against God or prepare to face the consequences.

God is patient, but He is also just. 

In other words, the Jews were sent to timeout. And as you can read in the preceding chapters, God made a case against His beloved people …

They’d exploited foreigners, orphans, and widows. They’d denied the rights of the poor. They’d refused to stand up for truth or obey God’s instructions. They’d murdered the innocent and committed adultery. They’d rejoiced in doing evil and their lives were ruled by greed. They’d even built pagan shrines, sacrificing their sons and daughters in the fires. It was a dark time. And yet, somehow, God’s mercy always extends to the darkest places on earth.

That’s why, just a few verses later, God said they could seek Him and find Him, and He would bring them back from captivity (Jeremiah‬ ‭29:13‬-14).

That’s why he encouraged them—while in exile—to build houses, plant gardens, get married, have babies, and work for the peace and prosperity of their temporary home (Jeremiah 29:5-7).

He wanted them to know: He hadn’t forgotten them. He still wanted good for them. He still had plans to restore them.

God is serious about sin, but He’s just as passionate about redemption.

Though Jeremiah 29:11 was meant for a specific people at a specific time, God’s heart for the restoration of broken people is generationally timeless. 

Even when we feel stuck in the process, God still has a plan.

Would you like to learn Finnish by chatting with someone? Are you from Japan?

I have been learning Japanese using Duolingo, but I have noticed that I might learn better just by using Japanese language. I am a native finnish speaker with a good and mostly clear pronounciation (Southern finland accent) and my English is not that bad either.

My plan is to find someone who is native Japanese, who could have a live chats with me (and my wife perhaps) every now and then, to help each other to break the language barrier and start using the foreign language even that we are not that familiar with it yet.

Interested? PM me and lets find out if we can find a common path! Please - have some effort in PM and introduce yourself a pit. What is your goal to learn Finnish, how far are you on your learning path, what kind of subjects you would like discuss and how often you would like to have a chat (Teams, Zoom, Google Chat).

I can start:  
I am generally interested of Japanese language and we are planning a trip to Japan next year. I haven't been this intersted of learning anything since my first computer about 35 years ago! I have been using Duolingo about 3 months by now and simultanously I have signed into two separate on-prem Japanese learning sessions. I can talk about almost anything in Finnish: Cars, american cars, horses, painting, miniatyres and board games, coffee, drinking coffee, making coffee, watching while someone is making coffee...

I’m not gonna dress this up like those fancy posts with ten emojis or deep advice threads. Just writing because maybe someone out there will read and nod, or maybe just scroll past. Whatever.Been using dating apps - you name it, swiped, matched, unmatched, all the circus. First week was kinda fun, I’ll be honest. Little dopamine pops when a match happened, small hopes, coffee plans in my head already. But then it’s all math, right? Swipe left, swipe right, conversations that start with “hey” and die before second reply, or just “hi, hmu.” After like, dozens of chats, I’ve met only two people in real life — both were sweet, but both looked at me like, “You’re nice but nah,” and left. Fair enough, not blaming anyone. But like, it just made me even more in my own shell.

One match ghosted me after we made a plan for coffee (I had actually shaved, and let me tell you, I hate shaving for anyone). Another match, we chatted for days, then she told me, “I’m not really looking for anything.” So why are you here? Is it just for attention? Or am I missing something? Sometimes I wonder if it’s me being too needy, or too honest, or maybe just boring.

So yeah, loneliness sucks. Some nights I just stare at the ceiling, phone in hand, wanting someone to message, but the notifications are from apps I don’t even care about like cab fare and cricket scores. Not sex, by the way - I mean, sure, that’s part of it, but mostly just wanting someone who texts first, or asks if I reached home safe. 

Tried taking walks, meeting friends (who all seem to be in couple-land now), signed up for gym, tried that whole “be your best self and love will follow” thing. It’s not magic. If it’s out there for me, great, but apps don’t really help. Most days it’s just another scroll, a message sent, a message not replied. I kinda feel like a vending machine, you press a button and wait for something good, but usually get an empty slot.

Anyway, if anyone reads this - just, thanks for listening. I know I’ll try again next week, uninstall, reinstall, maybe I’ll get lucky or maybe I’ll end up writing another sad post. For now, just wanted to say… if you feel the same, you’re not alone. Apps suck. Real life is messier, but sometimes real.

Some nights, being single feels like sitting in an empty train carriage after the last stop - just the slow hum of regret and longing. For every girl who scrolls and feels invisible, for every guy who tries but ends up talking to himself or the ceiling, knows this: it’s not just you. Sometimes we all just want someone to ask if we ate, or hear how bad the day was, or just say “good night” and mean it. Under all the swipes and missed chances, maybe we’re a million little hearts waiting for one person to notice. If you’re out there feeling the same ache - reach out, even if it’s just for a sad meme or a quiet hello. Maybe this DM is the first step out of loneliness.",9,1762433359.0,ThirtiesIndia,3,0.91,False

You wake up, you work. You come home, you’re too tired to live. Repeat. Your “life” is squeezed into a couple hours at night and maybe one rushed weekend day. If you’re lucky you get one or two weeks of vacation a year and somehow that’s seen as generous. Two weeks. Out of 52. To rest, exist, see family, travel, breathe. And people are scared to even take those days because “it looks bad.”

Then there’s the money situation. People working full-time still can’t survive, so they pick up second and third jobs like it’s a normal solution instead of a massive red flag that the system is broken. You have folks hustling from 7am to midnight across multiple jobs and still stressing over rent, food, basic bills. That is not ambition. That is desperation.

On top of that, you’re forced into paying for a billion things that are either:

Mandatory or Scare-marketed as mandatory.

Health insurance, dental, car insurance, renter’s insurance, phone insurance, pet insurance, extended warranties, subscriptions for everything. Half of it doesn’t even exist, or isn’t remotely as predatory/insane, in other countries. You’re bled dry before you even touch your own paycheck.

And people just…accept it.

No real mass strikes. No shutting things down. No “we’re not doing this until things change.” Just individual burnout on repeat. People rant online, then wake up at 5am for a job that doesn’t pay enough to live in the city it’s in. Instead of saying:

“One job should be enough to live like a human being,”

we say:

“Guess I need a side hustle.”

It’s wild. Instead of demanding a system where a normal job covers rent, food, healthcare, and a bit of dignity, we normalize modern slavery with WiFi and iced coffee.

Meanwhile:

There’s a shortage of decent jobs.

Tons of graduates and engineers are unemployed or underpaid.

Prices are insane (housing, groceries, utilities, all disrespectful at this point).

College tuition is obscene, people start their adult life tens of thousands in debt for a piece of paper that doesn’t even guarantee a job.

And this is just the surface. Everyone has horror stories: medical bills, rent hikes, car payments, credit card interest, “surprise” fees, layoffs. But where is the collective line in the sand?

Why are we okay with this?

Why aren’t there constant strikes? Why aren’t people shutting down cities? Why is everyone so scared to demand a basic, respectful life?

We shouldn’t have to kill ourselves with 60–80 hour weeks just to exist. We shouldn’t have to gamble on GoFundMe instead of having healthcare. We shouldn’t feel guilty for resting. We shouldn’t be grateful for crumbs.

Why should we accept this? Why is this considered normal?

Why don’t we fight for a change?

I’m not gonna dress this up like those fancy posts with ten emojis or deep advice threads. Just writing because maybe someone out there will read and nod, or maybe just scroll past. Whatever.Been using dating apps - you name it, swiped, matched, unmatched, all the circus. First week was kinda fun, I’ll be honest. Little dopamine pops when a match happened, small hopes, coffee plans in my head already. But then it’s all math, right? Swipe left, swipe right, conversations that start with “hey” and die before second reply, or just “hi, hmu.” After like, dozens of chats, I’ve met only two people in real life — both were sweet, but both looked at me like, “You’re nice but nah,” and left. Fair enough, not blaming anyone. But like, it just made me even more in my own shell.

One match ghosted me after we made a plan for coffee (I had actually shaved, and let me tell you, I hate shaving for anyone). Another match, we chatted for days, then she told me, “I’m not really looking for anything.” So why are you here? Is it just for attention? Or am I missing something? Sometimes I wonder if it’s me being too needy, or too honest, or maybe just boring.

So yeah, loneliness sucks. Some nights I just stare at the ceiling, phone in hand, wanting someone to message, but the notifications are from apps I don’t even care about like cab fare and cricket scores. Not sex, by the way - I mean, sure, that’s part of it, but mostly just wanting someone who texts first, or asks if I reached home safe. 

Tried taking walks, meeting friends (who all seem to be in couple-land now), signed up for gym, tried that whole “be your best self and love will follow” thing. It’s not magic. If it’s out there for me, great, but apps don’t really help. Most days it’s just another scroll, a message sent, a message not replied. I kinda feel like a vending machine, you press a button and wait for something good, but usually get an empty slot.

Anyway, if anyone reads this - just, thanks for listening. I know I’ll try again next week, uninstall, reinstall, maybe I’ll get lucky or maybe I’ll end up writing another sad post. For now, just wanted to say… if you feel the same, you’re not alone. Apps suck. Real life is messier, but sometimes real.

Some nights, being single feels like sitting in an empty train carriage after the last stop - just the slow hum of regret and longing. For every girl who scrolls and feels invisible, for every guy who tries but ends up talking to himself or the ceiling, knows this: it’s not just you. Sometimes we all just want someone to ask if we ate, or hear how bad the day was, or just say “good night” and mean it. Under all the swipes and missed chances, maybe we’re a million little hearts waiting for one person to notice. If you’re out there feeling the same ache - reach out, even if it’s just for a sad meme or a quiet hello. Maybe this DM is the first step out of loneliness.",1,1762433256.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False

I’m looking for someone who can talk about books, music, the meaning of life—or why McDonald’s Sprite tastes like urine, then fall into silence that isn’t awkward, but electric. The kind where hands are almost touching on the table… but not yet. *Not yet.*

You don’t need to be flawless, just real. Curious enough to explore, honest enough to stay. The kind of person who can laugh between kisses and fall silent when the moment turns soft. Someone who knows how to hold a gaze long enough for the air to change… when eyes speak louder than lips.

Someone who understands that intimacy isn’t always loud or rushed, sometimes it’s quiet. It’s a breath shared between two people, a hand slowly finding its way to skin, a whisper that never makes a sound. It’s the kind of silence that feels like a body leaning closer, like a secret traced on the edge of a smile.

I didn’t realize how much I had filled every quiet moment, checking emails while waiting, scrolling while the coffee brewed, listening to something during every walk. I called it “being efficient,” but what I’d really lost was the ability to *be still.*

That realization led me to what I now call intentional transitions, the small pauses that help you close one moment before stepping into the next.

Here are five transitions that changed everything for me:

🌿 The Morning Transition — Begin the day without input. Just breathe and arrive in your body before the noise starts.  
🌿 Transition Rituals — Mark the end of one thing and the start of another (washing your hands, lighting a candle, taking three breaths).  
🌿 Pauses in Conversation — Let silence exist. It deepens connection and slows your nervous system.  
🌿 Unscheduled Time — Leave open space in your day — that’s where your nervous system rests and creativity returns.  
🌿 Turn Off Notifications — Protect your peace by deciding when you respond, instead of reacting to every ping.

Transitions don’t slow you down; they help you move through life with more presence, clarity, and calm.

It’s about 730AM in the morning. Last night, was very difficult. I had a breakdown around 930PM. I must have fallen asleep just past 10:30PM. Woke up at around 1:30AM. Tossing and turning, with a great deal of anxiety and panic. Eventually, fell asleep. Woke up around 6AM. And again had a bit of a breakdown while laying in bed.

Eventually, forced myself up, to shower and get to work. Just had a light meal at work and my morning coffee.

This isn’t getting any better. It’s only getting worse. I fear the days ahead. I also keep thinking one’s mind and physical body can only endure so much pain. Mental breakdowns every few hours, racing thoughts. All of this being constant, almost becomes the norm. And it can’t be good for the body.

I’ve tried therapy. And most therapists I find are quite useless. However, I know it’s about finding the right one. I think I will switch therapists.

I have yet again, another long day ahead. With deadlines, meetings and having to meet people. It’s next to impossible to smile.

My friends, check up on me But I don’t want to keep singing the same song to them. It’s been 14 days now, and I am sure they must also be getting tired of hearing this. How will they and I continue to do this for however long it will take.

Checking out the WisdomTree Coffee 3x Daily Leveraged USD ETF (3CFF.L) on Trade Republic. It tracks 3x the daily moves of coffee futures – big gains if prices rise, but risky.

Over 5 years? Started at **€7.30** in Nov 2020. That's a **248%** jump, thanks to droughts, demand spikes, and 3x leverage boosting it.

Quick chart:
- 2020: €7-9
- 2021: Hit €15 on demand boom
- 2022: Dropped to €10s
- 2023-25: Climbed to €20s, +40% YTD

Just wanted to drop in and wish everyone a happy Programmers' Day! For those who don't know, today (10/24) is special because 1024 = 2\^10, which has special significance to us binary-thinking folks.

I'm curious - how are you all celebrating today? Anyone getting any special perks at work or planning something fun with colleagues? My team is doing a small virtual gathering with some coding challenges and prizes.

Looking back over the past year, I'm amazed at how much our field continues to evolve. From AI advancements to new frameworks popping up seemingly every week, it's both exciting and sometimes overwhelming to keep up!

What's been your biggest technical achievement this year? Or what new skill are you most proud of learning? For me, it's finally getting comfortable with \[your achievement here\].

Anyway, just wanted to acknowledge this ""holiday"" with people who understand why 1024 is worth celebrating. Here's to all the late nights debugging, the satisfaction of solving complex problems, and the endless cups of coffee that fuel our passion!

Happy coding, everyone!",0,1762431698.0,programmer,1,0.5,False

1opxcpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1opxcpy/old_boss_refuses_to_give_me_my_tip_money_should/,"Old Boss refuses to give me my tip money, should In Gold to HR or just make peace?","So to preface this im writing this on mobile, im Not a native English speaker, autocorrect is beating my ass and I am extremely angry about this Situation. Sorry is this reads like shit

So I recently quit my Job at a big coffee company which you will probably know for its green Logo. Im not sure if it is more or less toxic in my country than it is in others, but Store Managers and Shift Supervisors can get away with Bullying and sexual harassment, as its cheaper replacing the Baristas. 

To keep the backstory short, I was moved to a different store and told it would be temporary. I emphasised that during the Semester I couldnt stay at that location as a 1h travel time to work is not something I signed up for. It was a surprise to noone that the 'temporary' Transfer turned out to be permanent. I wasnt really friends with anyone at that location, the coworkers there were either cordial, or in one case a shiftsupervisor singled me out and Bullied me. So I went Job Hunting and handed in my resignation once I secured a Job, told them I wanted to 'Focus on my studies'

The issues started when I quit. I was under the impression that I could go in two weeks, my assistant store Manager (=ASM, who is the Person that Handles these things) insisted it were 6. I signed the contract with the 6 weeks, contacted some workers rights thing the next day who informed me that was wrong, and my two weeks were factual. A Lot of backstory and forth with HR and my AMS Offers another contract where Im out by the Ende of october, which I appreciated as I genuinely thought they were going to try and keep me for as long as possible so at least that was settled peacefully. 

In the last week im supposed to work I get the worst cold of my life, which sucked because I actually would have liked to work. Im pretty sure that my ASM thought I faked being sick, by the way she spoke to me when I called in sick, but she hasnt outright said or accused me of anything. Ive been there to pick up my things since and she was very Hostile to me when I was there. 

Cut to present day, I message her, the actual Manager and the shiftsupervisor that handles the tip money. At this point ASM Has ignored my messages for 5 days straight. The shiftsupervisor tells me he was told to exclude me from the tip money, the actual Manager was like ""idk"" And is probably not going to do anything beyond that and then finally ASM answered. 

She claimed that I had taken food from our display for free and pretended to a shiftsupervisor I had the ASM's permission to do so, therefore shes taking the cost of that off of my tip money. Which isnt how theft is supposed to be handled anyways but in this case I dient even do what I am accused of. People Generally take with them leftover food at the End of the day with the permission of the shiftsupervisors, but thats not just me. 

The workers rights group informed me I dort really have a leg to stand on, and honestly, the a mount of tips is probably just like 15€ which is whatever. I am Mainly upset with this accusation and with this treatment of me and Im sick of having to just lay down and take whatever they want to dish out. 

My question is, should I write to HR? Best case I get my tip money or the ASM gets reprimanded, worst case this company actually files a report against me on some 'he said, she said' type thing. 

Or should I Choose peace for myself? Im happy at my new Job, I easily make at least Twice the amount in tips there, if not more. 15€ isnt exactly insignificant to me with my financial Situation but I could go without it. And thinking about writing HR and it Biting me in the ass is Stressing me out.

1opxbo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1opxbo9/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1762431306.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False
