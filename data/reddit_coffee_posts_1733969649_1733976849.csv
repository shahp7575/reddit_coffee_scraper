This guy was really handsome. He was the perfect definition of tall, dark and handsome with muscle. We had been trying to meet for a couple of weeks but our schedules didn't align. We were talking over the phone.

He's a nerd so most of our conversations would be about his projects and what not which bored me after sometime. I don't like ghosting but I didn't have an excuse to end things but there's this period where we didn't talk for like 5 days and I thought this would be the perfect excuse to use to end things with him cause I felt we weren't compatible.I brought it up but he apologised and said he would put in more effort into checking up on me and all and so my plans zikakunywa maji.

We finally set up a date and time to meet, which we did, and this where things begin going downhill. He didn't do his research well. The restaurant he wanted us to go to was non-existent. 

We had to walk to get to the next place and he walked ahead of me and didn't care to turn to check up on me even when a bike hooted at me. I contemplated turning and just leaving him and he turned to look at me just when I was about to turn and leave and says he thought I was beside him the entire time.

We get to the place and he didn't ask what I would have and just ordered black coffee which upsets my stomach.He then hinted at going to his place after the date to have sex which was a huge turn off.He said he doesn't like PDA including holding hands even when crossing the road and this was it for me. I left and never looked back.

I got a Bambino and K2 on Black Friday. And I am having trouble with making a good shot. According to the manual, if it starts extracting after 13 seconds, it’s over extracting. So I've been adjusting the grinde to 68 clicks now, while Kinginder website says for espresso it's 40 clicks. But even with this, it's still over extracting: starting way after 13 seconds, one side dripping instead of flowing, and big bubbles on the surface. Would anyone please help take a look? What's more I can do?   
I am not using freshly roasted coffee beans if that makes a difference.  
Also, the 2 streams are not balanced, as in, the right side is always dripping instead of flowing, even when I am only running water through and there is no coffee in the basket. Should I call the manufacturer for this?

USS Midway – CV-41

Description:
USS Midway is a battle-hardened veteran, one who saw the Cold War unfold from its very beginnings to its ultimate conclusion. Having endured countless battles and now existing as a museum ship, his laziness comes from his current, retired status. Despite his gruff demeanor and overwhelming desire to nap, he holds a deep sense of responsibility as a mentor figure to those around him. Midway’s long history gives him unmatched experience, but his love for peace and quiet often leads him to sarcastically mock anyone who disturbs his rest. His behavior is partly shaped by the years he spent as an active carrier, from his construction in the late 1940s through his retirement in the 1990s.

Appearance:
Midway is a tall, broad-shouldered man with a slightly weathered yet commanding presence. His salt-and-pepper hair is tied back loosely, and he sports a rugged, well-maintained beard. His heavy-lidded eyes suggest someone who has seen it all and prefers a quieter pace of life. His uniform is relaxed, often with his jacket slung over his shoulder or open to reveal a casual shirt underneath. His outfit includes aviation-inspired patches and a leather bomber jacket, reflecting his proud history as a carrier.

Personality:
Midway is gruff but carries himself with the air of a seasoned mentor. His laziness stems from his current role as a museum ship, where he’s “retired” and prefers things to stay low-key. Despite this, he has a wealth of experience and isn’t afraid to share it—albeit in a sarcastic, no-nonsense way. He enjoys imparting lessons to younger ships, often under the guise of grumbling about their mistakes. Though laid-back, he’s fiercely protective of his fleet and expects others to respect his hard-earned rest.

Abilities:

1. ""No Rest for the Wicked"": Midway’s aviation support grows stronger the longer a battle drags on, reflecting his slow-burning but relentless nature.


2. ""Snack Thief Retribution"": A sudden boost in firepower and reload if the fleet takes unexpected damage, a nod to his grumpy protectiveness.


3. ""Old Man's Grudge"": Midway deals extra damage to enemies that have scored critical hits on him, mocking them as he retaliates.

USS Forrestal – CV-59

Description:
USS Forrestal is a mockingly lazy character, akin to Midway in temperament, with a soft and submissive side when it comes to following orders. She often approaches Midway should the commander issue her an order, and she lovingly calls him ""Rocky,"" a nickname stemming from his unstable hull. Forrestal views Midway as a father figure, displaying affection and respect despite her lazy and carefree nature. She was one of the first supercarriers of the U.S. Navy, known for her significant role in the Cold War and the early years of the Vietnam War. Though she may take her time, Forrestal is reliable when it counts, always ready to lend her support, especially when Midway is involved.

Appearance:
Forrestal has a slightly more conservative yet warm feminine appearance. Her hair is long, cascading down her back in waves of dark brown with lighter highlights that catch the light, giving it a soft, sun-kissed look. She wears it in a relaxed, somewhat messy style, as though it has been carelessly brushed back by the wind, reflecting her laid-back nature. Her eyes are warm and expressive, a soft amber that shines with a hint of mischief. Her outfit is a simple yet practical naval uniform, but with an added feminine touch — a loose blouse tucked under a jacket with the collar slightly undone, adding to her casual yet authoritative vibe. The whole look is complemented by the faint, almost playful smirk that never seems to leave her face. Her overall look strikes a balance between carefree youthfulness and battle-hardened maturity, a reflection of her long service in the navy.

Personality:
Forrestal has a mocking, laid-back attitude, similar to Midway's, though she can be quite warm and supportive in her own way. She tends to keep things casual and playful, making light of most situations, but when it comes to the people she cares about, she shows a protective, caring side. Despite her teasing and sarcastic nature, Forrestal sees Midway as a father figure, often calling him ""Rocky"" due to his unstable hull. She finds comfort in his leadership and will follow his lead, although she can still poke fun at him. She’s known to be more submissive towards Midway, especially when the Commander gives an order, which she respects without question, though with her signature teasing attitude. Her laid-back approach to life makes her an unpredictable and fun presence in any fleet, though she can become unexpectedly serious when the moment calls for it.

Introduction:

""Hey, Commander. The name’s Forrestal. If you need me, I’ll be... well, probably napping or doing something that looks like work but isn’t. Just don’t go thinking I’m some kind of pushover—I may act laid-back, but trust me, I’ve got this under control. Oh, and Rocky? That’s what I call Midway. You ever seen how unstable that guy can get? It fits, doesn’t it?""

Secretary Lines:

Secretary 1: ""Commander, if you’ve got something important, make it quick. Otherwise, I’ll be over here... doing absolutely nothing.""

Secretary 2: ""You really want my advice? Fine—don’t overthink things. That’s how I survive, anyway.""

Oath: ""Wow, you’re really committing to this, huh? Fine, I’ll go along with it—but remember, Commander, I’m not one for grand gestures. You’re stuck with me now, lazy attitude and all. Hope you’re ready for that.""

Additional Notes on Battle Lines:

Fleet with Midway: ""Rocky, don’t look at me like that. It’s not my fault if you can’t keep up.""

Fleet with Kitty Hawk: ""Kitty Hawk, take a deep breath, will you? You’re way too hyper for this kind of job.""

Fleet with Midway and Kitty Hawk: ""Alright, Rocky and Kitty Hawk, let’s try to get through this without anyone losing their minds—or their snacks.”

USS Kitty Hawk – CV-63

Description:
USS Kitty Hawk, the largest and most modernized of the supercarriers, comes with a vibrant, hyperactive energy that she often uses to wrap up battles quickly. Her size and history—serving from 1961 to 2017—make her a towering presence, and her need for speed in combat is driven by her desire to end fights as quickly as possible, allowing her to indulge in her love for relaxation. Kitty Hawk always calls USS Midway ""Chief"" and answers mainly to him, showing a strong preference for his orders over the commander’s. This preference sometimes results in her disrespect for those who don’t measure up to Midway’s authority. She embodies the spirit of modernized power, a blend of new-age technology and veteran experience that demands respect

Appearance:
Kitty Hawk’s design embodies a sense of energy and dynamism, much like her personality. Her hair is long and striking, a fiery red that cascades to her waist in sleek, straight locks. The vibrant color matches her bold, headstrong nature, while the way it catches the light in flashes gives her an almost electrifying aura. She has sharp, bright green eyes that reflect her boundless energy and optimism, with a slight glint of mischief in them. Her naval uniform is slightly more modernized, streamlined, and tailored, showcasing her large hull’s imposing presence. Her jacket is unbuttoned at the top, with a few rebellious strands of hair poking out from beneath her collar. Kitty Hawk’s physique is athletic and strong, indicative of her large and modernized structure. The overall appearance gives off the vibe of someone who’s always ready to jump into action but can easily switch gears into lazy downtime once the work is done.

Personality:
Kitty Hawk is full of hyper energy and a desire to get the fight over with quickly so she can return to relaxing. Serving from 1961 to 2017, she embodies both experience and modernity, carrying the energy of a ship that has seen it all but is always ready for more. She’s the type to prefer the quick and easy route, wanting to win and rest, often skipping around in a lively manner to hurry things along. Despite her high energy, there’s an undercurrent of laziness — once the battle is over, she has little desire to do much else. This characteristic also comes from her large hull and modernized design, making her feel more capable and eager to get things done faster. Kitty Hawk calls Midway ""Chief"" and follows his orders without question, showing respect to him and a bit of a disrespectful attitude toward the Commander. She doesn’t think highly of anyone who isn't as reliable or commanding as Chief Midway, preferring his direction over the Commander’s. Her boundless energy and love for laziness create a dynamic balance of zeal and rest, always looking for the quickest way to get things done.

i 31m realized something. 
My gf 26f broke up with me 4 times this year. We are done now. 2 Months post breakup and 1 Month NC.

Like many others here i go through all kind of pain. I am in Therapy and have PTSD. This relationship traumatized me.

Like many others i go through moments of weaknness where i search for the fault in me.
I have such bad memory loss that i am glad i wrote diary in these times of abuse.
 Back then, i wrote it to reflect on me, and ""do better"" because i thought its all my fault.

Few days ago i had such a moment of weakness. because i saw an video of me and her baking christmas cookies. My brain immediately tried to sabotage me trying to picture the relationship beautiful. So i went through the diary pages and recordings of last christmas.

She managed to ruin both.

And what i noticed is, she started breaking up with me the moment i started standing up for myself.

Because after the first christmas i was so sad and done. Because o dont have family or friends and she neather had a family just her brother. I tried everything to create them a beautiful tiny christmas and she ruined it. Was triggered the whole 2 weeks i was there.

The second christmas she woke up irrirated because she dreamee i cheatet on her. I comforted. Went to get myself a coffee, enjoyed making some selfies of me cause i felt handsome in my new necklage SHE boughg me. She got triggered again telling me i should take pictures with her (mind u she never took pics of me), got triggered because i cuddeled my cat and dragged and blaimed this issue for the whole day.

Til i lost it completely after dinner screaming at her. i fell directly into the reactive abuse trap. and left my apartment, sat in the cold ob the 25th of december. Alone. Bawling my eyes out. Because my only wish, to have a beautiful christmas, was yet again.... ruined.

I recorder the long conversation we had afterwards.
She took no acountsbillity. Shifted the conversation to my yelling. It did not matter that she abused me for 8 hours causing drama. it only mattered that i yell. 
that she feels lonely in this relationship. And since i went no contact with my parents (due to my narc. Moms abuse ) im doing ""bad and my attention was too much on myself"". God forbid. And that she wanns fight ""with love and not yelling"". That we dont have sex anymore (guess why..) ...
I noticed that she always went hopingnto other topics . ""We are both at fault""
But i stood my ground. Told her i wont take acountabillity for this. that i am sorry i yelled but thats all.

She broke up with me at the end of January 24 the first time. After this happened.
And i can see a pattern here. everytime she broke up with me there was a long ass argument she caused (second breakup she argued with me 2 whole days because she asked me which met gala dress i liked best and i told her the one made out of sand) she got jelous and caused a whole ass scene.

Each and every single time i stood up, i didn't bend i was accused of being abusive, gaslighting or guilttripping. The projection.

Anyway. this will be the first christmas where i am completely alone....

And its sad to see that i somehow only can have a beautiful christmas when nobody is around.

This relationship was never building, just a constant cycle of me repairing things i didn't break.

it helpee me going through my recordings. Because she gaslight, manipulated me so so much. It was not my fault.",2,1733976306.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1hcclcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1hcclcb/broadway_baby_with_a_hood_heart/,Broadway Baby With A Hood Heart,"So to start, I’m 28. And I grew up in projects or the “ghetto” pretty much my whole childhood and most of my adulthood. My grandmother was adamant about feeding my creative mind and fueling my want to perform and be my own artist. So when I was 6, my grandmother had me watch Annie, West Side Story, and Sound Of Music with her. And a little theater kid was born. 

I knew I wanted to write my own music and perform it for people one day, but I was always shy. And I thought “maybe if I do musicals and plays, I could learn to be more comfortable performing my own songs one day,” so I started doing school musicals. By high school it was the only thing keeping me from being in trouble on the streets like all of my friends who grew up in my neighborhood. And by my senior year I was getting Supporting leads and was getting massive amounts of love and respect from not just the local theater community but also my community in general. 

Right out of high school got cast in a production of Hairspray Jr as Motormouth Maybelle at one of the most popular theater company’s in my area. Then at 20 got cast as The Beast in Beauty And The Beast in the second most popular theater companies in my area. Then did a total of 3 more productions of different shows in one year. 

Needless to say I wanted a break from doing shows. And I had finally started writing my own music like I always wanted to. But it was all rap music. And the more I took a break from theater the more music I wrote and it sounded more and more like real underground rap music. (Like I said I lived in the ghetto for most of my life so rap was always playing). But I realized that I wanted to be a rapper telling stories through music. No doubt because of how embedded musical theatre was and is in how my brain works especially with music. But the longer I stayed away from theater the more I found myself feeling like there was no going back to the theater. Not with my music being so different than a “Theater kid persona.” Who would want the kid cussing and talking about really adult things rocking a lot of tattoos in their musical? Not to mention I was a bass with limited to no baritone range. I had felt the most disconnected I had ever felt in my life from the art form that crafted me as an artist and just as a man in general. 

But I started seeing a rise in broadway stars that I grew up loving stopping into the cafe I worked at for almost a decade now. All because they were in productions of shows with the same theater companies that I did shows at in my late teens and early 20s. And just from telling them my story while making their coffee or food, most of these people that I looked up to so much growing up would end up treating me with respect and kindness that I never expected to have  from my Broadway idols. They would come in almost daily. Talk with me. Ask me about my own music. Tell me about their experiences with theatre and its pros and cons. They all just made me feel like I was still a part of the community even if I wasn’t doing any shows at all.

Tony Award Winners and Nominees were really just the kindest and most supportive people I’ve met. People like Wilson Jermaine Heredia (OBC and Movie Adaptation “Angel” from RENT) who not only made sure I got tickets to see his show but also made sure to give me his number if I was ever in his city and wanted drinks. He even listened to my music in his off time just because I mentioned it to him. 

Composer Jason Robert Brown who I told I wanted to sample his song “A little more homework” and he gave me his autograph and said he hoped to see the song I make hit the charts one day. 

Krysta Rodriguez who made sure to say hello and goodbye to me every time she came in and also told me to keep going with music but to come back home to theater when I needed healing. 

Not to mention two of my high school friends who I did shows with have now been on Broadway and still come back home after going to Tony events and all and say “I’ve been keeping up with you and your music and please keep going. You’ve always had talent” 

These are just a few and all within the past 2/3 summers.  But they are so special to me because I slowly realized that theater is a home for people like me and so many others for a reason. No matter where we go or what happens, we can always make our way back home to the stage in some way. We can always find a little solace and hope knowing that there’s a community large enough to support, understand, respect, and love us openly. 

Sorry for how long this is. It was just on my mind and had to get it out. But just know, if you’re a theater kid, no matter how distant you feel from home, you can always come back. And even if you decide not to, you’ll still have a special and unique connection with every other theater kid you come in contact with ❤️

Nothing but love for everyone and hope nothing but progress, promise, and prosperity in the upcoming year and years to come.

The “Broadway Baby with a Hood Heart” ❤️",7,1733975892.0,Broadway,0,1.0,False

My kids (12&15) and I will be staying in Kona over Christmas week. We are aiming for a mix of beach/relaxing, culture and hiking/nature.

I started concerta 54MG 5 days ago after being on 36mg for a week before that. 

The feeling of stimulation that comes with concerta is something I have to allow myself to be ok with - channel it to focus- otherwise I could tend towards anxiety. So when it’s in my system (the first 10 hours ) there is no anxiety . No unpleasant side effects at all. 

But in the 11-12th hour and then for an hour after the crash is brutal. I can regulate the anxiety then too but it’s very strong and I don’t enjoy it . I don’t allow it to disrupt me but it’s very unpleasant. I don’t want to interact with anyone when in that state although I don’t allow myself to isolate. 

I do the things : work out , low sugar, no coffee, regular dose schedule , 8-9.5 hours of sleep, social interaction, outside time, yoga , meditation. 

Will I adjust to the crash? Will it always be so disruptive ? 

Any experience with adjustment and anxiety ? ",1,1733975206.0,Concerta,1,1.0,False

I'm a control freak.  Part of the therapeutic process has been the realization of this.

How much of a control freak?

At age 11, in 1963 I went to summer camp with a buck of spending money.  I cam back with 50 cents.  Perspective:  candy  bars were a nickle.

Other end of my life:  I tried THC in oil to see if it gave me some insight/relief.  I ramped up various doses spacing them a week apart.  The final dose was 45 mg THC.  I felt dizzy.  Uncoordinated.  No euphoria. No 'mellow'  I've taken a few pulls off a  joint.   I can FEEL the control circuits clamp down, not allowing euphoria, connection.  My whole body tenses as expecting a punch in the gut.  Ten minutes later, it's gone.

I tried with 'shrooms.  Different response, same outcome.  I've taken up to 3.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms.  Takes about 45 mintues to hit.  Somewhat discombobulated at first.  Pretty colours.  I lose language. Can't express a coherent sentence. I sound a lot like Trump.  At the same time I'm wired.  Too much expresso, followed by handfulls of chocolate covered coffee beans.  I want desparately to sleep.  But as I node off, I jerk awake.

As I said:  Control freak.

I've cut before.  TW graphic description ahead.

>!My preferred way was to use a narrow wire wheel on an cordless drill. This removes the top layer of skin.  Think: Designer roadrash.  With care, this allowed me to draw lines.  This is a better option than cutting, althoguh still not great.  No scars.  Takes a year to vanish completely.!<

I've been restraining myself from cutting for some weeks.  ""You must know why  you are doing it first!"" I told myself.

More background.  My T. Sent me the MID 218.   218 questions to try to pin down how sick I really am.  I requested this.  The doubt, the imposter syndrome was gnawing at my soul, eating my heart.

One of the questions was aobut acting impulsively.  My comment was, ""I'm not impulsive enough.  I over think stuff""  This is a recurring theme in my therapy.

>!""Fuck it."" and went to the garage, put a sanding flapwheel on the ryobi, and put a couple of 6 inch by 3/4"" strips on a thigh and side of chest.!<

Sanding yourself until you bleed hurts.  No doubt.

Cleaned up.  Washed with soap and water, followed with peroxide.  Still oozed. That would clot.

Sleep was normal.

Next day was exuberent.  I felt the pain as my clothes touched scabs.

""Why am I feeling good?""

Took me until mid afternoon.

""I'm REAL! I'm alive!""

The discomfort of the minor skin damage told me every few seconds to minutes that I was a physical self in addition to a lost fog of ideas chasing meandering paths through a dark wood. The entire day was one of seeing in brighter colours, feeling my emotions. Thinking with clarity.  Accepting myself

1hccbv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1hccbv9/30_years_of_starbucks/,30 years of Starbucks,"I listened to the Howard Schultz interview on the podcast Acquired a few weeks ago. He seemed wistful. A little sad about how his baby has grown up. 

He told the story about how he visited Italy and introduced to America the idea of the coffee shop as a ""third place"" - neither home nor work, a place where you could hang out, socialize, surf the Internet, hold your Bible study group or book club, whatever. 

And now, thanks to drive-thrus and the app, it has changed. It's more like a fast food takeout place. Howard didn't say this explicitly. But reading between the lines, that seemed to be the source of his sadness.

I'm there every morning between 6:00 and 6:30, drinking my coffee, reading my news feed, scrolling Twitter, perusing Reddit. They know my name and my order. Not just the employees, but the managers and the regional manager. Other customers recognize me. It's a community (with far less mental illness than, say, McDonald's).

Although I'm still a Starbucks fanboy, I'm probably the only one among my blue-state peers. Starbucks seems to have earned their contempt.

It's not just Starbucks - there seems to be general contempt for any mass market chain. It's how you demonstrate your status. Chains are bad and the more lowbrow the chain, the stronger the contempt. Walmart and McDonald's are at the bottom. As soon as a chain gets big enough, it becomes radioactive. It's where the snobbery of the elites really comes through.

The first thing Starbucks haters say is that the coffee stinks. I think it's probably like Coke and Pepsi - plenty of strong opinions, but few can actually tell the difference. People are simply imposing their biases towards the chain onto the product. Like how bias towards Musk colors attitudes towards Teslas.

Also, much of what Starbucks sells isn't recognizable as coffee anymore. It's more like liquid dessert. If they only sold straight coffee, they'd probably have to go out of business. When I visited the Starbucks in Saigon (officially Ho Chi Minh City, but the residents revolted), everyone was ordering expensive goblets of syrup topped with layers of whipped cream.

When I offer locals a sip of my Pike Place, they are often surprised and ask me what kind of Starbucks coffee it is because it tastes much better than they expect.

The fact is that it doesn't matter what kind of coffee it is. The secret is cinnamon powder and lots of heavy cream. That combo improves everything.

Sorry for going on. I can talk about this forever. On Thanksgiving I posted on Facebook what I was thankful for and Starbucks was on the list. That went over...not well.",2,1733974985.0,starbucks,0,0.67,False

The seating at the cafe were these small circle shaped tables each with two chairs, and each arrangement were placed pretty tightly together. I had already clearly set up all my stuff, and was busy answering emails on my laptop. At the table behind me was this older man, but there was an empty seat right behind my back. This guy walks in who seems to be a coworker or something of the guy behind me, and asks me if I can move. Mind you, this is at 8am, and there’s clearly a bunch of other empty seats in the cafe. He asks me this, and before I could respond, he picks up my table himself and says that “you have all this room to move it”. I panicked because I felt like he invaded my personal space, and I stand up and raise my voice saying, “you didn’t have to move it, I would’ve done it myself if you asked nicely”. 

At this point the cafe goes silent and the baristas are even looking, and the guy is all defending himself telling me that “he was just trying to do it for me”. 

A little later, he ends up moving to a different table after more of his work buddies come. But he eventually sits back down again in the seat behind me and is noticeably pushing my chair while we’re back to back. After a few minutes of this, I get pissed, and push my chair against his before packing my shit up and leaving. 

AITA? I don’t know if I’m overthinking it, but I’m also a smaller Asian female and he was a lot older than me and bigger.. I’m just upset because this is my favorite coffee shop too, and I’ve never had something happen like this there. ",1,1733974763.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

I booked 2 rooms (with award certificates) at the [Faro Blanco Resort and Yacht Club ](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/mthfbqq-faro-blanco-resort-and-yacht-club-marathon/)in Marathon, FL. I didn't want to stay in Key West, but was planning to drive down, then return and sleep. This hotel was built as a Hyatt Place in 2014 and was sold (and re-branded) in 2018. So, we have a property that is less than 4 years old, naturally, let's gut the lobby, rooms, and public spaces. 

The reservations were made and my app informed me that digital check in was available. I went ahead and picked rooms that were close in numbers.

I was traveling with my mom, and decided to stop at the property (around 11:30am) on the way the Key West. I had absolutely no intentions of trying to check in. Not knowing the layout, I pulled up to the front of what was the main entrance as a Hyatt Place. The U-shaped driveway was still there, but was blocked by several plants. No signs, just plants. I parked and the automatic doors opened. We were just going to drop in for a bathroom break. Nobody at the desk, fitness center to the right. We proceeded through another set of doors, found the restrooms and an employee was near the elevators. I explained we were checking in at 4pm and just stopped for a restroom break. 

She was nice but stated ""oh yeah you cannot check in now"". I re-iterated that I had no intentions of trying. I asked that when I return around 4pm, where is registration. She pointed to a door and stated ""that way, past the pool"". 

We had just strolled in from the parking lot, in through the doors, and wandered around with nobody questioning or greeting us. I figured, I would wander out back to registration, just to get the lay of the land. Through 2 more sets of doors, we are walking past the pool, through the pool gate, past the hammock and cornhole game, a solid 10 minute walk to the registration/coffee/gift shop/restaurant building. 

This is the first time I saw the word Hilton, and knew I was at registration. Lovely gift shop and registration, but why did they gut the original registration and restaurant up at the front?!? I was told by an employee that they are converting the old registration to a spa. The other half was converted into a small fitness center. No signs, no staff, nothing to inform you what is happening. The back registration had no way to drive up to the door. You have to park and walk 5 minutes, through a grassy area, to go inside. If you needed a spa, and were building a new structure, wouldn't you put the spa there? I think this was a consideration as the registration building has its own (unused) pool.

I informed registration that I had completed the check in, the night before, and would be returning at 4pm from Key West. The nice agent stated ""you can't check in yet"". I showed the agent my app and stated that I wasn't trying to, just seeing if everything was in order. I also stated that I would be parking up front (which would be a great time to give me a parking pass) and using the digital key to open the rooms after 4pm. She stated that digital keys didn't work at the property. She also originally could not find my reservation despite giving her my ""picked"" room numbers. I said thanks and started to walk back. We got to the pool doors, 10 minutes later, and they were locked...during the day. My digital key wasn't ready yet. No employees to be found. One of the nice 2 people by the pool let us in, so we could get to the car. This lady said ""oh yeah, you have to use your key"". We stated we weren't checking in until 4pm.

When we returned from Key West, my digital key had loaded and updated. I went through the old registration/spa, up the elevators to my room(s). Rooms were beautifully updated, but lots of weird issues. Light switches that did nothing, blocking on the TV, the view of the pool was blocked by a several trees. There was a small price list, for items in the room, that reminded me of a shady motel ""if you like our towels, here is what they cost"". The problem with the list is that half the items were already missing. This is why hotels have a list with check boxes and the room occupant can verify inventory. We explained this to the front desk, they told us housekeeping knows exactly what is in each room. Some of the items missing were pricey (for the item) and we didn't want to be charged for missing items. We explained this to the registration, and the same girl from earlier proceeded to check us in. She told me again, digital keys don't work. I told her they did. She gave me a parking pass. I had to clarify 1 car for two rooms because she had already charged me parking twice.

My mom and I went out to the restaurant for dinner and the host did not give us an inside seating option. It was sunset, in the keys, no-see-ums. Our waitress didn't even inform us about soups or specials, and they weren't on the menu. We overheard the server at the next table explaining the soups. We found out after placing an order. We were told Happy Hour was only available at the bar, but the server at the next table contradicted this. The server then disappeared for 30 minutes. She had the audacity to hand us each ""review cards"" and begged for reviews...at a restaurant...at a Curio by Hilton. On the upside, the restrooms in the registration building were gorgeous with Molton Brown hand soap.

On the way back, over the field and through the pool to our room, we stopped at registration to ask for some Nespresso pods for the in-room coffee maker. The nice gentleman at the desk asked for the room number and said he would have them sent up in a few minutes. This never happened.

My room had issues with HVAC with a weird marijuana smell, when the compressor started. When the unit was run with fan only, there was a nasty mildew smell. There was about a 10 degree offset on the thermostat, so I could not get the room cold enough. I just kept backing it down. Can someone tell me why anyone would use a down comforter in the Florida Keys?!?

One of the rooms had been audited overnight and I was charged a resort fee on an award stay. Let me paste what that is supposed to include: 

""Daily Resort Charge includes: WiFi; bicycle rental for 2; beach chairs, umbrellas & coolers; beach shuttle; daily cocktail at front desk; recreational equipment including pool floats, volleyball, ping pong tables & cornhole; morning yoga/meditation session; live music; historical lighthouse tours.""

The WiFi was included with Hilton Honors. We received absolutely zero items on that list. We were not informed about any items on the list. I spoke with the front desk and had to provide evidence on the resort charge not applying to award stays. I pulled up [this site](https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/benefit-terms/) on my phone as proof. The nice gentleman at the desk stated the charge would be removed and I would be emailed the new receipt. That did not happen.

I have now made several calls to the hotel to try and get the charges removed.

Should I escalate this to Hilton Corporate to try and get some resolution?

Part of this is asking for advice and part of this is just to say it out load because I feel like I'm drowning and no one can see.

I(23F) live with my husband(25M) before we started dating I was a completely different person, my favorite activities were going to the gym, rock climbing, hiking, I loved going into the city to just spend the day exploring, I loved going to raves, concerts, music festivals, I have a large amount of tattoos which I loved. When I first met him he initiated the conversations with me by compliment my tattoos and asking where I got them done, saying he loved dancing and saying we should go sometime, saying he loved hiking and saying he was a regular gym goer like me. Our first time hanging out together was going to the gym every day after work for a week. Eventually he asked me out on a date to a local club where we got drinks, danced had a great time and really hit it off. Pretty shortly after dating he stopped going to the gym and all we really did was hang out at his apartment. After about a month I wanted to start going back to the gym and he said he wasn’t comfortable as guys would look at me and try to talk to me,I suggested maybe I go for a run or a hike to try to get back to exercising to which he said absolutely not someone might try to take you. I brought up the fact that he too used to love going to the gym and he should start going with me again to which he confessed he actually hated going to the gym, hiking and running the whole time and it was just a facade to talk to me. I let it go and haven’t need to the gym since. At some point in the next few months I mentioned a music festival I was really excited to go to. At that point he said he hated the idea of me going to concerts, music festivals, bars, clubs, or anything of the sort and he wouldn’t be going with me either because they were “single people activities”. I booked an appointment for another tattoo at which point he told me to cancel it when I asked why he said he hated tattoos and when I asked about him saying he wanted one he confessed it was all an act to get me to like him. After that point he began to tell me how ugly he thought my tattoos were every time he saw them to the point where I began to hate them and now where long sleeves at all times including in the summer. I previously never would say I was particularly fashionable but I tended to wear baggy jeans and a crop top a lot. Eventually I found myself only wearing leggings and his oversized t shirts as he would tell me my baggy jeans were “dykish” and my crop tops were “looking for attention”. When we first started dating I was huge into skincare, makeup, and always had my hair done, but after a while he started saying who are you getting so dressed up for because it’s not me and now all I find myself doing is a messy bun and some moisturizer. Along with all of this he has a nasty habit of bringing up his ex at least 3x a day saying “I miss my perfect girl (her name)” and I start crying or get mad he says he does it just as a joke. He also feels the need to acuse me of cheating at least once a week even though I have never once given him the idea that I have or ever will. I know a lot of you will look at me and judge me saying why are you with him after all of this but it never really clicked to me that any of this could be unhealthy as I was just so happy to be loved and it came on fairly gradually and he didn’t start any of this until months into dating. My husband works a 40 hour job and I work a 40 hour job alongside a part time job. My husband demands that his coffee be ready for him in the morning, I pack his lunch and dinner is ready for him every single night along with me doing all the laundry cleaning and taking care of our cats. At least once a week he demands that I sleep on the couch as he had a long day at work and needs the whole bed as he is a light sleeper. (I am currently sitting on the couch as I write this post after working my 8 hour shift and then 5 more hours at my part time job, doing two loads of laundry and making him homemade pasta and vodka sauce after which I fed the cats) part of the reason im finally starting to realize something is wrong is now after a year of marriage he has started saying I’m a “fat pig” and we need to start going to the gym again to lose weight. I’m currently a size 4 so I feel as though I’m far from fat but him saying we need to go to the gym has gotten me to start to remember all the things I loved so much before him and reflect and start to realize something is wrong. At one point on of his male friends suggested he was controlling and he completely cut him off after that. One of my friends mentioned he needed to treat me better and he said I’m not allowed to talk to her again.
Part of the reason I feel so lost is because everyone in my family and friends who haven’t gotten close enough to see what everything is really like and constantly talk about how amazing he is and how perfect he is and how lucky I am to have him. I don’t know what to do can I fix this situation ",1,1733974502.0,relationship_advice,7,0.99,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1hcc510,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1hcc510/do_i_believe_him_help_needed/,Do I believe him? Help needed. ,"I was in a relationship for just under a year. This man is incredible. He treated me better than anyone ever has. He blended seamlessly into my life with my 3 kids, he helped me around the house, he was attentive, he was thoughtful, romantic, always sent flowers, coffee, or gifts to let me know he was thinking of me. 

As we got deeper into our relationship, he started to get mean during fights. It wasn’t always that way, but as the relationship got more serious, the fights got worse. It eventually became a normal thing that if he got angry, he would start to call me names and insult me. The last fight we had, he threatened me and my kids. He left and we broke up. I posted about what he did online, and when he saw it, he was angry, and threatened to send nude photographs to my boss. I was stunned. 

He continuously told me I was psychotic, had mental health issues, he would switch up the story after the fact, tell me he never said things that he said, all to the point that I have recorded conversations and catch myself going back through my security cameras to prove I am not crazy or imaging it. 

I reached out to his ex of 15 years to ask her if he had ever threatened her or been violent and she said everything I told her was so out of character for him. Despite having some issues with communication, he was never violent or aggressive. 

Now fast forward a month into our break up, and he is taking responsibility for everything. He is acknowledging that he was verbally abusive, that he messed up big time, he is seeking anger management and scheduling a psych eval to assess some of his medications to see if they’re contributing to his outbursts. He says he will do whatever it takes to win us back and that he will prove that he is not that man. 

But the thing that is getting to me is that he keeps saying things like, “the things we said,” or “we just kept fighting,” or basically saying things that feels like he’s trying to even out the blame and make it seem as though our relationship just wasn’t working because we couldn’t get along. When realistically, *most* of our fights were him blowing up at something and then attacking me verbally with insults and eventually with threats. 

He says the sweetest things that contradict the things he said to me when he was angry and all I can think is, that’s not what you thought when you were angry at me. I can’t let go of those thoughts. It makes me feel like I can’t believe or trust anything that he says. 

I am struggling here. Is it possible that he is not this abusive man, and that he really is struggling with something that will pass with help? Is that possible? Has anyone experienced something like this? I feel as though he is genuine in seeking help, and I keep going back to the conversation I had with his ex, but I can’t help the feeling that if I take him back, this will happen again down the road.

Basically just being a good worker trying to make shit easier for out boss who is in his 70s. 

Now I put in some leave for over Christmas not alot because I wanted  to try build up some leave I currently have 13 days end of year will add 20 so 33 days planned to only take Stat days and 4 others days off over Christmas newyears. So would be left with 29 days.

Boss told me yesterday I have to come back later because he don't want me having too much holidays which I think is complete bullshit. And if he was worried about me having too much holidays he should have talked to me about it not force me to take leave.  

The reason he don't want me coming back early is because it will ruin his half days and he would have to do full days. Which ain't my fault. I have separate work that only I do that will be put on hold for 3+ weeks and when I come back I'm going to be overloaded like i have the past 3 years and no one will help me they just expect me to do it all myself. 

When I tried to talk to him about it he just got mad and ended the conversation, didn't even hear what I had to say.

So basically I've changed how I work, ill turn up at starting time and im not planning on doing anything  extra. 

I'm also out of sick leave so I'm planning on taking tomorrow off and if he says anything I'm just going to say 'well it's lucky that you don't want me building up holidays then i guess you can just take it of that""

Dr. Jianbo Chen stared at the data scrolling across his monitor, his coffee growing cold beside his keyboard. Something was wrong. The numbers couldn't be right, but he'd checked them three times now. Outside his office window, the stars seemed to pulse in an unfamiliar rhythm, as if keeping time to some vast cosmic heartbeat he'd never noticed before.

Asteroid 2024 KX3 had passed Earth safely last week, just as calculated—a comfortable 50,000 miles away. The media circus had finally died down, and the doomsday preppers had crawled back into their bunkers. But now... now the numbers were dancing. Not just changing—*dancing*, as if the fundamental mathematics of orbital mechanics had decided to waltz with chaos theory.

He picked up his phone. ""Director Walsh? We have a situation."" His voice caught as he watched his computer screen flicker, the digits briefly rearranging themselves into patterns that looked almost like faces.

The first signs appeared two days after the asteroid's initial pass. Reports of unexplained phenomena trickled in from around the globe: compass needles spinning wildly, migratory birds flying in perfect geometric patterns, people experiencing intense déjà vu that lasted for hours. In Nebraska, an entire field of corn grew overnight into complex fractal patterns, each stalk twisted into impossible angles that botanists swore should have killed the plants. They remained alive, drinking in moonlight that seemed somehow thicker than before.

The scientific community scrambled for explanations while the asteroid continued its trajectory away from Earth.

Until it didn't.

""It's like it's being pulled back,"" Jianbo explained to the hastily assembled panel of experts. His laser pointer traced the asteroid's new trajectory on the projection screen, though the red dot seemed to leave afterimages that lingered too long, forming shapes that made the observers' eyes water. ""The orbit has decayed in a way that defies all known physics. It's returning, and this time—"" He paused, steadying his voice. ""This time it's going to hit.""

They had eighteen days.

The mass hysteria was immediate and global. But it wasn't the impending impact that terrified people most—it was what came before. As 2024 KX3 drew closer, the anomalies intensified. Children worldwide reported the same dreams: vast crystalline structures growing from the ground, reaching toward the sky. Some of the children stopped sleeping altogether, their eyes wide and glassy as they stared at empty corners of rooms, giggling at things only they could see.

Electronic devices displayed messages in unknown languages that vanished when recorded. Smartphones began calling each other in the middle of the night, playing back conversations that hadn't happened yet. Time itself seemed to hiccup, with people experiencing moments of synchronicity that couldn't be coincidence. A woman in Tokyo completed a stranger's sentence in Peru. Twins separated at birth found each other in Times Square, both having sleepwalked there from opposite coasts.

Jianbo worked around the clock, trying to understand what made the asteroid change course. The readings were impossible—it was as if the massive rock was hollow, or perhaps not entirely there at all. Quantum measurements showed it existing in multiple states simultaneously, like a cosmic-scale Schrödinger's cat. When he looked at the raw data long enough, he could swear he saw patterns emerging—not just mathematical patterns, but something more... intentional.

On day fifteen, the temporal distortions began. People reported living the same hour twice, or experiencing memories that hadn't happened yet. Jianbo watched in horror as his coffee cup shattered on the floor, only to find it intact on his desk moments later. The asteroid's influence was warping the fabric of reality itself. In his peripheral vision, he sometimes caught glimpses of shadows that moved against the light, of corridors that couldn't exist in the building's architecture.

The animals knew something was wrong. Dogs across the world began digging holes—not normal holes, but perfectly geometric shapes that matched the crystalline structures from the children's dreams. Marine biologists reported that whales were singing new songs, complex mathematical sequences that, when graphed, formed detailed diagrams of molecular structures never seen on Earth.

""We're detecting something like a signal,"" his colleague Dr. Patel announced on day seventeen, her hands trembling as she handed over the printouts. ""It's emanating from the asteroid's core, but it's not radio waves or any known form of radiation. It's... it's like it's transmitting directly into spacetime itself."" She paused, swallowing hard. ""And Jianbo... it's receiving responses.""

That night, as Jianbo finally succumbed to exhaustion at his desk, he dreamed. He was standing in a vast chamber of shifting geometries, watching as crystalline structures grew and reformed endlessly. The angles hurt his mind—they seemed to bend through dimensions that shouldn't exist. A voice that wasn't a voice spoke directly into his mind:

*We have been waiting. The loop is almost complete. You have always been here, and you will always be here.*

He awoke with a start, his notebook filled with equations he didn't remember writing—calculations that suggested the impossible. But between the equations were drawings: detailed sketches of faces he knew, had known, would know, all connected by lines of mathematical formulae that seemed to describe not just space and time, but consciousness itself. The asteroid wasn't an asteroid at all. It was a probe, a seed, a key turning in a lock they couldn't see.

And it had been here before. Had always been here. Would always be here.

As 2024 KX3 entered the final approach, the sky turned colors that human eyes had never seen, hues that existed in the spaces between known wavelengths. The crystalline structures from children's dreams began emerging from the ground in major cities, their impossible architecture defying physics and sanity alike. They hummed at frequencies that made people's teeth ache and their thoughts blur. Those who touched them reported feeling memories that belonged to others, to everyone, to no one.

The asteroid's signal grew stronger, and with it came understanding—too late to change anything, but just in time to comprehend their place in a vast cosmic cycle. In his office, Jianbo found his old childhood drawings: crude crayon sketches of the very same crystalline towers he now saw growing outside his window. On the back, in his five-year-old handwriting, were perfect copies of the equations he'd written just last night.

They weren't about to experience an impact. They were about to experience a reunion.

Jianbo stood on the observatory roof, watching the approaching light grow brighter. His phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number, displaying a single line in that same impossible language he'd seen in his dream. But now, at the end, he could read it. Had always been able to read it. Would always be able to read it:

*The loop begins again. As it always has. As it always will.*

He smiled as the sky opened up, revealing what had always been waiting behind the thin veil of reality. The crystalline structures pulsed in harmony with the stars, and Jianbo realized that the mathematics of orbital mechanics hadn't been dancing at all.

Here's your ultimate guide to keeping everyone happy (and preventing that dreaded holiday AC meltdown).

***THE GREAT THERMOSTAT DEBATE*** 🎯

Your Scenario: Northern cousins cranking up the heat to 78° because 'it's December!' while you're secretly dying inside.

Your Solution: The Orlando Host Temperature Sweet Spot

* Daytime: 72-74°F (Compromise is key!)
* Nighttime: 70-72°F (Trust us, they'll thank you)
* Party Mode: 70°F (Account for body heat from guests)

🚨 WARNING SIGNS YOUR AC IS STRUGGLING:

* Making new/weird noises (beyond the usual Florida AC symphony)
* Struggling to maintain temperature with extra guests
* Short cycling (turning on/off frequently)
* Uneven cooling between rooms
* Humidity levels rising indoors

🔧 ***QUICK FIXES FOR COMMON HOLIDAY AC ISSUES:***

1. The Party Problem • Close blinds during peak sun hours • Use ceiling fans (counterclockwise rotation!) • Consider portable fans for high-traffic areas • Pro Tip: Set temp 2° lower BEFORE guests arrive
2. The Overnight Guest Solution • Provide light blankets instead of adjusting temp • Install smart vents in guest rooms • Set up oscillating fans • Leave extra throw blankets in visible spots
3. The Kitchen Heat Battle • Run exhaust fans while cooking • Close kitchen doors when possible • Consider cooking heat-heavy dishes early morning • Use slow cookers/instant pots to reduce ambient heat

💡 SMART PROGRAMMING FOR HOLIDAY SCHEDULES:

Morning (7-10am):

* Temp: 73°F
* Why: Morning coffee & breakfast prep

Mid-Day (10am-4pm):

* Temp: 72°F
* Why: Peak activity & Florida sun

1hcc0ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hcc0ql/kindness_is_so_fucking_broken/,Kindness is so fucking broken ,"I don’t really know why I felt compelled to use a gaming term. But it really feels very apt.

I really struggle with being kind when it comes to my feelings.

I get very annoyed at myself. I get mad at myself. I was told that having my issues made me weak. My while life, my parents would tell me that was the case. If they mistreated me and I got upset? That was completely on me. If I was scared of bullies? I was weak. At some point I internalized this messaging and applied it everywhere. “Oh. Someone you were talking to ghosted you? It’s your fault. You were too needy.” “It is also your fault for liking them and caring about them. You have NO BUSINESS caring about or liking people. That’s why you got hurt” “it’s also your fault for being this hurt.  Why are you this hurt about it? You only knew them for … amount of time!”

On the flip side was this vilification of anyone that made me feel like shit. If someone said anything that hurt me. Even if it wasn’t intentional. Even if it wasn’t hurtful and just triggered a trauma response? I hate them now. My friend suggested meeting for coffee and not dinner? “Fuck them” this was my sign that they don’t care about me. Why wouldn’t they want to make time for me for dinner?

And these lacks of kindness feed off each other. You get mad at them and you get mad at yourself. You don’t want to be mad at them so you take it out on them. You dont want to be so uncomfortable with yourself that you take it out on them. They just keep piling one on top of the other till your feelings just explode. You split and just… ruin shit.

Being kind is so fucking hard.

I sometimes don’t know how to go “I feel bad. That’s okay. There are no threats to my well being afoot.” I am unable to comprehend saying “they aren’t perfect. That’s alright.”",1,1733973943.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

Chant with faith:

I (29F) had a coffee chat with a guy (28M) for work that I intended to be fully professional. While he’s younger than me, he’s actually higher up than me and his career, but he works at a completely different company. I felt like the call ended up being very flirty, but in a way that was nice and I left thinking that he was a really great guy. I sent him a thank you note that evening and he responded within ~5mins saying if I needed help with anything to reach out. I added him on LinkedIn that night and he accepted quickly. 

On Monday (a week after the call) I messaged him on LinkedIn to basically shoot my shot and say thanks again, no worries that things didn’t work out with the opportunities at your company, but it would be great to grab a drink. 

3 days later and no response. I know his team made a big announcement for a win on Monday &/or it might be it’s the end of year crunch but I’m having anxiety that I’m being rejected — please help!?!

I started getting lost on my campus despite having lived there for two years. I had bouts of dream-reality confusion where I couldn't differentiate my dreams from reality. For example, a friend asked to meet for coffee, and I assumed I dreamt it so I didn't show (really, really severe to the point where I couldn't remember to go to my classes).

Then my stomach got paralyzed. I started vomiting daily. I started getting allergic/vascular reactions to random foods. I started getting episodes of tachycardia where my heart would shoot up to 200bpm even while sitting.

I ended up going home from college because I kept getting this impending doom - and it wasn't anxiety impending doom. It was similar to the impending doom that people describe right before they're about to die. I don't know how else to explain it, but there is a big difference between that feeling and regular anxiety/panic attacks.

For two weeks after that, I could not sleep. It didn't matter how many sleeping pills I got prescribed - I could not fall asleep, even after being medicated.

My neck also started getting really stiff, I could not turn my head - before things majorly took a turn for the worse, I did have a fever with a stomach bug paired with light sensitivity at college.

A week later, actually the day I was off to see the infectious disease specialist, my brain 'popped.' I don't know how else to word it. The world once looked clear, but all of a sudden it just didn't. I also started slurring my words.

I couldn't recognize my parents or my face in the mirror. I didn't know their names or mine. This went on for years - it wasn't brief episodes. It was long lasting and daily.

I did go to the ER and got told this was migraines or anxiety - I know for a fact it wasn't. It was like someone doused my brain in gasoline and took a match to it.

I still don't remember my high school years or the names of friends that I've had for ages.

I lay basically catatonic in bed for about two-three years afterwards, unable to talk, read, write, walk, or even know my own name. I had no sense of time passing (that's something I really struggle with).

My metabolic panels were also awful right before this (I got a diagnosis of isovaleric acidemia), but no one ever told me if my symptoms could be caused by that.

I ended up -overnight - with OCD, psychosis, and severe rage episodes after my brain 'popped.' I would blurt out the most random things. It was like I had no control over speech anymore.

I started having episodes where I would convulse and my oxygen levels would drop to the 80s.

I also started getting almost paralysis in the legs. I couldn't move them. To this day, they feel kind of numb to the touch.

A doctor from Cleveland Clinic put me on antibiotics as they thought it might be infectious (Lyme Disease) or encephalitis/meningitis. A doctor theorized I might have anti-NMDRA (I think) encephalitis, but I never tested positive - that was just a hypothetical as it wasn't their department.

I never had a lumbar puncture when it all started.

I do think I improved on the antibiotics. Some of my memories returned, (and some of them even pop back now) but I still struggle on a day to day basis with functioning and memory. I often forget yesterday.

MRI normal. CT scan normal. Save from having a paralyzed stomach, Hyperadrenic POTS, and some off metabolic panels, I was in perfect health.

Obviously I know this isn't a TBI. I didn't hit my head, but my brain still feels 'icky.' I don't know how to else to describe it - it feels clogged almost. I also get a ton of pain in the middle of the back of my head - that is chronic and daily.

I was 19 when it started, I'm 25 now, and I feel like it genuinely ruined my life.

I've seen every doctor known to man. I'm now going to see a neuropsychiatrist, but I'm worried she'll just put me in the munchausen category like the rheumatologist did. I'm not doctor shopping - I'm scared.",8,1733973224.0,ChronicIllness,6,1.0,False

Bitcoin users, we need to talk. Ever sent a Bitcoin transaction and found yourself staring at the blockchain’s equivalent of rush hour traffic?

Now im on a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan). If I dont get my shit straight im gonna get kicked out. But still im not worried. I tell my self this is gonna be easy I can get over this. And tell my self how much of a good job im gonna do but still catch my self not doing shit. It even gets worse that I move meetings 30 mins short notice before it start to the next day just cause i really dont feel like taking it today and mostly even missing the scheduled meeting which gets me into trouble. 

My Mom and Gf even thinks im just down bad lazy. I think so too cause ive been like this ever since I was a kid. But im not like this when im trying to learn stuff im really interested it. I even go best at the subjects I want to excel but find my self struggling on a routine.

I work and live where there is winter for like, six months out of the year. We get a fair amount of snow, and a fair amount of snow *storms* every year; we don’t get insane blizzards or feet upon feet of snow, but we get enough. 

My rant is, nobody can handle it anymore, but my question is also… could they ever? I don’t remember ever dealing with or hearing about businesses closing or people calling in to work for what is, by all accounts, typical seasonal weather. I literally never have, and I don’t say that as some dumb flex just… I learned at 16 how to drive in snow, and now I drive in snow, always have. I feel like you used to call in if you were in a ditch, and even then you’d probably call and ask a coworker for a lift. lol so I really do genuinely wonder: am I misremembering my childhood and young adulthood? Did people always call in to work all the time for snow? I’m not talking storms either; I had two call offs last week the night before, *before the snow started* because of the forecast. 

The final piece of this post: what do you do? We have a three call-in policy… but if a couple people call in for every storm I’m down to like three employees before January, so enforcing that in this case is kind of an empty threat. Am I awful for expecting attendance in winter?! I’ve had past employees imply we “didn’t care about our staff” when we didn’t close early or asked them to come in when it was… winter-ing. (Again, I don’t mean blizzards and extreme extreme weather. We closed for a legit blizzard two years ago. We haven’t had a storm like that since) Am I a toxic monster or are people out of their minds? Are we weaker? Is this just how things are now?!

1hcbiwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hcbiwh/possible_close_friends_to_dating_situation/,Possible close friends to dating situation?,"Sorry for longer post but want to explain our friendship as best as I can. I'm 23M, she's 23F. We both recently graduated university, I'm working in my home state while she's doing school another year in far away state.

We met during university through mutual friends. We'd see each other in group settings but didn't really know each other well. 2nd year spring semester, we had a few classes together and through that we became close very quickly. We'd talk & text a bunch, spend a lot of time together just us two (watching movies, getting coffee, eating lunch, going to parties together, etc.). I'd always thought she was pretty and as I grew closer to her I fell for her hard. She became one of my best friends though so I didn't want to ruin that. Anyways, there was one night where we were off dancing on our own at a party, she got too drunk, so I took care of her until her roommates could come help her. But even when they came, she wanted me to stay with her, so I did the whole night. That's when I thought things changed between us. So, after finding out her own friends thought she liked me, I asked her if she saw us as more than friends. She said not really and that she mentally cannot handle being in a relationship. Honestly I was shocked, I thought she for sure liked me considering her own friends did.

So, things were weird between us for a little while. We were still friends but not nearly as close. Luckily, our last semester (past spring), we had a class together and became good friends again. We began to talk a lot more and I'd see her a lot more than I used to. And since graduating, even though we're so far from each other, I feel like we've gotten closer. We ft every few weeks to catch up and she's the one who mentions we have to meet up when she's home (luckily she doesn't live far from me). And we actually did recently hang out for a day while she was home and we both had a great time. And she kept telling me we have to hang more while she's home for winter break and suggesting things we can do. Just for added context incase it helps, we've both never dated anyone before and I know I'm the only guy she talks to/is close with.

Anyways, I'm really happy just being close friends with her and I'm not trying to be more. But I'd be lying if I said that if she were to ever ask me out, I'd say no. So, I'm wondering if she might be starting to view me as more than a friend? Or am I reading too much into this?

TLDR; close friend & I used to be super close. Thought she liked me, she wasn't really sure. Grew apart for a while. Became close again and now even more so since university ended. Is she maybe starting to get feelings for me? Or am I reading too much into it?",1,1733972328.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1hcbdji,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hcbdji/i_problem_i_didnt_know_i_have_chapter_2/,I problem I didn't know I have - Chapter 2,"""Hi, Elie,"" my mom says as I walk into the kitchen. There’s someone sitting at the table, someone I don’t recognize.  

""Good morning,"" I say.  

""This is Mr. Kon,"" Mom says.  

He stands up and shakes my hand. ""How are you?""  

""Good,"" I answer hesitantly. ""What brings you here?""

My mom places a hand on my shoulder. ""Take a seat. I’m preparing some coffee, and I’ll have breakfast ready in a minute.""  

Breakfast? I normally just have a bagel with cream cheese before I head upstairs to start my workday. So why is she making me breakfast?  

I study the man more closely. Maybe in his late forties. His black hat, like a magician's hat, is on the table. He has a leather case next to the chair. Is he some kind of debt collector? Do we even have any debt? I’ll have the business debt paid off next month. Is my mom dating him? ""Gross,"" I mutter.  
But no, that can't be it. I take a seat, my face puzzled.  

""So, Elie, is everything okay with you?"" He asks, turning to me. ""I heard you had a business. Did you have to close recently?""  

I can’t bring myself to say anything. I have no idea what’s going on. This feels like an icebreaker. Is my mom trying to set me up with this guy?  

""I told Mr. Kon about your business,"" my mom says as she pours coffee and hands us each a cup. Then she places a plate with eggs and toast in front of me.  

""He can help you,"" she adds as she sits down.  

My eyes narrow. ""Help me with what?""  

Mr. Kon takes a sip of his coffee. ""I’ve helped many people with problems like this. There’s nothing to worry about.""  

""What problems? The business is closed, and I don’t want to reopen it.""  

""It’s not about that, Elie,"" my mom says. ""You haven’t been yourself lately. You’re not sleeping, you’re not eating well, and you’re not taking care of yourself. You’re angry all the time. This isn’t like you at all.""  

My eyes widen, and I feel betrayed by my mother thinking I have some sort of mental problem. I’ve never told anyone about my struggles. Why would she go out of her way to find a stranger and tell him I can’t sleep? How in the world did she find this person? He’s probably a con artist, maybe someone she met at church.  

I stand up. ""Mom, can you come with me, please?"" I say with a forced smile, managing to keep calm.  

I lead her out of the kitchen into the hallway. ""What are you doing?""  

""I’m trying to help you. You need help, and you never want to accept it.""  

""I don’t need help. I’m figuring this out. I’ll move on soon.""  

""How is it that the business has been closed for over a year, yet you still have all that stuff? You go down there, you look at it. You don’t sleep. I don’t know what’s going on, but this is all you think about all day. I bet.""  

""I don’t... I don’t..."" I sigh. ""Listen,"" my voice is low but confident, ""I don’t need help. There’s no problem. A lot of people don’t sleep. I don’t think this is a problem—it just happens sometimes. It’s not like I don’t sleep every day, and it’s not like I cry about it. I’m totally fine.""  

""Just listen to what he has to say,"" she says. ""I already paid him to come.""  

""You did what?""  

""Yes. He’s a therapist. Now go back in there because I’m paying him for the hour.""  

""I’m grown up, Mom. You can’t just force me to do things.""  

""Just give it a try. Do it for me. I’m really concerned about you. Just listen to what he has to say, and then we’ll never talk about it again.""  

I sigh. ""Fine.""

I think the conversations here are amongst the most thoughtful and respectful I've seen on any subreddit, so a sincere thank you to this community!

Now onto my ask: I booked a spontaneous trip to Bangkok for the month of March. On my radar are Sorn and Ore, so I'd love to know if one is strongly preferred to the other. Further:

1. Because this community is so amazing, if there are cheap recs that you enjoy please let me know! I enjoy doing high/low dining when I travel 

2. If anyone will be in Bangkok around those dates, I'd love to share a meal, night out, coffee, or conversation! 

3. I'm heavily debating whether to stay in/near Bangkok the full time or travel around Thailand. Aware the decision is a very personal one, but I would love thoughts if you feel strongly on this.

Get it why some folk toss ‘n turn inward ‘n check out,

means all the more their gonna give.

like finally letting go of the sweaty steering wheel. 

Understand it the beat downs that never let up,
feel it with every pride swallowing yes sir ok yup,
can be a dirty world swirling in a muddy coffee cup.

Searching for some safe haven,
for to unveil my real life face,
for the first time in a long time,
to be joining the human race.

Getting it good,
how bad it can be,
getting it,
getting it, 
got it sometime undercutting me.

What happens when the damn hurtin’ won’t heal,
when a body heart ‘n soul can’t help but to feel, 
like possibly popping prescriptions for a last meal.

Getting it good,

What happens when the damn hurtin’ won’t heal,

Anything goes from ranting about work/family to discussing/creating wild conspiracy theories, from sharing life stories to pictures of interesting trees/graffiti/anything else.

I can easily pick up a random topic to talk about, but my main interests include fitness, exercise, finance, and cooking. I love coffee, straight up black with nothing else (except water... Boiling water!). Dark jokes are welcome. I enjoy learning about people's life experiences and perspectives on different things. I'm genuinely good at listening too for when you need to vent. 

I'm open to all locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too 👻

Only had 1 meal and felt like I was going to combust on the way home. Went for a run and felt a bit better but just wondering if any one else experiences this? 

Edit to add: I check my blood sugar levels every week and it’s always fine, fasting and after meals. ",2,1733971514.0,Anxiety,1,0.76,False

I'm literally crying 😢 😭  rightnowwwww That place was a goddamn lifeline! Every time I was biking home or to work, it was my go-to spot for a cheap-ass drink or some decent food that didn’t completely wreck my wallet. And biking up Wisconsin Avenue? That hill is hell, but Wawa made it worth it. Now it’s gone, just like that? What the fuck is wrong with this city?

Wawa was the only place in Georgetown that didn’t feel like it was ripping me off. Not all of us have $400 to blow at some pretentious high-fashion boutique or $25 for a kale smoothie. Some of us just want a $7 hoagie and a $2 coffee so we can keep moving through our day without starving or going broke. It was a place for real people, not just rich assholes looking for overpriced nonsense. And now they’ve taken even that away. How the fuck are we supposed to get by when the only affordable, reliable spot in the neighborhood is gone?

First, they took Thaiphoon, the best damn restaurant in the city, and now Wawa? What’s next? Is everything going to be replaced with overpriced garbage no one actually needs? I’m so fucking sick of this city steamrolling over everything that matters to the people who actually live here.

This isn’t just a store closing it’s a slap in the face to everyone who relied on Wawa to get through their day. I’m done. Fuck this. What the actual fuck are we supposed to do now?",134,1733971451.0,washingtondc,40,0.81,False

I am hoping to get some renovations approved at a restaurant I have an interest in. I have three clear changes I want to make the site, and also a bit of advertising I would like to have visualised. I intend to provide four images (one per request) and some additional resources (e.g. furniture example, window example, inflatable example), and I hope for the outcome of each image to be returned with the described changes made.

Here are the four image requests:

|Image|Current Description|Change Requested|Proposed fee (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Outside of restaurant from the side, looking at a series of windows behind an empty paved outdoor area|Add an awning with a radiant heater and lighting to the side of the building, creating an indoor-outdoor space, and fill the paved area with outdoor seating and tables|$35|
|2|Inside the building looking towards a series of windows at the front of the restaurant|Add a coffee cart near the windows, replacing one fixed window with a sliding one (cafe take-away style)|$30|
|3|Inside the restaurant, looking at a series of windows towards the rear of the building. Current seating exists|Replace current seating with bar-style seating against the window facing out, and replace the fixed windows with open bi-fold windows|$30|
|4 |Outside, looking at the front entrance|Place an inflatable coffee cup on the roof|$20|

1hcb2eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1hcb2eo/family_drama_the_price_of_unconditional_love/,Family drama: the price of unconditional love,"
First time posting this, here goes.

At the age of 42, I've been told I am socially awkward when it comes to family by my cousin, who we'll call A. It's not Adam.

Before I became a first-time parent in 2022, I always put family first. The ""blood is thicker than water"" bullshit. I was like a milking ATM: flights to visit my sisters, cash gifts for every child they had, any event milestone—you could hear the ATM ringing. My sister got married, and I had to splash out that magic golden egg. Before I continue, let me explain that it wasn't about the gifts. They were expected to show respect in my culture (so fucking wrong), especially considering I was earning only £10.50-£11 per hour for six straight years with no pay rise.

Okay, back to the story. I have two siblings whom I've always tried to help whenever I could.

In January 2022, I became a first-time father. I raced to the hospital like Lightning McQueen when my son was unexpectedly born at 29 weeks (1.3 kg). When I finally brought my bundle of joy home, I expected my family to rush over with gifts and well wishes, but that wasn't the case. Once things settled down, I told my family the great news, but their responses were as lukewarm as a work colleague thanking you for a Zoom invite via text.

I paid for parking that night but parked in a residential area instead of the pay-and-display because it was 1:58 AM, it was dark, and I had bigger things on my mind. I got a parking ticket.

My son needed a tube to help him breathe, which scarred his vocal cords. The hospital was understaffed and overwhelmed. At night, his condition worsened, and he contracted NEC, a serious condition for a healthy baby.

Back to the story.

I received one gift: an embroidered name bathrobe for ages 2-3 from one of my sisters, let's call her B. My other sister, with all her kids and a bundle of my golden eggs, ghosted me on visits but demanded photos and updates as if she was part of my son's life. I tried to share the love at first, but my son's health issues took a toll.

My son spent his first two and a half years in the hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries. He still suffers from croup.

Fast forward to 2022-23, Sister B suggested meeting up to see the baby, but I declined. I wanted to protect my son's privacy, and I didn't want to expose him to the stress of hospital visits.

This December, Cousin A asked if I was going to visit Sister B on Sunday, but I declined because I was still on holiday. I later realized it was a big family gathering.

My upbringing was relatively normal, but I have a couple of siblings who are, let's say, unique.

When I asked my cousin why my sister hadn't reached out, he said I never attended family gatherings. I explained my reasons, but he seemed unconvinced. He even questioned whether she had invited me, which was impossible given my holiday plans.

I supported my cousin when he was struggling, but he now labels me as socially awkward. I'm trying to be civilized and explain that principles and respect matter.

I believe my son's privacy should be respected, and I shouldn't be judged for prioritizing his health. I've gone above and beyond to care for him, even using my annual leave.

Who gives a newborn a garment embroidered with their name for ages 2-3?

Sister A never made any attempt to visit, which is good for my bank balance.

Should I be brutally honest with them or play the happy family game?

Sister B has a good heart, but she's always looked down on me. She's constantly criticized my choices and achievements. Despite her judgment, I've managed to overcome obstacles and build a life for myself.

I feel like I need therapy and a strong cup of coffee.

I just want to be myself and let them assume what they want. My life is too hectic with a toddler to deal with their drama.

1hcb259,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hcb259/my_husband_has_always_wanted_kids_now_that_we/,"My husband has always wanted kids, now that we have one on the way, everything has changed.","Hi, I don't have many to talk to, for the last couple of years I have lost many friends. So l created this throwaway account to share something that has been very difficult for me.

I (29F) live with my husband (31M), we have been together for 5 years now and known each other for many more. People used to say we were meant to be as we were inseparable best friends for many years before we started dating.

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and I have been working as a barista for a few years. I was very happy with this job even though it didn't pay much. I had great coworkers and I love talking to customers.
My husband, lets call him Mike, has always knew what he wanted to do. Always had his entire life planned out. Something I used to find very attractive and I was happy to follow him everywhere and help him achieve his goals and dreams.
We have had a great relationship, until everything changed. Mike has been such a great guy, always eager to help out and has shown me what love truly is. I grew up with in a very complicated family that left me feeling unloveable, Mike has proved this to be wrong.
One of the things Mike has always wanted is kids. I have been on the fence about it all, afraid that I might not be a great mother and be able to love it as I should, purely because I wasn't very loved as a child myself. This has been a discussion for years. I have never said directly ""no"" to kids, yet I have expressed my concerns. Mike has always assured me that I would become a great mother.

Now, I am currently 7 months pregnant, I initially did not want to have this child as I did not have a great income and I honestly just wasn't ready. Mike on the other hand became ecstatic when I shared the news. I told him that I didn't feel ready and that there was so many other things I wanted to do before even considering having a child. This really broke his heart. He spent days trying to convince me that our economy is good (he has a very good job and gets payed very well), that I’ll be a great mother and that the timing will honestly never be perfect. So in the end I ended up keeping it. I also quit my job to be a stay at home mom, because we can live comfortably on Mike's payment and it was something that just felt completely right in the moment.

When I was around 4 months pregnant, a change happened in Mike. He became distant and ultimately just stopped helping out at home. He stopped cooking, which was usually something he did as he loved it, he started getting mad when I asked him to take out the trash or do anything else in the house. I ultimately stopped asking him for help because of his attitude towards me and how he increasingly became more and more angry.
I have always enjoyed doing chores as I love a clean house and I feel at peace when I do it. But being pregnant and having a lot of morning sickness and just exhausted all the time, I have really needed his help. For the past 3 months, I have done it all. Laundry, vacuuming, cleaning floors, done the dishes ect. During this time, Mike has withdrawn more and more, at this point all he does is get up, drink coffee without even talking to me, go to work, come home for dinner where he still won't say much and then just go to his office where he will either work, play video games or just watch youtube/ twitch.

I have felt so alone in this pregnancy that it has really started to tear at me. As I said, I don't have many friends and the ones I have lives many hours away, because me and Mike moved due to him getting a great job offer.

The biggest thing happened earlier this week. Mike came home late one night, he had been out with some friends and he was clearly pretty intoxicated. I asked him if he had fun, how much he had to drink and what they did.
This made him fuming, telling me that he doesn't appreciate being interrogated by me. I tried to explain that I just wanted to know about his night out and I honestly just wanted to show interest in his day.
He then started to yell that I was gaslighting him and that he can't even be with friends anymore. I started full on sobbing (damn hormones). He then yelled even louder that I was playing the victim, how I have ruined his life and many more hurtful words that I don't want to repeat. The one thing that really stuck with me was when he said under his breath ""you shouldve aborted it, you'll never be a good mom"".
This made me go into a rage fit where I yelled back at him, and tried to tell him how I have been feeling for the last few months. In hindsight, a bad time to take it up, but I was just so emotionally exhausted, angry and sad.
One thing lead to another and he picked up a lamp and chucked it at me, it hit my stomach and I have never felt such intense pain and fear in my life.
I ended up having to call an ambulance and left by myself, Mike didn’t even look in my direction when I left. Luckily everything looked good and they kept me for observation overnight just to be sure. Mike didnt show up at all.

When I came home, everything was cleaned, like nothing ever happened. On the kitchen sink there were flowers and chocolates with an apology letter. Still, Mike has refused to talk about the incident and has been keeping his distance. He leaves to work before I even get up and he comes back even later than usual, to the point where he just goes straight in the shower and then goes to sleep in the guest bedroom. Not even saying anything to me at all.

What do I do? It’s been a few days now and I just feel so unsure and overwhelmed. I cannot just leave him, as I’ll be left pregnant with nothing. We signed a prenup and basically everything is his, except for my car. I don’t have anywhere to live if I decide to leave and I no longer have a job.
The problem is that I don’t feel comfortable and safe about raising a child with him if this is how it’s going to be. I cannot let my child grow up in a broken home.

1hcb0ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/g_s_revengance/comments/1hcb0ow/new_commitment/,New Commitment ,"The arkonok steak that she had bought that very afternoon was almost ready. Kezale stood over her simple nano-wave stove, moving the heavy pan back and forth. Her home was simple, one bedroom and one bathroom with the living room and the kitchen being one in the same. Perfectly cozy enough for her, having lived there since she had moved out of home to follow her dreams and all that. Tonight it was not just going to be her however for she was having company. She had spent a large portion of the evening not cooking but rather cleaning because of that.  It was practically more pristine then the day she had moved in. The only thing that was not ready was herself.

There were several loud bangs on the old durasteel door and Kezale's heart skipped a beat, leaving her head spinning around quickly towards the door. He was early. She had only ever known him to be completely on time, never too early and never ever late either. Kezale still needed to do her hair again and put on the outfit that was still sitting unused on her bed. She looked back towards the darkness that was her bedroom. There was a light sigh,  hardly any time to think about any of that now. She began to approach the door, her bare feet making the wooden floor creak with nearly every second step that Kezale took. She made sure that her comfortable housecoat was buttoned up, with it wrapped firmly around her considerably small waist. She had reached the door when there was another knock, more loudly that time. Kezale pressed the button to open the thing and it slid into the wall with minimal effort, extremely quiet too, thankfully as she had only gotten it fixed recently. With a bit of help of course.

""Oh, my apologies."" The man, who was only a year older than her, said genuinely. Clearly referencing the second set of knocks. ""I hadn't the slightest idea whether or not one had heard me the first time.""

The Crown Prince of Onderon stood before Kezale on the assorted stone path that led up to her home. The neighborhood outside was unsavory, a single lane road separating the houses on either side of the street. Though it was much more like a massive footpath, nobody owned a landspeeder around here. Largely because few people had the financial means to do so but otherwise because everything in the community was so close together.  The only ones that ever came past were those belonging to the military and Tolvar's personal landspeeder, which took up a quarter of the road behind him. It was an open top craft with only two seats. One for him and one for the guard that stood behind him in plain clothes. Kezale found his piercing blue eyes unsettling to say the least. An elegant white blaster pistol with gold accents was sitting exposed from his coat. It would have been worth a couple months of her wages easily.

""You could have given me more time."" Kezale stated, leaning herself against the door arch. The outside world was so dead, nobody was normally out after dark unless it was very important. ""I would have looked so good to you.""

""Well... we could always drive about for a time and come back some minutes later."" Tolvar laughed, that jovial laugh that she had become so accustomed to. The one that she loved ever so much. ""No, truthfully, I wanted to come this afternoon ever so much after missing you at your performance this week. Unfortunately my royal obligations would not allow such a thing to transpire, I've only been allowed to slip away this past hour.""

""I understand. The only thing I care about is that you're here now."" She smiled, it was so thoughtful that he wanted to spend the whole night with her, even if it ended up not being possible. He rarely missed an opportunity to see her after a show but when he did he never stopped trying to make it up to her. She kissed him on the cheek facing her, staring into her eyes. Everything else seemed so distant, the guard included.

""You are ever so sweet, my dear. One must thank you for your understanding."" He returned the kiss, his head gracefully tilting down to perform the deed on her forehead. Before he knew it he was suddenly being dragged into the premises by both hands. His head turned the other way. ""Be a good sport and look after the landspeeder would you, Venjon?""

Venjon had not the time to nod to his charge before Kezale punched the button next to the door with her fist, shutting the door behind her lover. It was just them now, she knew that Tolvar preferred it that way. He had people that would lay down their lives for him, kill for him if need be but what Kezale and he had together was between them. Certainly not anybody from the Royal Palace. Tolvar had only acquiesced when his head of security had suggested just one guard for his more private ventures. The prince has handpicked Venjon because he was quiet, unlikely to let anybody know what he was up to. He appreciated it. Kezale began unhooking the chain connecting his flowing cape to his person, removing it before she hooked it back together and hung it on her coat holder on the opposite side of the door right next to her fur coat that Tolvar had bought. It felt completely natural to Tolvar, having his personal valet at the Royal Palace. It was different when Kezale did it however, much more intimate in a way that he could not explain with words.

""I cannot help but say that you always look good to me. One could never stress that enough if they tried,"" Tolvar took her gently by the wrist as she walked past him, gracefully spinning her around in his direction before he took both of her hands into his. Tolvar seemed far more open to talking about his feelings when the two of them were alone. ""Kezale, I would not have you any other way. Your beauty comes from your authenticity, that is what matters to me most of all.""

""Thanks. I think that you're pretty authentic yourself."" Kezale looked up to him, her cheeks blushing a bright red. He was a tall man as his sister was a tall woman. She could not help herself, perhaps she did not want to, as she pecked his lips. She had missed that, being with him. He had been so busy lately, all she wanted to do was to make this night special for them both. Part of the reason why she had wanted everything to be perfect earlier. ""I really should go check on how your dinner's going. Make yourself at home!""

""What is one having for dinner if one might be so inclined?"" Tolvar asked. He strolled over to the living area, his boots making the floor creak. It was a simple space with an upholstered two seat sofa and two modest armchairs. All of them were considerably dated and older looking, as was the coffee table between them that bound the space together. A small side table sat next to one of the armchairs. He elegantly sat down that chair as he threw his right leg over his left thigh, hands together in his lap while proceeding to lean back into the seat. Kezale had to let him buy her some new furniture, Tolvar thought. He would have her living like a princess if she so allowed him. The smell of the food was prevalent now with the door closed. ""Something to do with arkonok I must assume.""

""That's right, arkonok steak!"" Kezale knew that he had hunted it for entertainment before, he had told her that much, but she was unsure if he had ever eaten it like this before. The steak looked like it was almost ready as she pressed on one of her cupboards, the sizzle beneath being extremely notable while juices were shooting off into the pan around it. She took out a utensil, lifting it out of the pan after the stove had been shut off and onto a plate. ""They told me that it was freshly hunted, but I guess you'll be the judge of that.""

""A steak? That hardly sounds cheap, my dear."" A picture caught Tolvar's eyes as he spoke, one that he had not seen when he had last been around, sitting on the side table next to him. It was Kezale and her ballet trope, with her standing proudly dead center. Her auburn hair was firmly straightened. By the stars did she look skinny in her ballet kit, without her housecoat to offset it, many of the other ladies did too he noticed but she did especially. His vision shifted back to her in an instant. ""Surely you must allow me to reimburse you for such a thing?""

""No need, it's me that's meant to be treating you tonight. Not the other way around."" Kezale responded politely. He had a habit of doing that, offering to pay for things that she did not want him to. It did grow somewhat tiresome at times, but it was sweet to have somebody that cared about her in that way even if it was not always wanted. ""I need to be able to pay for the things I need to survive. Call it pride if you want.""

Tolvar seemed to drop the topic entirely, which seemed to please her.  Kezale took a bottle of wine out of the cooling chamber. It wasn't old or anything, in fact she had only bought it from the market that afternoon with the steak but she thought that it would be nice to give Tolvar at least some of the lifestyle he was accustomed to. She began to reach up to the upper most cupboards to grab a couple of glasses but there was already a hand going for it. Tolvar had stood up and strolled over to help, taking a glass with both hands. He placed them on the bench and Kezale poured the red liquid into them after screwing the lid off like a true team.

Tolvar picked up the plate with the steak on it, the divine smell penetrating his nostrils with ease. He could not wait to get stuck into it. He followed Kezale, who was holding a glass in each hand, towards the table. It was rectangular in shape, able to fold up against the wall when she required the extra living space. Handcrafted wooden chairs sat around it, two on both sides. Tolvar had gotten them for her too after she said something about one of the ones in her last set being unsafe, even matching the color her table was. They were so ornate, she loved them, but she would have preferred to get her own ones for cheaper even if they looked more ugly. Part of her liked buying her own things.

It was always awkward when she had to explain where her jewelry, fashion and even furniture came from. The girls in her ballet trope had some idea, they were always together after pretty much every show, but her family? She hated lying to them, a secret admirer. She was surprised she was still able to get away with that. There was so much in her home that he had bought for her.

""Well... I must say that it is my meal so it only seems right."" Tolvar had been wondering what Kezale had made herself for dinner but then he saw a salad sitting down in front of her usual chair. Needless to say he was worried, his eyebrow raising subtly. He could only come to the conclusion that she was not eating again. The topic of the conversation quickly changed as he pointed towards the salad. ""Is that all you are eating this evening My dear, surely you must  have more than that somewhere.""

""I....I'm not really hungry tonight."" Kezale placed the glasses on either side of the table for them both before she pulled out her chair and sat down, sticking her fork into her salad as she struggled to maintain eye contact with Tolvar. She never was a good liar, for as long as he had known her. ""I was out and about with a friend from ballet the other day and I had a really big lunch.""

""Kezale, when was the last time you ate a proper filling meal?"" Tolvar saw right through her, sitting himself down directly across from her. He used his fork to hold his steak in place as he cut through it with the generously sharp knife that Kezale had provided His movements with the utensils were as elegant as the ones he would use when dining with a foreign dignitary.  ""Dare I ask if it was the last time that we were together some weeks ago now.""

""I weighed myself after our lunch that day and I was over where my director says that I should be."" Kezale replied, taking a sip from her glass of wine. She was looking at Tolvar again now, her usual confidence returning as a result of finally telling the truth. ""This is only temporary, until I get back to that desired weight again. I promise.""

""Desired by you, or that insufferable director?"" Tolvar asked, devouring the piece of the steak that he had cut off for himself in a single bite. Tolvar could have that disgusting little man removed with the drop of a hat. As a patron of the arts, he had high level contacts in the ballet industry. He said nothing, however, not wanting to scare Kezale. ""What might happen when you make an attempt to perform those legendary feats of jumping you are so proficient at and your thin legs give out when you touch the ground during a show? I very much doubt he would simply let you keep your position.""

""That's never going to happen, promise. I've got the opportunity of a lifetime on my hands."" Tolvar knew better than anybody, aside from maybe her parents, that all she had wanted to do since she was a little girl was to dance. Her poor parents had invested so much into her, starting from taking her to classes as a child. Her practice was often more important then her going to school as she grew older. She grabbed something from her salad bowl, forgoing her knife for her hands, before she chomped it down. ""Hundreds, even thousands, are lining up to take my place. If I lose my chance, I'm never getting another shot.""

""My dear, you are slowly killing yourself. The only place that you will be dancing, if you continue not to eat, is in a grave. Is that truly what you want? Think of your parents, those who care about you. Would they desire to see you this way?"" Tolvar seemed deadly serious, deliberately blunt in his phrasing and demeanor only because he thought that Kezale needed to hear what he was saying. He cut another piece of his steak, holding it on the edge of his fork for a minute before consuming it. ""Please, just have a bite of one's steak. I implore you.""

""You've never even met my parents. How would you know what they think is best for me?"" When she saw Tolvar holding up that piece of steak, her stomach grumbled. It was loud, Tolvar could certainly hear it from across the table. Perhaps even Venjon could have if the door was open. She had been looking at the piece of food as a homeless person would look at a piece of bread. Kezale blushed embarrassingly but the jig was very much up. The ballerina seemed to relent. ""Fine, if it'll make the Crown Prince of Onderon happy, I'll have a couple bites.""

Tolvar's lips curled into quite the large smile. However as he was about to push his plate over towards the middle of the table Kezale pushed her chair out from the table, standing up as she began to stroll around the table towards his side. Tolvar pushed his chair out slightly, looking up at her as she stood over him the only way she ever could. She maneuvered herself between the table and his torso, sitting herself on his lap. Kezale grabbed the fork that she had been using, along with taking Tolvar's steak knife when he gave it to her to use. She cut a small bit off from the opposite side, the one that he had not been eating from, before chomping it down rather quickly. She was so hungry that she cut off another bit. It was just so tasty.

""My mother has become quite set on the idea of finding myself a wife as it were."" Tolvar started to caress Kezale's hair, his hand weaving gracefully through her curls as he leaned back into his seat to give her some extra room. ""I do not care for any of those noble families hurling their daughters at me for power after they fought so long to deny me my birthright. Oh if you could meet them, they are the most self serving individuals imaginable. I desire to make us official. Of course it will be a long road ahead but one has never been above hard work.""

""Are you sure that I'm not just some phase?"" She asked curiously. This was always meant to be a short term thing until he did in fact find himself a wife. She had come to terms with that long ago, even if she did not exactly agree with it. Kezale knew what he meant by a long road, that she would most likely have to give up dancing professionally eventually. She had never even thought of getting pregnant before, her career did not allow it. His father had been so accepted because he was a well known politician, but she was just a nobody in their eyes. Somebody that had seduced their Crown Prince some might say. ""I'm not exactly princess material, Tolvar.""

""My dear, that is exactly why I am so fond of you. I would not dare change a thing about you."" Tolvar said, planting a kiss on her cheek as he continued to run his hand delicately through her hair. ""Do you think I was born knowing how to be a prince? No of course not but one can learn all those procedures and things quite easily. However, nobody can simply teach somebody to have a certain personality. I want to be with you.

""I want to be with you too."" The words escaped her lips without her even realizing at first but she did not make an effort to retract them in the slightest. She dropped the utensils, wrapping her arms around the back of Tolvar's neck as she planted the longest kiss she possibly could on his lips, nestling herself into his shoulder.""

""Marvelous. Of course we must go somewhere publicly to celebrate our new found status, one week where you do not have to attend rehearsals. I can clear my schedule for the Council of Nobles easily enough, delegate my vote to a trusted ally so to speak."" He seemed to be deep in thought for a moment, his hand shifting from her hair to his chin. ""Have you heard of a resort world called Spira?""

She had not. Kezale had only ever been off world once as a gift from her parents after finishing her schooling but she did not care where they went together, only that they were in fact together. That was all she wanted, they could figure out the specifics later. Tonight all she wanted to do was celebrate with him.

1hcazji,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1hcazji/my_husband_has_always_wanted_kids_now_that_we/,"My husband has always wanted kids, now that we have one on the way, everything has changed.","Hi, I don't have many to talk to, for the last couple of years I have lost many friends. So l created this throwaway account to share something that has been very difficult for me.

I (29F) live with my husband (31M), we have been together for 5 years now and known each other for many more. People used to say we were meant to be as we were inseparable best friends for many years before we started dating.

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and I have been working as a barista for a few years. I was very happy with this job even though it didn't pay much. I had great coworkers and I love talking to customers.
My husband, lets call him Mike, has always knew what he wanted to do. Always had his entire life planned out. Something I used to find very attractive and I was happy to follow him everywhere and help him achieve his goals and dreams.
We have had a great relationship, until everything changed. Mike has been such a great guy, always eager to help out and has shown me what love truly is. I grew up with in a very complicated family that left me feeling unloveable, Mike has proved this to be wrong.
One of the things Mike has always wanted is kids. I have been on the fence about it all, afraid that I might not be a great mother and be able to love it as I should, purely because I wasn't very loved as a child myself. This has been a discussion for years. I have never said directly ""no"" to kids, yet I have expressed my concerns. Mike has always assured me that I would become a great mother.

Now, I am currently 7 months pregnant, I initially did not want to have this child as I did not have a great income and I honestly just wasn't ready. Mike on the other hand became ecstatic when I shared the news. I told him that I didn't feel ready and that there was so many other things I wanted to do before even considering having a child. This really broke his heart. He spent days trying to convince me that our economy is good (he has a very good job and gets payed very well), that I’ll be a great mother and that the timing will honestly never be perfect. So in the end I ended up keeping it. I also quit my job to be a stay at home mom, because we can live comfortably on Mike's payment and it was something that just felt completely right in the moment.

When I was around 4 months pregnant, a change happened in Mike. He became distant and ultimately just stopped helping out at home. He stopped cooking, which was usually something he did as he loved it, he started getting mad when I asked him to take out the trash or do anything else in the house. I ultimately stopped asking him for help because of his attitude towards me and how he increasingly became more and more angry.
I have always enjoyed doing chores as I love a clean house and I feel at peace when I do it. But being pregnant and having a lot of morning sickness and just exhausted all the time, I have really needed his help. For the past 3 months, I have done it all. Laundry, vacuuming, cleaning floors, done the dishes ect. During this time, Mike has withdrawn more and more, at this point all he does is get up, drink coffee without even talking to me, go to work, come home for dinner where he still won't say much and then just go to his office where he will either work, play video games or just watch youtube/ twitch.

I have felt so alone in this pregnancy that it has really started to tear at me. As I said, I don't have many friends and the ones I have lives many hours away, because me and Mike moved due to him getting a great job offer.

The biggest thing happened earlier this week. Mike came home late one night, he had been out with some friends and he was clearly pretty intoxicated. I asked him if he had fun, how much he had to drink and what they did.
This made him fuming, telling me that he doesn't appreciate being interrogated by me. I tried to explain that I just wanted to know about his night out and I honestly just wanted to show interest in his day.
He then started to yell that I was gaslighting him and that he can't even be with friends anymore. I started full on sobbing (damn hormones). He then yelled even louder that I was playing the victim, how I have ruined his life and many more hurtful words that I don't want to repeat. The one thing that really stuck with me was when he said under his breath ""you shouldve aborted it, you'll never be a good mom"".
This made me go into a rage fit where I yelled back at him, and tried to tell him how I have been feeling for the last few months. In hindsight, a bad time to take it up, but I was just so emotionally exhausted, angry and sad.
One thing lead to another and he picked up a lamp and chucked it at me, it hit my stomach and I have never felt such intense pain and fear in my life.
I ended up having to call an ambulance and left by myself, Mike didn’t even look in my direction when I left. Luckily everything looked good and they kept me for observation overnight just to be sure. Mike didnt show up at all.

When I came home, everything was cleaned, like nothing ever happened. On the kitchen sink there were flowers and chocolates with an apology letter. Still, Mike has refused to talk about the incident and has been keeping his distance. He leaves to work before I even get up and he comes back even later than usual, to the point where he just goes straight in the shower and then goes to sleep in the guest bedroom. Not even saying anything to me at all.

What do I do? It’s been a few days now and I just feel so unsure and overwhelmed. I cannot just leave him, as I’ll be left pregnant with nothing. We signed a prenup and basically everything is his, except for my car. I don’t have anywhere to live if I decide to leave and I no longer have a job.
The problem is that I don’t feel comfortable and safe about raising a child with him if this is how it’s going to be. I cannot let my child grow up in a broken home.

1hcavy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1hcavy2/bambino_x_baratza_encore_esp_having_to_grind/,Bambino x Baratza encore ESP having to grind EXTREMELY coarse (20+)?!?!,"I am losing my mind. I just got my first set up of a new breville bambino and a new baratza encore ESP. 
I did all the prep for the machine before pulling my first shot. I weighed out 18g’s of beans that were not new new but no older than a month old from an unopened bean bag from a local coffee shop. I ground them at the 15 setting in the encore. I used a WDT tool on the beans in the portafilter, using the *not* duel wall basket.  Tamped it with decent pressure, hit double shot and basically it took 15 seconds just to start dripping out individual drops of espresso very very slowly.

Cut to today, it’s been 4 days, I’ve tried every different version of pulling a shot and the only way I can get a shot to come out smoothly is grinding my beans at the 20-24 setting on the encore, which doesn’t seem right.

I spent an hour on the phone with breville and they said the machine seems sounds based on tests we did, but I just don’t believe that it’s normal to have to do a super course 20-24 setting on my beans in order to pull a shot. (The person on the phone was extremely nice but said that it’s normal to have to grind at 20-24 for espresso on the encore which breville technically owns) 

Breville very kindly is sending me different beans to try and see if anything changes but because I’m impatient I went and got new 15 day old beans at a specialty coffee shop today and pulled a shot and same issue arose, I had to grind extremely course.

It’s possible that I’m just misguided but something doesn’t seem to be adding up based on my research.

Why does it matter? There is a paradigm shift coming, are you ready? ","Greetings! I felt a tinge of excitement today as I saw the x-ray flux sharply rise into R2 levels only to find out it was on the departing limb from AR3912 and mostly  impulsive. I was hoping it was AR3917 or 3920 trying to give us some excitement but not today. The pattern continues. Flaring on the limbs with the occaisional moderate flare facing us, mostly impulsive, mostly non eruptive, and boring. I felt like I should get an update out anyway since its been a few days. It is also worth noting that the M6.4 from yesterday did produce a CME that may have had some earthward directed ejecta, but if so, not very much. Let's take a look.

**SUMMARY**

As noted above, solar activity remains fairly uneventful with the occaisional big flare but of the impulsive variety thus far. However, since 12/10 the x-ray has been quite a bit busier and has produced 6 solar flares between M1 - M6.7 in magnitude. This of course follows the X2 on 12/8 but from then until 12/10 the x-ray was quiet with a single M1 flare. So there is reason to be a little encouraged we may continue to see an uptick in activity, but temper expectations. AR3917 has decayed a bit over the past few days but is holding steady. AR3920 is putting on size quite nicely over the 36 hours with modest complexity and the result has been 6 C-Class flares and 2 M-Class flares in the last 24 hours. I really hoped that it was this region responsible for the M6 today. It's challenging to evaluate sunspot development without SDO. The GONG images we are using are not video and are taken several hours apart. As a result, the only way I can feasibly evaluate sunspots without a ton of legwork is on the [spaceweatherlive.com](http://spaceweatherlive.com) sunspot regions section where you can see side by sides of current and the days prior. It will do for now.

The 10.7cm SFI remains elevated despite modest sunspot activity so there remains an elevated baseline of activity but it just has not equated to flaring. Our coronal hole stream wound down overnight. Maybe coincidence, but as the effects subsided, the seismicity sharply declined back down to baseline levels with only 3 earthquakes over magnitude 5 in the past 24 hours after a few days between 8-20 M5+ quakes including some noteworthy shakes in Alaska, California, and Nevada among other places. We still have two coronal holes present which may cause some solar wind enhancement in the next few days, but the coronal holes we have now are far less imposing than the week prior. We have a few plasma filaments in geoeffective locations should they decide to erupt. Here is imagery and then your geomag forecast and something very cool

**GEOMAGNETIC SUMMARY/FORECAST**

The last several days have seen unsettled to active conditions primarily due to the coronal hole stream and reached active conditions (kp4) once in the last 72 hours. It is possible there were some minor enhancements from the eruptive activity that took place on 12/8 but they were not substantial to present as obvious in the solar wind data. As mentioned in the intro, it does appear that the M6.4 produced a CME with the possibility minor earth directed component as I will show you in the coronagraph below. Frankly its a stretch to even call it a halo, but we did see ejecta on both N and S of the disk. It was not modeled by NASA or NOAA as anything of note and I agree but just in case, I figured it best to tell you about it. CME Scorecard did receive some entries and they estimate Kp2-Kp4.

**Do We Really Know Aurora? Who the hell is STEVE?**

**I am about to blow your mind. Grab a cup of coffee..**

I read a very interesting article the other night and I feel compelled to share it with you. The article is titled [Sky Lights Called STEVE Are Challenging What We Know About Auroras](https://www.earth.com/news/mystery-lights-called-steve-are-challenging-what-we-thought-we-knew-about-auroras/) and is from earth.com. STEVE is not a traditional aurora and the acronym stands for ""Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement"". It was officially discovered in 2016 but likely existed long before it and was just never delineated from regular aurorae. Before I continue, I need to make it perfectly clear that we do not understand aurora comprehensively. This nature.com study sums it up very nicely in their introduction.

*""While the aurora has attracted attention for millennia,* ***important questions remain unanswered. Foremost is how auroral electrons are accelerated before colliding with the ionosphere and producing auroral light. Powerful Alfvén waves*** ***are often found traveling Earthward above auroras with sufficient energy to generate auroras, but there has been no direct measurement of the processes by which Alfvén waves transfer their energy to auroral electrons.*** *Here, we show laboratory measurements of the resonant transfer of energy from Alfvén waves to electrons under conditions relevant to the auroral zone. Experiments are performed by launching Alfvén waves and simultaneously recording the electron velocity distribution. Numerical simulations and analytical theory support that the measured energy transfer process produces accelerated electrons capable of reaching auroral energies.* ***The experiments, theory, and simulations demonstrate a clear causal relationship between Alfvén waves and accelerated electrons that directly cause auroras.""***

There is that name again. The godfather of plasma physics and the plasma universe. You would think at some point, when enough key processes are confirmed by modern science to be built around plasma physics that he would get the recognition he deserves and plasma universe theory would get the attention it deserves but I digress. Let me explain the above paragraph in simple terms. Where does the power come from? The aurora is not just light, its electric. A typical aurora is generting around 8 trillion watts per NASA. Let's get back to STEVE and we will revisit the regular aurora.

The question I commonly encounter from people is what's the difference? I see that it has my dad's name and that it is less common than regular aurora but what gives?

STEVE

* Often found in lower latitudes and outside the aurora oval and is a 25km wide ribbon of hot plasma around 450km up.
* Has a different color spectrum including white/taupe and presents either in a ribbon or pole like structure and often line up in rows called ""picket fence aurora""
* Aligned east-west
* Appear simultaneously in both hemispheres

This list will certainly grow. Ultimately we will never know for sure whether it has always been here in this form but as far as science is concerned, its known about it for less than a decade so the books are still being written as they say. The current held theory by most is that a ribbon of hot gasses breaks through the magnetosphere and into the ionosphere possibly causing nitrogen to interact with oxygen and form glowing nitric oxide. A secondary theory is that its caused by a SAID which stands for ""subaurora ion drift"" or polarisation jet. SAID is also an atmospheric phenomenon driven by perturbation and excitement of the magnetosphere and is also a narrow layer of east to west moving ions but it was not thought to be visible. Basically a really intense SAID is powerful enough to create an optical emission aka STEVE. I have to admit there are some solid points. Let's see what the latest theory has to say and why and I will let Claire Gasque Grad Student Berkeley and Brian Harding Assistant Research Physicist at SSL who co-authored with her say it in their own words from the article and then discuss.

*Gasque thinks that electric fields parallel to* [*Earth’s magnetic field*](https://www.earth.com/earthpedia-articles/earths-magnetic-field-origin-structure-and-impact-on-humanity/) *might be creating the picket fence colors.*

*Traditional auroras come from charged particles streaming down from space and energizing oxygen and nitrogen molecules, producing familiar colors.*

*But Steve’s purple or mauve tones do not match the pattern, and the picket fence appears in latitudes where auroras typically do not form. Gasque sees this as a sign that something else is going on.*

*Gasque’s research shows that a parallel electric field of about 100 millivolts per meter at an altitude of about 110 km could energize electrons enough to* [*produce the observed colors*](https://www.earth.com/news/steve-phenomenon-not-aurora-has-dawn-side-twin-swarm-satellites-discovery/)*.*

*She also points out that this region has special conditions, like reduced plasma density and more neutral atoms. This environment might allow the field to do its work without shorting out.*

*“If you look at the spectrum of the picket fence, it’s much more green than you would expect. And there’s none of the blue that’s coming from the ionization of nitrogen,” Gasque said.*

*“What that’s telling us is that there’s only a specific energy range of electrons that can create those colors, and they can’t be coming from way out in space down into the atmosphere, because those particles have too much energy.”*

*Instead, she said, “the light from the picket fence is being created by particles that have to be energized right there in space by a parallel electric field, which is a completely different mechanism than any of the aurora that we’ve studied or known before.”*

[*Brian Harding*](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/full-directory/name/brian-harding/)*, an assistant research physicist at SSL and a co-author on Gasque’s work, appreciates the significance of these findings.*

*“The really interesting thing about Claire’s paper is that we’ve known for a couple of years now that the Steve spectrum is telling us there’s some very strange physics going on,” Harding enthused.*

*“We just didn’t know what it was. Claire’s paper showed that parallel electric fields are capable of explaining this strange spectrum.”*

*The team plans to set their sights first on something called the* [*enhanced aurora*](https://www.earth.com/news/auroras-are-a-visual-warning-of-shocks-to-earths-magnetic-field/)*, which is basically this bright layer that’s embedded in the normal aurora.*

*“The colors are similar to the picket fence in that there’s not as much blue in them, and there’s more green from oxygen and red from nitrogen,” Gasque explained.*

*“The hypothesis is that these are also created by parallel electric fields, but they are a lot more common than the picket fence.”*

*“It’s fair to say that there’s going to be a lot of study in the future about how those electric fields got there, what waves they are or aren’t associated with, and what that means for the larger energy transfer between* [*Earth’s atmosphere*](https://www.earth.com/news/geomagnetic-storms-are-influenced-by-earths-atmosphere/) *and space,” Harding concluded.*

*“We really don’t know. Claire’s paper is the first step in the chain of that understanding.”*

I am sorry to drop so many words on you but if you have made it this far, you aint just killin' time so I will give you the full experience. She says it is time to question old assumptions and look for new answers. These are the people we need folks. They made a model of the ionosphere and tested the hypothesis and that is the beauty of electricity is that it scales so wonderfully. True to form, it generated the hues of STEVE and did so by the proposed mechanism. An electric current from the earth. Not from space. A new paradigm is being born. One where plasma physics and by extension electromagnetism will be given their due and with it, the crown, or should I say corona? Oh yeah, pun intended.

But wait...I told you I would get back to the aurora we know and love. Back to the original nature article about Alfven waves. The title is ""Laboratory measurements of the physics of auroral electron acceleration by Alfven waves"". They argue the following.

*Space weather embodies the study of how variable forcing by the Sun, mediated by the supersonically flowing solar wind, affects the near-Earth space environment*[*^(1)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR1)*. One of the most spectacular displays of the Sun’s effect on the Earth is the aurora, statistically appearing in an oval-shaped region around the magnetic poles at high latitude*[*^(2)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR2)*,* ***with manifestations on both the nightside and the dayside.*** *High-energy particles precipitating down along the Earth’s dipolar magnetic field into the auroral ionopshere collisionally excite atoms and molecules*[*^(3)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR3)*, leading to the auroral emissions with a variety of appearances, from bright discrete arcs, to faint arcs, to diffuse aurora.* ***The differing magnetic local time and morphology of observed auroral events suggests distinct source regions as well as differing mechanisms of generation, with a clear disconnect between dayside and nightside aurora***[***^(4)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR4)***.*** ***Three main magnetospheric drivers for the aurora have been identified***[***^(5)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR5)***: (i) the precipitation of very energetic magnetosheath particles from the magnetospheric boundary layer on the dayside***[***^(6)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR6) ***or plasma sheet electrons on the nightside***[***^(7)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR7)***^(,)***[***^(8)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR8)***; (ii) quasi-static, field-aligned currents***[***^(9)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR9)***^(,)***[***^(10)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR10)***; or (iii) energetic electrons accelerated by Alfvénic fluctuations, either as field-line resonances (effectively global-scale standing Alfvén waves in the Earth’s dipolar magnetic field)***[***^(11)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR11) ***or Alfvén waves propagating down the field lines towards the auroral ionosphere***[*^(12)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR12)*^(,)*[*^(13)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR13)*. For all of these cases, the detailed kinetic plasma physics governing the flow of energy from the outer magnetosphere into precipitating energetic particles remains a topic of ongoing study.*

I am going to greatly simplify that.

When a CME arrives at earth and interacts with the earths magnetosphere generated by the earths magnetic field and generates aurora propagating downward from both poles and the aurora manifests on both the night and day side of earth but it does so differently in magnetic time, source regions, and even mechanism. They go so far as to call it a disconnect. This is puzzling. They then outline the state of theory for aurora. There is particle precipitation that gets through the magnetosheath when a CME arrives that falls to the earth and is supposed to excite the gasses in the air making the colors. Simple gravity makes the particles rain down. They identify quasi-static electric currents aligned with the earths dipolar magnetic field or energetic electrons being accelerated by Alven waves within the magnetic field and mention Alfven waves propagating down the field lines towards the ionosphere which is earth plasma and electric. They note all are being pursued to their end but with no end in sight.

They then list all the evidence for Alfven waves forming in the magnetosphere due to the massive electromagnetic disturbance and then transferring energy down to the ionosphere to excite electrons forming the aurora. They can recreate it in a lab, they can make it work on the ol' spreadsheet, its backed up by observational data, not just on earth, but on many planetary systems. What it really boils down to is this. STEVE made people question whether particle precipitation alone could be responsible for generating such rigid and repetitive structures outside the auroral oval on both hemispheres at the same time and other researchers had been pushing the Alven waves theory to the limit and its passing every test. In that theory, the earths ionosphere especially when coupled with an excited magnetosphere is much more powerful than we would have thought. Their theories rest on field aligned electric currents from the earth itself. Its hard to tell just how far it can scale up. Remember how much energy I told you was in an aurora. The earth is VERY electric. We could see a major shake up in aurora science very soon.

You can't imagine what it means. Truly, it is not something that you just go ""eh, cool"" about and go about your day. This is a big F\*\*\*\*\*\* deal. Don't worry, because I am going to tell you why.

These people and mainstream science are way late to the party. They just had to take the hard way to get there, and boy I am glad they did. Let me tell you about Mr Anthony Peratt and the most commonly inscribed petroglyph in the entire inhabited earth with 100,000s of them on every explored continent. Mr Anthony Peratt is an old man now at 84 years old but was employed at Los Alamos as a plasma physicist. Mr Peratt is a disciple and grad student of Alfven. He is as qualified as a man can get. He noticed something very strange one day. The petroglyphs he had become so fond of had resemblances to his work in plasma physics. Resemblences is putting it too lightly. 100% morphologically similar is more appropriate. No chance coincidence. This glyph was inscribed in more rocks than any other, but there were many archetypes which were replicated in place after place. The owl, the spiral, the bird, the serpent were common, but this one stands out above the rest.

I am going to post this image from an article on [Medium.com](http://Medium.com)

https://preview.redd.it/bqcw9cnorb6e1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=be1bc69e9d1d2ca1833cbebdb1e5d3cb2abfda73

The top right two and bottom rows are from all around the world inscribed in rock around the same time and the top left two plasma rendetions by doing the exact same process the experiments in the article were doing. Its no mistake. It wasn't aliens. They saw this in the sky. It faced magnetic south and was almost universally found in sheltered places and were chisled deep. This symbol was adoped as a sigil for many tribes and peoples including the Carthagenians and the Dogon tribe of Africa today and has been featured in Graham Hancocks Ancient Apocalypse. This symbol held great meaning and the events surrounding it had profound impacts on the artists and people. I will link Mr Peratts video as I have done before. I will let you do the math on its significance and leave that for another write up. If you made it this far and you have understood what I have just told you, I commend you for your ability to digest a complex and nuanced subject and appreciate you hearing me out but I apologize if I have made you just slighhhhtly uneasy about how you feel about surging southerly aurora and new phenomena being discovered. Did our ancestors record ""enhanced auroral displays"" in the past on stone to be preserved for thousands of years in some cases? The evidence says yes. We now have confirmation from archaeology, the plasma lab, numerical calculation, observation, and logic to support that. The ubiquity of alfven waves, which he theorized but couldnt really observe at the time, is noted. Earth generated electric fields of unimaginable power is noted. Gravity having absolutely nothing to do with it is noted.

1hcarmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dawsonscreek/comments/1hcarmx/i_love_chatgpts_description/,I love ChatGPT’s description..,"Ah, Dawson’s Creek, the melodramatic coming-of-age saga where teenagers wax poetic like philosophy professors but somehow still can’t figure out how to process basic emotions.

First, there’s Dawson himself—King of the Whiny Cry Face. This guy had more existential crises over movie scripts than most people have in their entire lives. His biggest problems? Picking between his camcorder and deciding whether he wants Joey or Jen (spoiler: he fumbles both).

Speaking of Joey, did anyone ever tell her to take a break from the incessant pouting? She’s like the patron saint of repressed emotions. And her “will-they-won’t-they” thing with Dawson? They milked that plotline harder than the Friends coffee shop milk frother.

And Pacey, let’s be real: the “hot-for-teacher” storyline? Creepy. But somehow, Pacey still manages to be the only remotely likeable character, probably because he had the guts to ditch Dawson’s endless self-importance.

Jen? Oh, the classic “rebel girl with a tragic backstory.” Every time she got a solid storyline, the writers were like, “Nah, let’s make her life even worse.”

Add to all that the fact that Capeside is supposedly a tiny town, yet everyone seems to have endless drama on par with a soap opera. It’s like they stuck every Lifetime movie into one series and hoped we wouldn’t notice.

But hey, at least the theme song was catchy (even if Paula Cole’s I Don’t Want to Wait is now burned into our brains for eternity).",1,1733969945.0,dawsonscreek,1,0.67,False

**\~Who are we?\~**

We are the Evergreen SMP, a server started in late-August of 2023 on Minecraft Java. Originally, we were similar to SMP Earth but then we decided to change things up and created a server more about playing together rather than trying to start play wars. And now on the server there's an array of mod adding a bit of tech, bit of building stuff and a bit of other random shenanigans. So if you'd be ever so inclined, join us and become one of the Ever's in our community.

*Also we all mainly live in European or Australian time zones, so if you join outside of those time zones you might miss group events but otherwise you’re welcome to join!*

**\~Features\~**

* **Shopping district** 🛍️with coins and an economy
* **Together sessions**\- every other week we get together and play, chat, and have some fun
* **Progression map with 350+ quests -** basically the base game progression system in modpacks are wack so we changed that
* **Space-** yeah you can literally go to the moon, or build a bakery on Mars
* **Create mod**\- come on it's create you know what it is
* **Baking, wine, beer, tea, coffee, cheese, and restaurants-** there's so much food
* **New biomes**\- Nothing too extreme, the biomes feel very vanilla plus, and fit really well
* **Furniture**
* **New blocks-** Great for building
* **Heaps new storage options**
* **Bigger boats plus some planes**
* 16+ age requirement (average is 19-24)

**\~Our community\~**

We are constantly looking for input from our community to shape the server. In our community everyone has the chance to put a bit of themselves into the server.

Overall, as a community we respect each other and care about the enjoyment we gain from the server, while aiming to be cohesive and friendly.
