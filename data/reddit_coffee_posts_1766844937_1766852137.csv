1px1hb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1px1hb0/struggling_any_hope_welcome/,Struggling :( any hope welcome,"I’m 41 years old, and going through the most heart wrenching loss of my life and honestly dont want to wake up anymore.

I moved to Greece for my husband of 6 years. We had a beautiful small house in the mountains and 10 rescue cats who were my world. I learnt the language, integrated into the community, his family adored me, our lifestyle was simple but everything I ever dreamed of. and one morning 2 months ago we woke up and he ended it, just like that… i was on a plane back to uk that night and homeless sleeping on peoples couches. There is a lot more to it of course…. 

I have suffered with anxious attachment and working really hard in therapy - making big progress but he is fearful avoidant, I adored him he is the most beautiful human I ever met but whenever any emotion or conflict was displayed…. Or I showed how unsafe I felt with him having one foot out the door almost constantly… he threw in the towel. He told me that morning that he just felt stressed inside by my presence all the time, plus a couple of rows we had had of late…. I did feel I took all the blame. 

Our life was wonderful apart from this conflict… he is in therapy too but it didn’t appear to help him… he did fault find a lot with me instead of celebrating me and we had intimacy issues I caught him self pleasing while I was in the other room wanting intimacy… he once left me for 2 days after an argument about how much that hurt me. 

I suffered infertility for 4 years, had an operation to fix the issue then he immediately stopped trying…. So Im now grieving a life without children and a husband as Im going to be too old to try again. I know Im not showing him in a great light but the good times were magnificent, I never clicked with a person like that before and doubt I can again. I feel like there’s no point in living this life. Out of a suitcase too ill to even begin to look for full time work to then probably gave to rent a fucking room in someone else’s house if I can even manage that…. life feels unbearable. I used to wake up and see sail boats on the sea every morning, drink coffee together looking at the mountains, hiking together, eating and cooking beautiful natural food for friends, i just adored being with him wherever we were.  I regret acting out sometimes out of feeling insecure.


6 years…. Now having to adjust to life in a country I hate, staying in scruffy damp houses, busy traffic, shit food, I hate it so much and cant afford to live here while grieving, battling crippling anxiety adhd and not having a comfortable place to stay. 


When we met he came accross as everything i ever dreamed of, emotionally available, kind, compatible, same future goals. I loved him entirely. Our love story you could write a book about. Everything changed overnight and I miss my world there, I miss my darling cats, I miss him all day. I can’t hardly eat. I went from sitting by the sea every day to this hell. Yes Im on medication Valium and lexapro but it doesn’t help much. How do I even start to feel ok, or will I ever again? I’ve lost access to safety totally.

1px1g0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1px1g0z/concerned_about_my_mom_could_this_be_spiritual/,Concerned about my mom - could this be spiritual psychosis?,"I’m not asking for a diagnosis, I’m mainly looking for advice, thoughts, or similar experiences. 

My mom has a long history of trauma and abusive relationships with men. Most recently, we moved again after she broke up with another abuser. After this move, she initially seemed stable and was attending school.

Before everything escalated, she was working in massage therapy. During that time, she had an interaction with another employee where she asked him what was wrong. He said nothing was wrong, but she insisted she could sense that something was. When he asked how she knew, this seemed to reinforce her belief that she could intuitively read people. After this, she became increasingly convinced she had the ability to sense energy and read others.

Shortly after, she quit her job and went through a period where she was unemployed for several months. During this time, she did not really provide for us and became extremely focused on spirituality. This period almost felt like an “episode,” where she withdrew from normal responsibilities and daily life. Her beliefs escalated quickly and appeared very suddenly. She had never been spiritual before. She began describing what she called a spiritual awakening and became consumed by it. At the beginning, she would rant daily for very long periods to me and my siblings, repeating the same ideas and stories over and over again and telling us that we needed to “wake up.”  She was on the phone ranting to everyone else as well, for hours and hours on end everyday. 

At first, she believed there were demons or evil spirits in our house. She said she could see them, allow them in, or keep them out. She hung crystals on the walls for protection and claimed the spirits were responsible for things like a leak in the ceiling. Later, she stopped talking about demons and said they were actually manifestations of her past trauma, but her beliefs continued to change rather than resolve. She also mentioned that she met her ancestors through all of this. 

Around this same time, she met a black man and believed she had lived a past life as a Black girl because of a dream she had, and that this explained why she was connected to him. That relationship did not work out, but afterward she continued to believe in twin flames, reincarnation, and spiritual soul connections. The person she believes she is spiritually linked to has changed multiple times.

She believes there is a spiritual mirror between her and her twin flame, whoever he may be, and that she can feel his emotions, such as fear. She believes her current life circumstances are the result of her past lives.

She believes she has spiritual gifts, including sensing energy, reading people, and interpreting signs. She believes nothing is a coincidence. She always say that things are shown to her. She assigns meaning to nearly everything, birds she sees outside, repeating numbers, license plates, songs on the radio, vivid dreams , ringing in her ears (which she experienced especially in the beginning), animals’ behavior (including believing our dog growling was caused by her energy), people wearing similar clothes (for example, seeing multiple people wearing plaid and believing it was a sign), conversations she has with people, etc. 

She believed that a license plate number confirmed she was going to marry Dermot Kennedy, and she made my brother text her a witness statement about it. She and a friend also believed that their coffee was moving on its own, which reinforced her belief in spiritual forces.

She believes songs contain direct messages meant specifically for her, and that her dreams are prophetic signs. She constantly googles or uses ChatGPT to find the spiritual meaning of everything, and fully believes whatever interpretation she finds. I feel that using ChatGPT has made this worse, because she can look up the spiritual meaning of literally anything and then treats it as confirmation.

She believes society itself is changing for spiritual reasons. When a virus was going around she said people are getting sicker because they are not spiritually awake. She believes the growth of the LGBTQ+ community has spiritual meaning and is part of something larger happening in the world. Basically anything going on the world currently, is linked to everything she believes in. 

She often says things like “You guys will see what’s coming"", ""Soon you’ll know I’m not crazy"", ""Soon you’ll see that I’m right.”

Her sense of purpose or “path” keeps changing. At different times, she believed she was meant to pursue massage therapy, then it was to run a podcast, then do humanitarian work, then it was to give a TED Talk, now it's to write a book. 

None of these have actually been completed. She was once on a podcast about her journey as well, but later rejected it and changed her beliefs again.

Over time, the constant ranting slowed as the awakening felt less “new,” but spirituality is still the only thing she talks about. She is not emotionally present anymore. She forgot my birthday and my sister’s birthday. I can’t go to her for advice or have a normal conversation because everything somehow circles back to her beliefs, and it doesn't feel like she's ever 100% listening when I talk about things. 

 She stopped celebrating holidays, including Christmas. Last year, she said we didn’t need a big Christmas because something major was going to happen and we would be “blessed” with a big vacation. That never happened. Towards the end of this year she is actually struggling pretty badly with money.

She announced publicly on Facebook that she no longer believes in Christmas and refused to attend family Christmas gatherings.

Overall, this came out of nowhere and completely took over her life. Her beliefs continue to shift, but the fixation remains. She no longer feels present. I’m struggling to understand whether this is truly a spiritual awakening or some form of psychosis.  ",1,1766851854.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

We’ve all hit up the malls, Sector 18, and Brahmaputra Market a million times, but Noida has some seriously underrated hidden gems that feel like a mini escape from the concrete jungle. Sharing my top favorites – perfect for weekends, solo chills, or low-key dates. What’s yours? Drop in comments!

1.  Okhla Bird SanctuaryRight on the Yamuna, this place is pure peace. Early mornings (especially in winter) = hundreds of birds, walking trails, and zero crowd. Entry is cheap (~₹30), and it’s amazing for birdwatching or just sitting by the water. Way better than any crowded park!

2.  Surajpur Bird Sanctuary / Wetlands (Greater Noida side)Even quieter than Okhla. Super green, great for walks or cycling. Saw flamingos last winter! Feels like you’re nowhere near the city.

3.  Teasta Tea Shop (Godavari Market, Sector 37)Tiny spot with the BEST masala chai and Maggi. Super affordable, always packed with locals. Hidden in the complex – if you know, you know.

4.  Quiet cafes in Sector 104 / 120 areaPlaces like some cozy hidden cafes with greenery and no loud music. Perfect for WFH breaks or reading a book with coffee. Way less crowded than Sector 18 spots.

5.  Botanical Garden vibes (Sector 38A area trails)Not the super famous ones, but the lesser-known walking paths with lakes and greenery. Sunset views are 🔥

Bonus: Some street food stalls tucked in smaller markets (like Jaipuria or Advant) that serve killer momos/rolls without the Brahmaputra chaos.

I was still buried deep under the covers when she suddenly pounced, pinning me to the mattress with an intensity I haven’t felt in a decade. I was totally trapped and breathless as the wet kisses started coming fast and heavy. For a split second, my heart raced thinking the ""talk"" had finally worked and I was actually being desired again.

Then reality hit….It wasn't my spouse finally initiating; it was my kibble craving Golden Floof deciding that 6:30 AM is the new peak time for a full-contact wrestling match and a face-licking marathon…

Still, it’s a nice change of pace to be someone's first priority, even if I'm just a glorified treat-dispenser who's ""good at walks"".

But...holy hell, those karaoke boats going up and down the Mekong? When did that become a thing? Why have the (presumably very conservative) local government not put a stop to it?

It is so obviously ruining the vibe along the riverfront. A particular shame as it is very picturesque and now filled with nice coffee/beer or food venues to relax in.

“We’ve always grown through referrals.”

That works… until it doesn’t.  
Because referrals don’t show up when things slow down, when seasons change, or when someone needs a service *today*.

What feels like a sales problem is usually a findability problem.

Customers aren’t asking neighbours like they used to. They’re pulling out their phone and searching “near me.” If Google can’t clearly see that your business is active, trusted, and open, it quietly sends that customer to someone else.

Your Google Business Profile has replaced hallway conversations and coffee-shop recommendations.

60-second money-leak check (no tech talk):

* Search your service + city/town. If you’re not near the top, customers aren’t ignoring you, they don’t know you exist.
* Look at your last review. Months old? That tells Google and customers you’re not being chosen.
* Check your hours, photos, and services. Anything outdated creates hesitation before the call.

This isn’t marketing hype.  
It’s basic trust and visibility.

Ponder this:

**Deep Pixel Melancholy** is a visual novel about being stuck in a time loop inside a gray, soulless city.

Egor’s life is like a stuck VHS tape: utility bills, the same trolley bus to the office, endless paperwork, 3-in-1 instant coffee, and chronic exhaustion. He dreams of the sea, but let’s face it, hell will freeze over before he can afford a vacation.

His routine is shattered when he discovers he's stuck in a time loop. Trying to make sense of it, he’s forced to face the real question: Why bother escaping at all? Tomorrow doesn't bode well, and maybe a single carefree day is all he needs to be happy.

*Details:*

* *animated pixel art full of early-2000s nostalgia*
* *a slow, snowy city vibe — wrap yourself in a scratchy blanket and watch as the snow erases the streets, while shadowy silhouettes drift under the streetlights*
* *an introspective story about a worn-down guy trying to make sense of the world around him*
* *lots of mini-games and environmental interactions*
* *narrative choices leading to multiple endings*
* *a haunting northern aesthetic of slowly decaying beauty.*

The cards glided from the ordinator’s hands into the senator’s spindly fingers. The wiry man peeled up a corner. His eyes still behind his wire-rimmed glasses.

“Raise two,” Ren Haiat said. The tall young man sank back into the chair with a feline relish. He ran his fingers through his dark hair and smirked at the third player. The senator’s daughter.

*Something decent.*

Her foxy green eyes darted to her father. To Ren. To her cards. To Ren.

*Faking weakness.*

“Call,” she replied.

“Call,” the senator said instantly after.

The ordinator’s hand slid across the table, revealing the Gold Ten, Silver Queen, and Iron Nine.

“Check.”

“Check.”

“Check.”

Next came the Iron King.

The senator tapped his fingers and glanced at his two protégés. “Check.”

“Raise four,” Ren yawned.

“Call,” the daughter said after a slight thought.

“Call,” her father joined.

Finally, the Silver Deuce.

The door slammed open. The household’s dispensator burst forth, expression red.

“Ren Haiat! Donella Hartsforth and her father are in our atrium, demanding your presence.”

Ren smirked. “Tell her I’ll see her again at the Noman’s Pomerium Gala.”

The dispensator tore the lounging young man from his seat. “You’ll explain to her father why he should not publicly condemn you, you…you—” The older woman seemed to be at a loss for words.

Cornelia glared at her father. “You still think he deserves Maddeus? That’s the third girl this month.”

“Raise twelve,” her father replied.

*He thinks he can bait her.*

“All in,” the girl replied instantly, no longer needing to maintain the facade.

The senator had the copper and silver kings, a triumvirate. Cornelia produced the copper and silver jacks. A straight.

He gave his daughter a smile and wrapped her in a one-armed hug. “Well done, Nel.”

The ordinator’s eyes watched the senator leave. He would now have his evening coffee for the next half hour. This was his chance.

“Marvelous dealing.” Cornelia flashed him a bright smile. Aurian’s face flushed; he gave a polite nod. Her smile was for the ordinator, not him.

“Congratulations on the last win, Ms. Maddeus. You do seem to get the upper hand of your father in Saba these days,” Aurian replied offhandedly. His hands swept through the table, picking up the cards.

He palmed Ren’s cards, peeking at the corners before they disappeared back into the deck.

The Iron Ace. The Iron Jack.

  
\---



“Enter.” The senator’s voice seeped past the heavy oak doors.

His eyes showed surprise when Aurian walked through, but it didn’t make it onto his face.

The man’s office was bright, the wall behind the senator’s marble desk almost entirely glass. The walls were a shade of pale light green that would have looked mellow in another room, but here shone brightly in the reflected light.

Aurian was reminded of being inside a tree in the summer sun. It made for a light atmosphere if you discounted the intense aura radiating from the senator.

A senator of the greatest nation in the world. More than three hundred million citizens backing his strength. His auctoritas was more than most so-called kings ruling over their handfuls of victims.

The man had suppressed it during the game, perhaps not trying to intimidate the other two players. He afforded Aurian no such courtesies. A senator had an image to maintain.

“How may this old man help you, my boy?” Maddeus said with a smile. The man was in his mid-fifties but looked barely in his forties save for his grayed hair.

“Senator, I have worked for you as the ordinator of your games for four years now. Have I acted to your satisfaction?” Aurian said, fighting to hold the man’s gaze.

The older man gave him an amused smile, used to hearing requests. “Of course.”

“And my grandmother?”

“A great aide in our library. One of the best.”

“As your ordinator, have you ever suspected I may cheat you?” Aurian asked with a slight gulp.

The senator’s eyes narrowed. “Of course not.”

“Then as you trust me, Senator, I request you consider my proposal.”

The senator’s eyes relaxed. “Go on.”

“You know about the warehouses in the western port? For unloading ships from the harbor. But maybe a quarter are long-term storage.”

Aurian looked at the senator’s face, then continued.

“They hold copper. I believe it’s part of the Republic’s national reserves.”

The senator nodded.

His face was still placid. Too placid.

*Too late to back out.*

“There’s a gang—Of course, I have no involvement with them, but I have friends. I hear things. A member of the Vespers faked an ownership certificate of one of the warehouses. They invited over a republican requisitioner from a faraway province, Etrea. The requisitioner bought up the copper for the Republic’s reserve. Now the Republic thinks it owns two warehouses full of copper. But it’s the same one.”

The senator gave him a smile. “Thank you for telling me about this. I will get some lictors to verify this.”

Aurian continued. “I thought it was strange. Surely it couldn’t have been that easy to defraud the state. I requested ownership records of the Etrean reserves. It’s public information. It took a while, but when I got them, it was…revealing. Very little of the Etrean reserves were actually in Etrea. Much of it was in Drova. The same warehouse I mentioned before was listed three times under different names.”

Aurian waited for the senator to say something, but the man stayed silent, staring at Aurian blankly.

“I then requested records from every single province. All twenty-seven. I have only gone through a few. But, sir, I believe the Republic’s copper reserves are a fraction of what we believe they are. I have found dozens of listings of what look like the same reserve. The warehouse in question, from before, was listed in the records of eight other provinces.”

He handed the report he had compiled to the senator. Maddeus flipped through the pages, looking at Aurian’s notes alongside the copies of the official records.

“That is remarkable, Aurian Kamodus. We will need further confirmation, of course, but your work is sufficient for now. The senate must be informed at once,” the senator said, his voice carrying the appropriate amount of astonishment.

The hair on Aurian’s arms raised. He rushed to speak.

“There’s another copy of the report.”

The senator didn’t comment. Aurian hadn’t wanted to say it. It was so crude and untactful. It was always better to start a relationship based on trust. But the hairs on his arms were still up.

“We need to tell the senate, of course. But before that, I have an idea to help House Maddeus,” Aurian continued.

“How so?” Senator Maddeus seemed genuinely curious.

“The mining corporations, and sometimes banks, sell insurance contracts to shipyards. I’m sure you know a significant portion of an airship’s cost is simply the copper and aluminum that makes up the hull. Shipyards are paid in fixed-price contracts to produce a certain number of ships, or a single capital ship over, say, three years. But over those years, the price of materials may change. A spike in the price of aluminum or copper could turn a project unprofitable.”

“Yes, I know this, boy. They purchase insurance contracts to acquire the materials at a fixed price for the duration of the project,” the senator interrupted.

Aurian forced a smile. “Exactly.”

There was a moment of silence.

“You mean to—?” This time the senator’s expression of shock was not manufactured.

“I only wish to help you, Senator.”

The man stared at him in a moment of disbelief before laughing.

Hands on his desk, fully belly-laughing.

“Oh my. Boy, you are certainly a surprise. Maybe you should have been playing today, while I dealt the cards.”

“Have you done any calculations?” Maddeus asked.

“Yes. It seems to be normal to get two- to three-year contracts at the current market price for ten percent of spot. But if you price the contract at above spot—say, twenty percent above—you can get the contract for as low as half a percent of spot. If the price rises fifty percent after the news breaks, we can make sixty times our initial.”

The man got up and draped one of his long arms around Aurian’s shoulders.

“I am glad you came to me with this, young man.”

“I would like ten percent of the profits.”

The senator laughed harder.

“You certainly don’t lack gumption.” The senator wrapped him in a full hug.

“Five percent. This plan of yours, as ingenious as it is, can only work with my resources.”

“That’s unfair.” Aurian pushed his luck. “Think of how much we can make. I have all the records already. You can buy the insurance. Then send my written report to every press in the country. The price rise will be astronomical.”

The senator mussed his hair.

“My boy, you are forgetting a few things. If your information really is true, I will be purchasing the insurance, risking my marks. I will do it through intermediaries, but it is my reputation on the line. Second—” He chuckled. “The senate will be outraged. The gentlemen who sell us the insurance will have many senators speaking on their behalf. Fraud, they will claim. If you were to try it on your own, no doubt you—a hapless twenty-year-old—would be blamed as the mastermind behind the actual missing copper. Without me generating the political support, the contracts would be null and void.”

Aurian’s face went white. “Ah” was the only thing he could think to say. Aurian didn’t expect to be taking out enough insurance for the gods damn senate to get involved, but clearly the senator was thinking on a different scale.

“So, boy, five percent is actually quite generous. And it will be contingent on a few things. I would need to fold you into my household as an official client. Can’t exactly have you as a political enemy in a decade.”

Aurian didn’t comment on the senator’s alacrity to close the deal.

“I would be honored.”

The senator worked out the details of the deal, tying Aurian’s fortunes and any future political ambitions to his own. It was more than fair.

“It’s a shame you are leaving for the Pomerium so soon, Aurian. I would have liked to get to know you better,” the senator said as he finally let go of Aurian’s shoulder. The man had dragged him all around the household while working out their arrangement. The staff, Cornelia, and even Ren had given him a double take.

“The loss is my own. I will look forward to returning every day for the next three years.”

“You must join us for dinner from now on, of course. And accompany Nel and Ren for the flight to the Pomerium. I know you three will accomplish great things. I’ll have the arrangements made. I will unfortunately have to leave for business tomorrow. By the time I get back, you three will be gone.”

Aurian agreed, promising to return for dinner.

He slowly walked out of the mansion gates. It had gone better than he could have hoped. The senator had adopted him into his family. Not as a son, of course—maybe in the future if he placed high enough in the Pomerium—but just a client for now.

But the good fortune was not what was on his mind.

*The senator already knew.*

Aurian had felt like a genius when he sold the warehouse of copper he didn’t own.

He wondered how great the senator felt, selling it over and over every month.",1,1766851161.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

We’re 30.

I’m trying to figure out if I’m being overly sensitive or if this would bother other people too.

The guy asked me out and we met at Starbucks. Right off the bat, he did this thing that already annoys me. He kept asking which Starbucks to go to, multiple times, even though we have been to the exact same one together before (in our childhood town - and it's a 5 minute walk from his parents' house!).

He got there ONE minute before me and told me he already ordered his coffee on the Starbucks app. When I arrived, I got in line. He then tried to sound gentlemanly and said, “Oh, I can order for you on the app!” I said it was fine and stayed in line. At that point, he didn’t wait with me or stand nearby. He just went and sat down at a table.

After I ordered, I joined him. A few minutes later, his drink was ready. He got up, went to the pickup counter, grabbed his coffee, and came back (took about 30 seconds). He didn’t even glance at the counter to see if mine was ready (it had my name on it), let alone try to grab it. As soon as he sat back down, I went up to grab my coffee.

I know this sounds small, but it rubbed me the wrong way. If roles were reversed, I would have waited for him before ordering (or actually ANYONE I'm meeting up with) before ordering - and if he was late, I would've texted him to ask him what he wanted (and ordered for both of us). It wasn’t about buying me coffee. It was more about awareness and basic courtesy.

Is there an unspoken rule of waiting for your date to arrive (no matter how long you've known them for) before ordering?

Hey r/OffGridTech,

Wanted to share real-world data from our 45-day winter test of the Jackery HomePower 3600 Plus. We got lucky (unlucky?) with an actual 19-hour power outage during testing at 5°F ambient temp.

**What we powered during the outage:**

* 18 cu.ft. refrigerator (120W)
* Gas furnace blower (600W cycling)
* LED lighting (40W)
* Phone/laptop charging (65W)
* Coffee maker for 8 minutes (1000W)

**Runtime: 14.5 hours before we started solar recharging**

At 9:30 AM (grid still down), deployed 800W of solar panels. Despite 28°F temps and intermittent clouds, we got 680W average input and recovered 2,040Wh over 3 hours.

Grid came back at 6:15 PM with battery still at 46% (1,649Wh remaining) = could've run another 11+ hours.

**Other notable test results:**

**Extreme cold performance:**

* Garage storage at -12°F overnight - no issues
* Self-heating activated automatically at 32°F
* 92% capacity retention at 5°F

**LiFePO4 battery longevity:**

* 6,000 cycles to 70% capacity vs 500-800 for lithium-ion
* 25 cycles during our test = 98.7% capacity retention

**Solar charging (worst-case December):**

* 9-hour daylight days in Northern Michigan
* Battery never dropped below 85% over entire month
* Overcast days: 200-300W generation
* Sunny days: Full recharge in 3-4 hours

**TL;DR:** If you need legitimate home backup without generator maintenance/noise/fuel, this LiFePO4 unit delivers. Premium price but the 10-year lifespan justifies it for serious use.

Happy to answer questions about the testing or specific performance metrics.

The 2nd scenario seems unlikely to me bc i feel like it would feel kind of insulting for the rejected party if it wasn’t mutual. 

I’m asking bc i went on a ‘coffee date’ pre - hookup which was really nice b/c me and they guy hit it off socially but I didn’t find him all that attractive he wasn’t bad looking but it was something about how he carried himself, I just didn’t find him sexy. Then we went to hook up but the kissing was so bad that i knew it would be downhill from there so I made up an excuse and left. However me and the guy hit it off socially really well and had a lot in common. I sent him a text the nxt day saying the chemistry wasn’t there for me and wished him luck. It got me thinking that if we had met in a different context that we could have been good friends but now I’ll never see him again.

1px0xwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1px0xwi/i_arrived_too_early_for_my_flight/,I Arrived Too Early for My Flight,"The boarding announcement never came.

That was the first thing I noticed when I woke up.

I’d curled into one of those stiff airport chairs, backpack hugged to my chest, the red-eye still hours away when sleep finally dragged me under. The terminal had been loud then—wheels rattling, tired laughter, a baby crying somewhere far off. Normal. Safe.

Now there was nothing.

Not silence exactly. Airports never truly go silent. The lights hummed overhead. An escalator clicked endlessly, going nowhere. But there were no voices. No footsteps. No coughing, no announcements bleeding through cheap speakers.

Empty.

Every seat in the terminal was vacant. The coffee shop shutters were down, metal teeth locked tight. Departure screens glowed a sickly blue, frozen on the same time: 02:17 AM. My phone lit up when I checked it.

No Service.
02:17 AM.

I stood, my footsteps too loud, echoing wrong, like the building was listening. I called out—“Hello?”—and immediately regretted it. My voice didn’t travel far. It felt swallowed.

I walked toward security. The ropes lay coiled on the floor like shed skins. The scanners were dark. Beyond them, the terminal stretched impossibly long, gates repeating, identical, vanishing into shadow.

That’s when I noticed the footprints.

They weren’t fresh. No shine, no moisture. Just impressions pressed deep into the polished floor, barefoot, slightly too long, toes dragging. They stopped right in front of the chair I’d been sleeping in.

Facing me.

A laugh bubbled up in my throat—nervous, stupid. “Okay,” I whispered. “Someone’s messing around.”

The laugh died when the lights dimmed.

Not off. Just… lower. Like the airport was settling into a deeper sleep.

A voice crackled through the speakers.

“Final boarding call.”

It wasn’t distorted. That was the worst part. It sounded close. Familiar. Like my own voice, played back half a second too slow.

“Passenger… please proceed to the gate.”

Every screen flickered. My flight number appeared on all of them at once. GATE 0.

There was no Gate 0. I knew that. Airports don’t start at zero.

The footprints began to move.

They didn’t appear one by one. They slid, as if whatever made them was gliding just above the floor, approaching without sound. I backed away, heart hammering, until my shoulders hit glass.

Outside the windows, there were no planes. No runway lights. Just darkness, thick and endless, pressing against the glass like deep water.

The footprints stopped inches from my feet.

The speaker clicked again.

“You fell asleep too early,” it said gently. “Everyone does, once.”

The lights went out.

In the dark, something breathed.

Warm air brushed my ankle.

When the lights snapped back on, the terminal was full again—people rushing, phones ringing, announcements blaring. A security guard was shaking my shoulder.

“Ma’am? You can’t sleep here. Flight’s boarding.”

I stumbled up, dizzy, my mouth dry. The screens showed the correct time now. Normal gates. Normal noise.

As I walked away, I glanced back at the chair.

For just a moment, I saw barefoot prints on the floor.

I’ve never attempted a low / no buy before, so would appreciate some insight from others who are further along this path than me!

**My why:** in June 2026, either my rent is going to massively increase (>£300 a month), or I’m going to have to move house. I need to see if I can afford a big rent increase, and if not, I need to save for the cost of moving house (and not create extra work for myself by buying things just for them to be packed up and moved in 6 months!). 

**No buy categories:**\
- Jigsaws\
- New technology (unless something breaks beyond repair)\
- Skincare & toiletries are replace only\
- Home decor and trinkets\
- Physical books\
- Art / hobby supplies (may replace essentials if they completely run out, like masking tape)\
- Stationery

**General rules:**\
- Groceries will be delivered / click and collect only (if I go into the supermarket I tend to spend about £20 more than I’ve planned)\
- Clothes hanger spin every 3 months (saw this tip a while back and have never got around to implementing it: you turn all your coat hangers round the ‘wrong’ way, and as you wear an item, that specific coat hanger goes back into the wardrobe the right way round. At the end of your chosen time period, any hangers that are still the wrong way round should be sold or donated. I don’t have many clothes, so quarterly works for me.)\
- May buy clothes from charity shops if I’ve got a genuine need for them, ONLY using funds raised from selling on Vinted / eBay\
- If I want to buy something, it has to sit in the ‘Purchase Waiting Room’ for 14/30 days, depending on the item’s value\
- Practice the ethical gift giving pyramid (give memories, then time, then something upcycled etc)\
- My money is automatically allocated to categorised pots on Monzo when it comes in; no more ‘borrowing’ from one pot to pay for something unrelated (e.g. I’ve taken money from my groceries pot before to buy homeware that I didn’t need)

**Exceptions / Green List:**\
- The usual groceries / fuel / medical stuff / underwear etc. Essentials. 
- Will replace my phone battery at some point this year (I have an iPhone that’s over 4 years old and it’s struggling)\
- Items on my thrift dream list that I come across in the wild\
- Experiences\
- £25 a month discretionary fund for things like coffee out, taking a train somewhere etc. will review amount in Q2\
- Pin badges as souvenirs / mementos of experiences\
- Will save up to buy 3 pieces from my favourite glass artist in September (~£75)\
- 1 Haircut

**Thrift dream list:**\
- Printers type tray\
- Jigsaws by Val Goldfinch or Elena Essex\
- Jigsaws over 3,000 pieces",5,1766850409.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False

Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question.

Equipment:

\-Grinder: Breville BCG820BSS Smart Grinder Pro

\-Kettle: Stagg EKG pro (recommendation from a friend). Seems great. 

\-Pure over signature brew kit 

First time: grind size 35. It took 3-5min and never fully filtered, I had to agitate the piss out of it. Tons of fines in it afterwards. Overall tasted pretty good though, better than my drip coffee.

Second time: upped grind size to 50 to get courser. Still did not filter well and had to agitate. It’s actually stuck and not filtering after 5-10min unless I agitate it with glass stirring spoon. Still tasted good, less fines.

But I still find myself missing uni life. It was so easy to meet people — sitting next to someone in the library, chatting while queuing for coffee, those late nights grinding through assignments together. The buzz at the start of the academic year, joining societies, the things I barely noticed at the time.

I miss the general vibe: the random hangouts, being surrounded by people, the energy of a campus. Life felt full of hope then. There was a simplicity to university life that’s hard to recreate later.

Which brings me here.

I’d love to find people to play basketball with on a regular basis. I’m not trying to join the NBA, I just want to run around, sweat a little, and pretend I still have knees. I’m also hoping to meet other tech folks who are job hunting and want to cowork at coffee shops so we can keep each other sane and prevent ourselves from doom‑scrolling job boards alone.

And since it’s 2026, I’m shooting for the stars: new job, new friends, and maybe even a new husband. Why not go for the triple‑double.

As the road from Medan winds upward into the Karo Highlands, the air turns crisp, mist drifts between pine trees, and the silhouettes of Mount Sibayak and Mount Sinabung slowly emerge on the horizon. This small highland town has long been a cherished weekend escape for Medan locals—and today, it quietly captures the hearts of international travelers seeking a deeper, more authentic Sumatra.

Mornings in Berastagi begin with cool air and the distant hum of local life. At the traditional market, vendors call out cheerfully while arranging piles of freshly harvested oranges, passion fruit, and strawberries grown on the surrounding volcanic soil. The scent of earth and spices lingers as you wander through rows of colorful produce, sharing smiles with locals who are proud of their land and traditions.

Adventure is never far away. Before dawn, hikers set out toward the steaming slopes of Mount Sibayak, guided by the soft glow of headlamps and the promise of sunrise at the crater rim. As the sun rises, clouds roll beneath your feet and the volcano exhales wisps of sulfur, reminding you that this landscape is alive. After the hike, soaking in nearby hot springs feels like a reward crafted by nature itself—warm, mineral-rich waters easing tired muscles while mist curls into the morning air.

As evening falls, Berastagi slows down. Cool temperatures invite quiet walks, warm meals, and conversations over local coffee. The mountains stand watch as the sky fades into deep blues and purples, and you realize that Berastagi is more than just a stop on the map. It is a place where nature, culture, and everyday life blend seamlessly—offering travelers not just sights to see, but stories to carry home from the heart of Sumatra.

I've worked in the same place as him for years but we worked in different areas before so I didn't see him much initially. However, he transferred to my department earlier this year, so I started being with him for a few days every week. I also spent loads of time talking to him one on one as there would be lots of days where we were the only people in our area.

But now he's going back to his old department in a sudden change which was made and I'm going to go back to only seeing him for like a minute every couple of weeks if I'm lucky to even cross paths with him in the hallway. I could talk to him about loads of stuff when we were in the same room, both non-work and work related and he was the person at work I felt most comfortable around and could relate to most. But now I won't be able to have regular conversations with him and will probably only be able to have quick small talk with him if I happen to cross him in the hallway.

I'm scared that any connection we had will fade away and that we will grow distant with each other. However, I want to remain work friends with him, even if he doesn't like me back in the same way I like him. Getting to see him made what would have otherwise been boring days much better and there are not many people I've met that I've felt I can just be myself around as much.

What can I do to maintain a connection with him? I can't be really direct and ask him to go for coffee as I think this will scare him off, but I don't want us to become strangers and it to be like we never worked closely together either.",1,1766848472.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Not a chance.   
  
The best founders I know are scrappy pirates. Sailing lean ships, armed with AI tools, and ready to plunder conferences for maximum ROI. And with events back in full force (attendance is up 40% YoY while digital engagement falls off a cliff), the scarcity of face-to-face conversations has never made it more valuable.  
  
Here are a few pirate-approved hacks for SaaS and AI startups heading into conference season:  
  
Pick the right waters  
Go where your customers are. If you sell to dentists, don’t waste money at a fintech show.  
  
Plan early   
Hotels, flights, and sponsorships sell out. Build your event calendar now, not the week before.  
  
Scrape & segment  
Use AI to pull speaker/attendee lists, segment by ICP, and automate outreach pre-event.  
  
Assign ownership  
Every team member attending is in sales. Give each a short prospect list to work.  
  
Buy off-menu sponsorships  
A one-pager “seat drop” before the keynote can outperform a six-figure booth.  
  
Host after-hours  
Curated, relaxed peer mixers beat noisy parties. Be the connector, not the hustler.  
  
Micro-activations  
Coffee sleeves, hotel keycards, or QR pizza drops, subtle touches that stick.  
  
Measure ruthlessly

Been sifting through some of the recent online sales happenings, specifically looking at what's appearing from major retailers. It seems like there's a consistent pattern in the types of products that see significant price adjustments during these periods.

A few examples that stood out:

*   **Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation):** These have been a popular item, and it's interesting to see them offered at a reduced price, which isn't always the case for newer Apple tech.
*   **Yeti Rambler Tumblers:** These insulated drinkware items are often mentioned for their durability, and they've been part of some of the notable markdowns.
*   **Nespresso Vertuo Next Coffee Machine:** The convenience of pod-based coffee makers is evident, and this particular model has appeared in several sale roundups.
*   **Various Tech Gadgets:** Beyond the specific brands, there's a broad category of smaller electronics and accessories that consistently show up with price drops.

These kinds of curated sale events seem to highlight products that have steady consumer interest, often focusing on established brands and popular categories. It's a good reminder to see where things are trending in the retail space.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

What tricks have you found that make AI actually think instead of just answering?

I am starting my LPR journey and was wondering on just...lifestyle things. I have been reading through dr Avivs book and going to start the healing process after I recover from wisdom teeth surgery in about 2 weeks, but HAVE fully cut out caffeine(in the form of chocolate, coffee, and tea). I have only been off it a week(probably the longest I have been in 18 years since I was 15) and got the fun caffeine withdrawal headaches. 

It did immensely help, I'm feeling quite a bit less phlegm during my day and coughing, so going to stick with that for a while. My husband and I really enjoy going to try new coffee shops though on weekends, that's our form of dating. We take a book or a notebook and work on things or chat about stuff over coffee. Since I can't do coffee anymore, I worry about cutting back on that quality time. 

For those who have cut coffee but coffee shops are such a key part of your routine, what do you order when you go? Any decaf teas? Smoothies? Just bring along a bottle of alkaline water? I'm fine with doing that (she says disgruntled hahah), but my husband won't order drinks if I don't, he feels like he shouldn't get a treat if I don't get to, so then I feel bad.

1pwzv83,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pwzv83/situation/,Situation,"Ok I apologise for the long story but it’s needed for a catch up to everything.

There’s this girl…let’s call her Claire

Claire and I met months ago briefly as she worked with my mother he clicked pretty easily but that was about it. Then a couple months later I started working in the same place, met her again and we hit it off again. Constant jokes, got each other energy drinks repeatedly, tried chatting as much as we could be we were in different departments and she would offer me coffee every morning. Everyone at work thought something was going on between us.

I was gonna go watch a movie with friends one day but they were all busy so she offered to go with me. I took her up on the offer a week or so later and she wasn’t sure what I was meaning by it but she came anyway (I found out she didn’t know what I meant cause she spoke to one of her work friends and it made its way back to me)

Then a couple weeks later we went on a work day excursion to an observatory together with a couple coworkers, we spent the entire time flirting and then we had a brief discussion about kids names (don’t remember how it came up) after that we went to a pub for a beer. She drank from my second glass of beer and finished it. She sat super duper close to me too…like SUPER close. After that I asked if she wanted to hang out a little more and she said she needed to walk her dog. So we did. On the way to grab her dog from her mates house we bought up what work people were thinking and we both agreed we weren’t ready for a relationship (she’s healing from a pretty messed up situation) so we walked her dog on the beach at night, talked about some of our history (relationship and family wise) and then we grabbed dinner and parked up at another beach and chatted for a while.

Couple things happened and we were never able to find a good time to hangout together. I left the job and we kept in contact. However sometimes we’d chat constantly nonstop throughout a few days and sometimes we wouldn’t speak for days.

Last week I was out with my mates, we went to my old job for a drink and I had popped to the bathroom instantly. Apparently as I did she had come out the elevator and was told by my mum who was working at the time that I’d just got to the toilet. So her and her friends all ran down and banged on the door squealing. I came outside and we hugged. One of her friends say “oh your boyfriends finally here” she and her friends were clearly intoxicated. They tried to convince me to grab a beer so I did and sat down with my mates. She came up and started giving me a massage and said “I give amazing massages” after a few seconds all her friends sat in the chairs around us but she sat on the floor next to me.

Then we got up and I started talking to a friend who works in reception and Claire came up and legitimately planted herself super close next to me as if she was pretty much inside my skin. We chatted and she was super drunk so I recommended we find someone to take her home cause she wanted to drive herself. She said “you can take me home” I refused as I technically can’t drive at the moment (long story) but she kept going and even checked waze to make sure there were no cops around. I still refused as I didn’t want to make it weird and considering the tension in the moment I kinda knew where it would go, but her being drunk wasn’t right so I said no.

We ended up all going upstairs to the party and she made me dress up and dance with her, made me spin her around and then we instinctively locked hands and danced for a few seconds before we both pulled away. She went home after a bit (drove herself which I wasn’t too happy about considering how drunk she was) She lives about a minute away from work.

A few days ago she came to my house for a Christmas Eve dinner (she got here early) and again we were super flirty when she helped me set up lights outside. My mother and her friend were watching us from inside and they both were making fun of us for how hard we were flirting. My mums friend yelled from inside “just get together you two” which I didn’t hear but she looked up and I’m assuming she heard. She kept looking at me all night and even when I went inside to make a cocktail she turned to face me and just stared.

After she went home (I know this parts stupid but bear with me) she recorded a TikTok lip syncing and dancing and falling on her bed to the song “Greedy” from Ariana Grande. She then posted it the day after…As I said, stupid, I know.

All this to say. At first when we agreed we weren’t ready. I was not ready and I very much just wanted to be friends. Now I seem to have unexpectedly developed feelings for her but I don’t know if she feels the same.

She came to my work yesterday and all my coworkers picked up on the fact we were super flirty too, and they all gave me shit for it today all day long.

She’s iffy with response times and she’ll be online multiple times but won’t respond to my texts for a bit. Now she’s moving city in two months and I don’t know what to do. She’s coming to my house for dinner with my mum and some friends tomorrow night.

I feel it’s only right for me to let her know cause I feel bad stringing on the fact that maybe she thinks I just want a friendship but I don’t want to lie to her about that as I feel it’s wrong. I also don’t want to lose a friend but I want to put myself first emotionally even if it does inadvertently mean I lose a friendship if she doesn’t feel the same.

She had a guy friend in the same situation not too long ago but he got super drunk and yelled at her and insulted her cause she was at his house and she made brownies and was flirting with one of his mates. She was only friends with him but has now completely removed him from her life as he said horrid things to her and he thought they were dating.

But yeah, apologies for the long post. What ever clarity you guys can give me or whatever opinion or idea you have, please share.

TL;DR:

I met a girl (“Claire”) through work and we’ve had strong, consistent flirtation for months—coworkers noticed, we hung out one-on-one, shared intimate moments, danced, touched, and clearly have chemistry. We both initially agreed we weren’t ready for a relationship, but over time I’ve developed real feelings and now I’m unsure if she feels the same.

I didn’t recognize her at all, so I didn’t think much of it.

When I walked out toward the parking lot, she suddenly ran after me and called my name. I answered, and she immediately broke down crying, apologizing over and over again.

It took me a second to realize who she was. She was one of the people who bullied me in middle school. She pushed me against walls, grabbed my backpack, and made that period of my life genuinely painful.

Standing there, I felt split in two. On one hand, we are both in our thirties now. I have spent years trying to move forward. I didn’t want to reopen old wounds in a public parking lot, and I didn’t want to turn the moment into something heavy. On the other hand, this was the first time someone had ever truly acknowledged the harm they caused me back then.

In the end, I chose to comfort her. I told her I had let it go. She refunded my coffee and gave me a twenty-five dollar gift card, and then we went our separate ways.

But afterward, I kept thinking about it. In that moment, was there really a “right” choice?

Accepting her apology didn’t magically erase what happened, and comforting her didn’t mean it never hurt me. It just meant that, at that moment, I chose the option that felt least violent to myself.

Maybe growing up is realizing that healing doesn’t always look clean or empowering. Sometimes it’s quiet, awkward, and unresolved. And sometimes, all you can do is walk away carrying a little more clarity, and a little less weight than before.",2,1766847790.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

The damage happened in 2 areas.  One was the bottom area near the dishwasher and the second area is at a cabinet end. See photos.

The stove is under the glass block. Many have asked.

If it were possible to repair and match these areas that is the move.   But I am not sure that is possible 

Island - I like the idea of changing the lighting above the island and removing the sofit to put pendants there.    I am also intrigued by the one level island.    The kitchen is the main room in the house.   People always gather around the island having the upper lower makes a great divide while we are cooking and where we can place food and snacks for guests. 

Flooring - many of you hate the flooring.  I would change it but still would go with LVP as it is the most reasonable cost and durable but I do agree that lighter is better. This flooring goes all over my downstairs.  Also have dog and lots of foot traffic.   Tile / mud job not an option.

More so for coffee chains (like *that one*), as more and more seem to be converting to cup lids made to sip from directly, as opposed to requiring a straw to be punched through the top. I've seen them being used around other places as well.

Whenever they just hand me the cup and straw in one hand, I'm always too awkward to speak up and say ""no straw"" at that point. I'm expected to just take it and leave, it feels like I'd be inconveniencing them somehow since they would have to bring everything back inside so they can grab out the straw. That may be a me issue, I just don't like causing any inconveniences to strangers unless there's a valid reason to and I have no choice.

I end up with a collection of unused straws piling up in my car. They end up all over the place, in the bins, the back seats, the floor, etc, etc. Eventually they all go in the trash, as I have no use for them, I don't use straws at home, and if a cup does need a straw it's always going to be included anyways.

Not been able to pass anything proper for almost a week (6/7 days i think) 

I’m also worried doctors are misdiagnosing me, ive been doctors/hospital twice , christmas day and also Friday and given ibuprofen pills or a syringe with ibuprofen to swallow, Dosent help the pain. Havent been able to get laxido or my suppositories as pharmacies have been shut over Christmas .

1. I’m SO weak, it takes so much energy to even turn sides in my bed, extremely painful to get up, i haven’t even been using my phone or doing anything due to the pain, i cannot concentrate. Ive been so pale , i literally looked SICK earlier this week

Usually i have atleast 1 poo per day, maybe even 2. But i currently cannot pass anything except liquid, Just small blots of diarrhea looking stuff, I feel something hard trying to come out but when i try to push my ears start ringing, i get sweaty or fever like, hands get clammy so i just wipe up and stop trying. 

3. I cannot remember the last time ive eaten, earlier this week i was drinking plenty of warm waters, eating ripe bananas , berries, fruits but now i can hardly even eat 2 blueberries, if i eat anything its just going to get more blocked up. 
My hands are clammy writing this and im only lying in bed. 

The pain is constant stabbing inside of my bum, scratching like glass. I havent vomited or had bleeding so far but its just so painful , tried ibuprofen even cannabis nothing helps the pain.

Yesterday my stomach felt ‘full’ it was so bloated i literally thought it would just burst or something. I’m so scared

My circulation isnt great but i cant even excersize because of the pain , I can still pass small bits of gas every few hours - Had cramp in left thigh because lying on left side wws the only thing that felt slightly less painful, woke up today with left shoulder pain (probably from lying on it) 

i’ve tried coffee, tea , sugar waters and also eating coconut oil, still nothing solid coming out, i just feel lost i don’t know what to do anymore.

1pwzdgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pwzdgx/new_boyfriend_is_a_bit_cheap/,New boyfriend is a bit cheap,"24 f 25 m I’ve started dating a very sweet man who spoils me with assurance and affection. I never have to guess if he’s doing somthing weird and it’s been great. He’s very thoughtful and treats me with acts of service. Like driving, bringing me food after working all day, morning texts, words of affection. I just have noticed a few incompatibilities. First is that he’s a bit cheap. The pro to that is that I’ve learned some saving tips from him but I think he could be less stingy with money. He’d rather spend 3x the time investment to get somthing cheaper and whenever we go out to eat he almost always searches for fast food deals and doesn’t like paying full price. We have been dating for 4 months and never went to a sit down restaurant which is kind of surprising. For Christmas his gift for me was nice it was a hunch of thoughtful things i needed like phone cords a cheaper dupe to a perfume I was running low on, etc. I was having such a hard time finding him somthing because he thinks he can find everything cheaper second hand and doesn’t want me to pay full price. I ended up getting him smart wool socks because he only had cheap cotton socks and he wants to return them because the price is rediculous to him. Which is fine but I don’t understand why he can’t just accept my gift the socks are super nice. I also recently bought 2 pairs of leggings and a sports bra for $100 and he couldn’t stop talking about how much I spent. Even though it’s really not a bad price it’s a quite mid price tbh. He’s in school right now for nursing nd only works on the weekends so I understand him wanting to save but his reactions to reasonably priced items is concerning. I barely buy things but when I do I don’t cheap out on things and I use them for years because the quality isn’t bad. I also believe time is money and when you sell all your time away to find somthing a bit cheaper you’re selling yourself short and using a ton of time you could use to make more money. Last night we got a pack of skittles for a little under 3 dollars and he cringed when he saw the price. I just can’t help but notice this mindset he has. It’s not bothering me too much but when I think bout the grand scheme of things this could be a big problem in the relationship. He’s just very stuck to his spending habits whereas I feel I’ve learned from him but he’s still super cheap. Like I have hoodies that I bought for a little over $100 dollars over 5 years ago. And they still look perfect while he’s replaced many cheap ones in those years. I just feel like a reasonable spender and he thinks I make stupid spending choices.  But everything I own has stayed with me for years and has kept me warm and looking way nicer than the clothes he gets that don’t look as nice and have to be replaced so he prob ends up spending the same anyway. I also have been am having trouble with him because he thinks I should buy a cheap coffee grinder for espresso but you can cheap out on the grinder it’s like the motor to the whole thing. Anyway what do you think. It concerns me nbecause I think we have diffferent visions on this 

Another issue is that I’ve only travelled out of the country once and I want to start traveling again because I have the chance since I’m not working 60-70 hours a week anymore like I have for the past 5 years. My bf had traveled to more countries than I have in my life and doesn’t want to travel for over a year because of school but also doesn’t want me to solo travel and it’s making me sad because I’ve worked so hard and I just want to explore since I never did growing up. Last year I worked my ass off for billionaires and he traveled back to back for months. Which is great for him. When I tried telling him I want to travel bad because I’ve only left the country once he laughed and said many people don’t even leave their country and “Americans are so funny”. Which made me a bit annoyed. It’s like if I said some people haven’t eaten for days after he says he’s hungry. 

He also has his me from his parents because he doesn’t think they’ll accept me since I don’t have a degree. His family is Indian so he doesn’t want them to judge me. They seem to be very strict with him and not let him stay away for a night ",0,1766846463.0,dating_advice,15,0.44,False

1pwzao3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pwzao3/peaches/,Peaches,"I learned early on in life that order was something you practiced, rather than something you achieved. It needed to be tended to, sometimes gently, but other times at a cost. Doors locked twice — once to know, once to confirm knowing. Mugs were placed where the light reached them all evenly on the counter. Shoes aligned so that their absence would register immediately. If I corrected one thing, then I corrected everything. Stopping halfway through was worse than starting over completely. 

Slyvia had never tried to cure me of this. She adapted to it. She learned which rules had mattered and which ones I could be talked down from performing. She knew when to speak and when to let the counting finish out. On mornings when my hands shook too badly to pour the coffee, she would set the mug down for me without comment and turn the handle, so it faced the window. I did not ask her to do this, she noticed. 

We grew old together in small methodical movements. She folded laundry while I aligned the dishes in the kitchen. I trimmed the hedges while she tended to the soil. Not often, but sometimes she would deliberately misplace something —a book left sideways, or a drawer not closed all the way—just to watch me correct it. She’d smile, kiss my cheek, and say nothing. That was enough. 

The estate eased with time. Paint thinned, and paths set themselves. Sylvia kept the plants alive and thriving throughout this slow decay. She’d say that the peaches were forgiving, that they wanted to grow even when they were neglected. She planted the grove herself during our early years there, spacing out the saplings carefully and humming while she worked. I measured the distances afterward, anxious to not interfere. The spaces were even. I remember feeling relief overtake sharply; I hadn’t realized how tense that I was. 

When Sylvia’s health began to deteriorate, it did not arrive as pain. It came as interruption. A pause in my life where there had been movement. There was a moment where she leaned against the counter instead of standing beside me. She laughed it off, and I accepted that justification because it allowed the routines to continue.  

I began waking up before her, listening to her breath. The rhythm changed in increments to slow to mark. I counted the seconds between breaths until the numbers became blurred. She smiled at me when her eyes opened, reaching for my hand gently as if I were the one needing reassurance. 

There is a distinct stillness that a house takes on when someone does not wake. I noticed it before I noticed her. The coffee went cold, and sunlight shifted across the floor without interruption. I called out her name once. Not hearing a response, I did not say it again. 

Thereafter, the house no longer corrected itself. Objects remained where they had been left. Her mug remained on the table. I did not move it. At dusk, I walked the grounds because that was something we had grown to do together. Walking alone I saw that the grove was intact. That mattered more than it should have. 

The nights became congested with noises. Walls expanded and contracted. The floorboards adjusting under my weight. I could not name the sounds, only their timing. At dusk — always at dusk — the orchard drew my attention the way an irregularity does when it reveals itself. I went to it in order to confirm that nothing had been misaligned. 

The trees were bare and skeletal then. Their branches clawed upward with unnecessary effort. I felt Sylvia there — not as a memory, but as alignment. The grove hummed in the cadence she kept while working there. 

That night I dreamt of her. 

The dream did not begin in the way that dreams usually do. There was no transition or sense of arrival. I stood at the mouth of the orchard. My boots pressed into the soil; it felt like it had been freshly worked. The trees were arranged with a precision that released a tension in my chest. I did not count my steps as I walked among them; I did not need to. 

Sylvia stood near the center of the grove, the ground dipping beneath her. She was dressed in white, the fabric thin and clinging to her in places as though it had absorbed the night air itself. Her hands were coated with dark soil that packed beneath her nails. She did not look at me at first; she was watching the trees. 

When I approached her, she turned to me, smiling the same smile she’d offer when I finished correcting something. There was an approval in it.  

In her dirt coated hands, she cradled a peach. It was larger than any I remembered from the grove, and sickly pale under the moonlight. Its skin looked stretched thin, and taut as if it had grown too quickly and been forced to stop. She raised the peach to her lips and bit down.  

The sound was wrong. Not the clean split of fruit, but a soft, wet yielding of pressure. Thick dark liquid spilled over her stained fingers. It ran along her wrist, soaking into the sleeve of her dress. She offered no reaction, rather she kept chewing, slowly, purposefully, watching me. 

“Partake,” she said, “and you will be as I am.” 

She pressed the peach to my mouth before I could speak, and I bit down. 

Overwhelming sweetness came first, then iron. Ancient and clotted, the fruit slid down my throat with purpose. Its pit scraped against my teeth as I swallowed. 

I awoke late, my jaw aching and mouth coated thick with residue. My lips stuck together with their nightly film when I tried to part them. The taste remained with me. Iron. 

The coughing began without warning. 

It was not the sharp direct cough of illness. It was deep and tearing, as though my body was attempting to reject something that didn’t belong inside it. Reaching the bathroom barely in time, I gripped the edge of the sink as convulsions writhed through me. 

What came up was not liquid or phlegm. It was pulp. 

Fibrous and thick, it clung to the porcelain instinctively, as though it had been waiting for a surface to adhere to. Strings of it stretched between my mouth and the basin when I retched again. My throat throbbed, scraped raw. After it was over, I remained there, watching it settle. 

I felt no panic. I remained still. I let it happen. 

I rinsed out my mouth and the taste lingered. 

When twilight fell, the orchard eased something that the house could not. Strolling there, the last of the heaviness in my chest subsided. I told myself that the dream had been just that. Dreams do not bleed into waking life. 

The orchard did not dispute me. 

When the first pit came, it proclaimed itself as pressure; a rigid and firm entity lodged low in my throat. I counted my steps to the kitchen, each number falling hard as though steadying me for what came to follow. 

It surfaced wholly. 

I held it in my palm, slick with vibrant mucilage and larger than any other pit I had seen Sylvia remove from our peaches in the summer. Its surface was jagged, uneven, and darkened in blotches that held no pattern. It was warm in my hand. 

I rinsed it off carefully. The water ran amber, then clear. 

I stood before the garbage disposal longer than necessary. Disposing of the pit hadn’t occurred to me as an option until I saw the switch, the pit clenched in my fist, my arm locked in place. My body rejected the motion. The friction was immediate and absolute, like trying to force two magnets together the wrong way. 

I placed the pit beside the devil’s ivy on the windowsill instead. 

Not immediately, not predictably, but afterwards the process began to repeat. Some days the soreness in my throat would linger without relief. On those days I found myself restless, scattered, and stopping halfway through corrections without knowing why. When the pulp came, it varied — sometimes brutal and violent; other times it would be slow and difficult. Each pit that my throat birthed left me weaker, and my vision darker around the edges. Still, the relief afterwards was intoxicatingly strong.  

I began carrying the pits with me at nightfall. 

At first, I’d wrap them in cloth. Later I kept them loose in my pockets; their weight became familiar enough to me that if one went missing, it would become immediately apparent. I no longer counted the steps to the grove. The numbers subsided without announcement, and my feet found the path on their own. 

Planting the pits took time. Some places in the earth rejected them while others opened easily. I adjusted their spacings thoughtfully, when I had it wrong the ground would correct their placements. 

As the grove shifted and changed, I did too. 

The estate lost its certainty, becoming more of a suggestion rather than a structure. Corners softened as rooms blurred into one another. In the orchard my sight became cruelly sharp to its growth. Stretched skin peaches that grew too heavy for their branches enveloped the tree line. Roots surfaced in ways that reshaped the earth and created paths to guide me. 

The dreams returned simpler than before. 

Sylvia stood at the center of the orchard like always. Sometimes she watched me, other times she’d knell beside me to correct the spacing of my planting efforts with her fingers. She did not offer me fruit again. There was no need too. 

When I would wake in the morning, I would check the grounds. 

She would always be right. 

The final pit came on a night blanketed under snow. It was larger than the others and heavier in my hands. I wrapped myself in layers and walked the orchard without hesitance. 

Reaching the groves center I lowered myself to the wet ground, my strength depleted. I pressed the pit into the earth, and it accepted it’s offering graciously. 

When the roots began to press against my body, neither urgency nor restraint came to me.  

Sylvia knelt by my side as the earth accepted me. 

She looked the way she always had in the orchard; her hands knew where to go as she positioned me evenly with care. 

The orchard did not bury us. 

The orchard received us. 

And the orchard breathes evenly now. 

Epilogue:  

The estate was sold quietly. Passing from one owner to the next, walls were repainted; rooms were refurnished and reassigned to new purposes. 

The orchard remained untouched. 

In summer, the peaches hung low and heavy, their skins pale and inviting. Many of the visitors would remark of their sweetness, and some would even note of their faint metallic qualities. 

All of those who visited the orchard dreamed. 

Some returned and would bring others with them. Most carried the pits away at first, unsure of what to do with them. Their hands would hesitate, and their movements would be half-stalled. The act of discarding them felt unholy. 

Most chose to plant them at the orchard’s edge. 

The grove expanded slowly, deliberately. Where the ground was broken, new trees would rise. Roots thickened beneath soil, adjusting themselves, correcting their spacing. 

Children played beneath branches, and couples would walk the rows at dusk. At night, some could feel the earth expressing a soft rhythm beneath them — not counted or hummed — only felt. 

When the leaves fell, they fell in pairs. ",1,1766846249.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

After that he just shuts down completely and acts as if I don’t exist only saying a couple words and that’s it, I again tried to apologize to him ( I was really emotional and crying my eyes out) but he was still acting mean and indifferent to me, saying he is tired of arguing so much and  that I’m always trying to create an argument about anything with him. This has been a cycle by now and the thing that really sets me off is that when he is in the middle of shutting down and ignoring me he again goes back to play with his brother or by himself and laughs and all of that while I’m in the other room crying my soul out and I don’t understand how can he block his emotions that fast an easily and all of this started because  I asked him to spend some quality time with me and to laugh and enjoy while he is with me like he does when he is playing but he thinks my problem is he playing. I’m starting to feel like I’m a toxic girlfriend and a very problematic too , all I’m 100% sure is that I love that man with all my heart and I really want things to work out between us. Side note: he did say sorry for throwing clothes at me and that he will never do that again but that was it.

I haven't heard a thing from her until she send me a card last month saying ""good luck with your pregnancy"" after she found out  (I haven't told her personally but other family members have). On Christmas eve, she told my Nan that she wanted to speak to me again and ""move on and forget the past"". Christmas day, she sent a text to me just saying Happy Christmas from Mum and Dad. 

Yesterday, I constructed what I hoped was a reasonable reply. There are real reasons why I'm still upset from several incidents that happened a few years ago-along with the decade of low interest in me from her before then. 

*To give a quick context, 2.5 years ago, I drove 100+mi to where my parents live and asked if they wanted to meet for a coffee. I'd also asked my Nan, who happily accepted a meal out. When my Mum found out about this, she lied to me, saying my Nan wanted to meet all together at a place my Mum chose. I gently but firmly told her I knew that wasn't true and again asked her if she'd like to meet separately. She rejected my offer and instead wrote me a letter, repeating the lie and saying it would be too difficult to have a conversation.  

A few months later, I visited my Nan and saw the dire conditions she was living in (despite my parents saying they were looking after her). I'll admit I was angry with them. I was trying to sort out help for my Nan when my Mum got involved and turned the whole family against me, leaving me completely frozen out for months. She also got a mediation my Uncle had planned for us all cancelled. We haven't spoken since a heated call where she hung up on me.

So I'm still very sensitive about all of this, and have told her that in order for any kind of relationship going forward, I need to be able to talk about the things that happened. I can't just forget. I said i know it won't be an easy conversation,  but it's important to me. I just feel like her response has invalidated the one thing I needed to hear,  and I can feel the defensiveness already. Am I imagining this? I'm kind of regretting agreeing to talk now because I just have a feeling it's not going to go well, and I don't need the additional stress (along with having a less than smooth pregnancy).



My reply to her saying Happy Christmas:

Hi 
I appreciate you getting in touch. I'm going to be honest with you, I have a lot of complicated feelings, especially about the last few years. (probably increased at the moment because of hormones as well).

I'm willing to talk, but feel like we'd need to have a proper, verbal conversation before I can be comfortable in starting a new foundation.

I can't forget without talking things through because that would feel like invalidating things that happened that deeply affected me. But having that difficult conversation should allow us both to move forward with less chance of resentment. I understand it's not going to be easy talking about everything, but I would appreciate if you could do this. 

Please let me know how you feel about this.. 
I'm pretty busy over the weekend with work, but maybe next week we could organise something.



Her reply:

Yes I am willing to talk and listen to what you have to say but you must appreciate that it won’t be easy for me either and sometimes you have to accept  that we see things in a different way and put the past behind us and move on. I am available mon 29th anytime not sure of other times yet but if you can let me know what is convenient for you I am sure we can work something out.

I've thought a long time about how to structure this post. I decided to share everything I've learned about habit formation in one comprehensive guide.

Structure of this post:

Introduction.

About my struggle (or rather, my journey).

Brief summary of my framework (The Habit Rewiring System).

A bit of Neuroscience.

Conclusion.

1. Introduction

Warning: Very long text.

Important Note: I work full time and have family responsibilities. I won't be able to respond to every comment immediately, but I will try to answer questions when I can.

This is my first time sharing this framework publicly. The format is intentional—structured, methodical, and comprehensive. I wanted to document the exact system that worked for me after years of trial and error.

Disclaimer: This post contains no quick fixes or miracle cures. Everything here has been tested through personal experience and is backed by behavioral science research.

2. About My Struggle

This section covers several aspects of my journey:

The cycle of habit failure.

The trap of motivation dependence.

The breakthrough moment.

The implementation phase.

For fifteen years, I lived in a perpetual cycle of failed habit attempts. I would get motivated, create elaborate systems, stick with them for 3-7 days, then crash. The pattern was so predictable it became almost comical setting ambitious goals on Sunday night, feeling unstoppable by Tuesday, slipping slightly on Wednesday, and by Friday, abandoning everything completely.

I tried everything: habit trackers, accountability partners, rewards, punishments, public commitments. Nothing worked long-term. Each failure reinforced my self-perception as someone fundamentally incapable of consistency.

The trap of motivation dependence was particularly insidious. I would wait for inspiration, ride the wave of enthusiasm, then crash when the feeling inevitably faded. I was like an addict chasing a high, except my drug was the fleeting feeling of ""this time will be different.""

By coincidence or fate, my professional work eventually led me to study behavioral science. I began approaching my habit problems not as moral failings but as system failures. This was my breakthrough moment.

I realized that willpower is finite, motivation is unreliable, and most habit advice focuses on the wrong variables entirely. I didn't need more discipline I needed better understanding of how behavior actually works.

The implementation phase took three years of meticulous experimentation, documentation, and refinement. I treated myself as both scientist and subject. Every failure wasn't a moral lapse but a data point. Every success wasn't luck but a reproducible process.

3. Brief Summary of My Framework

In my previous attempts, I approached habits vaguely, and my strategies were based on popular advice rather than behavioral mechanics. My framework takes a different approach:

THE FOUR LEVERS OF BEHAVIOR (The Foundation)

Principle: Every habitual behavior persists or fails based on four fundamental levers that can be systematically adjusted.

LEVER 1: FRICTION

* High friction behaviors require conscious effort and willpower
* Low friction behaviors happen almost automatically
* Strategy: Ruthlessly eliminate friction from desired behaviors and add friction to undesired ones

LEVER 2: TRIGGERS

* All habitual behaviors are responses to specific environmental cues
* These triggers operate largely beyond conscious awareness
* Strategy: Map your existing triggers, then systematically reprogram them

LEVER 3: EMOTIONAL PAYOFF

* Behaviors persist when they deliver immediate emotional relief
* Even ""bad"" habits solve an emotional problem effectively
* Strategy: Identify the emotional payoff of current habits, then create alternative pathways to the same feeling

LEVER 4: IDENTITY ALIGNMENT

* Behaviors that conflict with self-image require constant willpower
* Behaviors that reinforce self-image become increasingly automatic
* Strategy: Engineer specific identity shifts through small, consistent wins

From these levers come several crucial principles:

Environment Defeats Willpower: No amount of motivation can overcome a physical environment designed against you. Design your spaces for automatic success.

Habit Bundling: Link new habits to existing automatic behaviors to bypass the need for conscious decision-making.

Minimum Viable Action: Reduce new habits to such tiny actions that success becomes inevitable (e.g., ""put on running shoes"" rather than ""run 5k"").

Emotional Substitution: Rather than fighting against bad habits, create alternative pathways to the same emotional states they provide.

Implementation Intent: Replace vague goals (""exercise more"") with specific trigger-response plans (""When I finish my morning coffee, I will immediately do 10 pushups"").

(Note: I initially planned to include detailed examples for each principle, but realized it would make this post excessively long. I may share specific implementation examples in a follow-up.)

4. A Bit of Neuroscience

I want to explain why traditional approaches so often fail, and why this framework succeeds where others don't.

The brain operates on two systems that I call the ""Future Self"" and the ""Present Self.""

The Future Self (Prefrontal Cortex)  
This is the part of our brain responsible for planning, decision-making, and delayed gratification. It makes grand plans on Sunday night for the week ahead. It genuinely wants to exercise, eat well, and be productive.

The Present Self (Limbic System)  
This is the much older, more powerful system concerned with immediate comfort, pleasure, and pain avoidance. It controls behavior in the moment when choices actually happen.

Traditional habit advice addresses the Future Self making plans, setting goals, creating schedules. But habit execution happens entirely in the domain of the Present Self.

When we feel like we're ""fighting ourselves"" to maintain habits, we're experiencing the fundamental disconnect between these systems. The key insight is this: The Future Self cannot directly control the Present Self. It can only influence it by manipulating the four levers.

This explains why willpower alone fails. Willpower is the Future Self trying to override the Present Self through brute force a strategy with predictably poor results.

Instead, the Future Self must act more like an architect, designing environments and systems that make desired behaviors easier and undesired behaviors harder for the Present Self.

The Neurological Habit Loop

At the neural level, habits form through a three-part loop:

1. Trigger: The cue that initiates the behavior
2. Behavior: The actual habit
3. Reward: The payoff that reinforces the behavior

Most people focus exclusively on the middle component (the behavior itself) while neglecting the trigger and reward. This is precisely why they fail.

The strength of a habit is determined not by how much you want it consciously, but by how effectively the trigger-behavior-reward loop is wired into your neural pathways.

5. Conclusion

The most profound shift in my approach to habits came when I stopped seeing them as tests of character and started seeing them as engineering problems.

Bad habits aren't moral failings they're effectively designed systems that reliably deliver emotional rewards with minimal friction. Good habits often fail not because we're weak, but because we've designed them poorly.

When I finally understood this, everything changed. I stopped trying to be ""more disciplined"" and started redesigning my environment, reprogramming my triggers, creating alternative emotional payoffs, and engineering small identity shifts.

The results have been transformative. Over the past three years, I've successfully:

* Established a consistent daily exercise routine after 15 years of failure
* Completely eliminated social media scrolling as a time-wasting habit
* Built a daily reading practice that's now as automatic as brushing my teeth
* Transformed my eating patterns without relying on ""willpower""
* Developed a consistent creative practice that has produced tangible results

None of this happened through motivation or discipline. It happened through systematic application of behavioral science principles.

I have so much more I could share about implementation specifics. This post is already quite long, and I'll decide whether to continue based on the response.

If you're interested in more detailed breakdowns of specific habit transformations or implementation guides for particular areas (productivity, health, digital habits, etc.), please let me know in the comments.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. If even one person finds a pathway out of the habit failure cycle through these ideas, sharing them will have been worthwhile.

P.S. I recognize that this framework won't resonate with everyone. We all have different neurological wiring, life circumstances, and challenges.

Last few kilometres were narrow village roads with brutal potholes. Drove slowly, picked lines carefully — and somehow, the car made it without drama. 

Still: doable, but not advisable unless you really trust your ground clearance and tyres.

The drive was worth it. Rice fields, kids waving, proper grand-touring scenery that reminds you Jaguars aren’t just for cafés.

The place itself is calm, arty, and quietly impressive. Run by a Cambodian chef and an Australian musician from The Cambodian Space Project, with good coffee, excellent Khmer food (smoked eggplant with minced pork over rice was spot on), and a genuine community vibe.

Would I do it again in an F-Type? Probably not.
Did it make the trip more memorable? Absolutely. 🐆",46,1766845604.0,Jaguar,9,0.95,False

1pwz1cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pwz1cd/am_i_the_asshole_family_christmas_edition/,Am I the Asshole: Family Christmas Edition,"DISCLAIMER: I am always very grateful for what I receive from anyone for Christmas because it means that they thought of me! 

Am I the asshole? This year, for my family's Christmas gift exchange, we decided to just do Secret Santa ($150 budget) so we could save money this year. I had absolutely no problems with this idea, and I decided that I would participate, mind you it was optional to participate, and even if one of us didn't want to do it, we still would've gotten them gifts. 

Anyways, the people who participated were me, my two sisters, their significant others, my mom, and my mom's kinda sorta boyfriend.  For context, my mom and this man have been 'together' since I was 8 years old, and I am now 21. 

When we decided to do Secret Santa, my sister downloaded one of those apps, I believe we used elfster, to make it easy on everyone. If you've never used one of these apps, basically, it will randomly give people a Secret Santa, and there is a wishlist area that is linked to Amazon, so that you can create a wishlist with links to everything.

A couple of weeks before the exchange, my mom told me that Will, her bf, got me for Secret Santa. It is a known thing in my family that he is a terrible gift-giver; he has always gotten us random things that we don't need and would never use. I was nervous about him getting me, and I voiced that to my mom and my sisters, but I made a detailed wishlist so it was easy for him to shop for me. 

The most expensive item on that list was a new pair of work shoes that cost 66 dollars. The rest of my list consisted of alcohol markers and some coloring books, random bag charms, flavored syrups to make redbull mocktails, some glass cups with glass straws, a camo jacket I found on amazon and I wanted a gift card to Biggby Coffee. Not a crazy list at all. Come the day of our gift exchange, my mom starts passing out the gifts to everyone, and we are a family that goes around and opens one gift at a time. All the gifts are passed out, and I have four wrapped items, two of which are from my mother. Everyone else is sitting around this big pile of gifts, at least 6-10 items each. We start going around and unwrapping gifts. First, I opened my mom's gifts, and then I opened the gifts from Will. From Will, I received the 32 dollar amazon jacket, a 9 dollar bag charm, and a 25 dollar gift card to biggby was in my stocking. It came back to be my turn to open another gift, and I was kinda on the verge of tears saying ""I'm out"". Everyone else picked up on my confusion, and they ended up just opening the rest of their gifts at once.

I was keeping to myself because I didn't want anyone to see that I was upset, so I just sat on the couch and watched the movie we had put on while everyone was trying on their new clothes, etc. I then went and looked at my list on Elfster and totaled up what the items I received cost. It was 66 dollars. Not even half of the allotted budget was spent. Meanwhile, he got my 2-year-old niece a bike and got a necklace for my mom as well. I texted one of my sisters because she kept bothering me, asking why I was being a grump, and I told her how much he had spent on me. Easy to say that I was furious. 

I went out to the kitchen, and my mom came up to me and gave me 100 dollars in cash and said, "" I got you."" I told her thank you for giving me money, but that wasn't the point of doing Secret Santa, and that it wasn't her job to make up for Wills shortcoming. 

I had to work later that day, so I just left and went to work. I was talking to one of my friends about the situation, and I told her I really wanted to send a text to him just to voice my disappointment. I wasn't intending to make him feel bad, so I did not bring up not being able to afford it. I just brought up the allotted budget we had. 

I said to him:

"" Hey Will, I wanted to say thank you for the gifts you got me, but I will admit I was disappointed because we all agreed to a budget to make it fair for everyone. I know it is not about the money spent, and I am truly grateful for what you got me, but I needed to voice to you how I felt because I felt very left out today because everyone elses secrect santa followed the budget. ""

I was left on read just minutes after sending that message.

My sister came into my work later on to eat, and I sat down with her and talked to her about it, and I showed her the text that I sent him. She got upset with me because "" I thought this was settled because Mom gave you money and I bought your work shoes for you."" I told her I was thankful that they both did that, but they did not have to do that whatsoever, and that it doesn't make up for Will barely getting me anything. 

Later that night, I did feel bad saying something to him about it because I knew he probably couldn't afford it, but why did he choose to participate if he wasn't going to fully participate? 

I am torn between feeling bad about saying anything to him and being upset about the lack of participation.

Heyy everyone, Regardless of whoever is looking this I hope that you are going through a good day! As for me I did have a pretty good day!, I went to gym and read some books, went out with my friends for a really good cup of coffee with dark chocolate. Did some swimming for a while until I had to go inside like a submarine because I almost hit another person haha. finally I'm gonna wrap my day up with a good movie I'm gonna watch!

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

1pwyyeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriouslyAITAH/comments/1pwyyeg/seriously_aitah_for_thinking_that_my_local/,Seriously AITAH for thinking that my local 7-Eleven either needs new management or to shut down completely?,"In the fall of 2022 a 7-Eleven opened up near my house, the first one ever in the neighborhood. Things were going okay at first, but at some point this 7-Eleven decided to stop selling the cheeseburger bites. I don't know about you but I personally think they are delicious. So when I asked them if they are going to be getting anymore in I neither got a yes or a no, just incomprehensible mumbling. I'd have gotten a better answer out of the slurpee machine. 

But that's just me being petty. If you go to Google reviews (Newport Ave. in Pawtucket, RI) there are several complaints about that particular 7-Eleven. One man complained that he got his little daughter a cheese pizza which was clearly labeled cheese pizza but when she bit into  it, it was laced with Jalepenos. He complained to the clerk who was quick to tell him they can't give him his money back, to which he said the money isn't the point it's the whole point that the pizza was mislabeled. They told him ""too bad"". Could it be an exaggeration? Possibly but reviews need to be taken seriously. 

I don't know if every 7-Eleven does this but after a certain time they take the chairs out of the lobby and lock them up, giving people no place to sit.

And finally, the most frequent complaint is that they close and lock up the store at around 2am with a written closed sign on the door. And it doesn't open back up until almost 7 in the morning. And there's no walk up window. Correct me if I am wrong but aren't 7-Elevens supposed to be open 24 hours? I asked this one time when I was out late and getting a coffee when I got basically shooed out of the place by the third shift girl who has a perpetually scared look on her  face and she said, ""we are open 24 hours but we close the lobby at 2am."" I said that is not being open 24 hours. Seriously if the graveyard shift scares her that much she should find another job.

So Seriously AITAH because I think they either need new management to do a little house cleaning or just shut it down and sell it to Cumberland Farms if they have no intention of being open 24 hours?",1,1766845319.0,SeriouslyAITAH,0,1.0,False

1pwywmc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pwywmc,Q4 Coffee 2025,"Hello [r/pourover](r/pourover), it’s me again ( [u/avagantamose](u/avagantamose) ) and I am back again in yet another 3 month period to drop some medium-sized reviews on a few of the coffees I have had, in hopes of having any type of discussion on the coffee! I would love feedback on any notes I have written if you all would allow it, so I can potentially improve the way I am describing what I am tasting in these cups. Reusing the same intro from my last post because lazy and I am doing the same thing: Mid-sized reviews of some great coffee! With the end of the year coming up, I want to wish you all a happy upcoming new year!

All of these cups were brewed on the Timemore C2 held BASICALLY horizontal, 22-24 clicks. 1:16 or 1:17 ratio, usually with 15-20g of coffee. Aiming for between 2:30-3:30 brew time on all, with a few seconds of deviation due to user error. All on the V60 with Cafec TH-3 papers (identical to the T-90). Used usually between 92-96C temperature with 1/3 TWW diluted in RO water, to get the specifics out of the way! \[Also 3-4 weeks of rest is usually what I get down with, outside of a cup immediately at two weeks out of impatience.\] - This was done a little bit differently this time around for a couple of these bags, as excitement got the better of me. 

**1. Sky Project Alo DJ1 Washed Ethiopian Landrace (74158) from 19CRL** \- I picked this up at a cupping in San Diego after trying about 9 different coffees that day. This one was my favorite of the beans available for sale that day, as it had the most floral aroma in my opinion. Soft pink/light red florals hit the nose immediately, reminds me of rose. Rather intense/pointed acidity hits at first taste, surprisingly with florals leaning more red, the citric acidity in the cup reminds me slightly of tangerine with the sweet aspect to it. I would even go as far to say jujube/pear is what this resembles quite a bit to me. I brewed this one at 1:17, very tea-like, almost no body if that was even possible. It has a malic acidity to it that seems to play well with the citric acidity in there. Somewhat reminding me of a ripe green apple sweetness - not the sweetest cup but it definitely could be the most floral! The linger is filled with those pink, sweet florals especially as the cup cools down and oddly enough, a purple grape note comes out. The tannins come out in the linger quite nicely, as this seems to mostly finish juicy, but with a slight grippy mouthfeel to a degree. I think this is a really special cup of coffee for what it is worth, I could list more notes but this really encompasses a wide variety of stonefruit, berry fruit and citric fruit qualities that you can pick out differently depending on the day. There is something to be said about Alo coffees, and that something is that they are phenomenal!

**2. Finca El Paraiso Diego Bermudez Birthday Cake by H&S Coffee Roasters** \- The cardamom aromatics in this while brewing AND while dry are so vivid. I broke into this one earlier than the recommended rest period from H&S due to having purchased it for the holiday season, and I think it was well worth it. You are immediately greeted with a spiced characteristic that can only be described as cardamom with a creaminess that is really only like eggnog or maybe even reminiscent of chai. The birthday cake note on this one is interesting, as I think it more pertains to the sweetness, as this is critically sweet. Baked pear does not do the sweetness justice, as there is a nice lactic acidity giving you an insanely creamy mouthfeel with an overtone of that classic PB brightness. Using a Pink Bourbon is definitely more adherent to my preference than a Castillo or a Gesha for these insane Bermudez coffees, as the tropical fruit notes shine through better than say chocolatey notes with a Castillo or floral notes with a Gesha. The tropical fruit aspect to me, is if you coated canned pineapple slices in brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves and cardamom. Personally, I think this is levels above “Milky Cake.” I know DAK had “cardamom bun” as well (did not have the chance to taste it, sadly) but this cup really reminds me of a cardamom bun, the spiced quality coupled with the raw sugary sweetness really emphasizes the pastry-esque qualities of these beans. The creaminess mixed with the cardamom/caramelized fruit qualities of this one are such a great holiday combination. H&S did tell me that they potentially could be getting more of this one AND IF THEY DID, I will be acquiring more of it. 

**3. Jose & Pepe Jijon Finca Surya Washed Mejorado from Thankfully Coffee** \- Vanilla florals is a note on this bag and I would argue it hits the nail on the head. Up front are immediate white florals, very delicate and reminiscent of vanilla/white tea/chrysanthemum combo. This is a coffee I let sit for about 60 days before I decided to really comment on the profile of the cup, and I think the wait was worth the results. I do not pick up much mango in the cup as I wouldn’t say the flavor is there nor is the mouthfeel one would usually associate with a mango note. Citrusy sweetness similar to an orange or maybe even a tangerine, very sweet. If Fanta had an orange creamsicle flavor, I could say that would be an outlandish note to throw on this bag. I could also argue that the linger contains a soft sweetness similar to a Bartlett pear. Back to what matters here, the vanilla florality in this cup is exceptional. I couldn’t recall a cup I have had, that has had such a dominant vanilla presence to it. Lightly tannic on the back end of the cup, hence a white tea note on my end. I think the lot separation of Fincas del Putushio is really cool, happy to have gotten my hands on this Finca Surya from Thankfully, such a phenomenal coffee and a phenomenal roast. One of the cleanest coffee’s that I have had the pleasure to experience this year.

**4. Ratnagiri Estate Honey Selection 9 from Ceto Coffee Roasters** \- While dry and while brewing, I was impressed with the aromatics coming off of this coffee, kind of insane! You can see the strawberry/red fruits in that smell coming across a slight bit funky, but not enough to be off putting. Had a bit of a dark chocolate feel to it as well, really reminding me of an Ethiopian natural in that way, as well as not being the *cleanest* aroma. The top note on this being Dandelion does not really make any sense to me, as I do not pickup any yellow  florals in the cup, nor do I find this cup to be insanely earthy in any way. The cup comes across well with a pleasant strawberry/mixed berry sweetness with a trace of a candied element in that flavor. Despite that, there is a SLIGHT bitterness that reminds me of that pineapple note listed on the bag. Interesting combination of malic acidity reminding me of apple cider with a slight spiced characteristic to it, as well as some lactic acidity which really transforms this coffee in my opinion, super silky cup borderline creamy. Think perhaps of a strawberry-apple-mixed berry smoothie! Like I stated at first, the funk (both in aroma and taste) to this reminds me of a current natural Ethiopian (not a particularly clean one) in the way it is rather berry forward in flavor. Round, silky, I would put ripe raspberry as a note on here as well, this cup is primarily a red/yellow cup. Slightly tannic toward the end of the cup, more-so in a way that the body has a slight grippy mouthfeel after coating your mouth in a buttery way. The linger on this is probably my least favorite part, it is slightly earthy reminding me of something akin to a sweet tobacco. This is my first experience with Indian coffee and I am looking forward to many more, as this coffee teeters a red/yellow fruit profile in quite a lovely way.

**5. Hachi Kōhaku Washed Panamanian Caturra from Shoebox Coffee Roasters** \- Up front vanilla aromatics while brewing, some florals and a little bit of lemon. Pronounced citric acidity in the cup reminding me slightly of blood orange leaning into a more yuzu citric flavor. White/yellow florals (not sure if I have ever smelled a chrysanthemum, however, that and osmanthus are my favorite floral notes, besides a tea note) are in the linger, super similar to an herbal tea of sorts. Very much my preference for something like this with medium-high acidity to have such a pronounced lemon-lime sweetness, with a delicate floral finish/linger to it. As the cup cools down, this starts to remind me of gooseberries in the sweetness, as well as some dragonfruit in there as well, incredibly delicate. The introduction of some tannins in the back end of the cup give this a nice grippy mouthfeel. It is a little unfortunate that the vanilla from the brewing stage somewhat fell off in the brewed cup itself, but what we lost in vanilla we make up for in berry sweetness and a 7/10 level of citric acidity to compliment that. Brewing this one on December 18, roast date of November 5 I think this one may still have some time to open up, maybe about a week or so. This “boring washed caturra” is definitely not boring at all, I think this offers an astoundingly clean experience considering the depth of this coffee.

**6. Wilson Alba Pink Bourbon from Flower Child Coffee Roasters** \- This is one of the first two coffees I received from the Flower Child subscription, which I will be retaining for the foreseeable future. Bright red fruits and red florals are immediately what I get from the aroma and first sip. Ripe raspberry coupled with some lemon-like acidity is the best thing I would call it, moderately tart. Leans sweet as if you are sipping on some agua de jamaica or even just some sweetened hibiscus tea. As the cup cools down, I get some stone-fruit out of this like the listed tasting notes, reminds me of apricot, plum, maybe even leaning into the ruby grapefruit aspect in the citric acidity sense. Evolves into a red starburst like sweetness with a ripe strawberry-esque acidity as the cup drops down to slightly warmer than room temperature, a true red-yellow cup if I had to say so. Red florals like rose towards the end of the cup, reminds me a touch of a Kenyan coffee in the finish/linger as well as the brightness. Very enjoyable and very lovable. Brewed at a 1:16 ratio for this review, however, I have lengthened the ratio multiple times and have surprisingly gotten similar tasting notes along the way.

**7. Masha Washing Station Washed Red Bourbon from Ceto Coffee Roasters** \- The lime acidity + sweetness hits you right from the jump on this one, super zippy and well presented. This one is basically just lemon-lime juice with a nice purple/floral backing to it. Floral note stated is violet, I can see lilac, lavender, a TOUCH of green tea is presented in the finish of the cup. Tannins similar to green tea, this is a very pointed cup. Not round, not dry but relatively balanced in terms of the mouthfeel. Somewhat of a bergamot/white grapefruit undertone shines past the sweetness while hot, but when the cup cools down, the lime/lemon sweetness pushes through with more strength than the initial few sips when hot. Definitely sweeter when sitting at room temperature, however, the florals slightly die down in favor of the citrus fruit while cooled off. Limeade feel to it while cool. This is the 2nd Burundi selection I have ever tried, the first being last year from Sweet Bloom (also a washed Bourbon) and this puts that offering to shame, with all respect to Sweet Bloom. This is one of the last coffees I am having this year, but I can argue it would fit in the top 10-15 that I have tried this year. The citric flavors are at the forefront, not much stone/berry fruit flavor there at all. Quite an acidic cup, I think if you LOVE citric forward coffees, you would be in for a treat with this one.",9,1766845187.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

But pleeease give me some feedback, no need to hold back. Call me an idiot if you must (only if you must, I still have feelings)

Dont mind the timestamps, thats mainly there as a suggestion.

We'll leave Mysuru on 31 morning for Bengaluru.

What’s the best way to get around Mysore with parents? Auto, Uber/Ola, or local taxis?  
Is this itinerary realistic pace-wise, or am I overdoing any day?  
Are there any must-visit spots in Mysore that I’m missing and should strongly consider?  
Any food places I should not miss?  
Any precautions to keep in mind? I know the usual auto guy says the cathedral is having lunch break go to this shop scam.

Any and all help appreciated. Thanks in advance!",5,1766845073.0,mysore,5,1.0,False

What if she’s been showing El and everyone illusions this whole time? What if Henry/Vecna isn’t even real and it’s just her playing games with everyone, creating another monster in people’s heads when really she’s the monster? What if the Upside Down is an illusion? 

And now she wants El to kill herself… I think Kali knows Eleven is a threat to HER evil plans. 

This is my coffee and contemplation time right now! 🤭 ☕️  Does anyone else think something similar? 🙊",5,1766845027.0,StrangerThings,7,0.69,False

1pwytxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1pwytxa/terrible_transit_makes_me_look_bad_on_my_first/,Terrible transit makes me look bad on my first day of work....,"So i was supposed to start a new job today, start time at 9am, so i got my coffee and was at the bus stop 20mins early for my bus, and sure enough, it didnt show up, so i stayed and waited for the next one in 30mins, that one didnt show either, waited for the one after that, you guessed it, No show. 

How the fuck are people supposed to get to work if you dont run your busses when you say you will, and when people try to call you to see whats going on, you dont pick up the phone? Like seriously, what the fuck. I understand this is a rural area but transit is not novelty, people actually use this shit to get places and now youve just cost me a days wages, because i had to keep calling and delaying my shift was cancelled. 

Its not even like theirs a major winter storm going on, We did get a crap ton of snow and ice yesterday but all the roads the bus would use are completely clean and clear. Oh and of course the shelter isnt much help either, theyll gladly drive other residents to stuff or get them a cab, but the one time i need it after living here issue free for as long as i have, ofc they cant help me get to work, no no. That would mean im on the way to not being homeless anymore. 

Im fucking fed right the fuck up if you couldnt tell. Especially because yesterday, same transit agency, the bus i was on took a corner way too fast and slammed into a pole right where i was sitting. Wonder why anyone who dosent have to use transit, dosent use it? This is why. Its only for the poor, desperate and homeless who cant do anything about their shitty unreliable expensive service, if your charging me $5.50 for a ride, i expect it to show up on time and actually get me to where i need to be. 

Not actively sabotaging my employment on the very first day. ",1,1766844983.0,homeless,2,0.6,False
