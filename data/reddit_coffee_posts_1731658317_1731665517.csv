I went to meet a girl from Bumble as I wasn't 100% sure she was scamming and I was curious about the process. We agreed to meet at the Starbucks roastery. 

I made her wait 30min because Google maps bamboozled me, which makes things harder since I can't know if she went in during the wait, but ofc the red flags continue. She doesn't drink coffee and just wanted to visit, and looks older/slightly different than the photos. She speaks a decent english and ask me where I want to go though. 3 minutes in it becomes obvious, she is just not natural and becomes nervous when I open Dianping thinking I can read Chinese.

Anyways she wechat her Friend and wants to go by herself, I say yeah good luck for the next scam thinking to continue my day. What I didnt expect is that she started freaking out in public, grabbing me with impressive strength and trying to get my phone. For some reason she was afraid I took pictures and said she was calling the police, Indeed making a call. Is there a worst case scenario for me, like can she sell a lie to the police or hit herself ?

1grt447,https://i.redd.it/jv1obc3gh11e1.jpeg,My first setup - still trying to figure it out,"
Hello guys, I have just started my journey with a Profitec go and a df64 gen 2 grinder. Before this I only used a cheap Delonghi Dedica with a pressurized basket.

Of course I am now at the point where I have more questions than answers.
My machine came with software version 1.09.
I think that the steam wand is also a no burn but I was unable to remove the tip in order to confirm this. It is very much stuck, I might have to use a wrench on it?

Has anyone checked if changing e1 offset value is also required in this version? Mine came from the factory set to 14C.
Also, what is the basket size of the original double? I have found answers going all the way from 14 to 20 grams. I tend to stick to 18 grams for now, medium roast coffee and default 93C pid temp. I am getting wet pucks but I understand that this is pretty normal for this machine.

If someone here wants to share some tips and tricks for this machine and espresso in general I am more than happy to read them. I haven’t yet managed to get a very good tasting espresso out of it, but to be fair I have never really tasted good espresso in my life and not sure what to expect. Coffee beans used are also fresh, about 10 days passed from roasting.

1grt282,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1grt282/i_saw_someone_in_my_house_on_my_pet_cam_while_i/,I saw someone in my house on my pet cam while I was out tonight,"I live alone with my dog, Max. He’s my world—always has been. He’s been my constant through everything: bad breakups, endless nights of anxiety, the crushing loneliness of a city where people don’t make eye contact. He’s the reason I get out of bed most days. I installed a dog cam for him a few months back, mostly to check in while I’m out. He doesn’t love being alone, and the camera’s mic lets me talk to him if he gets anxious.

Tonight, I had to leave for a couple of hours, nothing unusual. I always leave the TV on for Max—usually some nature channel because it calms him. But just before I left, the news caught my attention.

The anchor’s voice was serious. She was talking about disappearances—single men and their dogs, all gone without a trace. They think it’s a copycat killer mimicking the ""Burned Man,"" some psychopath from the 70s. He used to lure men into his traps before killing them and burning their bodies. Vigilantes eventually got him, burned him alive in some twisted form of justice. Supposedly, he laughed as he burned.

I don’t believe in ghosts or anything like that, but hearing the story unsettled me. I glanced at Max lying on the couch, wagging his tail lazily, oblivious. I switched the channel to something light—a cheerful cooking show—and knelt to scratch behind his ears.

“You’ll be fine, buddy. Daddy will be home soon,” I said.

I wish I hadn’t said that.



I wasn’t even halfway through the night before I checked the dog cam. I always check. It’s a bad habit—I just hate leaving Max alone too long. At first, everything seemed normal. He was lying on the couch, his tail twitching as he watched the TV.

Then he started pacing.

He kept looking toward the corner of the room, where the shadows always seemed a little too dark. His ears were flat, his tail tucked low. I’ve never seen him act like that before. He barked—a deep, frantic bark I didn’t recognize.

I tapped the mic. “Max? It’s okay, buddy. What’s wrong?”

He froze, his eyes darting toward the camera, then back to the corner. And then, out of nowhere, the barking stopped. He whimpered and backed into the farthest corner of the room.

I stared at the screen, feeling my stomach twist. Something moved in the shadows. It was faint at first—just a flicker—but then it stepped into the light.

It wasn’t human—or if it was, it shouldn’t be alive. It was tall and impossibly thin, its pale, cracked skin glowing faintly, like embers buried beneath ash. Its face was stretched, hollow-eyed, with a smile that didn’t belong on any living thing. It tilted its head as if studying Max. He pressed himself against the wall, trembling.

Then the thing turned to the camera.

It stepped closer, filling the frame. Its eyes—if you can call them that—were black pits, staring straight at me through the screen. Its mouth stretched into an even wider grin, jagged teeth visible now. And then it spoke.

Through the camera mic.

*“Come home soon, Daddy. I’ve got a surprise for you.”*



I don’t even remember the drive home. I think I was running on autopilot, pure adrenaline. By the time I unlocked the front door, I was already calling for Max.

The house was eerily quiet. The TV was still on, but the sound seemed muffled, distant. Max was lying under the coffee table, shaking. His ears were pinned back, his eyes fixed on the hallway. I crouched down and tried to coax him out, but he wouldn’t budge.

“Max, come on, it’s okay,” I whispered, but even my voice sounded hollow.

Then I smelled it.

Smoke.

It was faint at first, like the lingering scent of a burned-out candle. But it got stronger as I stood up and followed Max’s gaze toward the hallway. My heart was pounding as I grabbed a flashlight and walked toward the laundry room.

The smell hit me hard as I stepped inside. The air was thick, suffocating, and then I saw the wall.

*BOO.*

The word was smeared across the wall in uneven letters, written in something black and gritty, like ash. My hand shook as I shined the flashlight closer. The texture was rough, almost sticky, and the smell of burning intensified.

I heard a dragging sound behind me. My breath caught as I turned the flashlight toward the noise, but nothing was there. The hallway was empty.



**Edit: 1:37 a.m.**  
I’ve locked myself in my bedroom with Max. He’s lying on the bed, but he won’t stop staring at the door. I keep hearing footsteps in the hallway. They’re slow, deliberate. Every now and then, the handle rattles, like someone’s trying to turn it.

I called the police, but they said it would take time for someone to get here. I don’t think I have time.



**Edit: 2:13 a.m.**  
The smoke is getting worse. It’s not in the room yet, but I can smell it, like something burning just outside the door.

Max is gone. I don’t know how—he was right here. The door didn’t open. The window’s locked. He’s just… gone.

The footsteps are back, heavier now.



**Edit: 2:27 a.m.**  
I’m watching the dog cam footage. It doesn’t make sense. The figure is there again, standing in the living room, but it’s looking straight at the camera. At me.

It smiled.

Then it said, *“You’re too late, Daddy.”*

The screen went black.



**Edit: 2:42 a.m.**  
The footsteps are outside my door. The handle just turned.

I think this is it.

If anyone finds this, please…

He’s still out there.

And he’s waiting for you—if you’re a single man living alone with your dog.",3,1731664876.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Everything was perfect. A little backstory: his sister and I have been friends for 3+ years before we even met.
She was kind, had her issues, but overall nice towards me. We were best friends. She has an older brother (my fiancé) that I have never met before. I had relationships, so l didn't want to meet anyone and give them hope or a chance while I was in relationships. At the end of last year, I broke up with my bf at that time. For context purposes, the sister is married and has a kid with her husband. Anyways we met and started dating, not a long time passed, we were inseparable, felt like he was my soulmate. In July he proposed to me and I said yes. I wanted him to be my husband because he was the only man I could ever see a future with. I felt his sister being distant the moment we got engaged. She stopped talking to me, she stopped texting me. I just thought she was busy with the kid or her husband or her life so I didn't wanna bother her. We planned a vacation by the end of that month. I have 20 days of payed vacation at the firm I work at, and I took 16 of them to travel and be with him.
We planned it all out, and he said he'll take care of it. Two days before the vacation, he switches plans and didn't go to the desired place (Italy) but somewhere else. I wasn't complaining, because I wanted to be with him, I didn't care where we were as long as we were together. His sister that didn't live in the same country as us knew our plans. She knew when my vacation would take place and where we will go, etc. About 6-7 days into vacation he told me we needed to go back home because of a family emergency and money issues, so we went back. When we got back home his sister came for a visit. With the kid.
Without the husband. The kid was about 9mo at that time. So I didn't think much of it. Kept going with our lives. But something felt weird. I always felt like there was something more behind the vacation and the us going back 10 days early. Sooo a couple of months pass. It's November. We are planning a wedding, and he was out with my dad for a coffee to talk about the details, when my dad, knowing how much it hurt me for ruining my vacation, asked him why he left early and what could ve been so important.

He came clean and told my dad it was due to his sisters visit and the nephew. I died inside.
Because he had been lying to me this whole time. I wanted him to put me as a priority and be with me, but he didn't. So now, when I found that out, and found out that she has been telling him badly about me, spreading lies, talking about my past relationships, I wanted him to not contact her. Now this is probably irrelevant, but she didn’t like any of our posts together and when I confronted him about it, he ran to tell her what I figured out, and he said he never even realized what was happening.Am I the asshole for making him choose between me, his future wife, or his sister that doesn’t want him to be with me and doesn’t want him happy?",0,1731664826.0,AmItheAsshole,5,0.5,False

I spawn in Rosewood (my comfort zone) as a burglar (also my comfort pick). I beeline for the fire station to pick up an axe, set up a temporary base in one of the apartments above the shops, clear out the supermarket, then find a decent car to hijack and drive down to the food warehouses just past the drive-in movie theatre, all the while pounding raw coffee grounds to keep myself awake and gummy candy to numb the depression brought on by the raw coffee grounds. I fill the car up with as many sacks of fresh vegetables as I can squeeze in there (prioritising potatoes, tomatoes and onions as they take longer to spoil), speed back to the supermarket and cram it all into the freezers.

This has worked out relatively well for me so far, but I'm wondering if there aren't more efficient ways to spend my first few days of the apocalypse. The trip usually causes me to miss an episode of Life and Living and while I know there's technically enough non-perishable food on the map to keep me going almost indefinitely, I get weirdly into cooking in almost every game that has it and the thought of all those perfectly good veggies going to waste hurts me emotionally.

I'm posting on behalf of Wobbly Socials, you may have seen us pop up in this sub reddit before but if not we're a Bristol based non profit aiming to reduce isolation both in Bristol and online by hosting social events for anyone who feels a bit 'wobbly' about socialising. 

We've been running a regular board game night once a month at Bristol Folk House for the past few months and we have one more coming up before the end of the year. Usually these take place on the last Monday of every month but this one is on the 11th December at 6pm. 

Tickets are linked below if you're interested! We ask for a small donation (which you can set at any amount) to cover volunteer costs but everything donated goes back to the organisation.

We also run a regular walking group at various locations across Bristol. This is completely free to attend and our next one is this Sunday meeting at the Downs Water Tower.

We all usually go for a coffee afterwards, this month at the gorgeous Edgie Eats cafe, and there's always great conversation.

Everyone's in the same boat when attending our events and everyone has their own unique reason for being there. We get younger people, older people, men, women, neurodiverse and LGBTQ+ folk. We've had parents, people who have just moved to the city, people working 60 hour weeks who haven't had time to socialise and much much more. Everyone is welcome and everyone feels isolated or a bit unsure about socialising sometimes so don't hesitate to get involved if you think this could be supportive for you.

Now I just realised that I am using a reusable cotton coffee filter when making coffee and that works quite well. So that got me thinking: can I either make a brewbag myself or get one commissioned from organic unbleached cotton?

Does anyone have experience with this? If so, how much gram per m2 cotton did you use, and what max size would you recommend?

Checked in the last few days and realized… how selfish! 

How are y’all doing today? I feel like this isn’t exactly a sub that newly sober people find, but I bet Friday has some special zing to it nevertheless, and I thought it might be interesting to hear what people are doing with this wonderful day that heralds a whole weekend?

Me, I’m playing nursemaid (the wife is recovering great, it’s really just time now) and trying to apply “one day at a time” to my racing mind—political opinions aside we can all agree changes are coming. I was raised with chess and by 7 could regularly beat my father at 45, and my grandfather (a combat veteran and commander) at 70. I’ve run a couple planning offices and it’s generally been an element of my job. Thinking ahead is in my nature. I was also a boxer: it really shapes how you think.

I usually start with a standard scenario planning grid and then work my way down knowns and unknowns. The unknowns are just huge—which sharply limits the moves to make. Strange moment.

To me this means it’s time to let the mind go clear. It’s like the time before a match with someone you haven’t studied. You don’t know if it’s an Ali or a Foreman. Obviously you’d rather have studied, but since you can’t the best thing is to still your mind so you’re best able to respond to whatever happens.

So, one day at a time: set a timer for Reddit finally. Too much coffee the last few days: time to start cutting that out too. There’s cigs and sugar too but later, another day for those ones.

Ran a mile yesterday. Didn’t die, was proud of that. Running another today. 

Meditation. Different forms throughout the day. Breathing practice. Paying attention to my posture—standing tall eventually makes you feel a little less low. 

Was on a minor detox, now it feels metaphorically endowed. Taking activated charcoal to draw toxins out… the world may be toxic but I don’t have to be! 

So what’s your Friday looking like?

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

So I (17m) have been working at a cafe for probably 3 months now. I work only 3 hours on Saturday mornings due to school commitments. I have another job at a winery which is primarily seasonal in its work but pays very well and before these 2 jobs I worked in a restaurant for about a year and a half. The thought behind working at a cafe was to learn how to make coffees and whatnot in case I needed work while at university or away from home. I had only the job at the winery at the time and so was HEAVILY advised by my parents to get a stable income. They are good friends with the owners of the cafe and got me a job there (a similar thing happened at my first job too). 

Unfortunately, I have been hating on the job since I started. At first, I thought it was just because it was a new environment. Then, as the weeks continued and the discomfort stayed, I thought it was because I kept messing up and misunderstanding simple tasks that my bosses expected me to remember from previous weeks. Then I thought it was the customers. Then my coworkers and bosses (there aren’t many). But my discomfort grew to hate and escalated to me sometimes having small anxiety attacks while thinking about working.

Also, recently me and my family have been questioning ADD or something like that as a reason for my failings at the cafe and my distractedness in school as Year 12 and adulting rolls around the corner. I haven’t been diagnosed yet but my GP says it's likely.

I’ve talked to my parents about my view on the job and, after I had come home and broke down in tears after I messed up heaps that day at work (mishearing, not hearing and misunderstanding instructions, forgetting to interact correctly with customers, forgetting orders and drinks and how to make them), they talked to my bosses about it, who said that I was a gem to work with and that I was doing a great job, albeit with a few mistakes. They also have worked with and are parents to people who have ADHD and autism.

So my parents are telling me that my worries are “all in my head” and that I’ve got to put on my “big boy pants and suck it up because that’s just how all the other adults do it”. 

Ik I need consistent money, this job was a last resort after trying resumes at many other workplaces, but I don’t think that this is going well for my mental health. Even if I just picked the job back up once I’m fixed. I can still work at the winery in the meantime. And it’s not like I’m broke.

Messing with my head at the moment is a lot of Year 12 major works, assessments and the end-of-year exams, gender and sexuality instability in a Catholic school, friendships, the potential for ADHD or ADD, and the oncoming adult world and responsibilities. I am also (not to brag) the ‘golden eldest child’ of the family, always respectful, school leader, good grades, etc etc.

So, given all of that, AITA for wanting to quit my job?



P.S. I’m not sure if ADD is the right term for the not-hyperactive ADHD so I am super sorry if I have offended anyone by being incorrect <3",74,1731662506.0,AITAH,11,0.97,False

Mindfulness Practices to Embrace on October 21
----------------------------------------------

On October 21, take a moment to pause and embrace mindfulness practices that can enrich your day and improve your mental well-being. Mindfulness is all about being present, aware, and fully engaged in the current moment. Here are some mindful practices to consider integrating into your routine on this day.

### Breath Awareness

One of the simplest yet most powerful mindfulness techniques is breath awareness. Start by finding a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes gently and take a deep breath in through your nose, allowing your tummy to expand. Exhale through your mouth. Repeat this process several times and focus solely on your breath. If your mind wanders, gently bring your focus back to your breathing. This practice can help you feel centered and stress-free.

Check Details Here: https://astrologyalignment.com/just-for-today-october-21  
  
### Mindful Walking

Walking can be an excellent form of mindfulness. Choose a quiet path, whether it's a local park or your neighborhood. As you walk, pay attention to each step you take. Feel the ground beneath your feet, notice the rhythm of your body, and observe the sights and sounds around you. Engage all your senses to truly connect with the experience of walking. This can transform a mundane task into an opportunity for peace and reflection.

### Gratitude Journaling

Expressing gratitude can significantly boost your mood and mental health. Take a few moments on October 21 to jot down three things you are grateful for today. They can be as simple as a delicious cup of coffee, a call from a friend, or the beauty of nature. Reflecting on positive aspects of your day helps shift your mindset and encourages a more optimistic outlook. It’s beneficial not only for your mental state but also for your overall well-being.

### Meditative Visualization

Visualization is a powerful technique that can enhance your mindfulness practice. Find a quiet space, sit comfortably, and close your eyes. Imagine a serene place, like a peaceful beach or a calming forest. Visualize every detail: the colors, sounds, and scents enveloping you. Allow yourself to feel as if you are truly there. This practice can provide immediate tranquility and help you deal with stress more effectively.

### Body Scan Meditation

A body scan is an excellent way to connect with your physical state and promote relaxation. Begin by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and start focusing on your toes. Notice any sensations or tension there, then consciously relax that area. Gradually move up through your body—your feet, legs, abdomen, and so on—until you reach the top of your head. This mindfulness practice not only relieves physical tension but can also increase your awareness of how your body feels.

### Mindful Eating

Appreciate the colors, textures, and flavors of your food. Chew slowly and notice how the food nourishes you. This mindful approach to eating can improve digestion and enhance your appreciation for the meals you consume.

### Engaging in Nature

Spending time in nature can be incredibly grounding. On this day, consider visiting a local park, garden, or natural setting. Take a few moments to observe your surroundings. Listen to the birds, feel the breeze on your skin, and watch the leaves rustling in the wind. Nature offers a chance to reconnect and recharge your mind and body.

# Two boards and 1/4-in. plywood

This under-cabinet drawer really is a simple project.

Use poplar for all the parts because the exposed parts will be painted to match the cabinets.

# Side-mount drawer slides made easy

Ordinarily, installing drawers with side-mount slides is very challenging. But with this technique, everything is built around the drawer, making it very easy.

Most upper cabinets are 12 in. deep. So we suggest you can choose our [soft close drawer slides](https://vadania.com/collections/residential-drawer-slides/products/vk1245-soft-closing-slides) or [push to open drawer slides](https://vadania.com/collections/residential-drawer-slides/products/vf1245-push-to-open-slides) for this project.

# The cavity defines the drawer sizes

Peek under your cabinets and you’ll see the cavities. You can put several drawers under a row of cabinets if you wish, but each cabinet needs a separate drawer. If you’re putting in adjoining drawers, hold off on cutting the drawer fronts until all the drawers are installed so you can cut them to fit with even gaps between them.

For single cabinet drawers, go ahead and cut the fronts the same length as the cabinet drawers face. You won’t need any drawer pulls. Because the drawer front drops about an inch below the drawer, you’ll have a built-in lip on the underside for a finger pull.

1. Size the drawer

https://preview.redd.it/k2fykyvn711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=84f870af9f985cb2081525821efa6838cd8f98db

Measure the cavity under the cabinet and cut a piece of 1/4-in. plywood 2-1/2 in. narrower and 1/4 in. shallower than those dimensions.

1. Build the drawer frame

https://preview.redd.it/6abs7jzo711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=97cd812b738a55d536be6b20573af09d830d533b

Cut 1×3 frame parts to match the plywood dimensions, then glue and nail them together with 1-1/2-in. 18-gauge brads.

1. Add the drawer bottom

https://preview.redd.it/7xxfe63q711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=98ab0fcf7285514a6cead0eec8935af4d6a8b38b

Glue and nail the plywood to the frame using the plywood to square up the frame as you fasten it.

1. Attach the drawer slide

https://preview.redd.it/o8jprdyq711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f43261299d23379529cfc395435f137a886015

Cut two 1x4s to the same length as the drawer sides, then attach the slides to the drawer supports, holding them flush with the bottom and the end. Use a self-centering drill bit in the round slide mounting holes before sinking the 1/2-in. screws.

1. Join the slide to the drawer

https://preview.redd.it/3q9l23rr711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ab54241135069f872b0499980f2a1424b41bd6

Pull out the slide on each drawer support a few inches to expose the mounting holes, then predrill and screw the slides to the drawer sides flush with the front.

1. Finish attaching the drawer slide

https://preview.redd.it/y3c162ms711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c7b5f81e56565ffb3690fdd53be5f8612d9c039

Pull the slide out the rest of the way to mount the slide to the back end of the drawer.

1. Stick the assembly to the cabinet

https://preview.redd.it/f9rx228t711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3e955201c64f869ac44b91fbbe2209fc6ff8542

Use double-face tape to temporarily stick the assembly to the underside of the cabinet. (Center it in the opening.)

1. Screw the drawer supports to the cabinet bottom

https://preview.redd.it/kguhuavt711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa37ca73018ce228009a54c1dc446c085b9a5687

Drill two 1/8-in. pilot holes through the cabinet bottom, then screw into the drawer supports.

1. Stick on the drawer front

https://preview.redd.it/fkeeyzfu711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9125fa0cad13ea799936f17599dde840d0d5ad84

Cut the 1×4 drawer front exactly the same length as the cabinet face frame. Use two nickels to space it from the cabinet frame while you attach it with double-face tape.

1. Attach the drawer front

https://preview.redd.it/pa78li7v711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc337cee124bb73bef852451ae1d5426a53c63e9

Drill, then permanently attach the drawer front to the drawer frame from the inside with 1-1/4-in. screws.

1. Clamp and screw the side trim into place

https://preview.redd.it/b5gm244x711e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e15c4efbaaac436057a1778ff390d4074a313c42

Drill pilot holes above the drawer slide and attach the side trim with 1-1/4-in. screws.

Before you adhere and screw the assembly onto the cabinet, have someone help you hold it in place to make sure the drawer clears the cabinet face frame. If it doesn’t, rip 3/4-in. strips of 1/4-in. plywood for spacers (as many as needed) and nail them to the drawer support before mounting the assembly.",1,1731661940.0,u_Leafloat,0,1.0,False

* I didn’t notice any significant effects in the first two days.

* After day 2, I began feeling slightly better. On day 3, the pressure on the left side of my head eased up a bit.
* My skin lesions have dimmed down, and my stomach aches, bloating, and inflammation are improving day by day.
* Over the last 3-4 days, the head pressure around my temples has reduced significantly (though still there).
* My mind is clearing up. I’m talking, thinking, and acting faster, with less of the stalling I had with my long COVID self.
* My vision has slightly improved. I gave steroid eye drops another shot, and this time, they’re working—my vision clears up after use, and the redness fades.
* I’ve slowly reintroduced light coffee over the last three days, and it hasn’t caused any issues like it used to (no bathroom emergencies or bad reactions).
* That ""allergic redness"" on my ribs has also started to fade.

If this progress keeps up, I’m planning to slowly reintroduce normal foods into my diet after a few months.

**Extra details for anyone curious:**

* Still on a no-oil, no-sugar diet, eating only whole boiled food.
* Taking a multivitamin to cover any deficiencies.
* Introduced a less acidic yogurt before starting isotretinoin. Some brands made things worse (felt more sour), but I found one that didn’t irritate me, so I stuck with it. It felt rough at first but got better over time, and now I feel better when I eat it.

**Questions I have:**

1. Why is isotretinoin helping me like this? Could it be MCAS, inflammation, or something else? Is there a proper treatment for whatever is going on? I’ve read it can cause depression, but for me, my mood has been improving.
2. Given my symptoms and this unusual reaction to isotretinoin, is it better to see an immunologist, endocrinologist, or maybe another specialist?",3,1731661604.0,covidlonghaulers,1,1.0,False
1grsd4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1grsd4n/the_phone/,the phone ,"“Mommy, can I use your phone? I want to play Minecraft,” I ask, pulling on her sleeve. She looks down at me with that tired face she always makes when I ask her for something.
“Not right now, sweetie. I need it,” she says, turning back to her computer.

I groan and stomp off to my room. I hate when she says no. There’s nothing fun to do, and I don’t even have my tablet anymore because she took it away last night.

I sit on the floor and drag over my big bucket of Legos. It’s heavy, but I get it open and dump all the pieces out onto the rug. I start stacking them into a tower, making it as tall as my arm. But then I decide it’s a castle. I put some walls on it, a red piece for the gate, and even a little blue block on top like a flag.

After a while, I get bored. I push the Legos around with my hand and glance toward the door. Mommy’s still busy, but maybe she’ll let me use her phone this time if I ask again.

I get up and walk back to the living room. “Mommy, please? I’ll be super careful!”

She sighs and looks at me like she’s thinking. Then she picks up her old phone from the table and hands it to me. “Here. You can play with this, but just for a little while. And remember, no Minecraft—it doesn’t have internet.”

“Okay!” I grab it and run back to my room, holding it with both hands so I don’t drop it.

I plop down on my bed and turn the phone on. The screen lights up, but there’s not much to do. Most of the apps don’t work, and the games are boring. Then I find the green phone icon. It looks like the one on Mommy’s phone, so I tap it.

A bunch of numbers pop up on the screen, all lined up like on a calculator. I don’t know who to call, so I just press random buttons. One, two, three, four… I keep going until there’s a long line of numbers filling the box. It looks silly, but it makes me laugh.

I press the green button to see what happens.

The screen changes, and it starts ringing.

I hold the phone up to my ear to listen.

The phone rings a few more times, and I’m just about to hang up when I hear someone pick up.

“Hello?” I say, smiling a little. I don’t know who’s on the other end, but it’s exciting.

There’s silence for a second. Then, all of a sudden, a man’s voice shouts, loud and panicked:

“OH SHIT, THEY FOUND US!”

The sound nearly makes me drop the phone. My hand tightens around it, and I sit up straighter on the bed. In the background, I hear what sounds like a bunch of people running. Their footsteps thud, and voices overlap as they yell things I can’t quite make out. It’s chaos—loud, messy chaos—like the cartoons where people are running around in every direction at once.

I hold the phone tighter, my heart beating weird and fast. “Uh… hello?” I say again, quieter this time.

No one answers. The man’s voice keeps shouting things I don’t understand, and the running noises get louder, like they’re coming closer. There’s a crash, like something big fell over, and then someone screams.

I don’t know what’s going on. It doesn’t sound like a prank, but it doesn’t sound real either. I lean closer to the phone, trying to hear better.

The noise keeps going—shouting, running, things breaking. It feels like forever, but it’s only about two minutes before it all stops.

The phone makes a weird beeping sound, and the call disconnects. I stare at the screen, my stomach feeling funny. I don’t know what just happened, but it wasn’t what I expected.

I sit there for a second, staring at the phone. My hands are shaking a little, and my heart feels like it's beating too fast. What just happened?

I don’t know what that was, but it scared me. The voices, the running, it all felt too real. I try to forget about it, but I keep hearing it in my head, like it’s still happening.

I get up and walk out of my room, still holding the phone. My feet feel heavy, like they don’t want to move. I don’t want to look behind me, but I do. The phone is still on, and I feel a little sick in my stomach.

When I get to the living room, Mommy is sitting on the couch, typing on her computer.

“I’m done with the phone,” I say, my voice quiet.

She looks at me, surprised. “You’re done so soon?”

I shrug, not looking at her. “Yeah, I was bored,” I lie, handing her the phone.

She takes it without saying anything else. I turn around and walk back to my room, still feeling weird. I sit down on the floor with my Legos, but I don’t really play. I can’t stop thinking about the call, about the yelling and the running.

I try to focus on my Legos, but every time I close my eyes, I hear those footsteps and the voices. I feel like something’s watching me, but I don’t know what.

The next morning, I wake up early and run downstairs to get my cereal. Mommy’s in the kitchen, making her coffee. I sit at the table, eating and talking to her about nothing.

After breakfast, I go outside to play. I forget all about the phone and the weird call. It’s a nice day, and I run around the yard, pretending I’m a superhero. I climb the tree, jump off the swing, and chase after the neighbor’s cat. I have so much fun, I don’t even think about the phone once.

By the time I come back inside, it’s almost lunchtime. I’m tired but happy, so I sit down on the couch and turn on the TV. My feet are sore, but it’s a good kind of sore.

Later, Mommy is sitting at the table again, looking at her phone.

“Mommy,” I say, “can I borrow your old phone again? I wanna play.”

She looks up and nods. “Sure,” she says, handing me the phone.

I run back to my room, happy to play again.

When I open the phone, the screen lights up, and I see the same numbers from yesterday. But then I see something I didn’t expect.

There’s a red circle in the corner. A missed call.

I tap it and feel my stomach turn. It’s from the same number. The one I called yesterday.

My hands start to shake. I don’t understand. The phone doesn’t have signal. How could it call me?

I feel cold. My heart starts to beat faster.

I stare at the phone, not sure what to do. And then, the phone rings.

I jump. The same number.

My fingers are stuck, and I can’t move. The ringing is loud in my ears, and I’m too scared to pick it up.

Then the ringing stops. I feel the phone buzz in my hand.

I stare at the phone, my heart pounding in my chest. The ringing stops, and I take a deep breath. My hand is shaking, but I press the green button to answer the call.

The phone crackles, and I can barely hear anything for a second. Then, suddenly, I hear something.

""THEY FOUND ME""

It’s my voice... but it’s not me…

What We Know About Rosé 's Album So Far?


","


Rosé has released only one song so far, titled APT. According to Genius, the other tracks in the album are:

1.Too Bad for Us

2.Game Boy

3.Toxic 'Till the End

4.Two Years

5.Number One Girl

6.3AM

7.Not the Same

8.Dance All Night

9.Drink Some Coffee

10.Vampirehollie

11.APT


APT is the only track officially released, while Rosé has shared snippets or spoilers for Number One Girl, Toxic 'Till the End, 3AM, Two Years, Not the Same, and Vampirehollie. Altogether, we know the names of 11 tracks, but the title of the 12th track remains a mystery.

So far, we’ve heard previews of seven songs, which sound amazing. APT is the eighth confirmed track, but no spoilers have been shared for the remaining four songs. Perhaps Rosé is saving them for a surprise. The snippets we've heard lean heavily into a country music vibe, showcasing a fresh style for her.
    
    On her paper magazine interview there  was a spoiler that her album would be very 'pop' leaning. But after hearing the snippets it isn't the case. Maybe her next single release will be a pop song or it may be a taylor swift style or country music song. What do you guys think about her genere of next single release?.
 
And since she is releasing her album in western artist style, maybe we will also get a deluxe album.

That's the thing that matters. Over the years, we've been molded into consumers. I don't need to get into any of the hairy details as to why and how. Because one long or short look around, gives you all that you need. It's quite evident. The persuasion in commercials. These over sized, god-like billboards, demanding our attention. And the conversations amongst friends or co-workers - ""have you seen the new iphone? - I've got to have it?"" We want it. And we need it, or we think we need it. Not now, but RIGHT NOW!.

>*""All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda system, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and to consume.""* **- Noam Chomsky**

With all this chasing the wind, how can we possibly enjoy the moment? Whether it be simple, quiet, and slowed down. Like the smell of rose petals, or a stroll through the woods, or even some time allowed so that we can come back home (heart, soul, spirit) through meditation. Does it sound like a drag to some of you? But even when the skies light up with fireworks, and the ground shakes from under you. That can still all go unnoticed, because we're distracted. I seen a lady walk into a pole the other day, because she was more concerned about what her phone screen was showing then the sidewalk that she walking on.

How many of you feel as if life is passing you by? ""Where has the time gone?"", you wonder. This seems more and more the case with me the older I've grown? I think a good way to make the most of what we have, while we still have it. Is to allow ourselves permission to slow it down. A little bit of old fashioned R&R - Rest and Relaxation. Which brings me back to my initial comment, and something we've all heard a billion times before ""it's the quality, not quantity that matters."" To slow it down, and engage in the moment, enjoying, and experiencing whatever it is that you're doing at that second. Being mindful, purposeful, and having intent. By default, wouldn't that also help us with cutting some of the fat from our lives? Ridding us of the unnecessary excess?

Instead of 8 cups of coffee a day. One or two, nicely brewed cups, might suffice. When what it took to make that coffee so that you're now able to enjoy it. The farmers involved, in union with Mother Earth, to cultivate, nourish, and help grow that coffee plant. The same coffee plant filling your cup as you sit, stand or get ready for work. Considering all these elaborate aspects, and the labor, and love involved. I'm sure, your next sip, when taking all of these wonderful things into account, will taste so much different. The aroma, nature, climate, spirit, energy, and all of it flavors will come alive, and be noticed. They were always there. It's just that now, you took the time to be mindful of them. And present. Enjoying the moment, and all that has to offer.

Hope you all find your sweet spot, and give it room to breathe and grow.

Before this transfusion my HB was 8.6, after the transfusion (2 bags) its 9.9 which should be good but do i feel any better? No. Probably because my ferritin is at a 2. I'm baffled on how it's that low and the doctor suggested I just take iron pills. 

The smallest, activities drain my energy. Walking the 2 minutes to the bus, walking from my office to the coffee machine. Everything is tiring. I've had to completely stop exercising because im dizzy all the time and short of breath and it's just ✨️annoying✨️

I had a blood transfusion 2 years ago when my HB dipped to a 6 (4 bag transfusion) but my ferritin wasn't as low then.  This us just crazy. 

I visit my main doctor next week, to start iron transfusions.  My anemia comes from heavy periods. We've discussed birth control but I tend to always get bad side effects from any medication so I'm not keen on starting it this late in life (34).

Manufacturers' continuous efforts to upcycle food-produced components have aided in the production of varied beauty products to meet specific skincare requirements.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the upcycled cosmetic ingredients market. The lockdowns and other restrictions led to delays in delivery and surged transportation costs of natural ingredients, posing challenges for the manufacturer conducting business operations.

1grs0e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1grs0e6/a_clockwork_doll/,A Clockwork Doll ,"They march in every morning at eight, all of them--faces slack, eyes glazed, like they’ve left whatever soul they had back at the bus stop. Each step is mechanical, like they’ve been wound-up tight and pointed at their little cubicles. It used to bother me. Now I think it’s funny. Like watching dolls put on a play. Only no one’s laughing.

Today, I’m in early, staring at my screen, pretending I don’t notice the parade of grey suits shuffling by. Paul from accounting, Brenda from HR--they all have their roles. I watch them settle in, get to work, as if any of this matters.

The thing is, I’m starting to wonder if it’s just me who sees it. This…*rot*. This emptiness. Some days it feels like the air itself is stale, like it’s tainted with all the things they’re too scared to say. And lately, I’ve been thinking…*Why hold it in?...Why pretend?* They already treat me like I’m some strange artifact in their precious little machine.

“Morning, Dave!” Brenda’s voice breaks my thoughts. She stands there, beaming at me like I’m some poor kid she’s trying to cheer-up. It makes my skin crawl.

I give her a curt nod. “Brenda.” No need to waste words.

“You’re awfully quiet these days,” she chirps, as if it’s her job to pry open every little box I keep locked up. She stands there, tilting her head like a parrot, a look of mock concern plastered on her face. I wonder if she’d still care if she knew what I was thinking.

“Yeah, well,” I shrug, “not much to say.”

She laughs, this grating sound that hangs in the air. “We should grab a coffee sometime, chat about whatever’s going on. You know, it’s important to keep a positive outlook!” Her eyes shine with that artificial brightness that only comes from people who’ve never faced anything real.

“Right. Positive.” I flash a smile that I’m sure looks as dead as I feel, and she nods, satisfied, before flouncing off.

Positive outlook. I wonder if that’s what she’d call it if she knew what was brewing inside. If she knew about the dreams—the ones where the office is empty and I’m the only one left, flipping desks and tearing down these sterile, white walls. Or the ones where I’m the one with the power, where they all sit at their desks, chained in place, eyes wide, finally understanding what it’s like to be me.

I shake it off, like a dog.

I stand up. My hands are steady as I pull the small black case from under my desk. Inside, it’s simple: a timer, a few wires, and a small, unassuming device. It’s clean, efficient—everything it needs to be. No one will suspect a thing.

The clock on the wall ticks along, matching the beat in my chest. I adjust the timer to 8:15 AM. Everyone will be at their desks by then. 

Soon, all the dolls will stop moving...And I will finally be free.

1grrzul,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1grrzul/reflecting_on_whether_i_handled_the_relationship/,Reflecting on whether I handled the relationship the right way?,"I'm danish so my writing isn't that good. I'm feeling a bit down, and I really feel the need to share. I don’t really feel like sharing it with anyone in real life. It’s about heartbreak.

I moved to a bigger city in the summer of 2023 in Denmark for my master’s program. In November 2023, I posted on a Facebook page (related to my study program) a list of textbooks I needed to buy for the semester - a bit cheaper. A guy replied that he was selling one of them, and we agreed that I would pick it up at his place. He invited me in for coffee, which I didn't expect but time passed together, and there was chemistry, even though we only talked about studies, projects, and work that day. He hugged me for a long time when I was leaving. He had just finished his master’s in the summer of 2023 and was currently unemployed. I left after two hours, and before I even got to open the door to my own home, I received a sweet message from him. I think I fell 'in love' that weekend —it felt that way. My thoughts were only centered on him.

It developed into frequent meetings, long text messages from him, and intimacy. After two months, I could feel my emotions growing for him, so I expressed them, hoping to hear his thoughts about me. He told me that he thought I had many many good qualities and enjoyed spending time with me, but he wasn’t in a place to consider 'an exclusive' (serious) relationship. His reason was that he’d come out of a one-year relationship four years ago with a woman who was mentally unstable, making him feel like he couldn’t breathe, and he was still affected by it. He explained that he had only recently started dating again, with me. He also expressed that he wasn’t into the traditional type of relationship as seen in “the West,” calling it based on selfish principles (doing and saying things maintaining the other’s feelings) and talked about something related to Buddhism and its philosophy, with which he identified. He wanted something different, wasn’t ready for commitment, but enjoydet out meetings. I felt a bit disappointed and couldn’t quite agree with that perspective. Still, I enjoyed the time we spent together, where he was always respectful, caring, patient, always available via text, and didn’t like to have his phone out when we were together, focusing only on us.

He was nine years older, had spent 12 years in the army, been deployed a few times, and then travelled alot to USA one and went on to study for five years at university—he was very thoughtful, intelligent, mild and helpful, articulate, and very knowledgeable. He did a lot to help people. I remember little innocent me, who hadn’t experienced nearly as much as he had, was fascinated by him. I learned a lot, including about myself, through being with him. During our time together, he was unemployed, then in the last three months, he got a job in Copenhagen but often came to Aalborg to visit his family, which usually also meant a visit me. He’d visit once or twice a month. I was waiting for an invitation to Copenhagen, but it never came. I didn’t express this due to his earlier comments and the predefined boundaries of our relationship. I chose to enjoy our meetings whenever we saw each other.

I continued the relationship. Although he set the frame of having no serious commitment, there were still elements in our meetings—his manner and way of talking, how he understood me when we discussed deep topics—that I became very attached to. He was in a way respectful during our meetings and on my terms. After another three months (around 5-6 months of ""relationship"" in total), I felt it wasn’t good for me, with thoughts like: he didn’t initiate anything, our meetings were only within four walls (sex). I noticed that in text messages, he was always approachable, often wrote long messages, but in reality, he was a different character, where other things—intimacy—mattered more. He only had time in the evenings, and always had to leave early in the morning. I expressed this, and he explained that despite living and working in Copenhagen (3 hours away) and his family visits here, he still tried to squeeze in a meeting with me, and I could also just invite him out if I needed something different. I apologized.

I felt somewhat trapped, unable to open up and express myself further because he set the frame of a no comminment/relationship, leaving me stuck and unsure of what I could allow myself. I closed myself off more and more. 

I started checking his Facebook and saw that he’d become friends with a woman—a beautiful young Italian/Danish woman in Copenhagen. I never asked about her, because our relationship was what it was: non-exclusive (serious in that way), nothing specific other than evening-to-morning visits, so I didn’t interfere. However, I did ask him if he was seeing anyone else, to which he replied no.

I decided to follow my intuition, which told me that the relationship wasn’t for me—too unstable and leaving me unsettled, though in a way, I did feel a sense of calm when I was with him due to his calming demeanor. I don’t know how else to describe it. He didn’t make any objections, told me again he wasn't ready for anything serious in that way, other than expressing that he would miss my crazy humor, my playful spirit, and caring nature, and the memories he would hold in his heart forever, and he hoped our relationship had meant something to me too. We ended around April 2024.

Today—7 months after the “break-up”—I looked at his Facebook out of curiosity and saw that the woman he became friends with at that time now has photos with him, and he’s clearly connected with her family as well. It seems like the 'serious relationship' he denied having with me…

It hurts a bit… because I don’t understand it. What does she have, that I don't? Did I handle it wrong? i cant figure this out.",1,1731659903.0,love,1,1.0,False

Last 11/11, he showed me items on the black/orange/pink app, asking ""this or that,"" and then ordered those things. Yesterday, an overwhelming number of packages arrived. He asked me to stay and open them one by one. The items included bottled/preserved food (despite knowing my sensitive stomach), and ₱9,000 worth of slimming, glutathione, and collagen products (which made me feel like he thinks I need to lose weight, even though I just gave birth!).

Every time I opened a package, he'd say ""happy birthday."" My birthday is still a few days away. If there's one thing I really want, it's to finish the renovation of our coffee shop (which is delayed due to budget issues, yet he buys unnecessary items like toys for the kids, jewelry, etc.). He also knows I want to visit my hometown to see my cousins and relatives and attend my aunt’s funeral. Alternatively, I'd love to spend my birthday with him and our kids at a mountain resort or create memories together. Not these material things that will only collect dust.

It's been more than a decade, and he still doesn’t understand what I like. Almost every year, I ask for no material things on Mother's Day or my birthday, but it happens every year.

I have made my own CBD and MCT carrier with coconut oil, which I now take with my other supplements. I keep this in my mouth for a minute or so, which means it can be absorbed sublingually, but could also act as an ""oil pull"" for bacteria (if that is really a thing).

1grrwdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1grrwdw/chatgpt_prompt_grammar_a_new_way_to_write_for_ai/,ChatGPT Prompt Grammar: A New Way to Write for AI (and Maybe the Future of Communication),"# After thousands of hours interacting with ChatGPT, I’ve noticed a significant shift in how I write. My style has become more efficient, stripped of redundancy, and almost programmatic. I call this ChatGPT Prompt Grammar—a new approach to writing optimized for AI and fast, high-context communication.

This isn’t traditional “Formal English Grammar.” It’s procedural, precise, and efficient, prioritizing meaning over form. But here’s the kicker: this style isn’t just useful for AI—it’s starting to affect how I communicate with humans too.

# What is ChatGPT Prompt Grammar?

It’s a hybrid of natural language and code-like structure, designed to communicate efficiently with systems like ChatGPT. Here’s what defines it:

1. Efficiency Over Redundancy: Articles, auxiliary verbs, and possessives are optional if meaning is clear.
   * Example: “Need coffee now” (vs. “I need a coffee now”).
2. Context-Dependent Minimalism: Relies on word order and context to fill in gaps.
   * Example: “Paul book on table” = “Paul’s book is on the table.”
3. Hybrid of Declarative and Procedural: It’s like writing instructions or pseudo-code—requires “processing” to reconstruct full meaning.
   * Example: “Fix error user email” (clear, efficient).
4. Manly, Hard Tone: This style feels assertive and authoritative, projecting strength and decisiveness.
   * Example: “See you 7 PM dinner” (efficient, hard tone) vs. “Let’s meet for dinner at 7 PM!” (warmer, softer tone).

# Why This Matters

# 1. AI Optimization:

This style gets better responses from AI. By reducing ambiguity, you make prompts more precise and results faster.

* Compare:
   * “Write poem sunrise beauty” (efficient, clear).
   * “Could you write a poem about the beauty of the sunrise, please?” (longer, less direct).

# 2. Future of Human Communication:

Here’s the surprising part: this style could influence how humans communicate.

* It’s hard, manly, and procedural, making it feel confident and authoritative.
* Social Media: Works for sharp, high-IQ readers and AI audiences alike but may feel “alien” or cold to others.
* Workplace: Sharpens professional communication (e.g., “Need report EOD” vs. “Could you please send the report by end of day?”).
* Personal Life: Risks sounding abrupt unless softened for emotional contexts.

# 3. A New Global English?

With millions interacting with AI daily, this style could influence how English evolves. Simplified grammar might become more standard, blending “Formal English” with “Real Global English” driven by efficiency.

# Examples of ChatGPT Prompt Grammar

1. Commands:
   * ChatGPT Prompt Grammar: “Fix email error.”
   * Formal English Grammar: “Could you please fix the error in the user’s email?”
2. Lists:
   * ChatGPT Prompt Grammar: “Top 5 AI tools. Generate summary.”
   * Formal English Grammar: “Please generate a summary of the top five AI tools.”
3. Information Requests:
   * ChatGPT Prompt Grammar: “What’s latest AI news?”
   * Formal English Grammar: “Can you tell me the latest news about AI?”

# How to Use ChatGPT Prompt Grammar

1. Simplify: Focus on core meaning. Drop redundant words like “the,” “a,” “please” when they add no value.
2. Structure Like Code: Use logical, procedural phrasing: “Create list: top 5 movies.”
3. Audience Awareness: For humans, soften the tone or add redundancy when needed. For AI or sharp readers, lean fully into efficiency.

# Why It’s Relevant for Reddit Users

Whether you’re writing ChatGPT prompts, social media posts, or workplace emails, adopting ChatGPT Prompt Grammar can make your communication more effective and impactful. It also feels like a power move, projecting confidence and decisiveness.

# What Do You Think?

This happened some years ago. i was 24 and he was 40. Now I am 29 and haven't seen him in years. I wasn't coworker with her back then. They were and are a wealthy family who lived in a nice neighbourhood meant for those with money. I worked there at a bakery/ coffee shop and he was a regular customer. I felt a strong attraction to him since day one but he never acted interested for weeks. Didn't give off cheater vibes, he had his wedding bend on and often came with his teen daughter.

But we ended hooking up after almost 2 months. our affair lasted for a few months. But I realised what a trash human being I am and one day I just found another job in another part of the city. He had my number and texted me to see where I am but when I said that I found another job he was like, oh fine, good luck.

Now, my life and situation is much better. I work in a big company and my pay is more than decent. And his daughter joined our department (At least not my team!) as a student. First I just suspected it is her, but then I saw her name and it was clear. She is really nice and modest (not like him) and she also remembered me from the bakery (she was 14 back then). 

And two days ago it happened. The rain was pouring and he came to pick her up from the office. I thought she is waiting for an Uber, so i waited with her. And then I saw his Mercedes and I thought I will throw up. She asked if I am sure I don't want to go with them (fortunately I also ordered an uber,s o I had a good excuse to say no). He saw me and I believe he recognised me because after getting into the car she told me through the window that her dad is also asking if I want to join. Yesterday at the office she confirmed that her father also recognised me.

Buckfast Tonic Wine (No Vintage)

Screw cap, took it off about 30 minutes before to bring in some air. Apparently made by monks in England. Decided to try while cooking dinner. Poured into a glass, first glance has a very inky almost brownish color that you see in older wines. Very syrupy, liquid clings to the side of the glass when swirled. Almost 15% ABV.

Stuck my nose in and was hit with something I've never experienced before. Barnyardy funk (in a bad way) almost like a dead animal in a bird's nest. A mix of flat Coca Cola and caramel with a whiff of gun metal.

On the palate, overwhelming sweetness and sugar. Cherry Cola mixed with Benadryl. Unlike anything I've tasted. I'm not sure what this liquid is but it is not wine, I'm actually not sure what it is but it tastes like something a doctor would prescribe. A chemical concoction of the highest degree. Can only compare it to a Four Loko.

Managed to make it through a couple small glasses but not much more. Has absolutely ruined the evening drinking-wise for me as I tried to drink a nice Bordeaux after but the iron-like metallic sweet aftertaste I just couldn't get out of my mouth even after a few glasses of water. I don't drink a lot of coffee regularly so I also have mild heart palpitations from the caffeine after just drinking a bit of this and feel a slight migraine.

An ungodly concoction made by seemingly godly men. I believe the Vatican needs to send an exorcist over to Buckfast Abbey as the devil's works are cleary present there. After tasting this ""wine,"" the way I feel can only be described as akin to being under a bridge on one's knees orally pleasing a vagrant while simultaneously drinking liquified meth through a dirty rag.
