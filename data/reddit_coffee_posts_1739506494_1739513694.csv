Different countries have different cultures but humans tend to have similar personalities across the globe. Depending on your personality and stage of life, you might have different priorities and prefer one aspect more than another. 

What do I mean by that, let's give an example:

If you enjoy being outdoors, long nights and interact with people, the Mediterranean lifestyle fits you better than countries that simply don't have the climate or people who easily engage with each other. 

You want to thrive financially and chase the big money? There are other countries/cities where you are better off than in the Mediterranean.

1ip46xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/vitanam_initiative/comments/1ip46xj/the_food_chain_sentience_and_sapience/,"The Food Chain, Sentience and Sapience","**Preface**: Another one of the topics I catch myself responding to frequently, but never getting it on paper in any satisfactory way. Well. Yesterday, this happened. There are some bits that require some work, but all in all, it stands pretty well.

**TL;DR:** For animals, it's not about sentience. It's about having no concept of tomorrow. I've got no trouble with killing something (non-human) that doesn't have dreams. We call it sapience. So far, no other animal has ever been self-involved enough to bother with that stuff.

**Morning Coffee Version**

No animal thinks about tomorrow. So only today counts. Make today great. And no, this can't be translated to humans. That's a strawman. It's about animals. Not brain-dead humans, or humans with magical memory loss, or humans with dementia, or anything.

We handle humans special, and we always have. *We'll protect a mass-murdering, psychopathic teenager, no problem. It's a self-defense mechanism. People need to know that they don't have to fear tomorrow, so they will not fight today. That's ethics. To keep the peace. Animals evidently don't have that.* But we need to do that. We'd kill each other left and right, otherwise.

My trouble is with living conditions. Just as raising a child in a box is illegal, so should raising animals in unnatural conditions be. Sentience is important there. It's also better for general biology; living in pain isn't exactly conducive to health. Feeding animals a species-inappropriate diet needs to be illegal, too. Being permanently pregnant also usually isn't viable, unless they are a Tribble.

Just like us, animals thrive on what they have evolved to: food, environment, and so on. No surprise there, I hope.

And that's not grains, ground-up carcasses, and antibiotics paired with growth hormones. Humans can choose what they want to eat, so that's fine. But diabetic cows and pigs are not natural. And the resulting meat isn't right either. They don't have a choice.

It's a food chain thing. When we get to an area with few accessible resources, we would find an animal specialized in that resource, and eat the animal. We can't eat grass, so we eat a grass-eating animal. Cows can't eat dirt, so they eat things that grow in it. And so on. That is perfectly natural, and it's the way everything has evolved.

Human-centric thinking is arrogant and dangerous, since we don't understand most of the universe. People run around shouting ""healthy"" and ""fitness,"" and don't have a single clue what that means at a species level. Many seem happy with the shoddy evidence. I'm not.

Besides, the human-harvesting aliens might already be on their way.

The real enemy is factory-farmed products, for now, and those aliens. That shit is hurting people and animals in ways most people don't comprehend, or can't even guess at. Stop it with the aliens...

And to be honest, *I'm pro-vegan*. That's not a joke. Not for ethical reasons. I don't feel like placing the fate of the species on emotion-based ideas.

I am absolutely pro-vegan. I'm actually donating money to research focused on making artificial food. It's not important now; it will be when we get to 20 billion people or more. Real vegan meat, with **everything** that meat has, not just the few components that we deem important. But we are too far away from even trying to roll that out in a big way. I don't trust the entire approach and all the marketing involved. Practical science is on holiday and has been replaced by flashy, niche science.

We've witnessed science go blind too many times. We threw out RNA as useless for science for decades. Called it junk. Just one example. That didn't keep us from proclaiming that we know how DNA works; Now we know how nutrition works? We don't. Microbiome? Fiber? Red Meat? There is absolutely no consensus. Well, nephrologists and endocrinologists have some clues, but few people listen to them. Because they don't have a narrative to sell, they don't care about ethics or morals; they just see biology‚Äîand that's too simplistic a view of humans. You can't really fight biology. We need to invent abstraction layers to squabble over.

Because we love to fight.

We are not capable of determining if the artificial food we make is good for us. Many metabolic conditions take decades, and sometimes generations, to appear. The required tests are not in any healthcare plan. I don't share the short-term enthusiasm; I'm for a long-term plan with actual goals to reach and quality markers for control. We've got none of that. 

*First step:* No animal may be fed species-inappropriate food. A ruminant animal needs a pasture, pigs need to forage, and chickens should do what chickens do. 98% of all suffering done away with! Just the killing part is left. For a while, that's a workable compromise, with steady improvement of the situation. The pressure comes from us alone. The animals won't mind when their living conditions are great. Because they don't know, and they won't fear. They would just be.

Stuff like dairy is not appropriate on a large scale. Meat, though, no loss in quality of life. Just duration. And what's the concept of duration for creatures that don't know about tomorrow and have no sense of accomplishment? No Sapience? Exactly. Nothing.

Only humans care about that. Because we do think about tomorrow. It matters to us. It doesn't matter to other animals. Try to really understand what that means. It is highly significant. It is a real thing. The whole concept of slavery doesn't fly either. Fresh start every day. It should not be our concern, and most of all, no reason to pick a fight with other humans. Always ready to fight.

Make it a great day for the animals. That's enough work for decades, and it can be done by vegans and omnis, together. In Unison. For the animals. Which would suffer a lot less. And the nature that we create that way will be truly epic and productive. Because that's what nature is.

We started off as friends, and later he pursued me romantically, to which I agreed after a couple of months. We've been intimate as well a couple of times. 

Once i actually said yes, he became distant. Stopped initiating conversations (tbh he was going through a rough patch at work). So our communication has reduced over phone, since we were unable to meet personally(I agree that he is fully present when we met directly ). Didn't help that he's always surrounded by friends. 

Now he's shifting cities due to a new job, and he left for the new city without telling me. He did tell me about the new job and that he will leave soon, but I expected a good bye properly, you know? I asked him for a lunch, coffee, dinner, something, but he told me he's busy with the shifting and all. One day he agreed and then he later came and said he forgot about the lunch. (Yeah, stood me up) He did assure me that he will be always available over phone, but he seemed very overwhelmed last week, and so i didn't want to impose, hence, I've decided I'll not initiate contact until he contacts me. 

It's valentine's day today, and he has not wished me yet.  Has he ghosted me? Isn't this disrespectful? 

I am an anxiously attached person also, who already had a lot of relationship trauma. I am a mess today. 

Someone please tell me if this is normal in any twisted way of yours.  Or is this some twisted way of leaving without a good bye? Or is he ghosting me? 

Edit: He knows about how I am in separation process and all the relationship trauma. I don't see the point in chasing me, making a mess out of it and leaving unceremoniously like this. ",2,1739513193.0,ENFP,2,1.0,False

I was where everyone said i belonged, a good job, a house and friends...

But i just knew something wasnt right, as if i was lost, but yet ... i knew where i was.

Wake up, go to work, come home.

Wake up, go to work, come home.

I havent lived a good life... gangs, drugs, jouvies and prisons... i thought i was finally doing good? ... 

Is this it? The ""good"" life everyone says we have to live?...

I became numb to the repetitions and found myself drinking myself to sleep, believing that was the medecine i needed to keep on living.

After a while i could feel this thing, it was like a pressure in my gut as if it was telling me i was in danger and i cant be here....

I woke up one morning, turned off my alarm and i sat there... 
My body wouldnt get me up and ready, even if i tried... 

The gut feeling was so strong it was if it was an over blown balloon about to POP!!

I decided to follow this gut feeling and it led me to packing a bag, all i can hear in my head was ""west"" .... 

So i left the house keys on the counter, grabbed my bag, then i started walking....

35 days i walked the prairies and through the rocky mountains, witnessing the beauty of life most dont ever get to see feel and even taste!... i was living in it!

For the first time in a long time i learned to love myself, forgive myself and those who have done me wrong... as i searched and learned the wild and land, i was able to search and learn the wild lands inside of my head.... i learned things i never knew about me... 

The wild life i have experienced was outstanding, now i have been an avid hiker and camper growing up... but now i was really in it! Sleeping in meadows and on mountain sides under a tarp... 

Even woke up to a grizzly sniffing my head one morning,  let me tell you it was better than a morning coffee!! 

I went through snow, rain storms, freezing nights and even the deathly heat of summer... through all the pain and suffering, i have never felt more alive...

I felt something...

I felt as if i belonged and became one with the wild... 

Ever since, i became a vagabond, a leather tramp. 

I became....

Text","(Posted this on the main Askgaybros sub but I figured I should post it here too because I still have no idea what to do and it is a very over 30 years old question)

Previously I posted on here about having my first ever date last month. After nearly full year of almost daily texting and lot of worry and anxiety leading up to the meet up it actually turned out pretty great. What was a simple coffee chat turned into a 4 and a half hour talk about our lives, hobbies and special interests. While I thought I spilled to much spaghetti following it I was genuinely shocked that he sent me a text afterwards wanting to meet up again. Two weeks later we ended up going on a dinner and drinks date that also turned into a four hour chat that went very well. While there was no kissing/hand holding or any sort of PDA during either (I never got any signals that was an option because I'm an idiot and or Autistic) they both went about as good as I thought they could go and I definitely felt that there was a bit of a spark between us. Last week I took the initiative to ask him out for an other date and after five days on read (he's an historically bad texter) he sent back an text saying that while I was ""a Super cool badass dude"" he wanted to continue going out but only as friends. It genuinely felt like a knife in the gut. I know that it was probably a bad move on my part brought on my shock and the crushing weight of rejection but I fired back a text asking a yes or no question on if he was attracted to me (because, and let's be honest, I'm kind of lacking in the face/body/personality/neurotypicalness/socio economical/ geographicational departments) just for a clear and honest answer but only got back a refused to answer honestly ""I'm not interested romantically but I am interested platonically"" text. I haven't responded back to him yet because I'm not sure where to take it from here. 

So here's my actual question: Do I just call it a loss and move on or do I go the just friends route? 

My knee jerk reaction was to give into the whole ""boys are terrible and everything sucks forever"" thing and block him immediately while I gave into the very real possibility that I'm going to be a forever alone cave troll because hey it's been 10 years on the gay apps and the one real date I had with an actual guy that I was starting to have real feelings for rebuffed me after the second meet up but, after a few days to think about it, a lot of dark thoughts, and bunch of openly crying (again, literally all of these emotions are new to me at 32 years old) I'm starting to think that platonic might be the way to go?

On one hand he knows all about my many quirks and has so far been very accepting of them, the repport is really good and it would be nice to have an actual IRL gay guy friend because I really have none and I know once you're over 30 friendships are almost impossible to form (even if you're a straight person) but on the other hand going that route sounds like the most pathetic ""cucked"" thing imaginable and I don't know if I could still interact with him knowing that I whiffed it that bad and being constantly aware that I was stuck permanently in the friend zone. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.

TL;DR Went on 2 dates, thought they went great, got hit with the ""just friends?"" text. Not sure if I should give in and go that route or just block him and keep holding out for something more from someone else ",5,1739512676.0,AskGaybrosOver30,3,1.0,False

Hugo blinked, the swirling images from the screens still dancing in his mind as he wandered back into the hallway. Little Mer had vanished a little while ago, though not before they played a long round of 'Concentration 64.' She'd also beat him in several sock sliding races.

The same mismatched carpet stretched long down the hallway before him, a bizarre patchwork of shag, crochet, and tapestry that shifted with every other step. The doors, however, were all identical, their brass knobs gleaming in the warm reflection of the dimly lit mahogany corridor.

Hugo wished Mer was still here. It was unnerving standing here alone, feeling like the corridor was holding its breath. But curiosity always won over the son of Pandia. He couldn't resist wrenching open one of the doors, to the left of the one he had just come from.

A sudden burst of heat washed over Hugo. He was staring up at the looming lava climbing wall from camp, a dangerous molten stream trickling down its side. Troy Mohagesh stood at its base, staring up at the deadly goo with his hands on his hips. The sight sent a pang of homesickness through Hugo, but he closed the door fast.

""No thank you,"" he chuckled to himself. Hugo and Troy had lost way too much hair to that thing, and this dream didn't need to tread into nightmare territory.

He yanked another door open, stepping into a perfectly tidy living room.

Moonlight filtered through the sheer white curtains, brightening the dull, beige couch and the glass coffee table at the room's center. It cast shadows on the pristinely bare walls. Aunt Lusia's impeccably tidy space back home in Miami.

Hugo smiled as he closed this door, too. It was not the same without his hyperactive cousins causing mayhem in there, so he would have to come back another time.

Another door opened into the dense woods of rural Pennsylvania. It was good to feel the cool, damp earth beneath his feet. But last time Hugo had been here, a strix tried to paralyze him and his friends. So maybe he wouldn't stay here, either.

The son of Pandia sighed and tried another door. It wouldn't budge. Frowning, he pulled harder, planting a foot on the doorframe for leverage. It didn‚Äôt even creak.

""It won't *ooopen*,"" a girlish sing-song voice suddenly said behind him.

Hugo yelped and spun around, stumbling backward and nearly smacking the back of his head. A girl about his age had suddenly appeared in the corridor, studying him with a mixture of amusement and patience through her comically large glasses. The thick clay tablet in her hands in vibrated with a faint hum before emitting a cheerful ping. She ignored it.

Hugo straightened under her gaze, clearing his throat awkwardly as he regained his composure. ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ Who are you?‚Äù

The girl arched an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know yet?‚Äù She tilted her head, a few unruly strands of wavy hair coming loose from her bun. ""Well, that's alright. We all have our strengths and weaknesses."" Hugo only blinked.

The goddess sighed. Pandia would have never warned that her son wasn't very bright. Yet somehow, the Muse wasn't very surprised‚Ä¶

‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt have time for the whole ‚Äòcryptic messenger‚Äô act,‚Äù she said, holding up her tablet and pointing at a glowing swirl on its upper right corner. ‚ÄúThat place,"" she drew a finger to the door behind Hugo, ""is what was going to be. That‚Äôs why the door won‚Äôt open. You haven‚Äôt seen it yet.‚Äù

""Oh,"" Hugo frowned, turning to look at the door again. ""Will I ever see it?""

The girl bit her lip, glancing down at her tablet. ""Er, you could. Hypothetically."" She looked up at him again, her magnified gray eyes sparkling with sudden sympathy. ""I usually can't say until you make it happen, but‚Ä¶"" she turned her attention back to her tablet with a frown. ""The odds aren't looking too great at the moment.""

""Wait, what do you mean?"" Hugo's asked, his heart suddenly beating faster. Bad odds sounded, well‚Ä¶ bad.

""Gah! Shouldn't have said anything,"" the girl tapped at her forehead a few times. ""Listen, Hugo. I just meant to do a quick little check-in, see how you were doing. I'm afraid I have to go."" Her tablet pinged again. ""Just‚Ä¶ Feel free to make yourself at home here. Or don't, and try to escape. It's up to you,"" she added quickly.

Before Hugo could say another word, the girl's form began to shimmer. All he could do was avert his eyes as she vanished into an explosion of swirling blue and yellow dust.

\-

It was unnerving, being here alone. But Hugo had to admit, it stirred a sort of thrilling curiosity within. He might as well do some more exploring, see what other friends and places were behind these doors. Figuring out how to return to whatever was going on in the actual world sounded like a later problem. 

As he walked, the hallway itself seemed to stretch and shift, the doors growing farther apart or closer together at random intervals. 

Was Hugo still dreaming? It was feeling like it less and less. But this place couldn't be real, alive like this. 

Was it some kind of trap? It did have a somewhat benevolent being in charge. Even though she had floated the idea of 'escape,' Hugo didn't feel like he was in a particular rush to leave.

He stopped in front of another door, hesitating for a moment before gripping the brass knob. He twisted it slowly, half-expecting it to resist like the last one. But this one gave way easily, swinging open to reveal a bustling city street. The unmistakable vibrancy of a Bogot√° street market suddenly burst into the dimly lit hallway, the sound of music and chatter bouncing off the walls. The familiar scent of frying cheese...

Now this Hugo could get behind! At least for a little while. With a warm sigh, he stepped into the market, grinning at the strangers behind the stalls and making small talk in Spanish. He left the door open behind him, making sure that he could find his way back when he was done. 

Back in the hallway, a soft but steady voice started to call Hugo's name. [It was Mer's](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hjcgcb/comment/m71n6nj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).",2,1739512534.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

I am struggling, a lot. I have had a WILD time growing up, and to be short, yeah..Im fucked up in the head. Diagnosed with MDD, PMDD, ADD and Anxiety meds are up to 150mgs. Ive been in therapy for the past almost two years and my progress is honestly baffling. Weighed 106 5‚Äô5 at 18 with almost no appetite due to being very depressedüôÉ I am now comfortably 136 5‚Äô5 and have a healthy relationship with food now. I however do not have a healthy relationship with myself. My parents have truly never understood me, I struggled in school due to undiagnosed add, diagnosed in 3rd grade with dyslexia and auditory processing disorder. 504 plan and nothing past that. My parents dont necessary believe in mental health, therfore I was never in any extra programs, therapy or counseling. School was hell. I would go home and get degraded and yelled at, then grounded for a while (months). I remember being told in 5th grade that if I needed to go to summer school that ‚ÄúI would be a disgrace.‚Äù Things like that, and I can tell you honestly at the time I didnt even know what the fuck summer school was. I remember my dad ripping tests and papers up when I was in 2nd grade due to a paper having a D on it. Basically im trying to get you to understand I had zero support from a YOUNG age. In or our of school. I have wild stories about things that happened at school.  But I hit rock bottom my senior year of high school. I had an altercation with a teacher, (she ended up apologizing) but she was pissed at me because i did not lock my phone up one day telling my dad ‚ÄúI laughed and berated her‚Äù Resulting in him calling me a ‚Äúselfish stupid bitch.‚Äù Yeah, to say the least I was BEAT and DRAINED. Didnt know what to do with myself and found myself trying to take my life one night. Didn‚Äôt succeed and went to school the next day. I ended up in the councilors office (not telling her the previous events occurring the night before) either way she called my mom telling her to put me in therapy. My mom called me at school later that day telling me to cut my shit and stop acting like I have something wrong with me because I do not have anxiety. I ended up hating my parents by the age of 18. Cleared my savings account with new clothes that I was never allowed to buy (American eagle jeans, pacsun, aerie) I also took myself to clubs and bars at the age of 18 and would come home a mess and got my hair and nails done. I truly can say I was spiraling incredibly fast. My parents were to a point where they couldn‚Äôt say anything to me without me shutting it down immediately, not trying to involve them in my life any longer,  they caught on and basically started to victimize themselves saying how could I hate such amazing parents who have given me so much and everything I ask for‚Ä¶I shut down immediately and This resulted in the first time being kicked out of my home. 

I want to add this here and tell you this is when i ended a state of psychosis and was playing a game of survival in my head trying to figure out how to be okay and what I was going to do. At this point I had really registered the fact that my parents didnt gibe a shit about me. My mom was mad at my brother too for some reason i cant remember of, and she an hour after kicking me out told me to bring him back, my dad then texted ME telling me to come back. I brought my brother back (he has a health condition and genuinely wouldn‚Äôt make it if he didnt have his supplies) i hadn‚Äôt spoken to my parents in a week. I remember exactly 7 days after this I went downstairs to ask my parents to why they didnt like me. (Stupid on my end) I was called lazy and my mom had made a comment along the lines of ‚Äúthis is exactly why your father was the one who told you to stay here, not me‚Ä¶? You think I wanted you to come back?‚Äù I was at rock bottom after this and my ED had started. Fast forward 6 months and my relationship with my parents is literally non existent. My mom had upgraded her phone and she was giving me her old phone, I was transferring over my data and erasing hers, she has an ipad. She was downstairs on her ipad. I was transferring data and her instagram went off, long story short I caught her cheating (3rd time) but this time it was with her best friends husband. My mom only had one friend. And that friend was her. We had been on vacations with them, they have slept at out house, met all our family. She was on the ipad and what was going on. Called me downstairs and started screaming, I mean genuinely top of the lung screaming about me ignoring an email? I genuinely to this day have no idea what she was even trying to say but I didnt get one word out when she then again Kicked me out of the house. This time i was tired, I was drained, defeated and depressed I packed my entire room in two hampers and a Pillow case and blanket. I nearly crashed my car this day because I was so out of my right mind. I ended up having a bad panic attack, throwing up and sick at that point. My parents tried calling me the next morning and I did not answer. I didnt go home for 3 days and shut my location off to scare them and it worked honestly but it didnt even matter at that point. I told them the only way i was going home is if we met in public for a discussion. My dad fortunately was not there and I read my mom to complete filth. I made her cry. I sent her home from that coffee shop crying. And I happily packed my bags to go home. (I felt so selfish and sad but so excited to see my dogs‚òπÔ∏è) I have not told my dad about my mom‚Äôs infidelity but fortunately his wife did find out. And it was messy. My mom covering the whole thing making it look like it was business related, my dad still doesnt have a clue. Anyway ive been in therapy for two years now and am doing better, dont get me wrong i have a lot of work to do but i am no longer being verbally abused, my stuff stopped getting broken around 8th grade, but I am lost. I am so exhausted and dont know how to get out of this house or where to start. I am so sorry if you read this whole thing and if you did I appreciate you so much and admire your patience.

1ip3tr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GalaxiGazer/comments/1ip3tr4/this_is_the_present_a_lesson_in_dating_sponsored/,"""This is the present"": A lesson in dating sponsored in part by Smallville","I wanted to save this for the a.m., but I sense the importance of getting this out before I go to sleep. 

While it remains to be seen as to whether or not that HVAC guy will text me back, the whole experience is a welcome reminder that I'm officially in dating territory after spending the majority of my adult life either as a wife or in pursuit of being one. I'm beginning to feel like I'm 18 again, being free to meet different guys, seeing what's out there, seeing what I like. The only real difference is, now at 40, there's no pressure for the right relationship to happen. 

This recalls to my memory an episode from *Smallville* (which was all the rage on the WB channel, along with *Gilmore Girls*, *Everwood*, and *7th Heaven*). In one episode, Clark Kent (Tom Welling) was cursed with a superpower that would make his eyes into fire each time he was lusting after a woman. This produced some kind of effect on women around him, as they'd get all seductive, charming, amorous, flirtatious, and very thirsty. This aroused the jealousy of Lois Lane (Erica Durance) and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). In one scene, Lana and Lois were making it very clear to Clark that they both wanted him. He enjoyed the attention and the ego boost from it all. After Lana hit on him, Lois aggressively grabbed him by his jacket and said, ""*She's your past.* ***I'm*** *your future*."" He shoved her off him and, with a smirk, told her, ""*This is the present*.""

That's what I want to focus on. 

Speaking for myself, I've learned that one of the advantages of being single is having the freedom to confront the ghosts from my past so that I'm not being hung up on any of them. I've accepted that the wrong ones were not available, incompatible, ghosters, creepers, users, losers, and abusers. There is still one guy remaining on my mind who might possibly be in my future. 

But just as Clark had said, ""*This is the present*.""

*In the* *present*, I'm available to freely communicate to guys my interest.

*In the* *present*, selecting the right (kind of guy) means going through a series of texting and going out on first dates. 

*In the present*, a text is a text. A phone call is a phone call. Going out to dinner is going out to dinner. Meeting for coffee or lunch is simply ... meeting for coffee or lunch. 

*In the present*, this guy is a perfect stranger, with whom I'm slowly getting to know over time. 

*In the present*, I'm getting to know if this guy uses an Apple or Android, where he got his college degree, if he's ever climbed Mount Everest, or if he's afraid of heights. 

One of my many mistakes that I've made while I was in a relationship was that I could never keep my head in the game in the present moment. I would either be wrapped up about someone from the past (and projecting any or all unresolved issues with an innocent party) or I'd be light years ahead, thinking about what it would be like for us to say ""I love you"" for the first time or how he would propose. It was never in the present moment, focusing on important things like if he's willing to take the time to talk with me on the phone or how well we can integrate each other into our own individual lives. Being too focused on the past puts the guy in an unfair position, holding him responsible for the mistakes of others and putting the pressure on him to somehow prove that he's different. Being too overly focused on the future stifles the relationship from organically growing into something successful or I miss obvious red flags. 

The present moment is what matters. 

*In the present*, yes, I can freely communicate to guys my interest. I'm not using them to get over someone (past) and I'm not making any declarations of love or commitment (future). 

*In the present*, selecting the right (kind of) guy means going through a series of texting and first dates. The wrong ones won't make it past this probationary period and will be forgotten at some point. The right guy will graduate from texting to calling and will have no problem not only setting up a second date but showing up for it as well. 

*In the present*, texting, phone calls, dinner, and meeting for coffee or lunch is simply just that. I'm not recreating a memory as I pine for someone else (past) or envisioning him waiting for me at the end of the aisle (future). We are just talking. 

*In the present*, I'm getting to know the basic things about this man. I'm not looking for someone else in his eyes (past) and I'm not seeing him as a future husband (future). He's someone I recently met and getting to know. 

Another side to this (and I know I'm aging myself here), is that I clearly remember what dating was like before the dominance of social media and dating online. There was no sense of pressure over texting, because cell phones were not that widely used; the phone number given out was to a landline. If he wanted to call, he would dial the number and leave a message on my answering machine. There were minimal online dating sites, even when there were opportunities to meet people in real life. Back then, the next logical step after meeting someone of interest would be either a phone call or meeting up for a date. Online dating sites encouraged meeting up with the other person. Emailing only lasted so long. There were no chat apps, DMs, or social media following. It was more obvious as to whether or not someone was or wasn't interested. Things were taken more slowly; it was normal not to hear back from someone after a day or two. Scheduling dates were not immediate. It was important to communicate and connect first before seeing them. 

I'm starting to revisit that now. When it's the right time and the right person, there is no pressure and no need to rush. I want to enjoy taking my time with meeting guys, learning the proper way of communicating with them, and seeing how things go through the natural course of time.

1ip3tbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/tapesoftrepidation/comments/1ip3tbr/sanguis_pt_1/,Sanguis [Pt. 1],"‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something out there,‚Äù Deputy Erikson said.

The child came running out of the woods directly in front of my jeep. I slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle screeched to a halt about three feet away from him, headlight beams reflecting in his eyes.

Beside me, Deputy Erikson almost dropped a cup of coffee in his lap. Meanwhile, I was frozen in place, my fingers clutching the steering wheel for dear life, knuckles bulging against the skin.

""Is that the kid?"" Erikson asked.

Exhaling the tension from my body, I said: ""That's a kid, alright, but not the one we're looking for.""

I unfastened my seat belt and climbed out of the car. Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, I walked towards the child with my hands raised in plain sight.

We were scouring the area for a missing girl. About six years old, auburn red hair, freckled face. Alys was her name. She‚Äôd been taken from a parking lot after one of her treatments. No one knew how.

The child in front of us, though, was a little boy, maybe eight to ten years old. Short, bedraggled brown hair, tan, and skinny as a beanpole.

There were leaves and twigs sticking out of the nest of his hair. Mud stained his bare feet. Small pink scratches adorned his arms and legs. For late October, the weather was too cold and windy to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt. But if I had to guess, the temperature was the least of his concerns.

""Calm down now, son,"" I told him, ""we're not gonna hurt you.""

I could see it in his eyes. The teetering scales that resided within every person. That intrinsic response to perceived danger. Fight or flight? Stay or go?

The boy looked primed to run, but we were out in the middle of nowhere, standing on an endless stretch of asphalt. Last farm was about seven miles back, the next farm was probably another good seven miles ahead.

""Can you tell me your name?"" I asked. ""I'm Deputy Solanis with Halleran County Sheriff's Department. You can call me Raymond if you'd like, or Ray if that's easier.""

The boy stared at me with wide eyes. His pupils were dilated, eclipsing the whites. He parted his cracked lips and whispered: ""Thomas.""

""Thomas, that's a nice name. Can you tell me what you're doing out here, Thomas?""

The boy trembled with fear, wildly thrashing his head from side-to-side. ""Please! Please! Please! Don't send me back...I can't go back...don't make me."" He fell to his knees and sobbed. ""Hollow...men...bad...animals...in the trees...""

His head snapped up in my direction. There was a sudden stillness to him that made my heart drop. Like a lull during a thunderstorm, when the entire world goes quiet.

""The Fisherman is real,"" Thomas cried. ""He's in the trees! He'll come for me. They all will!""

Then, without warning, the boy fell flat onto the tarmac, unconscious. I rushed over to him and placed my fingers on his neck. There was a faint pulse present. From what I could discern there were no apparent cuts or broken bones. No indication of internal or external bleeding other than the few small scratches from running through bushes and other foliage.

I picked the boy up and returned to the jeep, setting him in the backseat. Taking my place behind the wheel, I spun the car around and headed towards the nearest hospital. About a twenty or thirty minute drive. But that's the Midwest for you. An archipelago of small towns isolated by an ocean of farms and forests. Rolling fields with a few riverbeds and streams interspersed.

While I drove, my foot heavy on the accelerator, my partner radioed the station with an update. Then, he called the hospital, told them to have a room and staff on standby for our arrival.

He hung the receiver on its cradle and peered into the backseat, a look of anguish upon his face. He muttered a soft prayer and turned in his seat, facing the front again.

""Son of a bitch,"" he muttered, glancing at the clock on the dash. ""I'm 'sposed to go trick-or-treating with Dany in about an hour.""

I checked the time. He was right. It was nearing the end of our shift. Getting anyone to willingly work a Saturday was tough. Convincing them to stay late was almost impossible. Of course, if the sheriff demanded it, there wasn't much they could do. At the same time, the sheriff was away on vacation, leaving me in charge.

""Tell you what,"" I said. ""Help me drop the kid off, and I'll let you get going for the night.""

""Are you sure?"" he asked, but there wasn't much in the way of sincerity. ""I'd hate to leave you high and dry.""

""I'll be fine. Didn't have plans anyway.""

""Oh, right..."" Erikson averted his gaze from me, once more looking back at the boy. ""Think he's from Sanguis?""

""Sanguis?""

""Yeah, closest town I can think of other than Baywater. But Baywater's about an extra twenty minutes from where we found him.""

""How far is Sanguis?""

""About eight minutes if you'd kept on the highway. Small gravel road that'll take you there.""

I nodded, storing the information away at the back of my mind. ""Sanguis, why haven't I heard of it?""

""Doesn't surprise me. Not many people have. They're a tight-knit community. Population can't be more than two thousand, if that. Only reason I know them is for their sweet corn.""

""What about it?""

""Just that it's pretty damn good. All their produce is. Since they're so far out, they have to take it to other markets and whatnot. But a few years back, they ran out of sweetcorn before I could get any. So, I asked the lady selling it for directions and went straight to the source. I'm tellin‚Äô ya, stuff is out of this world. Dany and Lin go crazy over it.""

For the last few years, most of my dinners were plastic-wrapped and bought from a gas station. Couldn't remember the last time I'd gone grocery shopping for anything other than a six-pack and TV dinners. Maybe a frozen pizza if I was really hungry. But those days, my appetite was practically nonexistent.

We arrived at the hospital and carried the kid inside. Despite the holiday weekend, we were met by a number of nurses with a stretcher ready. Before I knew it, the boy was wheeled away, down the hall and around the corner. A doctor approached to question us, but we didn't have as many answers as he would've preferred. To be fair, I wasn't pleased about it either. Should've tried harder to get a full name or something concrete.

""How long do you think he‚Äôll be under?"" I asked the doctor.

""Can't say until I've had a chance to examine him,"" the doctor admitted. ""The collapse could've been a result of extreme fatigue, malnutrition, mental strain, induced narcotics...I should be able to provide a better answer soon.""

My heart was racing, and my patience was burning. I couldn't stand the idea of waiting around, twiddling my thumbs, hoping everything would just land on my lap. Especially since we still had flyers to pass out for the missing girl.

""How 'bout this,"" I said, grabbing a pen and piece of paper from the front desk, ""I'll leave my personal cell and my partner's number. Kid wakes up, you call us. Until then, I'm gonna have a look around, see if I can't find the parents first.""

The doctor took the sheet of paper and nodded. ""Be careful out there tonight, Deputy. Full moon is a bad sign.""

""Well, I'm not one for superstitions, doc.""

We went back to the jeep, and I drove my partner home. His wife and son greeted me with excitable waves. The boy was dressed up as a scarecrow, and the mom in a white and blue dress with a little wicker basket.

""There's our tin man,"" she said as Erikson exited the vehicle. Then, she looked through the open passenger window at me. ""Y'know, we could still use a cowardly lion to round out the pack. You‚Äôre more than welcome to join us, Ray.""

""Would love to, Lin. 'Fraid I've got other plans though.""

""Oh?"" She cocked an eyebrow. ""Got a special date or something?""

Erikson nudged her with his elbow. She frowned in response. I recognized the signs of martial nonverbal communication well. An interesting thing to develop with someone. A language that can only be achieved after years and years of familiarity. I had that once, I like to think. But I was better at speaking it than interpreting it.

""I should be on my way,"" I said. ""Dany, get enough candy for the both of us, yeah?""

""We're gonna hit every house in town,"" the boy replied eagerly.

After that, I was back on the highway heading towards Sanguis. Overhead, the sun descended, gradually vanishing against the horizon. Black clouds billowed across the sky, wispy trails of ink that dispersed against the moon's unnatural glow. It was that time of year, the Hunter's Moon. When its white, snowy surface took on a pale orange hue and appeared about twice its normal size.

Along either side of the highway were thick patches of trees. Some with empty tops, their branches twisted like gnarled fingers. Others still retaining a mixture of red and brown leaves that swayed against the breeze.

I slowed down by mile marker ninety-six, crawling along the highway at a deliberate pace until my headlights spotted the gravel road Erikson told me about. Then, I turned off from the asphalt and followed the lane for another few minutes. It wasn't a long drive, but I was being cautious about deer or other wildlife. Nothing could ruin your day like a wild animal.

Rounding a bend, Sanguis appeared as if out of thin air. One second I was surrounded by dark forests and cornfields. Next thing I knew, there were dim street lamps and old brick buildings with vines wrapped around them like spiderwebs. Cookie-cutter houses of this era, greatly contrasted by the outdated shops along main street. Each one built directly beside each other, shoulder-to-shoulder because back in the day, no one really knew just how big a town could become. Everything was grouped together for convenience.

I had to pull off from main street along a backroad due to a line of barricades. It seemed the town was holding a Halloween festival. And with the overcrowded sea of cars, it looked as if everyone and their moms were in attendance.

I found a parking spot on a muddy field in between a Ford Puma and a Lincoln. I got on the radio to let the dispatcher know of my whereabouts and to see if there were any updates about the boy. So far, they hadn't heard anything. Just to be sure, I checked my phone, but I was too far out in the boonies for cell reception.

""Go figure,"" I muttered, pocketing my phone and stepping out from the jeep. I locked the car and started my trek for the only part of town that had any discernible sign of life.

In all my years, I'd never seen such spirited enthusiasm for Halloween. I've encountered some interesting costumes, attended a few lively parties, but Sanguis was on a completely different level.

Almost everyone wore a costume, and no outfit was the same. There were a few modern pop culture references. Kids dressed up as their favourite cartoon characters and superheroes and whatever else was popular to them. Adults varied in that some donned scarier outfits and makeup to appear as ghosts and ghouls and zombies. Some, mainly the younger crowd, were dressed in a more attractive fashion. Then, of course, there were a handful of people that didn‚Äôt bother with more than their everyday clothes.

I shouldered my way through the crowd, trying to ask about the boy, but I was consistently ignored. I imagine many mistook my uniform for a costume, and considering my age, they wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a middle-aged man with a tired face and sad eyes. Unruly hair partnered with faint stubble that was in an awkward phase between beard and clean-shaven. My only advances had been blind dates organized by mutual friends. But I didn‚Äôt have many acquaintances outside of work.

However, after enough searching, I was able to speak with a few of the locals. With the provided information, some had possible answers, but Thomas was a common name. Not to mention, many of the locals willing to speak with me were already inebriated and struggled to comprehend what I was asking. The music blaring through overhead speakers scattered about main street wasn't making my job any easier either.

There was nothing I could do about the festival, as much as I wanted to. I couldn't just make demands to shut it down or halt its progress. Sanguis wasn't within my county, and therefore, I had little say. I should've called someone to aid me, someone working within their jurisdiction, but I was impatient. Eager for answers.

Eventually, someone dressed as a sad-faced clown pointed to a nearby diner and told me I should speak with the mayor. I thanked them and went on my way.

Inside, the diner was packed from wall-to-wall. Every booth was filled, every stool taken, every inch of counter space occupied by food and drinks. The distinct scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, intermingled with the smell of cooked bacon grease and oil from an air fryer.

""Sorry, hun."" A hostess in a black apron had snuck up on me, appearing from a small cluster of girls dressed as vampires. ""There aren't any tables right now. Wait time will be about ten to twenty minutes. Maybe longer.""

I leaned in and asked: ""Is the mayor here?""

The woman looked me up and down, studying my face. ""Oh, you're not from around here.""

""That obvious, huh?""

""I've got an ear for accents and a memory for faces. 'Specially one as handsome as yours.""

She was lying in hopes of getting a tip.

""You wouldn't happen to know of a little boy named Thomas, would you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYounger, between eight and ten. Brown hair. Blue eyes.""

""Might be Tommy Milner. His daddy has a farm up the road.""

""Sweet corn?""

Her lips twisted with amusement. ""Sheep and pigs mostly.""

""Right,"" I said. ""Now, about the mayor...""

She turned and pointed to a booth at the back of the restaurant. A man in a suit sat alone. Darker skin, curly black hair cut short, quiet but seemingly amicable as he politely nodded or waved at a few other patrons passing by on their way for the side exit.

""Thanks a bunch."" I left the hostess and maneuvered the crowd until I stood before the mayor's table. ""Got a moment?""

He looked up from his half-eaten meal. His eyebrows knitted together with consternation. ""Do we know each other, friend?""

I extended my hand. ""Raymond Solanis; deputy sheriff from Halleran County.""

A charming smile lifted the mayor's lips, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth. A politician's grin. Warm, attractive, but not so defined as to appear creepy or intense. Small lines around the corners of his mouth said he must've donned it often.

""Mayor Michael Briggs."" He grasped my hand firmly and shook it. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, have a seat. Are you hungry? Best bacon this side of the river.""

Best bacon and sweet corn, I thought. What can't you people do?

""No,"" I said, ""but thank you.""

He nodded and lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth. ""I like your costume.""

""You do realize I'm actually a deputy sheriff, right?""

""And I'm dressed up as the very handsome mayor of Sanguis.""

""Doesn‚Äôt really seem like a costume to me.""

""Of course it is."" The mayor grinned. ""You and I are nothing more than men. This, the clothes we wear and the business we conduct, are roles in a play. The world is a stage, my friend, and we are simply trying to give our best performance before the curtain inevitably falls.""

I had to wonder if it wasn't just coffee in the mayor's cup.

""The reason I'm here,"" I explained, ""is about a boy my partner and I found on the highway. Might be a local from your town. Tommy Milner?""

""Ah, Tommy. Kind young man. Hard worker. You say you found him on the highway?""

I quickly recalled the day's earlier events. How the boy came running out of the woods barefoot and afraid. As if he were being chased.

""I see."" The mayor rubbed his hand along the length of his jaw. ""Is he okay?""

""He's being treated at a hospital about half an hour from here. I was hoping to get in contact with the parents, verify the boy‚Äôs identity.""

""You and your partner?""

""Just me."" I don't know why, but then I said: ""Partner's on standby at the hospital. Waiting for any updates.""

The mayor took another sip of his coffee as he considered this. There was a hint of distress in his eyes as if he were trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces. Bemused by the news given to him.

""Well, Deputy, I can't say I've heard from the Milners. Then again, it has been a busy day with the festival. Why don't we take a ride up to the farm and check in on them?""

""I would appreciate that, Mayor.""

He collected his coat from the booth and rose to his feet. I followed closely behind him. As we neared the main entrance, he stopped and whistled.

Somehow, through the bustle of the diner, a woman at the far end of the counter perked up and met the mayor's gaze. She stood from her stool, threw down a twenty dollar bill on the counter, and joined us outside.

It was then I got a better look at the woman. Lithe frame and hard jaw. Steely eyes with an indifferent expression. She wore a black police button-up beneath a Kevlar vest.

""Deputy Solanis, meet Officer Katherine Barsad,"" the mayor introduced. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs our local law enforcement.‚Äù

""Kat,"" she said curtly.

I tried to shake her hand, but the mayor was already on the move, and she was quick to keep up with him.

We all piled into Officer Barsad's cruiser and drove deeper into town, past the buildings and streets onto a muddy road that led us to the countryside. The trees returned but swiftly gave way to endless fields of corn.

""You know, Deputy,"" said Mayor Briggs, ""it seems strange for you to be all the way out here.""

""Lucky that I was, otherwise young Tommy might still be walking the highway.""

The mayor glanced over at me in the passenger seat, still awaiting some sort of explanation.

""I was going around handing out flyers for a missing girl, Alys,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTrying to raise awareness; see if I couldn‚Äôt shake something loose.‚Äù

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but they have Amber Alerts and news channels for that, don't they?""

""Smaller communities aren't alway fully connected to the network. And I've got me something of a restless mind. Need to keep busy.""

""Workaholic or guilty conscience?""

Instinctually, I tensed at the question. In the backseat, Officer Barsad shifted her body to face me. It was then I realized just how cramped the car was, and how strange it'd been for the officer to relinquish the driver's seat to the mayor. Then again, he was technically her boss. But in my experience, whenever I was with the sheriff, he always rode shotgun.

""You know why they call this town Sanguis?"" the mayor asked. ""Back in the late 1800s, around the civil war, there was a battle here. You see for a time, Missouri was considered a border state. You know what a border state is?""

""When the state's loyalty was divided between the Confederacy and the Union. Neither fully one or the other.""

""Very good, Deputy."" He raised his eyes to look at Officer Barsad in the rearview mirror. ""We've got a learned man in our midst.""

We turned off the road and started up a long winding lane towards a plain farmhouse with a sloped roof. The yard light was off, and the inside of the house was dark.

""The battle was as bloody as they get,"" Mayor Briggs continued. ""Brothers against brothers, fathers against sons. In fact, there‚Äôd been so much bloodshed, it soaked into the dirt and turned the waterways red for a time. It almost caused the town to collapse completely, but where there's a will there's a way.""

""And that connects to Sanguis how?""

We came to a stop in the empty driveway. The mayor turned towards me, the leather of his seat squeaked with his movements. ""Sanguis is the Latin word for blood. Not our proudest moment but perhaps our most defining.""

Slowly, under the cover of the shadows, I slid my right hand across my body, resting it on my revolver. ""Is that so?""

There was a hint of disappointment in the mayor‚Äôs smile. ""Unfortunately."" Then, he unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. ""Are you coming?""

I opened my door and stepped out, Officer Barsad lingered a few paces behind us. A spectator in this investigation. Easy to forget if you weren‚Äôt careful.

We followed the cobblestone path to the porch and knocked on the front door. There was no response, so we knocked again. The mayor called out to the Milners, alerting them of his presence. Still, nothing.

""What do you think, Deputy?"" the mayor asked. ""Should we get a warrant? I imagine it might be difficult for you considering county lines.""

I looked back at Officer Barsad. ""Suppose I should let you take the lead.""

She remained still, her eyes going to Briggs for instruction. He nodded lightly, and she stepped forward, trying the handle. The door swung open to darkness and the smell of honey ham.

I removed a flashlight from my belt. Officer Barsad did the same. We entered the house, our beams of light crawling across the floorboards and walls. I kept my right arm rested on the grip of my revolver, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

In the hallway, I found a picture hanging on the wall. It was a family photo of the Milners. Mother, father, and son. The boy was the very same I'd encountered on the highway.

Suddenly, the overhead lights came on. Mayor Briggs stood with his finger still on the switch, grinning at me with a sense of pity.

""Keep your eyes on the sky,"" he said, ""and you'll trip over the roots beneath your feet.""

We turned off our flashlights and wandered the house, calling out to the Milners. There was no sign of life, no sign of a disturbance either. The house sat empty and still, untouched. Then, as I returned from the hallway, I stopped in the dining room. The dinner table was set with three plates, the food on each plate partially eaten. Something had interrupted their supper and forced them to abandon their home halfway through a meal. No time to clean up, no time to pack, no time to do anything but leave. Where had they gone?

14/02/2025 

One year ago we were in your new house and you were cooking dinner for me. I was ok with no celebration. 
Soon, one year since you proposed and even tho i was happy i will never forget looking across the park and being jealous of the other couple: 
He planned it. They had üß∫ set up. While you proposed to me on the other side of the park in the dark. I brushed it off. Fair enough, you are a guy and I thought that you were doing your very best. 
One year almost since we almost canceled the wedding because you ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to tell me you were texting your ex, you told her about your house but didn‚Äôt mention you were getting married in 7 days. 
Almost one year since we got married with only two witnesses and went for a dinner. I didn‚Äôt get married in a white dress or with flowers because you didn‚Äôt want it to feel like a wedding to not steal anything for the day we would have money to throw a party. 

If im here is because of you. I was ready to go back home until one damn day i went on a date with you and took me 1 second to think: ‚Äúi have met my husband‚Äù and 5 minuted to text all my friends letting them know. 
I told you ‚ÄúI LOVE YOU‚Äù first and you didn‚Äôt say it back.
I have tried to run away to not get hurt. 
I used to keep my feelings inside my head. 
You begged for me to believe in you and with time I would because you would turn your words into action. 
You made me share my feelings.
You used to see me at least 4x a week. 

Then i moved in. Took care of your house and you. My mental health got worse. My drinking got worse. I have asked for help. All the drama in my life was too much. To show you love i kept everything clean, worked very hard to not ask for money, gave up on my plans, gave up on having kids or pets. Even my mum. I didn‚Äôt feel pretty anymore. 

With time, you were telling me more and more about what your ex used to do and you didn‚Äôt like. I was the problem. You needed peace and space. 

While i was trying to regulate my mood and emotions you used to come to me for cuddles. And i needed to do it even if i didnt want to because we would only be together when you wanted. 

We turned out to be friends who fuck. 

Im in the high risk group cancer because you gave me the virus. 

You didn‚Äôt give me anything for Christmas, anything for new years. I gave you my soul. 

I was begging for you to talk to me. I begged for you to let me know if your feelings where changing so i could bring you back to me. 

I miss taking care of you. I miss giving you baths. Cuddling.

The man who used to wake up before me to grab a coffee couldn‚Äôt cross the street to get me one on my bday. 

That night broke my heart. I had an overdose. With the medication you ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù. You kicked me out. Asked me to go back to my country. Left my stuff in the backyard. Ran away to your dad, 6 hours away. While i was crying on your door late night on a Wednesday because i wanted to sleep in our bed, with my husband. 

And here I am‚Ä¶ so full of love. No hate. Asking for the man i have met. The love of my life, my pretty nose back. I know the mistakes i have done. 

Im doing much better but i miss you. 

Come back home, come back to me. My heart is your home. Call me. Let me help. 

I love you B. ",1,1739511693.0,letters,1,1.0,False
1ip3oxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/paralegal/comments/1ip3oxy/i_am_reeling/,I am REELING,"I work on a small team of paralegals under a managing attorney. We are part of a larger entity. I've been here just under two years. 

Since day one, one of the other paralegals, Janet, has had it in for me. The reasons why are complicated, and they're genuinely not my fault. She's yelled, she's cried, she's threatened, she's attempted manipulation, she's even threatened to quit unless I was fired. 

To avoid a long boring story, just believe me when I say I get along with pretty much anyone and I don't wish anyone any ill. I've never done anything to harm this woman other than refuse to be her secretary. I like my job, and I just want to do the work and then go home at night and crochet with my cats.

On Friday the managing attorney quit unexpectedly with no notice period, for reasons unrelated to our team. Fortunately, our leadership was very responsive. We were immediately issued an interim manager. Everyone on the team started working on making sure our ducks were in order so that the job duties we are assigned could continue uninterrupted.

Except Janet. She took care of her work, but she also saw an opportunity to grind all her axes. She started working on making arrangements for tasks that the manager was responsible for. She saw it as an opportunity to make a bunch of changes to the team that she had been wanting to make for awhile that the departed manager had been saying no to. 

Now, nobody told Janet to work on the manager's tasks. Nobody even knew she was doing it until she sent an email this morning, ""Hey, I made arrangements for us to do XYZ going forward.""

I had talked to the interim manager and told her that Janet doesn't respond well to ""no."" No matter how gently or professionally it is said to her, she doesn't respond well. I'm not sure how much the interim manager believed me, though. The interim manager replied to Janet and very gently, politely, professionally, said, ""No thanks Janet, I already have XYZ handled."" But she was shocked by Janet's immediate reply saying she quit, effective immediately. And just in case anyone was unclear, she emailed the team the last of her open work tasks and basically said, ""Peace out!""

I meant it when I said I don't wish her any ill will. I know she's upset and probably very unhappy right now. However, the work was getting to her. I sincerely think she'll be better with some time off. 

I'm not dancing on her grave, but I am having lots of feelings. This coworker has been a source of horrible anxiety to me for a long time. This was a dream job for me and she immediately peed in my coffee. Tomorrow I'm going to get up and work and I don't have to worry about confrontations with her. I don't have to tipoe around. I don't have to worry about her calling the CEO in tears, again. And I don't have to worry about her trying, again, to get me kicked off the team or fired.

So, I met a guy in a professional setting and we hit it off. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was friend vibes or not, but I found him really cute and funny and wanted to explore. (Side note: I usually date women, but still find myself going back to men time to time).
We got coffee and conversation started professionally, but then he told me that he found me attractive and that cued me into the idea that this was in fact a date. After talking a while and going for a nice walk, I decided to ask if I could kiss him (bc I wanted to but also to check the vibes ig and it was really nice) and we kissed.

But then, things changed again‚Ä¶.He was so thrown off by the kiss. It really confused him. He said he enjoyed it but was no expecting it at all. It baffled him. I‚Äôve never gotten that reaction before. We talked through it for a really long time, and ultimately, it just made me feel so ashamed and embarrassed. I thought I had made some crazy impulsive decision and weirded him out. 

Flash forward to us hanging out a second time. He again brings up that it was the most interesting and confusing interaction he‚Äôs had (he said he thought I wanted to be friends until I did that). I apologized for kissing him, and said I needed to think through my decisions a little more before acting on them. We analyze things more and more, and both share that we aren‚Äôt looking for anything serious. 

While I had a great time, I eventually couldn‚Äôt get over the shame I felt after that first time. I realized I only had felt that because of what he said. As someone that is super comfortable in their sexuality, a kiss isn‚Äôt a big deal to me. 
After some time apart, and worried that this dynamic may not work out, I rejected him and said I was concerned that we may not want the same things.
I think he felt kind of played since I asked him out first, kissed him first, and then rejected him. I feel really bad, but I also feel like I did nothing wrong. Is kissing on the first date really a big deal??? Should I be more receptive to someone that believes that?? Did I mess up a professional relationship for no reason???

Nonetheless I‚Äôm seeking to find supplements that could help regain my minds over time. I only want positive input and support here because I know it‚Äôs possible. 

I‚Äôve read that citicoline, bacopa, ginkgo and lions mane have shown results for many but I wasn‚Äôt sure if there was a stack or a single supplement that has helped anyone? Any help is greatly appreciated. 

I‚Äôm currently taking Zoloft 50mg, Wellbutrin XL 150mg for medications (4 years) and as of a few days now bacopa 380mg, reishi 150mg, ginkgo 120mg, cordyceps 50mg, lions mane tincture 1200mg fruit & mycelium. 

I can‚Äôt take anything more stimulating because of the Wellbutrin and daily coffee intake (2cups) so that‚Äôs only piece I‚Äôm concerned about. I‚Äôve seen promising results with citicoline but idk how that would react with my medications? All my research suggests I‚Äôm fine.

I appreciate everyone's replies and the simplicity of the method. I now have a follow-up question though.

Which would be preferable: a 3-fund portfolio composed of FXAIX (60%) VTMGX (20%) FXNAX (20%), or a TDF (FFLDX) which is 55% total market US, 35% total market international, and 10% varied bond allocations? Or is this a case of six of one, half dozen of the other, with no reason to split hairs? Total ER would be under 0.1% either way.

I'll note in advance, this is a 401k, and there are no alternative funds available for the 3-Fund that would meet the boglehead ethos.

Flash frozen pods are not new. There is a brand Cometeer since 2015. Despite having fans, they haven‚Äôt grown very big because of price point and storage issues. Peyush was right at pointing out that it‚Äôs something not convenient for traveling as it needs to be frozen for storage. Also logistics might be a big problem for such product in India.

Anupam was totally on point that their price range is comparable to Nespresso and machine pods but they claim to be competing with instant coffee, which is available at much lower price than 60rs/cup Zenma charge. This price range customers can easily afford coffee machines.

I don‚Äôt always agree when a brand name is criticized, but here Sharks were were logical about their logo of Frozen Crema which might confuse an average customer. I explored their website/IG and seems they took Sharks feedback as site now shows ‚ÄúFrozen Espresso Pods‚Äù as Sharks suggested. 

Peyush in depth comment was perfect about crema being absent from Zenma‚Äôs cups. It‚Äôs most flavorful and aromatic part of a coffee cup. Modern coffee machines can easily create such cups with crema/froth in less than a minute. 

Finally Anupam saying it‚Äôs difficult to make this product a habit was also logical.

The pitchers were seeking an offer of ‚Çπ 60 Lakhs for 3.5% equity at the valuation of ‚Çπ 17.14 Cr. I can‚Äôt agree more on Sharks not investing.

This product might get some fans, but there are lots of blocks for an average customer. 

I wish them luck but great counter questioning from Sharks. Hats off. ",3,1739509747.0,sharktankindia,3,0.8,False

Timeline:
Listed on Thursday, Jan 23, 2025.
Hosted open house Jan 25 & Jan 26 (hosted from 2-5pm, adding an extra hr onto typical real estate agent's 2-4pm timing). Funny enough, our buyer visited at 4:45pm Jan 26, and was one of our last visitors.

After a few days of negotiations, offer was accepted Feb 1. 
Conditions waived and offer firmed up on Feb 11, 2025!‚úÖÔ∏è‚úÖÔ∏è

This process involved work on our end, but it was well worth it in my opinion. Here are the steps we took to facilitate this sale:
1. Rented a 10x10 storage locker and moved a whole bunch of furniture/stuff there to declutter our house and prepare it for staging. 
2. Found a real estate lawyer and worked out a fee structure that included them completing a few offer / APS reviews and provided advice which assisted us in our negotiations with buyer's agent.
3. Called a few staging companies and booked virtual consultations (no cost), then leveraged some of their recommendations when we staged the home ourselves.
4. Staged the home ourselves - used various items we had, and also buying ~$1000 worth of decor/fake plants/filler art/coffee table/pillows from Winners/HomeSense. All items were returned shortly after we accepted our offer, and full refunds were received 
5. Used forsalebyowner.ca to get our home listed on MLS / Realtor.ca. This service was well worth the ~$500 cost and necessary to market your home to realtors and the broader market. It included services like Comparative Market Analysis to assist with pricing, assistance with ensuring all MLS data is filled out accurately, and great customer service. Would recommend and use again.
6. Hired a professional real estate photographer for ~$175. This was well worth the cost and necessary to ensure your home shows well. They took professional photos, 3D Matterport virtual tour, and provided short videos which we were able to share on social media etc. This also included 30 property highlight brochures, that we provided to all open house + showings visitors.
7. We chose to offer 2.5% commission to the buyer's real estate agent. We didn't want to bother negotiating buyer's agent commission, as we've heard stories of realtors blacklisting your property and essentially doing anything to dissuade their clients from viewing/buying your house.
8. This should go without saying...but be professional, courteous, and available. You will (hopefully) receive many calls,  texts, and emails from realtors or prospective buyers. Answer their questions and try your best to accomodate their time to view your property when they request a showing. You will likely get real estate agents calling to question you and cast doubt, essentially trying to get you as a client. I even had a couple sarcastically ask me how many months I plan to stay on the market before I agree to let them sell my house for me. Stay calm and professional. I professionally let them know that I have done much research, we are priced competitively, and they can feel free to contact me or visit our open house if they have buyers who may be interested. 

A couple other things we ordered which you may find useful: lockbox from Amazon (so that realtors can come show the home to their clients without you being home to provide access) and Open House signs from Amazon.

I understand FSBO is not for everybody, as it requires time and effort which you'll need to balance along with your full time job, if you have one. However, I am extremely satisfied with the outcome of our first FSBO transaction, and plan to do this again if/when we sell our next home.

Received offer on Jan 27, 2025. 
After a few days of negotiations, offer was accepted Feb 1. 
Conditions waived and offer firmed up on Feb 11, 2025!‚úÖÔ∏è‚úÖÔ∏è

This process involved work on our end, but it was well worth it in my opinion. Here are the steps we took to facilitate this sale:
1. Rented a 10x10 storage locker and moved a whole bunch of furniture/stuff there to declutter our house and prepare it for staging. 
2. Found a real estate lawyer and worked out a fee structure that included them completing a few offer / APS reviews and provided advice which assisted us in our negotiations with buyer's agent.
3. Called a few staging companies and booked virtual consultations (no cost), then leveraged some of their recommendations when we staged the home ourselves.
4. Staged the home ourselves - used various items we had, and also buying ~$1000 worth of decor/fake plants/filler art/coffee table/pillows from Winners/HomeSense. All items were returned shortly after we accepted our offer, and full refunds were received 
5. Used forsalebyowner.ca to get our home listed on MLS / Realtor.ca. This service was well worth the ~$500 cost and necessary to market your home to realtors and the broader market. It included services like Comparative Market Analysis to assist with pricing, assistance with ensuring all MLS data is filled out accurately, and great customer service. Would recommend and use again.
6. Hired a professional real estate photographer for ~$175. This was well worth the cost and necessary to ensure your home shows well. They took professional photos, 3D Matterport virtual tour, and provided short videos which we were able to share on social media etc. This also included 30 property highlight brochures, that we provided to all open house + showings visitors.
7. We chose to offer 2.5% commission to the buyer's real estate agent. We didn't want to bother negotiating buyer's agent commission, as we've heard stories of realtors blacklisting your property and essentially doing anything to dissuade their clients from viewing/buying your house.
8. This should go without saying...but be professional, courteous, and available. You will (hopefully) receive many calls,  texts, and emails from realtors or prospective buyers. Answer their questions and try your best to accomodate their time to view your property when they request a showing. You will likely get real estate agents calling to question you and cast doubt, essentially trying to get you as a client. I even had a couple sarcastically ask me how many months I plan to stay on the market before I agree to let them sell my house for me. Stay calm and professional. I professionally let them know that I have done much research, we are priced competitively, and they can feel free to contact me or visit our open house if they have buyers who may be interested. 

A couple other things we ordered which you may find useful: lockbox from Amazon (so that realtors can come show the home to their clients without you being home to provide access) and Open House signs from Amazon.

I understand FSBO is not for everybody, as it requires time and effort which you'll need to balance along with your full time job, if you have one. However, I am extremely satisfied with the outcome of our first FSBO transaction, and plan to do this again if/when we sell our next home. It takes effort, determination, and patience, but can save you tens of thousands of $$$ on realtor commission fees.

Good luck!

# 10.1 News of Liu‚Äôs Death

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people. The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

**10.1-2**

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting. Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2 of this book, which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words ‚ÄúFormer Generation‚Äôs Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate‚Äù. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English, her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

Note 10.1-2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous chapter 2, when I was two years old, I didn‚Äôt understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

# 10.2 Big Bang

One afternoon, I suddenly felt a stomach-ache and suspected that Dufferin gang (hostile forces) wanted to kill me and instruct my colleagues to poison my coffee. I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire Chapter 2 ""Peach Blossom Catastrophe"" (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words ‚ÄúFormer Generation‚Äôs Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate‚Äù. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist ‚Äúintelligence of not seeing the top‚Äù (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

**10.2-1 Ileus**

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and ‚Äúill air‚Äù were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation when I was a child (see chapter 12), so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the ‚Äúill air‚Äù shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove ‚ÄúTrue Air‚Äù down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the ‚ÄúTrue Air‚Äù touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the ‚ÄúIll Air‚Äù reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

https://preview.redd.it/bqzey674d1je1.jpg?width=2137&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a81b310b757445f29be92e6d5d01597043adc743

**10.2-2 Big Bang**

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 10.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about these many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my ‚Äútrue air‚Äù to attack the ‚Äúvagal rheumatic air‚Äù that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those ‚Äúevil airs‚Äù were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my ‚Äútrue air‚Äù. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen ‚Äúvagal rheumatic air‚Äù groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

**Note 10.2.2**

Illustration 10.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of ‚Äútrue air‚Äù (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 10.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or ‚Äúphilosopher-stone sword‚Äù inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka. Jade Girl) is the right way to cure his illness and save him from hell.

**10.2-3 I surrendered.**

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" (cf. v. 8.2 ""Die with Eyes Open""). I had very little ‚Äútrue air‚Äù left (note, gathering and transporting ‚Äútrue air‚Äù requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The ‚Äútrue air‚Äù will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of ‚Äútrue air‚Äù flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used ‚Äútrue air‚Äù to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved ‚Äútrue air‚Äù along the ‚ÄúShou Shao Yin heart sutra‚Äù (as shown in Figure 10.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with ‚Äútrue airs‚Äù. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense). The Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

**Note 10.2.3**

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 10.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don‚Äôt even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep ‚ÄúGratitude Resentment Love and Hatred‚Äù relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my ‚ÄúGratitude Resentment Love and Hatred‚Äù relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the ‚ÄúPresent Quantity‚Äù (see 11.4.5 Sense Node), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes ‚ÄúPresent Quantity‚Äù, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the ‚ÄúPresent Quantity‚Äù. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 10.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 10.2.3-3 is the ‚ÄúPhilosopher-Stone Pestle‚Äù in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus‚Äù, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the ‚ÄúDie with Eyes Open‚Äù.

I've never been very good at explaining things. Whenever I try to get my thoughts and memories out, they come out in random clumps of nonlinear mish-mash. However, due to recent events, and with help from friends and professionals, I have decided the most healthy thing to do is to try to get some of it out in writing. You can't suppress memories forever.

  


Right now the event I can best recall is the exact night when I began to see him again. I didn't know it was him at the time. It started about three months after I the phone call at work that resulted in an embarrassing breakdown, and was forced to stay on unpaid leave until further notice. I'll try to formulate that event into something coherent another day.



I had just gotten home from getting groceries. I felt my body ache and complain about my late nights as I climbed the stairs to my apartment, pushing the key in with my fingertips, opening the door with my elbows, and trying not to drop anything, I was greeted with a very loud meow, and the rapid footsteps of a little monster coming to see who was at the door.

  
  
‚ÄúToo bad you don't have any thumbs, you could've me with this,‚Äù I tell Charlie as I set the bags of groceries down on the counter.

  
  
Her little orange and white face meowed in response. She hurriedly ran towards the sound of rustling paper bags, curious to see what was found today at the discount bin, and jump inside if there was enough space. I wrestled around with her while trying to get everything out from the bags, and after a bit, I managed to sort various cans of soup and pasta into the once-empty cabinets. I put the last bit of food away in my freezer, peeling off red stickers labeled with an expiration date of tomorrow, and then opened the window to let the stale air in my apartment out.

  
  
Trying to keep my eyes open, I shifted quickly through a thick stack of mail before tossing it aside to join a larger pile of unopened envelopes. The keywords and names my mind got used to scanning for weren't there.



Charlie popped her head out to look at me and started to purr as if she knew what I was thinking. I thought that after being together this long she could read my mind, and know exactly what I was thinking about, but with how she is I doubt much really happens inside that brain of hers. Realistically it was probably just her internal clock telling her it was time to start the daily routine we had worked ourselves into over the past few months.  


She bounced behind me as I cleaned the apartment from top to bottom, went through my emails, made my daily meal, checked the locks at least two times, those cheap locks always managed to unlatch in the middle of the night, and then cleaned again before it got too dark. Finally, when the sunlight stopped coming through the windows, we retired to the workroom to try and keep ourselves awake as long as possible. I tried, anyway, Charlie had no issue dosing off immediately underneath the table as I started to busy myself with small arts and crafts projects.

  
  
At that time, I had a lot of issues with my sleep pattern. Every time I woke up I would feel like I had run a marathon, and since I was out of work I had decided that the best course of action for me was to stay awake as long as I could. It had started shortly after I was let go, so I thought that clearly, the lack of my everyday routine must have had something to do with it. As soon as I was able to go back to my routine I would be able to sleep a full eight hours again every single night. Until then I tried everything I could to keep my mind busy.



A random video played on my phone beside me, the laptop in front of me was in the middle of some science article I had stopped reading a couple of hours ago, and arranged in a small ring around me were various cups of coffee, and bottles of cola I had been unhealthily drinking over the night. I've never had any coffee before in my entire life until around that time and honestly thought I was experiencing a heart attack the first time I had a cup. However, over a short amount of time, it lost its energizing effect. It turns out coffee also had a limit to how long it could keep a person awake.  


Focusing on several things strained my eyes heavily. Instead of closing both of them at once and risking falling asleep, every once in a while I would close one eye at a time to give them a bit of a break. I close one of them, put pressure on it with my palm, open it again, and then do the same with the other. Other times I would look up from my desk and stare down the hallway to my bedroom, to give my eyes something a bit further away to focus on for a moment.

  
  
The workroom sat on the other side of my apartment, separating them was a hallway about fifty feet long, splitting off to the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. During the day, from the other end of the apartment, I can see everything. I could see the edge of my bed, curtains, small nightstand, and the red-lit numbers on my alarm clock. Sometimes in the night, when I sat in my chair and looked up from whatever I was doing, I could still make out the shape of everything in the dark.  


Even when it was pitch black, it was still familiar to me. I could focus and make out the shapes of the furniture and where everything was supposed to be. The edge of the bed, curtains, nightstand, the red-lit numbers. If I stared and focused hard enough I could even tell what time it was from where I sat. Every once in a while though the shadows would play tricks on me, dancing in weird patterns to make me think I saw something when I hadn't. The red of the alarm clock became eyes instead of numbers, the curtains arms, and the table a small freakish body. When this happens I would take a deep breath, not panic, and instead, tell myself that I have to close my eyes to let them rest a moment before opening them again. When I open them again I would realize there is nothing there.

  
  
This was one of those times. I stared too long and started to see something form within the shadows. I groaned and closed both of my eyes, rubbed them with my palms, and then took another look. It didn't help, the shadows at the end of the hall still bent, and twisted, playing with my mind. I squinted harder, a heavy pressure bored into my eye-lids, threatening to snap them close again. On the other side of my apartment, beyond the open bedroom door, was a wall of darkness completely unfamiliar.  


Maybe the batteries ran out on my alarm clock. That's why everything looked so confusing. The red of the numbers must have been a sort of reference point for my brain and now that the clock went out I'm not able to make out where everything else in the room was. But this was the exact thing I was worried about when I bought the alarm clock. I was afraid that the batteries would go kaput in the middle of the night and I would wake up late for work. Because of that, I bought one with a cable that I could plug into the wall.

  
  
My stomach sank even deeper as I sat up in my chair, trying to be more alert. I questioned if I had to unplug it earlier for something when suddenly a shadow shifted in the darkness. A piece of black that was a completely different shade of black had sat itself upwards in the void. The pressure I had felt suddenly squeezed my chest a bit tighter in response. I took a hard deep breath, struggling to keep my eyes open, as I stood up from my desk.

  
  
At the moment I felt either a surge of stupidity or braveness but I wanted to see who or what it was. Suddenly the shape moved again, rising higher from its current spot and stopping. The burst of energy I had left my body instantly and I kept my eyes glued to it, not wanting to blink and miss another sudden flinch or movement. I didn't think whoever was there knew that I could see them. I needed to call for help. My phone was charging in the kitchen, and if I was quiet enough I could sneak by, grab it, and call the police to report an intruder had broken into my home.

  
  
Of course, that's what it had to be right? Maybe I forgot to check a lock or left a window open somewhere. I focused hard, forcing my already strained eyes to try to gather more details from stranger. I tried to make out a face, height, or any distinctive, but my exhausted vision twisted the shapes too far. Each limb looked too long to be normal, the legs bent at strange angles, and the arms scrapped the ground. The face, or where its face should have been located, was shrouded in a black indistinguishable from the darkness around it.

  
  
Carefully I stepped around my desk, not wanting to take my eyes off of the intruder when suddenly they moved again. They slid to the right, then tried to take a step but shot their leg too far. It slid out from underneath them, almost sending them toppling over but suddenly freezing before they hit the floor. With a loud crack and pop it slipped back up, resetting itself with one leg forward.  


Panic started to slowly take hold as I stopped fighting against my body. I let my eyes shut and open again and again, hoping each time that the shape would be gone but it still stood there motionless. Whoever it was at the end of the hallway knew I was there. They moved when I moved, and now the two of us stood frozen staring each other down. I raised my leg to make another move, and the intruder did the same, raising a leg a bit too high to take a normal step and let it hover in the air. I go to lower my leg, and the intruder lets his fall to the ground, sliding out from under him with a crunch before pulling itself straight up.  


My mouth fell open, I wanted to shout something intimidating, to lie and tell them I was armed or that the police were already on their way. Anything to break the silence before I planned to reach out and slam the door to my workroom shut. I started to shout, sucking in air and filling my lungs but before anything got past my throat the stranger beat me to it. The shadows where its mouth should be snapped open and cracked, sending a wet tear down the hallway, followed by a faint desperate gasp for air.

  
  
‚ÄúMeow‚Äù

  
  
My chest jumped so hard at that moment that I thought I had died. I spun around in a panic to see Charlie poke her head around her sleeping spot behind the table looking just past me. A faint meow comes from the other end of the apartment, making me spin back around to once again see the red glow of my alarm clock.



Five twenty-three in the morning, cold blue rays of daylight forming beyond the curtains. Gradually the shape of my bed, night table, and curtains slowly come back into view. I take a long deep breath and rub my temple, leaning back against my desk, and finally close my eyes for longer than a second at a time, giving them the rest that they begged for. Charlie purred and hopped onto the table, rubbing herself against my arm and wanting attention.

  
  
‚Äúbedtime?‚Äù

  
  
Charlie only purrs in response. She's a cat, if someone had broken into the apartment she would have picked it up and alerted me, no matter how quiet the intruder was.



I guess I had no choice anymore. I did everything in my power to avoid it but when it came to visual and auditory hallucinations, maybe it was time to give in and get some shut-eye. Everyone has a limit, and I had pushed mine too much. I carefully took the little white noise machine in my arms and held her close to my chest, the two of us taking a moment to stare down the hallway together before leaving the room. The dark we were met with was empty and familiar like it always was.",2,1739508970.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Should I just move?,"I honestly have hooked up with lots of attractive white women off of dating apps. But I‚Äôm getting tired of hooking up and I‚Äôd only ever really want to settle down with a Chinese/Taiwanese woman, someone who shares my culture and I can relate to on a deep level. My culture is something I really value.

Some details about me:
* Early 30s Chinese American in Seattle
* 6‚Äô tall, decent looking and in great shape (slightly muscular, lean K-pop build)
* Great fashion and hair
* Have lots of friends so pretty sociable. I am an introvert and don‚Äôt like socializing though.
* Pulling really good money as a software engineer. My job is tied to Seattle though, so I would likely need to find a new job to move.
* I also have honestly pretty interesting hobbies too, but I don‚Äôt wanna dox myself

But honestly, it feels like Asian women, especially East Asian women won‚Äôt give me the time of day on dating apps.
* Tinder and Bumble you can‚Äôt filter by race.
* Hinge I literally ran out of Asian women in a 15 mile radius
* I‚Äôm recently trying Coffee Meets Bagel, which is promising. There seem to be lots more international Chinese women who I‚Äôm open to, but nothing concrete yet

I‚Äôm thinking of just flipping the table and moving to LA. I know I‚Äôm not some Joe Schmo who can‚Äôt get laid in general because I‚Äôm obviously having a lot of success with white women‚ÄîI know I‚Äôm a catch.

**PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING:**

Hi There!

I'd appreciate some feedback regarding the layout I came up with for my living room and dining room. I created this mock-up using a free website, so the furniture and colors of anything, aren't exact. So, pay no mind to the aesthetic of the room. I'm looking for feedback regarding space planning.

What is exact, are the dimensions of the room and the furniture.

**There is a few quirks of the living rooms that I'd like to identify and explain.**

The fireplace is left of the entrance to the house. To the right of the door is a half-wall.

The curve at the bottom right of the floorplan is a half wall, given by the kitchen countertop. The countertop is tall and has an overhang so that you can place stool seating underneath it. You'll see I added two stools to some of the counters there.

**Below is an outline of all the items in the floorplan for easy identification:**

1. Fireplace
2. Shoe cabinet (located to the left of fireplace
3. Armchair
4. 2 Console tables
5. Couch
6. End table
7. Circle coffee table
8. TV
9. TV Stand
10. Piano
11. Shelves
12. Dining table
13. Cabinet
14. Circle Mirror
15. 1 Piece of Art
16. 4 Rugs

Let me know what you would change. If you have any questions, I'm happy to clarify!

1ip2wtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MayConfessionAko/comments/1ip2wtl/mca_naging_kabet_ako_ng_kawork_mate_ko/,MCA | Naging Kabet ako ng kawork mate ko.,"I'm working as a call center agent. I've been with the company for almost 4 years and I never fell inlove with my co-workers ever! 

Last year, September. May mga bagong wave ng trainee's and super konti nila like 6 lang sila. Nakasabay ko yung guy sa locker and we looked each other and for some other reason, napa balik ang tingin ko sa kanya. 

The other day, lagi kona sya nakikita and I realize na crush ko syaaa. He's cute, baby face, wearing eyes glasses, look weirdo, tall, white and he has a beautiful eyes.

Everytime na mag lunch kami ng friend ko lagi ko sya nakikita sa tambayan (smoking area). And as the times goes by, lalo ko syang na gugustuhan. I'm glad na yung nag handle sa kanya as Team Head is my friend and used her as bridge para mapalapit sa kanya.


So everytime na we go on lunch, I always ask my friend (TeamHead) kung asan sya since lagi nyang kasama yung crush ko. Hanggang sa lagi na silang kasama sa smoking area with my friends.


After few weeks lagi nasyang kasama samin after shift since we used to play mobile games para palipas oras before umuwi. Halos everyday kami nakatambay and naenjoy koyon. I told to my friend na gusto ko yung Trainee. And I ask her na mag yaya ka ng inuman sa bahay and yayain sya.


Natuloy yung inuman na plano sa bahay which is sa apartment ko and I'm glad na nakapunta sya. Halos di ako naimik kapag nasa harap sya as in natatameme ako and stuck.


My friend ask him if taga san sya l, he said ""I'm from bulacan."" My friend said, ""Oh pano ka napunta dito"" 
(Sa pasig area kami) He said ""Im living with my boyfriend and we are renting an apartment sa cubao and 4 years na kami."" 


First of all I didn't know na may boyfriend sya. At nag marinig koyon, gumuho ang mundo ko. And nagpakalasing talaga ako sa inuman nayon and I feel safe din naman since sa apartment lang namin kami nag inom.


Hey stayed for a while sa apetment after inuman and umuwi din agad. When I wake up I called my friend and sinabi ko yung naramdaman ko nung nalaman kong may boyfriend sya.


Monday shift, medyo ilang padin ako kausapin sya since alam kong kay feelings na ako sa kanya at nakadagdag nadin yung nalamang kong may boyfriend sya. He already endorse sa production floor kaya lagi ko syang nakikita.


I message my friend (Yung team head nya) and I told her na crush ko ang anak anakan nya. She didn't notice na nasa likod pala nya yung crush ko at nabasa pa nya yung message ko! WFT! 


After shift, I decided na umuwi na agad at wag ng tumambay with them kasi nahihiya ako na nalaman na nya na may gusto ako sa kanya knowing na my boyfriend sya.


When I get home, he messaged me on IG.
Him: Umuwi kana? 
Me: Yes. medyo masama lang pakiramdam ko.
Him. Sayang naman, play pa sana tayo. Inom ka agad gamot. 


OMG!!! super kilig ko that day. I told my self na play play lang to and happy crush lang. So everyday na kami magkausap and dumating na point na super seryoso na nung mga usapan namin.


He asked nadin na mag sabay kami lunch as in dalawa lang kami. Everytime na sabay kami I never talk to him. Sa IG lang kami nag uusap and hindi sa personal.


After a week, he asked me if gusto kodaw mag coffee. Sumama naman ako and I feel like nagbibigay na sya ng motive sakin. I enjoy his company while we're together. 


We used to go on date every weekend and nag sleep nadin sya sa bahay halos everyday. I didn't ask him about his boyfriend while mag kasama kami.


November 27, 2024. He asked me to go sa apartment nya dahil wala daw don yung boyfriend nya for a week. That time dun ko na convince yung self ko na KABET nga ako.

It didn‚Äôt wake me up though, just had my watch data. The HR data is continuous on my watch so it literally was an instantaneous jump, like a step function.

I‚Äôve had several episodes where my heart rate abruptly jumps up and stays like that for awhile during the day too. Those cases it‚Äôs been in the 140s though, at least during the times I‚Äôve had my watch on to catch it. I most certainly can feel when it‚Äôs happening too, without having my watch on. It feels like a switch gets flipped, and distinctly different than when my HR is high from exercise ‚Äî kinda clunky/choppy vs feeling smooth? I also feel really dizzy during it, but haven‚Äôt actually fainted.

I‚Äôve brought it up to a doctor but they said it‚Äôs anxiety ‚Äî the thing is I‚Äôm genuinely not anxious or stressed whatsoever and the episodes seem to come randomly while doing mundane things. I quit my daily cup of coffee, I took the anxiety pills I was prescribed, but nothing has really had an effect ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually getting more and more frequent (started as a one off rarity, now it‚Äôs like every couple days).

I have a little medical knowledge since I have an EMT cert (although that was awhile ago and it‚Äôs not my profession), to me this seems like SVT symptom wise but the rate seems too low? Trying to decide if I should seek further care, or if the doctor was most likely right. If it‚Äôs happening literally during my sleep though, I feel like that proves it can‚Äôt be psychological, but the doctor seemed really confident so idk.

It really helped that it was the groom's house because I can so easily picture him there, as you can imagine his name comes up in the speech a lot. I could also use two or three parts of a single room to place the speech into because I had so much detail.

1ip2v5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ip2v5l/the_stranger_at_2_am/,The Stranger at 2 AM,"It was night. The cold breeze cut through my jacket like it wasn‚Äôt even there, biting at my skin as I walked. The streets were quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. I hated how empty the city felt at this hour. It was like the world had gone to sleep, leaving me alone in a place that was supposed to be alive.

I felt cold, so I decided to stop at the nearest coffee shop, which happened to be Dunkin‚Äô Donuts. I entered, and the place was dead. No customers, no chatter, just the faint hum of an old refrigerator and an employee leaning on the counter, watching something on his phone. He barely acknowledged me as I walked up to him.

‚ÄúBlack coffee,‚Äù I said, my voice cutting through the silence. ‚ÄúHot.‚Äù

He gave a slight nod and turned to the machine. As I waited, I glanced around. The place felt... off. The fluorescent lights buzzed, flickering every few seconds. The chairs were all slightly misaligned, like people had just been there but left in a hurry. Something about it unsettled me, but I shook it off.

The coffee was ready. I picked up the steaming cup and made my way to a seat near the window. The warmth of the drink should have burned my tongue, but it didn‚Äôt. It felt warm, sure, but not *hot*. Not the kind of hot I was expecting. I stared into the dark liquid, watching the steam rise in thin, twisting tendrils. My mind wandered. Had I been here before?

The bell above the entrance jingled. I looked up, and that‚Äôs when I saw him.

A tall figure entered, dressed entirely in black. His coat draped over his frame like a shadow, and a wide-brimmed hat obscured his face. Something about him made my stomach twist. He walked to the counter, set a few crumpled bills down, hesitated for a moment, then turned to leave. I frowned. He hadn‚Äôt ordered anything. Hadn‚Äôt even spoken. Just... placed the money and walked away. The cashier didn‚Äôt react, didn‚Äôt even look up. It was like he never saw the guy. Like I was the only one who did. But that was impossible. Wasn‚Äôt it?

And he *looked* at me.

A chill ran down my spine. His eyes‚Äîif he had any‚Äîwere hidden beneath the brim of his hat, but I *felt* them boring into me. A long, silent stare. My hands tightened around my cup. Then, just like that, he walked out.

I let out a breath I hadn‚Äôt realized I was holding. Maybe he was high. Maybe just a weird guy. I tried to shake it off, but something about that encounter *stuck* to me. Like a bad aftertaste.

I checked my phone. The battery was almost dead. I pressed the power button, and the screen flickered to life. *2:00 AM.*

Wait. That didn‚Äôt make sense.

I had entered the shop around 11:15. I was sure of it. How the hell had *three hours* passed? I blinked at the screen, willing it to change, but the time remained. *2:00 AM.*

I swallowed hard. Maybe I had zoned out? Maybe the warmth of the shop had lulled me into a trance. I had been tired... hadn‚Äôt I? I shook my head, drained the rest of my coffee, and stood up.

The nearest bus station was a five-minute walk away. It was the only way to get home. As soon as I stepped outside, that same biting cold hit me again, sending a shiver down my spine. I pulled my jacket tighter around me and started walking.

Halfway there, the feeling crept up my neck. That *paranoia*. That ancient, primal instinct screaming at me from deep inside. Every strand of hair on my body stood upright. I felt watched. *Hunted.*

I stopped walking. The streets were empty. Too empty. No cars, no people, not even the usual flickering streetlights. Just silence. I turned my head slightly, just enough to catch a glimpse behind me.

Nothing.

I exhaled sharply and kept walking. My mind was playing tricks on me. I was just tired. The cold was getting to me. That was all.

But the feeling didn‚Äôt go away. In fact, it got worse.

My gut told me to look back again. My whole body *needed* me to look. It was unbearable. I finally caved, pretending to drop something so I could turn around.

And that‚Äôs when I saw him.

The same man. The one from the coffee shop. Standing at the far end of the street, perfectly still. His coat and hat blending into the darkness, but I knew it was him. I *felt* it. My breath hitched. He wasn‚Äôt walking. He wasn‚Äôt moving. Just *staring*.

I looked forward again. My heart pounded in my chest. I forced myself to keep walking, each step feeling heavier than the last. I could see the bus station now. Almost there. Just a little further.

I risked one last glance.

He was gone.

I should‚Äôve felt relief, but I didn‚Äôt. I hurried the rest of the way and sat on the cold metal bench. The bus was coming in two minutes. *Two minutes. Just sit. Breathe. You‚Äôre fine.*

The bus pulled up, and I stepped inside, my paranoia still gnawing at the edges of my mind. I sat near the driver, trying to push away the lingering fear. Then, I noticed someone sitting in the back. I hadn‚Äôt seen them when I entered.

I turned my head slightly to get a better look.

And my stomach dropped.

It was him.

Only this time, I *saw* his face.

Or rather, the *lack* of it. No eyes. No nose. No mouth. Just a smooth, blurred, gray-toned smear where his features should have been. Like an unfinished painting. Like something that wasn‚Äôt *meant* to be seen.

I snapped my head forward, my mind racing. *What the hell was that? Was I imagining things?* My hands were clammy, shaking. The air in the bus felt suffocating. I needed to know if he was still there. My instincts screamed at me *not* to look again, but I had to.

I turned my head back.

He was gone.

I felt like I was going to be sick. My breathing was ragged, my vision blurred. I staggered up and rushed to the driver. My voice came out cracked, panicked.

‚ÄúWho‚Äîwho was that man in the back?‚Äù

The driver glanced at me, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat man?‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúThe guy‚Äîblack coat, hat‚Äîhe was just there.‚Äù

The driver shook his head. ‚ÄúKid, you‚Äôre the only passenger I picked up.‚Äù

I felt my blood turn to ice. My body refused to move. I turned my head one last time.

Nothing.

I barely got the words out: ‚ÄúTake me to the nearest police station.‚Äù

The driver hesitated, eyeing me like I was crazy. I must‚Äôve looked the part‚Äîsweaty, pale, shaking. ‚ÄúCompany policy says I can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an emergency.‚Äù

Something in my voice must have convinced him, because he floored the gas and got me there in minutes. I stumbled out, approaching the officers at the entrance.

I had to think. I couldn‚Äôt tell them everything. They‚Äôd think I was insane. I had to be *smart* about this. I took a deep breath and carefully crafted my story. No disappearing acts. No faceless men. Just a regular stalker. Something *believable*.

I told them everything. They asked me a few questions, and I did my best to answer them. Since I had no way of getting home and would not even dare to after what had happened, I asked one of the police officers to escort me home.  
  
He said to me:  
  
""Alright, kid. I need to finish some paperwork, and it'll take a bit. Just enter the station, and wait a bit while I finish.""  
  
I gave him a grateful glance, but I was at a loss for words. All I did was walk. I felt weak and numb. Using what strength I had left, I kept my eyelids open. The warmth of the station hit me like a blanket as soon as I stepped inside. I took a seat close to the front door of the station to wait.

I was so tired.

So, so tired.

The warmth of the police station enveloped me, but it couldn‚Äôt chase away the chills that still ran down my spine. My legs felt weak beneath me as I dragged myself to a chair near the front door. The air inside was heavy, thick with the hum of fluorescent lights and the low murmur of distant voices. I could barely keep my eyes open. The adrenaline from the night had worn off, leaving me hollow, empty.

I leaned my head back, staring at the ceiling, trying to focus on anything but the images of the faceless man. My mind kept replaying his strange, silent stare, the way he seemed to vanish and reappear with each blink. I knew I was just exhausted, that I had to be. I had to be.

I closed my eyes for just a second.

Just to rest.

The cold wind cut through my jacket like it wasn‚Äôt even there, biting at my skin. I was walking again, my footsteps echoing in the empty city streets. The streets were still too quiet. The same eerie silence. The same stillness. It felt like the world had gone to sleep, leaving me behind.

I hated it.  
  
I needed to get out of here. But before I could move, I felt it.¬†The weight of eyes on me.¬†My heart skipped. I looked up, the same tall figure in black standing before me. The coat, the hat, the faceless stare. It was him.  


He was back.

No, no, no. I had already‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt real.

I took a step back, but my legs felt like stone. The figure didn‚Äôt move. He just stood there, watching me, waiting.¬†I turned to run, but my feet wouldn‚Äôt move. The streets stretched endlessly in front of me, and the world felt like it was shrinking, suffocating me.

The air grew thick. My lungs burned. The chill was unbearable.¬†Then, a sharp jolt.¬†I gasped and opened my eyes.¬†The police station. The chair. The hum of fluorescent lights. I was awake. Wasn‚Äôt I?

I glanced around, panic rising. The officer hadn‚Äôt returned. The room felt suffocating. The shadows in the corners were longer now, darker.



I froze.



From the corner of my eye, I saw him.

The faceless man. Standing just outside the door.

I stood up, my legs unsteady as I stumbled backward. My breath caught in my throat.



He was here.



I tried to scream, but my voice wouldn‚Äôt come. The door to the station was wide open now, the cold night air flooding in. His presence was suffocating, and all I could do was stare at him, paralyzed with fear.



Then, like a shadow in the night, he vanished.



Just like the last time.



I stumbled toward the door, desperate to escape, but when I reached it... the street outside was empty.

The street... I knew this place. I‚Äôd been here before. But I couldn‚Äôt remember when.



I looked at the clock on the wall.

2:00 AM.



The same time. Always the same time.

And then I understood.

I'm wondering if I need to give on ECC, CPU generation, NIC speed, form factor, or something else.  
  
I was trying to find a motherboard meeting the following requirements:

* Requirements:
   * mini-ITX
   * Intel-CPU-compatible
   * ECC-RAM-compatible
   * Max RAM >= 64 GB
   * M.2 NVME slot
   * \>=4 SATA 6 Gb/s ports
* Nice-to-haves:
   * \>= 1 2.5+ GbE network ports
   * IMPI

This NAS will be used only internal to my home network. I was planning on using TrueNAS, but this isn't set yet. It will be used for backing up my laptop and storing/serving my audio/video/picture collection via Jellyfin and Immich containers. My current home network is mostly WiFi 5 based, and my Jellyfin clients are all wireless. I was planning to plug the NAS directly into my firewall, which supports 1 GbE. I have no plans to wire my home to support 10 GbE anytime soon.

The only motherboard I've found that comes close is the Supermicro X11SCL-IF. It seems to meet all my needs, though only has 1 GbE. It's also is Intel Coffee Lake generation, so kind of long in the tooth.

I pulled out my phone as I sat down at the coffee shop, and took a sip of a far too overpriced Americano. *8:58*, my phone told me. I fought the urge to scratch my beard.

At nine, my phone gave a little ding. *Showtime*, I thought. Standing up, I tossed the mostly full cup into the trash on my way out the door.

Memory outages were a key part of modern society. Human memory, stored in the brain, had been proven to be wildly, incredibly, unreliable. A simple incision and insertion of the right technology into the brain, easily done through the nose, meant uploading your memories into cloud storage. Forever accessible, unchangeable, and encrypted for you and you alone.

I'd gotten my implant late, at the age of thirteen. A year later, it had been ruled medically acceptable to implant for children as young as five. Occasionally I wondered if there were things from my childhood I'd forgotten. 

Turning the corner, I tugged on the string inside the sleeve of my jacket. In the blank space between the security cameras of the firm, my appearance changed. My suit went from black to tan. I slipped on a pair of shades. And, of course, the classic - a bandana tied around my lower face.

I hit the back door right on time. The laser cutter sliced right through the security door. From the front, I could hear shouts, and the discharge of at least one stun gun. Hopefully, that was Brett, and not a security guard.

I took the stairs two at a time, and when one of the lawyers stepped out of their office, I slugged them right in the belly button. They folded and collapsed, fighting to breathe, and I slipped a zip tie around their wrists.

Paula came up the stairs behind me, the click of her shoes distinctive enough I didn't attack. We nodded to each other, and split up to different offices. The computer console wasn't locked, thankfully. I started scanning through files, deleting things at random. A firm like this had more documents and evidence stored than we could delete during the entire memory outage.

The files I needed to delete were sprinkled randomly throughout. No sense in giving the firm or the authorities a clue as to what we were after. Since most memory outages happened late at night, when businesses were closed and people were generally asleep, this was likely the only opportunity we would get.

Finishing, I stepped out. Paula was still working; she must have had to use the hacking program we got. I went downstairs and gave Brett a thumbs down, our agreed signal. Two employees were unconscious, the security guard and a secretary. ""Any problems?"" I asked.

He shook his head. We waited ten more minutes for Paula to come down, and we went out the door. In another blank spot, I took off the suit jacket and turned it inside out, so it looked like a windbreaker. I pulled off the fake beard and dropped it in a trash can in the park, along with a small vial of chemicals I cracked open. It would catch fire in about half an hour, eliminating the evidence.

At just past noon, I reached the ""safe house,"" a study room in the university library. We had jammed the lock that morning to ensure no one else came in.  Paula, now looking androgynously male rather than female, gave me a high five when I entered.  Brett showed up a few minutes later, his skin now several shades darker.

""Mission accomplished,"" I said. All of us had tears of happiness in our eyes.

Brett pulled out the device from under the table. ""Well. It's been nice working with you guys. We should probably change clothes before we wipe our memories.""

Changing back into our normal outfits was so much more comfortable; walking in dress shoes with false heels was a pain. All the costumes Paul had made went into the box; he would set them on fire if he followed the note in his own handwriting.  I stood at the door, a piece of paper in my own hand, and tried not to tense as Brett put the device against the back of my skull.

I stumbled out of the study room and down the hall. What was I doing here? Why was I at the library? I started to scratch my head, only then realizing I had a note in it. ""Eminent Domain paper due Friday"" it said in my own handwriting. Man, these memory outages were no joke; I guess I wasn't used to my brain remembering things without a computer backup to reference!

Three weeks later, I stood next to my mom in the courtroom, along with thirty other neighbors and their various family members. I nodded politely to Paul, the senior from two doors down, and got a short wave from another guy I vaguely recognized from the neighborhood and campus.

""The police and the city council are all in an uproar about those criminals who broke into the law firm,"" my mother was saying. ""But despite all the accusations, none of them had anything to do with us. We just got lucky that they deleted all the forms the firm claimed we signed to give up our houses.""

Something about what my mom said gave me a niggling feeling of dread, but I just couldn't put my finger on it. Oh well, it couldn't have been that big a deal.

If it was important, I would have remembered it.",4,1739507753.0,WritingPrompts,1,0.83,False

This is my first time writing romance, so please be 100% honest

*‚ÄúI never wanted to be Eclipse‚Äôs daughter. She was dark and evil and I was kind and pure. At first. I would help out every soul and spirit out of my realm, until one girl. Her name was Neptune. She offered me freedom. Freedom for my own sanity. She turned me into a vampire. She gave me the powers to turn into part of humanity. I could suck up the souls of the people who wandered into my realm, but no more than ten percent. My mom sent kid after kid to retrieve the crystals for Borderline Personality Disorder.*¬†

*‚ÄúFirst it was Inferno NightShine. He was miserable in his regular life. He wanted to become an entity like me and my mom. But I couldn‚Äôt fulfill what he so utmostly desires. I could only take that same ten percent. Inferno left, letting the darkness take over him, bit by bit.*¬†

*‚ÄúNext it was Skylar Ashwood. Cast out from the Realm of Angels, she was desperate for revenge. She reached out to Eclipse, using her own magic to set off all the alarms. Eclipse knew of her distress and sent me out to take her soul. I gained her empathy after she gave it to me. She didn‚Äôt want to become an entity, she just wanted peace for her life, and she believed I could give it to her.*¬†

*‚ÄúThird and Fourth came together. Avery and Phoenix Frost. They were like Dawn and Lilli. They were hurt and wanted a quick out. I made it quick. At the time, they would‚Äôve done anything and everything to get freedom from their pain. I took their souls and gave them blood. Just like they asked.*¬†

*‚ÄúFifth was a hard trip. Ember Winterglade. She refused to give me part of her soul unlike everyone else. She slowly was coaxed into it with my help, but when I bit her neck slowly and absorbed her soul, she was finally able to feel peace again. She watched herself calm her demons inside and thanked me eternally for ending her suffering. That was when I would be fifty percent done.*¬†

*‚ÄúSix and Seven knew what they were in for and they were quick about it. Lunar and Willow Silvermoon. They were sisters, and close ones they were. They went through everything, until Lunar completed her quest before Willow. She became ordained as an entity and Willow was alone once again. They both gave me ten percent, then once again, I felt more of my power drain as they gave me their souls. I was seventy percent of the way.*¬†

*‚ÄúEighty was the girl that was consumed by grief, Dawn Daybreak. She was a kind soul and it made my heart break that she was turning to this path. I bit her gently, and she barely felt a thing. I still think of her, knowing that she‚Äôs out there somewhere. I hope I‚Äôll see her again.*

*‚ÄúNinety was another girl that I‚Äôll remember for the rest of my life. Lilli Shadowbrook was a special girl. She told me her story, and I sat through it. At first, she was closed off to me, but eventually, she opened up. She needed the crystal for numbness, and I provided her with the means to get it.*

*‚ÄúFinally, it was Faye ShadowHeart. She didn‚Äôt have much she wanted, all she asked of me was to take some of her pain away and that I did.*¬†

*‚ÄúI met many souls that I connected with, and that I still think about. I miss them, now that I‚Äôm freed, but I regret nothing. Ever since I came to Earth, I‚Äôve been treated with kindness and respect, something that the Spirit Realm never gave me. I would happily call this place my home. As for the Spirit Realm, I can confidently say I‚Äôll never be back.‚Äù*

* *Lavender Starfall, January 15th*

	When Lavender was first transported to Earth, she knew nothing about what was coming for her, but she was desperate to learn.

	She moved in with a young lady named Aurelia Moonstone. Aurelia was kind to her, and taught her the necessary human functions to live in daily life. She taught Lavender what clothes people wear, how people style their hair, and many more pieces of knowledge that Lavender was very appreciative of.¬†

	After about a week, Lavender started making friends in her town. She met a girl, Evangeline Summershade. At first, Lavender thought they were just friends, but then she noticed peculiar things in their relationship.

Whenever Lavender looked up, she would see Evangeline staring at her, and when she noticed, Evangeline would blush and look away.

When the two would hang out, sometimes Lavender found herself subconsciously reaching towards Evangeline.

Evangeline was a tall, green eyed, brunette. She had layers in her hair, making her hair very fluffy when she had just dried it with a hair dryer.¬†

One day, the two girls were hanging out. Lavender was at Evangeline‚Äôs house for a sleepover, and Evangeline had just washed her hair. As she came out of the bathroom, Lavender couldn‚Äôt help but stare.¬†

‚ÄúWould it be weird if I asked you to brush your hair?‚Äù Lavender blushed profusely, ‚ÄúYour hair looks so soft!‚Äù

Evangeline laughed, ‚ÄúSure! I don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre friends!‚Äù

As Evangeline sat down in front of her knees, Lavender felt her heart beat faster. She brushed down Evangeline‚Äôs brown hair, feeling it brush against her hand. *Damn, she has really soft hair*, Lavender felt her face grow hot.¬†

*They were just friends‚Ä¶right?*



After Lavender finished, Evangeline sat up on the couch, and they started talking. Lavender noticed the direct eye contact that she was being given. Evangeline was blinking every now and then, showing off her long eyelashes. Lavender gushed over how stunning Evangeline was, and it made Evangeline‚Äôs face turn red.¬†

That night, they watched a movie together, but before they finished, they were asleep. Sleeping next to her best friend was something that Lavender believed would never happen. Eclipse made her believe that she was unloveable, but now she had a best friend that truly cared for.

However, Lavender found herself daydreaming about Evangeline. She imagined them *dating*. She imagined having cute little coffee dates, and hanging out at Lavender or Evangeline‚Äôs house. She imagined them going to the movies together, where one of them would fall asleep on the other‚Äôs shoulder.

*I‚Äôm still not in love, she‚Äôs my best friend*. She‚Äôd tell herself skepically.¬†

As their friendship continued, Lavender noticed Evangeline start to get closer and closer to Lavender. At first, Lavender paid no attention, but eventually, it became suspicious.¬†

One day, Lavender was hanging out at Evangeline‚Äôs house. She decided that she wanted to test her theory. *Was Evangeline in love with her?*¬†

‚ÄúHey Evangeline,‚Äù Lavender took a breath, trying to act serious, ‚ÄúI like this girl, do you know how I could ask her out?‚Äù

Evangeline was shocked. Her eyes showed pure jealousy. *Lavender was right*. Evangeline didn‚Äôt want to lose someone that she loved so dearly, but she wanted to help Lavender.

‚ÄúWhat I did with my last partner was I took her to dinner, came home to her place, and after that, I told her that I loved her,‚Äù Evangeline smiled, hoping that it would help.

Lavender‚Äôs gratitude showed as she smiled back, knowing that soon, they would be together. She only hoped that her intuition was right.

After that day, Lavender found herself alone. She didn‚Äôt hang out with Evangeline for about a week, then she got the text that she was waiting for

Evangeline: *Hey Lavender, wanna hang out tomorrow?*¬†

Lavender: *Sure. Does dinner work? I‚Äôm busy for most of the day, but I‚Äôm free for the rest of the night!*

Evangeline: *Sure! See you then!*

	Lavender was overjoyed. She was about to have her first ever love confession, but it terrified her. She wanted to be with Evangeline, but she could only hope that she wanted the same.¬†

	As Lavender arrived at Evangeline‚Äôs house, she watched as Evangeline came out of her house in the most stunning dress that Lavender had ever seen. Lavender couldn‚Äôt take her eyes off her, and Evangeline saw her stare as she got into the car.

	‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd think you were in love with me!‚Äù Evangeline let out a nervous laugh.

	‚ÄúI can‚Äôt support my stunning best friend?‚Äù Lavender‚Äôs face grew red.

	As they drove to the restaurant, Lavender and Evangeline laughed, talked, joked, and listened to music. Lavender felt butterflies in her stomach; this was it.¬†

They arrived, and a server led them to sit. Both of them were over twenty-one, so the two of them ordered a bottle of fancy champagne. Lavender wanted it to be special, and it was.¬†

When they finished eating, Lavender confessed it, ‚ÄúEvangeline, ever since I met you, I was drawn to your radiant energy and beauty. When I started hanging out with you more, I knew that I was in love. I tried to push it down, saying that we were just friends, but I can‚Äôt hold it back anymore. I love you, and I hope you feel the same.‚Äù

Evangeline sat there with her mouth open, then she started laughing, ‚ÄúIt took you this long to realize! I love you too Lavender!‚Äù

Then Evangeline sped up to Lavender. Their lips touched, and it was a wonderful feeling.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Evangeline pulled away, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I just did that. I‚Äôm so sorry.

‚ÄúNo don‚Äôt apologize!‚Äù Lavender blushed, ‚ÄúI kinda liked it.‚Äù

Then Lavender pulled Evangeline into another kiss.¬†¬†

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ip2fdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/1ip2fdm/biological_conspiration_theory_fazbear_frights/,Biological Conspiration Theory - Fazbear Frights Biggest Mystery.,"I was taking a re-read to Room For One More for a Post About Sister Location I had planned on releasing, but I found something very interesting...

>The facility was dark and lacked proper ventilation. Because of its underground location, there was always a level of dampness in the air that made Stanley feel clammy. Supposedly, the building was a factory, but even on the inside, it provided no clue as to what kind of work might have been going on there. The building was a network of dim hallways faintly illuminated by sickly greenish lights. Networks of black pipes snaked overhead. Throughout the hallways were giant locked metal doors. Stanley had no idea what went on behind them.  
***Fazbear Frights 3 - 1:35 AM // Room For One More - Page 60***

This single quote called my attention.

Stanley works in an underground facility, a factory, one connected to the SL Bunker as seen with the miniereenas leaving through the vents, so, this is connected to CBEAR, we also know what the Factory does,  *biological stuff*. As soon as I read the mention of biological waste I inmediatly remembered Mr. Little and the Biological Conspiracy Theory, a theory I made a while ago, but, let me explain.

He told me Everything‚Ä¶ This story might seem impossible to be in games timeline because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúworld ending‚Äù situation, but taking a look into what the story shows, this doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case:

>Chris, as the creature would have to learn to call itself, stood over the shapeless mass of empty flesh on the cot. He opened the biohazard bag and stuffed the fleshy remains of the experiment inside of it. He was surprised that he was able to cram all of it into one bag, and when he picked it up, the contents were surprisingly light.  
It left the cubicle and found Mr. Little sitting at his desk drinking from a Styrofoam cup of coffee and munching on a doughnut. ‚ÄúWell, good morning, Chris!‚Äù Mr. Little said, standing up and brushing crumbs from his mustache. ‚ÄúYou had a long night, didn‚Äôt you? But don‚Äôt keep me in suspense. Did you finally complete the experiment? Did you get the results you wanted?‚ÄùThe new Chris‚Äôs eyes were wide and full of wonder. Soon he would be stepping out of the classroom and out of the school and into the world for the first time.Chris handed the biohazard bag to Mr. Little. He looked into the teacher‚Äôs eyes and smiled. ‚ÄúHe told me everything,‚Äù he said.  
As Chris walked outside the school building, the sun was warm on his face. The sky was blue, the clouds were white and fluffy, and birds chirped in the trees. Chris smiled. It was a beautiful day.  
***Fazbear Frights 7 - The Cliffs - Page 114***

So, ‚ÄúThe New Chris‚Äù, you know, the Faz-Goo one, is like a child, a kid wanted to learn, as a newborn but with the abilities of a teen, this doesn‚Äôt seem like an world-ending situation, but as a new beginning of someone‚Äôs life, yes this is dangerous and all, but something to keep in mind is that this isn‚Äôt something that was causing the humanity to fall or trying to constantly kill or replace the humans, instead, it‚Äôs just taking the role of something given to him.

This is very important to the theory because of The Puppet Carver, set in May of the 2000s.

>To get to work, he had to walk through a storage yard stacked high with lumber, concrete blocks, and steel girders. Concealed in the middle of all the building materials was a stairway leading underground. A single low-wattage light bulb illuminated the dark steps just enough for him to find his way down safely. At the bottom of the stairs he had to pass the same stinking biowaste bin he passed every night. It always had the exact same mixture of foul odors‚Äîsomething chemical, something like rotting food, and most disturbingly, something like how he imagined the smell of decaying flesh.  
***Fazbear Frights 3 - 1:35 AM - Page 61***

In the story ‚ÄúRoom For One More‚Äù, to get to his work, Stanley, the protagonist, needs to go through a place that had a lot of ‚Äústinking biowaste‚Äù which smells like decaying flesh.

What could this ‚Äúbiowaste‚Äù be?

Let me bring something else to the theory.

>The supervisor who hired him was a strange little bald man in a too-large suit who fidgeted and seemed to have a hard time meeting Stanley‚Äôs eyes.  
***Fazbear Frights 3 - 1:35 AM - Page 62***

Someone small, who isn‚Äôt good at eye contact and is seemingly energetic‚Ä¶

Before going to who I think this guy is, let me talk a little about someone a little‚Ä¶

Mr. Little is weird, he has some strange connection to the Faz-Goo and is very obviously *not* a normal person, and definitively does some weird illegal things.

>The shelves that lined the room were filled with more scientific curiosities than Chris could take in at once. The one nearest him displayed a variety of glass jars filled with clear fluid and different biological specimens. One jar held some poor creature‚Äôs heart; another housed a fetal piglet with two perfectly formed heads. Yet another contained what looked disturbingly like a human brain.  
***Fazbear Frights 7 - The Cliffs - Page 92***

So, if he has a literal *human brain* on a shelf in a school, biological specimens, a creature heart and a fetal piglet as nothing, what could he do? If he used his class as the subject of the test to test the Faz-Goo, then we start to see the real image of Mr. Little.

>He was a small, energetic man‚Äîthe literal incarnation of his last name‚Äîand he was smiling like the master of ceremonies in a particularly exciting show. His safety goggles, worn over his regular glasses, made his eyes look huge and insectoid.  
***Fazbear Frights 7 - The Cliffs - Page 92***

So, Mr. Little is a small, energetic man huh? *Sounds familiar?* He quite resembles the supervisor of Stanley, and the fact he wears those goggles for the whole story (or at least it's never mentioned him not having them) indicates that he might have something to hide in his eyes‚Ä¶ Also, he gets very defensive when someone calls ‚Äútoy‚Äù the Freddy Fazbear Mad Scientist Kit:

>There were a few chuckles in the class, and one kid said, ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt that kit just a toy?‚Äù‚ÄúIt is most definitely not a toy,‚Äù Mr. Little replied, his voice turning stern suddenly, ‚Äúand if you treat it as one, it will be at your own peril.  
***Fazbear Frights 7 - The Cliffs - Page 103***

And so, if Mr. Little is so connected to the Faz-Goo, if Mr. Little is Stanley‚Äôs Supervisor, if Mr. Little is the one behind the Faz-Goo infection‚Ä¶ Then we still have a lot of questions:

* What is Mr. Little 's goal?
* What about the biowaste on RFOM?
* What about the Faz-Goo attacking Jack directly from ‚ÄúThe Puppet Carver‚Äù?
* Is there another experiment like the Faz-Goo?
* How does the Faz-Goo work exactly?
* How does Fazbear and Afton connect to all of this?

Well, I got an answer to all of those questions!

Starting with the most intriguing one‚Ä¶ How does Afton and Fazbear connect to the Faz-Goo? Remember that the Faz-Goo is out of a **Freddy Fazbear** Mad Scientist Kit.

So, how does it connect? And why is there‚Äô ‚Äúbiowaste‚Äù outside of Circus Baby Entertainment and Rentals? Well‚Ä¶ The Answer might be more simple but complicated than you think‚Ä¶

William Afton was the CEO of Fazbear Entertainment in the 80s, remember? Well, if Mr. Little made an agreement with Afton? In that case then William could‚Äôve made the Faz-Goo an actual part of the brand! Just like we see in He Told Me Everything! This would explain the biowaste, it could be the biological waste that was left over the Faz-Goo! But what about the smell? Well, what if it is one of the victims of the Faz-Goo?

But why would Afton accept this deal? How could it help him? Well‚Ä¶ It could be because of how the Faz-Goo works!

Let‚Äôs take a look at both apparitions of the Faz-Goo‚Ä¶¬†

In the first one (He Told Me Everything), it‚Äôs like a kid wanting to learn, but, there‚Äôs something off, it says to Mr. Little ‚ÄúHe told me Everything‚Äù, why?¬† Why would it say that when in most cases it wouldn‚Äôt say anything because the person it's replacing was sleeping? Another weird detail is how the person doesn‚Äôt seem to feel pain while it‚Äôs being replaced‚Ä¶ As there are no screams until you realize you‚Äôre being sucked, so, why?

Well, here‚Äôs when the second appearance makes things clearer.

In The Puppet Carver, The Faz-Goo completely replaces Jack and keeps his memories but without the agony and anger‚Ä¶ Which is very strange, then we got this:

>The creature kept looking at him. Then, slowly, it raised one arm and reached toward him. Like elastic, its arm stretched, growing thinner as it reached across the length of the desk to touch Jack‚Äôs face.Pain like Jack had never known shot through him. But it wasn‚Äôt physical pain. He felt the pain of hurt, neglect, abuse. It was the pain of every employee he had ever yelled at or fired, the pain of his son every time he had missed one of his ball games or unfairly criticized him, the pain of his wife for every forgotten birthday or unkind word. Jack was filled with all the emotional pain he had ever caused, and it was more intense than he could bear. He doubled over and squeezed his tear-filled eyes shut, sure he was about to die from a real broken heart.But then the pain left him just as suddenly as it had come, and he was awash in an overwhelming sense of relief. When he opened his eyes, the creature was gone.  
***Fazbear Frights 9 - The Puppet Carver - Page 34***

So, the Faz-Goo straight up took all his emotional pain and everything, but there‚Äôs something off with that Faz-Goo entity:

>The thing had approximations of arms and legs and a lumpy mound that stood in for a head. It was made of the translucent pink goo, under which its organs were visible. Somehow it reminded Jack of the awful gelatin salad his mom used to make, with canned fruit suspended under the slimy surface. It had no mouth or nose, but it had eyes. Dark eyes that stared at Jack as though the thing could see into him the way he could see into it.  
***Fazbear Frights 9 - The Puppet Carver - Page 34***

Its as if it wasn‚Äôt an normal entity, but something that was in mid-transformation, it had organs, which is interesting as in the end of the story we‚Äôre told this:

>Was that a kidney or a piece of a liver? Not the organs of a rat, but of a much larger creature. Human-size.  
***Fazbear Frights 9 - The Puppet Carver - Page 44***

This is very intriguing, this indicates that Jack almost die in the Puppet Carver, but maybe because of the Faz-Goo, the machine failed in a first place, and when Jack left all his agony was gone because of the Faz-Goo changing places with Jack, until Jack left as a new person, but it was followed by the Faz-Goo because of the fact it needed to end what it had started, fully switching places!

This would explain the development of the story and why Jack was attacked by it!

I‚Äôll later explain how it ended up there, but the point is, the Faz-Goo is capable of taking the role of someone and remove all his agony, be someone new, this would explain alone the why Mr. Little used it on his students, to have them be better, new, this is further proven because of how both Chris and Jack are both bad people, but after they were replaced, they became new and happy people, this would explain it all!

Mr. Little made it to get rid of the agony, William would want this, why? Because he experiments with Agony! What are the things that the Faz-Goo leaves? Well, what if that‚Äôs some sort of representation of Agony? This would actually explain a lot and answer almost all the questions, the only questions left are‚Ä¶

* How did the Faz-Goo end up in the Puppet Carver?
* Is there another experiment like the Faz-Goo?

How the Faz-Goo ends up in the Puppet Carver is a mystery that isn‚Äôt clear at all, there‚Äôs basically no-information of how it got there in the first place! I can give 2 answers but they have poor to less than nothing proofs:

* Mr. Little himself (no proof)
* The Faz-Goo itself moved there (huh?)
* A rat (poor proof)

The most likely is that the Faz-Goo itself arrived there by accident. Thanks to how Jack is followed by the Faz-Goo creature we know that Faz-Goo entities can move and act by themselves and so, it could‚Äôve easily arrived there prior to the events of the Friday, remember it was left in the Pizza Playground for the whole night, and so, it wouldn‚Äôt be far-fetched to think it would‚Äôve moved there by itself.

Yet the motives are unknown, maybe it arrived because of a rat or because of someone in an accident.

So, Stanley wouldn't be supervising if any animatronic got out, he'd be supervising for any *experiment* from leaving.

The fact that the Miniereenas act exactly like they do in Night 4 SL, trying to get into a person, this makes me believe that there's a connection between the two. I mean whenever is RFOM set, it's at earliest 2 years after CBEAR had the Funtimes.

Now, here's when I should mention, after the events of Sister Location, the place didn't shut down, as seen in Dittophobia, Funtime Foxy was changed to being a pirate fox, Balloora was rearmed. And, as seen in Help Wanted Vent Repair: Ennard. So, if the designs are directly the same ones of SL, this means that it's set before SL.

This does actually solve how did the FazGoo sample even got remotely close to The Puppet Carver, because of it escaping Fazbear's Bio-Factory, they can move by themselves! This was literally seen in The Puppet Carver itself! *THAT'S* the thing that Mr. Little was trying to prevent.

EVIDENCE COLLECTION:

* Mr. Little has a weird connection to FazGoo.
* Fazbear Entertainment is connected in a way to FazGoo.
* FazGoo doesn't kill people, it takes over their bodies yes, but they directly lose all sight of agony, pain, anger and they even keep their memories!
* Mr. Little's description matches Stanley's Supervisor.
* Stanley Works in a underground Facility, a Factory where Biological waste is produced.
* The Factory is connected to CBEAR.
* Stanley dreams with the Funtimes of SL instead of the ones of Dittophobia.

So yeah, I believe that RFOM is set before SL but is not necesarily set after CBPW reopened (because it did).

But either way, this makes clear a timeline of events for FazGoo.

1980s

* The Circus Baby's Pizza World Bunker is created
* Fazbear Entertainment & Mr. Little start working together, specifically, William and Little. Mr. Little's idea was using his scientific ideas and investigations with the founds of Fazbear Entertainment to make a substance that could get rid of any negative emotion.
* William, supporting this idea, creates a factory for this, directly connected to the Circus Baby's Pizza World Bunker, because this idea suited him, experimenting on emotions was already a thing he had started doing with the Nightmare Chambers, so this was even better for investigating them.
* Mr. Little becomes the Supervisor of the Bio-Factory of Fazbear Entertainment.

1990s

* Fazbear Frights - Room For One More

2000s

* A Sample of FazGoo manages to escape Fazbear's Bio-Factory.
* Fazbear Frights - The Puppet Carver

2000s-2035

* Mr. Little abandons the Factory and becomes a teacher at Hurricane's High School, becoming the leader of the Science Club.

1ip2fa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ip2fa9/what_would_you_do_if_you_were_me_struggling_in/,What would you do if you were me? (Struggling in the mental health field.),"TW: mentions of suicidal ideation, depression, etc.

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm basically at my wit‚Äôs end and would like some advice or insight into what I can do to help myself ASAP and in the long run. I am currently on vacation and it has become abundantly clear to me that change in my life‚Äôs trajectory is no longer a deep desire of mine but a serious necessity.

Context on me/my mental health: I am a woman living in upstate NY. I am 26, turning 27 soon. I live alone (don‚Äôt have to pay rent because I am living in/taking care of a family member‚Äôs home), am partnered long-term, and I have no children. I struggle with my mental health. I am neurodivergent (I have ADHD, which I only realized in recent years) and have struggled with anxiety for basically as long as I can remember, as well as severe depression since roughly 2011. I am medicated (currently taking Adderall, Wellbutrin, and Abilify) and have been seeing the same therapist since the summer of 2019.

My work: I work in the mental health field and have been in my current position working as a residential counselor in a community residence (‚Äúgroup home‚Äù) for the last six months. I was also in college full-time from when I returned to school in September 2022 until this month when I switched to part-time study because I couldn‚Äôt handle working FT and doing school FT again. (Prior to taking on my current job, I was the primary caregiver for a family member with dementia for about a year and a half before they went into a nursing home last summer, so there‚Äôs a year and a half gap in my employment for that timeframe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also done a lot of job hopping in the past due to severe/persistent mental health struggles, but I feel I have curated my resum√© well enough for mental health/human services/social work roles)

My schooling: I completed my A.A. in General Studies in December 2023 and have been working on finishing my B.A. in Social Science since. I‚Äôve been planning to pursue graduate studies and earn my M.S.W. (Master‚Äôs in Social Work).

The current issue: I am completely burnt out between work and school. I also literally cannot separate my work life from my personal life. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ the same life. I don‚Äôt mean to imply that I work all the time, but that I cannot stop thinking about work almost ever. At my job, I‚Äôve realized I feel like I‚Äôm constantly in limbo waiting for something bad to happen, though most days are usually quite relaxed. I think simply knowing that something could happen from past experiences is anxiety-inducing enough. I am also in the habit of self-sabotaging and pushing things (important tasks that are key responsibilities of my job) off because of anxiety. I‚Äôve also realized I am doing this (putting myself in time crunches, etc.) because I want something to break. I got into the habit of overcommitting and underperforming, or at least not performing as well as I could ‚Äî I haven‚Äôt gotten in trouble at work or anything, to be clear‚Ä¶ but still‚Ä¶ I hope I make sense. Basically, I feel I need to leave my job because it is too stressful and has been triggering for me. Again, I always feel I‚Äôm waiting in limbo for something to go wrong or a crisis to arise. I also do one overnight a week at work and it is extremely stressful for me (I‚Äôm typically crying weekly when that day comes) as I am barely able to sleep and generally just feel uneasy. I also have a semi-new supervisor who is very micromanage-y which only complicates my feelings and perception of my job further.

If it is not obvious, I am in a very vulnerable state right now and I recognize this ‚Äî I have been experiencing suicidal ideation which hasn‚Äôt happened in quite some time, so I know it‚Äôs actually bad. I just want opinions on what I should do soon to help myself job-wise in the immediate future and in the long-run career-wise.

Considerations when leaving my current job: I have health insurance through my job and I am worried about what will happen if I lose it. I know I‚Äôd likely qualify for Medicaid again, but I don‚Äôt want this to be some big issue come tax time next year.

Considerations for a new job/pursuit: I need something that will allow me to focus on school above anything. I am thinking I will try to apply to work in a coffee shop or bakery. I am good at customer service, but it is draining. I am also a licensed esthetician, but I‚Äôm not interested in pursuing anything in the esthetics field at this point, really.

Things I know I‚Äôm interested in: antiques/vintage, learning, talking, writing, art (though I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself an ‚Äúartist‚Äù). Ideally, I think I would like to operate a vintage/antique shop, but I don‚Äôt think I have the discipline or capacity to hold myself accountable and regularly put in the effort needed to create and sustain a successful business. I‚Äôve also been interested in content creation for 15+ years, but I don‚Äôt see myself as a successful ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù because I don‚Äôt want to sell people things‚Ä¶ maybe I could make my niche vintage stuff if I did pursue content creation at all.

If I stay at my current workplace: there is the possibility of going to relief staff which is ~$2.25 less per hour and I would lose health insurance. I‚Äôd also still have the 50 minute commute (one-way, so roughly 2 hours roundtrip) which sucks.

TL;DR: I am a mid-to-late 20‚Äôs college student working in the mental health/social work field with intentions of completing my M.S.W. after I finish my B.A. which I am about 70% done with. Despite my considerable experience with mental health struggles/trauma and my desire to alleviate the struggles of others and prevent/reduce trauma for them, I don‚Äôt feel I can actually handle a career in the social work/human services/mental health field ‚Äî at least not at present, given how persistently mentally unwell/burnt out/overwhelmed I am and have been for many years.

Supposedly, it was authored by a disciple of Rabbi Chaim Vital in the16th century. 

My reasons for doubting this are as follows:

- It refers to the '◊ó◊õ◊û◊ô ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊î◊ê◊û◊ô◊™◊ô◊ô◊ù'. I didn't think that expression was in vogue before Rav Kook and Rav Soloveitchik came around, am I right? Seems like exactly the sort of expression that 21st century supporters of the ban would use to explain why everyone must follow Rav Elyashiv's opinion and to discredit the MO rabbis, thus its appearance being rather fortuitous for Slifkin, and overall seems out of place in the 16th century.


- The sefer repeatedly refers to religious Jews as ◊ì◊™◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ó◊®◊ì◊ô◊ô◊ù. As far as I know, these words usually appear only in modern Hebrew (note the spelling with two yuds- never seen that before the 20th century, except maybe in philosophical writings- certainly not common), and the second was at the time not yet used at all to refer to religious Jews as a distinct group.  


- The whole sefer has a very yeshivish vibe to it. It's like a literal gift to Slifkin from Heaven, he expresses himself exactly like a bad caricature of a guy in the coffee room in BMG. 'How could someone ignore the wisdom of the holy Gedolim and listen to a lowly, gashmiyusdike goy?!?!' *(Shriek shriek bangs head on table flaps arms wildly.)* Point is, it all seems to good to be true.

There's also no shaar blatt, but that's probably just because this was purportedly printed as an appendix to a larger sefer.

Planning your moms funeral is the hardest and complicated thing I've ever had to do in my life. Trying to talk about where I want to lay my mom to rest, while I'm trying not to turn red from hyperventilating cries. But even the funeral wasn't safe, People were spreading rumors that my dad killed her and I refused to look at her before the funeral ( I didn't want to see my mom in a casket ) But, I had to. I wobbled from my ankles and fell to my knees when I saw her. She looked fake to me. I had to be carried out until I was calm to re enter.

I paused school and my job and I rot in my bed for weeks. Only leaving to get a coffee or have enough strength to make something for dinner. In the same kitchen that felt like it hasn't moved since her death. My birthday was awful, not having her kiss me to wake me up and make me breakfast. Not having her at my birthday. Not having her on christmas ( her favorite holiday ). I get so sick. 

Me and my dad were homeless. Not being able to afford the home anymore. Though I'm glad to be gone from a house that caused me so much pain, I felt like I was leaving her behind all alone in the house. 

I'm back in school again and struggling to find a job. I try my best to make my mom happy in some way ( small victories here and there ) but sometimes, I just want to stop. I want to drop everything and just lay in my bed like I used to. I haven't moved on, I'm not able to afford therapy, It feels like I've had an open wound on my heart for a year now.
