After Sinclair’s announcement to the nurses, an entire month went by. And in that amount of time, 14 patients committed suicide. And as a result, 14 nurses were consumed by Sinclair’s shadow. My already busy schedule ballooned completely as I had to take on more work to cover the patients left behind by the eaten nurses. I finished every day exhausted and drained. It felt like as soon my head touched my pillow it was already time to begin my shift. 



But despite the hellish month, there was one bright spot. And that was Todd. No matter how busy I was, I delivered him food and sat with him when our outside times matched up. We would joke with each other and he would keep me updated on certain patients that were the most likely next to commit suicide. He also continued to get me small gifts. More scrunchies, cute little stickers I could use to cheer myself up, and even one time an energy drink. 



“How do you even get this stuff?” I asked him one day as we sat together on the benches in the garden. Other patients milled about, a few new ones had been brought in and they were still going through detox. The heroin addicts especially needed my attention since they could barely function while going through their withdrawals. It was one situation in which the strange black pills that Sombra use are actually useful. Only taking one a day is more than enough to combat the symptoms of withdrawal and detox. Any more than one a day and you risked turning into a husk. 



“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Todd answered me, nudging my shoulder with his and giving a little giggle as he sat back on the bench. I pouted at his vague answer but I supposed that he was entitled to some secrets. 



“Well, thank you regardless. Without you, I don’t think I could get through a day of working here.” I sighed. I felt exhausted and completely drained. Being a nurse is already not an easy job. Coupled with these working conditions? And I was starting to feel as tired as Sinclair looked. 



“I’m sure you would. You’re a tough girl, Red,” he said as he fiddled around with his empty juice box. “I bet you could 1v1 Nurse Whore and win.” He giggled again and I joined him. It certainly would be cathartic to beat the absolute shit out of Nurse Taylor. If I could I’d grab one of the metal trays we serve the food on and smack her across the face with it. 



“If that ever happens, I’ll be sure to do it in front of your room. Get you some entertainment.” I smiled at him. I looked down at my watch and sighed. It was already time to get back to my shift. I looked over at Todd and noticed that he was busy looking off into space. In the moment I leaned in and kissed him on the cheek. 



“Wha-?” He turned his face quickly to look at me. His pale gaunt face went red with embarrassment and I couldn’t help but smile and this time, peck him on the lips. It was only a quick one, but it felt like I was instantly reignited.



“As thanks for keeping me sane.” I quickly stood up and shuffled away. My face felt like it was on fire and I was sure that it was probably as red as Todd’s had been. I spared a glance back at him and he had his face hidden behind his hands and I could hear soft groaning coming from behind them. I smiled again and quickly dipped inside of Sombra. And returned to my duty as a nurse. 



As I went about my duties of making the beds and administering medicine, in a much kinder way than Nurse Taylor had shown me, I was walking down one of Sombra’s millions of hallways when I suddenly caught the whiff of smoke. For a quick second, I thought that maybe there was a fire somewhere. As I walked down the hall in search of the source, I heard voices. One of them was undoubtedly Sinclair. I quickly slammed myself against the wall and carefully tiptoed my way closer to the room that he was in. 



“How can you smoke this?” An unknown voice asked. It sounded, hollow and empty. I got close enough to be by the door, and against my better judgment I carefully stuck my head into the room. It was a vacant patient’s room and in there, smoking cigars, was Sinclair and Spencer. “It feels like I’m smoking a campfire log,” Spencer complained as he smoked one of Sinclair’s cigars. 



“I assure you, it’s far better than those noxious cigarettes you smoke.” Sinclair was sitting in a chair against the wall, enjoying his cigar. Spencer had his back to me with his hood down and puffs of smoke emerging from him as he sputtered and coughed. 



“At least mine can taste like mint.” Spencer huffed as he took a few more puffs of the cigar. He took a seat on the bed and as he turned to do so I quickly had to cover my mouth and pull my head back out into the hallway. 



Spener’s entire lower face had no skin or muscles to speak of. And the hand that was holding the cigar up to his face was completely devoid of skin as well. He was almost completely skeletal. And yet, he was completely fine. He was talking, smoking, and seemed to not have a care in the world. 



“So, how is the project I asked you to work on?” Sinclair asked. This got my attention, and despite how freaky Spencer looked, my curiosity pulled my head back to peek into their room. “I didn’t just call you here to smoke with me and inject my patients with more of your drugs.” Sinclair exhaled smoke from his nose and waited for Spencer to answer. The partially skeletonized man gave up on his cigar and crushed it against the stone walls of the room. 



“Well, I can be ready for an actual test in a few days. The samples you provided me with decay incredibly quickly so I’ll require more if we are to do an actual test.” Spencer explained, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a box of cigarettes. 



“It won’t be easy. Its already annoyed that we’re even doing these tests, to begin with. Feels like I’m going to replace it.” Sinclair sighed, leaning back against the chair and suddenly taking notice of me. “What do you want, woman?” He scared me by how suddenly he saw me spying on him. 



Caught completely off guard I had to make up the most convincing lie I could think of. “Nurse Taylor sent me to see if there’s anything you might need, sir.” I held my breath waiting for his response. And whether or not I was about to be consumed by his shadow. But to my relief, he just let out an annoyed sigh and waved me away, 



“We don’t need anything. Go and try to make yourself useful somewhere else.” I nodded, quickly. I looked over to Spencer to see if he would react in any way to my seeing him like this. But he simply nodded at me and went back to smacking his box of cigarettes against his skeleton hand. I made sure not to stay my welcome and quickly went about my business, with Sinclair’s words in the back of my head as I walked away. 



The rest of my day was uneventful, besides breaking up a fight in the rec room over a stolen jigsaw puzzle piece. After the two were separated and the puzzle piece was returned, I was finally allowed to clock out for the day and return to my room. As I scanned my ID to enter the employee-only section and began walking past the kitchen area, I heard a few nurses gossiping about Spencer as I walked passed them. 



“I swear, every time he comes to visit, this place just gets so much worse.” One of the older nurses shook her head and nursed her cup of black coffee. “I remember the first time Mr. Sinclair brought him here. That was when the pills showed up, and the patients started turning into Zombies.” She sighed and shook her head. 



So I wasn’t just standing there awkwardly, I decided to enter the kitchen area and just went to the vending machine. Pretending like I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop on the conversation going on just a few feet away from me. 



“I swear I saw him injecting one of my patients with a syringe. Next day? The whole room was quarantined. When I asked Mr. Sinclair about it? I was told to mind my own business and get back to work.” Another nurse tsked and finished the microwaved meal she had been eating. I made sure to pretend like I was trying to decide what I wanted to get from the vending machine. 



“If this keeps up, I don’t know how much longer I can keep my sanity here,” The first nurse said again, her hands visibly shaking as she struggled to hold her mug to her mouth. Before any other nurse could speak up, they all quickly shot at attention when the door to the employee-only section opened and Nurse Taylor entered with a scowl. 



“What the fuck are you all doing standing around?! Do you want another one of us to get eaten?! Go do your jobs! NOW!!!” She screamed, and all of the nurses quickly tossed their dishes in the sink and their uneaten food in the trash before shuffling away and out into Sombra’s halls. “You! Didn’t you hear-” She started to yell at me before she noticed who I was. “Oh, Cassie! I’m so sorry you just finished your shift didn’t you?” 



“Y-yes ma’am.” I nodded, quickly just ordering a chocolate bar and waiting for the machine to spit it out for me. Taylor nodded and I noticed just how disheveled she looked. It seemed as if she also wasn’t exempt from the rules Sinclair had in place. The vending machine finally finished dispensing my chocolate bar and I quickly bent down to pick it up.



“You know, Cassie? Word is you’ve grown quite attached to a patient.” My body tensed up as I grabbed the chocolate bar and nearly crushed it. I looked over at her and saw that she had the biggest shit-eating grin I’ve ever seen. 



“Me? No ma’am. I’m just doing my job. That’s all,” I told her, quickly taking the chocolate bar and walking over to her. She blocked my way from exiting and looked at me for a good long while. I stared back at her and did my best to keep my face as neutral as possible. 



“Hmm, must just be some gossip. You know how we nurses are,” she said with a smile, patting me on the head and exiting back out into the hallways of Sombra. I released a breath I didn’t even know I was holding in, before quickly running to my room and slamming the door behind me. 



As I slammed my back against my door and slid down to the floor, I heard a sudden shriek. Looking around quickly, thinking that maybe I had rushed into the wrong room, I saw that nobody was there. That was until I lowered my eyes to the floor and noticed a yellow stick note on the ground. Sitting there with a crayon, was a small bug-like creature. It was no more than five inches tall and had on a little hoodie and little sweatpants. It looked almost like a little toy doll. 



“Uh…hi?” I told it, completely confused as to how this thing had entered my room and what it was doing. It suddenly burst into tears. Now that completely shocked me, and I quickly looked away from it, trying to find something in my room that might appease it. As I did so, my eyes fell upon my mirror with the doodler’s drawings sticking to it. It suddenly clicked in my head. 



“Are you…the doodler?” I asked it, hoping that it understood me. The only answer I got was more crying when I stared at it, and a sudden hiss from it. It spitted at me, but the spit barely traveled past the sticky note it was drawing on before landing on the floor and releasing a sizzle once it did land. 



“Is…that a yes?” I asked it, only to get it crying more, the more I looked at it. It was almost like it didn’t like being perceived. Taking the hint I covered my face and eyes with my hands. The crying suddenly stopped. And I heard what sounded like a crayon scribbling. After a few more moments I heard what sounded like a fly buzzing. I moved my hands away just in time to see the doodler fly away with its crayon and over to a crack in my wall, before quickly scurrying into it and disappearing. 



“So it’s…a doodlebug?” I asked myself, as I walked over and picked up the sticky note that the doodlebug had left for me. It sent a chill down my spine as I stared at it. It was a figure scratched into the sticky note. It almost resembled the doodle that it did for Sinclair’s shadow. I went over and grabbed that doodle off of my mirror and compared the two. Immediately it was evident that it was two different creatures. 



“I have to show Todd this.” I quickly stuck the two notes into my pocket and left my room. Walking down the halls toward Todd’s room, my head was spinning with so many questions. What was Sinclair’s goal here? What was Spencer’s role? What the hell was that doodlebug? All these questions were in my head as I knocked on Todd’s door and waited for him. 



He opened the door and immediately I could tell he was excited to see me. I quickly entered his room and he closed the door behind him. “You will not believe what I just saw,” I started to tell him before he suddenly presented me with a small red rose. 



“It reminds me of your hair.” He said awkwardly as he handed the rose over to me. I stared at it for a second before accepting the rose from him. “I hope you like it. It cost me a whole pack of cigarettes.” He chuckled trying to play it off, but I could tell he was shy and awkward. 



“Thank you so much, Todd.” I smiled, held the rose to my nose, and took a small sniff of it. It didn’t smell like much, but in this muted and corporate atmosphere, this small rose meant so much to me. I looked up at him with a smile, before I dropped the rose to the floor and felt my heart drop. Constantine Sinclair was standing behind him, with his shadow hanging over his shoulder and smiling at me. 



“Oh, Todd! It’s time for your treatment! You’ve been selected for a groundbreaking new procedure!” Nurse Taylor said as she opened the door to Todd’s room. Todd quickly looked back behind him to see what I had been staring at, and then over toward Taylor. He was about to run for it when Sinclair’s shadow reached out and grabbed him by the throat. 



“N-no!” I screamed out, reaching towards Todd. Sinclair stared daggers at me and sneered at me like I was a cockroach. “Let him go!” I shouted at Sinclair, running at him and getting ready to tear him to shreds before I was grabbed from behind by two orderlies who had followed Nurse Taylor into the room. 



“I knew you had something for a patient. But to think that it was Todd, of all people?” Taylor giggled, obviously enjoying both of our sufferings. Todd struggled against Sinclair’s shadow, but any time he tried to grab its arm and pry it off his throat his hands just slipped off of the goopy creature. 



“Nurse Cassandra. I don’t believe that I have to remind you that, nurses and patients are prohibited from being in a relationship.” Sinclair scolded me. He sighed in annoyance and rubbed his tired eyes. “I suppose I’ll have to make an example out of the two of you.” He lowered his hand and stared at me. “Release her and take him,” he ordered. His shadow gurgled and tossed Todd to the floor. Before he could stand back up, he was grabbed by the orderlies after they had let go of me. 



Before I could say or do anything, Nurse Taylor quickly walked over and motioned for me to follow as Todd was dragged out of his room kicking and shouting. “I’d recommend you come quietly. Mr. Sinclair’s patience is already razor-thin as it is.” She smiled and grabbed me by my wrist. I quickly yanked my hand away from her and went to smack her. Before I could though she punched me in the stomach, sending me to the floor and gagging. 



“Both of you. Leave your stupid womanly conflicts till after the procedure,” Sinclair ordered, causing Taylor to quickly stand at attention and nod at him. I gagged a few more times and coughed before standing up and weakly following after the duo. Todd kicked and screamed more as he was carried by the orderlies down the halls and toward the therapy room. 



I hoped that it would only be another round of electro-shock therapy. As painful as it would be, Todd could handle that. But as we entered the therapy room, I was horrified to find Spencer sitting on the table waiting for us. 



“About time. I was about to take a nap.” Spencer leaped off the table and dusted it off. The orderlies carried Todd to the table and quickly tied him down to it. He continued to thrash around and shout every swear he knew at them. “I can’t exactly do my job if he’s acting like this.” Spencer pulled his face mask back over his bony lower face and looked over at us. 



“Nurse Cassandra. You’ll hold the patient down. As punishment for breaking your contract, you’ll have to see what happens firsthand.” Sinclair ordered, his shadow peeking over his shoulder and staring at me with its bright white eyes. I looked over at Todd and wanted nothing more than to take his place on that table. “I am not going to ask you twice, woman.” I looked at Sinclair again, before walking over to Todd and holding his arms down on the table. 



“I’m so sorry…” I told him as I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I held him down, and he looked up at me with terror in his eyes. I had to look away from him so that I didn’t burst into tears right then and there. 



“Get on with it.” Sinclair crossed his arms as he looked over at Taylor and Spencer. The two nodded and Taylor also donned her face mask to cover her mouth. She walked to a nearby prep station, washed her hands thoroughly, and walked back over with a scalpel in her hand. 



“Orderlies? Assist Nurse Cassandra,” she ordered, the mute orderlies nodding and taking my place by holding Todd’s arms down. “Would you be so kind as to hold his head still, Cassie?” she asked me. I looked down at Todd and instantly got a horrible feeling in my heart. 



“W-what about anesthesia?” I asked feebly, to which she giggled underneath her mask, and motioned with her scalpel for me to get on with it. I looked down at Todd and he looked up at me. His eyes were filled with terror and tears began to well in his eyes as well. I grabbed his head and softly rubbed his cheeks before holding it still. 



“There’s a good girl,” Taylor said as she approached me turned her scalpel down to Todd’s head, and sliced a deep cut into his forehead. Todd thrashed and screamed and I had to do my best to hold his head still. Both to comply with my orders and to hopefully stop him from getting more hurt. “Spencer? Saw, please.” She looked over at Spencer, who quickly produced a bone saw for her. 



“C-Cassie…please help…” Todd cried out as Taylor whirred the saw to life. I had to shut my eyes and squeeze his head as Taylor cut into his skull. The fact Todd didn’t pass out from the pain alone is extraordinary, but I truly wish that he could’ve. After Taylor had cut into his skull, she removed the bone fragments, and I opened my eyes to see that a section of Todd’s brain was exposed. 



“Alrighty, I’m up.” Spencer declared. Reaching into his hoodie pocket and producing a syringe with a deep black liquid swirling around inside of it. Spencer leaned down and stuck the needle into Todd’s brain, before pressing down on the plunger and injecting Todd with it. I had let Todd’s head go and was now back to holding his arms at the orderlies backed away.



“Cassie…help…” Todd choked out as he cried uncontrollably. As he did so his tears began to change into black goop like liquid. The same that Sinclair’s shadow was made out of. As soon as Spencer had injected the entire syringe, Todd let out an agonizing scream as more of the liquid began to leak out of his eyes and now out of his mouth. He thrashed around and screamed as his body began to twist and crack. 



“That doesn’t seem normal.” Spencer backed up from Todd and put some distance between the two of them. Todd screamed in agony and I watched in horror as his hands began to twist and contort, his bones breaking and snapping as claws began to grow from his fingers. 



“RED…PLEASE!!!” Spencer screamed as his face began to turn black and his teeth began to fall out of his mouth, replaced by four long canines that descended from his face. I watched in horror and began to cry uncontrollably as I watched the only friend I had in Sombra begin to change before my eyes. 



“I’m so sorry Todd…” I cried out, tears flowing uncontrolled as I continued to hold Todd’s arms down. As I continued crying I suddenly felt a hard smack across my face. A smack so hard that it sent my glasses flying off of my face and towards God knows where. Letting go of Todd’s arms I held my stinging cheek and looked over at the culprit. 



“Stop your crying you stupid bitch,” Sinclair ordered of me. His shadow was staring at the whole spectacle with nothing but glee in its bright white eyes. Todd continued to thrash on the table as the blackness spread across his body, twisting and contorting him. It stretched his body out and broke countless bones. He thrashed so violently that the restraint holding him down to the table snapped off and he was able to roll off the table and land on the floor. 



“R…E…D.” He coughed out as he rolled around on the floor, screeching as large spikes emerged from his back, his arms breaking and growing longer. His face was completely swallowed by the black goop and now…he resembled Sinclair’s shadow. But he was far more terrifying. Even Nurse Taylor began to back up from Todd as he started to stand back up. Todd had gone from about 6 feet tall to almost 8 feet tall. But as he tried to stand straight up his spine snapped in the middle and forced him back down on all fours. 



“Todd…” I whimpered as I stared at the horrible creature he had become. It was like something from my worst nightmare, and here he was in front of me. The creature that was once Todd panted softly, gurgling like it was drowning with water in its lungs. It tried to take a few steps forward only for its legs to snap off at the ankles and remain where they were. But as it put them back on the floor, they simply regrew back. 



“Much less than ideal, I’m afraid. It doesn’t seem to have retained any intelligence.” Sinclair sighed as he reached into his suit pocket and pulled out a cigar from it. “I suppose we can run some tests on it.” He shrugged, placing the cigar in his mouth and his shadow quickly produced a match to light it. 



“R…E…D.” The Todd creature gurgled out, before letting out a loud screech and reaching out to bite the head off of one of the orderlies. I let out a scream as tears still streamed down my face. I backed away from the Todd creature as it devoured the orderlies completely. 



“Uh…Mr. Sinclair, sir? I-I believe we have…” Nurse Taylor couldn’t even finish her sentence before the Todd creature screeched out and sprinted towards the doors. The first few hiccups it had with walking were quickly forgotten as it ran as gracefully as a horse would. “A code red!” Taylor screamed as the Todd creature busted the door down and screeched out into the hallway. 



“I think we might need to run more tests.” Spencer shrugged as he scratched his brown hair in confusion over what had gone wrong. I dropped to my knees and stared down at the trail of black tar that Todd had left behind. 



“Todd…” Was all I managed to cry out as I heard him screeching and beginning to run rampage down the halls of Sombra. There was no telling what would happen now. And as I watched him rampage through the halls of Sombra, I couldn’t help but remember the drawing that the doodlebug had given me. Because Todd now looked exactly like it.

We have plans to visit, but not much money to work with in order to do so. Unless we can find someone to stay with, we'll likely only get a few days. So, I'd like to narrow down my options as much as possible before then.

Both of us are trans, leftist, and working artists. Local art markets are a plus, but as we both work independently we don't have a set location for jobs. In general, having an art community to connect with others our fields is the most important thing.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Queer community. Bonus points if there's a big trans community
- Art/Indie film scene. 
- Walkable/Good public transit. Neither of us own a car and do not plan to.
- AFFORDABLE. This is the snag with most places we've looked at. Low cost of living is a must.

WANTS:
- Somewhere that skews younger.
- Access to movie theaters through public transit.
- Coffee shops, record stores, thrifting.
- Local music acts.
- A place where you can be social without drinking.

At this point, we're pretty torn between Logan Square and Rogers Park. I love the artsy hipster vibe and access to the blue line in Logan, but I'm worried about cost of living. I'm being priced out of my current city due to very rapid gentrification and would like to avoid a repeat of that. Rogers Park seems more on the sleepy & family-oriented side, but is a lot less risky price-wise.

Thoughts? How would you compare the two, and are there any alternatives you'd recommend instead? Any particular areas that might fit what we're looking for? ",1,1734385984.0,AskChicago,9,0.57,False

# Introduction

Picture this: You're rushing through your morning routine, gulping down coffee, scrolling through your phone, and multitasking like a pro. Sound familiar? We've all been there. But have you ever stopped to think about how these everyday habits might be affecting your brain?

Our brains are incredible organs, capable of amazing feats. But just like any other part of our body, they need proper care to function at their best. The trouble is, many of us are unknowingly engaging in habits that can harm our cognitive function.

That's why we're here today. We're going to explore 15 common habits that might be damaging your brain. Don't worry, though – this isn't about making you feel bad. It's about empowering you with knowledge so you can make better choices for your brain health.

By the end of this article, you'll have a clear understanding of these habits and, more importantly, practical strategies to replace them with brain-boosting alternatives. Ready to give your brain some love? Let's dive in!

# 1. Neglecting Sleep

# The Sleep-Deprived Brain

Let's start with something we all need but often shortchange: sleep. You've probably heard that adults need about 7-9 hours of sleep per night. But how many of us actually get that much?

Here's the thing: your brain isn't just resting when you sleep. It's actually hard at work, consolidating memories, clearing out toxins, and preparing for the next day. When you skimp on sleep, you're robbing your brain of this crucial maintenance time.

Think of it like this: imagine if you never turned off your computer and just kept running programs 24/7. Eventually, it would slow down, start making mistakes, and might even crash. Your brain works in a similar way.

# Sleep Myths Busted

Now, let's bust some common sleep myths:

1. **""I can catch up on sleep on the weekends.""** \- While you can pay back some sleep debt, chronic sleep deprivation can't be fixed with a few lie-ins. 
2. **""I function fine on 5 hours of sleep.""** \- You might think you're doing okay, but studies show that people who regularly sleep less than 7 hours have impaired cognitive function, even if they don't feel tired. 
3. **""Watching TV helps me fall asleep.""** \- The blue light from screens can actually interfere with your sleep cycle, making it harder to fall asleep and reducing sleep quality. 

# Better Sleep Habits

So, how can you improve your sleep habits? Here are some strategies:

1. **Stick to a schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. 
2. **Create a bedtime routine:** This could include reading a book, taking a warm bath, or doing some gentle stretches. 
3. **Make your bedroom sleep-friendly:** Keep it dark, quiet, and cool. Invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows. 
4. **Limit screen time before bed:** Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime. 
5. **Watch your diet:** Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and don't eat heavy meals close to bedtime. 

Remember, good sleep is not a luxury – it's a necessity for a healthy brain. Give it the priority it deserves!

# 2. Overloading on Caffeine

# The Caffeine Conundrum

Ah, caffeine. For many of us, it's the fuel that gets us through the day. That morning cup of coffee or that afternoon energy drink can feel like a lifesaver. But when it comes to your brain, too much caffeine can be a double-edged sword.

Don't get me wrong – caffeine isn't all bad. In moderate amounts, it can boost alertness and concentration. The problem comes when we start overloading.

# When Caffeine Backfires

Ever noticed how too much coffee can make you jittery and anxious? That's because caffeine stimulates your ""fight or flight"" response. In high doses, this can lead to:

1. Increased anxiety
2. Difficulty concentrating
3. Disrupted sleep patterns
4. Caffeine dependency

Here's something you might not know: caffeine can stay in your system for up to 10 hours. So that 3 PM coffee? It might still be affecting you at bedtime.

# Caffeine Tolerance and Withdrawal

If you're a regular caffeine consumer, you've probably noticed that you need more and more to get the same effect. This is called caffeine tolerance.

And if you've ever tried to quit cold turkey, you know all about caffeine withdrawal. Headaches, fatigue, and irritability are common symptoms. This can make it hard to cut back, even when we know we should.

# Healthier Energy Boosters

So, what can you do if you want to cut back on caffeine? Here are some alternatives:

1. **Stay hydrated:** Sometimes, what feels like fatigue is actually dehydration. Drink water regularly throughout the day. 
2. **Get moving:** A brisk walk or some quick exercises can boost your energy naturally. 
3. **Try herbal teas:** Many herbal teas can provide a gentle pick-me-up without the caffeine crash. 
4. **Eat for energy:** Choose foods that provide steady energy, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. 
5. **Power nap:** A short 10-20 minute nap can refresh you without interfering with nighttime sleep. 

Remember, it's not about completely eliminating caffeine (unless you want to). It's about finding a balance that works for you and your brain.

# 3. Skipping Exercise

# Your Brain on Exercise

Let's talk about exercise. Now, I know what you might be thinking: ""I thought this was about brain health, not physical fitness!"" But here's the thing – your brain and your body are not separate entities. They're intimately connected, and what's good for your body is often great for your brain.

Exercise isn't just about building muscles or losing weight. It's a powerful tool for boosting brain health. When you exercise, your body releases chemicals that can:

1. Improve mood
2. Reduce stress and anxiety
3. Enhance memory and thinking skills
4. Promote the growth of new brain cells

In fact, studies have shown that regular exercise can actually increase the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain involved in memory and learning.

# The Dangers of a Sedentary Lifestyle

On the flip side, a sedentary lifestyle can be bad news for your brain. Sitting for long periods has been linked to:

1. Slower cognitive function
2. Increased risk of depression
3. Higher likelihood of developing dementia later in life

It's not just about the exercise you're not getting – prolonged sitting itself seems to have negative effects on brain health.

# Moving More in Daily Life

Now, before you panic and think you need to become a gym rat, take a deep breath. Adding more movement to your life doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. Here are some simple ways to get more active:

1. **Take walking breaks:** If you sit a lot for work, try to take a 5-minute walk every hour. 
2. **Use a standing desk:** If possible, alternate between sitting and standing while you work. 
3. **Take the stairs:** Skip the elevator when you can. 
4. **Dance while you do chores:** Put on some music and move while you clean or cook. 
5. **Try active hobbies:** Gardening, dancing, or playing with pets all count as movement. 
6. **Park farther away:** A few extra steps here and there can add up. 
7. **Do bodyweight exercises during TV commercials:** Squats, push-ups, or jumping jacks can turn TV time into workout time. 

Remember, any movement is better than no movement. Start small and build up gradually. Your brain (and body) will thank you!

# 4. Poor Eating Habits

# You Are What You Eat (And So Is Your Brain)

We've all heard the saying ""you are what you eat,"" but did you know that this applies to your brain too? Your brain is always ""on."" It takes care of your thoughts and movements, your breathing and heartbeat, your senses — it works hard 24/7, even while you're asleep. This means your brain requires a constant supply of fuel. That ""fuel"" comes from the foods you eat — and what's in that fuel makes all the difference.

# Brain-Draining Foods

Unfortunately, many common foods in the typical Western diet can be bad news for our brains. Here are some of the worst offenders:

1. **Highly processed foods:** These often contain trans fats, which can cause inflammation and are linked to cognitive decline. 
2. **Sugary drinks:** High sugar intake has been associated with reduced brain volume and poorer memory. 
3. **Refined carbs:** White bread, pasta, and other refined carbs can lead to blood sugar spikes, which can impair brain function. 
4. **Alcohol:** While moderate consumption might have some benefits, excessive drinking can lead to brain damage over time. 
5. **Artificial sweeteners:** Some studies suggest these might have negative effects on brain health, though more research is needed. 

# Brain-Boosting Foods

Now for the good news: many delicious foods can actually boost your brain health! Here are some to consider adding to your diet:

1. **Fatty fish:** Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are crucial for brain health. 
2. **Berries:** Packed with antioxidants that can improve memory and delay brain aging. 
3. **Nuts and seeds:** Good sources of vitamin E, which is associated with less cognitive decline as you age. 
4. **Dark chocolate:** Contains caffeine and antioxidants that may help boost brain function. 
5. **Leafy greens:** High in nutrients like vitamin K, lutein, folate, and beta carotene, which can help slow cognitive decline. 
6. **Turmeric:** Contains curcumin, which may benefit memory and ease depression. 
7. **Eggs:** A good source of several brain-healthy nutrients, including vitamins B6 and B12, folate, and choline. 

# Making Better Food Choices

Changing your diet doesn't have to be drastic. Start with small steps:

1. Add a serving of berries to your breakfast.
2. Switch from white bread to whole grain.
3. Snack on nuts instead of chips.
4. Try to eat fish at least twice a week.
5. Experiment with new vegetables in your meals.

Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Every healthy choice you make is a win for your brain!

# 5. Constant Distraction

# The Age of Distraction

We live in an age of constant distraction. Our phones buzz with notifications, our inboxes overflow with emails, and our to-do lists seem never-ending. While technology has brought many benefits, it's also created an environment where our attention is constantly divided.

# The Cost of Multitasking

You might think you're being productive by juggling multiple tasks at once, but here's a surprising fact: our brains aren't actually wired for multitasking. What we call ""multitasking"" is really just rapid task-switching, and it comes at a cost:

1. **Reduced efficiency:** Each time you switch tasks, your brain needs time to refocus, slowing you down. 
2. **Increased errors:** Dividing your attention means you're more likely to make mistakes. 
3. **Higher stress levels:** Constant task-switching can leave you feeling overwhelmed and stressed. 
4. **Impaired creativity:** Deep, creative thinking requires sustained focus, which multitasking disrupts. 

# The Distracted Mind

Constant distraction doesn't just affect your productivity – it can actually change your brain over time. Studies have shown that people who frequently engage in media multitasking (like texting while watching TV) have less gray matter in the brain regions responsible for cognitive control and decision-making.

Moreover, the constant influx of information can lead to what's known as ""cognitive overload."" This state can impair our ability to think clearly, make decisions, and even form memories.

# Taming the Distraction Beast

So, how can we regain our focus in this distraction-filled world? Here are some strategies:

1. **Practice single-tasking:** Choose one task and focus on it fully before moving to the next. 
2. **Use the Pomodoro Technique:** Work in focused 25-minute bursts, followed by short breaks. 
3. **Create a distraction-free environment:** Turn off notifications, use website blockers, or try working in a quiet space. 
4. **Take regular breaks:** Paradoxically, scheduled breaks can help you stay focused during work periods. 
5. **Mindfulness meditation:** Regular meditation can improve your ability to focus and resist distractions. 
6. **Digital detox:** Try periods of time without your phone or social media. 
7. **Prioritize tasks:** Use to-do lists to focus on what's truly important. 

Remember, focus is like a muscle – the more you practice, the stronger it gets. Start small, be patient with yourself, and watch your concentration improve over time!

# 6. Social Media Overuse

# The Social Media Trap

Social media has revolutionized the way we connect and communicate. It's brought old friends back into our lives, helped us stay in touch with family, and given us platforms to express ourselves. But like many good things, too much can be harmful – especially for our brains.

# The Dark Side of Social Media

While social media can be a great tool, excessive use can have negative effects on mental health and cognitive function:

1. **Comparison and self-esteem issues:** Constantly seeing curated highlights of others' lives can lead to feelings of inadequacy. 
2. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** The constant stream of information can create anxiety about missing important events or interactions. 
3. **Dopamine addiction:** The likes, comments, and notifications trigger dopamine releases in our brains, creating addictive behavior patterns. 
4. **Sleep disruption:** Late-night scrolling can interfere with our sleep patterns, which in turn affects cognitive function. 
5. **Reduced attention span:** The rapid-fire nature of social media content can make it harder to focus on longer, more complex tasks. 
6. **Information overload:** The sheer volume of information can overwhelm our cognitive processes. 

# Social Media and Cognitive Decline

Recent studies have raised concerns about the long-term effects of heavy social media use on cognitive function. Some research suggests that excessive social media use may be associated with:

1. Poorer memory performance
2. Reduced ability to focus
3. Decreased cognitive flexibility
4. Potential changes in brain structure

While more research is needed, these findings highlight the importance of mindful social media use.

# Mindful Social Media Consumption

You don't have to quit social media entirely to protect your brain health. Here are some tips for more balanced use:

1. **Set time limits:** Use app features or separate timer apps to limit your daily social media time. 
2. **Create phone-free zones:** Designate certain areas (like your bedroom) or times (like during meals) as social media-free. 
3. **Turn off notifications:** This can help reduce the urge to constantly check your phone. 
4. **Be selective:** Follow accounts that genuinely add value to your life and unfollow those that don't. 
5. **Practice mindful usage:** Before you open a social media app, ask yourself why you're doing it. Is it habit, or do you have a specific purpose? 
6. **Have a digital detox:** Try taking a day (or more) off from social media regularly. 
7. **Engage in real-world social activities:** Balance online interactions with face-to-face connections. 

Remember, social media is a tool. Like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. By being mindful of our social media habits, we can enjoy its benefits while protecting our brain health.

# 7. Ignoring Mental Health

# The Mind-Brain Connection

When we talk about brain health, it's impossible to ignore mental health. Your mind and your brain are inextricably linked. Just as your mental state can affect your physical health, it can also impact your cognitive function.

# Mental Health and Cognitive Function

Poor mental health can have significant effects on your brain:

1. **Depression:** Can lead to difficulties with memory, concentration, and decision-making. 
2. **Anxiety:** May impair attention and working memory. 
3. **Chronic stress:** Can actually change the structure of your brain over time, affecting areas involved in memory and emotional regulation. 
4. **PTSD:** Can impact the hippocampus, affecting memory formation and recall. 

These effects aren't just temporary – chronic mental health issues can lead to long-term changes in brain structure and function.

# Recognizing Mental Distress

It's important to be aware of signs that you might be struggling with your mental health. Here are some common signs:

1. Persistent sad, anxious, or ""empty"" mood
2. Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
3. Irritability
4. Loss of interest in hobbies and activities
5. Decreased energy or fatigue
6. Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
7. Sleep disturbances (insomnia or oversleeping)
8. Changes in appetite or weight
9. Physical symptoms that don't respond to treatment (like headaches or digestive issues)

Remember, experiencing some of these symptoms occasionally is normal. It's when they persist or interfere with your daily life that they become a concern.

# Nurturing Your Mental Health

Taking care of your mental health is a crucial part of maintaining overall brain health. Here are some strategies:

1. **Seek professional help:** If you're struggling, don't hesitate to talk to a mental health professional. 
2. **Practice self-care:** This can include activities like regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep. 
3. **Develop a support network:** Strong social connections are vital for mental health. 
4. **Try mindfulness or meditation:** These practices can help reduce stress and improve emotional regulation. 
5. **Set realistic goals:** Accomplishing tasks, even small ones, can boost your mood and self-esteem. 
6. **Limit alcohol and avoid drugs:** Substance use can worsen mental health issues. 
7. **Practice gratitude:** Regularly acknowledging the good things in your life can improve your overall outlook. 
8. **Engage in activities you enjoy:** Hobbies and pleasurable activities can provide a sense of accomplishment and joy. 

Remember, taking care of your mental health isn't selfish – it's necessary. Just as you wouldn't ignore a physical health problem, don't ignore your mental health. Your brain will thank you for it!

# 8. Neglecting Hydration

# Water: The Brain's Best Friend

We all know that water is essential for life, but did you know that it's particularly crucial for your brain? Your brain is about 75% water, and even mild dehydration can have a significant impact on how it functions.

# The Dehydrated Brain

When you don't drink enough water, your brain can't operate at its best. Here's what happens:

1. **Reduced cognitive performance:** Dehydration can affect attention, memory, and decision-making skills. 
2. **Mood changes:** You might feel more irritable, anxious, or fatigued when you're not properly hydrated. 
3. **Headaches:** Dehydration is a common trigger for headaches and migraines. 
4. **Slower reaction times:** This can be particularly dangerous if you're driving or operating machinery. 
5. **Difficulty with complex thinking:** Tasks that require a lot of brainpower become more challenging. 

# Signs of Dehydration

Many people walk around mildly dehydrated without even realizing it. Here are some signs to watch out for:

1. Feeling thirsty (by the time you feel thirsty, you're already slightly dehydrated)
2. Dark yellow urine
3. Dry mouth
4. Fatigue
5. Dizziness
6. Headache
7. Reduced urination

# Staying Hydrated

So, how can you make sure you're getting enough water? Here are some practical tips:

1. **Carry a water bottle:** Having water with you makes it easier to drink regularly. 
2. **Set reminders:** Use your phone or a app to remind you to drink water throughout the day. 
3. **Eat water-rich foods:** Fruits like watermelon, strawberries, and cucumbers can contribute to your fluid intake. 
4. **Flavor your water:** If plain water doesn't appeal to you, try adding slices of lemon, cucumber, or berries. 
5. **Start your day with water:** Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning to rehydrate after sleep. 
6. **Monitor your urine color:** Aim for light yellow urine – if it's darker, you need to drink more. 
7. **Increase intake during exercise or hot weather:** You lose more water through sweat in these conditions. 

Remember, while the old advice of ""8 glasses a day"" is a good starting point, individual needs can vary based on factors like activity level, climate, and overall health. Listen to your body and drink when you're thirsty.

By keeping yourself well-hydrated, you're giving your brain the best possible environment to function at its peak. So raise a glass (of water) to your brain health!

# 9. Eating Late at Night

# The Midnight Snack Dilemma

We've all been there – it's late, you're watching TV or working on a project, and suddenly you feel peckish. That bag of chips or leftover pizza starts calling your name. While a late-night snack might satisfy your craving, it could be doing more harm than good, especially when it comes to your brain health.

# Late-Night Eating and Your Brain

Eating late at night can affect your brain in several ways:

1. **Disrupted sleep:** Digesting food can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and reduce sleep quality. 
2. **Blood sugar fluctuations:** Late-night eating, especially of sugary or high-carb foods, can cause blood sugar spikes and crashes, affecting your mood and cognitive function the next day. 
3. **Increased inflammation:** Some studies suggest that eating out of sync with your body's natural rhythms can increase inflammation, which is linked to cognitive decline. 
4. **Weight gain:** Late-night eating is associated with weight gain, and excess weight can negatively impact brain health. 

# The Circadian Connection

Your body operates on a 24-hour cycle known as the circadian rhythm. This internal clock doesn't just control your sleep-wake cycle – it also regulates various bodily functions, including digestion and metabolism.

When you eat late at night, you're essentially telling your body to fire up the digestive process when it should be winding down. This can throw off your circadian rhythm, which in turn can affect your brain function.

# Timing Meals for Brain Health

So, when should you eat for optimal brain health? Here are some guidelines:

1. **Eat your last meal 2-3 hours before bedtime:** This gives your body time to digest before sleep. 
2. **Try to eat meals at consistent times each day:** This helps regulate your circadian rhythm. 
3. **Make breakfast a priority:** Eating a nutritious breakfast can help stabilize your blood sugar and provide energy for your brain. 
4. **Consider intermittent fasting:** Some studies suggest that limiting your eating window (for example, eating only between 8 AM and 6 PM) may have cognitive benefits. 

# Dealing with Late-Night Hunger

If you find yourself hungry late at night, try these strategies:

1. **Drink water:** Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger. 
2. **Choose light, protein-rich snacks:** If you must eat, opt for something like a small handful of nuts or a piece of cheese. 
3. **Avoid sugary or high-carb foods:** These can spike your blood sugar and make it harder to sleep. 
4. **Address the underlying cause:** Are you eating enough during the day? Are you staying up too late? Tackling these issues might help reduce late-night cravings. 
5. **Distract yourself:** Sometimes, engaging in a different activity can help take your mind off food. 

Remember, occasional late-night eating isn't likely to cause significant harm. It's when it becomes a regular habit that it can start to impact your brain health. By being mindful of when you eat, you're giving your brain (and body) the best chance to rest and recharge overnight.

# 10. Negative Self-Talk

# The Power of Inner Dialogue

We all have an inner voice – that running commentary in our heads that narrates our day, analyzes our actions, and shapes our self-perception. When this inner voice turns negative, it can have a profound impact on our mental state and, by extension, our brain health.

# How Negative Self-Talk Affects Your Brain

Negative self-talk isn't just unpleasant – it can actually change your brain chemistry:

1. **Stress hormone production:** Negative thoughts can trigger the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which in high levels can damage the hippocampus (the brain's memory center). 
2. **Neural pathways:** Repeatedly thinking negative thoughts strengthens the neural pathways associated with negativity, making it easier for your brain to default to negative thinking in the future. 
3. **Reduced cognitive function:** Dwelling on negative thoughts can occupy mental resources, leaving less brainpower for other cognitive tasks. 
4. **Increased risk of mental health issues:** Chronic negative self-talk is associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression. 

# Recognizing Negative Self-Talk

Negative self-talk can take many forms. Here are some common types:

1. **All-or-nothing thinking:** Seeing things in black and white categories. Example: ""If I'm not perfect, I'm a total failure."" 
2. **Overgeneralization:** Viewing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat. Example: ""I didn't get the job. I'll never find a good job."" 
3. **Mental filtering:** Focusing solely on the negative aspects of a situation. Example: Dwelling on one criticism and ignoring multiple compliments. 
4. **Jumping to conclusions:** Making negative interpretations without actual evidence. Example: ""He didn't text back. He must hate me."" 
5. **Catastrophizing:** Expecting the worst possible outcome in any situation. Example: ""If I make a mistake at work, I'll definitely get fired."" 

# Transforming Negative Self-Talk

The good news is that with practice, you can change your patterns of self-talk. Here are some strategies:

1. **Catch yourself:** The first step is becoming aware of your negative self-talk. When you notice it, pause and reflect. 
2. **Challenge negative thoughts:** Ask yourself if your thought is based on fact or feeling. Is there evidence to support it? 
3. **Reframe:** Try to find a more balanced or positive way to view the situation. Example: Instead of ""I'm terrible at this,"" try ""I'm still learning and improving."" 
4. **Use positive affirmations:** Regular use of positive statements can help rewire your brain over time. 
5. **Practice self-compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness you'd offer a good friend. 
6. **Visualize success:** Imagine yourself handling situations successfully and confidently. 
7. **Surround yourself with positivity:** Spend time with supportive people and engage with uplifting content. 

Remember, changing your self-talk is a process. It takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. By cultivating a more positive inner dialogue, you're not just improving your mood – you're creating a healthier environment for your brain to thrive.

# 11. Overconsumption of Sugar

# The Sweet Deception

Sugar – it's in so many of the foods we love, and it can be hard to resist. But when it comes to your brain health, too much sugar can be a real problem. Let's dive into why sugar can be a brain-killer and how you can cut back.

# Sugar and Your Brain

You might be surprised to learn just how much sugar can impact your brain:

1. **Cognitive decline:** High sugar intake has been linked to poorer memory and reduced brain volume, particularly in areas associated with memory. 
2. **Mood swings:** Sugar can cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood glucose levels, leading to irritability and mood swings. 
3. **Increased risk of depression:** Some studies suggest a link between high sugar consumption and higher rates of depression. 
4. **Inflammation:** Excess sugar can cause inflammation throughout the body, including in the brain, which is associated with cognitive decline. 
5. **Addiction-like effects:** Sugar can trigger the release of dopamine, the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter, leading to cravings and potentially addictive eating patterns. 

# Hidden Sugars

One of the tricky things about sugar is that it's often hidden in foods you might not expect. Here are some common sources of hidden sugars:

1. Salad dressings
2. Pasta sauces
3. Yogurt
4. Granola and cereal bars
5. Flavored coffees
6. Smoothies
7. ""Low-fat"" products (often high in sugar to compensate for taste)

# Strategies for Reducing Sugar Intake

Cutting back on sugar doesn't mean you have to give up all sweet treats. Here are some strategies to help you reduce your sugar consumption:

1. **Read labels:** Get in the habit of checking nutrition labels for sugar content. Remember, 4 grams of sugar equals 1 teaspoon. 
2. **Choose whole foods:** Opt for whole fruits instead of fruit juices or processed snacks. 
3. **Swap sugary drinks:** Replace sodas and sweetened teas with water, unsweetened tea, or sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice. 
4. **Use natural sweeteners:** Try using fruits like bananas or dates to sweeten foods naturally. 
5. **Gradually reduce:** If you usually add two sugars to your coffee, try reducing to one and a half, then one, and so on. 
6. **Eat balanced meals:** Including protein and healthy fats in your meals can help stabilize blood sugar and reduce cravings. 
7. **Get enough sleep:** Lack of sleep can increase cravings for sugary foods. 
8. **Manage stress:** Many people turn to sugary comfort foods when stressed. Find alternative stress-relief methods like exercise or meditation. 
9. **Be mindful of artificial sweeteners:** While they don't contain sugar, some studies suggest they may still trigger sugar cravings. 

Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate sugar entirely – that would be nearly impossible and probably not much fun. Instead, aim to be more mindful of your sugar intake and make small, sustainable changes over time. Your brain (and the rest of your body) will thank you!

# 12. Lack of Mental Challenges

# Keeping Your Brain in Shape

Just like your body needs regular exercise to stay fit, your brain needs mental challenges to stay sharp. Without regular stimulation, your cognitive abilities can decline over time. Let's explore why mental challenges are so important and how you can incorporate more of them into your daily life.

# Use It or Lose It: The Brain's Mantra

The brain operates on a ""use it or lose it"" principle. Here's why mental challenges are crucial:

1. **Neural plasticity:** Challenging your brain helps create new neural connections and strengthen existing ones. 
2. **Cognitive reserve:** Regular mental stimulation can build up your brain's resilience against age-related decline and diseases like Alzheimer's. 
3. **Improved focus:** Mental exercises can enhance your ability to concentrate and ignore distractions. 
4. **Better memory:** Engaging in mentally stimulating activities can improve both short-term and long-term memory. 
5. **Enhanced problem-solving skills:** Regular mental challenges can boost your ability to think creatively and solve complex problems. 

# Signs of Mental Stagnation

How do you know if you're not challenging your brain enough? Look out for these signs:

1. Feeling bored or unstimulated frequently
2. Difficulty concentrating on tasks
3. Trouble remembering recent events or information
4. Feeling ""stuck in a rut"" or resistant to new ideas
5. Decreased creativity or problem-solving ability

# Brain-Boosting Activities

The good news is that there are countless ways to challenge your brain. Here are some ideas:

1. **Learn a new skill:** Whether it's a language, a musical instrument, or a craft, learning something new is great for your brain. 
2. **Play strategy games:** Chess, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, and other brain teasers can give your mind a workout. 
3. **Read widely:** Explore different genres and topics to expose your brain to new ideas and information. 
4. **Write:** Try journaling, creative writing, or even starting a blog to engage different parts of your brain. 
5. **Solve math problems:** Even if you're not a math whiz, simple calculations without a calculator can be a good mental exercise. 
6. **Take a different route:** Change up your daily commute or routine to challenge your spatial awareness. 
7. **Learn to juggle:** This physical skill actually creates new neural connections in your brain. 
8. **Try mind-mapping:** This visual thinking tool can help you organize information and boost creativity. 
9. **Engage in discussions:** Debating ideas or explaining concepts to others can sharpen your thinking. 
10. **Use your non-dominant hand:** Try brushing your teeth or writing with your other hand to challenge your brain. 

# Incorporating Mental Challenges into Daily Life

You don't need to set aside hours each day for brain training. Here are some ways to sneak mental challenges into your routine:

1. **Morning brain warm-up:** Start your day with a quick puzzle or brain teaser. 
2. **Lunchtime learning:** Use your lunch break to read an article on a new topic or practice a language app. 
3. **Commute challenges:** Listen to educational podcasts or audiobooks during your commute. 
4. **Evening wind-down:** End your day with a game of chess or a crossword puzzle instead of watching TV. 
5. **Weekend projects:** Take on a new DIY project or hobby that challenges you to learn new skills. 

Remember, the key is consistency and variety. Mix up your mental challenges to keep your brain engaged and growing. By regularly challenging your mind, you're investing in your cognitive health and potentially staving off mental decline as you age. So go ahead, give your brain a workout!

# 13. Ignoring Sunlight

# Sunshine: More Than Just Vitamin D

We all know that sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D, but did you know that sunshine also plays a crucial role in brain health? Let's shed some light on why getting enough sun exposure is important for your cognitive function and overall well-being.

# Sunlight and Your Brain

Sunlight affects your brain in several important ways:

1. **Mood regulation:** Sunlight stimulates the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood. This is why many people experience seasonal affective disorder (SAD) during darker winter months. 
2. **Circadian rhythm:** Natural light helps regulate your body's internal clock, which affects sleep patterns, hormone production, and even cognitive function. 
3. **Cognitive performance:** Some studies suggest that exposure to natural light during the day can improve cognitive performance.

To incorporate more sunlight into your life, try to spend at least 15–30 minutes outside each day. You can take a walk during your lunch break, sit on your porch, or even do some gardening. If it’s not possible to get outside, consider opening your curtains wide to let in as much light as possible.

# 14. Avoiding New Experiences

Sticking to the same routine can lead to cognitive stagnation. When we do the same activities every day, our brains can become less adaptable. Trying new experiences can help keep your mind sharp and engaged. Whether it’s picking up a new hobby, exploring a different route to work, or joining a class, stepping out of your comfort zone can boost your brain health.

Consider activities that challenge you mentally or physically. Attend a cooking class, learn a new language, or even travel to a place you’ve never been. These experiences stimulate your brain and help you grow.

# 15. Holding onto Grudges

Holding onto grudges can take a toll on your mental health. Resentment can create stress and anxiety, which negatively impacts your brain. Forgiveness, on the other hand, can lead to emotional healing and better mental clarity. Studies show that letting go of grudges can improve overall well-being.

To foster forgiveness, start by reflecting on what has hurt you. Acknowledge your feelings, but try to find a way to let them go. Techniques like journaling your thoughts or talking to a trusted friend can help. Practicing empathy towards those who have wronged you can also be a powerful step in releasing resentment.

# Conclusion

In this article, we explored 15 habits that can harm your brain health. From neglecting sunlight to holding onto grudges, each habit can affect your cognitive function and emotional well-being. It’s important to reflect on your daily routines and consider how they impact your mind.

Making small changes can lead to significant improvements in your brain health. Start by focusing on one habit at a time. Remember, nurturing your brain is essential for a fulfilling life. Prioritize your [mental ](https://softtechhub.us/2024/12/16/15-brain-damaging-habits/)well-being, and you’ll find yourself feeling more vibrant and engaged in the world around you.

As mentioned in my previous call for nominations, the Proton fundraiser 2024 is a program where many open-source projects about privacy get to receive funding by the big company Proton that focuses on building secure, end-to-end encrypted software: https://www.reddit.com/r/VeraCrypt/comments/1gl7wgx/urgent_lets_nominate_veracrypt_for_the_proton/

We all did our best trying to get VeraCrypt nominated, support the developers, most notably Mr. Idrassi, but to my great disappointment, VeraCrypt did not make it into the final selection of receivers for the 2024 fundraiser.

This should, however, not mark the end of our community's efforts. I hereby wish everyone reading this and enjoying VeraCrypt to consider leaving a donation, be it just in the value of a cup of coffee. This software keeps journalists, activists, companies and individuals of all kinds safe - anywhere, everywhere around the world, and it marks the backbone of many modern cybersecurity systems.

If there's one person I know in software development who deserves more respect and funding, it is - without any doubt - the VeraCrypt maintainer. So please, think about it. I am sure he will put the money to great use.

I wish you all the best. We will try again next year, won't we? :)

1hfu5kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hfu5kl/i_think_im_just_giving_up_on_losing_weight/,I think I'm just giving up on losing weight,"Before you read: This is also a little bit of a rant, but overall I'm just sad and frustrated so please don't take any of this as an offense.

I (31 F, 167cm, 82 kg +-) think there's just no point in trying anymore. 
When I was around 24 or sth, I lost weight. From 80+ kg sth down to 58kg. Purely by dieting, no sports, no counting calories.i just cut out crappy food and ate at certain times. Also I didn't really pay attention to portion sizes, I just ate normally, idk.

Then I regained weight to sth like 76-78 kg.
During corona it went up to 96 kg. I stopped having midnight snacks, eating fast food, eating sweets etc. I basically did intermittend fasting. But I'm not sure if it really was the intermittend part that caused me to lose weight or just the restricted time window to eat which resulted in me eating less overall. Anyhow I went down to around what I weigh now. Then nothing. I plateaued. For months and months on end. 
Fyi I sit on my PC 99% of the day, but I always did, my PC is basically my life, work and hobby related. But since most ppl you ask will tell you that losing weight is 95% your diet, this shouldn't matter anyways.

After not losing anything for idk how long, I gave up for a while. 

Then started again in January. Tried intermittend fasting again. Nothing. Tried calorie counting, going on the treadmill daily for 90 min at 4 - 4.5 mph a day, nothing. 
Usually I eat around 1000-1200 kcal a day. Used Internet resources to know how many calories my meals have roughly. Even asked chat gpt cuz in addition cuz it's easy to just enter what you ate and let it sum it up.i also checked the numbers it used online to see if it calculated somewhat correctly. 
I'm also very honest about it while counting. Also my meals are healthy. And tbh I hate calorie counting. I don't want to measure each and every damn Ingredient of every damn meal, but how am I supposed to count otherwise.

Most calculators suggest I use up 1800 kcal a day and that I should eat around 1300-1400 kcal a day. When I eat those my weight just goes up to 84 or sth. I tried eating more for a while. Internet said u can eat too little, so I ate more, just gained. Then Internet said if u eat less than u use, you lose weight no matter what. There's no way I eat more than I use, I can't explain how I maintain weight the way I do.
No, I'm healthy. No underlying disease, hormones or w/e. Already checkt with a doctor. 

And it's so frustrating to hear ""Jerry started cutting out sodas and walks around the block 10 min each day and lost 80 kg"".
I eat two meals a day. I walked on the treadmill each day. Did intermittend fasting. Ate more temporarily, ate less temporarily, I only drink water or 0 sugar sodas and 2 coffees with 1.5% fat and sugar free syrup cuz I enjoy them. And yes I eat some sweets now and then, like one macrone or sth in the ballpark of a Snickers. 
You can call me a liar if you want, I can only say I really tried. I tried not eating any sweets at all. Tried using the treadmill daily, only drink water etc and still to this day the weight moves between 81 and 83 kg. Its like I physically cannot go below 80kg anymore.
Why I'm posting this?
Most likely because my stupid brain hopes that someone somehow finds the magic solution I didn't try out yet so I would finally lose weight.
But I know this won't happen. Most people will probably tell me to either accept the way I am, or say conflicting things like ""MB your body is in starvation mode/ no there is no such thing as starvation mode/ you should try keto/ no, carbs are not the enemy"" etc etc etc. 
At the end of the day I will just have to accept that I remain overweight.

1hfu4vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/1hfu4vr/account_reported/,Account Reported,"So my account is presently on hold because apparently, last night, a rider reported me for possibly 'driving under the influence.' This, of course, is completely false; not only do I not drink, but I actually CAN'T drink due to my regime of daily heart medications. I haven't a had drink since last year's superbowl at which I had 1 single beer. I don't do any drugs either, including weed, which I quit smoking like 8+ months ago when the cardiologists who treated me for the heart attack I had last spring (due to which I'm on the aforementioned medications) advised me that my smoking habits had likely been the chief contributing factor to my having said attack. The only thing that consume apart from my prescribed meds — which I take only according to their prescribed usage — is coffee, and even then no more than 1 or 2 cups/day. I have no record of DUI and haven't even gotten so much as a speeding ticket since I was 17. 

I responded to Uber explaining that I don't and can't drink or do any drugs, and that I'd happily take and pass any drug test they'd like me to, and could even submit medical records testifying to my sobriety. Not only that, but I have dashcam and Hurdlr records documenting that I'd done nothing but drive from basically 3PM-3:30AM on the shift in question, which I also offered to submit if they want, although they haven't asked me yet.

I'm not sure which rider it was, it would been one of 3 people given the time frame but I can't be absolutely certain. I have my suspicions of which, and it was one where I took the wrong exit getting onto the highway in a busy downtown area after a show, after which the passenger kept nervously back sweet driving for the rest of the trip. I listened politely and did everything they said (all things I was already going to do anyway.) I saw not long after that I'd gotten my first ever 1 star rating for 'Driving Fast.' I'll fully own up to taking the wrong exit, it's a rookie mistake and I should've known better. As for 'driving fast' I'll call that a matter of perspective and note that nobody else, friends, family, or passengers, have mentioned anything to that effect to me before, but it's not impossible I suppose. But I absolutely, categorically, definitely was NOT under the influence of anything.  

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone else who's been through something similar has any advice or suggestions about how to deal with this moving forward? I don't want to get kicked off the app of course, so any insight would be greatly appreciated.

1hfu3pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1hfu3pl/a_story_i_never_thought_id_share/,A story I never thought I'd share... ,"Storytime (sorry this is a LONG one) 
Okay... so this story goes way back to 2013 and I'm working at esso over the nightshift during summer between semesters. I was maybe 18 at the time. One evening these two very intoxicated guys came into the store the first guy we'll call :T"" came in and asked for a hug, I was really young, shy, and didn't want any trouble so I agreed awkwardly. After T left the other guy ""G"" walked up to me and asked for help picking a Gatorade so I did. While I was ringing him up he asked for my number. Again, I'm shy, awkward, and I don't want to cause a scene. So I give my number. 
In the next few days I get a text from G ,hes actually quite nice and we keep in contact for a while. Things fizzle out after he finds out I have a bf. And shortly after that he finds a gf. Which is great for him and time goes on. I have him as a friend on fb and maybe 3 years later I see he's expecting. Wonderful news so I like his post. He obviously saw that I liked it and he messages me on fb and asks if I want to meet up for coffee. I agree and we are catching up and it was a surprisingly good time. Around this time I broke up with my bf because he doesn't know what he's doing with his life, wants to move away, and start somewhere fresh... I was devastated and kind of in a vulnerable state of mind and I feel so lost we had our life mapped out and it all collapsed in what felt like a day. My high-school sweetheart was gone, and who was i to stop him from finding out who he is and wants to be.. 

The next two years  were difficult for me I'm walking around with this hole in my chest and who happens to message me... G and he tells me he's also going through a breakup so we decide to meet up and concole in one another. After that I felt really connected to G and we started seeing each other more and more, he painted this picture of his ex being this horrible, awful, selfish, childish person. She was moving out of their house and he invited me to stay over sometimes and so I did. G and I began dating during this time his daughter would be over during the weekend he was off, he worked a shift off 7 days 7 off 7 nights and it would just rotate like this. So during the 7 off I would stay with him until the weekend so he could spend time with his daughter. Eventually I would slowly become part of those weekends and help with changing her, feeding her, and going out with her. It was just as those movie fantasies, a cute happy little family. I got a job at a local school and I'm working with kids all the time too, it just seemed so perfect! 

A few years pass and this goes on for a while then suddenly things change his daughter is having seizures, she is non verbal, but is screaming and yelling all the time. She's diagnosed with severe autism and as time progresses she is becoming more and more violent biting, kicking, hitting and also develops pica. I do what I can to help both of them but my life is also starting to bloom, I am fortunate to get scouted for a modeling company and I'm heading off to Paris for a once in a lifetime opportunity to walk a runway! I have to go! And so I do. G is very upset with this and has all these weird accusations of how I'm going down there to meet with some other dude and sleep with people because now I'm this fancy model going to Paris and tells me the school probably wont let me take time off to do this. To me this is shocking because my coworkers and boss are very encouraging and give me time off i also have been doing what I can to make him feel loved, I take care of chores, his daughter, his house and him this whole time I'm all about him. And I tell him this as well. He is still very upset with me but I end up going anyway (this is around September 2020 just before covid) when I get back he's happy but still quite cold because he has all these wild ideas of me cheating on him. I reassure him that wasn't the case and even offer my phone to him and I'm willing to offer evidence of how I'm dedicated to only him. He refuses but thanks me and said that was reassuring enough

Time goes on his ex is going to  have another baby with her now husband, so we have his daughter even more, usually for the entire week he's off. during the week hes working we have now fallen into this robotic routine and we start to slowly just get take out and sit in front of the TV and that's what life became. Dull and boring. There were no more dates, or romantic moments, i had to ask him to buy me flowers for my bithday, I did my best to do special things and offer to go on fun little dates but he started to get drained from work and having his daughter the entire time he's off and with covid there's new rules and regulations he has to follow i try to be as understanding and as patient as i can, because i know hes going through a lot. Diring this time I'm working  remotely and he starts to complain that I'm ""always there"" so I decided to just give him space and I go visit my folks for a few weeks at this point a new regulation has passed about staying within our own ""bubble"" and he takes this opportunity to tell me not to come home and to stay away for safety reasons. So I agree because at this time health and safety was at the forefront of my mind and I didn't think anything of it. Finally the regulations are lifted and I go home. He is visibly upset with me calling me names and saying how selfish I am for going to see my parents during this time. I apologize and feel horrible and I agreed with him I should've just stayed away from them I told him I wouldn't do that again and he seems satisfied with this. 

Life continues on and things are getting worse with his daughter and I also notice his ex making complaints about me and she's telling him that she doesn't like me. I sort of just brush this off since he later tells me that she's just jealous. His daughter is getting out of control between the constant screaming, smearing her feces on the walls, and the violence it's been more and more difficult with her but I still try to help because I know she didn't choose this life and needs support too. I try to let G know about how we have kiddos like this at the school and it helps so much to have structure and lots of repetitive practices like pointing to visual cards when they want to communicate, making sure they're sitting while they eat, and having every day as close to the same as possible to follow a predictable routine. He ignores me and says its too hard and to not interfere anymore with parenting, so I respect his wishes. His ex is trying to potty train and I offer to help and I'm met with cold and blank stares and am basically told off. So I recoil from helping too much as to not overstep anyone's boundaries. But because of that G is now calling me names and saying I don't help with his daughter as much as I used to. At this point I am feeling horrible about everything and very stuck. So I do more to help and it seemed to relax a little.

 Thankfully, covid rules are now starting to fade and I want to start visiting my folks during the week and when I could. G encourages me to that so for a week here and there or a weekend I'm away visiting. It's around late November at this time and I decided to do something special for G and his daughter, he doesn't have many photos of them together so I said I'd love to take some pictures for him. It feels like the beginning again with the happy family Kodak moments, we're up in the mountains with snow all around his daughter is bundled up in her cute little snow suit and he's pulling her around on a sled! It's almost like magic and I feel hopeful again. Later that evening I let him know I'm going to upload the photos for him and do some editing while he puts her to bed. He normally has to take quite a bit of time doing this because she doesn't have a regular bedtime and puts up a fuss, but this evening with all the fun they both ended up falling asleep while I worked on the photos. Somehow I accidentally close the photo app and have to reopen it and scroll all the way to thee bottom to get back to them.... as I'm scrolling I see so many pictures .... screenshots of text messages... I don't think he realized but his iCloud was also uploading to this app and I saw EVERYTHING messages between him and his ex, nudes of her.. I keep scrolling there's some random images of nudes between him and someone else, there's time stamps on everything too.... I become aware that these are recent. I'm in total shock so I open up the image of the random nude and in a panic gather all of my stuff and head out the door. I'm freaking out and crying at this point. And I decide to pull over and call one of my friends to tell him what happened and he offered to get a hotel room for me to stay in so that I could have a quiet place to be and so I do that. The next day I am FLOODED with texts and calls from G and I ignore them all. I dont understand how a married woman would cheat on her husband with her ex. I don't know who this other mystery woman is. I'm heartbroken and furious. Eventually I cave and answer. He's crying saying he fuxked up and he said ""come back home, I need you"" pulling my heartstrings so of course I go back (like a naive idiot) and we have a conversation. I say no more conversations or sharing images like that eith your ex. And I ask who the other woman was and he said ""nothing, it was no one, it didn't mean anything. It was just a moment of weakness"" So I decided we can try to work things out, because as hurt and upset as i was, i still loved and cared for him...As time goes on I get paranoid and i decided to go though our laptop. I find out he's logged into all his social media so against my better nature I go though everything. I find out he's sleeping with numerous other people and also trying to create relationships with them. And I decided to take a photo of the tattoos of the nameless nude to see if I can find out who this ""nothing, no one, meaningless"" person is. I decided not to make a big deal this time and to just quietly observe and check in on the accounts here and there. This continues for maybe a few weeks and it's made clear to me that he has no consideration or respect for me, my feelings, or our relationship. I am scrolling trying to find this other woman. And skip over one that I deemed unnecessary due to their relationship... but for some reason I am called to click on her name since I found their thread of messages in his ""trash"" folder. Let's call her ""A."" 
I click on A and there it all is, black and white in front of me, she needs money, so she will sell her body to him. While I pay for groceries, home renovation, his daughters diapers. He's paying to get off. 
I don't believe my own eyes at this point. No this has to be a front for someone else. So I go on my own Facebook page and scroll through her photos, sure enough. The tattoos match. 
I am baffled. Disgusted. Sick to my stomach. 
Not only is he continuing cheating on me with his ex, trying to find others to cheat on me with. . . . He is also cheating on me with his first cousin. 

This is already a monster of a story that took up a lot of my youth, happiness, money, time... 
So to sum it up. the end...  It was pretty messy... i took the high road and didnt destroy someone elses marrage, i never outed him or tarnished his reputation, i never outed his cousin, i feel like being this messed up has to be punishment enough... right?? I never told this story until now years later. Everyone is blocked. I walked away with what felt like a sliver of dignity i had left after finding out this was going on the whole time right under my nose. It broke my heart to have to walk away from the little one too. It was honestly devastating for me. 

After that one of my girlfriends made me a tinder account, I had fun,  went on dates, i was treated like a princess, showered with gifts, fancy dinners, flowers, and met the man of my dreams who dances in the snow with me, makes sure I feel safe and secure, and loves me endlessly. 
I think you're supposed to fall in love with the wrong person I think you need to fight and cry and sweat and bleed and fail. I think you need to have bad relationships and bad break ups. I think you need all of that so that when the right person and the right relationship comes along you can sigh with relief and say, ""ah yes. That is how it is supposed to feel.""

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic treatment, as more people desire a bright, confident smile. It’s not just about aesthetic appeal; the transformative effects of teeth whitening can boost your self-esteem and create a change in how others perceive you. Many wonder about the real differences teeth whitening can bring, especially when looking at the before and after results.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening Treatments

Teeth whitening treatments come in various forms, each with its unique pros and cons. Here are some popular options:

- **Professional In-Office Whitening:** This method uses strong whitening agents and is done by a dental professional. It typically shows the fastest and most dramatic results.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits can vary in effectiveness. They usually contain lower concentrations of whitening agents, which can lighten teeth over time.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** While it helps in removing surface stains, it often doesn’t produce significant whitening results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Options like baking soda and hydrogen peroxide may lighten teeth slightly but often require consistent use and may take longer to show effects.

### The Immediate Impact: Before and After

When considering teeth whitening, it’s helpful to look at actual before and after results. Many people are amazed at how a brighter smile can dramatically change their appearance. The stains that once dulled your smile can disappear, leaving a more radiant look. Here are some common transformations after treatment:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Increased Brightness:** Many patients can achieve teeth that are several shades lighter, leading to a more youthful appearance.
- **Enhanced Self-Confidence:** A bright smile can encourage you to smile more, significantly boosting your self-esteem.
- **Improved Social Interactions:** A whiter smile can make you feel more approachable, improving how you relate to others.

### Real-Life Stories of Transformation

Consider the experience of James, who felt self-conscious about his stained teeth from years of coffee drinking. After undergoing professional whitening, he found himself smiling more freely in social settings. His colleagues noticed his newfound confidence, leading him to engage more at work.

Then there’s Sarah, who always dreamed of having a Hollywood smile but felt hesitant to pursue it. After treatment, her friends couldn’t stop complimenting her smile, and she even received a call back for a job interview she feared she wouldn’t get. These personal stories highlight the significance of the transformation that occurs after teeth whitening treatments.

### The Aftercare: Maintaining Your New Smile

To sustain the results of teeth whitening, proper aftercare is essential. Here are some tips for maintaining that beautiful smile:

- **Avoid Staining Foods and Beverages:** Limit your intake of coffee, tea, red wine, and dark-colored foods for at least a few days post-treatment.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss daily, and consider using a whitening toothpaste.
- **Regular Dental Visits:** Schedule cleanings with your dentist at least twice a year to keep stains at bay and check your overall dental health.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** Consider using at-home whitening kits or touch-up treatments recommended by your dentist to maintain brightness.

### Considerations Before Whitening

Before diving into teeth whitening, several factors may influence your decision:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Existing Dental Issues:** If you have cavities or gum disease, it's best to address these problems first with your dentist.
- **Type of Stains:** Some stains respond better to treatments than others. For example, yellowish stains often lighten better than grayish ones.
- **Expectations:** Understand that results can vary; manage your expectations and communicate with your dentist about what’s realistically achievable.

The transformative effects of teeth whitening before and after treatments can be life-changing for many individuals. It opens doors to enhanced confidence, better social interactions, and an overall brighter smile. Taking the right treatment path and committing to care afterward creates the best possible results for your stunning new smile.

Safe and Effective Methods for Achieving Teeth Whitening Results
----------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that can significantly enhance your smile. Many people seek methods that are safe and effective. To achieve these goals, it’s essential to understand the various options available and choose the right one for your needs.

In the realm of teeth whitening, you have multiple choices. These methods range from professional treatments at dental clinics to over-the-counter products you can use at home. Knowing the differences between these methods can help you make an informed decision.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Professional Teeth Whitening

If you want quick and impressive results, visiting a dentist is often the best path. Here are some professional options:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This procedure typically uses a stronger bleaching agent. The results are instant, often brightening teeth several shades in one session.
- **Take-Home Kits:** Many dentists provide customized kits for at-home whitening. These kits include custom-fitted trays and a lower concentration of whitening gel, ensuring safety and effectiveness.
- **Consultation:** Before starting any whitening process, it’s wise to have an initial consultation. A dentist can evaluate your teeth and suggest the best whitening plan tailored to you.

### At-Home Whitening Methods

If professional whitening is out of reach for you, there are safe and effective at-home options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Many brands offer toothpaste that includes mild abrasives and chemical agents to help remove surface stains. This option is gentle and can be used daily.
- **Whitening Strips:** These thin, flexible plastic strips are coated with a peroxide-based gel. You'll need to wear them for a specified time each day for a week or two. Regular use can lighten teeth effectively.
- **Gel Trays:** Over-the-counter kits often come with a tray and whitening gel. These trays may not fit as well as custom trays from a dentist, but they can still achieve desirable results.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Options

If you're looking for more natural alternatives, several methods can assist in brightening your smile:

- **Baking Soda:** Using a paste of baking soda and water can help scrub away surface stains. Limit this method to once a week to avoid damaging enamel.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Known for its natural whitening properties, it should be used cautiously. Dilute it with water, and use it as a rinse, but avoid using it regularly to protect enamel.
- **Fruits:** Certain fruits, like strawberries and pineapples, contain organic acids that may lighten teeth. Mashing strawberries and mixing them with baking soda can create a natural whitening paste.

### Safety Tips for Whitening

While achieving a whiter smile is desirable, safety should always come first. Here are a few key safety tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consultation:** Whether you're using professional or at-home products, consult a dentist to ensure your teeth are healthy enough for whitening.
- **Follow Instructions:** Always adhere to the instructions provided with whitening products. Overusing these products can lead to sensitivity and damage.
- **Monitor Sensitivity:** If you experience discomfort or increased sensitivity during the process, take a break and consult a dentist if symptoms persist.

### Final Thoughts

Achieving a whiter, brighter smile is possible through safe and effective teeth whitening methods. Whether you opt for professional treatments or select over-the-counter products, the key is to prioritize safety and choose the method that suits your lifestyle.

Stay informed about the options available and keep your oral health in mind. With the right approach, you can enjoy the confidence that comes with a sparkling smile.

That was last spring, I think. 

  
Sorry. Rambling. This is hard for me because I don't talk about myself and my problems to anyone.

 

Okay, I'm 51, female, married to ""Neil,"" 51, male, for 30 years. We've been together for 32. 



Yeah, looong time putting up with a LOT. But I'm the type of person who doesn't just give up on people. It isn't that I think I can change someone or ""fix"" them. 



I grew up the youngest in a family of 5 plus mom and dad, all of whom are very judgmental and demand perfection, which is ironic considering they are some of the most flawed people you'd ever meet. When it came to making friends, I didn't want to be like that. 



I had friends on both sides of the track, so-to-speak. I never tried to judge or change them. I was just there for them, and that made me the one everyone wanted to talk to when things at home got tough. I can talk your ear off, but if you need someone to talk to, I'm as quiet as a church mouse and never offer unsolicited advice. 

  
Neil and I met the day of my grandmother's funeral. 



I had been going through a lot of really hard things that included my family and didn't include my family. Good friends moved away and others betrayed me in a bad way. 



The one friend I would have gone to for a shoulder stabbed me in the back when I revealed to her something horrible an ex-boyfriend had done. It was extremely painful to be hurt by her the way she hurt me rather than support me, but I had learned that there are some things that require immediate burning of bridges. That's what I did, which she turned around to turn all of our friends against me. I had no one and then came Neil.

 

I discovered within a few days of meeting him that he was an addict of a few things, including alcohol. 



Again, I never judged and he wasn't the only friend I had who did drugs. I even had a pretty well-known dealer as a friend, even though I never smoked, drank, or did drugs. I never even slept with anyone. He thought it was cute that I would be friends with him, and the fact I was his friend was kind of like a running gag in his circle. Neil and his friends knew of him and how I was the ""angel on his shoulder."" There was nothing between me and that guy ever. I just wasn't the type of person who rejected anyone asking to be my friend. 



Don't say it. I know I was stupid. I know I should have been more picky with people. I know how lucky I was that these people didn't decide to turn on me. Seriously, don't say it. It's one of those ""how TF did I survive my teenage years?!"" moments. Considering my childhood in my house, I guess I was just numb to the dangers. They were just par for the course.

 

Neil was never a gentleman. He was never polite to me or romantic. He wasn't mean, though, and if someone looked at me the wrong way, he looked right back at them in a threatening manner. 



People didn't generally mess with him because of his temper. I was the only one who didn't flinch when he went into what I call a tantrum. I would just look at him like he was an animal at the zoo, observing him for how he behaved. For some reason, it always calmed him down and he would shut up and walk away. 



I knew how to handle that side of him when others mocked him or feared him for it, and he knew how to make me feel like I was wanted and loved when my own family loved reminding me I was nothing more than entertainment for them. I guess that's why two people worlds apart living on two opposite sides of the proverbial track just seemed to fit perfectly. 



It didn't hurt that he loved my dad. They got along so well, it was as if they were biological father and son, even more than my own brother was with my dad. 



Neil's father was a violently abusive cocaine addict who kicked Neil out at 15, leaving Neil to sleep under bridges and sofa surf until he was 19. His mother abandoned him at 7 all alone at home for a week before anyone found him. 



My mom died when I was 11, so my dad was the only parent-figure either of us had.



A couple of years into our dating, Neil proposed. He had been going to welding school, which I paid for, and was considering joining the Navy, which my dad had been in and had shared stories about with Neil a lot. 

  
4 months after we were married, Neil left for boot camp. 



One of the things commanding officers like to say to new recruits is ""If the Navy wanted you to have a wife, we would have issued you one!"" Well, Neil being Neil, the first time he was told that, he replied, ""I was married before I got here. If my wife didn't send me here, you wouldn't have the best damned welder you've ever met."" Room went quiet for a minute before the CO cracked a smirk and went about his business. 

  
From that moment on, everyone he served with and every command he was at knew about me and that I had his back no matter what. We were inseparable. He still wasn't romantic or a gentleman or the soft type, even at home, but he had my back like I had his. 

  
At this point, the only real problem between us was his drinking. It slacked off considerably after boot camp, but over the years, it not only returned to as bad as it had been but got a lot worse. 

  
Every deployment, I would pay off credit cards and any debt we had accumulated together and separately -- his cards and mine. When he would return home, I proudly showed him the books and how things would be easier than it had been living paycheck to paycheck. This, to him, meant more money to buy beer. 

  
When I became pregnant a few years into our marriage, I had been thinking of leaving him. I had talked to my dad, asking if I could stay with him while I saved up from a job I already had waiting for me back home should I need it. 



He was more of a father to Neil than he was a father to me, so his full support went to Neil. He didn't care about the drinking and how I had begun to fear being around Neil. Up till then, Neil hadn't hit me, so that was all that mattered. I didn't go into detail about other things Neil had done, but I had very little confidence that it would matter to my dad if he knew. He insisted I stay with Neil because ""wives belong with their husbands,"" no matter what that meant, apparently. 

  
I found out shortly later after that conversation with my dad that I was pregnant. The bad part about that was I became pregnant a week after that conversation when Neil and I moved again to a new duty station. Had my dad supported my need to leave Neil, I wouldn't have become pregnant and wouldn't have been ""stuck."" I adore my daughter every single day and every single breath she takes, but it still hurts so much that I had a golden opportunity right before she was conceived to be free before things got as bad as they did. 

  
For the next 15 years, his drinking got worse and worse. 



When she was 2, he became violent. I blame that duty station for causing a lot of it because until we moved there, I got along great with everyone from his shop and they respected both of us. At this new place, they seemed to be of the same mindset that women were nothing more than toys and punching bags. Children were even less, like they just didn't exist at all. They influenced Neil more than anyone had ever done, and he became violent and controlling. 

  
My dad had died a few months before we moved to this place, and my family would never have been any help. Honestly, I'm currently writing a potential novel about them and their psychotic incidents, so yeah, they were not the people to run to. 



I had no one to help, no where to go to, and he and his new friends were well aware of this. 

  
He received orders for another state about a year after the worst of it began, so I thought I could leave and figure it out later. I didn't want my daughter growing up in that environment. When I reached out to the Navy for help, I was met with one brick wall after another, just a bunch of men helping him rather than me. 

  
Learning of my reports about him did help, though. He did start to get some help for his drinking and by the time we moved, he had slacked off a lot. He was still an AH but not as much and not as violent. 

  
Every time he would leave on deployment, he would cry and express fear I was going to find someone and leave him while he was gone. I would just assure him I wasn't going anywhere and just made sure I kept in touch while he was gone. 

  
Every time he would come back, he would forget all of it and become a controlling AH again. 

  
He did get better ... again ... and it seemed like he was going back to the way he was after he joined his first ship. His friends became my friends and supported me and we all hung out together. Then we moved and it started back from the AH personality. 

  
My daughter calls Neil a chameleon because of all of his personality changes. He takes on the characteristics of those around him. He even makes up stories to mimic their own, which is why the jerks at that one duty station hated me so much. They would share hurtful stories about their wives, and to fit in, he would make up lies about me. 



The only one from that command who knew he was lying was one of his commanding officers, but that guy wasn't a decent person, himself. I kept my distance from him ... typical reasons I didn't want to be alone with him. 

  
The new duty station would be the last one we were at together as he spent his last year in the Navy in another state on shore duty. My daughter and I were happy there. We were content. It was peaceful, quiet, free from his drama. We didn't have to walk on eggshells every minute. We could breathe. 

  
Then came the lie. He called one day to tell me that since he was retiring, we could no longer live in our house. It was military housing but not on base. That didn't matter, according to him. We couldn't stay there. We knew some people who were retirees that lived in the neighborhood. That was a different circumstance, according to him. We had to move. 



He wanted us to go south. I said hell no! That's where we were from and where his drug-addicted family lived, as well as my psychotic one. Fine, he said. We would compromise and find a middle ground. We did and moved where we are now. 



I found out after all the papers were signed and the house was put back on the list that we could have stayed. He lied. It was too late, though, and we moved to the hellhole where we are now. It isn't a bad place on the outside, but the people are not nice, not safe, and like living in a city of Karens.

  
More than that, we have him here every ... single ... day. And he's back to drinking. 

  
I have had so many conversations with him begging him to stop. The last time he claimed he was quitting, we sat down and he asked me to tell him everything he had ever done to hurt me because of his drinking. I did. He said he couldn't remember a lot of it. I did. He was remorseful and even cried when I told him the worst of it while crying really hard at the memories. He couldn't stop apologizing and swore that he would make it all up to me. 

  
Well, here we are and he couldn't care less about any of it. 

  
He isn't violent like he used to be, but how long will this last? We've been together in this place for 3 years, and his drinking has gotten really bad again. It's a case, 24, in one night about twice a week. Sometimes, he can hold off for a week before drinking, but his temper flairs up if he's in need of it. I'm only waiting at this point for it go back to the violence, and I'm tired of living this way. 

  
I talked him into going to AA for the third time in our marriage. The last time he took it seriously was back at the last station, when we had that long heartfelt conversation. This time, he just doesn't care. 



He goes just to go and doesn't take it seriously. He uses the books they give out as stands for holding up a workbench or whatever he needs for the moment. He lies at meetings and flaunts these stupid color coins as if he's proud of lying to get them. I think the last color I saw was red before he decided even playing games was boring.

  
I don't know what you think of me so far, but here's where I may lose you if you had any sympathy for me at all. 



A couple of months ago, I went through his phone. I don't do this. We both have our phones password protected just because of our jobs, but we both know each others passwords. I have nothing to hide, so I don't care if he looks through mine. Hell! I would LOVE for him to GAF enough to look through mine! For him, he just assumes that since I've always been respectful of his privacy like I am for everyone that I won't go through his phone. 

  
Well, he came inside one day after another night of binge drinking, and he gave me this look I haven't seen since he was going through his violent phase. It scared the hell out of me. He said something I didn't catch, called me a ""piece of shit,"" then went to his room. 

  
Oh, yeah, we don't share the bedroom. I sleep in the living room in a recliner. He doesn't want me in ""his"" room. It's been this way since we moved here. He's hated me and our daughter since we've been back together, as if he resents being with us and our very existence. 



Our daughter sleeps on the sofa in the living room with me because she's always worried he will say something or do something to make me cry, and she wants to be able to get me away from him or call the police if she needs to and I can't do it. She has a good paying job but is afraid of moving and leaving me alone with him. 

  
So yes, after that look and after what he said, I looked at his phone. He went outside during the night to smoke a cigarette, so I quickly looked at his texts. 



He had messaged his boss to tell him I had kicked him out and he was staying at a hotel for the night, that he wouldn't be able to make it to work in the morning. His boss was sympathetic and I could tell this wasn't the first time Neil made up some kind of story about me kicking him out and causing problems for him. His boss was so sorry for the pain Neil was going through, etc... and said he could take the day off to sort through what I was doing to him.

  
I ... was ... livid. As hurt as I was, anger rose to the surface first. I memorized the phone number, reset things on his phone, and hurried out before he came back inside. I wrote the number down and waited to see what would happen the following day. 

  
Neil got up around 9AM, 3 hours after he usually left for work. My daughter was already at work and it was just me in my office. 



I work from home. It's the only job I can do because in the course of our 30 years together, Neil caused certain issues in me and I became unable to get a job outside of my home. I've seen a psychiatrist, who helped me a little, but we moved from that duty station a few months after my treatments began, physical and psychological. I never did get to continue and now, am doing my best to heal again. His return to mental abuse and such stopped me for a while, but I'm trying to do my best to get back to normal. 

  
I didn't talk to Neil but I did go into the kitchen where he was making coffee. I pretended to need water and glanced over at him. He was looking at me with so much hatred, I got scared again. A few minutes later, he was dressed for work and leaving. 



When he came home that afternoon, he was completely different. He was nice again, insisted on washing the dishes, wanted to buy dinner from our favorite restaurant, etc... This is him. This is what he does. Except, that dangerous attitude hasn't been a thing for years. It returning is what prompted me to snoop on his phone. 

  
That night, I messaged his boss. I introduced myself and explained that I never kicked out Neil, that he has a drinking problem and I was aware of him making up lies to miss work and come in late. I explained that on those days, it's because of his drinking the night before. I let him know that Neil drinks and drives, as well. I told him the reason why I'm sharing this is because I need help. I need to know if there is anything the company can do to make him go into rehab or something. 

  
Before it's mentioned, no, he wouldn't be fired over this. I won't say where he works and what his job is, but they would never just fire him. They would never suspend him. He would have to do something akin to ending someone's life for them to do anything to him. I wouldn't have messaged like this if I even suspected I would be putting his career in jeopardy. He's perfectly safe as long as he doesn't do something very serious directly to a superior and the police are involved. 

  
His boss replied that he had thought a few times that Neil's excuses seemed untrue, but as long as Neil did his job as well as he did, he just assumed Neil needed an occasional break and didn't say anything about it. He apologized for what I was going through but said there was nothing the company offered to help in this situation. All he could do was send me referrals to company counseling services but admitted they aren't good services and he believes Neil needs actual psychiatric help. 



He asked if there was a way I could get Neil to go to something like that, and I told him I had begged Neil in the past to go either on his own or as a couple. He refused. He says nothing is wrong with him and any couple's counseling would make him sound like the bad guy and me as a victim. 



He apologized again and said he would keep an eye open from now on and if Neil says or does anything that appears dangerous to himself or us, he would let me know. Sure ... 

  
A few weeks pass after that chat and a hurricane hit. At this time, he was supposedly going to AA. Well, he told me AA was cancelled that Friday of the week the hurricane came. I didn't think so because our area wasn't even hit hard, just random power outages that lasted a few hours. I looked on their website and saw that they were still on for their meeting. They had even posted a note to say specifically that the outages didn't affect their building, so the meeting was still on. 

  
I was a little bold now after looking at Neil's phone, so I looked again. 



This time, he had messaged his sponsor. I had enough time this time to scroll up. There were so many messages to his sponsor about not getting off on time to attend or that I was sick and needed him home or our daughter needed a ride from work ... all the same excuses he was giving his boss about coming in late or missing work (he has never missed work to help us, even when I've gone to the ER twice and our daughter went once). 



His sponsor had messaged him a few times asking if he was okay, asking if he would see him at the meeting because ""I haven't seen you in several weeks,"" etc... 



I got his number and did what I know you're going to hate me for. I messaged him. 

  
I messaged and apologized for possibly breaking some kind of rule or code. I just needed someone to find a way to help me help him.  

  
At this point, I don't even know why I'm doing this. Honestly. I feel like I hate him so much, that he's killed any bit of love that was left in me, but then I keep trying so hard to make this work and to help him. I don't know why. I've had so many opportunities to leave him and I've done nothing but stay in this. I've met men, some he worked with, who tried to have a relationship with me, but I rejected them because ""I'm loyal."" I need love and I need a good man, but I stay in this toxic marriage. I don't know why. 



I'm even doing something as stupid as contacting his sponsor. I know it's stupid or disrespectful or whatever word you want to throw at it. I just feel like he still has a chance and we still have a chance at what we used to have. I get cocky and arrogant when I feel like the universe is trying to destroy it all, so I want to fight back. I don't even think he's worth it anymore, but I can't stop fighting for us. I don't know why but I wish I could stop. 

  
His sponsor and I talked and he was understanding. He wanted to get me in touch with al-anon, but the woman he sent me to never called or wrote back to me. 



No matter. I've tried that group before and they are horrible. They like to label victims as enablers, even those of us begging for help. They make us feel like it's all our fault and the addict is only an addict because of us. I have never once heard anyone leading an al-anon meeting put any blame on the addict, it's always on the family and the addict is our victim. 



The last time I ever tried one, I watched the man leading the group tell a wife still wearing bruises on her face, ""You need to learn when not to speak. He only hurts you when you open your mouth. He's trying to heal and you won't let him, so what do you expect? Quit your job like he asks and you'll stop fighting and he won't need to drink."" I remember the entire room went silent and he ended the group early. 



Maybe it's different for other people, but from what I've seen, al-anon is only there to help addicts keep their victims in check. 



The last time I spoke to anyone about this, which was his sponsor, was two months ago. In that time, Neil informed me that he has no intention of quitting, and if I don't like it, I can leave. He said that he's planning to retire in February, and when he does, he's leaving. He's packing and driving off into the sunset and will never contact me or our daughter. As for our bills, he said, ""You'll figure it out. You're smart. Sell some things. People live under bridges all the time."" 



I tried to talk to him. I tried to bring up our conversation we had when I reminded him of what he did to me. He didn't want to hear it. He told me that if AA taught him anything, it was to not allow others to blame him for what he does when he's drunk, that he's not in control so it isn't his fault. 



I don't know if he's lying or they really did tell him this. With him, it's hard to tell what's a lie, he lies so much. I have heard him tell people an entire story I knew for a fact was made up from beginning to end, and it left me speechless. He always embellished to fit in, but now, it's not just embellishing an existing event. He makes entire events up that were never even possible. I don't know if it's all the years of drinking frying his brain or if it's some psychological issue that's gotten worse. I don't know anymore. 



Here's where the plot twist comes in. I am starting to wonder if I'm wrong in some of this need for him to stop drinking. Even with all of what I just wrote, something is nagging me.

  
Remember that ""seeing things from a million perspectives"" thing? Well, this is that. 

  
Neil works his ass off. He works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, and is always on call if an emergency comes in. It isn't a desk job. It's a sort of construction job that if it doesn't get done properly, will negatively effect thousands of people at once. He's the best at his job and knows it better than even the men who have been at the company for over 25 years. He's really that good. Without him, certain structural catastrophes would worsen and not be fixed properly. 



Neil doesn't go out. He doesn't go to bars, doesn't party, doesn't even go fishing (which is something my daughter always begged for him to do with her but he's refused). He goes to work, comes home, eats, watches TV, goes to bed. Rinse and repeat. 



His bones and muscles are stressed from doing this kind of work for over 30 years (he did the same work before he entered the Navy). He's mentally and physically drained. He wants to retire for good but we are drowning in debt. 



I know that he knows if he hadn't caused the issues I have, I could get a better job and help him pay this debt off. I know that he knows a good portion of this debt is due to his own carelessness and overspending for beer. He even has 3 accounts he doesn't know I know about that he owes a lot on.



Right now, we are even in debt to the IRS because he went on some tirade about taxes and refused to pay last year. Now, they are after us to pay back a huge amount of money. And because of his little stunt, our daughter lost all of her college scholarships and has had to put her education on hold. He knows all of this is his fault, too.



His responsibilities and guilt won't let him quit working. He's tired. All he has energy for is work and home. All he has interest in is drinking and playing a game on his phone. He's 51 and still can't stop working, as badly as his body needs to stop.

  
So here I am wondering if I'm being too harsh to want him to stop drinking. It's all the relaxation he has. 

  
What I can't stop thinking about is how much it hurts me. The smell brings back all the memories. Hearing the bottles brings back all of the memories. I've tried to tell him this but he doesn't care. He gets mad when I say it. 

  
I've tried to distract him from drinking by getting him to play games. We used to play cards all the time, darts, and a few board games. We used to have water gun warfare and play video games. He refuses to do any of that with me now. 

  
He's never taken me out on a date. I'm not even kidding. We never had a honeymoon because we couldn't afford it and had to save for our move out of state for the Navy. I've tried to get him to take a short vacation with his free days on the books so we can spend time together at a hotel on the beach or mountains or somewhere. He refuses because ""he doesn't want to spend so much time around me.""

  
I was researching for one of my novels a few weeks ago and someone contacted me regarding some questions I had about another country. I've never been out of the U.S., so I need to ask people for source material and first-hand experience. 



Long story short, I was once again asked if I would like to see this man in a casual setting, not about work. When I reminded him that I'm married, he asked, ""Happily?"" 



I couldn't help it and started crying. I don't cry in front of people. It was over the phone but to me, it was still exposing my vulnerability to someone. I opened my mouth to say something and all that happened was crying. 



He apologized over and over and promised he wouldn't speak with me again until I needed more help with my research, and then we could keep it to e-mails only. I just agreed and hung up. 



I thought about it for a little while and wondered what Neil would say if he knew. There was a time that he was rabidly jealous and assumed any man within a hundred yards who happened to glance our way was flirting with me. I wondered if he would care now. 



I decided to text him (he doesn't like talking to me) and ask what he would think if I wanted to date someone. I was looking right at him. He was outside smoking a cigarette. He read the text and I saw him give a small laugh. He texted back, ""Do whatever you think you need to do."" Then he went back to playing his app game. 

  
I guess I should have expected that. 



I sent him a suicide note three years ago. It was very clearly a final message. For reasons I can't get into here, I wasn't able to do what I planned because something happened in my daughter's life and she needed me here. It reminded me that I can't leave her, especially with Neil being her only family. What did he do when he received the letter? Only accuse me of suggesting he is a bad father. The only thing I said about him was asking that he be good to our daughter when I was gone. He didn't care about anything else in the letter.

  
About this time, you probably think I'm as stupid as I know I am for still wanting to fight for this marriage. ""The hell you know ... "" and all that, as the saying goes. I guess. 

  
I don't know that my purpose here is. I probably can't take any advice. I haven't heard good advice yet, but then again, it's all come from either men protecting my husband's interest or women who think it's easy to throw away 30 years. I don't know what I'm asking for. Perspectives, yes. I feel like there has to be more someone can say, but I don't know what it is. Maybe knowing more about my life outside of him would help get a better idea about me, but maybe it doesn't matter.

Long story short, I enjoyed a sandwich I apparently misjudged by a shot long enough that I woke up from my following nap on the flix bus with a blood sugar of 40 mg/dL, arrow going down and dizziness, shaking ans irritation going up. Despite knowing better I started my nine hour bus drive home without any sugar since I had way too much at home and it wouldn't be a big deal anyway. Now being in the biggest of deals I tried to convey my situation to the driver to ask when the next opportunity to take things out of the suitcases would arise. Although I was barely able to form a coherent thought, although we stumbled through a conversation in a nonsensical and ungodly mixture of languages, this man I just basically woke up from his nap in the second row seats looked everywhere, asked other passengers, offering me his lunch and offering to immediately stop the bus on the side of the road. Ultimately, he found a box of sugar cubes for coffee and brought them to me with an apple of his as I was already feeling like the bus would soon only need to stop for a hearse. 
Unfortunately, I couldn't give him more than a few cookies I bought as gifts as a thank you, neither do I know whether one can leave five stars for copilots of flixbusses on any rewiew site.
Even though he only spoke little German, less Hungarian and almost no English, and I know nothing beyond 'kurwa' and 'bobr' in Polish he just wanted to help without understanding what the problem really was. It can be frustrating sometimes explaining diabetes to others and it's even harder to ask for help but that's what makes me even more grateful for people like this.

There is no mention who raced it, and that would be kind of cool to know! Maybe I could find a scale model of that car and put it on the glass top. 

The only identifying mark is this FIA barcode which they apparently use to track the tire throughout it's life. Anyone here who has a bright idea on how I could find who used it?

I'm a little apprehensive to post this but I think I've reached my mental limit. Long story short, I've taken over as the DBA for a system that runs the small company I work for. Over the past few months I've been trying to migrate data to PostgreSQL over ODBC. I've managed via Apache Airflow and a bunch of docker containers, to get all the data to import from the production database users use everyday into my PostgreSQL development server and it works... kinda. 

Issue I'm currently faced with is there are 153 Forms, 119 Reports, \~180 Queries and 94 tables and I'm only one person. The big problem when I started was that literally NOWHERE are there proper foreign key constraints and relationships, so whenever a user deletes a records from say a Purchase Order form, it also deletes any record where a foreign field was referenced within it's query. From what I have tested, this happens basically everywhere, but with the large amount of forms and queries, I feel like my only option is to scrap most of the current forms and menu system and start over...? The users I'm dealing with are very ""old school"" and they aren't very receptive to change so it makes updating forms tedious but if that's what needs to be done SO BE IT, lol.

If anyone is available for a consult feel please DM. If you're in the Cleveland, Ohio area as an added bonus as I'll buy you dinner, lunch, coffee for your time!

1hftmk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1hftmk4/how_do_i_quit_a_job/,How do I quit a job?,"So I turned 17 recently and was finally allowed to start searching for jobs. I really wanted to work at a specific café near me so I applied there first (around the end of August) and I didn't hear back so I started applying elsewhere. I ended up getting hired at a clothing store in the mall. After working there for about 2 weeks, the café I had first applied to emailed me back asking if I was still interested. This was in mid october. I interview there and then discuss the possibility of that alternate employment with my manager at the mall. She said she'd keep me on the schedule and just give me less hours and I can pick up shifts whenever, that way I could focus more on the café. 

So things are good and I do end up getting the job at the café at the beginning of November and I apparently had a rocky start. When the café was slow I'd try to get a bit of homework done if there wasn't anything else to do and nobody really said I couldn't until the owner herself was in, but as soon as I was told that, I never brought my homework out again. And then one day I made a drink wrong, and despite it being the only drink I made wrong out of all the drinks I had made, I was taken off the bar. There was also a time where I was sweeping the store but there was customers in and I was being respectful and not sweeping near occupied tables I'd only sweep where there weren't any customers but the owner pulled me aside and told me not to sweep when there was customers in the store and then also in that conversation mentioned how she's not fully sure how things are going to continue/if I'm going to stay employed there due to the drink and the sweeping 

So now I'm ready to prove myself because I really do enjoy working here. My next shift, I'm working with the owner and she's going over some things with me to correct any issues I was having. Customer interactions (it's a small business mainly built on customer interactions), staying busy, things like that. At some point she asks me to sweep and I start sweeping but I'm feeling extremely unwell by this point, dizzy and nauseous and I felt like I was going to pass out. I asked if I could go to the back really quickly and text to find coverage at the mall since I was working there a couple hours later and she told me to finish sweeping first, which is fair so I do that but I'm not sweeping fast enough and get corrected. I text a people to find coverage and the owner comes to the back and asks if I need to go home. I tell her I can stay for the rest of my shift and tough it out because I didn't just want to leave them down one person and she said it was ok because the main reason for working that day was so she could spend some one on one time with me. So I ask if I could leave then because it's getting increasingly more difficult to stand and she tells me to just go but she sounded really annoyed about it. This was last Monday .

Last Wednesday I was again working with the owner, I was doing whatever was asked of me, I was taking orders I was stocking cups and lids I was washing out coffee pots and any other dishes that needed to be washed, I took out the trash and recycling, I swept the floors after closing, making sure to remember the way to sweep she had showed me to sweep faster. We close at 4 and the closing shift goes until 5 however I end up not getting out of there till 5:45 which doesn't look too good for me because it's showing I'm slow even though I did a good amount of the closing tasks myself. During this shift, I am told I'm not on the schedule for the next two weeks while she thinks about what she wants to do. 

Fast forward to yesterday, my friend who also works at this café texts me to ask what's going on and I give them a rundown and I'm informed that apparently my trainers are saying that I wasn't picking up on things fast enough, that they hired me and two other people around the same time and the other two are doing better. My friend says that the owner is most likely giving me a chance to quit on my own because it would look better on future job applications. I want to wait it out and see if they still want me but it's really not looking or sounding too good and I would forever be stuck with wondering if I'm doing well enough and it'd just be a lot. 

This leaves me of the problem of not knowing how to even begin writing that email. I know the idea of what I want to say but I don't know how to say it professionally. I want to bring up how I feel like I wasn't really given a fair shot as I wasn't really trained on bar at all I had to learn by just watching what everyone else was doing, I wasn't told we weren't supposed to sweep when there were customers, I was told to ask as many questions as I needed to and so I did but a lot of them became just double checking I did something right which I'm thinking translated into me not picking things up fast enough.  This would be my first time quitting and I have no clue where to start 

TL;DR working at a café, rocky start, owner took me off the schedule for two weeks to think about my employment, my friend said they were most likely just giving me a chance to quit on my own, I don't know how to do that professionally ",1,1734383335.0,internetparents,2,1.0,False

Does anyone here do an annual life review? I'm coming up on almost 10 years of doing one in some form or fashion. They're super subjective (and there are a ton of guides out there) so my #1 tip is to start making your own template and pulling together what resonates with you the most from the ""standard"" guides.

My other tip is to get outside of your normal environment (e.g. a coffee shop or if you can spare, even going on a solo trip to a cabin/etc. without cell service just to reflect).

One other tip from this past year is with various AI tools now, you can use them to help me talk thru my plans, ask questions, etc. and I've found that help teases out more interesting information that helps me reflect vs just static questions.

Curious what other tips people have if you do annual reviews!",1,1734383240.0,productivity,0,0.67,False

How can I make her go for inpatient treatment? ,"Me (22M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together for almost a year. I really love her—she’s absolutely gorgeous, way out of my league looks-wise, and the sweetest, most supportive person I’ve ever had. My family isn’t great, and she’s been my rock through everything.

That being said, over time, I’ve noticed she has some really weird eating habits. She eats super little, skips meals, and is really picky with food. At first, when I asked her about it, she’d just brush it off, but after she fainted a couple of times, I got mad and demanded to know what was going on. She finally admitted she’s scared of being fat (she’s nowhere close to overweight).

When we went on a trip to Mexico, I was watching her like a hawk, making sure she was eating every few hours, but even then, she’d only eat one small meal a day and drink coffee or energy drinks to keep going. She’s studying full-time, working out, and barely eating. She’s been to the hospital for fainting, and they said she might have an eating disorder. Even then, she refused food in the hospital. I told her she has to get help, but she says she doesn’t want to. I gave her an ultimatum—either she gets treatment or we break up.

She’s a high achiever, always excelling at uni, but it’s like the pressure is driving her into a spiral. She’ll study 20 hours a day for weeks, barely eat or sleep, ace her exams, and then immediately dive into nonstop partying, drinking. It’s like she’s constantly going back and forth between extremes, and she’s just… not okay. She’s not doing hard drugs but she’s smoking a lot of weed. And i mean a lot. She says it helps her to „calm down”. She also tried blow a few times but said she didn’t like it however i’m kinda scared she will do it again to lose weight or something. I heard about girls doing this to eat less and im scared about it. 


A few weeks ago, she hit rock bottom—she spent days in bed, crying, refusing to eat, saying she’s fat, and I literally had to force her to eat some bread. I brought up treatment again, and she said she’d do it “for me,” but I honestly think she needs inpatient treatment, not just a psychologist. She’s too far gone for outpatient to work, in my opinion.

Last week we had sex and she got a nose bleed. Mid fuck there was a blood everywhere. Honestly I got extremely scared. It happened a few times before but she said it’s because of the heating or something. Now she said it’s from stress and not eating. 
She told me she knows there is a problem, and she says will try her best to get better but she says she can’t do it on her own. 

I love her to death, but I need her to get better. She’s sweet, smart, and amazing, and I owe her so much for everything she’s done for me. I just want to help her. How do I convince her to go to inpatient treatment? I don’t want her to be scared, so can someone explain what these places are like? What happens there? What are the rules? Can I visit her? I want to be prepared so I can explain it all to her and help her feel less overwhelmed.

Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

Hey all, I hope you’re all doing well with your recoveries, I thought I owed you all an update.

First of all, thank you so much to everyone who took the time to answer my questions of just be a part of this community and answer questions of others. I’ve referenced this subreddit countless times.

Update - cautiously optimistic that I’m through the acute phase. At least things don’t seem to be getting any worse. The neurological / brain related stuff wore off prettt quickly after I started using Co Q-10, and I’ve mostly been dealing with tendon issues.

Because of prior existing tendonosis in my shoulders and knee, I kind kept up with me rehab, which was mostly stretching and isometrics. I have no way to definitely say that this helped, but I think it did play a huge part.

My diet didn’t change much, I’ve cut down on the caffeine a bit, not for any flox related reason, but I resumed drinking coffee and tea at times with no issue - though coffee and soda were an issue the first couple of weeks. No issue with alcohol.

I have been on an anti inflammatory diet for about a month now - no dairy, no corn, no soy, no gluten, no wheat. I don’t know if this did much for the floxing, but I think it has helped with other normal issues that I’ve had (which one tends to have by the time they’re in their late 30s). One thing I have learned here though is the importance of having a healthy gut in dealing with systematic inflammation. And overall just boosting the body’s immune system, which is even more important to decrease instances of needing antibiotics as frequently as might otherwise be needed.

Right now im mostly learning about what meds I can and can’t use anymore. E.g. had an issue with augmenting a few weeks back, caused a flare up. I was at the dentist earlier today and got some sort of anesthetic, which I’m assuming contained epinephrine because my heart was racing for a few seconds - overall my body is tolerating this better than the augmentin so far.

I have been trying to spread the word amongst family and friends, and even to a doctor. At least one person heeded my advice when she was prescribed cipro ear drops. But unfortunately, most people, including the doctor are dismissive. It seems that for people to understand what a hazard it can be, they themselves need to be floxed 😔. 

So for anyone new here reading this, just know that I was in despair after I got floxed and was just assuming the worst, you’re not alone. This is a great community. The information that many have codified has been super helpful. Please continue to spread the word about these drugs. I’d say I’m mostly back to my activities prefloxing - actually maybe doing slightly better in that regard because I continued my rehab, but I’m not totally without pain or limitations. Hopefully things will improve from here until I get back to 100%.

Vitamins that helped: hyarulonic acid (boy did this help), Co Q-10 (very important especially with my emotional state), vitamins C, D, B-complex, Type 2 collagen, electrolytes.

Vitamins that I’m not sure had much of an effect: NAD+, NAC, PQQ (though to be fair, I guess I won’t know until I stop taking them, if they had an effect or not. And everyone is different, what worked for me (or didn’t) might not work for you (or will).",2,1734382740.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

1hft512,https://www.reddit.com/r/POIS/comments/1hft512/fix_for_abstinenceinduced_stress_and_anxiety/,Fix for Abstinence-Induced Stress and Anxiety.,"This post is dedicated to a seemingly rare type of pois that I've only seen briefly mentioned a handful of times here.

This nightmarish variant has taken the last 2,5 years of my life by making it impossible to get out of the pois state even for a brief period. It messed me up psychologically by not letting me build up abstinence discipline, punishing me for doing the right thing, and keeping me at the lowest of lows at all times.

It's characterized by a sudden onset of extreme stress, anxiety, sensory overload, short-term memory, and spatial awareness dysfunction as effect of abstinence. Yes, the symptoms get worse the longer you abstain.

If you don't experience anything like this and abstinence works like a charm, there might not be any value in this post for you, but if you do, I found a fix and possibly even an explanation.



**First a little backstory.**

in 2021 i found out my symptoms are linked to ejaculation and i immediately began practising abstinence religiously. It worked consistently for the first few months, and my quality of life improved immensely. 

After a few months in I noticed the effects of abstinence had gotten weaker and it got more and more difficult to reach mental clarity.

After a year I was completely debilitated. Around 3-4 days into abstinence i woke up with extreme anxiety, stress, and sensory overload. completely unable to complete any task, do any chores, or fulfill the simplest responsibility. Sounds were too loud, light too bright, and the brain so overstimulated stringing the simplest thoughts or recalling recent events was utterly impossible. Paradoxically, my brain on day \~3 of abstinence felt better than on day \~4 of abstinence, and ejaculation completely relieved this stress and anxiety. This messed me up in many ways. I was trying to stay consistent with abstinence but knowing that i could make this hellish state go away immediately with a quick O tore me up. i'd nut for it to go away just to feel like a lost cause the next day and this cycle went on for 2.5 years. I'm skimming over details here to keep the post short. 

**If you experience anything similar to this, listen up.**

I'm not a doc and I'm nowhere near as knowledgable as some people here are but I've only met a handful of poisers experiencing this and none of them had any clue why it happens so I ran my own trials and came up with this theory:

So, people know cortisol as ""the stress hormone"". While it does cause stress, stressing you out is not its primary function. **Immune regulation and inflammation control are!** that's what corticosteroids are, they mimic the effects of cortisol in the body lowering inflammation. 

In some cases, when chronic inflammation is present for a long time, the HPA axis can become dysregulated, leading to an abnormal spike in cortisol as a response to stress. stress in this case being whatever happens in our bodies after ejaculation.

From my experience, this makes a lot of sense. The \~3 days after ejaculation (before the anxiety attack) I feel very weak, lethargic, tired, and brain-fogged, but I do not experience any stress or sensory overload. I'm actually very calm somewhat relaxed. This isn't the case for regular poisers and it wasn't the case for me in the first months of abstinence.



**The next step of the puzzle is acetylcholine.**

There's a lot of talk about acetylcholine in the community recently but i haven't seen anyone mention the fact that **acetylcholine counteracts the stress response from cortisol!**

As a poiser you have high cortisol as you have loads of inflammation in your body, but that doesn't mean you have to be a shaky mess for all this time.

Acetylcholine is synthesised from choline but it's a bit more nuanced than just ingesting choline. I ate 5-10 eggs per day (the best source of choline) throughout all these years and I still experienced debilitating stress.

For Choline to be synthesized into acetylcholine you need choline acetyltransferase, and for choline acetyltransferase you need AcetylCoa.

If your gut microbiome and/or metabolism is messed up (which they are as a result of pois) all of the aforementioned processes will be disrupted, so no matter how much choline you take in, you won't have enough acetylcholine.

On top of that, **cortisol depletes acetylcholine and ejaculation depletes choline!**

Now, in healthy men, the choline gets somehow recycled after ejaculation. There have been some theories of a dysfunction of that process in poisers. I haven't gone down that rabbit hole yet.

**So basically my theory is**: Dysregulated HPA axis causes a delayed sudden spike in cortisol. This spike coupled with poor acetylcholine synthesis causes a sudden drop in acetylcholine exacerbating the stress response from cortisol. This also explains why ejaculating causes immediate relief - O lowers cortisol and releases prolactin and estrogen which modulate the HPA axis.

**So what do?**

I'm not done running my trials, I still have a few supplements to try and I will update this post when I have.

I can tell you what works for me right now, allowing me to just continue abstaining as normal and keeping my stress and overstimulation at a manageable level:



**Cholinergic Supps:**

CDP-Choline (Citicoline) - highly bio-available source of choline, i take 500mg/day split in 2 doses. I might increase the dose in later trials.



Alpha-GPC - NOT RECOMMENDED. I took it alongside CDP. it causes anxiety and a stabbing pain in the heart especially if you drink coffee. You'll see this supp mentioned if you choose to research acetylcholine and might be tempted by its properties like promoting growth hormone production. Please stay away.



Sunflower Lecithin - Rich source of choline. Improves semen quality and testicular health. I replaced alpha-gpc with it a few days ago and it helped a lot! still trying to figure out the right dosage, will update later



**Vitamins:**



Vitamin B1 - For the sake of this trial i dropped my B-complex and bought a simple B1 Thiamin 100mg supp from NOW. Vit B1 is crucial for acetylcholine synthesis. I'm currently taking 200mg per day split in 2 doses alongside my CDP-choline (morning and evening). B1 is one of those vitamins that has different effects depending on the dose so play around with the doses and see how it makes you feel. 200mg seems to be a relatively high dose and i haven't been taking it for that long. I'm also planning to try more bio-available forms of B1 like TTFD but it's hard to get where I live. Will update later.



Vitamin E - I'm not sure if E is directly connected to the whole choline -> acetylcholine pathway but i've seen great improvements with it so i'm putting it out there. Very important to note: vit E is actually 8 vitamins in one, when buying a vit E supp make sure its a ""full spectrum"" or ""complete"" vitamin E as 99% of vit E supplements have either 1 or 4 of the 8 necessary parts. 



**Supps I'll try and report on in the coming weeks:**



Vit B5 - Even more crucial for acetylcholine production than B1 as it's directly responsible for acetylCoA synthesis. This is next on my shopping list.



Coluracetam - synthetic nootropic that greatly increases choline uptake by ""modulating the function of CHT-1, a membrane-bound protein responsible for the active transport of choline into cholinergic neurons"". Whatever that means.



That's all i have for now. Quite a long post for something this rare, but like I said, this has taken years of my life and if there's a chance it might help at least one poiser get back on their feet, it's definitely worth sharing. I'll update the list with more supplements and my recommendations.",7,1734382129.0,POIS,0,1.0,False

Somehow African jazz made its way into my Spotify algorithm … and I am not at all mad about it. I spent part of my weekend listening to recommended songs, and slowly starting to cultivate a new playlist dedicated solely to this amazing music. Apparently I like jazz now - this is new lol. I get that African jazz is different from the traditional American jazz that I'm used to, but are they really that different? Any music majors wanna jump in? Haha - j/k there's no one else here 🤷‍♀️

I wonder what I clicked on or looked at to bring this into my musical algorithm though. According to Spotify I played 3,495 different songs and 2,193 different artists in 2024, but I don't think any of the genres even bordered on African jazz. Plus, those counts should both be higher now that I've found this great music. I don't even care that I don't understand the lyrics, music is felt and understood in a much different way - it's universal. There's one song “Tezeta” by a guy named Mahmoud Ahmed. I don't understand a lick of it, but I felt it - something in it was familiar. So I looked up the lyrics and got a bit of a translation, and despite the song sounding upbeat and being fun to dance to, it's about heartbreak, and Tezeta (Tizita) means memory. 

*”Tinan’tenan t’so, zaren tentereso 
Kenegem teweso, amna’nem adeso 
Yemetal tizita gwazun agbesbeso


Outdoing yesterday, shouldering on today, 
Borrowing from tomorrow, renewing yesteryears, 
Comes tizita (memory) hauling possessions”* 

How beautiful is that lyric? 🥹 

Anyshit, I've decided not to start sharing these publicly again. I have my main account, and I don't want to use it for diary entries - I'm going to keep that account separate from all of this, and as secret as I possibly can. I've posted a couple of selfies there but I'm not linking that account to FB or anything like I've done in the past. And I won't be sharing any inappropriate pics or anything like that anymore either. I have to realize that being an overtly sexual woman has not worked out well for me. Maybe I'll become asexual? I don't even want to be touched by anyone. I don't even want to go out anymore, I just get drunk and make bad decisions when I do. It's funny, according to him every dude in this town wants to fuck me or be with me. But he was the only one I ever wanted, and well thanks to men like him, and the others from my past that just used or abused me, they can all get bent. I'm done trying. I'm done putting myself out there - this was just too much for me to heal from. 

I cried a literal shitton this weekend, it had been quite a while since I cried that hard, or for that long. I've already sobbed a few times today, I'm sure it'll be like this for a long, long time again. I guess it has to just be ok, I've got tissues for my nose and Vaseline, also for my nose because even the softest tissues offend when the skin is already raw. I made mistakes this weekend and kept trying to reach him. Sometimes I wish I could just delete his number or block him but I can't and it's not even because of what if anymore, my heart and spirit are too broken to hope.  

Therapy tells me I can't shut all of the world out, and that's why I do this. That's why I have Reddit and post my face sometimes. I like that I can have small and short connections with people and nothing else. I like that I don't have to actually interact with anyone, because I have found, more than anything, all people do is drain me. But living this way also means I get to dictate how I'm seen, and I think maybe this is the best/easiest way for me to try and shed the skin that I'm in. I have given up completely on love. That isn't being dramatic, it is a fact. It's not that I don't believe in it - I have just given up believing love is out there for me. 

You know what I've been enjoying lately? Cooking … I don't typically enjoy cooking. I've always enjoyed baking but cooking always felt more like a chore. I don't know why that's changed. It's not like I'm cooking for less people, I've been cooking for one for years. Weird. Ah well, I've also really been enjoying buying other people's junk 😅 I never used to do the thrifting/second hand thing, and I don't know why I am now, but I clearly am. I find neat stuff that I just have to have every time I go. Weird. I want to continue building out my musical library - and I want to start expanding my literary library lol. That's fun to say, it has an interesting mouth feel ha, literary library. 

Anywhen, my retired mentor is going to be in town with his wife today, I'm going to meet them for coffee, it will be nice to see them. I still talk to my mentor periodically, despite his being retired, he's very graciously offered to help me through some of the difficulties of this position. I've been very appreciative of his continued assistance. It's hard to fill the shoes of someone who had 40 plus years of experience when I don't even have 20 yet lol. But I'm doing alright. It's a lot of stress though, and I'm honestly not sure if the stress level is going to be maintainable for me. Time will tell - but I have to be very cognizant of that because I can't handle things the way I used to be able to and I need to be sure that I put myself before the job. 

And I do. I put myself first, now and always. Because no one else ever has … and now it's something I could never allow myself to ask.

1hft3ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1hft3ia/advice_needed_on_toxic_family_dynamics_and/,Advice Needed on Toxic Family Dynamics and Setting Boundaries ,"Hey everyone, this is going to be a long post, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read part of my story. Thank you in advance.

I’m in a very difficult situation with my family, particularly with my brother and his girlfriend, Anna. I feel trapped in a toxic dynamic where my needs are ignored, and my health is being disregarded. I’m looking for advice on how to handle it, especially with my dad.

Here’s some context:

I have type 1 diabetes, heart problems, and anemia. My dad, who has one of the best medical aids in South Africa, refuses to help me with my medical aid. I can pay him back, but the coverage I need is far beyond what I can afford on my own. He has never once asked about my health or how my diabetes is doing, even though I’ve had these conditions for years. He’s never supported me or my brother in anything we’ve done. He also believes that the more you gift him, the more love and support he’ll give you. There’s a lot more to say about my dad, but I’ll focus on what’s bothering me right now.

So, with my dad giving a lot of excuses for not adding me to his medical aid, he is, however, paying for my brother’s girlfriend (Anna)’s medical aid, especially now that they have a baby. I understand supporting a new family is important, but it feels incredibly unfair that my chronic health issues are overlooked.

My brother has been physically abusive in the past. On one occasion, when I yelled at him for yelling at my mom and breaking things, he picked me up by the throat. Another time, when he had my phone for hours, he got angry when I asked for it back and threw it on the floor.

I’ve tried to communicate with my brother, but he just dismisses my feelings. When I try to explain myself or set boundaries, he gets angry, and things escalate quickly.

The situation with Anna complicates things further. I’ve always tried to be kind and helpful to her. I’ve brought her coffee in bed, bought her snacks when I bought some for myself, and even let her sleep in my bed when she and my brother were fighting because I believed she needed space. I’ve always done my best to support her, but when my brother and I have an argument, Anna always inserts herself, even though it’s between me and my brother.

For example, Anna gave birth on November 3rd, and on November 5th, while I was washing dishes, I mentioned that I was tired. I had been awake for two days because they had recently moved in with us, and their puppy wasn’t used to sleeping with others, which kept me awake. Additionally, my brother kept calling me in the early hours of the morning to update me on things. So, I was exhausted. When I said I was tired, my brother immediately told me, “Don’t let Anna hear you.”

I didn’t understand why I couldn’t express being tired, so I asked him, “What makes Anna better than anyone else? Why can’t I say I’m tired in front of her?” We have a history where I’m not allowed to express certain things around Anna. For instance, one time I was hanging clothes, and my brother came to the back door, asking for me. When I told him to come over, he got upset and said, “I don’t want Anna to f*** know what I’m about to say,” and then hit the wall.

But anyway back to what happened on the 5th, Not knowing Anna was walking towards the kitchen from the hallway, I got frustrated and asked, “Why can’t I express certain things in front of her? What makes her better(not thinking she thinks she's better, but why does my brother think that way).” Anna overheard this while walking from the hallway to the kitchen, and she stormed over, kinda almost pushed me aside, and told me, “Go lay down. You’re tired,” in a babyish voice.

My brother then started calling me names, and I tried to explain myself, but Anna didn’t want to listen. My brother kept insulting me, and when I told him to stop, he wouldn’t. I got increasingly anxious and started raising my voice. That’s when Anna accused me of not caring about my nephew because I was loud. She even threatened me with the idea that I wouldn’t be allowed to be part of my nephew’s life anymore while my brother threatened me with my life. 

So, I snapped and said, “F*** you, too, Anna,"" and told her, that, If she wants to spite me with my nephew and she didn’t want me in his life, then I wouldn’t be, until he’s old enough to understand.

Then, my brother threw a lit cigarette in my face. And again, he said he would unalive me. At that point, I realized they weren’t going to listen to my side of things, and it wasn’t worth continuing the argument. They were set on their own version of events, and nothing I said was going to change that. I left to calm down and called my dad. He sided with my brother and said I was at fault.

Everything happened while I was on a phone call with my fiancée, who is currently in South Korea for work. He knows what happened, and I explained it to my mom. A few days later, when I asked my mom if my nephew was okay because he had been crying, Anna stormed out of the room, angry that I even asked.

My mom is on my side because she understands how my brother is, and she’s seen how Anna treats me. She’s tried everything to get him to change, but he refuses. She knows it’s not just me, and she understands how tired I am. She’s a nurse, so she understands what I’m going through. She even told my brother to move out in January. She’s giving him time to get a job. The other thing is, I arranged an interview for my brother, but Anna decided he shouldn’t go because she didn’t want to be alone with us, and she wanted him to help take care of my nephew while she’s on unpaid leave. She still doesn’t appreciate that my fiancée and mom have been paying for the roof over their heads for three months and for all their food and other necessities like shampoo. She won’t even say thank you to my mom. She says thank you to my brother but refuses to let him go for an interview in a country where people would kill for a job.

I know it may sound like I’m blaming others all the time, but I do recognize that I get overwhelmed sometimes. When you pour fire on fire, it just gets worse. Sometimes I can’t help it, and this has been happening for 17 years. It’s not that I’m calling names; I just try to explain myself or set boundaries, and then everything escalates. Whenever I ask my brother what I’ve done to deserve this, he can never answer. The only thing he says is that I “nag” a lot. But I don’t think it’s nagging when I ask for basic things like help. For example, when you make food, just close the bread to prevent it from getting hard or letting flies get on it, or put the cheese back in the bag instead of leaving it half-open in the fridge, making it hard. These are normal things I ask for because it costs a lot of money to keep replacing items like cheese because they weren’t stored properly. But he says I’m nagging and treating him like a child. I just feel that if he followed the simple things my mom taught him, no one would need to remind him. It’s just normal.

I really need advice on how to handle this situation and protect my mental and emotional health.",1,1734382027.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

The best part of hosting? The people. From travelers passing through to long-term guests, I’ve built incredible relationships, including my two best friends, Jerry and Elke, who started as guests in my Airbnb. Hosting isn’t just about accommodations — it’s about connection.

# 2. Learn Airbnb Policies Early

One of my first challenges as a host was navigating tricky situations like late checkouts and cleaning disputes. My advice? Familiarize yourself with [Airbnb’s policie](https://chatgpt.com/c/6758fa7d-783c-8009-aec3-3a43dc1e025d#:~:text=Center%3A%20Hosting-,Basics,-Link%20this%20to)s from the start. Knowing how to handle these situations proactively will save you stress.

# 3. Your Space Doesn’t Have to Be a Tourist Destination

My Airbnb isn’t in a major city or tourist hub. Most of my guests stay while passing through to nearby universities or the capital. What makes my space unique? My dog, cat, and lush collection of houseplants. Guests frequently mention how much they love these personal touches in their reviews. Find what makes your space special and highlight it.

# 4. Long-Term Guests = Less Work

I’ve hosted guests for just a day and others for over a year. Long-term stays are my favorite because they mean fewer turnovers, fewer cleanings, and more time to build relationships. If you’re just starting out, consider offering discounts for longer stays — it’s a win-win for both you and your guests. Or you can use managment companies like [TurnoverBnb](https://turnoverbnb.com/) for simplicity!

# 5. Communication Is Key

Overcommunicate! Guests appreciate [clear instructions, detailed house rules, and proactive updates](https://chatgpt.com/c/6758fa7d-783c-8009-aec3-3a43dc1e025d#:~:text=Use%20Airbnb%E2%80%99s%20Automated-,Messaging,-Tools%0ALink%20this). Whether it’s a guide for check-in or tips on using the coffee maker, providing extra detail ensures a smooth experience for everyone. Happy guests leave great reviews, which boost your bookings.

# 6. Invest in Your Airbnb Listing

Your listing is your storefront. High-quality photos and a compelling description are essential for attracting guests. Use natural light to take pictures, and highlight unique features of your space, whether it’s cozy décor, pet-friendly policies, or proximity to local attractions. Make your listing stand out in a sea of options.

# 7. Reviews Matter — Both Ways

Guests review you, and you review them. Leaving thoughtful, honest feedback encourages great guest behavior and helps future hosts. If a review ever concerns you, Airbnb’s support team is there to help mediate.

# 8. Expect the Unexpected

From plumbing emergencies to last-minute cancellations, hosting is unpredictable. Always have an emergency fund for repairs and a backup plan for unexpected situations. Flexibility is key to thriving as a host.

# 9. Personal Touches Make a Big Difference

Small gestures go a long way. A handwritten welcome note, fresh flowers, or local snacks can turn a good stay into a memorable one. These personal touches help you stand out and earn glowing reviews.

# 10. Just Start

If you’re overwhelmed by the idea of hosting, take the leap. You don’t need to have everything perfect at first. Communication and kindness go a long way, and you’ll improve with every guest. The rewards of hosting — from financial independence to meaningful connections — are worth it.

# Why Hosting on Airbnb is Life-Changing

Hosting has allowed me to meet incredible people, gain financial independence, and transform how I think about hospitality. Whether you’re looking to earn extra income, connect with travelers, or start a side hustle, Airbnb hosting can be your next great adventure.

1hfsz2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1hfsz2l/advice_needed_on_toxic_family_dynamics_and/,Advice Needed on Toxic Family Dynamics and Setting Boundaries ,"Hey everyone, this is going to be a long post, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read part of my story. Thank you in advance.

I’m in a very difficult situation with my family, particularly with my brother and his girlfriend, Anna. I feel trapped in a toxic dynamic where my needs are ignored, and my health is being disregarded. I’m looking for advice on how to handle it, especially with my dad.

Here’s some context:

I have type 1 diabetes, heart problems, and anemia. My dad, who has one of the best medical aids in South Africa, refuses to help me with my medical aid. I can pay him back, but the coverage I need is far beyond what I can afford on my own. He has never once asked about my health or how my diabetes is doing, even though I’ve had these conditions for years. He’s never supported me or my brother in anything we’ve done. He also believes that the more you gift him, the more love and support he’ll give you. There’s a lot more to say about my dad, but I’ll focus on what’s bothering me right now.

So, with my dad giving a lot of excuses for not adding me to his medical aid, he is, however, paying for my brother’s girlfriend (Anna)’s medical aid, especially now that they have a baby. I understand supporting a new family is important, but it feels incredibly unfair that my chronic health issues are overlooked.

My brother has been physically abusive in the past. On one occasion, when I yelled at him for yelling at my mom and breaking things, he picked me up by the throat. Another time, when he had my phone for hours, he got angry when I asked for it back and threw it on the floor.

I’ve tried to communicate with my brother, but he just dismisses my feelings. When I try to explain myself or set boundaries, he gets angry, and things escalate quickly.

The situation with Anna complicates things further. I’ve always tried to be kind and helpful to her. I’ve brought her coffee in bed, bought her snacks when I bought some for myself, and even let her sleep in my bed when she and my brother were fighting because I believed she needed space. I’ve always done my best to support her, but when my brother and I have an argument, Anna always inserts herself, even though it’s between me and my brother.

For example, Anna gave birth on November 3rd, and on November 5th, while I was washing dishes, I mentioned that I was tired. I had been awake for two days because they had recently moved in with us, and their puppy wasn’t used to sleeping with others, which kept me awake. Additionally, my brother kept calling me in the early hours of the morning to update me on things. So, I was exhausted. When I said I was tired, my brother immediately told me, “Don’t let Anna hear you.”

I didn’t understand why I couldn’t express being tired, so I asked him, “What makes Anna better than anyone else? Why can’t I say I’m tired in front of her?” We have a history where I’m not allowed to express certain things around Anna. For instance, one time I was hanging clothes, and my brother came to the back door, asking for me. When I told him to come over, he got upset and said, “I don’t want Anna to f*** know what I’m about to say,” and then hit the wall.

But anyway back to what happened on the 5th, Not knowing Anna was walking towards the kitchen from the hallway, I got frustrated and asked, “Why can’t I express certain things in front of her? What makes her better(not thinking she thinks she's better, but why does my brother think that way).” Anna overheard this while walking from the hallway to the kitchen, and she stormed over, kinda almost pushed me aside, and told me, “Go lay down. You’re tired,” in a babyish voice.

My brother then started calling me names, and I tried to explain myself, but Anna didn’t want to listen. My brother kept insulting me, and when I told him to stop, he wouldn’t. I got increasingly anxious and started raising my voice. That’s when Anna accused me of not caring about my nephew because I was loud. She even threatened me with the idea that I wouldn’t be allowed to be part of my nephew’s life anymore while my brother threatened me with my life. 

So, I snapped and said, “F*** you, too, Anna,"" and told her, that, If she wants to spite me with my nephew and she didn’t want me in his life, then I wouldn’t be, until he’s old enough to understand.

Then, my brother threw a lit cigarette in my face. And again, he said he would unalive me. At that point, I realized they weren’t going to listen to my side of things, and it wasn’t worth continuing the argument. They were set on their own version of events, and nothing I said was going to change that. I left to calm down and called my dad. He sided with my brother and said I was at fault.

Everything happened while I was on a phone call with my fiancée, who is currently in South Korea for work. He knows what happened, and I explained it to my mom. A few days later, when I asked my mom if my nephew was okay because he had been crying, Anna stormed out of the room, angry that I even asked.

My mom is on my side because she understands how my brother is, and she’s seen how Anna treats me. She’s tried everything to get him to change, but he refuses. She knows it’s not just me, and she understands how tired I am. She’s a nurse, so she understands what I’m going through. She even told my brother to move out in January. She’s giving him time to get a job. The other thing is, I arranged an interview for my brother, but Anna decided he shouldn’t go because she didn’t want to be alone with us, and she wanted him to help take care of my nephew while she’s on unpaid leave. She still doesn’t appreciate that my fiancée and mom have been paying for the roof over their heads for three months and for all their food and other necessities like shampoo. She won’t even say thank you to my mom. She says thank you to my brother but refuses to let him go for an interview in a country where people would kill for a job.

I know it may sound like I’m blaming others all the time, but I do recognize that I get overwhelmed sometimes. When you pour fire on fire, it just gets worse. Sometimes I can’t help it, and this has been happening for 17 years. It’s not that I’m calling names; I just try to explain myself or set boundaries, and then everything escalates. Whenever I ask my brother what I’ve done to deserve this, he can never answer. The only thing he says is that I “nag” a lot. But I don’t think it’s nagging when I ask for basic things like help. For example, when you make food, just close the bread to prevent it from getting hard or letting flies get on it, or put the cheese back in the bag instead of leaving it half-open in the fridge, making it hard. These are normal things I ask for because it costs a lot of money to keep replacing items like cheese because they weren’t stored properly. But he says I’m nagging and treating him like a child. I just feel that if he followed the simple things my mom taught him, no one would need to remind him. It’s just normal.

I really need advice on how to handle this situation and protect my mental and emotional health.",1,1734381716.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

I work with my sister and we usually uber to get back home , she ordered the uber the guys rating was 4.94 or something along those lines. He doesn’t pull up all the way into the parking lot where the pickup is pinpointed at , mind you it was about 20 degrees out and windy as hell.Soon as we get in he ignored my sister saying hi , cool maybe not in the mood or doesn’t like speaking with riders , understandable. He had a hoodie on (the actual hood on his head) which would make sense if he didn’t have a workin heater in the car but it was nice and toasty in there. He proceeds to go the wrong direction my route usually takes us, actually have never gone this way EVER and I’ve been going to my house from my job almost 2 years now . We’re at a stop light the guys seatbelt alarm keeps going off he turns around and utters “EY U GUYS GOT UR SEATBELTS ON?” like a drunk father speaking to his young kids ( trust me I would know from past experiences ) granted me and my sister are in our very early 20s and he’s up there id say around 40’s so I found this kind of funny to be honest . We’re waiting for the light and he purposefully backs up his car and looks over at the van next to us and it’s some Arabic lady playin Arabic music or something and he looks at her and laughs “he heee he” don’t know what that was about . Buddy proceeds to drink from a glass bottle covered in a paper bag I’m talking trying to get a last drop out of it 12-6 position on the bottle here . I’m usually just in my own world in uber rides so I just thought he had a coffee or something he was drinking my sister messages me in the car “this dude weird asl” and we keep goin and he says “hate comin this way” he lights up an old cigarette or something takes one puff and throws it out the window, and this whole time he’s sniffing crazy like he just did a line before we got in or something speeding every corner every small street just speeding speeding speeding we get around my house and the guy tried to get a charger out of his glove compartment for about 2 minutes straight he’s having some torubles it’s looking like (while driving the whole time by the way) funny enough he let that one popular Billie Eilish song play out I found it pretty funny atleast. Anyways at the time I didn’t think much of the ride other than this guy is a very bad driver but now looking back we could’ve very well got in an accident that night I’m wondering how some of you would have handled this situation as I’m a very non confrontational person and feel as though anything I would’ve done there would have made the situation worse , sorry for the extremely long story btw for anyone who did read all the way through lol",1,1734381594.0,uber,0,1.0,False

I have been trying to look for hong kong/cantonese style cha chaan teng retaurants in Auckland lately that really capture the taste and affordability that you can get back in HK.

I have found a number of the older ones that have been in auckland for 20+ years to have the authentic taste and similar affordability to the stuff you would get in HK

unfortunately most of the newer ones that have popped up are a bit overpriced, taste a bit funny (in terms of food safety and quality):  
I noticed there is a trend where the newer restaurants that don't speak cantonese have likely more mainland owners/cooks that fail to capture the authentic taste, affordability or health safety standards.

I am wondering what are your thoughts on this and whether you can help me sort out your favourite ones into the following categories:

1. Old and Good
2. New and Good
3. Old and Bad
4. New and Bad

Here are some of my additions:

1. Old and Good

Dragon's Gourmet 龍華茶餐廳 (epsom) - borscht soup is lovely as well as the baked rice/spaghetti

Muse Cafe 心思港式茶餐厅 (newmarket) - great satay beef rice and affordable

2. New and Good

Canto Canto (newmarket) - noodle soups and salt and pepper pork/shrimp is delicious, fried icecream is tasty and fair portion though melts a bit too fast, best lemon tea and yin yeung (half tea and coffee) in auckland for price and taste imo

4. New and Bad  
Kowloon Cafe (CBD) - consistently rotten chicken steak which caused vomiting within 10 minutes.

Top Tea Restaurant (Newmarket) - Never went but just looking at the photos on uber eats seem really flavourless with the only dish that looks in good is beef stir fried hor fun",8,1734381404.0,aucklandeats,11,0.7,False

The room behind the spaces you see in the images is a bathroom, so I think I can tap into the plumbing... Any suggestions for how to best organize/design this space? I know it’s tight, but I’d love  make it useable with a sink, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster oven, etc.

I’m going to post this in a few other communities to cast a wide net, but any and all advice, ideas, suggestions, etc. are welcome! Thanks!!",1,1734381244.0,DesignMyRoom,3,1.0,False

1hfsniv,https://i.redd.it/ftba1x1xs97e1.jpeg,cat is eating poop from the litter box ,"TLDR: My male, neutered, cat is eating his poop from the litter box, they eat raw and I've added more/new proteins, I feel I'm checking all the boxes and unsure what's missing.

Hey everyone! Looking for some guidance here. My babies are 5 months old (07/12/2024) my grey female Briar Rose and my black male Lucien. 

I started a raw diet Nov 20, 2024, feeding big country raw fare game chicken, salmon, beef. They've been HOOKED from the start, going feral whenever I open the fridge. 

BCR recommend 4 oz raw a day split in two meals. After doing some research i will be switching to red dog blue cat as the ingredients are better and was recommended from the pet store. 

Last week I caught my boy eating out of the litter box, and then it clicked why it felt so clean all the time. He's been eating the poo. There was also a few times I found a small piece of poop on the coffee table, so I'm wondering from that. 

So I started doing up their food. For each meal they get 2 oz raw, half a sardine, a mussel (no shell), goats milk, tsp of pumpkin, sprinkle of nutritional yeast and freeze dried beef liver, every other day I add a quail egg. It's been about 2 days of this. 

Last night I checked the litter box and there was a nice sized poop, good colour, texture. Before they were small, shriveled, and a bit white. I went to clean the box this morning and it was all gone, so I'm thinking he ate it again. It also looks like someone threw up, but ate it. 

I'm at a loss and starting to get worried. He scarfs his food down SO fast I have to lock him up so he doesn't take from his sister, who takes her time. I gave them chicken necks yesterday, and he wouldn't stop growling at his sister, they both had their own and eventually just froze while he growled both holding it but not chewing, I separated them and they were fine. 


 They have a scheduled vet visit this Friday, just wanna see what I can do on my own first as I know it can be pricey. 

We do live in a small one bedroom apartment with huge windows. They have a water fountain they share, cat tree, two litter boxes, boat loads of toys, I keep recycled materials out for them to explore, I let them explore my patio supervised a few times a day. I work from home Tuesday, Thursday, but I am out all day M,W,F. I was seeing someone for 6 months who would come over twice a week, but that ended a week and a half ago. 

Nothing else has changed, no new stressors that I can think of. 

Any advice, insight, nutrition I'm missing would be GREATLY appreciated. 

Sincerely a worried cat mama ❤️

1hfsn9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1hfsn9l/advice_needed_on_toxic_family_dynamics_and/,Advice Needed on Toxic Family Dynamics and Setting Boundaries ,"Hey everyone, this is going to be a long post, so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read part of my story. Thank you in advance.

I’m in a very difficult situation with my family, particularly with my brother and his girlfriend, Anna. I feel trapped in a toxic dynamic where my needs are ignored, and my health is being disregarded. I’m looking for advice on how to handle it, especially with my dad.

Here’s some context:

I have type 1 diabetes, heart problems, and anemia. My dad, who has one of the best medical aids in South Africa, refuses to help me with my medical aid. I can pay him back, but the coverage I need is far beyond what I can afford on my own. He has never once asked about my health or how my diabetes is doing, even though I’ve had these conditions for years. He’s never supported me or my brother in anything we’ve done. He also believes that the more you gift him, the more love and support he’ll give you. There’s a lot more to say about my dad, but I’ll focus on what’s bothering me right now.

So, with my dad giving a lot of excuses for not adding me to his medical aid, he is, however, paying for my brother’s girlfriend (Anna)’s medical aid, especially now that they have a baby. I understand supporting a new family is important, but it feels incredibly unfair that my chronic health issues are overlooked.

My brother has been physically abusive in the past. On one occasion, when I yelled at him for yelling at my mom and breaking things, he picked me up by the throat. Another time, when he had my phone for hours, he got angry when I asked for it back and threw it on the floor.

I’ve tried to communicate with my brother, but he just dismisses my feelings. When I try to explain myself or set boundaries, he gets angry, and things escalate quickly.

The situation with Anna complicates things further. I’ve always tried to be kind and helpful to her. I’ve brought her coffee in bed, bought her snacks when I bought some for myself, and even let her sleep in my bed when she and my brother were fighting because I believed she needed space. I’ve always done my best to support her, but when my brother and I have an argument, Anna always inserts herself, even though it’s between me and my brother.

For example, Anna gave birth on November 3rd, and on November 5th, while I was washing dishes, I mentioned that I was tired. I had been awake for two days because they had recently moved in with us, and their puppy wasn’t used to sleeping with others, which kept me awake. Additionally, my brother kept calling me in the early hours of the morning to update me on things. So, I was exhausted. When I said I was tired, my brother immediately told me, “Don’t let Anna hear you.”

I didn’t understand why I couldn’t express being tired, so I asked him, “What makes Anna better than anyone else? Why can’t I say I’m tired in front of her?” We have a history where I’m not allowed to express certain things around Anna. For instance, one time I was hanging clothes, and my brother came to the back door, asking for me. When I told him to come over, he got upset and said, “I don’t want Anna to f*** know what I’m about to say,” and then hit the wall.

But anyway back to what happened on the 5th, Not knowing Anna was walking towards the kitchen from the hallway, I got frustrated and asked, “Why can’t I express certain things in front of her? What makes her better(not thinking she thinks she's better, but why does my brother think that way).” Anna overheard this while walking from the hallway to the kitchen, and she stormed over, kinda almost pushed me aside, and told me, “Go lay down. You’re tired,” in a babyish voice.

My brother then started calling me names, and I tried to explain myself, but Anna didn’t want to listen. My brother kept insulting me, and when I told him to stop, he wouldn’t. I got increasingly anxious and started raising my voice. That’s when Anna accused me of not caring about my nephew because I was loud. She even threatened me with the idea that I wouldn’t be allowed to be part of my nephew’s life anymore while my brother threatened me with my life. 

So, I snapped and said, “F*** you, too, Anna,"" and told her, that, If she wants to spite me with my nephew and she didn’t want me in his life, then I wouldn’t be, until he’s old enough to understand.

Then, my brother threw a lit cigarette in my face. And again, he said he would unalive me. At that point, I realized they weren’t going to listen to my side of things, and it wasn’t worth continuing the argument. They were set on their own version of events, and nothing I said was going to change that. I left to calm down and called my dad. He sided with my brother and said I was at fault.

Everything happened while I was on a phone call with my fiancée, who is currently in South Korea for work. He knows what happened, and I explained it to my mom. A few days later, when I asked my mom if my nephew was okay because he had been crying, Anna stormed out of the room, angry that I even asked.

My mom is on my side because she understands how my brother is, and she’s seen how Anna treats me. She’s tried everything to get him to change, but he refuses. She knows it’s not just me, and she understands how tired I am. She’s a nurse, so she understands what I’m going through. She even told my brother to move out in January. She’s giving him time to get a job. The other thing is, I arranged an interview for my brother, but Anna decided he shouldn’t go because she didn’t want to be alone with us, and she wanted him to help take care of my nephew while she’s on unpaid leave. She still doesn’t appreciate that my fiancée and mom have been paying for the roof over their heads for three months and for all their food and other necessities like shampoo. She won’t even say thank you to my mom. She says thank you to my brother but refuses to let him go for an interview in a country where people would kill for a job.

I know it may sound like I’m blaming others all the time, but I do recognize that I get overwhelmed sometimes. When you pour fire on fire, it just gets worse. Sometimes I can’t help it, and this has been happening for 17 years. It’s not that I’m calling names; I just try to explain myself or set boundaries, and then everything escalates. Whenever I ask my brother what I’ve done to deserve this, he can never answer. The only thing he says is that I “nag” a lot. But I don’t think it’s nagging when I ask for basic things like help. For example, when you make food, just close the bread to prevent it from getting hard or letting flies get on it, or put the cheese back in the bag instead of leaving it half-open in the fridge, making it hard. These are normal things I ask for because it costs a lot of money to keep replacing items like cheese because they weren’t stored properly. But he says I’m nagging and treating him like a child. I just feel that if he followed the simple things my mom taught him, no one would need to remind him. It’s just normal.

I really need advice on how to handle this situation and protect my mental and emotional health.",1,1734380895.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False
1hfsn1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1hfsn1n/hes_just_not_that_into_me/,He's just not that into me.,"A sobering realisation.

Had a traumatic breakup in December last year
Joined the app again in September.
Had a few dud dates and finally matched with someone I really vibed with.
He is really nice, kind, dynamic, has interesting hobbies and shared a similar sense of humour.
He had just got out of a 3 year relationship 3 months prior.
We had 4 dates. However something seems off and he wasn't good with making plans to meet but was always keen to text, send memes etc. 

I'm not much of a texter, I prefer hanging out in person. I will however text more regularly if my potential partner prefers it.

I vocalised that I would like if we could meet more consistently (once a week  unless otherwise occupied) and plan the meet up  a couple of days in advance (instead of 'playing it ear' the day of). I'm not particularly high maintenance when it comes to activities. I even enjoy walks in the park with an ice cream or coffee in hand.

He said he couldn't do that. Because he didn't have the mental capacity to do it .

He lives 2 miles from me, works remotely, for around 4-6 hours a day. No kids or personal commitments.

He just wasn't willing to make an effort.

I told him its best we part ways and wished him all the best. However he has been trying  to string me along by texting me every week/couple of weeks saying he doesn't ""understand what happened"" . And every time I explain I need consistency I get the same response as before. 

I think the term here  is breadcrumbing. He is hoping to keep me on the back burner until its convenient for him.

I'm not particularly interested in being a Whatsapp pen pal. I've decided to match his energy. I've communicated my needs clearly.  If he will not make an effort to see me, I will not make an effort to text him. This will probably result in this fizzling  out and dying.

Not really sure what the point of the post is.
Just a vent I suppose.

1hfsg5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDrewCareyShow/comments/1hfsg5z/series_restoration_season_7_complete/,Series Restoration: Season 7 complete,"As of this afternoon, all season 7 episodes have been completed and are available for download. (Request a link from me via chat, if you're interested.)

Season 7 is the first season to be shot in HD and released in a widescreen format. I'd love to offer a 1080p version, but I only have access to the 720p episodes from Plex (and RewTV). If anyone can help me obtain seasons 7-9 in 1080p, I would be very, very grateful. (There is a 1080p version on PlutoTV, including at least one episode that isn't on Plex, but I currently have no way of downloading those.) Please send me a message if you can help. I'll re-release season 7 in 1080p, if I can get those files.

**Some notes on season 7:**

1. Episodes 1-3 are not available on Plex, so I reconstructed them from other sources. I put a lot of effort into making them look as good as possible, but they are not quite as crisp as the rest of the season. (I included the full details on this in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDrewCareyShow/comments/1h87ae8/by_request_update_on_the_now_complete_s07/).)
2. In anticipation of obtaining the 1080p files from PlutoTV, I went ahead and upscaled S07E01-02 (""Drew Carey's Back-to-School Rock 'n' Roll Comedy Hour, Parts I-II"") to 1080p. This episode is not available on any streaming platform, so I assume this will be the only way to have a clean ""1080p"" version. I did not, however, do the same for S07E03 (""Drew Gets Out of the Nuthouse""), because PlutoTV has this episode in 1080p, and I would rather reconstruct the episode using that content than release a lower quality upscale.
3. As mentioned previously, if I observe an error on screen (e.g. crew member, camera equipment, etc.), I will make an attempt to correct the mistake. In my opinion, this is the closest way of replicating the original broadcast experience, seeing as most people were watching the episodes on a 4:3 television, where these mistakes would have been off screen, and thus not visible. However, it has been requested that I also make an uncorrected version available, so anyone who prefers those versions should look for the files with ""\[UNCORRECTED\]"" in the file name. As a quick comparison of an uncorrected/corrected shot, here are screenshots from S07E16 ""Pretty Baby"":

4. Just like in previous seasons, several episodes had content from the TBS airings that was not present in any other version I could find. I have learned very recently that this additional footage was actually *not* included in the original broadcasts on ABC, which means TBS was airing never-before-seen content. For this reason, I have adjusted the filenames and tags to indicate that the versions with added footage are ""extended"" versions. (I went into detail about how I included the TBS footage into these episodes in another recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDrewCareyShow/comments/1hafczk/series_restoration_mini_update_s07e06_busted/).)

Here are the episodes from season 7 that contain additional content:

* **S07E06 - ""Bus-ted""** (15 seconds added from TBS version) Added jokes - Video 6.5/10, Audio 6.5/10
* **S07E11 - ""Mr. Laffoon's Wild Ride""** (44 seconds added from TBS version) Added jokes - Video 6.5/10, Audio 4/10
* **S07E12 - ""Hotel Drew""** (48 seconds added from TBS version) - Added jokes - Video 7.5/10, Audio 8/10
* **S07E21 - ""Never Been to Spain""** (25 seconds added from TBS version) - Added jokes - Video 7.5/10, Audio 8/10
* **S07E24 - ""What Women Don't Want""** (6 seconds added) - Added joke - Video 7.5/10, Audio 8/10

**Looking ahead to season 8…**

I've watched through just the first episode of season 8, and it suffers from some very strange issues I have not encountered previously. In S08E01, several shots are zoomed/cropped, compared to the RewTV version and the original airings. What made it especially noticeable was the fact that the final frame of each zoomed/cropped shot was consistently *not* zoomed/cropped, creating a very odd playback experience… Correcting the numerous zoomed/cropped shots will take a decent amount of effort and time, so I'm hoping this will not be a continuing issue throughout the season, and that this is just a one-off. (Note: I hopped onto PlutoTV to stream the episode, and I confirmed that the same issue exists on the PlutoTV version as well. This means the work will need to be done regardless, but doing the work on a 1080p version would provide much better results. Again, any help with this is greatly appreciated.)

Anyway, I'll continue to keep you all updated as I continue the work.

Personal note: I've completed a third round of interviews for a job I'm hoping to land. If I'm hired, I'll likely start in February, so I'll be working as best I can to complete the series reconstruction before then. If I don't, I'll still continue to work through the episodes, but the releases will likely be noticeably slower.

If you'd like to buy me a coffee while I continue working through the series, please feel free: [https://ko-fi.com/djpitab](https://ko-fi.com/djpitab)

Quick update: There is a 1080p rip from PlutoTV available for season 1, which was shared with me. Since the Pilot is the only episode from season 1 that would benefit from an updated remaster, I obtained that episode and looked it over. Unfortunately, the version I got is 30fps… I'm not certain if all files obtained from PlutoTV will be like this, but that could put a huge damper on things, if so.",8,1734380359.0,TheDrewCareyShow,2,1.0,False

We had my bfs immediate family xmas yesterday.  I am 32, nonbinary, he is 33m. This is only our second Xmas together, and the first I've had with just his immediate family. All his extended family is on Xmas eve.

I didnt know or expect to get any gifts, so it was a pleasant surprise when I got handed 3. I received new glasses and bar tools. I don't drink, but bf told his mom I like to make mocktails and weird coffee drinks when she had asked what I wanted. Cool cool, all is fine. 

I opened the last gift, which was from my bfs grandma. A small and kinda heavy cylinder. I open to find it is a bottle of soap. Already a weird gift, right? Who gives body wash?

But its not body wash.

It was summer's eve.  

For those of you who don't know, summers eve is a 'ph balanced wash for intimate parts'. Their entire brand revolves around female intimate parts, and its only known for that one use.

I got gifted vagina soap. 

Not only was I gifted a coochie refreshment by my bfs grandma of all people, but I am nonbinary. If this *was* meant as an insult, it would be a two pronged attack of both calling me a slut and calling my gender worthless.

I opened this in the group while kids were going hay wire and wanting to move onto their next gifts, and I didnt wanna make a scene. I said thank you and showed to my bf quickly. He didn't clock it, as he was distracted and didn't read packaging. And I don't expect most cis dudes to register it on first glance. When we left and dropped bfs kids off at their moms, I told them (bfs ex and her bf)  what I got and she was shocked. Thats when I told my bf what it really was. He had no idea what summers eve was, and neither did the ex's bf.

Bf and I talked, and grandma has been getting weirder and weirder with her gifts to everyone over the years. Gave a great grandson a weird snowman figurine, weird dish towels to bf last year, etc.  Bf says she probably grabs things randomly from her apartment to gift to people, and is too prideful to ask for help to go out shopping (limited mobility). That, and she probably didn't know I was gonna be there till last minute and was scrambling for a gift. 

Soooooooo yeah, I got vagina soap for my presumed anatomy. Who knows, Maybe it was an insult. Maybe she thinks she knows what I'm packing anatomically cause i smell like a fisherman's dock down there and don't know it? I'm diagnosed autistic, so its possible it was an insult and just went over my head. 

And if it was an insult, its a pretty funny one honestly. Touche. ",2,1734380069.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I’m posting just so I can get this off my chest and not overthink it. I had a final interview for a job on Thursday and it went great! I loved the team and they (from what I can tell really liked me/my answers). This role would really allow me to grow and develop as well as re-vamp a large part of their organization. I ended my final interviews with a coffee chat with the manager I’d be re-vamping the organization with and asked him what’s the timeline for getting an offer/when would I start. He said I’d likely hear back within a week or two (which is odd since it’s the holiday season and I’m assuming companies want to secure roles for the new year) and he told me I’m the only candidate currently in the final round.
However, I haven’t heard anything since Thursday. I’ve had team members respond to my thank you emails but that’s it. In previous roles, I’ve heard back same day, if not by Friday. I’m starting to spiral a bit and think maybe they decided against me? Has anyone heard back days later from a job and gotten good news? Am I overthinking this? ",3,1734380041.0,interviews,1,1.0,False

TLDR: My male cat is eating his poop from the litter box, they eat raw and I've added more/new proteins, I feel I'm checking all the boxes and unsure what's missing.

Hey everyone! Looking for some guidance here. My babies are 5 months old (07/12/2024) my grey female Briar Rose and my black male Lucien. 

I started a raw diet Nov 20, 2024, feeding big country raw fare game chicken, salmon, beef. They've been HOOKED from the start, going feral whenever I open the fridge. 

BCR recommend 4 oz raw a day split in two meals. After doing some research i will be switching to red dog blue cat as the ingredients are better and was recommended from the pet store. 

Last week I caught my boy eating out of the litter box, and then it clicked why it felt so clean all the time. He's been eating the poo. There was also a few times I found a small piece of poop on the coffee table, so I'm wondering from that. 

So I started doing up their food. For each meal they get 2 oz raw, half a sardine, a mussel (no shell), goats milk, tsp of pumpkin, sprinkle of nutritional yeast and freeze dried beef liver, every other day I add a quail egg. It's been about 2 days of this. 

Last night I checked the litter box and there was a nice sized poop, good colour, texture. Before they were small, shriveled, and a bit white. I went to clean the box this morning and it was all gone, so I'm thinking he ate it again. It also looks like someone threw up, but ate it. 

I'm at a loss and starting to get worried. He scarfs his food down SO fast I have to lock him up so he doesn't take from his sister, who takes her time. I gave them chicken necks yesterday, and he wouldn't stop growling at his sister, they both had their own and eventually just froze while he growled both holding it but not chewing, I separated them and they were fine. 


 They have a scheduled vet visit this Friday, just wanna see what I can do on my own first as I know it can be pricey. 

We do live in a small one bedroom apartment with huge windows. They have a water fountain they share, cat tree, two litter boxes, boat loads of toys, I keep recycled materials out for them to explore, I let them explore my patio supervised a few times a day. I work from home Tuesday, Thursday, but I am out all day M,W,F. I was seeing someone for 6 months who would come over twice a week, but that ended a week and a half ago. 

Nothing else has changed, no new stressors that I can think of. 

Any advice, insight, nutrition I'm missing would be GREATLY appreciated. 

Sincerely a worried cat mama ❤️
