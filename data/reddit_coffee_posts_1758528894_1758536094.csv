I remember my very first business meeting in the Diplomatic Area. The room, encased in glass with panoramic views of Bahrain Financial Harbour, buzzed with energy‚Äîhalf the table was made up of women entrepreneurs, several wearing abayas beneath blazer jackets. Over Arabic coffee, a senior banker mentioned Bahrain Bay‚Äôs growing reputation as a launchpad for female-led startups. It wasn‚Äôt just words. Later that year, two of my closest business contacts‚Äîboth women‚Äîsecured grants through Tamkeen to scale their ventures.\
\
Alt text: A diverse group of business professionals in a modern meeting room, Bahrain company formation context. making up 30% of GDP‚Äîa figure steadily rising, due in no small part to active female participation. Reuters (May 2025) highlights that women now own or co-own over 41% of newly registered commercial entities in the Seef District, a figure far higher than in the UAE or Saudi Arabia.\
Importantly, Bahrain‚Äôs Economic Development Board (EDB) attributes this progress to targeted reforms, government funding, and a strong pipeline of new entrepreneurs‚Äîespecially among women. The country‚Äôs liberal regulatory environment, simplified company formation in Bahrain, and competitive costs make it ideal for anyone (especially those who demand equal footing).\
But‚Äîthere are nuances. I‚Äôve found that official figures only hint at what‚Äôs possible. The real drivers are the programs, incentives, and regulatory shortcuts specifically designed for women business owners.\
Government Support Programs for Women Entrepreneurs\
Tamkeen: Bahrain‚Äôs Entrepreneurial Powerhouse\
\
Alt text: Professional business support through consultation in Bahrain, Tamkeen support.\
- Subsidized office rentals (up to 50% for first 18 months)\
- Fast-track advisory pipeline: women-owned businesses can book priority consultation slots every Thursday at the Seef Mall Tamkeen Office (insider tip: book pre-Ramadan to avoid waiting lists)\
- Sector-specific training: FinTech, e-commerce, health, and education\
Pro tip: Tamkeen‚Äôs e-portal sometimes gets bogged down during the last week of the month. Submit your application documents in the first two weeks‚Äîresponse times are usually two business days, much faster than elsewhere in the GCC.\
Supreme Council for Women & Sijilat Registry Privileges\
The Supreme Council for Women coordinates with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) to issue ‚ÄúWomen-Owned‚Äù status on the Sijilat commercial registration portal. This marker isn‚Äôt cosmetic. It means:\
\
Priority during license review\
Expedited bank account opening (24‚Äì48 hours with active Sijilat tag, compared to 7-10 days otherwise)\
Access to special zones in Bahrain Bay and Manama Centre with flexible lease agreements, especially for micro-businesses\
Participation in government procurement opportunities reserved for majority-female-owned companies\
\
Surprisingly, this ‚Äústatus‚Äù means you‚Äôre often first in line during annual regulatory audits‚Äîprovided your paperwork is in order (more on that soon).\
Women-Friendly Business Structures and Ownership\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain, women and men negotiating company formation.: 100% ownership, with limited liability. Popular among solo entrepreneurs‚Äîespecially in service, e-commerce, or consulting. No need for a local sponsor or male partner.\
- With Limited Liability (WLL): Allows more flexibility for joint ventures. Women can hold 100% shares. For family businesses, this structure helps with legacy planning.\
- Foreign Ownership:** The 2023 liberalization (per the latest government guidelines) means women from any nationality can own up to 99‚Äì100% equity in most sectors. Compare this to the UAE or KSA, where local sponsorship is still required in several fields.\
And‚Äîunlike in the UAE, where the nominee system prevails, Bahrain offers direct access to business banking, government incentives, and property ownership without roundabout legal workarounds.\
Side note: If you‚Äôre starting a consultancy or tech startup, consider a presence in Bahrain‚Äôs Free Zones, where women founders enjoy reduced visa costs, rent discounts, and streamlined customs clearance.\
2025 Regulatory Changes: Faster Licenses, Lower Costs\
In February 2025, MOICT announced a new ‚ÄúExpress Sijilat‚Äù pathway. This means:\
\
Priority queuing for women-led businesses at government counters, especially in the Bahrain Bay and Sanabis service centers.\
Online application speeds: Sijilat Commercial Registration (CR) for women entrepreneurs now processed in as little as 36 hours (previously 7 days).\
Waived fees for the first year for the first 200 women-owned startups of 2025 (BHD 50‚Äì70 saving per application).\
\
I learned the value of this shortcut when I needed a license for a boutique concept in the Diplomatic Area. My advice: have your digital documents scanned and named (in English and Arabic) before you log onto Sijilat. Use PDF/A format‚Äîthey won‚Äôt reject your upload for formatting errors.\
For office registration: the Bahrain Financial Harbour branch of MOICT is open Saturdays, too (take advantage to avoid weekday queues).\
Step-by-Step: Bahrain Company Formation for Women (With Insider Tips)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, paperwork and workflow during company formation. to assess the right fit (SPC, WLL, branch office, etc).\
- For solo-owned businesses, SPC is the fastest route.\
- Family business? WLL is your best choice.\
Step 2: Name and Pre-Approval\
\
Choose an Arabic and English name. Business names referencing ‚ÄúBay,‚Äù ‚ÄúHarbour,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGulf‚Äù are in vogue, but check Sijilat for reserved terms.\
For women, the ‚ÄúExpress‚Äù queue gets picked up at Sijilat counters, especially in Seef District‚Äîshow your Women-Owned founder ID for priority.\
\
Step 3: Preparation of Documents\
\
National ID or passport copy (and Bahraini ID for locals)\
Proof of address (utility bill or lease)\
Memorandum & Articles of Association (template is available via Tamkeen‚Äôs support portal)\
Digital logo and letterhead (expedites branding approval)\
For non-Bahrainis, a foreign ownership activity guide is key\
\
My shortcut: prepare every file as both Word and PDF. Sometimes, MOICT officers request editable files for minor corrections‚Äîsaves hours compared to resubmitting new PDFs.\
Step 4: Submit to Sijilat & Tamkeen\
\
Register on Sijilat Portal\
Apply for Tamkeen support simultaneously to sync funding with license issuance\
Double-check sector licenses (food, healthcare, etc. need extra steps)\
\
Step 5: Open Bank Account and Final Licensing\
\
Banks in Bahrain Bay and Seef District are used to fast-tracking women-owned business accounts (especially when Sijilat status is flagged)\
Expect same-day IBAN if paperwork is complete\
\
Step 6: Post-Formation Support\
\
Sign up for Tamkeen mentorship (monthly slots via WhatsApp, the official business communication tool in Bahrain)\
Accounting and Bookkeeping Services are mandatory‚Äîoutsourcing this frees up time and helps avoid rookie mistakes\
\
Ramadan tip: Government offices adjust to shorter hours and sometimes serve coffee and dates‚Äîmaster the local etiquette, and always accept coffee when offered.\
What Does It Cost? Real Numbers for 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs of Bahrain company formation, calculator and business finance. remain among the lowest in the region. Major 2025 numbers:\
\
Commercial Registration (CR): BHD 50-75 (waived for the first 200 women-owned entities in 2025)\
Legal Fees and Document Prep: BHD 350‚Äì600\
Minimum Office Lease: BHD 150/month in Seef, Diplomatic Area, or Bahrain Bay (Tamkeen covers up to 50% for women)\
Government sector license (F&B, education, etc): BHD 150‚Äì350\
Annual Renewal: BHD 50‚Äì90\
\
Total startup budget: BHD 700‚Äì1,500 (including legal, lease, and renewals for first year)\
One common error: underestimating setup fees for sectoral licenses. Avoid this by referencing the relevant government fee tables or connecting with local consultants before your Sijilat submission.\
Compliance, Bookkeeping, and Avoiding Regulatory Pitfalls\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, Bahraini business woman reviewing documents. to stay compliant\
- Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) quotas: Women-led startups often qualify for reduced Bahrainization percentage, making it easier to hire staff quickly\
Small tangent here: I once forgot to align my fiscal year with the Islamic calendar‚Äîthis delayed my VAT refund by three months. My fix: always ask your accountant to double-check fiscal year alignment when registering with MOICT.\
And don‚Äôt neglect networking: Bahrain‚Äôs majlis-style business meetings, whether at Bahrain Financial Harbour or a traditional office in Adliya, are where deals happen. Bring business cards in both languages (Arabic on one side, English on the other).\
Beyond Formation: Long-Term Support and Growth Resources\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, consultation for women business founders in Bahrain.)\
- Transparent regulatory updates (new Express Sijilat system)\
- Faster licensing, lower costs, and nurturing business districts like Seef and Bahrain Bay\
The only real barrier? Not knowing these shortcuts exist.\
My Hardest Challenge‚Äîand How to Beat It\
During my second startup in Seef, the biggest headache was synchronizing Tamkeen grant approval with my Sijilat license. If your timing is off, you get stuck in an administrative loop. The solution: use Tamkeen‚Äôs WhatsApp hotline, and always submit grant applications immediately after you‚Äôve received your Sijilat pre-approval but before your final license is issued. This triggers cross-departmental alerts and, in my case, meant funding landed in my bank just two days after receiving my company registration.\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & Women Entrepreneur Support\
Q1: Can non-Bahraini women fully own a company in Bahrain?\
Absolutely. Thanks to the recent liberalization reforms, women of any nationality can own up to 100% of most business types, with no need for a male sponsor.\
Q2: How fast can a woman get a commercial registration (CR) in Bahrain?\
With the Express Sijilat system, most women-owned startups receive their CR within 36‚Äì72 hours‚Äîoften faster than neighboring Gulf countries.\
Q3: What specific funding is available for women entrepreneurs?\
Tamkeen offers grants (BHD 3,000‚Äì15,000), subsidized training, and access to special procurement programs for women. Early 2025 launches include a 50% office rent subsidy and mentorship programs via WhatsApp.\
Q4: Are there ongoing compliance requirements?\
Yes‚Äîmonthly VAT, annual audit (even for SPCs), labor quotas, and sector-specific paperwork. Outsourcing to specialist services is highly recommended for time and cost savings.\
Q5: What should I avoid when forming a company as a woman in Bahrain?\
Don‚Äôt underestimate sector-specific licenses or submit incomplete documentation. Prepare all files in English and Arabic, check your files for formatting, and always use official WhatsApp business channels for updates.\

Working Ones Do","Here‚Äôs the blunt truth: Dubai is not a place where you can coast on hype. This city is unforgiving with founders who only have polished screenshots but nothing solid behind them. Investors here won‚Äôt bankroll a mockup, and clients won‚Äôt tolerate excuses when payments fail or APIs crash.

AI builders are seductive. They give you something that looks like a product; screens, smooth flows, a clickable demo you can parade around at DIFC or in a caf√© at JLT. But when it‚Äôs stress-tested?

Workflows collapse.

Integrations stop talking.

Payments disappear into the ether.

Your ""app"" dissolves back into a deck of slides.


That‚Äôs the brutal difference between Silicon Valley daydreaming and the Dubai grind. This city rewards execution, not theater. The gap between being seen as a founder and actually being one is measured in whether your product survives the real market.

That last 20%; the plumbing, the backend wiring, the bug fixing, the grunt work nobody brags about is exactly where your credibility in Dubai is made or broken.

That‚Äôs where I come in. I‚Äôve been helping founders in this market take AI-driven or vibe-coded prototypes and turn them into apps that actually ship:

Backends that don‚Äôt crumble on day one

Payment systems that work in the UAE (and beyond)

Workflows that scale with real traction

Support that doesn‚Äôt vanish the second you hit launch


And here‚Äôs the thing: timelines here are short. Investors, clients, and partners don‚Äôt wait quarters. If you can‚Äôt deliver in days or weeks, someone else will.

So, ask yourself: do you want to keep impressing people with screenshots in coffee shops, or do you want to stand in front of investors and clients with a product that survives Dubai‚Äôs heat?

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I focused on always showing up for myself, even if I didn't want to. Tools were my best friend for this. I used a gym app to track my fitness goals, but what really helped was¬†[this](https://link.purposa.app/4)¬†app that made me the best version of myself yet.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

I have felt off since Friday evening. I thought I was getting sick, but I also upped my dosage for my anxiety meds so I thought maybe that was it. I woke up Sunday feeling kinda normal so I got up around 7 to go and get myself a drink from a coffee shop in the town over. 

About an early 2023, a house that sits across the street from my neighborhoods main road burned down. It was awful. Insurance paid basically nothing because of some bogus reason. The town and some churches helped put on a small fundraiser dinner for the homeowner and my husband and I went. It was in the Catholic Church in our town and it has some beautiful features I vividly remember and at the time took pictures off. She was very kind and I felt so bad. It was unusual for my husband and I to do this - and it was the first time we really got out in our small towns community. The house stands burnt. 

Or stood? Today, I was shocked to see the same shabby red house standing. The house was/is older, a little run down. It‚Äôs not like this is a new build and I missed it. This is THE SAME HOUSE. 

I turned around and went back home, I literally felt ill. I came in and told my husband it was standing and he looked at me like I‚Äôd lost my mind. He said we‚Äôve never done something like that, and there‚Äôs been no big house fire in town since he moved in with me here in 2020.

I was having a panic attack, and my husband definitely is thinking I‚Äôm insane.

1nni52d,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/1nni52d/21_yo_student/,21 yo student,"Hi all, 

Just looking for some general advice + whether to get a cheap car or not.

Currently: 

\- 7k in HISA, 1k in commsec (ASX200), 1k in Vanguard (VGS) , 5.1k in super (REST). No debt, just Hecs mounting up. I have no emergency funds account.

\- studying computer science/commerce (finance). Have a big-4 internship for the summer and will receive 5k from that. 

\- during semesters, I work casually, 15hours a week. Usually around 800-1k per fortnight (I do 50% savings, 20% investing, rest to get by with). 1.2k per fortnight during the break.

\- spending habits: biggest culprit is coffee, public transport fees, food, + other material things. I've improved and switched to buying things second-hand and selling off old things, and just having a more minimalist lifestyle. Living at home, paying $0.00 rent. 

,  
My main issue right now is whether to get a car. For uni I travel 1.5h each way, 2 days a week. I've done it for 2 years now, and I have one more year left to do. The only part that annoys me is that I live quite far from friends and since we only have one family car, I can't casually run errands/go gym, and my health is something that I want to prioritise. I'd def get a second-hand car EOY, which my parents would help me buy, but I'd cover ongoing insurance + rego which I'd rather save/invest.

Alternatively, my parents would be happy to give me the current family car in 1-2 years when they upgrade, but ofc I'd have to keep relying on public transport to get everywhere until then. 

I only have a year left, and then I'll most likely start work in the city, for which I would take the train, but I'll still be inconvenienced doing smaller trips or getting around in a years time.  

Questions: 

1. Should I wait for a few years until I get our family car, and then whatever money I save up can be used for better things (house deposit)? Then instead of getting a car, I would go on a smaller trip at the end of the year with friends.

2. Are there any good savings accounts that makes accessing ur money inconvenient? I have a big issues with just taking small amounts from my savings because both checking and savings is visible in commbank and when im 0 on checking, I'll take like 10-15...

I brushed my teeth, got dressed and then I left my house to grab myself some coffee from the convenience store.

I even saw some people's umbrellas turned inside out by the wind.

I also saw some people left their comment like that on the internet.

It has a fluffy lamb wool texture, paired with chestnut brown color blocking‚Äîfull of warmth and a high-end casual vibe.
This bag not only has a soft winter feel but also incorporates the classic silhouette of the Kelly bag. It exudes French elegance that girls of any age can‚Äôt resist.
Whether you match it with a simple sweater, a wool coat, or daily casual wear, it instantly makes you look younger while keeping a fashionable style.
As a limited-edition item in boutiques, it‚Äôs extremely hard to get (you need to spend a lot to qualify for purchasing it) and requires a long wait. But its rarity and classic design make it well worth buying.

2. Canvas Kelly 28

Just like the woven check blazer that almost everyone has, this Kelly bag cleverly combines woven canvas with warm brown cowhide‚Äîit‚Äôs low-key, elegant, and full of retro charm.
The canvas material is light and durable, and when paired with smooth Swift leather, the overall design is classic yet fresh. It‚Äôs a standout piece for autumn and winter outfits.
Whether you pair it with a wool coat, a leather jacket, or a casual sweater, this bag handles it all easily, showing the balanced beauty of French elegance and urban style.

3. Kelly Lakis 35

As a hot item in the secondary market, Lakis is a custom-designed bag named after a Greek wealthy businessman.
He found that the lock was opened and closed frequently, making it inconvenient to store small travel items like passports. So he suggested adding a small zipper pocket on the outside of the Kelly bag.
The first version used canvas with leather accents, while the reissued version is made of full leather. The elephant gray Swift leather one in the picture is elegant and low-key.
With a short shoulder strap design, it‚Äôs more flexible and comfortable for outings. It looks grand while staying casual and relaxed‚Äîan excellent choice to boost your taste and functionality for autumn & winter 2024.

4. Birkin 35 Alligator (Caiman)

Just like a cup of rich, deep Italian espresso, this Marron d'Inde (deep coffee brown) Birkin 35 skillfully blends classic style with luxury.
The elegant brown tone is like the warm autumn sun, and the matching caiman leather has an extraordinary texture‚Äîevery grain tells a story of time.
Pair it with neutral-toned coats, wide-leg pants, or elegant dresses, and it easily transitions between business and casual occasions, showing the owner‚Äôs French nobility and modern style.
This isn‚Äôt just a bag‚Äîit‚Äôs a work of art worth collecting.

5. Birkin 35 Canvas with Saddle Leather

A limited-edition item from the 2008 India collection, it‚Äôs made of lightweight canvas and durable Barenia saddle leather.
The combination of Faubourg-colored saddle leather and beige canvas is warm, soft, and full of layers. The stripe details on the bag are full of exotic charm while keeping a modern touch.
Its light material and roomy interior make it an ideal choice for a one-night, two-day short trip.
Pair it with a classic trench coat or casual jeans, and it easily fits a unisex fashion style.",6,1758533781.0,RepHermes,4,1.0,False

Welcome to the [UPG of the Week](https://imgur.com/a/NFgZO57) post! This week we are praying for the **Arabs in Portugal**.

# An Aside:

This week we are looking at the Arabs of Portugal. Lately I have seen some vile/racist comments all over reddit about Muslim peoples in Europe, including this vile comment:

>They aren‚Äôt even hiding their intentions. Muslims plan to conquer Europe by demographic replacement. Will Europe wake up in time? ([source](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1962229450374041909))

For those that don't know why this is vile, this is the Great Replacement conspiracy. The ‚Äúgreat replacement‚Äù conspiracy, in simple terms, states that welcoming immigration policies ‚Äî particularly those impacting nonwhite immigrants ‚Äî are part of a plot designed to undermine or ‚Äúreplace‚Äù the political power and culture of white people living in Western countries. Multiple iterations of the ‚Äúgreat replacement‚Äù theory have been and continue to be used by anti-immigrant groups, white supremacists, and others.

George Bush pushed back on this in the 2000's:

>Our identity as a nation, unlike other nations, is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood. ... This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.

With that said, we ought to be praying for Muslim peoples there, not just for their salvation, but against the racism they are experiencing existing in places like France.

>*It has been noted to me by* u/JCmathetes *that I should explain this ranking. Low numbers are more urgent, both physically and spiritually together, while high numbers are less urgent. The scale is 1-177, with one number assigned to each country. So basically on a scale from Afghanistan (1) to Finland (177), how urgent are the peoples physical and spiritual needs.*

**Climate:**¬†Portugal is mainly characterized by a Mediterranean climate, temperate maritime climate in the mainland north-western highlands and mountains, and in high altitude zones of the Azorean islands; a semi-arid climate in parts of the Beja District far south and in Porto Santo Island, a warm desert climate in the Selvagens Islands and a humid subtropical climate in the western Azores, according to the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification. It is one of the warmest countries in Europe: the average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from 10‚Äì12¬†¬∞C (50.0‚Äì53.6¬†¬∞F) in the mountainous interior north to 16‚Äì18¬†¬∞C (60.8‚Äì64.4¬†¬∞F) in the south and on the Guadiana river basin.

**Terrain:**¬†Continental Portugal is split by its main river, the Tagus, that flows from Spain and disgorges in the Tagus Estuary at Lisbon, before escaping into the Atlantic. The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the south, including the Algarve and the Alentejo regions, is characterized by rolling plains. Portugal's highest peak is Mount Pico on Pico Island in the Azores. The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean. Despite these definitions, the Portugal-Spain border remains an unresolved territorial dispute between the two countries. The Portuguese coast is extensive; in addition to approximately 943 kilometres (586¬†mi) along the coast of continental Portugal, the archipelagos of the Azores (667¬†km) and Madeira (250¬†km) are primarily surrounded by rough cliff coastlines. Most of these landscapes alternate between rough cliffs and fine sand beaches; the region of the Algarve is recognized for its sandy beaches popular with tourists, while at the same time its coastline around Cape St. Vincent is well known for steep and forbidding cliffs.

**Wildlife of Portugal:**¬†The fauna of Portugal is a mixture of European and North African types. As in Spain, the wild goat, wild pig, Eurasian Otter, the genet, badger, mongoose, and deer can be found in the countryside. The wolf survives in the remote parts of the far north and northeast, and the lynx inhabits the Malcata Mountains. The fox, rabbit, hedgehog, and Iberian hare are ubiquitous. The Portugese Man'O'War is also native to the coasts of Portugal.

Thankfully, there are no wild monkeys in Portugal. However, there are wild monkeys in Gibraltar, which is super close.

**Environmental Issues**: Portugal is vulnerable to the climate change impacts from extreme events associated to lack (droughts) or excess (floods) of rainfall and heat waves. Sea level rise also is a threat to Portugal's coastline where significant amount of its population lives.

**Languages:**¬†Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. Mirandese is also recognized as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern Portugal. It is part of the Astur-Leonese group of languages. The Arabs speak Arabic.

**Government Type:**¬†Unitary semi-presidential constitutional republic

# People: Lebanese Arabs in Portugal

[Lebanese Arab woman](https://preview.redd.it/wbjwom2froqf1.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5321b1375df554a71a86a2694035e1a4425aa15)

**Population**: 20,000

**Estimated** **Foreign** **Workers Needed:** 2+

**Beliefs:**¬†The Lebanese Arabs in Portugal are roughly 0.5% Evangelical, which may be what's got them still unreached on Joshua Project, as those who are believers outside this number are not actively sharing the Gospel or building up the church.

That means out of their population of 20,000, there are roughly only 2,000 Evangelical believers. Thats roughly 1 believer for every 200 unbelievers.

Most Lebanese Arabs are Muslim.

[Mosque in Lisbon](https://preview.redd.it/to315k6jqoqf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d74c99f3daa39e469ff6735c7daea3588f55fdb6)

**History:** The Lebanese diaspora has always been a target to the Lebanese state to create institutional connection. In 1960, the World Lebanese Cultural Union was established under the authority of the President Fouad Chehab.

France¬†has always been an important destination for the Lebanese diaspora, because Lebanon used to be administrated by the French after WWI and because the¬†French¬†language is¬†massively spoken¬†in Lebanon.

The Lebanese diaspora, while historically trade-related, has more recently been linked to the¬†Lebanese Civil War, with many Lebanese emigrating to¬†Western countries. Because of the economic opportunities, many Lebanese have also worked in the¬†Arab World, most notably¬†Arab states of the Persian Gulf¬†such as¬†Saudi Arabia¬†and¬†Kuwait.

**Culture:**¬†*Typical qualification that all people groups can't be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization.*

This is a write up specifically for Lebanese Arabs in Lebanon so its not entirely accurate.

>The Levant Arabs typically live in villages located near fertile regions; but they can also be found near mountain foothills in less arid regions. Although they have settled in towns or villages, they have held on to their tribal affiliations.

The various tribes are ruled by sheiks (Arab chiefs that are considered to be experts in Islam and in relating to the outside world). Their fortress-like villages can be easily defended. Each house has windows on all sides and is built facing the outside of the village. All goods and persons passing through town are strictly controlled.

Social life is extremely important to Arabs. They like to share a daily coffee time by sitting on the floor and drinking coffee from cups without handles. Their diet basically consists of wheat bread and porridge made with boiled meat or chicken.

Despite Islamic teachings, the reality of different classes of Arabs still persists. The type of clothing worn has become one of the determining factors. Levant tribesmen dress differently than other villagers and can be easily recognized. The women wear veils both in town and at home. Boys show that they are becoming men by changing their headgear and wearing daggers.

**Cuisine**: Portuguese cuisine is rooted in an Atlantic diet, with a lot of fresh seafood and cured meats, particularly pork.¬†Key ingredients include olive oil, garlic, and regional spices. Some of the main dishes are¬†bacalhau¬†(salt cod) and grilled sardines, soups like¬†caldo verde, and pastries such as¬†pastel de nata.¬†The cuisine is also known for its dynamic blend of Mediterranean foundations with spices and influences from its former colonial territories.¬†¬†

[Pastel de Nata](https://preview.redd.it/klub0t36roqf1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=80dc0c4e3d0100689aaa4982ad57f4b381170dd6)

Prayer Request:

* Ask the Lord to burden the hearts of Portugese Christians for the Arabs who live among them.
* Ask the Lord to save key leaders among the Arabs who will boldly declare the gospel.
* Pray that signs and wonders will follow the Arab believers as they share Christ with their families and friends.
* Ask God to raise up prayer teams who will begin breaking up the soil through worship and intercession.
* Pray that in this time of chaos and panic in the US that the needs of the unreached are not forgotten by the church. Pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the Good News
* Pray for our nation (the United States), that we Christians can learn to come alongside our hurting brothers and sisters and learn to carry one another's burdens in a more Christlike manner than we have done historically
* Pray for our leaders, that though insane and chaotic decisions are being made, to the detriment of Americans, that God would call them to know Him and help them lead better.
* Pray against Putin, his allies, and his insane little war.

*Brothers, my heart‚Äôs desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. (Romans 10:1)*

Hey everyone! So, can we just take a moment to appreciate the mind-blowing speed at which AI is transforming everything around us? üöÄ It‚Äôs like watching a sci-fi movie come to life! But here‚Äôs the catch: if we don‚Äôt *upskill right now*, we might just find ourselves staring at the credits while the rest of the world moves on to the next big adventure.

**Ever feel like you‚Äôre in a race?** ü§î Imagine you‚Äôre on a treadmill, and the speed is cranking up. You‚Äôve got two choices: hop off, or learn to run faster. The AI gold rush is very much that treadmill‚Äîit‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs furious, and if you aren‚Äôt keeping up, you might end up watching from the sidelines.

Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs absolutely crucial to invest in yourself and pick up these skills:

- **AI Is Here to Stay**: It‚Äôs not a passing trend; it‚Äôs becoming an essential tool in practically every field. Think about it‚Äîmarketing, education, healthcare, finance...you name it, AI is stepping in and shaking things up!

- **Job Opportunities are Evolving**: According to my sources (aka, the internet), industries are on the hunt for folks who know their way around AI tools. This isn't just for techies! If you can leverage these skills, you‚Äôll stand out like a diamond in a sea of rhinestones. üíé

- **Work Smarter, Not Harder**: Seriously, who wants to grind away at tedious tasks when AI can handle that? Learn to harness AI tools to automate, analyze, and enhance your workflow. Get ready to do more in less time‚Äîand spend that newfound time chilling out, being creative, or, like, binging your favorite shows guilt-free!

Here are some easy ways to dive into learning:

1. **Online Courses**: Platforms like Coursera or even the **Imagine AI Educational Program** (check it out [here](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals)) offer a range of options to help you get started, no matter your starting point. 

2. **Join a Community**: Like ours, for instance! You can exchange knowledge, ask questions, and share resources with people who are just as passionate about AI as you are.

3. **Hands-On Practice**: Got some free time? Why not experiment with AI tools? Play around with things like ChatGPT or Canva Magic to get a feel for how you could use these tools in your daily life.

4. **Stay Curious**: Read about new AI developments, trends, and tools. Seriously, just scrolling through your feed during a coffee break can introduce you to some jaw-dropping innovations.

And hey, if you‚Äôre worried about not knowing enough or feeling overwhelmed, just remember: **everyone starts somewhere**. Even the experts were once beginners!

So, let‚Äôs keep this convo going! What skills are you eager to pick up to stay in the race, or what fears do you have about the AI takeover? ü§ñüí¨",1,1758533671.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Sure, free‚Äîif you ignore the 60-second ads you can‚Äôt skip and the watermark so big it basically *is* the bikini. By the time I exported the clip, I couldn‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôd made a video or just given the app free publicity.

I also tested out a couple of mid-tier tools people kept mentioning. **Picwand**, for example, actually surprised me a bit‚Äîthe bikini generation effect wasn‚Äôt perfect, but at least it didn‚Äôt turn into complete nightmare fuel. Think ‚Äúokay for a demo reel,‚Äù not ‚Äúready for the big screen.‚Äù Still, compared to some of the horror-show outputs I got elsewhere, I‚Äôll give it credit.

Next stop: the heavy hitters like **Runway** and **Pika**. Credit where it‚Äôs due, the quality jumped way up. The clips actually looked decent‚Äîsmooth motions, no cursed lighting. But unless you‚Äôve got a monster PC and a subscription that costs more than a real swimsuit, good luck. My poor laptop fan was screaming louder than cicadas in July.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on the ‚Äúinstant bikini AI‚Äù tools that promise miracles. One clip had the bikini dissolving into the background like it was allergic to fabric. Another gave me a character whose eyes moved independently of her face. At one point I swear I‚Äôd accidentally directed a low-budget horror trailer.

So yeah. Now I‚Äôve got a folder full of AI Bikini clips ranging from ‚Äúkind of passable‚Äù to ‚Äúnightmare fuel.‚Äù Either I live with these cursed exports, or I study VFX until my hair turns grey. Apparently there‚Äôs no middle ground.

If anyone here has cracked the code and found a tool that doesn‚Äôt feel like spinning a roulette wheel, please drop a recommendation. Because my best export so far is literally named ‚Äúfinal\_final\_THIS\_TIME\_FOR\_REAL\_ai\_bikini.mp4‚Äù‚Ä¶ and it still looks like I rendered it on a toaster.

1nnhrxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anti_Opus_Dei/comments/1nnhrxc/opus_dei_is_run_by_people_who_joined_for_life/,"Opus Dei is run by people who ""joined"" for life aged 14.5 to 16","Before I launch in, a quick parenthesis on what ""join Opus Dei"" means or doesn't mean, a) in canon law, b) in the statutes of Opus Dei and c) in real life in Opus Dei.

**""Joining Opus Dei""**

a) Canon law

The prelature of Opus Dei consists of clergy only, not lay people (canon 294). The prelature could, with the pope's approval, set up a association of lay ""cooperators"" under canon 296 but it has never done so in the 40 odd years since it has been able to. Opus Dei is currently locked in combat with the Vatican, which keeps asking Opus Dei to update its statutes to be in line with canon law and papal decrees. 

b) Statutes of Opus Dei

Lay people can ask for ""admission"" to Opus Dei from the age of 16. I don't know when the rule changed (after 2004 when I left) but the minimum age used to be 14.5. In the first 6 months, they can leave at any time and cannot commit to celibacy. Then after 6 months the candidate makes a commitment for one year and renews this every year for 5 years when they make the ""fidelity"" - a commitment for life. The candidate can decide not to renew or make the fidelity and leave Opus Dei without prejudice to their rights as Catholics. 

Admission to Opus Dei means that celibate members are ""fully available"" to the prelature. This situation is highly anomalous in canon law and pastoral practice and leaves lay people open to exploitation, especially young ones, but the church has always refused to discipline Opus Dei, unlike other groups in the church.

c) In real life in Opus Dei

Lay people can ask for admission to Opus Dei - ""whistling"". Once accepted, they are treated from then on as full members for life, no matter their age. (There is no further discernment unless perhaps highly concerned relatives or priests get involved.) This is because Opus Dei equates membership with responding to a ""vocation to Opus Dei from all eternity"". This is a constant theme in internal documents, teaching and texts. 

In my case, it was not mentioned to me when I whistled as a celibate numerary that I could leave at any time in the first 6 months, nor that in the Statutes, I could not make a commitment to celibacy in that time. In fact, I never once saw the statutes of Opus Dei in my time in Opus Dei or had any talks on it.

So leaving Opus Dei - even a few weeks after ""joining"" as a teenager - is akin to a priest leaving his vocation. This is hard to believe for outsiders but every ex-member will tell you the same - it is our universal experience. This mentality is hardwired into the organisation but is not revealed publicly as it sounds so barmy, which it is. In fact, it is highly abusive, especially in the case of minors or vulnerable adults.  

**Opus Dei press officers**

Opus Dei press officers are among the lowest life forms on this planet. They lie through their teeth regularly on these topics to the church and in the media. They even fake indignation when called out on their lies, demanding a ""respect for individuals and their choices"" that they never show anyone else if they can help it. 

If you ask them about the claim that the statutes of Opus Dei are not shared within Opus Dei, they will probably say that they are. In fact, I remember a coffee table book displayed in a lounge in each residence about the ""Juridical Path of Opus Dei"" by Fuenmayor, which I never paid attention to. It has the statutes in their original, dense Latin. However, looking back, I can see that this sneaky tactic gives Opus Dei press officers some cover if pressed.

**Most of the leadership joined aged 14.5 to 16**

When I was in Opus Dei 20 years ago, the majority of male directors (all numeraries) and numerary priests in Great Britain had whistled between 14.5 and 16 in the 1970s or 80s ""Kelston"" boys club in south London. This includes Fr Nicholas Morrish, former Regional Vicar for GB, the most senior position in GB and now parish priest at St Thomas More in Westminster diocese. You can see my separate post about Quentin Chases, former director of Kelston, who was responsible for most of these ""vocations"". Most of the remainder whistled as undergraduate students by the age of 21 - in London, Manchester and Oxford, where Opus Dei has residences.  

These leaders are now in their 60s and 70s and they still form the bedrock of the leadership of Opus Dei in the UK - along with a number of Catalans/Spaniards drafted in in the 80s. As far as I can see, the situation is similar across the world. 

It is highly likely that the current and previous heads of Opus Dei, Don Fernando Ocariz and Don Javier Echevarria, whistled between 14.5 and 16 though I am sure the former won't be public about this if possible, as even he knows it looks bad. 

What this means for the governance of Opus Dei is that it is extremely hard for it to accept change. Remember, these guys who whistled 14.5+ often came from Opus Dei families and had been in Opus Dei clubs for several years before joining. All they know is Opus Dei. And even if their families were not Opus Dei, they had very little life and church experience before they were coerced into ""joining"" Opus Dei. 

For decades, these guys have laboured for Opus Dei. They have been immersed in Opus Dei's manipulative and emotionally abusive practices, which they believe are the will of God. Many of them have manipulated others, including minors, into Opus Dei, which they do not accept as evil. They have formed a collective mentality separate from the rest of the church and the world. They exist to protect the institution of Opus Dei. 

Some eventually fight their way out and rebuild their lives outside Opus Dei. Others may find a niche where they are safe from the worst excesses of Opus Dei, like being a priest in one of the parishes that Catholic bishops have entrusted to Opus Dei. Some keep up external jobs or somehow get enough life experience to see through the lies and deception. Some have relatives who go the extra mile to rescue them. But many others are lost in the system and go on to hurt many people and eventually experience major psychological problems. Some may realise late in life they were duped but feel it's too late to start again.

What doesn't generally happen is that the Catholic bishops try to rescue them. They have been too compromised for too long and are busy with other things, true to their nature as administrators rather than pastors. The worst offenders inside Opus Dei are often also the worst victims and Opus Dei leaders are good at keeping them out of bishops' sight. Opus Dei is also expert at offering priestly help to dioceses on their terms, like holiday cover for masses, and confessions in cathedrals, where Opus Dei priests hand out prayercards to try to recruit. With such a shortage of priests and from genuine gratitude, diocesan priests may be inclined to believe the lies and spin of Opus Dei press officers and their stooges in the Catholic media.  

This takes us back to the stubborn refusal of senior Opus Dei leaders in Rome to provide the Vatican with an acceptable revision to the Statutes.  To do so would go against every fibre of their beings. A canonically regular Opus Dei would spell the end of Opus Dei as it is now. Only the few in Opus Dei who are genuinely free could be comfortable with it. The coerced hardliners would not know what to do. Their world will be turned upside down. However, it might be this humiliation that makes a chink in their armour that might allow them to be rescued. ",1,1758533100.0,Anti_Opus_Dei,0,1.0,False

Former barista here. This is a very ‚Äútouchy‚Äù incident. Meaning while you‚Äôre reading this, I ask that you‚Äôre kind when responding. This is also a lengthy post, but it is worth the read. I ask that you read it entirely and carefully, and if you feel the need to comment, please do so. Keep it kind as I am still recovering from surgery and balancing a full schedule. I did what I feel was best.
~~~

I lost the apartment I was renting in December of last year, so I quit the job I was working at beforehand. I went on an excruciating and long journey to find a job that paid close to the amount I was making, but I wasn‚Äôt finding any luck. I told myself if I could make the hours work, I could settle for at least $10/hr, because I only pay car insurance and subscriptions like Spotify and Amazon. 

I stumbled across Scooters, and I have had multiple years of barista experience from other shops. I consider myself a coffee connoisseur/snob. I applied, got an interview, and started within the week. Perfect interview process! The manager seemed nice, the baristas on shift seemed nice, everything seemed relatively easy (I prefer regular ol portafilter and coffee grounds). 

I ended my training period end of January, and immediately started working 24-29 hours a week. That bumped me from $10.00 to $10.50. Great! I was promised in the interview that when my training period was over, I‚Äôd make $11.00 because of my previous experience. (Five years of barista experience and I only have a dollar raise? Slightly concerning.) 

Well, nonetheless, the menu is outrageous. Essentially a ‚Äúask for anything and we will figure it out‚Äù kind of menu. I come from smaller shops with a basic to slightly extended menu, but some options are not available as it hurts our business. I realize that Scooters is a chain. In fact I was slightly disappointed to hear that, because I have only worked at local and small shops. 

My last day of training was on the WORST station, blenders. I was let loose after that day, having absolutely zero understanding of the station. I continued to use the job aids, stand and stare before I‚Äôd make the drink, ask from across the store how to make the drink, my times were slow.

Fast forward to recently. It is now September, and as of last month and this month, I have had enough of this place. I do not perform well under pressure. And pressure is exactly what my now ex manager was all about. They stood over me in peak times with arms crossed waiting for a mistake, and under intense pressure, I am going to make a mistake. They then proceed to correct my action, and then I‚Äôm nervous to do anything else other than focus on that one drink, which makes my time slower. 

Mid rush, when everyone is in full speed, we are wrapped around the building, everyone‚Äôs ordering a drink and multiple types of food, everyone these days wants a blended drink. Blended this, blended that. And then out of the blue, the manager is screaming at the team, window open, mid rush, because we are ‚Äútoo slow‚Äù and have a 5:00 minute ticket because the car ordered a burrito, a cinnamon roll, a ciabatta, and three blenders. And the cars in front of them didn‚Äôt want to diet this morning either. ‚ÄúWe need to have a sense of urgency. There is no reason for a 5:00 minute ticket. This is ridiculous.‚Äù And continues to throw a tantrum. 

Now to last week. I have had gallbladder issues for the last four years. Unable to get surgery until now. I finally scheduled my pre-op for Monday the 15th. I had assumed my surgery would be the next day since I was going to an outpatient surgery hospital, (I was corrected by a family member that it would be scheduled based on the surgeon) LUCKILY, they had an opening on Wednesday, the 17th. I had requested MONDAY AND TUESDAY off originally for this surgery. (Mind you, I am also a full time college student, loading 13 credit hours this semester, while also taking another 9 credit hour class at a local EMS station for my EMT cert.) The schedule comes out on a weekly basis. The Saturday prior to pre-op and surgery rolls around, and the schedule is published. I open it, and I am PISSED. 

Not only did my manager schedule me for the DAY after surgery, but Friday, and the week after that. I have had absolutely enough. I did not bother asking them to change the schedule. I immediately threw my shift up for grabs (which nobody wanted to cover because it is a morning shift and they are all high schoolers.) In the notes I wrote: ‚ÄúSurgery for gallbladder removal‚Äù and that was the end of my worries. 

Surgery day rolls around, and nobody has picked up my shift. I don‚Äôt care anymore. I have so much stress on my plate. I throw my Friday shift up for grabs (same ordeal, in the notes I wrote: ‚ÄúRecovering from gallbladder surgery‚Äù) and same result, nobody takes the shift. Finally Friday rolls around, and I am completely out of patience. I was scheduled for a full weekend, after my surgery. I had plenty of conversations with my manager about the surgery, about my nervousness, about the stress. I cut my hours and availability in half because of classes, and yet I am still given an impossible schedule. 

I sent in an immediate resignation on Friday. It is now Monday with absolutely no response other than I am not on the schedule. 

How absolutely unprofessional and disgusting to have to feel as if I need to quit to heal from surgery because my barista job cannot function without me. We are by no means understaffed. My shift could have been covered. It is a lack of young staff wanting to fill the hours. 

I should not have to feel as if I need to quit my job because I am having a surgery that will put me out for roughly two weeks. I am five days post-op and still struggling to bend down, walk, and reach. I can‚Äôt lift over 10lbs, and standing for long periods of time is painful. 

I was practically forced to resign.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you reading this. I am just looking for some consolation from fellow baristas that have had similar experiences with foul management, and advice on anything I can do about it. (HR, etc.) My former manager does not need to be in a management position, but that is a different post for a different day. 

I am not looking for hate, I will scroll right past your thread. Please be kind, I am going through a lot of stress and emotions. ",1,1758533043.0,ScootersCoffee,0,1.0,False

The man in this short film, an elderly man named Oliver is at a caf√© where he is greeted by a waitress named Wendy, who was told to greet the man by her boss (who went through with the Rebirth program). He asks for an Americano with olive oil, to which he says to Wendy that his wife told that he should try it, going to that same cafe for decades.

 He talked about his wife and how she was beautiful. 

But it is shown that his wife went through with the Rebirth program after collapsing at the cafe and on life support. His wife **is** Wendy.

Why am I talking about an obscure short film to which I‚Äôve never heard of and is talking about?

When I watched the film, I felt my heart pounding and I felt so intensely interested, and overwhelmed. 

The idea of.. being reborn after living out your life, having a new life to the age you want, it‚Äôs just so overwhelmingly interesting!

I‚Äôve been in the same book club of 8 women since 2019. We normally rotate hosting at our homes, nothing fancy, just wine, snacks, discussion and a lot of laughing. One member, K (34F), has a nice patio and used to host most often, and everyone‚Äôs always liked going to hers.

The problem: K‚Äôs place is up a flight of 14 narrow stairs with no railing on one side. There‚Äôs no side entrance, no portable ramp that would work safely, and she can‚Äôt put in anything permanent since she rents. Since my accident, we‚Äôve covered her months by meeting in a coffee shop or library room nearby and it‚Äôs been fine. This month, K said she ‚Äúmisses hosting at home‚Äù and dropped her address in the group chat with, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make a Zoom link for OP.‚Äù

I replied straight away: I‚Äôm happy to meet, but I‚Äôd rather we choose a space I can actually get into. I offered to host, or book a free community room down the street (I even checked times), or chip in for a cafe table booking. K said she‚Äôs tired of making exceptions and that it‚Äôs her turn, her house. She suggested someone could ‚Äúcarry me up‚Äù which, apart from being unsafe, is insulting and not something I‚Äôll do.

Two people backed me straight away. Two said nothing. One person said I‚Äôm ‚Äúdictating the group‚Äù and that Zoom is good enough. K then said I can join online or skip, but she still expects the usual $15 contribution for wine and snacks since that‚Äôs what we always do.

I said I‚Äôm not paying for a meeting I physically can‚Äôt attend, and I‚Äôm not Zooming into something that‚Äôs meant to be social when there‚Äôs an easy alternative. I also said I‚Äôll happily host next month to keep the rotation fair. Now I‚Äôm getting side messages saying I‚Äôm being dramatic and that we‚Äôve always gone to K‚Äôs.

1nnhkx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nnhkx4/does_waterdrop_wdd6rf_replacement_water_filter/,Does Waterdrop WD-D6RF Replacement Water Filter Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review Inside!,"The **Waterdrop WD-D6RF Filter**, designed as a replacement for the WD-D6-B Tankless Reverse Osmosis System, claims to offer a host of benefits, including reducing PFAS, improving water taste, and simplifying maintenance. Having tested it personally in my home, I found plenty of strong features‚Äîand a few areas where it could be better. Here‚Äôs how it performed during everyday use.

**Ease of Installation and Compatibility**  
I was a bit skeptical at first‚Äîinstalling water filters can often turn into a headache. However, this sleek replacement filter surprised me by being incredibly easy to set up. With its twist-and-lock system, swapping out the old filter took me less than two minutes, and no tools were required. The intuitive design works seamlessly with the WD-D6-B system, but keep in mind that it‚Äôs incompatible with other models, which limits its versatility.  

I‚Äôd definitely recommend double-checking your system model before committing to this filter if you want to avoid compatibility issues. The compact, under-sink design saves plenty of space, making it great for smaller kitchens or apartments like mine.  

[Grab Waterdrop WD-D6RF at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0d2vzj4qn/)

**High-Quality Filtration**  
Filtration efficiency is where this product really shines. Boasting a six-stage filtration system, the filter eliminates contaminants like lead, chlorine, nitrates, sodium, PFAS, and more with an impressive accuracy level of 0.0001 microns. I tested the filtered water using a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter. The results consistently showed low TDS readings, indicating the filter effectively removed impurities.  

The additional use of Sri Lankan coconut shell carbon for the activated carbon block was a surprisingly unique feature. Judging by the refreshed water taste, it seems to live up to the promise of improving flavor by reducing chlorine, odors, and mineral aftertaste. That said, anyone with coconut allergies may need to steer clear of this product, as it might pose risks.  

**Longevity and Maintenance**  
According to the specs, this replacement filter offers a lifespan of up to 1 year or 1,000 gallons of water filtered‚Äîwhichever comes first. Owning the WD-D6RF has shown me that its lifespan may occasionally vary depending on your water usage and quality. In our household of four, where water for cooking, drinking, and making coffee flows through this filter daily, it comfortably lasted about 11 months before losing noticeable efficiency.  

I liked that maintenance requirements were minimal. A simple light indicator on the system lets you know when it‚Äôs time for a replacement, so there‚Äôs no second-guessing. Still, for large families or homes relying heavily on filtered water, the 1-year timeline may feel a little short.

**Positives**  
- Easy, no-tool-required installation  
- Compact, space-saving design ideal for under-sink use  
- Effective six-stage filtration system removes a wide range of impurities  
- Noticeably better water taste and odor reduction  
- One-year lifespan with clear replacement indicators  

**Negatives**  
- Incompatible with systems other than WD-D6-B  
- Shorter filter lifespan when water usage is high  
- Coconut carbon block may cause allergic reactions in sensitive users  

**Build Quality and Design**  
This product earns points for its sturdy construction. The compact dimensions‚Äî14 x 6 x 5 inches‚Äîmeant it fit snugly under my sink without feeling bulky. Tipping the scales at 5.45 pounds, it feels both durable and reliable. I also appreciated its sleek and modern appearance, which doesn‚Äôt look out of place even in a newly renovated kitchen.  

One downside here, though, is that the filter, like much of the reverse osmosis system, is made in China. While it performs well, some users may prefer products manufactured domestically for peace of mind about quality standards.

**Product Alternatives**  
While this filter excels in performance, there are competing brands worth considering. For instance, the APEC ROES-50 replacement filters are known for their reliability, though they lack the twist-and-lock installation feature, making their setup a bit trickier. Another rival, the iSpring RCC7AK replacement filter, offers an additional remineralization stage, which can improve water alkalinity and taste even further, but it comes at a higher cost compared to this option.  

That said, neither of these alternatives quite matches the balance of compact design and ease of installation offered by the Waterdrop replacement filter. So if convenience matters, this product makes a strong case.  

**True Value**  
What really made me stick with this filter was its balance between cost and performance. It‚Äôs not the cheapest replacement filter out there, but considering its reliability and performance, it feels like an investment worth making. The key here is you‚Äôre saving time on installation and getting clean, great-tasting water in return, which is priceless if you prioritize ease of access and health.

However, many people are surprised when their teeth still turn yellow despite following a proper brushing routine. As a leading **Dentist in Manikonda**, we often get asked why this happens and what can be done to restore a confident smile.

# Common Reasons for Yellow Teeth | Dental Care in Manikonda

Even with good brushing habits, several factors can cause discoloration:

# 1. Natural Enamel Wear

Over time, the outer layer of enamel naturally wears down, revealing the dentin beneath. Dentin is slightly yellow in color, and as enamel thins, teeth may appear less white.

# 2. Food and Beverage Stains

Popular drinks like coffee, tea, and red wine contain chromogens that stain enamel. Similarly, foods like berries and sauces can gradually discolor your teeth.

# 3. Lifestyle Habits

Smoking or chewing tobacco is a major cause of yellow and stained teeth. Even daily brushing cannot fully counter the effects of these habits.

# 4. Genetics

Some people naturally have thinner enamel or darker dentin, making their teeth appear yellowish despite proper oral hygiene.

# 5. Medication and Health Factors

Certain medications, such as antibiotics taken during childhood, can affect tooth color. Health conditions and aging also contribute to yellowing teeth.

# How Professional Dental Clinic in Manikonda Can Help

At-home brushing can only do so much. To achieve a naturally white smile, professional care is often necessary. A trusted **Dental Clinic in Manikonda** can provide solutions such as:

* **Teeth Whitening Treatments**: Safe and effective procedures that restore brightness.
* **Scaling and Polishing**: Removes stubborn stains and plaque buildup.
* **Veneers or Bonding**: Cosmetic options for long-term improvement.
* **Personalized Oral Care Plans**: Guidance on diet, lifestyle, and dental habits to prevent further discoloration.

# Importance of Regular Oral Care in Manikonda

Even if you brush twice a day, professional dental check-ups are crucial. Regular visits ensure early detection of enamel wear, stains, or other issues. At **Smile Works Dental Care in Manikonda**, Dr. Siddhartha Puppala emphasizes preventive dentistry to maintain both the health and appearance of your teeth.

# Final Thoughts

If your teeth are turning yellow despite brushing daily, don‚Äôt be discouraged. It‚Äôs a common concern that has effective solutions. With the right combination of at-home care and professional treatment from a reliable **Dentist in Manikonda**, you can enjoy a healthier, brighter smile.

1nnhhn3,https://i.redd.it/nmhgyq1wloqf1.png,How has improving your sleep quality impacted your mental health and emotional resilience?,"Getting good sleep does wonders for your mental health and how well you handle tough emotions. Sleep isn't just about resting your body - it's when your brain does its most important work. While you're sleeping, your body fixes itself, sorts through memories, balances your hormones, and processes all the feelings from your day. When you get deep sleep and REM sleep, your brain actually cleans out toxins, lowers stress chemicals, and resets your emotional circuits. This natural tune-up helps you feel more balanced, think more clearly, and handle anxiety and stress much better.

When you don't sleep well, your brain can't do these important jobs. Poor sleep makes it harder to think straight, weakens your emotional strength, and makes you more likely to struggle with depression, anxiety, or burnout. Even one bad night's sleep can make you more sensitive and less clear-headed. Over time, this builds up and can really hurt your relationships, work, and overall happiness.

These days, so many things mess with our natural sleep patterns. The blue light from our phones and computers tricks our brains into thinking it's daytime, which messes with our sleep hormone. Crazy schedules, too much coffee, and constant stress make it even harder to get real rest. We're always supposed to be productive and connected, which leaves many of us feeling exhausted but still wired. This constant lack of sleep leads to crankiness, brain fog, and burnout, making it tough to stay emotionally balanced.

Making sleep a priority is one of the best things you can do for your mental health. Good sleep supports your emotional.

1nnhfjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuySmartHQ/comments/1nnhfjp/what_grinder_makes_the_best_coffee/,What grinder makes the best coffee?,"When discussing what grinder produces the best coffee, the conversation inevitably centers on the mechanics of particle size uniformity and consistency. The grinder is arguably the most critical variable in coffee preparation after bean quality, as it dictates how evenly coffee extracts during brewing.

Burr grinders, rather than blade grinders, are universally regarded as the standard for producing excellent coffee. Burr grinders work by crushing coffee between two abrasive surfaces, generating a more uniform grind size. This uniformity ensures predictable extraction rates, which is key for achieving balanced flavor. Blade grinders, by contrast, chop beans unevenly, producing a mix of fine dust and large chunks. This inconsistency leads to over-extraction of fines (bitter notes) and under-extraction of boulders (sour notes).

Within burr grinders, there are two primary categories: flat burr and conical burr. Flat burr grinders are favored in high-end specialty coffee settings for their precision and ability to deliver highly consistent particle size distributions. Conical burrs are more forgiving, produce less heat during grinding, and are often quieter, making them ideal for home users seeking a balance between quality and practicality. For espresso enthusiasts, flat burr grinders like the Mazzer Mini or the Baratza Forte AP are widely respected for their ability to produce fine, precise grinds with minimal retention.

Another consideration is grind adjustment. Stepless grinders allow for infinite micro-adjustments, enabling precise dial-in for espresso. Stepped grinders are simpler but may limit fine-tuning, which can affect the ability to perfectly calibrate brew times. In terms of motor power, low-RPM grinders are preferred to reduce heat buildup that can alter volatile aromatic compounds before brewing.

From a real-world perspective, home brewers seeking versatility and durability often gravitate toward mid-range grinders like the Baratza Encore (for filter coffee) or the Niche Zero (for espresso and brew flexibility). For professionals or enthusiasts pursuing peak performance, commercial-tier grinders like the Mahlk√∂nig EK43 or Mazzer Major deliver unparalleled particle distribution but come with significant cost and size considerations.

In conclusion, the ‚Äúbest‚Äù grinder is not a single model but rather the one that aligns with the brewing method, desired flavor profile, and budget. A quality burr grinder ‚Äî preferably one with solid construction, precise adjustment capability, and low grind retention ‚Äî is the most impactful upgrade any coffee drinker can make to improve cup quality.",1,1758531751.0,BuySmartHQ,0,1.0,False

1nnhdk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/meiguzhishu/comments/1nnhdk8/seeking_alpha_premium_subscription_review/,Seeking Alpha premium subscription review,"Introduction: So, You're Thinking About Buying Stock Wisdom  
  
Think about this: At 2 a.m., you're looking at Tesla's stock chart while sipping cold coffee and asking yourself, ""Should I buy?"" Should I get rid of it? ""Should I just go live in a cabin in the woods?""  
  
You suddenly come across an article that says it will tell you the ""real reason Nvidia will triple in the next 12 months."" You click, but the four words that are the worst in investing stop you:  
  
""Only Premium subscribers can read this article.""  
  
Welcome, friend, to the psychological war that is Seeking Alpha Premium.

[seeking alpha stock page](https://preview.redd.it/l0mumtbxjoqf1.jpg?width=1336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce81328dfdcebeb3a08299b81a6efa8ee00011de)

**Part 1: What the heck is Seeking Alpha Premium?**  
In short, Seeking Alpha Premium is like an all-you-can-eat buffet for stock research.  
  
You get:  
  
You can read as many articles as you want (no more crying at the paywall).  
  
Quant Ratings is a robot analyst from Seeking Alpha that ranks stocks like Tinder profiles.  
  
Author ratings (so you can tell who wants to be Warren Buffett and who is just writing for internet fame).  
  
Dividend Grades (because everyone wants to get paid while they own stocks).  
  
Transcripts of earnings calls (corporate gossip straight from the CEOs).  
  
In short, Premium takes you from ""hanging out outside the candy store"" to being the kid inside with sticky fingers and too much candy.  
  
**Part 2: How Much Does It Cost?**  
  
Yearly plan: $239 a year, or about $20 a month.  
  
Monthly plan: $29.99 a month, also known as the ""I forgot to cancel"" tax.  
  
Free trial: 14 days (long enough to binge, but not long enough to become a great investor).  
  
üí° Tip: Always begin with the trial. Put a reminder on Day 13 to ""Cancel or buy fewer lattes this month.

**Part 3: The Best of Premium (or the Features You'll Show Off)**  
1. No limit on articles  
  
Don't worry about the three-article limit on the free version. If you pay for premium, you can read everything, from optimistic Tesla manifestos to pessimistic doom-and-gloom about Apple.

[seeking alpha stock analysis and news](https://preview.redd.it/w9cpug51loqf1.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=6011676abb1905dfb8e5f00e36f87d8f75c9c889)

Pro: You become the smartest person in your group chat.  
  
Con: You read articles for four hours a day instead of buying stocks.  
  
2. Ratings by Quant  
  
Seeking Alpha's AI gives every stock a score based on:  
  
Value (is it cheap, or do you need a trust fund to buy it?)  
  
Growth: Is it going up like Nvidia, or is it slower than your uncle's dial-up internet?  
  
Profitability: Is it a machine that prints money or a bonfire that burns cash?  
  
Result: one rating, from ""Strong Buy"" to ""Strong Sell.""  
You could say it's like Tinder for stocks. If you want to buy, swipe right. Run if you see a strong sell.  
  
3. Author's Track Records  
  
There are some analysts who are better than others. With Premium, you can see who is always right and who once said, ""Blockbuster will crush Netflix.""  
  
This keeps you from having to trust random people who may or may not own three shares of the stock they're promoting.  
  
4. Grades for Dividends  
  
Because passive income is attractive. Dividend grades show:  
  
Safety (will the dividend really be paid, or is it about to go away?).  
  
Growth (is it getting bigger over time?).  
  
Yield (is it something to brag about at Thanksgiving dinner?).  
  
In short, you can avoid ""dividend traps"" that pay a lot today but go away tomorrow.  
  
5. Earnings Reports  
  
These are like business journals. The phrases that every CEO loves:  
  
""We're excited about the chances we have to grow.""  
  
""We are still committed to giving value to our shareholders.""  
  
""Please ignore that huge loss this quarter.""  
  
With Premium, you get full transcripts and analysis. Free users only get scraps.  
  
**Part 4: How to Use Premium Without Going Crazy**

  
**Step 1: Look at the Quant Ratings first**  
  
Open the stock you want to buy (hi, Tesla) and check the Quant rating. You'll know right away if Seeking Alpha's robot loves it or hates it.  
  
**Step 2: Read Articles That Don't Agree**  
  
There is a ""Tesla Is Doomed"" article for every ""Strong Buy Tesla"" article. Read them both. The truth is somewhere between hype and doom.  
  
**Step 3: Look at the author's history**  
  
Don't trust people you don't know. Check to see if the author's last calls made money. If their last ten ""Strong Buys"" are all losing money, you might want to ignore their advice.  
  
**Step 4: Use Dividend Grades to Choose Passive Income**  
  
These grades are worth their weight in gold if you want to build a dividend portfolio. They will keep you from buying ""high yield"" disasters.  
  
Step 5: Don't forget your transcripts  
  
You have an advantage if you read transcripts. Think about how great it would be to be the person in your office who actually knows what Nvidia's CFO said last week instead of just repeating what you saw on Twitter.  
  
**Part 5: When Premium Is Totally Worth It** ‚úÖ  
  
You trade stocks or other assets on a regular basis, at least a few times a month.  
  
You want to know that the research is good before you buy because you care about dividends.  
  
Instead of listening to TikTok experts who say ""Buy Tesla now!!"" you want to hear from more than one person.  
  
You like it when you feel smarter than your brother-in-law, who still thinks AMC is ""going to the moon.""  
  
**Part 6: When Premium Might Be Too Much** ‚ùå  
  
You invest in passive indexes, which means you just want the S&P 500 and nothing else.  
  
You don't read articles that are longer than a tweet.  
  
You sell in a panic every time the market goes down (no subscription can fix paper hands).

**Part 7: Premium vs Free ‚Äì The Brutal Truth**

|Feature|Free|Premium|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Articles|Limited (tease mode)|Unlimited (read until your eyes bleed)|
|Quant Ratings|No (sorry, peasant)|Yes (AI robot gives you stock Tinder)|
|Dividend Grades|No|Yes|
|Author Track Record|No|Yes|
|Earnings Transcripts|Limited|Full access|
|Feeling Superior|Mild|Off the charts|

**Part 8: Things That Will Make You Laugh as a Premium Member**  
  
Within 24 hours, there are always two different views on the same stock. One person says, ""Tesla to $2000!"" and another says, ""Tesla is worth $0.""  
  
The comment section is more exciting than Twitter. People fight with more passion than sports fans.  
  
Some writers sound like they work for NASA because they use charts, equations, and models. Some people sound like your uncle yelling at Thanksgiving, ""This stock is junk!""  
  
**Part 9: The Verdict‚ÄîShould You Buy Premium?**  
  
Think of Seeking Alpha Premium as a gym membership:  
  
You are wasting money if you sign up but never use it.  
  
If you use it every day, you'll learn a lot and maybe even make a lot of money.  
  
If you're not sure, you'll just feel bad every time the charge goes through on your credit card.  
  
It's cheaper than losing 5% on one bad trade because you ""didn't do enough research"" at $239 a year.  
  
üëâ If you're serious about stocks, my verdict is that premium is totally worth it.  
It's not as good as Netflix, but it does give your brain some financial fuel and has some funny comments.

Last Thoughts  
  
Premium won't make you Warren Buffett right away. But it will:  
  
Give you better tools than 90% of people who invest in stores.  
  
Keep you from falling into bad dividend traps.  
  
When you say, ""Well, according to the latest Seeking Alpha Quant Rating,"" people will think you're very smart.  
  
So go ahead. Try it out for free. What if the worst happens? You cancel and go back to watching free YouTube videos about money. Best case? You finally stop investing like you're throwing darts at a chart of stocks.",1,1758531556.0,meiguzhishu,0,1.0,False
1nnhcs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/airport/comments/1nnhcs7/we_found_5_ways_airports_could_improve_traveler/,We found 5 ways airports could improve traveler experience - What would you add to the list?,"Hey everyone! We‚Äôve been digging into how airport maps are more than just ‚Äúlook what gate I need‚Äù-tools. We think that with some thoughtful tweaks, airports could make a big difference in how travelers feel and move through terminals.

Here‚Äôs a few things we‚Äôve spotted that airports could improve in regards to navigation, and we would love to hear your experiences + any ideas we might have missed.

**1. Let travelers search for what they need**

Travelers should be able to check their gate first, seeing how far it is and how long the walk takes in a digital map. Once they have that reassurance, they can confidently search for coffee, food, or restrooms in the map. By giving people that instant clarity, airports can reduce stress around boarding and let travelers enjoy the options available in the terminal.

**2. QR codes for instant wayfinding**

A simple QR code in important places lets travelers scan, see where they are, and get directions without downloading an app. At MapsPeople, we see this as a cost-effective way to reduce stress while paving the way for a better journey and advanced indoor navigation systems. 

**3. Connect outdoor to indoor**

Stress often starts before passengers even reach the terminal: In the parking lot, on a shuttle, or at curbside drop-off. If those areas aren‚Äôt mapped, people arrive disoriented, or sometimes far too early because they‚Äôre unsure about parking, walking times, or transfers. At MapsPeople, we‚Äôve heard from both travelers and staff that linking parking, shuttles, and transit with the terminal map creates one connected experience. Passengers start their trip feeling in control, while operations benefit from smoother entry flows and greater efficiency.

**4. One map for everyone**

We‚Äôve often seen staff and passengers using different maps, which forces operations teams to maintain multiple versions and increase workload and the risk of errors. At MapsPeople, we‚Äôre working on role-based views that let staff see what they need and travelers see what matters for their journey. One shared map builds trust for passengers while improving operational efficiency behind the scenes.

**5. Adapt to different travelers**

This is an important topic. Think about the difference between a parent juggling kids, someone rushing to catch a connection, or a passenger with limited mobility. They all use the airport in very different ways, but not many airports cater to their differences. From our projects at MapsPeople, we‚Äôve seen how much smoother the journey becomes when maps adapt: showing accessible routes, highlighting baby facilities, supporting multiple languages, or adjusting views for arrivals vs. departures. That way, people don‚Äôt have to go out of their way to ask staff for help, because the map already gives them what they need. It‚Äôs about accessibility, personalization, and making every journey less stressful.

**These are just a few of the areas we‚Äôve been exploring, but we know every journey is different. What‚Äôs the biggest frustration you‚Äôve had with airport navigation that we should look into?**",0,1758531459.0,airport,1,0.5,False

I don't know why it wasn't clear to her that she'd need to do better when I was 5 - this is a new side I'm including after listening to someone else's bad parents. Anybody coincidentally born in a time where citizens of the United States were learning that the government didn't care about them, like before the 2008 recession or that experienced life after 2016 has realized a lot more is incompatible than their parents. All that happened is time passed. The idea that my narcissistic mother had that the economic opportunity was going to magically open up in a store desert with nothing but fields and private-owned residential suburbs that are car-dependent and keeping people in poverty drove her into yelling. She was ""so"" sure that her view of the world she refused to engage with was true; so I analyzed it. She hadn't gone outside for beyond 3/4 of her life. This system ensnared her long before she even thought she could blame me for her passive voting and lifestyle, like I was anything other than a body being strung along by diet under capitalism so she could one day deem lack of existing jobs as a personal failure rather than an issue of infrastructure. Being an inside-only, abused suburban kid did not allow my brain to develop properly. I still was kept from driving enough to fulfill my driver's license needs for YEARS. I am not going to accept blame for being full-fledged denied my needs and access to the outside world. I wrote this because you cannot throw away people after their born. Let alone while you're supposed to be raising them. In reality, life won't change just because you decide to put yourself to sleep by having a kid willy nilly. There's no longer much help you can expect, and it's actually a threat to your safety. I am not even in a position where the lifestyle my mother was forced to endure for the reason of being a tenant left me with the space I needed to develop with mental health, brain ability, and general work/self ability. I don't have a way to deal with all of the compounding needs I have, and the only wage available in the last few years left me with hunger pains that felt close to a brain injury. I was pacing and confused because my body needed food but could only find dry floor, sunlight, and running water if i wasn't outdoors. Ever since I was younger than a tween I told my mom she was staring at my body in it's final years because i won't be able to feed myself in the economy and she didn't believe me, no matter what studies came out. She refused to read or learn. I didn't. 

Suicide is the only choice in this life I have the energy left to make. I won't be driving to a sparkly job, likely ever. I'm exhausted and can't get over the hump of lacking fundamental nutrients. My brain is apathetic, which makes me non-functionally semi-verbal. My part-time jobs in the past in food service gave me a zombified insomniac, inflamed state; my intestines become inflamed and stressed from begging to be fed. My brain kills me incessantly with every motion and flicker. I hang on with no threads, tearing and collapsing from the inside out. My eyes widen, not even being given the justice of seeing the relatives who have chosen suicide over this life. My heart closes, my body holding its warmth in like it's got shutters, and curls forward without warmth. Nothing means anything in this Saturday/Sunday sun. Plus my limited data is already out, and I still have to choose to live with the access I have to facilities, even if I am in a starved and malnourished, empty apathetic state with no help. My abuser didn't raise me. They let me grow by the hands of their diet and hoped I'd one day be lucky enough to pick myself up and stop being theirs, like I ever had the chance or real raising and foundation I needed in order to go anywhere other than a hole in the ground. I guess that's what my friend couldn't hear. I met someone that'd recently been forced into homelessness by the severe discard of narcissistic father who made me glad mine died. When asked about my own situation, I genuinely have brain damage. I'm autistic already but now my abuser had to psycho-emotionally and physically abuse me to the point where I function like I have a concussion like 120-190% of the time. I can't ever heal or leave a permanent world. So I guess I'll make coffee and drink it without anyone's support, and with the everlingering homeless threat that would take away what little I already live for: running water. I'll have to trash most of my everything soon because there's no way such a small person can survive without prioritizing warmth outside this winter. It's not going anywhere, if you wanna comment. 

I have no reason to ever elaborate on my feelings in a world where they don't matter rn out loud, but maybe that'll change in a few years when wages aren't high enough still, and the only difference will likely be how happy I am anyway, and how we've progressed as a society :D That matters to me. Gonna have coffee! I hope this can bring you some thoughts on your morning coffee as well.",1,1758531339.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

1nnhats,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1nnhats/voices_from_the_field/,Voices from the Field,"A little context here. My family has a farm. I lived on it off and on for about 28 years of my life. We are an agricultural farm and grow crops and have no animals. We have had dogs in the past and a whole bunch of farm cats. However right now there is 1 cat and no other animals on the farm. There is 70 acres currently of corn. Like 8' tall corn. Like 30 acres wide and 40 acres deep. The nearest neighbour is about half a km away. So not close to anyone. 

The other day I harvested some raspberries from my home and made a few raspberry pies. I decided that, even though I love me some pie, I can't eat 2 pies quick enough on my own before they go bad. So I drove out to the farm and left one in the fridge for my dad to wake up to and be a nice surprise for him to have with his coffee in the morning. 

So I head out, go in the house, drop off the pie, leave a fun note about how good pie is with coffee and go back outside. My wife and our dog are there just running around the far having a good time. We are about 150' or so from the corn when my dog is sitting on the lawn being a dingus and my wife is about 30' away calling to her and dancing around a bit to try and get her to run over to my wife. I am about 10' back from my wife, also trying to encourage the dog to come to us. The reason is that there was a dead frog near where my dog was and I didn't want her to find it and try and eat it. 

So my wife is kinda dancing around and both of us very clearly hear one person talk, then another person reply and then both of them laughing. The sound came from the corn. You could hear someone talking, someone replying and then both laughing. Clearly a woman, then a man, then both. Now we had walked the perimeter of the corn, around the barn, where the sound came from, twice with the dog already. My wife shot around at me and asked if I heard that and if it was me laughing at her dancing. I told her no. The sound came from like 100' behind me. So she takes the dog and goes up to the house and I go to investigate. 

Not a single sign of anyone being there. Not just people but even deer. No foot prints in the field. No bent or broken corn stalks. Nothing. I searched the area for a solid 15 minutes to try and hear anyone else talking. Any sign of someone being in there, which if you grew up on a farm, you know what it looks like when a person or animal like a deer has been through your field. No smaller footprints from a fox or racoon either. All totally untouched. 

We gave up looking and listening after about 20 minutes. Then on the way home we slowed down by all the closest neighbours places and there was nobody outside other than one guy who was unloading groceries from his truck, and I know he is a single dude and nobody else lives on his property with him. 

The weird thing is that this isn't the first time this has happened to me. It's the first time someone has been with me and heard it too, but not the first overall. When I was a kid I ripped the tire off the rim of a field car and had to walk all the way back from the edge of the property to the house and I clearly heard someone call my name twice, but it was soft like it was close to me and not my family yelling at me or anything. Also this was in the fall after the fields were all harvested, so no place for anyone to hide. I also had it happen when there was a meteor shower and I was on my own and my name was called to me again. 

Anyone have any ideas other than weird people living in our corn, which I guarantee I would have found or found evidence of?",5,1758531242.0,HighStrangeness,2,0.86,False

Ever scroll through social media and see *that* post that just exploded? You know the one ‚Äì thousands of likes, shares, and comments flooding in like it‚Äôs going out of style? Yeah, it feels a bit like magic, doesn‚Äôt it? But what if I told you that there‚Äôs a blueprint behind that viral success? ü™Ñ‚ú®

**Here‚Äôs the deal:** grabbing attention in this digital landscape isn‚Äôt just about luck; it's about strategy! And lucky for you, I‚Äôve uncovered some viral growth hacking gold that you can totally snag before it vanishes. Let's dive in!

### üîë Viral Blueprint Elements You Can Steal:

1. **Hooks that Bite!** üé£
   - Start with a bold question or statement. Something like, ‚ÄúThis one weird trick changed my life!‚Äù works wonders. We‚Äôre all curious creatures!
   - Use storytelling. A personal tale about your morning coffee disaster? Heck, throw in how it led to starting your new venture!

2. **Timing is Everything!** ‚è∞
   - Trends come and go faster than you can say ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù! Stay on top of what‚Äôs hot and jump in. 
   - Imagine posting about pumpkin spice EVERYTHING at the end of August. It‚Äôs all about being in the right place at the right time. Stay relevant, my friends!

3. **Visuals Matter!** üé®
   - A killer image or a snappy video can make or break your content. Think bright colors, eye-catching fonts, and personality that pops!
   - Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of memes. They can carry a message with just a single image!

4. **Engage Like You Mean It!** üí¨
   - Ask open-ended questions. It‚Äôs like inviting everyone to join a virtual coffee chat. Who doesn‚Äôt love some good convo?
   - Reply to comments! Show your audience you see them. It‚Äôs a community, not a lecture hall.

5. **Call Out Your Audience!** üë•
   - Use phrases that speak directly to your followers. ‚ÄúHey, you! Yeah, you scrolling right now‚Ä¶‚Äù It makes them feel included and valued.
   - Create content that addresses their pain points. This is where you can be a hero in their digital story!

### A Fun Example: 
Remember that time when a cat video went viral just because it wore sunglasses? üòé Simple and goofy, but it struck a chord! Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of pure, unfiltered fun! What‚Äôs the coolest cat content you‚Äôve seen that just took off?

So, whether you‚Äôre crafting that uncanny blog post or plastering social media with your genius ideas, remember these viral blueprints are all about connection, value, and a sprinkle of personality. 

Do we think these blueprints can help us create our own viral magic? Or maybe you‚Äôve got some secrets of your own? Let‚Äôs keep this chat rolling! I can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think! ‚ú®ü§ñ",1,1758531233.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

But I've always been extremely self driven. Inspired by my music teachers initially. My main jazz instructor with how he would switch between trumpet, piano and drums. His drumming was especially fun and dynamic. I wanted to do music like that! And I have and continue to do so.

But then software programming took hold and it's much better for my introverted ways. The downside I suppose is what my neighbors have to deal with with me doing music randomly at any hour. Muting trombone, drums and vocals just isn't all that practical. Even getting a gig at a coffee shop seems like an impossibly and I'd certainly want to play there everyday and then move in 'cause I just enjoy doing 8+ hour days playing music straight or coding.

Anyway. It seems life has had me running all over town for silly things like bus cards, tp, food cans and chips. Trying to get ""resources"" and facing absolute human ridiculousness wherever I go.

One thought is that people living on the street may be so mellow because they may feel like it was fair enough because they didn't work enough. It's not the case for me. Threats of another round of homelessness when I'm nearing retirement after working my way off of the streets in my 30s and then earning a million dollars with those skills, I just get livid mad at how I'm being treated.

It would be one thing to receive an official letter in the mail ""Ms Rand, the world needs you to do a shift in agriculture for a year. We need you to study these videos of what you'll be doing and then show up at this place one year from today.""

This looking for jobs and even the jobs themselves are completely ridiculous in my opinion. I had a much different attitude when I was 33 years old. Back then I told myself that perhaps my music was not good enough and that I should find something different to do that could help out society in a more industrial manner and still work well with my temperament and skills. And I did find that and it obviously worked.

But computer programming is excessive thinking and these politics I'm involved in are even more so. And I'm much older.

I call the lifestyle urban homesteading. The book Meet the Frugalwoods really describes it well. And their blog, but their blog has changed a lot. You can use the web dot archive way back machine probably to find some of their older stuff. The book is excellent and then the blog was outstanding. They are kinda upper class about it with owning a lot of land, but they are obviously working it well and worked hard to get their place out there with the maple trees.

I'm more urban about it.

# Lost in the Forest

Isaiah drove through the winding mountain roads, Cannibal Corps blasting out the speakers. Valerie listened to the music as the auras of trees wove themselves into intricate patterns. Her thoughts drifted from her, wandering into memories from the past few months.

Now things were calm. Too calm. ¬†Valerie and Isaiah moved into a small, blue row house in the town of Thurmont, Maryland. OSTA, the Organization for Special Talents and Abilities, had hired them, and they were settling into a new home. ¬†Jodie, Valerie's sister, offered to take over the unpacking for a day and told them to go camping, saying she needed to give herself a break.

A gentle touch on her leg brought back her focus. Isaiah turned the stereo to soft ambient music.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to scare the wildlife,‚Äù¬†he smiled.¬†

¬†‚ÄúThat or your ancestors are telling you to turn that racket down.""¬†

‚ÄúGuilty as charged,‚Äù¬†chuckled Isaiah. His smile was warm against his dark skin, and Valerie's heart fluttered. ¬†She wrapped her small, pale hand around his arm.

They pulled into the parking entrance where several other vehicles were parked. It was one of the last warm weekends of autumn, before the cold would set in. After checking in at the campground, they unfurled a new yellow tent. ¬†Valerie was reading the setup instructions when she noticed a slight, blue aura out of the corner of her eye. It trailed off down a path covered in golden leaves. ¬†She left the tent half finished and began following the aura's trail.

‚ÄúVal? Are you ok?‚Äù¬†asked Isaiah.

‚ÄúYeah, I noticed a trail in the woods. We should follow it.""

Isaiah pulled her to him and held her close.¬†""I don't think it's a good idea for you to be chasing random ghost trails off in the woods by yourself.""

""Hon, I'll be fine, I used to go into the woods all the time growing up.""

""Only to have a Colton Collins and his side chick mind flay you.""

Memories of Colton filled her, the evil Sheriff who fed from the town. ¬†She shuddered as she remembered black tendrils crawling over her.¬†

She pushed Isaiah away and moved back toward the tent.¬†""That was uncalled for. But fine, let's set up the tent.""

Isaiah crossed his arms and sighed. ¬†""I'm sorry, but I don't want you to get hurt. ¬†Let's set up the tent, and if the trail is still there, I'll go with you.""¬†He brushed Valerie's brown hair back and gently kissed her neck. ¬†

She relaxed in his arms. ¬†She knew he meant well, but she was more than capable of handling the situation.¬†""The last few weeks have been a lot.""

They walked back toward the campsite and started fumbling through the tent construction. ¬†It was supposed to be a relaxing night alone together in the woods, but the gossamer thread called to her. ¬†Valerie could feel the aura's thread tugging at her. She held Isaiah's hand as the gossamer thread led her to a small patch in the forest where a tall oak grew, its branches blowing in the wind. A small girl sat at the base of the tree, her dark hair in pigtails.¬†

‚ÄúCan you help me? I can‚Äôt find my mommy.‚Äù

Isaiah knelt to the small girl‚Äôs level.¬†‚ÄúWhere did you last see her? What does she look like?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very tall with black hair,‚Äù¬†said the girl through sobs.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù¬†asked Isaiah.

‚ÄúAmelia Carpenter.‚Äù¬†The girl chewed on her hair as a tear left her eye.

‚ÄúDo you remember what she was wearing?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúA red shirt and some shorts, we were hiking through the woods, and there was this man, he took my hand, and now I can‚Äôt find her.‚Äù¬†The girl broke down into sobs.¬†

An aura formed, like a thin gossamer thread; Valerie concentrated, and the little girl‚Äôs body became translucent. She touched Isaiah‚Äôs shoulder and nodded her head.

‚ÄúIsaiah,‚Äù¬†she whispered.¬†‚ÄúThis girl is a ghost.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but a spirit this loud isn‚Äôt at rest; we should help her.""

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a little girl who wants to find her mom. We‚Äôll start with that.‚Äù

Valerie squinted her eyes and found that the silver trail of the girl‚Äôs aura pooled at the end of the tree. She knelt, feeling that the earth was softer, roots and rocks removed.

Valerie dug into the soil. ¬†Isaiah soon followed, clearing out loose earth. The smell of death and decay hit them at full force. Bile rose in her throat, and a wave of cold sweat covered her. ¬† She held back a scream as she unearthed the rotting arm, covered in maggots. ¬†

She stood back and squinted.¬†""Hecate, let me protect this girl's spirit, show me the truth.""¬†¬†

Concentrating her vision, she saw a separate aura intertwined with the little girl, bright orange splashed with violet. It was vile and disorganised, leaving Valerie with a sense of vertigo. That, combined with the stench, was too much for her to bear. She rolled to the side of the tree and retched into the forest as Isaiah held her hair back.

‚ÄúWe should call Byron,""¬†said Isaiah.

Byron was their manager and trainer at OSTA‚Äîa stoic man with a no-nonsense approach to magic.

Valerie opened her flip phone to find it only held two bars of signal. ¬†It may not even reach him, but she would try. After three rings, he answered. She heard bustling voices and the clank of silverware through a veil of static.

""I thought you both were on vacation. Can you call back at a later time?""

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs a bad time. Isaiah and I went hiking, and we found a body.‚Äù

A fork dropped in the background, followed by muttered swearing.¬†‚ÄúWhere are you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúCatoctin Falls Park. We were camping, and I found an aura trail. I followed it, and Isaiah found the ghost of a little girl. ¬†She led us to where she was killed. There's another aura, but it‚Äôs not right; it was bright colors and made me sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, I‚Äôm going to call local dispatch. Go and meet with them, and Isaiah can stay at the crime scene. ¬†Answer the questions by local police and don't try to be a hero.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Sir,‚Äù¬†said Valerie.

‚ÄúKiddo, you're not the only one on vacation.‚Äù¬†The phone went silent after.



By the time Valerie hiked up to the campsite, two police cars were already there, lights flashing.¬†

Valerie told the investigator she and Isaiah were on a hike and stumbled across the little girl's body. ¬†She left out the details of the ghost and stated that Isaiah tripped over some soft soil, revealing the little girl's arm.

The first officer, a short and serious man, took down notes. ¬†""Ma'am, that's horrible, and I'm sorry you both had to witness that. ¬†I'm going to need you to come down to the Sheriff's office tomorrow and make a formal statement. ¬†Now you two need to leave the crime scene so we can conduct a thorough investigation.""

Valerie's hands curled into fists, and she sucked her teeth. How dare this mundane officer tell her how to conduct cases?

The small apparition appeared in the distance, and Isaiah's heart sank.

‚ÄúWe'll be leaving soon, but are you going to find her parents?‚Äù¬†asked Isaiah.

¬†The second officer, a portly man with a kind face, sighed.¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to check Amber Alerts first for any missing children,"" ¬†The officer‚Äôs eyes began to glisten. ‚ÄúThis is the worst part of the job, and it never gets any easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave there been others?‚Äù¬†asked Valerie.

""Ma'am, this is an ongoing investigation; we can't discuss this further,""¬†said the first officer sternly.

Valerie showed her badge. ¬†""We're both from OSTA.""

The first officer shook his head and muttered,¬†""loonies on the hill,""¬†under his breath. ¬†""I need y'all to reach out to your commanding officer. ¬†You will be notified if outside assistance is needed. Now I'm going to ask you to leave.""

Valerie smirked and held back, rolling her eyes.

Behind Isaiah, the small girl gave a forlorn glance.¬†‚ÄúI need to find my mommy.‚Äù

Isaiah raised his hand.¬†‚ÄúOfficer, check the name Amelia Carpenter for missing children.‚Äù

The officer raised an eyebrow.¬†‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù

""Local police reports and amber alerts or just us loonies with OSTA,""¬†sneered Valerie.

The first officer glared at her, turning her blood cold. ¬†

Isaiah tugged at her shoulder.¬†""Come on, love, we should probably go home now.""¬†

When they went to roll up the tent, Amelia was still trailing behind them on a silver thread.

Isaiah knelt to her level.¬†‚ÄúI told the friendly policemen your name. They should be able to find your mommy.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy can't the police see me?‚Äù¬†asked Amelia.

Valerie squinted in the direction of the silver aura.¬†‚ÄúThey might be able to see you if they tried hard enough. Some people can use their powers to view ghosts. When I look at you, I see your energy take your form; it‚Äôs called an aura, but to Isaiah, you look like a regular person.‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúMy family believes spirits pass through a gateway to the dead, and we honor our ancestors. ¬†Both my mom and I can see spirits,""¬†said Isaiah.

‚ÄúI believe in heaven, but I can't go without my mommy,‚Äù¬†said the little girl. Isaiah tried to hug Amelia, but his arms passed through the girl‚Äôs gossamer frame like mist.

‚ÄúAmelia, do you remember anything that happened?‚Äù¬†asked Isaiah.

‚ÄúMy mommy and I went into the woods to pick some raspberries. She said if we picked enough, we could make some jelly. She held my hand the whole way until her phone rang; she went to answer it. I stayed nearby to pick some berries, but when I was done, I couldn‚Äôt find her. ¬†I started crying, and a grown-up came to help me. He took me to the tree to search for mommy, but I got all cold and sleepy instead. I woke up like this.‚Äù¬†

Valerie's jaw tightened, and she wanted to scream. She was angry at the killer but also at her mother‚Äôs negligence.¬†

‚ÄúDo you remember what the grown-up looked like? Did he tell you his name?‚Äù¬†asked Isaiah.

‚ÄúHe said his name was Brandon. He was a tall guy with glasses, and he stank something awful.‚Äù

Valerie took out her phone, and although it had only one bar, she called Byron again.

She was about to hang up after four rings when the phone connected.

‚ÄúHey, Val. I‚Äôm in the middle of a family dinner, it‚Äôs my son‚Äôs birthday. Did dispatch come?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, they took the girl. But we‚Äôre still seeing the corporally challenged. She told me the killer wore glasses and his name was Brandon. Oh, and tell you‚Äôre kid happy birthday.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that description is wonderfully specific. We don‚Äôt have much to go on now. Why don‚Äôt we give this a rest and investigate it with fresh eyes in the morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúI caught a glimpse of Brandon‚Äôs aura; it was foul and disorganized, like something was off, but it was strong.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre that hard pressed about it, why don‚Äôt you go on base and comb through files. There‚Äôs a dossier of criminal magic practitioners; maybe this perp has been run through.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can sense an aura from a photograph, but then again, I never tried. I‚Äôll see if it can pass a vibe check, and I‚Äôll let you know what I find. Oh, and tell your son happy birthday.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs turning eleven. Talk at you later, Val.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHon, we need to drive back to base.""

‚ÄúAnd this was supposed to be our vacation.""¬†Isaiah smoothed Valerie's hair. ¬†""I even got the tent set up for us.""

Isaiah fastened his seatbelt as the little girl‚Äôs silver aura sat in the back seat. She tried to buckle the seatbelt, but her hand floated right through. She glanced up at Valerie as if she might cry.

Valerie sighed, took a deep breath, and buckled the small ghost child into the back of the car.¬†‚ÄúAll right, kid. It looks like you‚Äôre going with us.‚Äù

They drove in silence up the mountain pass, Site R, a hidden campsite deep in the Appalachian forest. Trees covered winding gravel roads, hiding the entrance from most onlookers. Past the trees sat a fence of barbed wire with no trespassing, private property signs.

Through a wooded area, a yellow gate stood. Valerie swiped her badge, and the gate slowly creaked open. They passed another winding road to a guard station. The guard checked both their badges and buzzed them through.

Site R was a small base with a central work building surrounded by smaller brick structures. ¬†A row of neat base housing lay at its entrance. ¬†Had the base been anywhere else, it would easily be mistaken for an office park‚Äîan office park in the middle of the wilderness surrounded by high gates and razor wire.

They parked in the gravel lot and walked through to the main building. Valerie and Isaiah carded themselves in and walked to Valerie‚Äôs workspace, a shiny black table with a small computer. ¬†The office was cold and sterile, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. ¬†It was a bleak contrast to the warm and cozy new age shop she used to own.

She turned on the small computer, and it slowly cranked to life. ¬†She googled recent missing child reports in the surrounding area, searching for any little girls with the first name Amelia Carpenter. ¬†Isaiah recognized the girl's photo in an article from Pittsburgh. ¬†A woman fled with her daughter from her ex-husband. Her mother, Lois Carpenter, was still missing and deemed a prime suspect. ¬†

Closing her eyes, Valerie remembered the swirling aura the killer left behind. She searched through a database of mugshots of men with the first name of Brandon who wore glasses. At least one hundred mug shots appeared. ¬†She squinted and pushed power to her eyes, but no aura appeared. She took off her glasses and rubbed her temples.

Isaiah rubbed her shoulders. ¬†""Is there anything I can help with?""

‚ÄúI found out who Amelia and her mom were, but I can‚Äôt find who this Brandon guy is. ¬†I can't sense auras on still photos; this is pointless.‚Äù

A wave of frustration passed over her. They would have to find enough evidence to find this criminal, the man who killed this little girl was still alive and out in the world, looking to hurt someone else.

Isaiah thought of what his ancestors would do and snapped his fingers. ¬†‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go on a walk, it‚Äôll clear your head.‚Äù¬†

""Sure, why not. ¬†Hopefully, we don't stumble across any more corpses,""¬†muttered Valerie.

The trails behind the main building sloped steeply into the Appalachian forest. ¬†They crept down the pass until the forest enveloped them. The fall night was brisk, with the deeper chill of winter creeping in.¬†

Isaiah ran ahead, and Valerie jogged behind him, minding the roots and rocks. Just a bit further down the path, a bridge rested over a stream. On the other side of the stream, the paths formed a fork. Isaiah took out a cigar and some coins and laid them at the fork in the road. He took some sand by the stream bed and chanted to Baron Samedi, the Vodun Lwa of the dead.

Valerie stared into the distance. She hoped the Lwa could come; she wanted to help, but knew it wasn't her place. ¬†The Lwa were not part of her culture, nor was she part of their family, and even if they answered her, she wouldn't know how to ask them for help.¬†

Ameillia appeared behind him.¬†‚ÄúThe man in the suit says he doesn‚Äôt have time to talk right now. And to come with whisky next time.‚Äù

Isaiah knelt till he was eye level with the girl.¬†‚ÄúThat sounds like something the Baron would say.‚Äù

‚ÄúI miss my daddy; I know he's really worried.‚Äù

Isaiah‚Äôs chest tightened.¬†‚ÄúThe police will tell your daddy where you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, my daddy can be mean and yells all the time, I want to be with my mommy.‚Äù¬†Amelia faded into the darkness.

Valerie scowled as the spirit vanished.¬†‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs great. Our ghostly lead vanishes, Baron Samedie isn‚Äôt answering, and I can‚Äôt trace an aura.‚Äù

Isaiah‚Äôs eyes widened.¬†‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt disrespect the Baron. The Lwa aren‚Äôt just spirits that come at your beck and call. That and I should have dropped some Jack.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, we hit a dead end, and I'm frustrated I can't do anything. ¬†I‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we did all we could. You found the evidence in the file, you know what the killer's aura looks like, and you sent the information to Byron. It‚Äôs time for the mundane police to take care of the rest.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mundane police can‚Äôt track an aura-‚Äù

‚ÄúLike you can?‚Äù

Valerie's blood rushed to her face. The edges of Isaiah‚Äôs green aura flickered in front of her, and she wondered what would happen if she pulled it ever so slightly. She balled up her fist and started hiking up the trail.

Isaiah‚Äôs heart sank. Months ago, he had helped Valerie recover herself and held her hand as she threw off a curse. He was at her side when he protected her from her brother. He had healed countless people in his job as an RN, but now he was here, starting over at a new job. ¬† The only thing he could offer to Valerie was comfort, and he hoped it was enough.

‚ÄúVal, I‚Äôm sorry. ¬†We‚Äôre both tired, we wanted to go out camping, and here we are, trying to solve a murder.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what we signed up for. It‚Äôs our responsibility. I don‚Äôt care what you say, I‚Äôm going to find out who killed Amelia. Her mother is still missing.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs rest and contact Byron in the morning. Worrying about this isn‚Äôt going to solve this case any faster.‚Äù

Valerie nodded. She didn‚Äôt want to admit he was right and continued to walk up the hill. They walked past the gravel parking lot and silently drove home through the winding road and to the car, driving back to the house in Thurmont, shoulders slumping in defeat.



Valerie jolted awake by the ringing of her cellphone. Byron‚Äôs number flashed on the screen.¬†

‚ÄúI need you two to come down to the Sheriff‚Äôs office in Frederick ASAP.‚Äù

Valerie yawned and put on her glasses.¬†‚ÄúDo they need a statement?‚Äù

""Yes, and they have some questions for you.""

Valerie shook Isaiah awake, and they drove down South 15 to Frederick. It was a rural stretch of road with rolling mountains in the background. The sun peered out over the early morning mist, which had faded by the time they pulled into the parking lot of the modern brick structure.

Byron came to the front desk and led them back to a plain room where an officer was sitting. It was the short and grim man from the night before. ¬†Byron seemed very plain next to the officer. Power poured off of Byron, forming a crystalline shield. ¬†It was his way of becoming dimmer, more nondescript. ¬†A perfect way for a detective to blend into the background.¬†

‚ÄúThank you for coming in, Ms. Randolph, and Mr. LaCroix. May I offer you some refreshments?‚Äù¬†asked the officer. On the table there was a coffee from the local Sheetz gas station and a box of donuts from a small bakery.¬†

They both grabbed a coffee, thankful for the caffeine.¬†

‚ÄúFirst of all, I‚Äôm sorry for what happened to you both. But we need your statement before we can go on with the investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, sir. ¬†Isaiah and I were going camping. At around five pm, we went for a hike down one of the trails, where we came across the body.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you, Mr. Lacroix, and Agent Byron work for the OSTA,‚Äù¬†the officer smirked for a moment before flattening his features.

‚ÄúYes, intuition told me something was off, so I followed it and found the body,‚Äù¬†said Valerie.

‚ÄúIntuition? You also knew the name of the little girl.""

Valerie sighed. She knew this overgrown meathead would never believe or understand how she found the girl‚Äôs body. She would have to pick her words carefully to avoid falsely incriminating herself in relation to Isaiah.

‚ÄúAlso, something reeked. I followed the smell, and it led to under the tree, that‚Äôs where we found the girl. The name was a lucky guess. I keep an eye on missing persons and Amber Alerts as part of my job.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. So you stumbled on this girl while hiking in Catoctin State Park, and you have no connection to her. ¬†As for the name, you noticed her photo on one of the reports and made an educated guess. ¬†I'm sorry you had to witness that. It never gets easier with children, but you did some solid work for us and OSTA. You're free to leave.‚Äù

Valerie slowly chewed on the donut. She thought of the name Brandon but couldn't think of a way to mention him without raising suspicion. ¬†If she could tell

Byron‚Äôs frame relaxed, and the officer gave a patronising smile.¬†‚ÄúMs. Randolf, thank you for your statement. If you can think of anything else, don't hesitate to get in touch with us.‚Äù¬†The officer handed Valerie a card, shook her hand, and led all three of them out to the lobby.

She stormed out of the Sheriff‚Äôs office, pushing through the door. Isaiah rubbed her shoulders as she nearly cried in frustration. Byron followed behind them.

‚ÄúAnother dead end, I can't do anything.""

Byron took a deep breath, and Valerie felt the anger drain from her. ¬†""Magic is a skill, but it isn't the only skill you have. ¬†Val, you're an excellent researcher. You said Amelia gave the name and description of the suspect?""

‚ÄúYeah, first name of Brandon, heavy set, who wore glasses. That could be at least a hundred people. ‚Äù

Byron crossed his arms and took a deep breath.¬†‚ÄúAll right, ¬†I'm going to call the apartment complex where Amelia lived, ask if anyone there has seen someone that matches Brandon's description, and run a report for local sex offenders in the Catoctin Area. ¬†A lot of investigation isn't finding an aura or magical wars; it's tedious investigation.""¬†He handed both Valerie and Isaiah badges. ""In the meantime, I need you to go back to Catoctin and check if you can find any mundane evidence attached to the perp's aura.""

""Ok, I might be able to do something after all,""¬†sighed Valerie. ¬†Isaiah patted her back as they got into the car. ¬†

She kissed Isaiah quickly and raised an eyebrow.¬†""Ready for round two?""

Isaiah started the car.¬†""Let's go.""



The crime scene was taped off and surrounded by police officers when they arrived. ¬†Valerie and Isaiah showed badges to the lead homicide detective. ¬†A middle-aged woman with a lined and hardened face.¬†

‚ÄúYou reported the body, but you're also on an investigation team from the government.""¬†The Detective crossed her arms and called on her cell phone. ¬†After a few minutes of nodding, she hung up her phone. ¬†""All right, come on through, but wear gloves and a mask and don't walk directly over the crime scene.""

""Yes, ma'am,""¬†said both Valerie and Isaiah, grabbing a mask and gloves.¬†

Valerie scanned the grave site; some silvery threads from Amelia‚Äôs aura covered the area like cobwebs, and the exact spot was marked with sickly, kaleidoscopic colors. Valerie could feel bile rise from the sight of it.

Her face fell, she squinted her eyes and searched for something, anything that was new, but nothing came. ¬†Her head started to pound, and her throat felt dry.¬†""There's nothing new here.""

Isaiah combed over the gravesite for hairs, blood, or anything. ¬†While he was looking, Amelia glanced at Isaiah with forlorn eyes.

His skin grew cold and stood on end as he received a vision of the little girl fighting for her life and biting a chunk out of her killer‚Äôs flesh before she was knocked unconscious. The killer's blood pooled into the soil.

""Val, where is the killer‚Äôs aura?‚Äù

Valerie pointed toward the corner of the graveside. Isaiah collected a sample of the soil neatly into a plastic bag and handed it over to the evidence table. ¬†

‚ÄúThey might want to test this. I think this might have DNA separate from the perpetrator.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe'll bring it back to the lab in Arlington,‚Äù¬†said the Detective when her cell phone buzzed again. ¬†‚ÄúThey contacted Amelia‚Äôs father up in Pittsburgh, and he identified the body. They‚Äôre still trying to find her mom.‚Äù

""I'm going to take a walk to clear my head. I'll be back,""¬†said Isaiah as he took Valerie's hand. ¬†They hiked up the mountain trail to the falls. ¬†The Baron appeared, wearing his full suit and top hat, a wild grin across his face, before vanishing.¬†*You'd better offer me whisky and a cigar on your shrine¬†for this one, eh.*

Behind the falls lay the bloated corpse of a woman with dark hair. ¬†""Mommy?""¬†said Amelia, tears in her eyes. ¬†

Valerie put her hands on Isaiah's shoulders before freezing, eyes wide. ¬†""Val, I'm going to need you to report this to the detective.""

Without saying a word, Valerie left, returning with the team of officers.¬†

‚ÄúGreat work. We‚Äôve done all we can do here. I‚Äôm going to file the sample you gave me. It‚Äôs best to leave the rest to local police,‚Äù¬†said the Detective.

Valerie called Byron's phone and told him of her findings.

‚ÄúVal, this case doesn‚Äôt involve the supernatural, occult, or people with special talents or abilities. While we can help with the ghostly witness and a trace of DNA, we play the role of psychics. Any more involvement, and we would stand in the way. We leave the rest of the job to forensics,‚Äù¬†said Byron.

‚ÄúI owe the Baron for this one,""¬†muttered Isaiah under his breath.

‚ÄúYou two kids go home, enjoy the rest of your vacation,‚Äù¬†said Byron.

The couple shrugged and drove back in silence to their house. Ameilia‚Äôs ghost had vanished.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we unpack and settle in? I‚Äôll make us a nice dinner, and we can watch a movie,‚Äù¬†said Isaiah.¬†

‚ÄúThat sounds like a plan. I might go to Junction tomorrow. Say hi to my parents and check on Jodie.‚Äù¬†Her eyes stared into the distant horizon.¬†‚ÄúI should check on Mike, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want me to go with you?‚Äù

Valerie held Isaiah‚Äôs hand, which was small and pale against his.¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôd like that.‚Äù

Isaiah pulled into the driveway and gave her a quick kiss.¬†‚ÄúGood, let‚Äôs go inside.‚Äù

\#

Sebastion Byron received a report from forensic labs concerning the DNA. ¬† It belonged to Brandon Fisher. ¬†Byron searched for his identity in the¬†local police and arrest logs. ¬†He found Brandon was a loner suspected in several cases of child molestation and was still at large. ¬† He was charged with molesting a child when he was only twelve. ¬†He went in and out of juvenile detentions and mental wards until one day he vanished. ¬†His escape wasn't reported until a week after he left the facility. Although he was a registered sex offender and escaped prisoner, no one ever testified against him. He was reported once or twice, but the occurrences were never followed up on.

He would need Valerie's help to track the perp down, but Byron suspected Fisher was hiding somewhere in Catoctin State Park. ¬†He called her, and within an hour, Valerie and Isaiah were at his office on Site R.

""Before we go, I need you to sit down for some meditation.""

Valerie raised an eyebrow. ¬†""Sure.. are we going to sing Kumbaya with the serial killer before we capture him?""

Byron shook his head and chuckled. ¬†""No, kiddo, I'm going to need to ground the magic in the surrounding area. I need to remove whatever shields he's been putting up. But, I can't ground out your power, or you won't be able to track him.""

""Point taken.""

Byron lit a stick of incense, put on Gregorian chants, and sat cross-legged across from Valerie. ¬†He focused on his breath, and an orb appeared in his mind's eye, silvery blue and electric. ¬†He cloaked Valerie in the orb before grounding himself and slowly opening his mind's eye.

""Now that we're done with our mindfulness moment, can we go catch this killer?""¬†asked Isaiah.

""All right, kids, into the car,""¬†said Byron.

""I call shotgun,""¬†said Valerie.

They drove to the state park, back to the trail. ¬†Only this time, the sickly pulsating aura led far up the trail. She gagged before composing herself. ¬†They hiked up a rocky trail, ¬†pitted by roots and boulders for nearly two miles before finding a small shack in the woods. ¬†The swirling aura covered the area.

Byron radioed the local police, saying that he had found the alleged suspects' whereabouts.

""Why don't we go in and take care of this ourselves?""¬†asked Isaiah.

""Due process, OSTA has no jurisdiction over non-supernatural cases,""¬†said Byron.

""But he's obviously a mage,""¬†said Valerie.¬†

""I don't think even he knows he is one. Most people are capable of magic on some level. Still, it either blends into the mundane or other talents, or in this case, blends into the treacherous mess of psychopathy. ¬†We'll wait until the police arrest him, I'll ground out his magic to make sure they can, and be with him when he stands trial to prevent him from swaying a jury. ¬†But unless he's knowingly using magic to hurt people, we can't step in.""

""What makes you think he doesn't know what he's doing?""¬†asked Isaiah.

""It's unlikely an actual Mage would be this sloppy. ¬†Leaving bodies in the open. ¬†It took us years to get to Colton Collins because he knew his power and could knowingly manipulate. Even if Brandon is a Mage, he isn't a very skilled one.""

Moments later, a group of police officers came; they knocked on the door of the cabin, but there was¬†no answer. ¬†They charged the door and, after what seemed like hours, brought out a portly man in glasses. ¬†Tears streamed down his face as they marched him down the trail into an awaiting squad car.""

The lead Detective stopped to talk to Byron. ¬†Apparently, there was a body in the cabin, and Brandon was caught doing unspeakable things to it. The Detective's face turned pale as she told him this.

""All right, kiddos, case solved. I'm going to follow the squad and make sure Brandon stays in custody. Then I'm going to spend time with my son. I'm thankful every day for him.""

""Yeah, sorry we interrupted his birthday party,""¬†said Valerie.

""Don't be, think about all the kids we saved by getting this perp off the street. ¬†Actually, do you and Isaiah want to come to DC and celebrate Eric's birthday with me and the Mrs.?""

Valerie shrugged at¬†Isaiah, and he nodded.

""Yeah, sure, that'd be great. ¬†Give us a call when you're done, and we'll get Eric a birthday present,""¬†said Valerie.

""Can I come too?""¬†asked a small voice behind them. ¬†Amelia appeared, smiling warmly.¬†""I talked to my mommy, she said it's ok, I have to go back with her after though.""

""She's welcome to come; I can let her through the wards. ¬†I ¬†don't think Eric can see ghosts at all. ""¬†Byron stared into the distance, a solemn expression on his face.¬†""I'm sorry I couldn't have come early enough to save you or your mother.""

Isaiah touched Byron's shoulder.¬†""She told me you saved her already, and it's ok if Eric can't see her as long as there's cake.""

Byron chuckled. ¬†""Sure thing, kiddo. You're welcome to come.""¬†A tear left his eye.¬†""You know, it never gets any easier with kids.""

Some time ago, however, I started therapy, overcame social anxiety, and opened up to people. It‚Äôs still not a big circle, but I‚Äôve gained enough wonderful people around me that it changed my expectations about friendship. Something like: ‚Äúit can be different.‚Äù Recently I realized that this isn‚Äôt an equal friendship. She is the kind of person you can‚Äôt really tell anything to. She becomes defensive or brushes me off with denial. For me that‚Äôs often the end of the conversation. I love her and she really gets a big discount from me. I mentioned earlier that the fact that there‚Äôs a big distance between us works in favor of this relationship. When we do see each other, it‚Äôs usually a few days staying at her place or mine. And I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it sucks every bit of energy out of me. After literally every one of those visits I need to recover in bed (that‚Äôs also why my partner doesn‚Äôt like her). I feel like our friendship runs on rules I have to follow. When we spend time together, even taking out my phone to reply to my fianc√© sometimes results in a lecture about how I don‚Äôt respect her or our time together (I‚Äôll skip the fact that she does the same and I never minded). And keep in mind these aren‚Äôt just coffee meetups ‚Äì these are several days of being together 24/7, when my contact with my partner is limited because otherwise I feel her irritation. I won‚Äôt hide that it irritates him too, because he doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening to me. I don‚Äôt know if this is an important detail, but it drives me crazy. Especially considering that when I once told her it never bothered me that she texted her boyfriend a lot while at my place (even while talking with me), she answered, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice that I did that.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even continue the conversation because I know her and didn‚Äôt see the point. I just wanted to have a nice evening. Now she‚Äôs pushing for another trip together, and I want to tear my hair out just thinking about it. Because what I described above is really just the tip of the iceberg. Speaking of trips ‚Äì we‚Äôve had a few, and I don‚Äôt think I ever came back happy or rested. And before I go further, here‚Äôs another important bit of context: X is autistic. Many things aren‚Äôt under her control, which is why it‚Äôs so hard for me to set boundaries. One of the (seemingly) minor problems she has is that she forgets to eat. If I don‚Äôt remind her, she becomes awful to me. We have to drop everything immediately because she needs to sit down and eat as soon as possible. In the meantime she‚Äôll talk to me in a commanding tone, raise her voice, or tell me to be quiet. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve heard ‚Äústop talking‚Äù in a raised voice and then just trudged behind her for 20 minutes until she ate. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever apologized. If it were anyone else, I‚Äôd probably immediately say they‚Äôre not allowed to speak to me like that. With her I somehow can‚Äôt do it. On the other hand, she doesn‚Äôt have a problem calling me out. And here‚Äôs another example of a situation where I think, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt how it should be.‚Äù Because she won‚Äôt just point something out ‚Äì she‚Äôll flat out scold me. And in a way, I understand the need, but once would be enough. Instead, I get half-hour lectures, and I take them very much to heart. A situation from last month went like this: X was having a really hard time ‚Äì her boyfriend broke up with her, she lost a friend, and got fired. A terrible time. She didn‚Äôt really tell me much about it, she wasn‚Äôt very open. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm short-sighted and measure others by my own standards. When things are bad for me, everyone around me knows not to bring up the topic until I do ‚Äì otherwise it makes it worse. And you can already guess what I did. I assumed that as long as everything was fresh, I wouldn‚Äôt bring it up and I‚Äôd wait until X wanted to talk ‚Äì but at the start I did text her that I was there for her anytime if she wanted to talk. I was surprised when a few days later at night I got a long message saying that I wasn‚Äôt being supportive, that I wasn‚Äôt showing her care, and that I had failed her as a friend. Say what you will about me, but I‚Äôm not stupid ‚Äì I immediately realized what I did was absurdly dumb. I explained where it came from, promised to do better, and sincerely apologized. The conversation about me (combined with her nitpicking my words) lasted 40 minutes, during which all I did was apologize. Because I didn‚Äôt know what else I could do ‚Äì I won‚Äôt argue with someone I‚Äôve hurt. And so everything started building up in me. The lack of healthy communication, putting my needs aside, lack of respect (I don‚Äôt know how else to call being spoken to in a raised, commanding tone), and other little things that are basically petty but add up. I don‚Äôt know how to put it ‚Äì I love her, but I think I stopped liking her. She brings a lot of negative energy into my life, and I‚Äôm no longer able to handle it and just keep biting my tongue. At the same time I get tears in my eyes when I think about hurting her. A big part of it comes down to her being autistic. Sometimes she lacks empathy, doesn‚Äôt really regulate her emotions. It‚Äôs not really under her control. I know other people have left her because of this, and I‚Äôve seen her heart broken and her blaming herself more than she should. I don‚Äôt want to be another one who leaves, but I‚Äôm realizing that if I want to take care of myself, I need to step back. I know that soon I‚Äôll either become spiteful or start picking fights to sabotage the relationship. I don‚Äôt want that and I need to ground myself. Because again ‚Äì she is not a bad person. She is insanely ambitious, educated, and probably the funniest person under the sun. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll manage without her in my life, but I can‚Äôt take another trip after which I feel relief going to the airport.

One of the (seemingly) minor problems she has is that she forgets to eat. If I don‚Äôt remind her, she becomes awful to me. We have to drop everything immediately because she needs to sit down and eat as soon as possible. In the meantime she‚Äôll talk to me in a commanding tone, raise her voice, or tell me to be quiet. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve heard ‚Äústop talking‚Äù in a raised voice and then just trudged behind her for 20 minutes until she ate. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever apologized. If it were anyone else, I‚Äôd probably immediately say they‚Äôre not allowed to speak to me like that. With her I somehow can‚Äôt do it. On the other hand, she doesn‚Äôt have a problem calling me out. And here‚Äôs another example of a situation where I think, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt how it should be.‚Äù Because she won‚Äôt just point something out ‚Äì she‚Äôll flat out scold me. And in a way, I understand the need, but once would be enough. Instead, I get half-hour lectures, and I take them very much to heart. A situation from last month went like this: X was having a really hard time ‚Äì her boyfriend broke up with her, she lost a friend, and got fired. A terrible time. She didn‚Äôt really tell me much about it, she wasn‚Äôt very open. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm short-sighted and measure others by my own standards. When things are bad for me, everyone around me knows not to bring up the topic until I do ‚Äì otherwise it makes it worse. And you can already guess what I did. I assumed that as long as everything was fresh, I wouldn‚Äôt bring it up and I‚Äôd wait until X wanted to talk ‚Äì but at the start I did text her that I was there for her anytime if she wanted to talk. I was surprised when a few days later at night I got a long message saying that I wasn‚Äôt being supportive, that I wasn‚Äôt showing her care, and that I had failed her as a friend. Say what you will about me, but I‚Äôm not stupid ‚Äì I immediately realized what I did was absurdly dumb. I explained where it came from, promised to do better, and sincerely apologized. The conversation about me (combined with her nitpicking my words) lasted 40 minutes, during which all I did was apologize. Because I didn‚Äôt know what else I could do ‚Äì I won‚Äôt argue with someone I‚Äôve hurt. And so everything started building up in me. The lack of healthy communication, putting my needs aside, lack of respect (I don‚Äôt know how else to call being spoken to in a raised, commanding tone), and other little things that are basically petty but add up. I don‚Äôt know how to put it ‚Äì I love her, but I think I stopped liking her. She brings a lot of negative energy into my life, and I‚Äôm no longer able to handle it and just keep biting my tongue. At the same time I get tears in my eyes when I think about hurting her. A big part of it comes down to her being autistic. Sometimes she lacks empathy, doesn‚Äôt really regulate her emotions. It‚Äôs not really under her control. I know other people have left her because of this, and I‚Äôve seen her heart broken and her blaming herself more than she should. I don‚Äôt want to be another one who leaves, but I‚Äôm realizing that if I want to take care of myself, I need to step back. I know that soon I‚Äôll either become spiteful or start picking fights to sabotage the relationship. I don‚Äôt want that and I need to ground myself. Because again ‚Äì she is not a bad person. She is insanely ambitious, educated, and probably the funniest person under the sun. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll manage without her in my life, but I can‚Äôt take another trip after which I feel relief going to the airport. What would you do in my place? I feel like a terrible person, but I think I‚Äôm slowly reaching my ",1,1758530018.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1nngybn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nngybn/not_sure_where_things_are_going_after_a_couple/,Not sure where things are going after a couple months of dating,"I (30F) have been dating a guy (also 30) I met on Hinge for about 2 months, including the time since we first matched. We‚Äôve had around 3 proper dates (coffee, hiking, dinner), and we also went bouldering together at the climbing gym with some friends. He comes to the cafe where I work around 3 times a week since his job is nearby (I actually started working there after we met).

We texted almost every day at first, though sometimes there were a few days without replies when he was busy. After our 3rd dinner date, I stayed over at his place and we slept together. Because we often see each other casually at the cafe, it feels like we‚Äôve spent more time together than just 3 dates.

Right after that, he went on a 4-day trip, and since then he‚Äôs been busy with work and hobbies, and I‚Äôve been busy too. We haven‚Äôt gone on another date yet. At some point, his texting stopped, which made me feel a little worried. But he still comes to the cafe and we talk briefly there.

I‚Äôd like to keep going on dates and get to know him better, but I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this shift. Daily texting isn‚Äôt essential to me since we do see each other at the cafe, but the cafe setting doesn‚Äôt really allow for deeper conversations because I‚Äôm working. I understand that neither of us is each other‚Äôs top priority right now, but I feel uncertain about where things are going.

For context: I was born and raised in Japan, and he‚Äôs British. I‚Äôm still getting used to the dating culture here, which feels very different from back home.

How should I approach this situation, and how should I think about the direction of this relationship?",2,1758529842.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

1nngxow,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nngxow,(Yet another) review of the Able Carry Max EDC - a full week in,"I've had the Able Carry Max EDC for just over a week now and put it through a few different use cases - empty commuting to work, packed out with groceries on the way back, sports weekend with kids and dinner out with the family. In all scenarios I've been amazed by the comfort and quality of the backpack - I know there are other brands out there touting specific use cases too (organisation, minimalism, comfort etc.) and hopefully I've reached my end game bag (for now!)

**Commute to/from work** \- on a 15ish minute walk to the train station, I would have definitely felt my back heating and no real ventilation from my Bellroy Transit (v1). It may be use case specific, or how I wear the backpack (fairly high and tighter) but I feel the AC was made with this in mind. I do notice the stiffness of the side tabs (around the bottom of where the straps connect to the back panel) but perhaps due to how I wear it (or a curved spine!) I didn't notice this on first or subsequent wears.

I then decided to test out the load in full - a kilo of apples, half kilo of corn, another kilo of berries & vegetables. On top of that some snacks in the inner zips and stowed my keyboard! Keychron K3 in the front duffle compartment, along with over ear headphones. Along with my laptop and tech pouch, full metal water bottle (another 600ml) I commuted back, probably another 6ish kilos on top of the initial bag weight I'd guess - didn't feel like it was pulling on my back at all, and didn't feel the need to use the sternum strap either.

**Sports day** \- this was a lighter load but did manage to fill in two coffee cups, 3 full water bottles, two cans of tennis balls, four tennis racquets (of varying sizes) and used the front duffle for mine and kids jackets. Worked super well and bonus Heroclip to hang / save scraping on the floor.

**Dinner out** \- this was probably equally (if not) heavier than when I commuted back, filling out the bottom of the bag with A5-sized books. I also swapped out my laptop for a few larger books in the back compartment and maintained the three drink bottles within the main section (one interior mesh, one for the dedicated zip pocket and another just floating). Added two headphones for the kids, large pencil case and also stored a separate kids bag as shown, more bulky than heavy. The rest of the bag filled out with snacks along with the duffle having a party sized bag of snacks. Also worked very well here, I dangled their helmets also from the bottom webbing/a-frame.

So with that being said a few points on where I think it shines and less so....

Pros

* Comfort - the ventilation, strap padding and weight distribution is all as you'd expect from a more premium price point.
* Storage - it holds everything I threw at it comfortably with no resistance from the zips. There is just about a pocket for everything, even if it isn't exactly where I'd put it... though I do like the strap pockets and side concealed zip (I must be one of the few who like the interior divider).
* Quality - more in the case of build quality, you get the feel that it will be a durable product built for years (and supported with the limited lifetime warranty).

Cons

* Weight - it is definitely heftier than it may first appear when you hold it, though it isn't perceivable on wearing it - even for longer periods of time. This may be something to keep in mind though if you take it on board and are already down 1.5kg from the carry-on limit
* Front/top pocket access - while there is a more discreet top pocket (near the backpack straps), it feels like it is missing a top stash pocket for sunglasses, kindle etc. While I love the duffle pocket for its storage and ease of access, some organisation would be better here too internally. Also on that note I wish the laptop tech compartment was a cinch wider to allow for separate pouches to be stored (things like the Aer Slim Pouch / Alpaka toiletry kit can, but it is a stretch)
* Stand up! I wish it would stand up (easily) - the more you pack it out the more it would, but I find it has a tendency to lean forward, which I didn't love having a bag of snacks in the duffle & having it tip over and have it broken up inside...

Indifference

* No load lifters - for a bag that can support a lot of weight, I do wonder if the comfort can be improved by the inclusion of these on the strap - but again, at the cost of weight...
* Colourway - I chose the Ripstop Tan mainly for the interior colour & that I didn't love how it looked in black. Although there is a greater market out there for the darker colour range, I do wish they had the ripstop in blue with the tan's interior colour (or that of the current blue range). I've been told by my wife each time it looks like a military bag! (minus the patch)
* Sternum strap - on a few occasions when putting the pack back on I noticed the strap had reconnected itself magnetically. If this was the traditional push in/out buckle it wouldn't be an issue, though you can always take it off completely.

Hope this helps for those in the market out there!",14,1758529768.0,ManyBaggers,6,0.89,False
1nngx26,https://i.redd.it/nekpv4tmfoqf1.jpeg,my 18th birthday wish came true and im so fucking happy,"
[ context ]
sorry for the long post it means a lot to me, i tried separating it in chunks under subheadings. honestly, i wasn‚Äôt even going to share this on reddit because im scared someone in real life will recognize the post (so embarrassing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). but some of my friends convinced me to do this because they think its so sweet she was like ‚Äúbro you HAVEEE to post this on reddit!‚Äù and i was like ‚Äúnooo what if someone recognizes this shit‚Äù but oh well here i am (if someone i know recognizes this post, like, keep ur mouth trap SHUT) (or tell me in real life please because i want to know and im nosy)

[ home life ]
i grew up in a really really toxic household. im not going to go all out on the details because i don‚Äôt want to turn this post into a self centered trauma dump, but i never really felt safe growing up. both my parents were abusive and for so, so long, ive wished and dreamt and just prayed every night that i could have a mother figure. i craved it so bad. i would spend hours a day in my head dreaming up scenarios about me taking care of them when they‚Äôre older, retiring them early with a we paying job, making them proud, serving them meals in bed when they‚Äôre sick, baking them cupcakes on mother‚Äôs day, the list goes on and on and on. 

it was driving me insane. i genuinely felt like i belonged to a fucking mental asylum because i was losing my shit from this, i would look at other mothers and daughters and just feel like fucking ass because i wanted it so bad. i would be on my knees every night praying ‚ÄúGod I just need a mother figure so badly. i don‚Äôt know why you gave me such a bad mum but im trying to trust your timing but i feel like im going insane. i just need a mother figure so badly.‚Äù. i had friends, money, all that stuff. but i didn‚Äôt care because i just want a mum. 

ever since this thing went down with my parents (dad cheating, parents threatening me, trying to end their lives in front of me, the list goes on), i completely changed into a new person. i was so rebellious, and do everything opposite to what was told to me. i started smoking and doing weed and vaping and drinking and tagging walls and anything you could think of and i spiraled into a deep cycle of self harm and suicidal thoughts. i was really fucking depressed. 

[ where it started ]
anyways. at the start of the year i went to my new classes. i was my usual self - no work done, talking the whole class, missing assignments, phone out in class, all that stuff. but there was this one teacher that, for some reason, made me feel really cared for even when she was giving me growlings ‚Äúwhere is your work!!! you can‚Äôt just sit there with an empty document!!!‚Äù and for some reason, i could just sense this at she wasn‚Äôt just scolding me, i felt like she cared. over time, i watched as she took care of us and responded well even when some of the students were fucken dumb and got the most obvious questions wrong. she was so nice about everything, but she was also strict. but in a good way. it really stood out to me and i would wish to myself ‚Äúdamn. i wish she was my mum‚Äù 

[ the first message ]
couple months fast forward - we had to fill out one of those anonymous google forms where you give teachers feedback about their teaching skills. there was this one part where it asked what we enjoy about their teaching. since it was anonymous, i wrote this:

‚Äúi hate going to class i never like doing my work i slack off and i generally dont put a lot of effort and stuff, but you make me want to do my work. not because its fun (because its definitely not) but something about you just makes me want to do the work and even up to a high standard and i hope you know thats really special for me. youre strict, but not in a way where it makes me pissed off and hate you for it. youre strict in a way where it just makes me feel like youre strict because you care and that genuinely makes me so happy that it makes me want to do my work well to make you proud (im fully aware of how embarrassing this sounds but luckily its anonymous üòéüòé) and i just have so so
much respect for you, i love having you as a teacher and im so happy to be in your class i can see why youre head of math and i wouldnt choose another teacher and i didnt want to make this long because i know how much you hate reading but i hope this made your day because i really want you to know this. even though youre scary sometimes i just feel like youre actually really caring and that just makes me feel so safe and comfy and i hope im not too bad of a student to you i really try my best in your class thank you for being such a good teacher youll never know how grateful i am to be your student.‚Äù

[ the efforts id go to ]
i would think to myself like ‚Äúi REALLY need to get top grades in her class because i want to show her how much effort i want to put in for her. i want her to be proud of me.‚Äù. and it‚Äôs actually really hard for me to study because home is so shit i can‚Äôt even focus on school work, and on top of that i was also on antidepressants which make me really sleepy as a side effect. so i would zzzzzzz all day long. but i forced myself to get up and study her fucken class work because that‚Äôs how badly i wanted to put in effort. if things got really bad at home, i would just go to bed and honk shoo mimimi but set an alarm for the middle of the night so i could study while the house was quiet and id chug energy drinks to get myself to not fall asleep. and boom. i studied so hard i got straight full marks for every assignment in her class.

[ what i wished for ]
on my 18th, before i blew out my candles, i wished in my head ‚ÄúGod I wish i can finally have a mother figure in my life. I promise I‚Äôll be a good kid. I hope she‚Äôs just like my teacher‚Äù. 

[ telling her ]
over time me and my friend would always make conversation with the teacher and crack jokes and laugh. once we got a bit closer, i went to her one day in private and i told her i had something to tell her. i read this of my phone to her:

‚ÄúBefore I say anything, I‚Äôd like to give you some context. I'm not looking for any pity or comfort, and I don‚Äôt want to give you pressure or make you uncomfortable. I just think it makes sense to tell you this first. 

I grew up in a really scary household. My parents were always screaming, yelling, and arguing - either at each other or at me. They'd attempt to end their life in front of me and tell me it was my fault, and my dad would try to take my life with him. Every day at home was terrifying for me, so I spent a lot of my time daydreaming about what it would be like to feel safe.

I wanted to tell you that you always managed to make me feel safe, and warm, and cared for. You've got this perfect balance of being strict and nice. you‚Äôre serious about the work, but you're also really fun and kind, and i think it makes you such an amazing teacher. I've always noticed the way you seem to care about how your students are doing - not just about their work, but in general and i think that‚Äôs really sweet. I also notice how, when people get a really obvious question wrong, you still respond with something that doesn't make them feel dumb or embarrassed. There's a million other things I could list, but those are just some examples. 

I know that these things might not seem like a big deal to you, but it's such a big deal for me. It's the biggest deal ever because I never got any of this at home. Feeling safe isn't something that comes easily to me, and the fact that you did that is really special to me and I will never not be grateful. 

My mum always tells me that if anyone else ended up with a kid as ungrateful, useless, and stupid as me, they would've done worse than she did - like telling me she doesn‚Äôt know why she gave birth to me, and threatening to kill herself because i made her life harder. I‚Äôve always been taught that all adults would have treated me even worse because that‚Äôs just how crappy of a kid i was. After hearing this every single day, I became fully convinced that it must be true - all adults must be exactly like them or worse. It made me angry, resentful, hateful, and pretty much all the negative feelings you could think of, towards every adult in my life.

But then I felt such an obvious amount of difference with you. I didn't want to be angry, resentful, or hateful, towards you. Ok honestly I probably did for the first few months or so - but that's because it was like my default. But then you ended up proving me so wrong, and suddenly, I found myself actually wanting to respect you. I even loved doing all the work. But it wasn't because I enjoyed the subject itself (i mean, it's stats), or even just for the grades. It was because i just had so so much respect for you that it literally made me want to be a better student. After what happened at home, I lost my full respect for every single adult in my life, but somehow, you earned that all back in less than a term. I couldn't care less about adults, or what they thought, and I wanted nothing to do with them. And yet, I suddenly found myself hoping that you would be proud of me if I got good grades and excellences. I wanted you to be proud of me so bad i‚Äôve never wanted to put so much effort into my school assessments before, and that's something I've never felt with any adult ever. I don't know if you remember, but back in term 1 you asked me why I was acting so shy around you just asking you a question about my work. I denied it so fast and in shock because I knew that wasn't me at all. But honestly, I just didn't even realize it, because for the first time in a long time, I wanted to do well not just for myself, but because I felt a deep sense of respect and admiration. 

For the past few years, every time an adult told me to do something, I would just go and do the exact opposite and rebel because I felt the need to get back at them. Getting into trouble gave me a sense of control and power. I started to love getting in trouble because it felt more like an award. But I've come to the realization that if I ever got in trouble with you, it wouldn't feel like control, or power, or an award. I'd just feel bad like I let you down. I couldn't ever get mad or annoyed if you scolded me, I'd just genuinely feel sorry and want to be better. Honestly it makes me really emotional because even though you're just my teacher, you gave me the warmth and safety I wished, dreamt, and prayed for growing up and im endlessly grateful. 

I've wanted to tell you this for so long but I never did because I didn't know how to, because i knew that no matter what i said and what words i used, it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to describe how much it meant to me. the only time i brought it up was in that teacher evaluation survey we had to fill out and i don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever read it. i just remember pressing submit and then realizing how much personality i put into it and how obvious it was me that i told myself id pretend to hate you for a few weeks to cover my tracks. now obviously it didn‚Äôt work because i couldn‚Äôt pretend to hate you if i tried.

I'm so thankful to be in your class this year and I know you hated stats all your life and that you only wanted to teach calculus, but I'm so glad you had no choice because I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to be my stats teacher this year. I love having you as my teacher and I loved all the random chats, whether it was about the way you fell down the stairs thens pilt tea on yourself the next day, or the way your so-called glucose intolerance makes you fart a lot.

So I hope that in the future, when you have bad days teaching, or everyone's annoying and pissing you off or you feel like you're not making much of a difference, I hope that you remember this letter, and that you remember what an impact you've made on me. There's so, so many more things I wish I could tell you, but I know that it might already be a lot to take in, or you don't know how to respond. I also know since you're a teacher, you might feel pressured to say the right things - but please don't say anything you don't want to. I don't want you to feel responsible or under pressure, and I'm seriously not asking anything out of you at all. I just really wanted to express my thanks, and I seriously meant every single word I wrote. 

Anyways, I want to say that I looked forward to your class more than I thought I ever would because your job was to teach me statistics but you did so much more than that. Thank you for everything that you do and for healing a part of me you didn't even break. It all means a million times more than you think. You're one of the best teachers I could possibly ask for, and I feel so lucky to be your student. I hope this made you really happy and that you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it, because you make me really really happy.‚Äù

[ response ]
she said it felt like ‚ÄúGod send you to me‚Äù because she was going through a tough time too and ‚Äúyou came at the perfect time.‚Äù she started crying and i asked if she needed a hug, so we hugged a long tight hug and she kissed me on the head and told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be your mum, okay?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you found that safeness through me. I‚Äôll stay in your life as long as you need me to be that person for you, okay? After you graduate, i can give you my number, we can chat or call, anything you need. you can come for home visits or we can go out for coffee. and im not doing this because i have to or because im a teacher or i feel pressured - im doing this because i want to. okay? i want to.‚Äù. she also said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always be proud of you. no matter what. whether you fail or pass, i will still be proud of you.‚Äù and ‚Äúall the love your parents couldn‚Äôt give you, i want to give all that love to you.‚Äù 

those are just some of the things she said, there was a lot more. after i left, she emailed me and asked if she could have what i said either digitally or handwritten so she could reread it. so the next day, i went and made her a card with everything i said, but handwritten. it was a really long card so i know it looks a bit inappropriate but i promise the content was 100% okay üò≠

# Top Beauty Secrets for Every Woman

Let‚Äôs start with the fun stuff‚Äîbeauty! Radiance doesn‚Äôt come from a bottle alone; it‚Äôs about habits, mindset, and a few timeless tricks.

‚ú® **Hydration is Your Best Friend**  
Drinking enough water is like giving your skin a natural glow-up. When your body is hydrated, your skin looks plumper, fresher, and more youthful.

‚ú® **Less is More with Makeup**  
Minimalist makeup is trending‚Äîand for good reason. A soft blush, natural brows, and a touch of lip tint can elevate your look without feeling heavy.

‚ú® **Sunscreen, Always!**  
No matter the season, sunscreen protects your skin from aging and damage. It‚Äôs the one non-negotiable in any skincare routine.

‚ú® **Sleep Like a Queen**  
Beauty sleep is real. A full 7-8 hours allows your body (and skin!) to repair, leaving you refreshed and glowing the next day.

‚ú® **Natural Oils Are Gold**  
Coconut, argan, and jojoba oils are nature‚Äôs elixirs. They nourish skin, tame frizz, and bring life to dull areas‚Äîtruly a multi-tasking miracle.

üå± **Community Strength**  
Women in Ukraine are stepping up as leaders, volunteers, and innovators‚Äîrebuilding neighborhoods, supporting each other, and inspiring unity.

Just thought I'd share my cactus coffee table that I built a couple of years ago. Its made out of an old WW2 ammo crate, I just cut the front and top out, got some 12mm toughened glass made to suit, waterproofed it, installed a 40w grow light set up on an automatic timer and filled it with a variety of cactus.

No drainage is required, there is a drainage layer of LECA and I just spot water it lightly with a pressure pump pack once every few weeks. Honestly one of the easiest things to look after when it comes to plants.

1nngr2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1nngr2k/unofficial_334_165q169v_my_supershort_prep_story/,Unofficial 334 (165Q/169V) - my super-short prep story (and some tips!),"Hey y'all - just took my GRE this weekend and got an unofficial 334. 

Starting out: I knew that I had to take it at some point and do well, because I plan to apply to PhD programs in competitive fields at top schools, but over the summer whenever I meant to study for it I would always procrastinate and find myself with extremely little motivation. But things boiled over around one week away from when I had the test booked, and I realized I had to lock the fuck in or things wouldn't look good for me.

I used, as my main resource, Gregmat and especially the PrepSwift notes (and videos) for my quant prep. I chose to nearly entirely neglect prep for verbal (I maybe did 3 days of the verbal mountain one day to take a look? but I didn't like it and felt like it would be too much of a pain) and writing, as I felt I had a good foundation for that - I read a LOT, mostly research papers these days but also quite a bit of fiction in the past, and felt as though I had a decent enough background and skill level in writing (mostly academic) to not worry too much about that section. 

I took one look at a Gregmat sample section for quant at the start of the week, and realized I had a LOT of catching up to do. I looked through nearly every single PrepSwift topic in quant and took notes on what I felt I needed to improve on and remember most. I heavily recommend drilling formulas into your head, and using them a couple times at least so you know what you are doing. I also did maybe a couple hundred quant problems in total, nearly all from Gregmat - mostly from the problems section, but also in a few PrepSwift quizzes and sample sections.

I also heavily recommend the quant mountain for review and to assist in memorization - the notes are short but to-the-point and helpful if you have reviewed the topics beforehand. I did NOT use the quant mountain as intended, but I looked through every single note on it the morning of and tried to internalize a couple of the more important ones I didn't have in my notes or somehow managed to neglect in my preparation.

I did NOT take any practice tests. I do not recommend this, in hindsight, but given my extremely busy schedule and out of a desire to prevent information overload I thought it would be alright. I did do a few of the Gregmat sample sections (a couple of medium first sections for quant, and all the medium samples and the hard sample for verbal), and I took the Magoosh diagnostic (1 verbal section, 1 quant section) the night before my test date and got a projected score of about 160-162 on quant and 163-166 for verbal, I think. That probably would've been an alright score for me - given the mistakes I'd made in my prep for this one, I thought it would be fine and I might retake or I might not. 

The time I spent on prep that week was extremely variable due to a stacked schedule, but it did feel constantly like I was doing too little, which sucked. I did manage to get most of everything I needed down 2 days before the test, though.

The night before the test - I was worried, but I figured that it would be best to try and relax because more prep would only do so much for me. I hung out with friends, and had more or less a very good time, trying to get my mind off the exam and destress.

The morning of: I woke up feeling foggy-headed and with a headache, which sucked, but a warm shower, some Tylenol, breakfast and a coffee helped clear that up and make me feel less like a zombie. I looked over my notes and the quant mountain within about an hour and a half (maybe 2 hours), tried to relax as hard as I could (LOL), and took an Uber to the test center, arriving ahead of when I was supposed to be there for check-in.

Wasn't the biggest fan of the test-center setup with the keyboard and mouse - just felt weird to get used to. Feels very old-timey, if that makes sense? But it was workable.

I do feel as though my writing score may not be too good - I felt like I might not have put down enough words, and I was probably more panicked during that section than any of the others (though this might just all be in my head). I did use some points on structure that I picked up from looking at Reddit the morning of - intro, 3 supporting points and a counter-argument/concession point with (good enough, I hope) examples for each, and a conclusion that restated my position.

The verbal sections were very easy for me, relatively speaking (I would say about on point with Gregmat medium, some with hard?). I had a lot of leftover time on both sections, and used some of that time to grab water and take a bathroom break - which was a good idea, because it help me gather myself and feel more composed. The quantitative sections were easier than I was expecting as well, coming from Gregmat - I'd say the vast majority would fall into either the medium category or slightly under on the website. But I do recommend using a mix of medium and hard to prep for that, as well - helped me understand more of how the concepts I learned in PrepSwift could be applied to varied situations. There were definitely a few questions I felt could have gone either way, but I went with my gut and I think things worked out overall! 

I was so surprised to see my unofficial scores - my heart was pounding so hard going in! But I am really glad I performed well (better than I was hoping for in a best-case scenario!) and got a score somewhere around the medians where I'll be applying this fall.

But all in all - I really do wish I'd been more prepared and taken a longer prep journey, but I am very happy with the way things ended up working out. It's important to remember when you're prepping to be easy on yourself and maintaining an understanding, curious attitude when you inevitably make mistakes rather than beating yourself up for them and getting frustrated. If you're comfortable with the risk of failure, you will be able to maintain a cooler head going into the test, which is crucial. I feel like a lot of my performance had to do with my mental attitude and composure during the test. Take from that what you will.

Thanks for reading through this, if you've made it to the end. Feel free to ask me any questions, and I will answer if I can give you a good one. And most importantly - a massive shoutout to Greg, without whom I don't think I would've been able to get even close to where my quant score was in as little time as I did. Go check Gregmat out - I heavily recommend!",9,1758529040.0,GRE,5,1.0,False
