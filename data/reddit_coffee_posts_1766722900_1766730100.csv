Chapter 1 

Claire’s POV 

After my application for euthanasia was approved, I set a death countdown for my husband and his mistress. 

My husband Lorenzo was my light, my reason to live. 

Even though I was paralyzed while saving him, I never regretted, even after I found his cheating diary. 

In which he said he only married me out of duty and guilt. 

He claimed to be suffocating, that every minute was torture and he wished he was the one who got paralysed instead, at least the physical pain was nothing compared to his mental guilt. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, “She was vibrant, bright, and lively,” he wrote, “just like Claire had been before the crash.” 

“Claire had been before the crash”, I repeated this sentence quietly. 

The sound of the door opening brought me back. 

“Happy birthday!” 

Lorenzo’s voice filled the room. He was holding a paper bag and smiling brightly, his tie loosened, his hair slightly messy. 

I smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

He froze. The smile that had been on his face died down as panic

scattered across his embarrassed expression. 

“Oh, damn it, Claire, I’m so sorry. Work’s been crazy lately.”

He dropped the bag on the table and knelt in front of me, his hands gently pressing on my legs. 

“How are you feeling today?” he changed the topic, rubbing my knees like they could still feel warmth. “Any better?” 

I looked down on his hands, he pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. But my legs can’t feel anything at all. 

I didn’t respond. 

He looked distracted, his eyes wandering to the side. And then his phone 

rang. 

The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face.”Sorry, I need to take this,” he said quickly. “Work.” 

He turned away, walking out into the hall, his voice dropping low and tender. 

I watched him leave silently, knowing clearly that he was lying. 

It must have been about the girl he loved. 

Since truly loved each other before, I’d seen that genuine, irrepressible smile many times. 

Before the car accident, we were a perfectly matched couple. Every morning, he’d wait for me at the school gate, coffee in hand. “Harvard, here we come,” he’d say, and I’d laugh, believing him. 

We studied side by side, pushed each other harder, and when the results came, we both made it—near-perfect SAT scores, two scholarships, and a love story everyone envied.

The day before our resumption, we were in a car accident and I subconsciously pushed Lorenzo out of the way. Thus, I took the hit and was paralysed from the waist down. 

In that same year, my parents died in a plane crash and all those multiple blows at once resulted in me wanting to end my life. 

But Lorenzo stayed. He was my light, my reason. He fed me, lifted me, read to me. He swore he’d never leave that he’d take care of me forever. 

When he proposed after graduation, I cried so hard I could barely say yes. 

For three years, he kept his promise. 

Until I found his diary. It was in the bottom drawer of his desk, tucked under old papers. The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

“I only married her out of duty and guilt,” he had written. 

He had feared what the public would say if he abandoned me. He claimed to be suffocating, that every minute was torture and he wished he was the one who got paralysed instead, at least the physical pain was nothing compared to his mental guilt. 

I read those words over and over until they blurred. And even though I didn’t want to believe his affair was real, Aria made sure I learned the truth the hard way. 

She sent me message the next day I found out the diary. 

“Hasn’t he suffered enough? Haven’t you taken enough from him? What more do you want?” She had written.

“Lorenzo is suffering everyday because of you. He is in pain and all he wanted was to die. But since I came into his life, he’s found happiness once again. He loves me now and you’re the only thing in the way. You are selfish and heartless. If you truly loved him, then you would have set him free a long time ago. You can still set things right by making Lorenzo and I one.” 

Right after I had read the message, she sent dozens of intimate pictures of her and Lorenzo, taken from the many secret dates they went to behind my back.

But in Aria’s photo, fireworks lit up his face. And, he looked happy. Happier than I’d seen him in years.

1pvxc31,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pvxc31/every_night_when_i_fall_asleep_i_die/,"Every night when I fall asleep, I die.","It started without warning.  
No trauma or sickness. No bargain struck in a desperate moment. One night, I simply closed my eyes in bed and woke somewhere that wasn’t my room. Since then, it has happened every single night.

I don’t dream anymore. Sleep isn’t a slow drift into warmth or a dark embrace. It’s a violent extraction. The moment my head sinks into the pillow, I feel it. Something inside me tears free, like my bones are being wrenched from my flesh but without the mercy of unconsciousness. My chest convulses as though someone is reaching in and scooping out everything that makes me me. There’s a sound that comes with it too, but it’s not a sound you hear with your ears. It’s a tearing scream that comes from inside your skull. My whole body is left behind in bed, still and useless, while whatever is left of my mind gets pulled into the dark.

That’s where I see him.

Death.

At least, that's who I assume he is. No other explanation would make sense. He is shaped like a man, but he’s too tall. His head always bends forward slightly, as if the ceiling of the world itself is pressing down on him. His body isn’t shadow. It’s the absence of anything alive or warm. Looking at him feels like looking into the moment before the universe was born. His form ripples and shifts with things I can’t describe without sounding insane. There are swirls of smoke that move like galaxies, sparks like newborn stars flashing into existence before dying in cold silence. The edges of him blur and sharpen in a rhythm I can’t follow, like he is both here and somewhere infinitely far away.

He doesn’t speak. He just walks. And I have no choice but to follow.

The place he leads me to is never the same. Sometimes it’s a ruined city where the wind carries voices I almost recognize. Sometimes it’s an endless plain of bone-white dust beneath a black sky. Sometimes it’s somewhere worse, somewhere that feels like it’s looking back at me.

I remember every single one of them, writing them all down. But the following entries I’ve written down are the ones that mattered most. I’ll number them by which night it was in order. How many times I’ve walked in Purgatory with Death.

(1.)

The first time it happened, I didn’t understand where I was. I thought I was in a dream if not for the crystal clearness of everything I was experiencing.

I woke standing on something that looked like glass. Not smooth glass, but thick panes that had cracked in jagged webs. Through the gaps beneath my feet, I could see what looked like an ocean turned upside down, suspended above nothing. It churned without sound. Waves rolled over one another and then folded inward into spirals that sank into black holes. Every so often, something moved beneath the water. I only caught glimpses, but they were large enough to darken entire stretches of the sea at once.

Death stood beside me. He was watching the horizon, though there was no sun, no moon, and no sky. Just a band of pale light in the distance, like dawn frozen in place. “Where are we?” I asked.

He didn’t answer.

The glass stretched endlessly in all directions, broken by holes where entire sections had fallen away into the void. Far off, I saw the twisted remains of buildings balanced at impossible angles. Some leaned so far they seemed on the verge of falling into the abyss, yet they never moved.

We started walking. My footsteps made no sound, but the glass trembled faintly under my weight. Death never looked at me.

“What is this place?” I asked again. “What’s happening to me?”

This time he slowly raised his arm and pointed toward the horizon. I didn’t see anything there but that pale strip of light, yet the moment he pointed, a cold pressure began to build in my skull.

After a long stretch of walking, I noticed shapes moving at the edges of the broken glass paths. At first I thought they were people, but they were too thin. Their bodies swayed like they were made of cloth filled with water. They had faces, but not the way humans do. Their eyes were just pits, their mouths narrow slits that didn’t open. None of them made a sound.

One came close enough for me to see its skin. It was translucent, like the thin membrane of an egg. Something writhed beneath it, pressing out against the surface as if it was trying to escape.

“What are those?” I whispered.

He didn’t respond. He didn’t even look. He just kept walking, and I had no choice but to follow.

We reached the edge of the glass path where it broke into shards. Below was nothing but the upside-down ocean, stretching into forever. Death stopped there. He didn’t point this time. He just stood, looking down, and I felt something in my chest begin to pull. The pressure grew until I couldn’t breathe, and then, just like that, I was back in my bed.

It was morning. My body was drenched in sweat. But the taste in my mouth was the strangest part. Salt water.

 

(3.)

I woke standing on a road the color of burnt bone. The dirt was fine and dry, yet it seemed to cling to itself in a way that reminded me of ash mixed with oil. When I shifted my feet, it did not scatter like normal soil. Instead, it crumbled apart in sticky, slow-moving clumps, almost reluctant to be disturbed.

The air was heavy. Not just thick, but oppressive, as if something unseen was pressing down on my lungs and ribs. Each breath felt like drawing in lukewarm water that left a faint metallic taste on my tongue. It was quiet here, so quiet that I could hear the faint grind of my teeth when I clenched my jaw.

The road stretched ahead and behind in a perfectly straight line, dividing an endless expanse of black grass. The blades were long and thin, swaying even though the air around them was completely still. They shimmered faintly, as if absorbing the faintest glimmers of light from somewhere I could not see. When I looked closely, I thought I saw tiny motes drifting upward from their tips, vanishing before they reached my knees.

Above was a sky that made my head ache. At first glance it was dark, but not the kind of darkness you get from night. It was deep, layered, constantly folding in on itself. Shapes formed in that shifting void, swirling spirals, jagged arcs, patterns like constellations that almost made sense before collapsing into something alien. The folds of the sky moved in slow, deliberate motions, like the world above me was a living thing breathing in long intervals. Sometimes the stars that flickered between those folds appeared to be arranged in human shapes, sometimes in geometric patterns, and sometimes in things I did not have words for. The longer I stared, the more I felt my thoughts slipping sideways.

Death walked ahead of me, his form swallowing every bit of light from the road. The absence that made up his body seemed to drink in the sky’s shifting light, making the galaxies inside him burn brighter for brief moments before winking out. He did not look back, but I could feel the pull of his presence guiding me forward.

We had been walking for what felt like hours when I saw them.

Off to the right, far from the road, stood a lone tree. Its branches were bone-white and bare, each one curling upward in a way that made it look like a frozen scream. Beneath it huddled a group of figures. They were moving, but not toward us. Even from a distance I could tell something was wrong. Their bodies were red and wet, strips of flesh hanging loose like clothing torn to shreds. Their faces were exposed muscle and sinew, and they clawed at themselves with hands slick with blood. Each motion tore more of their own tissue away. They made no screams, only low, constant moans that seemed to sink into the air like smoke into cloth.

I stopped in the road and stared.

“What are they?” I asked.

Death did not respond.

One of the figures lurched, its head twisting unnaturally far in my direction. There were no eyes, just dark, hollow sockets that glistened faintly. The mouth opened and shut, but the moaning did not match the movement. It was as if the sound was leaking from the air itself.

Something pulled at me. Not physically, but in a way that made my chest feel tight, as though the tree itself was drawing me toward it. Without realizing it, I stepped off the dirt road, my foot sinking slightly into the black grass.

The second my shoe touched the blades, an arm like a wall of darkness moved in front of me.

I froze.

“Why?” I asked.

Death turned his head toward me, his gaze sinking into my mind like a cold current. His voice, when it came, was low and hollow, vibrating through my bones rather than my ears.

“They are not for you.”

I looked back toward the tree. The flayed figures had stopped clawing themselves and now stood still, all of them facing me. Even without eyes, I could feel them watching. The black grass seemed to twitch beneath my feet.

I wanted to ask more, but the pressure began building in my chest again, sudden, sharp, and inescapable. The tree, the grass, the figures blurred into one smudge of black and red as my vision tunneled.

Then I was in my bed.

My sheets were damp with sweat. When I swallowed, my throat burned as if I had been screaming for hours. I think I had been.

 

(7.)

This time, I woke standing in water.

It was shallow, only a few inches deep, but it stretched forever in every direction. The surface was perfectly smooth, and every step I took sent ripples racing outward until they faded into the horizon. There was no wind, no sound of waves, just the constant, delicate slap of water against my ankles as I moved. The ground beneath was solid, but I could not see it through the endless, mirrored expanse.

Above me was an ocean.

Not clouds, not a sky, but an actual ocean suspended overhead. The water churned and twisted far above my head, lit by shifting streaks of sunlight that seemed to come from nowhere. I could see shapes moving in that vast ceiling of water. Some were long, gliding in serpentine motions, their bodies too large to measure. Others drifted lazily, their bodies bulbous and fringed with translucent tendrils that pulsed faintly like they were breathing. Now and then, something enormous would pass overhead and block out all the light for a moment, and I would see only a silhouette so strange I could not begin to put words to it.

Death was beside me, walking through the shallow water without leaving any ripples at all.

“Why is this happening to me?” I asked him.

He didn’t answer. His head tilted slightly toward the distance, but he kept moving.

I tried again. “If you’re not going to tell me, then I guess I’ll just talk to myself.”

And I did.

I talked about how many nights it had been. How my waking hours were starting to feel more like the dream. How I’d stopped telling anyone about my nights because no one could understand. I talked about the places he’d taken me, the things I’d seen, and the growing suspicion that there was a reason for all of it. My voice felt too loud in the stillness, and yet Death didn’t seem to mind.

We walked like that for what felt like hours. The water was cold, but it never got any deeper. The horizon never changed. The creatures above us swam on, unaware or uncaring that we were beneath them.

Then I saw something on the horizon.

At first it looked like a dark smudge moving slowly toward us. As it grew closer, I realized it was a ship. A massive, weather-beaten galleon, the kind I’d only seen in history books, floating upside down in the ocean above us.

No, not upside down. The “sky” water didn’t have an up or down. It just was.

The ship was from another time, its wood blackened and rotting, its sails torn into long, fluttering ribbons. Large sections of its hull were missing, exposing broken ribs of timber. It should have been sinking, but instead it glided forward like it was caught on an unseen current.

I thought at first it was dragging a normal anchor.

It wasn’t.

Beneath it, tethered to a massive chain of rusted iron links, was a cluster of human bodies. Dozens of them, maybe more. They were alive, their chests rising and falling in slow, labored breaths. Each one was bound to the chain by their necks, their wrists, their ankles, so tightly that the iron had cut deep into their flesh. Their skin was pale and waterlogged, their eyes open but empty, gazing at nothing as they were pulled along.

The chain dragged them across the shallow water, scraping their bodies over whatever lay beneath. I could see some of them twitch when they hit something sharp, but none of them screamed. The ship passed directly overhead, the chain rattling faintly as it went on. It did not speed up. It did not slow down.

We stood there and watched it move past us, the trail of bodies stretching behind like a grotesque comet tail.

I don’t know how long we watched it. It might still be moving somewhere out there, dragging those bodies until there’s nothing left of them to drag.

Death turned and kept walking, and I followed. I didn’t talk anymore after that.

 

(13.)

Something is wrong with me.

It’s been creeping in over the last week, but today was the worst. I’ve been tired before, long shifts, bad sleep, but this is different. My body feels hollow, like I’ve been hollowed out with a dull spoon. My legs shake when I stand too long. My hands cramp when I try to write.

I barely made it halfway through work today before my boss stopped me in the hallway. She didn’t even ask if I was okay. She just said I looked pale and sick, and that I should go home before I dropped dead in the lobby.

I’ve had three nosebleeds in the past two days. I almost never get them, maybe once every few years. The last one came out of nowhere while I was making coffee, and the taste of iron wouldn’t leave my mouth for hours.

I’m starting to wonder if these nights with Death are bleeding into the days. If some part of me is actually dying, piece by piece.

When I fell asleep tonight, the pull came faster than usual.

The place I woke in was open. Not like a field, not like a plain, but an expanse so vast that I couldn’t even tell where the ground ended and the horizon began. The surface beneath my feet was black stone, fractured in spiderweb patterns, each crack faintly glowing with dim blue light. Above us, the sky was filled with slow-moving clouds that glowed from within, like storm fronts lit by distant lightning.

Death stood a few steps ahead, already walking.

I caught up to him quickly. “Is there a reason you keep showing me all of this?” I asked.

He didn’t look at me, but he nodded once.

That answer was worse than silence. It confirmed something I’d been afraid to admit to myself. There is a purpose.

“What is it then?” I pressed. “Why me? Why these places? What am I supposed to do with any of this?”

His head turned slightly, and when he spoke, his voice was the low rumble of distant thunder.

“It is not yet time for you to know.”

The heat in my chest was sudden. I was tired, tired of waking in strange worlds, tired of walking without answers, tired of feeling weaker each day.

“Of course it’s not time,” I muttered, my voice sharper than I meant it to be. “It’s never time, is it?”

He didn’t reply.

I stopped asking questions.

We walked on in silence for the rest of the night. The cracks in the stone seemed to pulse faintly with each step we took, like the ground itself had a heartbeat. Somewhere far off, I could hear what sounded like water dripping into an endless pit.

When the pressure in my chest returned, I let it take me without fighting it.

Back in my bed, my nose was bleeding again.

 

(19.)

My body is failing me faster than I can keep track of.

I am exhausted all the time. My legs feel like they might buckle under the smallest weight. My hands cramp just lifting a pen. My vision flickers, and sometimes I see things that I know aren’t there, yet they feel solid. I could have sworn the mailman was missing his eyes today, standing at my doorstep with nothing behind his lids.

The worlds I walk through at night are seeping into my days. Shadows move across the walls where there should be none. Faces appear in reflections, and I catch them only for a moment before they vanish. My nosebleeds have become relentless, coming every couple of hours, each one leaving the taste of iron thick in my mouth.

I went to bed tonight determined to confront Death. I refused to move until he answered some questions.

We arrived in the blackened plains without sound, but this time he did not walk. For the first time, he stopped, standing motionless and waiting. I could feel the pull of the landscape, but I did not move.

“Why are you showing me all of this?” I asked, my voice steadier than I felt.

His head tilted toward me. When he spoke, the words were slow, deliberate, and impossibly calm.

“To prepare you.”

I frowned, pressing further. “For what?”

He said nothing. He only stood there, impossibly still, his form swallowing light around him. The answer was implied, clear, and yet I dared not say it aloud.

I swallowed hard and tried another question. “Why is my body getting worse in the real world? Why am I falling apart?”

He remained silent. Not a nod, not a gesture, only the weight of his presence. The answer again was implied, as if my own failing body and these walks were connected in ways I could not fully comprehend.

I exhaled slowly, letting the tension drain out of me. My chest ached, my muscles trembled, and my head throbbed, but I understood enough.

I walked with him.

We moved through the dark plains together. The windless air pressed against me. The ground beneath our feet was cracked and uneven, pulsing faintly with an inner glow. I spoke occasionally, but only to fill the silence, knowing he would not answer.

And yet, even without his words, I felt it. The reason, the purpose, the inevitability. Each step with him is shaping me, marking me, preparing me for something I cannot name. I do not want to know yet, but part of me knows I already do.

When I awoke, my body felt worse than ever. My nose had bled again. My muscles ached. My vision wavered. And still, I cannot stop.

 

(25?)

I don’t know what day it is anymore. The hours of sunlight blur into one another, and the nights follow the same pattern, slipping past me in shapes I can barely name. At first, I could remember every night clearly, because each one was unique, strange, terrifying in its own way. But now, I have seen all manner of things, horrifying, beautiful, impossible, and the memories overlap like wet paint running together. I am not even sure if this is the twenty-fifth night, or if I have been walking longer than that.

My body continues to fail me. Each day is heavier, each step slower. My vision flickers constantly, and the hallucinations that haunt me when I am awake have grown sharper, more frequent, more detailed. They are not random anymore. I recognize them for what they are: the fates I have witnessed on the walks.

I see glimpses of them everywhere. Faces twisted by pain, bodies suspended in impossible ways, signs of punishments that do not belong to this world. Flayed skin hanging from skeletal frames, limbs bent backward until they snap but never stop. People drowning in shallow pools of water that never stop rising, gasping endlessly as the water fills their mouths, noses, eyes. Bound to red-hot iron cages that sear without ever cooling, screaming silently for eternity. Hung by man-sized fish hooks through the neck and dangling with others like wind chimes, swaying with an invisible breeze. Bodies sewn together into grotesque patchwork, forming moving walls of flesh. Limbs twisted into knots that defy anatomy, faces pressed flat against stone as if to memorize their own torment.

I have begun to feel something I never expected. I can almost see it. Not in full, not with certainty, but I can glimpse the shape of someone’s fate before they reach Purgatory. The curve of a spine, the tension in their hands, the way they breathe, it all hints at what awaits. I see it in brief flashes, in moments when the world is quiet and the shadows press closer. It terrifies me more than the walks themselves because it is mine, too, and there is no one to guide me through it.

I don’t know how much longer I can last like this. My body weakens every day. My nose bleeds without warning, my muscles cramp at the smallest effort, and my mind is fraying at the edges. Yet I still walk. I still follow him, even though I know that the horrors I see are only the beginning, and the ones that await are worse than I can name.

Every night brings more. Every night I see more of what lies beyond. I am learning the patterns, the inevitabilities, and with each step, I understand that Purgatory is not only a place. It is a truth, and one day it will catch me fully.

 

(??.)

I can barely remember how long I have been walking. Time stretches thin, bending around me like a fragile pane of glass, and the days and nights are one long, continuous motion of shadow and silence. My body is failing faster now. Every movement makes my head and chest ache.

We walked for hours without a word. The ground beneath us was uneven, blackened stone that seemed to pulse faintly with a light of its own. The air pressed close, heavy with the smell of wet iron and ash.

Finally, I could not hold back the question. “Am I going to die?” I asked.

Death stopped, which is rare. He does not often pause, but now he did, turning his impossible form toward me. His voice, low and hollow, rolled through the stillness.

“Perhaps. Someday.”

I swallowed, my throat dry, and whispered, “I imagine it will be soon, with how fast my body is declining.”

He did not answer. I forced myself to ask another question, even though I could feel the weight of his presence pressing down harder with each word.

“Do I really see it? Can I see people’s fates in the real world, like it feels like I can?”

For a long moment, he said nothing. The stillness stretched between us, the black stone and shadow pressing against my chest. Then, finally, in a single word that cut through me like ice, he spoke:

“Yes.”

The word echoed in my mind, settling deep in a place I cannot reach. My stomach twisted. My hands clenched at my sides. It was not just a confirmation. It was a warning.

I wanted to say more, to ask what it meant, but I could not. I swallowed and followed him, each step heavier than the last, the silence now full of an understanding I did not want, yet could not escape.

 

(The last night.)

I do not know how many nights it has been. I do not know if the days even exist anymore. Every moment of my life feels like part of the same endless walk, and the nights have begun to feel like the only reality I can trust.

Tonight was different.

For the first time, I had a full conversation with Death. Not a nod, not a wordless gesture, not a cryptic answer. A conversation. I asked him, again, why this is happening. Why I am being shown all these things, why my body is breaking down, why my mind is fraying with every passing day.

He did not answer with words at first. Instead, he pointed ahead. I followed him across cracked black stone that pulsed faintly beneath our feet, until we reached the edge of a pit.

It was impossible. The darkness yawned below us like an ocean with no bottom. I could not see the end, and my mind struggled to comprehend the depth. Even the air around it seemed heavier, drawn downward as if the pit were pulling the world into itself.

“This is what you have been walking towards,” Death said.

“Why?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“You will find out soon,” he replied.

I stood at the edge of the pit, my chest tight, the blackness below endless.

“Why did you lead me here?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Death turned to me, his impossible form shifting with the depth of darkness and stars within him. For a moment, I felt as if he was looking not at my face, but straight into my eyes, into the core of me.

“It was your choice to follow,” he said, his voice low and certain. “I am simply the guide.”

I swallowed hard, staring down into the void. My legs trembled. The weight of inevitability pressed on me. There was no arguing, no bargaining, only the truth of what I had chosen, knowingly or not, and the path that lay before me.

I looked into the unending void, my stomach twisting. “What happens if I fall?”

He tilted his head, a movement that seemed impossibly slow and deliberate. His body radiated nothing but emptiness and stars, a universe contained in black. “You will not fall,” he said. “Because you will step in.”

I swallowed hard. My hands were trembling. My chest ached. The pull of the pit was stronger than anything I have felt, a pressure that threatened to drag me into itself even before I moved. And yet, I knew he spoke the truth. I would not fall. I would step.

I do not know what waits at the bottom. I do not know if I will survive what comes next, or if I will be changed beyond recognition. But I know I will step.

And then, perhaps, I will finally understand.

 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

Even as I write this, I can feel it. My fingers are growing cold with the touch of death, the weight of him pressing into me through the screen, the keyboard, through the air around me. I write not because I think it will save me, not because I can fight what is coming, but because I need someone, anyone, to know. To know that this exists, that it waits, that I have seen it.

All day I have seen him. Not in dreams, not in walks through impossible lands, but here, in the waking world. Just out of reach, always near, waiting. I cannot close my eyes without seeing the shadow of him sliding across the corners of rooms, leaning over strangers, brushing past passersby in silence. It is not that they cannot see him. It is that he does not allow them to see, only me.

I have been seeing the fates of others for weeks now. I can glimpse them in the twitch of a hand, the curve of a spine, the way someone breathes, and it chills me to know what waits for them. But when I look at myself, there is nothing I can measure, no form I can define. Only infinite dark. Beautiful, impossible dark filled with swirling infinities of new and dying stars, galaxies of smoke and shadow birthing and dying within themselves. A universe contained in a single absence of light, and it is me.

I know tonight I will step into the pit. I know it as surely as I know that the air presses heavier on my chest, that my legs shake beneath me, that my body is failing. This is not a choice. It is inevitability.

I do not know what awaits at the bottom, but I know it will be the answer. I know that what comes next will be the culmination of every walk, every sight, every whisper of Death in the dark. And still, I am not afraid, not fully. There is a strange comfort in knowing the shape of what is to come, in knowing that I will finally see it.

Tonight, I will step.

And perhaps, after that, there will be silence.",1,1766729632.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I was waiting at the airport gate. A young mother, juggling a baby and two bags, accidentally knocked over her iced coffee.

I knew it would have to be something small to fit into her carryon she was bringing. So, i got the idea that something handmade would be a great and meaningful gift. I hand made my SIL a beautiful bracelet, I used expensive materials, and real gold and precious stones. She opened the present took one glance at it and tossed it on the coffee table where it remained for several days. I didn’t say anything. Not a peep. I didn’t let it bother me. Fast forward to this year when my husband gave me a beautiful necklace which I wore to visit the in-laws on Christmas Day. My SIL was there and handed me a gift which was also a necklace. I thanked her kindly and said that I would put it for safekeeping with my husbands gift so that it would get lost traveling back home and all that stuff. Apparently being in your 40s still means you can go tattle and make your mom go to war for you… my MIL ripped into me when I was leaving telling me that my SIL had told her that I was suuuper rude and I insulted her like crazy by putting the necklace away. I am dumbfounded. I was sharp enough to tell my MIL that of her daughter had a problem with me that she should come to me and tell me to my face instead of gossiping to her mother and God knows who else… but seriously, wtf is wrong with these people. I never complained or made a fuss about how she didn’t even thank me for the gift I went out of my way to make for this woman… did I do anything wrong here?

During this gathering  my wife made a scene where she was distant made it evident that she didn't not want to be around anyone and pretty must just carried a negative vibe all day. It was so bad that my father came over and ask was she ok. I explained she tried. Some background my wife has stated that she is tired from watching our toddler on a full-time bases while also teaching part time as an professor. So total of 2 class each semester with each class averaging no more than 7 students per class. To try and help  with some of the tiredness I have stepped up with cooking and cleaning. I rush home from work everyday to give her breaks and try to relieve as much stress that she could possibly be under. I also wake up early with our toddler on the weekends to allow wife time to sleep in late on the weekend. One time we had a nanny that would come over during the week while I was at work just to give my wife a break. However recently the nanny schedule had to change due to family care issue with her mother. So the normal days during the week that she would watch our toddler would change due to her mothers doctors appointments. This frustrated my wife to the point that she stop calling the nanny to watch our toddler. I tried talking to my wife about working out a week to week schedule based off the nanny schedule but my wife said it was to much. Here the key my wife work schedule is very flexible she teaches online asynchronous courses. So I suggest instead of hiring the nanny to come during the time she would like to grade just call and schedule days for her just to get out of the house to go do something for herself, if that just to go drive, go have coffee or to even go get afternoon lunch without our toddler asking for food. She still refused. I've  suggest taking time to herself like get away with friends or even just go rent a hotel room and pamper herself. There always push back. She stated I'm a mother I just can't do that. Today event made me angry however I'm trying see things from her prospective but to be honest it just making me more upset. Because all the validating of her feelings but still no solution is starting to bother me. I don't want to over react but I want to give her a piece of my mind and ask why she just didn't excuse herself today and just stay home.

I'm looking to take a day trip to Onomichi and Tomonoura in the middle of my trip to Japan. My rough itinerary looks something like this:

\- Early morning train to Onomichi from Hiroshima (around 7:30 AM?)  
\- Arrive at Onomichi, ropeway up to Senkoji Park  
\- Explore Senkoji Park, Path of Literature, Senkoji Temple, Cat Alley, etc. everything on that mountain  
\- Late lunch + Coffee, then explore Onomichi Shotengai  
\- Train to Fukuyama Station, bus to Fukuzenji Temple in Tomonoura  
\- Explore Tomonoura Old Town and grab dinner somewhere local.  
\- Leave for Tokyo by 6:30 pm

I have a few questions regarding this itinerary:

1. Is this itinerary too crowded for one day?
2. What is the best way to get from Hiroshima to Onomichi? I see that taking the shinkansen to Fukuyama station and then train to Onomichi station is the quickest, but also more expensive. Is the time difference generally worth the difference in price? I am also considering leaving my luggage in a coin locker, so maybe it'll be easier to leave it in Fukuyama station?
3. Food recs?

I don't drink coffee or tea because I don't like the taste.

I limit myself to 1-2 a week, always before midday, just in case. I haven't noticed any changes in energy levels since I've started drinking them.

This week however, I believe I had three - Mon, Tue & Thur. This morning I did not have one and I feel like death, I've napped on and off for most of the day, and my energy levels are probably at most a 4/10. 

However, I did also spend 8 hours at family Christmas yesterday, generally had a pretty stressful year, and didn't go to the gym this morning, when I usually go 6 days a week + cardio five days a week (so today normally would be weights + cardio for a total of 1.5-2 hours).

Hi guys,
Let me brief you about my past. I had gained significant weight during pandemic. I was gained to 104kgs at the age of 16 and i worked hard to lose the weight to 85kg at the age of 17. I stopped going to gym since 8 months as i was having some difficulties with managing my studies as well as my gym. I gained weight at this time and came from 85 to 93kg again. Now am 18, i feel demotivated for my looks and my body. I am a bulky guys and i have more muscle mass. I recently started taking Concentrated Protein and started doing diet, but yaa my weight is increasing and increasing day by day. Idk what to do but am planning to go to gym (from April 2026) after my boards. 

Here is my diet plan for now:
Morning- Black Coffee and Doctor Choice’s muesli.

Lunch- Rice, salad, vegetables and source of protein.

Snack- I take protein.

Dinner- 2 chapattis and any source of protein.

(i don’t consume mutton from the last 2 years and am not willing to consume it as well)

I just need your help to review my diet plan and to give me suggestions for losing weight. Pls note that my parents don’t understand this diet wagera so i don’t have those huge budget of expensive diet. And thats all, pls feel free to drop your opinion and advice.

1pvwotm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pvwotm/the_devotion_15/,The Devotion (1/5),"Alright guys, beware with me. This is the first time I am writing anything other than a 10 page research paper for college. Hope you guys enjoy!!

**CONTENT WARNING:** This story contains depictions of domestic violence/abuse, and mentions of self-harm and suicide. Reader discretion is advised.

**PART ONE:**

The first time I saw her face, I noticed the eyes and how they looked through the camera instead of at it.

My buddy Jake thought the ""Meet Your Biggest Fan"" contest would save me. The channel was hemorrhaging subscribers, and engagement metrics painted a picture of slow death. We need something visceral, something that would make people feel connected again.

My channel had always been about connection--raw, unfiltered conversations about mental health loneliness, and finding meaning when everything felt pointless. I'd built an audience by being vulnerable, by sharing the parts of myself most people kept hidden. I posted late-night thoughts about depression, conversations about grief after my father died, and honest admissions that some days I didn't know who I was beneath the performance of being okay.

People said my videos saved them, that my openness made them feel less alone. I'd read those comments and feel the weight of it--thousands of strangers depending on me to be their proof that survival was possible.

That what made the contest--all Jake's idea--so perfect, and so dangerous. If my content was about authentic connection, what better way to prove it than to actually connect with someone? To show that the parasocial relationship could become real?

""Let them apply,"" Jake said. ""You pick one. We film it. Content writes itself.""

I reviewed two hundred and thirty-seven applications over three weeks. Most were what you expect--enthusiasm that felt manufactured, desperation wrapped in exclamation points. Some made me uncomfortable, and most were forgettable.

Then I watched hers, and everything changed.

The production quality was unusual with professional lighting and stable camera work. She sat centered in frame against white walls, wearing black, with her hands folded with surgical precision.

""Hello, Marcus. My name is Elena.""

Her voice was soft and controlled, with each word measured and deliberate.

""I've been watching your channel for six years, since episode one. I can prove it.""

She smiled, and there was something wrong with that smile--not in its shape or timing, but in what it failed to reach. Her eyes remained flat and observing.

""In episode fourteen, you talked about your father's funeral. You made a joke about the awful organ music, then started crying. You left it in the video. You said, 'I guess I'm not as okay as I thought I was.' That's when I knew you were different. That's when I knew you were different. That's when I knew you were real.""

The memory surfaced--raw and forgotten. I'd almost deleted that video, thought it was too vulnerable, too much. But I'd left it up because that's what the channel was about: radical honesty and showing people they weren't alone in their pain.

""You helped me through something difficult,"" Elena continued. ""Someone was hurting me for a long time. Your videos were the only thing that made the room feel less small. When you talked about depression in episode forty-seven, about feeling trapped in your own head, I understood that you knew what it was like to be locked away. You said 'Sometimes the prison is inside us.' That's what got me through and made me feel seen.""

The phrasing stuck with me. Not ""made me feel less alone, but ""made the room feel less small"" and ""made me feel seen.""

Those were exact things I'd tried to create with the channel--connection, understanding, the sense that someone out there truly saw you.

But hearing it reflected back like this felt different, distorted, like looking at yourself in a funhouse mirror.

""I'd like to meet you and thank you. I have things I want to show you.""

The video ended.

I watched it twice more, trying to identify what bothered me--the way she never blinked during close-ups, how her hands never moved from that folded position, the clinical precision of her word choices.

But Jake was right about the metrics, and her story would resonate. Trauma survivor finds hope in content creator--it wrote itself. This was exactly the kind of authentic connection the channel promised, the proof that vulnerability wasn't just performance, that opening up really could save someone.

I'd built my entire platform on the idea that sharing pain created community, that honesty about mental health could be a lifeline for people drowning in isolation. And here was a living proof sitting in front of me, asking for nothing more than to say thank you in person.

How could I say no to that? How could I reject the very thing I'd spent six years trying to create?

I chose her, sealing my fate.

Elena arrived on a Tuesday in late October. When she walked into the studio, I noticed how deliberately she moved, with each step placed with intent. She wore the same black dress with her hair pulled back so tight it looked painful.

""Marcus,"" she said--not as a greeting, but as an acknowledgment. ""It's good to finally meet you.""

Her handshake was cold, not nervous-cold but just cold.

The interview felt rehearsed as she answered each question without hesitation, without the usual verbal tics people have when thinking. There were no ""um""s or ""like""s or pauses, just smooth, practiced responses.

""You mentioned someone hurt you,"" I said. ""Do you want to talk about that?""

""He kept me in a room for three years. He said it was love and that I belonged to him.""

The weight of her words hung in the air, and Jake had stopped moving behind the camera.

""How did you get out?""

""He died.""

There was no emotion and no tremor in her voice--she could have been reading a grocery list.

""I'm sorry--""

""Don't be."" That smile again appeared, empty and hollow. ""Your videos helped me survive. I would replay them in my head--every word, every gesture. All four hundred and thirty-seven videos. I memorized them.""

Something cold settled deep in my chest, spreading like ice water through my veins.

""When you truly love something,"" she said, ""you absorb it and make it part of yourself.""

We went to dinner because it seemed expected. The restaurant was loud and crowded while Elena sat across from me and didn't eat, just moved food around her plate while watching me with that same flat observation.

""I wanted to ask you something, Marcus.""

""Sure.""

""Do you think about death?""

The question felt like a test. ""Sometimes. Everyone does.""

""Not like I do."" She set down her chopsticks with precision. ""I think about it constantly--what it feels like, the exact moment everything stops. I've been close to it several times.""

""Because of the person who hurt you?""

""Because of myself."" She tilted her head slightly. ""Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose?""

""No.""

""Most people who seem happy are destroying themselves in small ways--little cuts where no one can see, little burns, little methods of feeling something real beneath the performance.""

She reached across the table, and her fingers were ice.

""But you're different. You feel things naturally. That's why people watch you. That's why I watch you.""

I pulled my hand back slowly. ""Elena, I appreciate you being a fan, but--""

""I'm not a fan."" Her voice didn't change pitch, but something sharpened beneath it. ""Fans observe and consume. I'm something else. I've made you part of me, just like you're going to make me part of you.""

""I think we should call it a night.""

She stood with that same deliberate movement and leaned close. For a moment I thought she would kiss me, but she just whispered, ""I've waited six years for this. One more night doesn't matter.""

She walked away before I could respond, leaving me alone with the growing dread.

I sat there as my food went cold, trying to understand why every instinct was screaming at me to run.

That night I couldn't sleep, so I searched for Elena online, looking for something to explain the wrongness I felt.

Her Instagram had seventeen posts, all uploaded in the last month--generic images of clouds, coffee, and books. Nothing personal except one photo of hands folded in a lap with the caption ""Waiting.""

Her Facebook was created a month ago with no friends and no history, like she assembled an identity specifically for this.

Then I found it buried in search results: a news article from seven years ago about a missing woman named Elena Torres. The photo was grainy but recognizable. She'd disappeared from her apartment with no signs of struggle, and her boyfriend, who was questioned but never charged, died two years later by suicide.

That article said Elena was found six months after vanishing, walking along a highway with no memory of where she'd been. She was admitted to psychiatric care with no follow-up and no closure.

I told myself it couldn't be the same person--common name, blurry photo.

But deep down, I knew the truth.

And I knew I should cancel tomorrow's shoot, but I didn't.

i just got am immersion blender as a gift -- unfortunately it's not 2ndhand, but i am excited since i've been asking for a mortar & pestle or a small blender for a little while now. (to give some context: i am new to cooking but i enjoy the learning and taking creative risks a lot, i have my sister's old blender but it's a little messed up and not high-powered at all, i am mostly vegan so it's a lot of creative substitutions for me! i value cooking from-scratch & in-season when i can, but i have some significant time and ability limitations that make the labor of it pretty difficult for me - so i often fall back on more ""wasteful"" food as a result. i've also recently gotten 2ndhand toaster oven and thus am getting more into dehydrating and food preservation generally! i also have a handful of food restrictions, but i think the most relevant one is that i don't drink coffee)  
  
i was wondering, does anyone have good ideas for recipes/uses for the immersion blender that help reduce food waste/make zero-waste recipes easier? specifically, it's a ""MultiStick 5-in-1 hand blender"", so there's also a little sealed container attachment (like a mini blender), whisk, and milk frother. i was thinking, i want to try making more spices from onion peels, etc and it could maybe be helpful for that, as well as making squash puree - and maybe the whisk or frother could be helpful for making ice cream?? and i guess it could help in making tomato sauce and whatnot -- but beyond that i'm pretty stumped!!

Can't really find as much detailed info on the Delonghi as I would like. Seems like the bambino is more popular but if I can get away with spending less great. Like if the Delonghi is going to be just as good then I'll keep it. 

My coffee goals are to be able to make something that rivals takeout coffee. Ease of cleaning would be a plus otherwise I'm not too picky. 

I know the grinder is huge too, would like to keep that as close to $100 as I can. Whatever machine is reccoed would love the grinder you'd use with said machine. I'm just getting started so I'd like items on the less expensive side that I can upgrade and grow with as I get better. Having no set up now (I've been on a moka pot) any other accessory reccos would be great.

Tales of a Terran Observer- Jovian Christmas

I served on ganymede for around three months while battle group ' Nova Venari' gathered in saturnine orbit. this was intended as an exercise to expose me to my civilian duties as a UN observer. I had also been assigned permanent quarters here to make my home. It was a hundred meter cube residence in a high density housing district directly connected to a tunnel way and a rapid transit tram stop. This allowed me to rapidly make my way across the maze of tunnels and passageways of this icy moon. 

Ganymede was festive this time of the year. It was after all the festive season. The carved stone walls were bare as always, occasionally having support struts and signes jutting out. The maze of ganymede could have easily be mistaken for late nineteenth century London, in decorative flare and attire.  Ganymede was kept at below 273 Kelvin to maintain the structural integrity of the ice walled tunnels. Humans who live outside a habitable atmosphere have, through tenacity & tragedy learned to constantly wear their soft-shell pressure suits lest they freeze in the cold or suffocate in the event of a compartment decompression. The tunnels where pressurised of course but as the saying goes ' Better safe than sorry'. This coupled with the neo-Victorian aesthetic prevailing on Jovian and saturnine space led to the passers by being clad in  greatcoats and bowler hats over their softshell suits. This attire also had the practical application beyond just aesthetic, such as conserving body heat while the suit's heaters remained deactivated and the air circulated through the filters. 

I triple checked the seals on my suit then patted myself down to ensure I had everything I needed. Then I left my residence and began making my way towards the tunnels way. I refrained from using the underground rail as I wanted to inspect the security checkpoints dispersed across the tunnels junctions. These checkpoints were mostly there to prevent incidents and delays for the people making there way to the numerous cathedrals, chaples and churches that would be filled by over sixty to seventy five percent of the population of ganymede over Christmas day. I took solace in the fact that there was little chance of any excitement occuring as this Christmas was utterly unremarkable just like the previous two year's Christmas. Inspite of this the minister of ganymede had requested the local UNSDF-A (United Nations self defence force army) company 'The 1st Ganymedine Greysuits' assist in ensuring that no unpleasant events occur during the festivities. The deployment was of course protested by the local UN observer but he did not do more than protest . He also privately requested my assistance in the security measures within St. Joseph's cathedral and to be present within should the need arise. This was fortunately quite simlar for what I had planned and thus I found myself following the procession of people towards the largest cathedral on ganymede. 

On my way I took note of the bored looking soldiers on guard dudy and took the time to dispense some encouraging jokes and uplifting phrases to lessen their boredem and uplifting their moral. I also coordinated the supplying of warm water so that the soldiers at the numerous checkpoints could make Dmo-coffee or Liber-tea and by doing so remain sharp and alert. 

After a few minutes of walking I could faintly hear the singing of the choir. The air had a charged quality to it, whether was due to the Christmas sprit or the press of bodies rubbing against eachother I do not know. The tunnel led into a grand chamber bathed in soft yellow light. At its fore under a massive dome hung a cross. The cross was worn looking and old. By this I surmised that this must have been made of actual wood from earth. This astonished me as I did not expect the church would manage to bring it out of Earth's gravity well. More so by the fact I never would have expected such a relic being kept here instead of at Titan where most relics of the church were being held. 

The church bell rang, its vibration carring across the chamber breaking the silence. The senior chior began to sing a latin christmas carol. This was followed by the responsive reading. The bishop led in english while the congregation replied in latin. Then the bishop of ganymede began her christmas sermon. Followed by the benediction. 

I opened my ration tin and retrieved one of the black ration cubes contained within then I retrieved my cup from my coat and decanted a measure of distilled water from my canteen. To my cup I added a small amount of my liber-tea ration swirling it to make a black coloured concoction. Then, along with the rest of my row I headed towards the alter. After praying at the alter for the success of battle group ' Nova Venari's  mission one of the priests came and blessed my cup and ration cube. I consumed the blood and body of the Lord and returned to my seat in silence. The end of the benediction was marked by the beginning of the junior choir singing an english christmas carol. And thus this service came to an end. The service would of course be repeat for those of the second and third shift residents who wished to attend. As for myself duty awaited.

1pvw59a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1pvw59a/heathen/,Heathen.,"“How privileged you are.” A voice crept out of the darkness. 

It’s incredible what adrenaline can do to the body. Moreover, it’s incredible how quickly the brain can use that adrenaline. Before I’ve even seen the details in his face, I’m aware this man is a stranger in my home. Someone I was not expecting to be within the walls of my sanctuary. I take a mental note of my physical state. I'm refreshed, but still wet from my shower. Less than a full second has gone by, and my entire body is pulsating, my heart lurches at the walls of my chest, my lungs pick up their pace and my asshole is sewn tighter than grandma’s stitching. 

I turn and face him. The calluses of my bare feet scrape the tile floor. Several years as a child running wildly through tall grass and gravel roads have made my feet near bulletproof. 

“Move no further.” He says. 

His jawline is ever long. As if he were a humanized cartoon. His bleach blonde hair met with striking blue eyes. With such recognizable features, I question why he isn’t masked. 

I’ve already come to terms that the wet towel around my waist will meet the floor below once I move to protect myself. So I will either lose my decency, and beat this guy’s ass while naked, or simply die in the most embarrassing way possible. Oh well, I don’t have much to show off anyway. 

“To open your doors without looking, it’s astonishing. How you just kept your back turned towards its entrance, as if you had nothing to worry about.” It’s true, I hadn’t looked into the hallway after opening the bathroom door, keeping my focus on cleaning my watch with the towel at my hip. But then again, who is expecting this creep to be there waiting for me. 

“I was waiting for you.” Yep, totally makes sense. 

“Who are you?” I whisper. 

“It’s not of any importance, I’m afraid. What is important is what you do next.” The stranger said in his disgustingly thick British accent. 

He waves to me to walk down the hallway. One open hand points down the corridor, his other wafting at me from the wrist. Both of which, much like the rest of his body, are covered by black leather. Gosh, how did I never hear this guy coming?

I take a step toward the hallway, and once again my brain fires off faster than the speed of light. Within this small step I conjured my plan. If this European creep lets me walk across him, he’ll receive an elbow to the jaw. Followed by me working him to the ground. Then when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll sprint towards my phone on the bathroom counter. 

However, if the man walks in front of me and leads me down the hallway - I’ll roll with Plan B. As he escorts me in my own home I’ll quickly gain ground on him. Calmly speed walking and lunge for his knees. That will bring him down and I can use the precious seconds to make it back to my phone. 

I take my second step, inches from the exit of the bathroom. He hasn’t moved, just the flailing of his enormous hand. The man is not much taller than myself, but his extremities give his body a peculiar frame. Long arms, powerful huge hands and broad, bold shoulders to match them. 

I take my third step, breaking the barrier of the bathroom’s threshold. Then the large wafting hand clasps onto the back of my neck. His fingers dig deep into the muscles just underneath the base of my skull. As if I were a child being dragged away from a mess I’d made, the man ushers me down the narrow hallway. I didn’t account for anything physical so early in our introduction but some men just can’t contain themselves. 

He leans closely into my ear. His lips nearly brush against my tragus. “Where is your laptop Kyle?” The spit from his whisper coats my eardrum.

I hesitate, and slow my walk. Surprisingly, he loosens his grip and allows me to turn my head and face him. “My name is not Kyle.” 

We glare at each other for a moment. I leave my mouth agape, breathing lightly. “I’m Jake,” I say “Jake Fitzpatrick.”

The stranger glares longer. His palm then collides with my cheek. Quicker than any pump of adrenaline, he slaps me again. His grasp moves from my nape to my throat. He pushes my head against the wall behind me and leans in close once again. “I will not repeat myself.” 

“I…I’m serious.” I struggle to get out as the heathen presses his hand on my esophagus. He moves upward grabbing ahold of my jaw. I feel his clutch tighten underneath my teeth as he viciously throws me to the floor. Just as I look upward, my head is redirected to the hallway carpet. He swings again, and again, and again. His leather bound fist mimicking a cement block. I feel my face turn warm, and blood drip from my nose. 

The man ceases his beating and stands upward. He looks down on me and holds his gaze. His piercing ocean eyes grow hateful. “I really don’t know man.” I say as bloodied spit leaves my lips in the same sentence. 

He groans and then grabs ahold of my arm. He hoists me halfway up and then tosses me backward into my living room. There goes the towel. 

I’m not sure what chemical my body would have to release next to hinder my astonishment of the stranger’s strength. Somehow, in this horrifying moment, my confusion outweighs my fear. He walks toward me, his boots press softly into my beige carpeting. He crouches in front of me, “Kyle, I know you’re not telling the truth. Quite frankly, I’m not amused. I will begin snapping every bone in your body… Give me the lap-“

Once again, my marvelous brain reacts faster than any lightning bolt could. With zero hesitation, I quickly curl myself in front of the man and eject both legs into his chest, sending him backward. He grunts as I make contact. Within the same movement I leap to my feet. I sprint into my kitchen, which faces open towards the living space. Grabbing the first knife within view, I spin around to face my attacker; who is already back up, moving close, and really, really pissed off. 

As he nears I slash the air in front of him with the serrated steak knife. My family jewels bouncing from thigh to thigh as I attempt my defense efforts. He lowers himself, crouching like an Olympic wrestler. I try to match his height and create distance. We circle each other within the kitchen’s octagon. As we round the countertops I do what any terrified man would do - I grab a second fucking knife. This one however is my large butcher’s knife, its wooden handle still soaked from yesterday’s wash. 

He leaps forward towards my knees. He manages to wrap me and pin me against the lower cabinets. As if I were no weight at all, he lifts me into the air. Just as his momentum begins to shift, and I feel as if he may slam me onto the kitchen counter, I send both knives into his back. The butcher’s knife lands, but makes minimal damage versus the stranger’s leather jacket. The serrated knife, however, finds a sweet spot along the seams, entering his body. 

He grimaces in pain, and lets out a deepened grovel. He then spins and tosses me into the living room like a discarded napkin. I land on the floor, leaving both blades in his back. He falls over, clenching his fists on the ground. Both objects protrude from his back like a bug’s wings preparing for take off. He again slams his fist onto the kitchen’s linoleum. He curses, whimpers, and begins to sweat profusely. 

He spreads his fingers across the floor, and lets out a hideous scream. His hands then burst through his gloves, revealing black fingernails, and horribly hairy knuckles. 

I push my back against the wall, and then gather myself to my feet. The intruder begins to appear to change in mass, but I’m not exactly sure what I’m watching. He cries again as he vomits on the floor. 

He howls, as if he’s never experienced pain like this. Hell, I’ve never experienced whatever is going on. 

He vomits again, spewing food remains and white foam on the kitchen floor. He jerks his head upward. He looks in my general direction, but doesn’t make eye contact with me. His crystal blue eyes begin to weep and his skin blushes and swells around them. He strains his neck, revealing massive veins. 

He cries out again, this time it sounds more like a man. He looks downward, then back up and finally our eyes meet. He’s fucking pissed.

I’m so confined in his invidious gaze, I barely notice his teeth have grown. They’re massive now, actually. Canines point out from his lips and weave through other jagged teeth that now fill his mouth. “What the fuck is happening?” I whisper. 

He hastily pans the room. I try to track where his eyes go but I’m unsure what he’s looking for. His leather outfit tightens around him and begins to pull away at its seams. His skin darkens and fine hairs sprout from his face. He faces me again, this time the side of his jaw pointed towards the ceiling, like how foxes do when they’re curious. 

All at once, as if he finally gave in, his body accelerates into a huge stature. His nails lunge from his fingertips and peel the flooring underneath. His jacket bursts open on his back, and although it faces away from me, I can see long dark hairs spread down his spine. His face pushes forward and he smacks his jaw together as he coughs. His nose stays in place against his face as his cheekbones rise forward. 

He stands up. 

As he rises the butcher’s knife falls from behind him and clatters on the floor. The steak knife still protrudes from his back, hanging on like a loose tooth. He snarls at me, his monstrous teeth move around another set behind them. As if the razor sharp canines were curtains for his human molars. 

I feel myself start to pass out. This has gotten terrifyingly out of hand. 

Like a hail mary throw, my brain sparks its magic once more; I remember what I was doing just before showering. I look to my right and on the coffee table is my laptop. It was gifted to me at my first college, it's a cheap Lenovo, it can totally go. 

Without any hesitation I move towards the table and seize it. I startle the beast, and he moves forward, but halts himself when he comprehends what's in my hand. He’s so much larger than he was seconds ago.

Our eyes meet. I have no idea what this thing in my living room is anymore and I’m praying this gets it out of my sight. I sprint towards the sliding glass door behind me. It leads me out to a wooden deck and I launch the laptop into the parking lot below. Just as soon as it leaves my hand, the hulking figure bursts through the opening and snags the device before it meets the ground. 

His feet slam onto the concrete. Without missing a step he speeds off to the forest in front of him on all fours, carrying the laptop in his mouth (mouths?). His nails click-clack against the pavement until he disappears behind the trees. His body is as dark as the shadows he’s now surrounded by. 

I look downward to find my downstairs neighbor, Cortland, staring at the woods and then back up at me. “You really need to find some nicer girls, champ.”",1,1766725551.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

And a promise that this is only the beginning. Thanks for your support.,"“Mama, have you seen my lip gloss?” Maisey popped her head into the den, auburn hair disheveled from a much too rough towel drying, “I’m going out with Nadia tonight, and I wanna look snatched.” She snapped her fingers and lilted her shoulder with a cheeky grin.

Petra looked up from her tome, eyebrow raised, “Snatched? Sha, you already look like someone snatched you up by the scruff. Lip gloss will only sully the aesthetic.”

Maisey groaned, “Mama!”

Petra chuckled, looking back down at her book, “Is it the one you used to wear when you went to visit the Woods girl?”

“Paige, Mama…” Maisey went still.

“Was that her name?”

“Mama…”

Petra glanced at her middle child over her spectacles, “Sorry, my baby. I still don’t like the way she treated you… There’s that box of stuff you took from her house after…”

Maisey winced. She hadn’t forgotten the fight they’d gotten into when Paige broke up with her, but she couldn’t remember what she’d thrown into that box.

Petra’s eyes were fixed on her daughter. She closed the book. 

“Do you want me to take a look?” she asked softly. 

Maisey scoffed, “It’s been three years. I’m over it.”

Petra watched silently as Maisey’s claws dug into the wooden frame of the archway to the Den.

“Mhm,” she hummed, “It’s in the attic.”

Maisey turned on her heel without a word. 

Petra reopened her tome and scanned the page with her fingertip until she found her place.

“Very convincing, child of mine.”

Maisey walked on her toes to the ladder that led up to the attic and tightened her towel around her chest. 

“Fuckin’ Paige,” she said under her breath, and mockingly, “You’re too young. You think everything is so deep. You’re too serious about me… Such an asshole!”

She climbed the ladder like it had just called her dumb. Glancing around the attic, she spotted the box conveniently placed right beside Gigi’s old chair. 

Appropriate. Memories of people who left, stacked in one tidy pile. Maisey plopped down in the chair and glared into the box, her arms folded in her lap. 

“It’s been three years,” she whispered to herself, “it’s my own damn stuff…” 

She chewed on a nail bed, staring at the cardboard container like it were full of dangerous things. To be fair, that lip gloss was seriously dangerous on Maisey. 

The thought was all the courage she needed, she reached into the box and started rifling through its contents. 

A hoodie adorned with rips and holes from early transformations- Paige had said it smelled like Maisey and her Wolf at the same time and made sleeping alone more cozy. 

A toothbrush that had taken residence because Maisey slept in Paige’s arms more times than she slept in her own bed during high school.

A tattered, stuffed wolf that Maisey had stitched by hand- a gift for Paige she hadn’t grabbed, but which had been unceremoniously shoved into the box by Paige on her way out the door.

Under a bra with a broken latch, a corsage from their last prom together, and a few trinkets from memorable dates, she finally found the lip gloss. It was stuck to a folded bit of paper. One word was written on the outer fold.

“Daisy”

“Fuck me…” Maisey breathed.

She peeled the note off the lip gloss and slipped the tube into the top of her towel. The world bent around her for the absolute eternity she spent sitting there, staring at that origami dagger.

Shoulders curling inward, breath shallow, head spinning, pulse racing. 

Maisey knew Paige had a crush on Daisy before she’d started dating her. But that was when Paige was 15. This handwriting looked like it was penned by a significantly older Paige… the one who’d broken up with Maisey for being “too young” and “emotionally complicated”. 

“Don’t open it,” she whispered to the dust. But her hands betrayed her and unfolded the page anyway. 



Daisy,

I know you don’t want to hear this. And I won’t make you, I promise I’ll never send it to you. I just need to say it, like… to you, because it’s been this knot in my throat for so long and I can’t breathe around it anymore. And I know you’d punch me right in the face for saying it without saying this part first. 
I do love Maisey. I do. Goddess knows I don’t deserve that girl, and I know it too. 
No one has ever, will ever love me like she does. She’s fuckin’ perfect. 
But even so, there hasn’t been one day that went by that I didn’t think of you. Every time she kisses me, I close my eyes and… I know it makes me a monster, I know! But I close my eyes and think of you. I’ve been in love with you since the moment I saw you and I haven’t stopped dreaming of you since. 
I know you are choosing that Nightborn witch, and I know you think there’s no Lunar Bond in the world waiting for you, that you’re some kind of exception to the rules… but I wish you’d give me just one chance to test it… because I think you’re the One. 
My Lunar Bond, not my Wolf’s, I can tell that belongs to Maisey. But I am yours… and I am still  waiting for you. I’ll wait forever.
And… that’s why I have to break up with your sister. It isn’t fair to her… or to me… that you’re who I can’t stop thinking about when I’m with her. I can’t tell her this either, I think it would kill her… or she’d kill me.
That’s it. That’s what I needed to say. I wish I actually had the courage to say it to you for real, but this will have to do. 

As long as the moon hangs in the sky,
Yours.

Paige Woods



Petra sat with one knee pulled to her chest, foot in the chair, book propped on her outstretched leg. She was jotting a note in the margin when a loud thud shook the ceiling and rattled the chandelier over the coffee table. 

Muffled by the attic floor, Maisey’s voice tore through the air. Wordless, unbridled rage. Then shattering glass and a wooden crash on the lawn. 

“Petra?!” Isabel’s voice echoed down the hall, followed by hurried footsteps. Rounding the corner so fast she slid to a stop, Isabel burst into the room braced for crisis- one hand on her chest to steady her own heart, the other already reaching for Petra. Eyes wide, jaw clenched. Petra stood up and took Isabel’s hand.

“It’s alright, Love. It’s just Maisey… going through her things from the breakup.”

“Break up? I didn’t even know she was in a relationship!” 

Above, the cacophonous clattering of a table of miscellaneous things being cleared onto the floor. Isabel flinched.

“The breakup with Paige.”

“That was years ago, are you sure?”

The sound of upholstery tearing, sturdy built furniture slamming into a wall and splintering.

“There’s no amount of time that softens the blow of being left by your Moon-mate. Her Wolf will always ache for that love… And knowing Maisey, she’s as invested as her Beast.”

“Should we check on her?”

A cascade of glass shattered- like a china cabinet thrown on its side.

“That sounded expensive,” Isabel said.

“It sounded like mine,” Petra closed the book, set it on the table, and gently squeezed Isabel’s hand, “be right back, darlin’.”

But before she’d crossed the rug, Maisey stepped into the hall by the entry to the den- towel forgotten, lip gloss clenched in her clawed fist, every muscle rippling like she was resisting a transformation. 

Isabel’s eyes darted to the ceiling. Petra held Maisey’s gaze. 

She stalked into the room, placed a folded square of paper on the tome, kissed her mother’s cheek, then turned and headed down the hall to her childhood bedroom.

“Hi, Isabel… Sorry for the mess, I’ll clean up tomorrow,” Maisey said it like all she’d done was spill a bit of flour in the kitchen… not as though she’d just upended a trove of ancient relics carrying the memories of a hundred Loomis Queens.

Isabel stared at Petra like a deer in headlights, “Will she be staying with us for her whole winter break?“",4,1766725498.0,u_IndigoChagrin,0,1.0,False

The beginning of December I get an anxious feeling of dread as I know my mom is going to gift us a lot of clothing. She is a clothing shopaholic and spends an absurd amount of money on clothing. We had one year the biggest box you’d ever seen and i kid you not it was a big box of just socks ranging from the 3 pair to 6 pairs. Husband and I got like 8-10 packs of these. We also get a lot of shirts, pants, jackets, mittens you name it. She stopped asking for lists of things we actually want (usually body kits, cologne, practical items we actually would use) and usually it’s just clothes with maybe a candle, survival thing or a random thing she finds off the internet. We do use some of the clothing but a majority of the clothing is the kind that I find isn’t comfortable or gives me rashes or just something we honestly wouldn’t even wear. We donate a lot of clothing to a church that houses the poor and the people absolutely love getting the clothing the last couple years and do wear every single clothing and food we donate. But I still get that PTSD everytime I get these gifts. We have tried asking for gift cards but my mom says no because it would just go to “wasteful” things (despite us giving her store ideas like Maurice’s, kohls or macys for clothing and other stores like Home Depot, At-Home, Hobby Lobby, Walmart or Target. Even restaurants we go to like Applebee’s, Texas Roadhouse or coffee places) 

Our dad’s solution is just to donate and that’s what we’ve done for years now. I like to donate to the poor since they really need it and I’ll still contuine to donate to our church and community but it’s just the losing battle of just knowing your getting the stuff that you know would go to others that would actaully use it rather than getting it because it was gifted by family.

1pvw33q,https://i.redd.it/xj2on2rjdh9g1.jpeg,The Humble Houseplant That Holds the Secret to Immortality,"
In the dim corners of our homes, amid  forgotten shelves and coffee tables, thrives a quiet revolution in green: the Syngonium ‘Berry Allusion’. This unassuming arrowhead plant, with leaves that blush like a summer watermelon—creamy light green centers veined in hot pink, edged in deeper olive—has conquered living rooms worldwide. But its true magic isn’t just its alien-like beauty. It’s a survivor, encoded with ancient instructions that allow it to thrive in conditions far from its rainforest origins. And in its resilience lies a profound lesson about life itself—one that points toward a future where death becomes optional.

Native to the shady, dappled understories of Central and South American rainforests, Syngonium podophyllum evolved in a world of filtered sunlight and constant humidity. Yet today, it’s one of the most popular houseplants on the planet. Why? Because its thick-enough, leathery leaves can withstand neglect that would kill more delicate tropicals. Let the soil dry out completely? No problem—the leaves might droop dramatically, but a good soak (many enthusiasts swear by bottom-watering) brings them bouncing back. Low light? It tolerates it better than most, though brighter indirect light intensifies those stunning pink veins.
This adaptability isn’t luck. It’s written in its DNA.

The Blueprint of Life: From Atoms to Arrowheads

At the heart of every living thing—from this pink-veined vine to you reading these words—is DNA: a twisted ladder of instructions built from the simplest building blocks of the universe.

It starts with atoms—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen etc.—clustering into molecules, chaining into amino acids, folding into proteins. Those proteins assemble cells, tissues, organs, and entire organisms. For the Syngonium, its DNA dictates arrow-shaped juvenile leaves that mature into lobed forms, watercolor-like pigmentation that screams “look at me,” and a forgiving nature that lets it endure dry apartments and forgotten waterings.

But DNA isn’t rigid. It’s responsive. Place your Syngonium in a dark corner, and it stretches—becoming “leggy,” with long, bare stems reaching desperately for light. The once-vibrant colors fade, leaves sparse. It looks sickly, almost defeated.

Yet move it to brighter light, prune it back, and watch the miracle: new growth erupts bushy and brilliant, pinks popping like never before. The instructions for beauty were always there, merely paused under stress. This is nature versus nurture in action—the environment shaping expression, but the core DNA code remaining intact. 

Its Full Glory
Want your own slice of this resilient wonder? Here’s how to make it thrive:

	•	Light: Bright, indirect—east or west window ideal. Tolerates low light but colors shine in medium-bright.

	•	Water: Let soil dry out between waterings. Drooping leaves are its thirst signal; they’ll perk up fast after drinking.

	•	Humidity: Loves it high (rainforest roots!), but adapts to average home levels. Mist occasionally.

	•	Soil: Well-draining aroid mix.

	•	Temperature: 65–85°F—keep away from cold drafts.

	•	Bonus: It’s an air purifier, climbing vine (provide a moss pole for drama), and super easy to propagate from cuttings.

Toxic to pets if ingested, so place high if you have curious cats or dogs.

From Houseplant to Human Destiny

This little plant’s story mirrors our own. We too carry DNA instructions for health, longevity, adaptation. Stress—poor diet, environment, age—can make us “leggy,” dimming our vitality. 
But the blueprint for renewal persists in our DNA.

Now imagine the future: Artificial intelligence mastering DNA like a book, editing “letters” for optimal health. Erasing genetic flaws, bolstering repair mechanisms, extending life indefinitely. Diseases of aging? Obsolete. Death? A relic of the past, like tales from “before modern medicine.”

After we had our son 4 years ago (we have no village btw, this will be important as it factors into our constant need for me/us time and persistent burnout from both our jobs), both our personal hygiene took a hit but in the last year I’ve been working really hard on being consistent with showers and tooth brushing and all the basic things, because I want to ensure that not only do I look and feel presentable, but I’m also setting a good example with our son. We both are very present parents and we play with him all day, so by the time he goes to bed we both just want to crash and just hang out watching a movie or talk. 

Well, recently, my husband took a shower during the day and our son asked “why is your hair wet daddy?” So husband said “I took a shower!” To which our son replied “but you don’t shower daddy, only mommy does!” He laughed it off, and I was hoping that would helo motivate him, but nope. He prob takes a shower every 2 weeks. 

His car is a mess, full of garbage from the week’s coffee and on the go breakfasts, and cigarette butts and ash and spilled shit. He borrowed my car for a week and it was the same by the end. BTW we walk to school, so our son rarely gets in our cars

His electric toothbrush base is super nasty, to the point where our son asked me to teach him how to keep his clean “like yours so it doesn’t get gross like daddy’s.” 

At home, he’ll do dishes like a normal person should and makes sure our son is well taken care of in every way, he is an active part of caring for our pets, he is the one who handles the garbage bins and compost, we split the litter and dog shit. 

We haven’t had sex in a few weeks, due to a myriad of reasons, but whenever we do, he always makes sure he’s clean and his privates have always been exceptionally clean, so no complaints there, in case that was gonna be a question. 

Both my husband and I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, I’m treated and (like I mentioned) go to therapy. He smokes weed at night as his own antidepressant and anxiety meds, but does not go to therapy. I love him, and other than these issues, he’s a very present daddy and husband. I love him and I want to bring this up but in a tactful and compassionate way so he knows it is coming from a place of love and concern, rather than critique, especially now that our son is starting to pick up on his poor hygiene. How can I approach this? Anybody else dealt with something similar? TIA ",2,1766724878.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

Hi everyone 👋
I’m new to Riyadh and still getting to know the city. I don’t have many friends here yet, so I thought I’d post and see if anyone is interested in hanging out or just chatting.

I’m open to meeting people for coffee, walks, exploring the city, gym, or any chill activities. If you’re also new here (or even if you’re not), feel free to comment or DM me.

Looking forward to meeting some cool people 🙂

For context: my relationship with MIL has been challenging. She centered her life around being a mom and is struggling with both her kids getting married. I find her insecure, jealous, needy, passive aggressive and codependent. 

Latest issue: I gave my husband a daily pun calendar last year for Christmas and he loved it. It’s a whole thing with us that we get excited to see the pun of the day as we drink our morning coffee together. He told his mom and sister over the summer how much he loved this calendar I got him.

So for Christmas this year, his mom bought him a daily “witty phrase” calendar. At first I was giving her the benefit of the doubt but she immediately turned to me and goes “did you also get him a daily calendar”. I smile and nod and then she goes on to say “well mines different cause yours are puns. Did you get him that calendar” which I replied “he hasn’t opened it yet so I’d prefer to not say the specific calendar” (I got him a daily facts calendar for this year to switch it up)  

It really rubbed me the wrong way cause she’s copying me and this daily calendar was “our thing” and feels like she’s trying to interject herself. 

Husband said her calendar sucks and we won’t be using it haha. We also agreed that we will no longer be sharing gifts we give each other that bring us joy in fear of her competing. 

Im frustrated in her insecurities and already have a low contact relationship from her. Am I overreacting or is she low key competing with me? ",11,1766724736.0,motherinlawsfromhell,3,1.0,False

The chemical component of addiction often leaves the body in a matter of days, but the **Subconscious Associations** last for years. This is why a ""recovering"" smoker can feel a massive craving just by smelling coffee or finishing a meal.

Hypnotherapy targets these specific ""neural associations."" We use the hypnotic state to ""de-couple"" the trigger (e.g., stress) from the response (e.g., a drink). We then install new, healthier ""Shortcuts"" for the brain to get the same reward (relaxation or dopamine) without the harmful substance. You aren't ""giving something up""—you are reclaiming your agency.

**TL;DR:** Addiction is 90% mental association. Hypnosis breaks the links between your triggers and your habits, making ""quitting"" feel like ""freedom.""

problem is if i quit soda i pretty much have to be water only unless i soak cucumber in water or something, but to me that is more trouble than it's worth and i may as well just be water only...

1pvvkl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1pvvkl0/struggling_to_deal_with_inconsiderate_roommates/,Struggling to deal with inconsiderate roommates,"I have been in a toxic living situation for the past year. I (24F) moved in with two other girls who were in the same grad school program as me (22F and 23F.) They got very close to each other very fast and didn’t make any effort to include me and are now best friends. I talked to them multiple times about how I would like to be included and asked if I had done anything wrong, and they always said no not at all, and things would get slightly better for a couple of days, but then go back to how they were. 

It felt to me like things went very downhill after about 3 months. They both are servers and get back very late, like around 1-2 AM, and are loud and disruptive when they get home, and it affects my sleep. One of them always takes a shower and plays music when the bathroom is right across from my bedroom. The other one has a boyfriend who basically lives with us 24/7 now. We also have very different expectations for cleanliness. I do a significant amount of cleaning around the apartment and they never do any, and don’t want to do a chore chart because they don’t think it’s necessary. One of them specifically leaves her dishes in the sink and drying rack for days. I’ve talked to her multiple times about it and have asked that she please do it within 24 hours, and she acts as if I’m so unreasonable and ridiculous for expecting that. She also leaves dirty coffee mugs and trash laying around the apartment for days as well. She has a lot of clutter on all of our tables, but says she “has made the apartment a home.” Honestly, it feels like her home and I’m just living in it. She says my expectations for her are too high, I’m judgmental, and I’m just jealous I’m not close with her and my other roommate. 

The same girl has two kitties. She does not take care of them, is routinely gone 8-10 hours a day, and spends many nights at guys houses. She scoops their litter once a week and leaves the cat poop in our kitchen trash. They are a year old and have not been spayed and have been in heat for the last five months. They are incredibly loud and disruptive when in heat. She has put off getting them spayed repeatedly, and I put my foot down in November after she didn’t take them to the appointment she had made for them to get spayed and insisted she take them home with her for Thanksgiving (my roommates have left the cats with me multiple times for days or a week without asking if I’m going to be there). She relented, but my roommates have started talking shit about me about how “unreasonable” I am and how they hate living with me, among various other things, and I overheard them the other day. I have initiated conversations with them several times about the things above, and I have always been mature and respectful when doing so, but they have consistently gotten defensive. Both of my roommates seem very irresponsible and inconsiderate to me, and I’ve felt that for awhile, but this now feels like mean girl middle school shit. They both do gossip about other people a lot, and I’ve commented on that and said it made me feel uncomfortable, and they said that that’s just because they’re each other’s best friend. 

I’ve found someone to take over my lease because the apartment feels very hostile to me. I texted in our groupchat and said I was going to sublease and my one roommate said she “definitely thinks it’s for the best I’m leaving” because I make her anxious because she feels like I’m always unhappy with her, which I don’t think is fair. She also said she has a lot of animosity and resentment towards me because my expectations are too high. I have made it clear I don’t expect perfection. I’ve just asked her to clean up after herself and her cats (and maybe actually do some communal cleaning for once as well) but apparently it’s too much for her. Her cats have also started peeing on our furniture a lot and she doesn’t clean it despite it smelling strongly like cat pee, and she’s gotten very upset when I’ve kindly asked her to clean the furniture when she had the time. At this point, neither of my roommates speak to me and I don’t speak to them, but they have continued to talk shit about me behind my back. Our apartment doesn’t know we have the cats and I’m considering telling them when I move out, but I don’t want the cats to be harmed. I’m just at my wits end with this situation. Am I in the wrong?

1pvvfgr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvvfgr,I would love some thoughts and suggestions on these (basic) renderings,"I am trying to decide how to arrange the living room area and used planner 5d to come up with this. The furniture, room sizes and dimensions are all accurate. the color choices are def not. This is an open floor plan with the sofas facing the tv. The three seater sofa is in front of the island&kitchen. The foyer leads into the living room where the 2 seater sofa is. The larger sofa is 120 inches in width and the smaller one is 84 inches. It's 3 people in the house and when we do entertain it is usually 8-10 adults about once a month. The only slight concern is there isn't enough seating for all 10 adults.

1. The bistro table is for breakfast, morning coffee and a place for my daughter to eat in her high chair.
2. The other side has a sliding glass door which opens to the outdoor patio.
3. The tv wall will have built ins on both sides.
4. We are considering recliner sofas because I love them and love to put my legs up when watching tv.
5. We are considering getting floor pillows or additional ottomans.

1pvvdia,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pvvdia/four_months_in_benefits_decaying/,Four months in - benefits decaying,"I quit coffee 4 months ago today. 

The first couple of months were wonderful - the effects of stopping coffee completely were very noticable, with an amazing sense of calm throughout the day. 

  
The other day though I suddenly realized that I no longer consciously feel the benefits. This state just became my new normal. 

I realize that I must still be living much calmer, but the change is no longer noticable. 

  
I am still much calmer and my anxiety levels are much lower than before, especially in stressful days and social interactions. But I am no longer \_aware\_ of that. 

  
This is both a bit saddening and comforting. ",5,1766723017.0,decaf,3,1.0,False
1pvvd6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pvvd6c/bolivia_vs_colombia_after_peru_salkantay_trek/,Bolivia vs Colombia after Peru Salkantay trek,"Hi all,

I’m planning a 3.5 week honeymoon in South America (Sept–Oct) and would love some perspective from people who’ve done either or both options.

The Peru part of the trip is pretty much locked in:

* Lima (2 nights)
* Arequipa (3 nights, acclimating)
* Cusco + Sacred Valley (4 nights)
* 5-day Salkantay trek to Machu Picchu
* Night back in Cusco after the trek

After that, I’m deciding between **two very different second halves** and struggling to weigh uniqueness vs comfort and flow.

**Option A: Bolivia**

* Lake Titicaca
* La Paz
* Death Road
* 3-day Uyuni salt flats tour

This would obviously be higher altitude, colder, more rugged, but includes some once-in-a-lifetime landscapes, especially Uyuni.

**Option B: Colombia**

* Fly Cusco to Medellín
* Medellín (culture, food, day trips like Guatapé)
* Salento / Coffee Region (Cocora Valley, coffee farms, slower pace)

This feels warmer, more flexible, better food, and potentially more “honeymoon-friendly”, but maybe less singular than Uyuni.

We are from Australia and this is our first time in South America and will likely not get back to South America for many years. I like the idea of doing Bolivia now and doing a proper Colombia trip in the future but that could be a long way away. We’re experienced travellers and fine with adventure, though we have never done a multi-day trek. We value history, scenery, food and contemporary culture. This is a honeymoon, and it comes straight after a demanding multi-day trek, so recovery, enjoyment, and overall vibe matter as much as bucket-list value.

For people who’ve done:

* Uyuni and the Bolivia circuit, or
* Medellín + Salento, or
* Both

Which did you find more rewarding? Any regrets skipping one for the other?  
or do you have another suggestion?

Thank you in advance",2,1766722987.0,travel,6,0.76,False
