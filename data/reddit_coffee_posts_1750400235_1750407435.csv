I started my own coffee business about two years ago when I was 14. Since then, I’ve been bootstrapping it and saving carefully to grow the business. My family and girlfriend have been a big help along the way. Between everything I’ve invested — from equipment to a company truck — the business has around \$27,000 to \$34,000 in assets, if you consider current market values. I find it interesting because I source a lot of things at good prices by searching everywhere.

That said, I’m about to get my driver’s license, and this summer I’m planning to work in construction to gain new skills and experience. While construction is quite different from running a coffee business, I think the hands-on experience and learning the trade will be valuable for me as I continue to grow professionally.

I’m wondering if having a business like this, plus plans to work in construction and eventually pursue a degree, makes for a solid foundation when applying for jobs in business management or marketing. Sometimes I question if my business is substantial enough to be a strong talking point on applications, but when I look at the investment and progress, it’s more than I initially thought—

1lfyhfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1lfyhfh/i_was_sleeping_one_day_and_felt_like_i_could_feel/,I was sleeping one day and felt like I could feel the earth spinning.,"It was such a weird experience.

I normally smoke weed but ever since I came to my parents house and live together, I have not been using any substance other than cigarettes and coffee.

I tend to sleep late and just cant calm my mind so I often try to just close my eyes and meditate, feeling all my muscles and nerves, tracing any pains and discomfort until I feel relaxed and fall sleep.

But there was something different about this one particular night.

Im trying to remember when but I know for the fact what I felt was something beyond my human body could perceive in normal state.

I was indeed, felt the planet earth spinning and I could feel the weight of my world gliding in empty space.

It was not just my head spinning where I got confused on the sensation of earth spinning,

My legs, arms, belly and even my hairs could feel the motion of the planet.

Like you know how if you are in the moving car or train, you are in the motion with the vehicle so it seems you are still but in fact you move right?

You feel the inertia shifting at the start or stopping of vehicle but when its in continuous smooth speed, you feel stabilized.

Now imagine somehow my body was not receiving the inertia of the planet because my mind was held non physically at the moment.

I almost threw up and my body was very weak, like I hardly felt my legs and arms until I massaged them furiously to feel my body again.

It was crazy the fact that it just happened on my sober state and something I have never able to feel again no matter how much I tried again.

What do you think? Maybe my soul somehow got detached and was going against the planets movement or something?

Cuz it felt like I was bit spinning faster and faster to get seperated almost.

And I was very vividly, conscious.

Something huge.

Instead, she sat across from me at our tiny kitchen table, her perfectly manicured nails tapping against the rim of her coffee cup, and casually announced she was getting married.

Married.

To Victor Castillo.

For a second, I just stared at her, my brain refusing to process what she had just said. Victor Castillo. Victor Castillo. As in, the man who had made my life miserable with his smug little smirks, backhanded compliments, and condescending attitude. The man who always looked at me like I was something stuck to the bottom of his stupid designer shoes.

I swallowed hard, trying to push down the rage bubbling up inside me. My mother tilted her head, her lips curving into a small, expectant smile, like she was waiting for me to leap up and hug her or something. Yeah, right.

“Well?” she finally said, her voice sharp, like a knife slicing through the tension. “Aren’t you going to say anything?”

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in myears. My fingers curled around the edge of the table, gripping it like it was the only thing keeping me from snapping.

Victor Castillo. The name alone made my skin crawl. How could she even think this was okay? How could she look at me with a straight face and expect me to be happy about this?

Across the table, Cassandra let out an excited squeal, practically vibrating in her seat. Her blonde curls bounced as she clapped her hands together.

“Oh my God, Mom! That’s amazing! Congratulations!” she gushed, her blue eyes sparkling with excitement.

I flinched. Of course she was thrilled.

My mother reached across the table to squeeze Cassandra’s hand, her expression softening in a way it never did when she looked at me. “Thank you, darling. I knew you’d be happy for me.”

I suddenly felt like I couldn’t breathe. Like the air had been sucked out of the room.

“I should go,” I mumbled, pushing my chair back. The sound of the legs scraping against the tile made my teeth clench, but I didn’t care. I needed to get out.

My mother barely spared me a glance. “Of course, you’re always so busy,” she said dismissively, waving a hand like my presence—or lack of it—didn’t matter.

I didn’t look back as I grabbed my bag and headed for the door.

\---

The walk back to my apartment felt longer than usual, the cold air stinging my cheeks as I replayed the conversation over and over in my head.

Victor Castillo.

It didn’t make sense. My mom was beautiful, successful, and could have literally anyone—so why him? Why the one man who had made my life miserable in the most subtle, infuriating ways? He never said anything outright cruel, but his words always had this edge, like a knife coated in sugar.

“Are you sure you want to wear that, Aria?”

“You’re so… different from your sister.”

“Maybe if you smiled more, people wouldn’t find you so intimidating.”

I gritted my teeth, my nails digging into my palms. He was fake, manipulative, and worst of all? My mom never noticed. Or maybe she did and just didn’t care.

By the time I got to my apartment, I felt like I had been hit by a truck. I tossed my bag onto the couch, kicked off my shoes, and flopped onto my bed, staring at the cracked ceiling.

Silence.

It was comforting and suffocating all at once.

My phone buzzed. I grabbed it off the nightstand, my heart stupidly hopeful for a second, but of course, it was my mother.

I let it ring once. Twice. Three times.

Then I answered.

“Aria,” she said, her voice sharp and impatient. “I don’t understand why you couldn’t be more supportive earlier. This is a big moment for me. Can’t you at least pretend to be happy for once?”

I clenched my jaw so hard it hurt. “I’ll send you a gift,” I said flatly, forcing my voice to stay even.

She sighed dramatically, like I was the biggest disappointment in the world. “You’ve always been so cold,” she muttered. “I don’t know why you can’t be more like Cassandra. She was thrilled, you know. You could learn a thing or two from her.”

There it was. The comparison. The same one I’d been hearing my entire life.

Why can’t you be more like Cassandra?

Why can’t you just be happy for me?

Why can’t you just smile?

I swallowed hard, my throat burning. “Goodnight, Mom.”

I hung up before she could say anything else.

For a second, I just sat there, gripping my phone so tightly my knuckles turned white. Then, without warning, the tears came. Hot, angry, stupid tears. I wiped them away furiously, cursing myself for letting her get to me again.

She didn’t deserve my tears. None of them did.

I turned onto my side, my gaze landing on the only framed photo on my nightstand. My father.

A quiet man with kind eyes. The only person who had ever made me feel like I was enough.

He would have hated Victor Castillo.

My phone buzzed again. I groaned, expecting another lecture from my mom, but it wasn’t her.

It was Cassandra.

Hey, Aria! Come dress shopping with me tomorrow? It’ll be fun!

I stared at the message, my fingers hovering over the keyboard. Spending a whole day with Cassandra sounded like a nightmare, but saying no would only make things worse.

With a resigned sigh, I typed back: Okay, sure.

As I set the phone down, I let out a long, exhausted breath.

Tomorrow was going to suck.

The boutique was huge. Like, the kind of fancy place you only saw in those wedding reality shows where brides freaked out over dresses and had dramatic breakdowns because their moms didn’t like the one they picked. It smelled like flowers and expensive perfume, and the lighting was all soft and golden, making everything look like it belonged in a fairy tale.

I, however, felt like a total outsider.

While other girls twirled in front of massive mirrors, looking all giddy and in love with their wedding dresses, I stood near the entrance, arms crossed tightly over my chest. My black blouse and jeans felt completely out of place in a sea of white lace and silk. I hated being around people. I hated weddings. And most of all, I hated that I had to be here, pretending like I cared about any of this.

“Aria! Come help me pick one!”

Cassandra’s voice rang through the boutique like a bell, sweet and excited. I turned and saw her standing on one of those little podiums, spinning in a light blue gown that swished around her like water. She looked like a princess, of course. She always did.

Our mom stood beside her, practically glowing with pride. “Oh, Cassandra, you look breathtaking,” she gushed, her hands clasped together. “Absolutely radiant. Just like a princess.”

I bit my lip, already bracing myself for what was coming.

Cassandra turned to me, eyes shining. “Well? What do you think?”

I forced a polite smile. “You look beautiful, Cass.”

And I meant it. She did look beautiful. With her golden hair and perfect honey-colored eyes, she was made for moments like this. Meanwhile, I was just the extra in the background, the shadow no one ever really noticed.

“You could at least sound like you mean it,” our mother muttered, just loud enough for me to hear.

My hands clenched into fists, but I kept my mouth shut. There was no point in arguing. Not today.

I wandered away, letting my fingers trail along the lace of a nearby dress. The material was soft under my touch, delicate and intricate. I wished I could just disappear into the fabric, vanish from this whole situation.

Then, the bell over the door chimed.

And I felt my stomach drop.

It's like I knew what was coming before I even turned around.

Victor Castillo had arrived.

He strolled in like he owned the entire store, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor. He had that same smug smirk on his face, like he was the most important person in the room. My hands curled tighter. I hated that smirk. I hated everything about him.

“Ladies,” he greeted, walking straight over to our mother and Cassandra. “I just had to come see how my beautiful stepdaughter was doing.”

Stepdaughter.

I wanted to gag.

Our mother, of course, practically melted at his words. “Victor, how sweet of you to check on us.”

His eyes flicked to me, and I felt my entire body stiffen. There was something dark in his gaze, something that made my skin crawl. He knew exactly what he was doing.

“You’re awfully quiet today, Aria,” he murmured, just loud enough for me to hear. “Not excited about the wedding?”

I swallowed hard, forcing my face to stay neutral. “I just don’t like shopping.”

Victor’s smirk widened. He stepped closer, his hand brushing against my arm—just a light touch, barely even there, but it was enough to send a shiver down my spine.

“Shame,” he mused. “A pretty girl like you should enjoy getting dressed up.”

I yanked my arm away like his touch had burned me. My heart pounded in my ears, my skin prickling with unease.

Victor just chuckled. Then, as if nothing had happened, he turned back to Cassandra, who was still spinning in front of the mirror, completely oblivious.

I needed to get out of here.

“I’m going to get some air,” I muttered, not waiting for a response before walking straight out the door.

The cold air hit me like a wave, and I sucked in a deep breath, trying to steady my racing pulse. The street was busy, cars rushing by, people chatting, laughing, going about their normal lives. I wished I could be one of them.

Then—BAM.

I walked straight into something solid.

Or, more accurately, someone.

A pair of strong hands grabbed my arms before I could stumble back. My breath caught in my throat.

He was… tall. Like, ridiculously tall. At least 6’4”, with broad shoulders and a suit that looked like it was made just for him. His black hair was slightly messy, like he had just run his fingers through it, but somehow, it still looked perfect. But it was his eyes that stopped me in my tracks.

Deep, piercing blue. The kind of blue that felt like it could see right through you. There was something playful in them, like he was amused by something I didn’t know about.

His lips curved into a lazy, crooked smile. “You okay there, princess?”

Princess?

Heat rushed to my face. I tried to say something, but my brain had completely shut down. All I could do was stare.

He let out a low chuckle, the sound sending a weird, tingling sensation down my spine. Then he leaned in just slightly, his breath warm against my skin.

“You gonna keep staring,” he murmured, “or should I be flattered?”

My stomach flipped.

I snapped my mouth shut, stepping back so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. His smirk deepened, his eyes glinting like he was enjoying this way too much.

He cleared his throat. “Well, as fun as this is, I should probably introduce myself.”

I blinked. Right. Normal people introduced themselves.

“I—uh—” I struggled to find words, my face still burning.

His smirk widened. “Matteo,” he said smoothly. “And you are?”

I hesitated. Something about him felt… different. Like he was the kind of person who could flip my world upside down without even trying.

“…Aria,” I finally mumbled.

Matteo’s eyes darkened slightly, his smirk turning into something unreadable. He looked at me like he recognized my name.

Before I could ask why, the boutique door swung open behind me.

When I looked back at Matteo, his expression had shifted. The amusement was still there, but now there was something else in his eyes. Curiosity. Interest.

Like he had just found something—someone—worth paying attention to.

A low chuckle rumbled from his chest, smooth as silk.

My stomach flipped. I snapped my mouth shut and quickly took a step back.

He smirked, then cleared his throat, the sound snapping me out of my trance

I blinked, reality crashing back in all at once once i heard Victor’s scratchy voice. My heart was still racing, my skin still tingling where his fingers had touched me

Who the hell was this man?

And why did he make it feel like the ground had just shifted beneath my feet?

The moment she crashed into me, I knew my day had just gotten interesting.

I barely had time to react before she staggered back, her wide eyes locking onto mine like a deer caught in headlights. For a few seconds, she just stood there, her mouth slightly parted, completely mesmerized. And damn, if I wasn’t entertained by it.

I took my time studying her, letting my gaze drift over the delicate features, the way her dark hair cascaded over her shoulders, and the faint flush creeping up her neck. She was cute in a way she probably didn’t even realize—completely unaware of the effect she had when she looked at someone like that.

I smirked, leaning in just slightly. “You okay there, princess?”

She blinked, as if snapping out of some spell, and quickly stepped back. Her cheeks were red, but she tried to play it off, crossing her arms over her chest.

I chuckled, low and deep. “You gonna keep staring, or should I be flattered?”

She scowled, but before she could come up with some sort of snappy response, the boutique doors swung open.

I didn’t even have to turn around to know who it was. The moment I heard that fake, overly friendly voice, my good mood soured.

“Matteo! What a pleasant surprise.”

Victor.

I finally looked away from the girl—Aria, I was guessing—and turned my attention to the man I despised. He strolled toward us with that slimy grin, his hands stuffed casually into the pockets of his expensive slacks. Everything about him reeked of pretense, from the perfectly styled hair to the way he always tried too hard to seem important.

I didn’t bother masking my reaction. My smirk dropped, and instead, I let my expression turn cold, my distaste evident.

Victor hesitated for a split second before clearing his throat. “I was actually just talking about you earlier.”

“Lucky me,” I drawled.

He chuckled awkwardly, pretending not to notice the tension. “Still as charming as ever, I see.”

I didn’t respond. I had no patience for him, and he damn well knew it.

Victor shifted, then plastered on another one of his fake smiles. “Listen, Matteo, I was hoping you’d reconsider coming to the wedding. It’s going to be quite the event.”

I arched a brow, unimpressed. “Not interested.”

Victor sighed dramatically, shaking his head like I was some rebellious child. “You always were difficult.” Then, as if he had just thought of something amusing, he added with a chuckle, “Though, if you don’t want to come for the family, at least stop by and throw your favorite stepbrother some cash, huh?”

Nobody laughed. Not me. Not Aria.

Victor’s grin faltered when he realized his joke had fallen flat, and he cleared his throat again before shifting gears.

“Ah, where are my manners?” He turned toward Aria, placing a hand on her shoulder like he had any right to. “Matteo, meet my lovely stepdaughter, Aria.”

Stepdaughter.

My eyes flicked to her, watching as she stood rigid beneath his touch. Her earlier flustered expression had been replaced by something more guarded, her lips pressed together as if she were holding something back.

Interesting.

Victor was still talking, saying something about how she was trying on bridesmaid dresses, but I barely heard him. Instead, I focused on her reaction, the way her fingers twitched slightly, how she didn’t look at him when he spoke. There was something there. Something she wasn’t saying.

I tilted my head slightly, smirking as I reached out and extended a hand.

“Hello, Aria,” I said smoothly, watching her eyes widen as she hesitantly placed her hand in mine. “I suppose that makes me your stepuncle.”

Her mouth fell open slightly, clearly thrown off by the comment.

Victor forced out a laugh, trying to brush it off. “Oh, Matteo, always the jokester.”

But I wasn’t joking. Not really. And Aria knew it.

Her hand was warm in mine, her grip not as firm as she probably wanted it to be. I held on for just a second longer than necessary before finally letting go.

She was still staring at me, and this time, I knew exactly what was running through her mind. Who the hell was this guy?

Good. I wanted her wondering.

I took a small step back, sliding my hands into my pockets. “Well, Victor, as much as I’d love to continue this heartwarming family reunion, I have places to be.”

Victor opened his mouth, probably to try one last time to persuade me, but I was already turning away.

Before I walked off, though, I cast one last glance at Aria.

She was still standing there, still watching me. And I didn’t miss the way her lips parted just slightly, like she had something to say but wasn’t sure if she should.

I smirked.

Interesting, indeed.

As I walked toward my car, I could still feel her eyes on me, and for the first time in a long while, I found myself actually looking forward to something.

This wedding might not be such a waste of time after all.

As i entered back into the boutique,bright chandeliers cast a warm golden glow over the elegant dresses displayed on racks. Rows of gowns in soft pastels and shimmering fabrics lined the walls, the air filled with the scent of expensive perfume. I stood in front of a mirror, smoothing down the pale blue dress I had just tried on. The silky fabric felt cool against my skin, but I couldn’t shake the discomfort twisting in my stomach.

“Aria, you look… decent,” my mother, Linda, said, barely sparing me a glance before turning to Cassandra, who twirled in a blush pink dress beside her. “Oh, my sweet girl, you look absolutely stunning!”

I clenched my jaw, swallowing down the sting of being ignored. It was always the same. Cassandra, my foster sister, was always the center of attention, while I faded into the background.

The theme of the wedding wàs blue and white but of course Cassandra could wear whatever she wanted.

Cassandra giggled, admiring herself in the mirror. “Thank's Mom,I love this dress.”

Linda reached out to adjust a strand of Cassandra’s hair, beaming with pride. “You’ll be the most beautiful bridesmaid at the wedding.”

Victor, my stepfather, stood near the doorway, arms crossed as he watched us. His gaze flickered toward me, and I stiffened, instinctively looking away. I never felt comfortable under his scrutiny. His presence always made my skin crawl, but my mother refused to acknowledge it.

“This wedding is a big deal,” he said, his voice smooth yet condescending. “It’s important to look presentable.”

I pressed my lips together and turned back to the mirror, but my heart wasn’t in it. The dress, the boutique, the entire event—it all felt meaningless. My mother’s happiness revolved around this wedding and her new husband, and I was nothing more than an afterthought.

After changing back into my jeans and sweater, I slipped away, my mother too distracted by Cassandra to notice my absence. The cool evening air was a welcome contrast to the suffocating boutique. I took a deep breath, trying to clear my thoughts as I made my way to the bus stop.

\---

The bus ride home was quiet, save for the occasional chatter of passengers. I stared out the window, watching the city lights blur past, my mind replaying the events of the day. But one moment stood out—the moment I had bumped into Matteo Moretti.

His deep-set sapphire eyes, the smirk tugging at his lips, the effortless confidence he carried. *Your stepuncle,* he had introduced himself, as if the title was amusing. There was something about him—something dangerous yet undeniably captivating.

Who exactly was Matteo Moretti?

When I arrived home, I immediately went to my room, eager to escape the chaos of my family. My small apartment, though modest, was my sanctuary. I slipped off my shoes, stretched my aching feet, and settled in front of my laptop.

Curiosity gnawed at me as I typed *Moretti family* into the search bar.

The first article that popped up made my breath catch.

*The Moretti Empire: From Small Beginnings to Billionaire Success.*

I clicked on it, my eyes scanning the page.

*The Moretti brothers, known for their tight control over a chain of exclusive nightclubs and five-star restaurants, have built an empire worth billions...*

My brows furrowed. *Brothers?* I scrolled further.

Matteo Moretti’s face appeared on the screen—a chiseled jawline, jet-black hair styled just messy enough to seem intentional, and those piercing sapphire eyes. But something was off. The article mentioned triplet brothers, yet only Matteo’s photos were available. No pictures, no names, nothing about the other two.

I frowned, clicking on another article. The same thing—mentions of three brothers, but only images of one. It didn’t add up.

Why was Matteo the only one in the spotlight? What were the other two hiding?

A chill ran down my spine. It was almost as if they didn’t exist at all.

I dug deeper, finding more information about their businesses. High-end nightclubs, five-star restaurants, exclusive private events. The Morettis weren’t just rich. They controlled a vast network of power, wealth, and secrecy.

Then, a small mention at the bottom of an article caught my attention.

*The Moretti family has been linked to underground dealings, though no concrete evidence has ever surfaced...*

My heart pounded as I leaned back in my chair. *What have I gotten myself into?*

\---

Closing my laptop, I exhaled slowly, rubbing my temples. The weight of everything settled on my shoulders. A stepfather I didn’t trust, a mother too blinded by love to see it, and now a *stepuncle* with too many secrets.

I stood and walked to the window, my gaze drifting over the city skyline. Somewhere out there, Matteo Moretti was living in luxury, completely unaware that I was trying to figure him out.

But I wasn’t sure if I *wanted* to figure him out.

I sighed and turned away, pushing those thoughts aside. Instead, my mind shifted to work.

I hadn’t been to my vet clinic today. Sarah, my assistant, had assured me everything was fine, but nothing compared to being there. The animals made me feel safe, their trust in me pure and unwavering.

I thought about the golden retriever that had just given birth to a litter of puppies. I had helped deliver them last week, and I missed the soft whimpers and tiny paws reaching out for warmth. Then there was Oliver, the grumpy orange tabby who had finally warmed up to me after months of treating his injured leg.

I sighed, already feeling the pull to be there. Tomorrow, I would throw myself into work. I would forget about the Morettis, about Matteo, and focus on what truly mattered.

Slipping into bed, I let out a tired sigh. My pillow felt cool against my cheek as exhaustion pulled at me. But just before sleep took me, a familiar face flickered in my mind—dark eyes, a teasing smirk, and an unsettling sense of mystery.

Matteo Moretti.

Arias's POV



I had always imagined that if my mom ever had big news, it would be something life-changing, like winning the lottery or deciding we were moving to a tiny house in the middle of nowhere. Something huge.



Instead, she sat across from me at our tiny kitchen table, her perfectly manicured nails tapping against the rim of her coffee cup, and casually announced she was getting married.



Married.



To Victor Castillo.



For a second, I just stared at her, my brain refusing to process what she had just said. Victor Castillo. Victor Castillo. As in, the man who had made my life miserable with his smug little smirks, backhanded compliments, and condescending attitude. The man who always looked at me like I was something stuck to the bottom of his stupid designer shoes.



I swallowed hard, trying to push down the rage bubbling up inside me. My mother tilted her head, her lips curving into a small, expectant smile, like she was waiting for me to leap up and hug her or something. Yeah, right.



“Well?” she finally said, her voice sharp, like a knife slicing through the tension. “Aren’t you going to say anything?”



I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in myears. My fingers curled around the edge of the table, gripping it like it was the only thing keeping me from snapping.



Victor Castillo. The name alone made my skin crawl. How could she even think this was okay? How could she look at me with a straight face and expect me to be happy about this?



Across the table, Cassandra let out an excited squeal, practically vibrating in her seat. Her blonde curls bounced as she clapped her hands together.



“Oh my God, Mom! That’s amazing! Congratulations!” she gushed, her blue eyes sparkling with excitement.



I flinched. Of course she was thrilled.



My mother reached across the table to squeeze Cassandra’s hand, her expression softening in a way it never did when she looked at me. “Thank you, darling. I knew you’d be happy for me.”



I suddenly felt like I couldn’t breathe. Like the air had been sucked out of the room.



“I should go,” I mumbled, pushing my chair back. The sound of the legs scraping against the tile made my teeth clench, but I didn’t care. I needed to get out.



My mother barely spared me a glance. “Of course, you’re always so busy,” she said dismissively, waving a hand like my presence—or lack of it—didn’t matter.



I didn’t look back as I grabbed my bag and headed for the door.



\\---



The walk back to my apartment felt longer than usual, the cold air stinging my cheeks as I replayed the conversation over and over in my head.

1lfyfue,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kermitsky/comments/1lfyfue/the_bedroom_ghost_part_1/,The Bedroom Ghost Part 1,"Let me get ahead of your assumptions: I do not suffer from sleep paralysis. My limbs don’t freeze up, my chest doesn’t experience heavy pressures, and I do *not* hallucinate. I’ve seen professionals, spoken with experts, and have spent more money than I care to mention to get a diagnosis. So far, I’ve only ever been told I’m sane and my only prescription has been sleep. 

I write this to preface that I am of the utmost sound mind, apparently, and what I have been experiencing for the last year is not the result of fevered delusions. Apparently. There’s a ghost in my house, which I’ve come to call the “Bedroom Ghost,” because I only ever see him in bedrooms. I know, no points for creativity, but I can’t think of a name that suits him otherwise. Sometimes he’s in my upstairs bedroom, sometimes the kids’ on the first floor, sometimes the spare guest room across from mine. He doesn’t walk the halls to the various bedrooms, not that I’ve seen, and he doesn’t sit in the corner of your eye when you’re in any other part of the house. If you want to see him, he’s going to be in a bedroom.

Most people, I think, don’t really know how they’d react if they saw a ghost. I’d wager even the artists, authors, and moviemakers tend to get it wrong. You don’t turn a ghastly white, you don’t shriek, you don’t run. At least, I didn’t, and I consider myself as average as it gets. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still damn scary. But in that moment, it feels, I don’t know, foolish to get up and run or scream. It just happens too fast for any of that. I think the scariest thing, the thing that really lingers, is the fact that it’s *real*. One second the world is more or less how you think it is, and the next, you’ve seen a ghost. It changes the way you see everything once you have some assurance that there’s a world disconnected from our bodies and matter and everything else our physics has so far defined. But the philosophical ramifications of the existence of the Bedroom Ghost are not what I’m here to discuss with you.

My message is actually a good deal briefer than a dissertation on the reality of the spiritual. Like  I said, I’m average, and those ideas sit a level or two above my pay grade. I’m going to speak to you plainly: 

The Bedroom Ghost is evil. 

You can stop there if you want, because everything I’ve got to say now is just an elaboration on that fact. But do not forget it. I don’t know if this ghost is specific to my bedroom, or if he has a plethora of bedrooms he forays into in the evenings, or if he’s one of a tribe of similarly goaled entities. I don’t see him every night, but I’m sure he keeps busy. So if there’s a chance that one evening, as the moon climbs high and your thoughts begin to wander with decreasing effort into nonsensical dreaming, and you see the glimmer of white eyes ever so faintly in the crack of your closet door, heed these next words, because you may be receiving a visit from the Bedroom Ghost. 

And the Bedroom Ghost is evil. 

I first saw him one evening when I couldn’t sleep. I’d lived in the house for a while even then, at least five years. My wife had gone to bed before me, per usual, and the kids had gone down at least an hour before her. I enjoyed that quiet time in the evening, a couple of hours just spent reading or playing games or watching a movie that was too violent for my kids or too frightening for my wife. Some guys have an old car in their garage, others have shed beers, others a man-cave with a pool table and stocked bar, but for me, the dark, quiet, midnight house was my escape.

I’d spent the evening watching a bad zombie flick on my laptop, rocking back and forth in the living room recliner, listening to the sounds of exaggerated carnage and corpseish moans, the only light coming from the glowing blue aurora of my screen. When the credits rolled, the clock read just after midnight. Time for me to turn in.

I crept up the stairs, cautious to avoid the creak on the seventh step, and shuffled down the hallway using my phone screen as a flashlight. Whenever I made this walk, I felt like the modern visage of Ebeneezer Scrooge with his candlestick, though I swapped the evening gown for a pair of sweatpants. On that particular night, I was strangely reminded of what it was like to wander a dark hallway alone as a kid, when all the doors and walls are three feet taller, and the darkness is alive with whatever your imagination deems to exist in those shadowy corners. Even as an adult, you don’t really lose that sense of unease, although your ability to rationalize it away is stronger.

I crossed into my room, switched off my phone, and using my own muscle memory of the space, navigated the dark until I was slipping into bed with my wife. I lay there for a while, the images of the movie I had just finished playing in a mental slideshow of cheap effects and lazy dialogue. After maybe ten minutes, I thought sleep would come. It didn’t. My mind wandered a little, the beginnings of a dream beginning to form, but it stopped suddenly at a stir from Elizabeth. I rolled to my other side and tried again. A few more minutes rolled by and my thoughts still would not quiet.

I suspected with growing dread that I may be suffering from another bout of insomnia, an affliction that hit me once or twice a month that made the next day a living hell. Deciding I didn’t want to be a zombie myself at work tomorrow, I resolved to rummage up a melatonin from the medicine cabinet. I sat up, opened my eyes, and froze.

My closet, across from my bed, was the gate to a black nowhere six feet from the footboard. And hovering still and silent in that space, just above and to the right of the coat hangers, was a moon. Only it wasn’t a moon, of course it wasn’t a moon. It just looked like one, pale and placid, round and illuminescent, suspended against a black, starless, sky. And like the moon, it had a face. But this face wasn’t a pattern of craters. It was shimmering white teeth, a large flat nose, and two black eyes, each bright and intelligent. It was grinning.

Its hairless visage was both old and young, old in its size, but infantile in its energy, the fullness of its cheeks, the roundness of its chin burgeoning double chin. And its mind, obvious to me somehow even in those first seconds, was ageless.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t even jump. It looked at me and I looked back at it. There wasn’t any point trying to rationalize it. I wasn’t hallucinating, I wasn’t paralyzed in bed, and I wasn’t dreaming. My hands and feet were shaking, while a sick, cold wind blew out from the closet where it stood or floated, passing through the sheets of my bed as I lay uncovered and bare. There was no way to think about what I could or should do. I didn’t think to wake my wife or grab my phone or leave the room. There was something a little wondrous to that first night, and strange as it may sound, I didn’t want to turn my head only to look back and find it gone. Some people spend their whole lives looking for something like this, something inexplicable, something truly preternatural. On that first night, buried beneath the shock and terror and dread, I felt almost privileged to be able to look at it, even though I could have vomited up my own heart at any second.

Maybe it was my fear, maybe it was the aforementioned shock, maybe it was just the automatic response system of the human body taking over, but as I sat there staring at the pale grinning visage, I did something I can’t really account for. I lifted up my right hand just to my shoulder, and with a little shake, waved at the face.

Its smile broadened.

I still didn’t have words. At the time, I wondered if I’d ever regain the ability to speak. The Ghost didn’t have much to offer at that time either by way of conversation, but in response, I saw a small, disembodied hand, chubby and the same pallid shade as the face, appear from the depths of the closet and gently wave back at me.

Then, the face receded into the shadows, the long white teeth the last feature to vanish.

I sat up that night for I don’t know how long. Hours, maybe. I did fall asleep, I must have, because I remember waking up to an alarm and the sounds of my wife readying Duncan and Delphi for school. Of course I was useless that day, both at home and at work. I couldn’t think of anything other than my nocturnal visitor. I didn’t tell Elizabeth about what I saw for the reasons you’d expect: I didn’t want her to think that we lived in a cursed house, or that I was just insane. I’m not insane. Instead, I shambled downstairs, poured my cup of coffee, nodded blankly at the list of to-do items Elizabeth had magneted to the fridge for the day, tied my shoes, and drove to work.

I consider myself a fairly diligent person, but at work that day I didn’t do a damn thing other than scour the internet for any sort of answer on what I might have seen. Most of the search results suggested sleep paralysis, which I had already ruled out. Like I said, I waved at it. Can’t do that if you can’t move. The other options could be limited to two broad categories: ghosts and demons, although, depending on who you asked, there may not have been much difference between the two. At this point, I probably should’ve done the normal thing and contacted a priest, or a reverend, or someone who knew God better than I did. Of course I, having just seen a ghost, was still somehow too rational to consider the possibility that God could help. Or maybe, perhaps more honestly, there was a part of me that didn’t want to run the thing off. I remember believing that God had never bothered to show His face in my closet before, never once given me a how-do-you-do. Whatever this thing was, it at least had the decency to wave back. 

What a damn fool thing to believe.

The next couple of weeks went unremarkably. I’d sit up for an hour or two in bed, sometimes with a laptop or a paperback, sometimes with nothing at all but an eye for the open closet door. The face didn’t reappear. The cold wind didn’t blow out. And the shadows did not stir.

I refused to write off the first experience as anything other than factual reality. I knew what I saw, believed in it. I would not convince myself otherwise for the sake of rationalizing. I think I did a decent job keeping the thing to myself as well. I regained my composure after the first day, resumed my work and family obligations, but I really only had one thought buzzing around in my head. I mean, who in my place wouldn’t? Like I said earlier: Undisputed proof of the preternatural, evidence of something beyond just ourselves. Sure, it wasn’t scientific data, tested and peer-reviewed, but it was enough for me. Had I never seen the ghost again, I wonder if I might have sunk further into my obsession with it, forever chasing that singular moment where every truth of the universe I thought self-evident was overturned.

For better or worse, that was not to be my last encounter with the Bedroom Ghost. It was a Saturday. Elizabeth had taken the kids to their gymnastics lesson with her sister. I stayed behind to catch up on some chores. For the first time in weeks, I wasn’t actively thinking about the Ghost. I was just walking down the hall with a basket of dirty laundry in my arms. I walked out of our bedroom and towards Delphine’s. I was reaching for the knob when suddenly the door began pounding from the inside. I dropped the basket and stumbled back as the hinges shook and the wood vibrated, dust flying from the door frame with each rhythmic slam from the other side. 

 

“Phi-Phi, you still here? Didn’t Mom take you to gymnastics?” I know, stupid questions, I had literally watched them leave.

“Don’t open the door, Daniel.” A voice from the inside said. It was low and silky, a baritone stronger suited for song than speech. Yet it seemed genderless, ageless, both a man and a woman’s voice, a child’s and a crone’s.

I didn’t open the door. I didn’t pick up the basket. I didn’t move an inch.

“Police report eleven fatalities after a city bus blew a tire on interstate seventy-five,” the voice said suddenly, its tone switching from its impossible combination to that of a female news anchor. “Witnesses to the tragic accident state that the bus’s back right tire blew out, causing the tail end to swerve into a tractor-trailer truck behind it. The resulting collision led to traffic trailing the two vehicles into a pile-up that is measured to be the deadliest traffic accident of the year.”

I didn’t know what to say, what to think, before the voice changed again. It was a man’s voice, but it was accented in what might have been Russian (it was muffled by the door between us), but it still sounded like a news anchor.

“The latest UN security council numbers indicate the drone strike killed at least seven members of army top brass. There’s not much way of validating these numbers, as the administration is reluctant to report any losses.”

Then the voice changed again.

“I’m so, so, sorry ma’am.” It was a man’s voice, but it was an American accent, maybe from the South. It sounded on the brink of breaking. “I couldn’t see her. We’ve always used this land for hunting, got the warning signs up and everything. I just saw movement by the bait and…”

Then, it was just a shriek. A woman’s shriek, loud, agonized, an answer to the stuttering man’s voice from a second before.

By then, I had collapsed, slumped against the wall, pressing my hands to my ears.

“Daniel,” the voice said in its original impossible intonation. “Daniel.” I didn’t answer. “Daniel.”

“What?!” I demanded.

Nothing. The voice made no answer. Then, it repeated, “Daniel.”

“Who are you?” Now that I had found my voice, I remembered how to use it. “How did you- what was all that?”

“Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.”

“*What!*” I repeated. There was another pause. Then,

“Daniel.”

In a moment of horror that was somehow worse than even listening to the gruesome reports it had just channeled, I realized that the Ghost was taunting me. Like a playground bully. For lack of a better way of putting it, the Ghost was simply being mean.

“Daniel.”

“Daniel.”

“Daniel.” 

“Don’t open the door, Daniel.”

I didn’t. You couldn’t have paid me to. I left the basket of spilled clothes on the floor and ran down the hall, jammed my toe on the leg of my sofa as I passed through my living room, and stumbled out my front door in sheer animal panic. My chest heaved and for a moment the only sound I could hear was the blood rushing behind my ears. After a few minutes, I mustered the mental might to confront what had just happened. 

It had to be the same entity that I’d seen in the closet. It must’ve been. Or maybe it was like the movie *Poltergeist*? Maybe it was a thousand ghosts. Maybe that was how it did all the voices. But I couldn’t know, not for sure. The one I’d seen initially was silent as the grave, nothing more than a face and hand. Whatever was behind my daughter’s bedroom door wasn’t silent.

*Rap. Rap. Rap.*

My thoughts were interrupted by a bird pecking one of the downstairs windows. I peeked out from under the porch to see if I could spot the animal, but it wasn’t there anymore. I figured it flew away.  

I determined that maybe I would have to move my family out of that place. That made sense, and it was the first thing everyone says the family should do in a haunted house movie. 

*Rap. Rap. Rap.*

That damn bird pecked the window again. I looked up, but still, nothing.

*Moving*, I thought, ignoring the distraction. *It’ll take some convincing, but I can probably get Elizabeth to leave. The kids, too. They’re young enough that they won’t be forever changed by a quick hop across state lines.* I wiped some sweat from my forehead, the clear midday sky and idyllic weather mocking my delirium.

*Crack!*

I caught it that time. The bird, a crow I think, was flying away from a hole it had just pecked into the window to…

Delphi’s room.

That’s right, that’s where her room was. First floor, just beside the door. I should’ve put two and two together and realized that something was up. But I’d have been damned if I was going to go inspect the damage. 

A shape started stuffing itself through the newly created gap in the glass. Struggled to make it out, but slowly, as it twisted and wriggled through the little space, I recognized it as a rolled up piece of notebook paper. Something behind the closed blinds was shoving it through the window, sending particles of broken glass down into the flowerbed beneath it. . After a moment, it, too, fell to the ground.

I was already halfway to my car, keys in hand, when I felt that same cold wind bow from the house behind me, a totally foreign feeling on such a warm day. Something brushed against my calf. 

No longer able to ignore it, I leaned down and picked up the rolled piece of paper. I flattened it out and held the curled edges open with each hand. One word in perfect, typeface-like print, was written on the top left side of the paper, indented even, as if opening a paragraph.

It feels like a slow growth, but really it's doing well. Just wondering if a degree once I graduate high-school, my construction job, and this business are actually college worthy.

So I started a business about two years ago when I was fourteen and uh, i've basically been bootstrapping and just saving for the last 2 years, I'm about to get my license and uh, yeah, yeah, the business actually has. Really good assets. I mean, there's been a lot put into it. My family's helped me a ton. My girlfriend helps me and uh, between everything that I've saved up. And basically my truck is my company car. My coffee business has around 27,000 - 34,000 invested in if you assume everything I bought was it's market value (  I scavenge every crevice of the internet for cheap stuff ) so essentially, what I'm asking is it's kind of a rant as well? But essentially, what i'm asking is, if I presumably was trying to get a job in business management/marketing, would the business be actually like a reputable asset to use in terms of like an application talking point and also it's a coffee business. But I'm doing construction, hopefully this summer, and definitely through junior and senior year. Um, uh, to learn the loops and just kind of get familiar with stuff. Because I find it like an asset as well. What i'm asking is what a construction job that has nothing correlated with a coffee business and a degree be a good beginning job application.I guess talking points... voice text goes* so I don't know, am I just overreacting or yeah, is it not? Enough, it just feels like I don't. I really have that much with my business. There's not like, hmm, that much stuff. But when I actually evaluate, we have quite a lot of money, put into the business, especially for only 6 Events like it just doesn't feel as crazy in person.

Chapter 1  
  
In their third year of marriage, Emma's wedding certificate was accidentally ruined by spilled coffee.  
  
When she went to the county clerk's office to replace it, the clerk typed a few keystrokes and looked up with a puzzled expression. ""Ma'am, your marital status shows as single.""  
  
She froze, certain she'd misheard. ""That's impossible. My husband and I got our license right here three years ago.""  
  
The clerk checked again, her expression growing increasingly awkward. ""The system confirms you're single, but Mr. Chase is listed as married..."" She hesitated. ""His spouse is registered as another woman—Stella Reed. Do you know her?""  
  
Emma's mind exploded with white noise, her ears ringing sharply.  
  
Everyone knew Emma and Dominic Chase had grown up together. She was his first love, the one he'd protected fiercely since childhood.  
  
And Stella Reed?  
  
She was the replacement Dominic had found during the two years Emma studied abroad—someone to fill the void when he missed her too much.  
  
\---  
  
Emma clutched the coffee-stained fake marriage certificate as she numbly got into her car.  
  
Her phone vibrated twice, and Dominic's message appeared on the screen.  
  
\[Baby, I ditched a billion-dollar deal, bought your favorite roses and that strawberry cake you love, just so I could come home early to be with you. I miss you so much. Do you miss me?\]  
  
She stared at the message and let out a hollow laugh that quickly dissolved into tears streaming down her cheeks.  
  
For three years, he'd asked her that same question daily, expressing his supposed devotion.  
  
But all along... he'd been legally married to someone else behind her back.  
  
She remembered when they were children, how Dominic had fallen from a ten-foot tree trying to retrieve her kite, breaking his arm but still smiling as he handed her the kite, saying, ""Don't cry, Em. It doesn't hurt.""  
  
She remembered her fifteenth birthday, when he stood in the rain outside her house all night just to be the first to wish her happy birthday when she woke up.  
  
She remembered her eighteenth birthday celebration, when he rented an entire amusement park and knelt beneath exploding fireworks, saying, ""Emma, when I turn twenty-two, will you marry me?""  
  
She remembered when she left to study abroad, how he'd pressed her against the airport wall, his voice trembling: ""Two years. I'm only giving you two years, and then I'm coming to bring you back.""  
  
During those two years overseas, he video-called almost daily.  
  
Once when she was too busy with essays to answer for three days, she discovered he'd been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.  
  
Through the screen, his bloodshot eyes pleaded: ""Baby, I can't live without you.""  
  
She always reassured him: ""I'll be home soon. Just wait a little longer.""  
  
The day she returned, she didn't tell Dominic, wanting to surprise him.  
  
Instead, when she pushed open the door to his private club room, she found him passionately kissing a girl whose profile looked strikingly similar to her own.  
  
Her bag dropped with a thud, and she fled.  
  
Dominic chased after her like a madman. When she wouldn't answer his calls, he bombarded her with messages. When she refused to see him, he stood in the rain outside her apartment, explaining over and over.  
  
""It's not what you think!""  
  
""I missed you so much these years when you wouldn't let me visit, so I found someone who reminded me of you...""  
  
""I swear, we just hugged and kissed, nothing more!""  
  
""Emma, I was wrong, but I truly love you to the point of insanity...""  
  
Finally, after he stood in the rain for three days and nights, collapsing with pneumonia and still refusing to leave the hospital, her heart softened, and she forgave him.  
  
Afterward, he treated her just as wonderfully as before.  
  
Until after they married, when she discovered his assistant had been replaced by Stella Reed. That ""replacement"" he claimed to have sent away.  
  
He explained again: ""Her parents are sick, and they struggled adjusting to the city life. She begged to come back to North Bay...""  
  
""She applied for my assistant position without my knowledge.""  
  
""She's exceptionally qualified and passed all the selection rounds. I can't just fire her without cause.""  
  
So Emma tolerated it again.  
  
Never imagining that her tolerance would turn her into the butt of a cosmic joke.  
  
As her car pulled into their gated community, Emma's tears had dried.  
  
She took a deep breath, about to push open the front door when she overheard Dominic talking with his friend in the living room:  
  
""I just came from the hospital. Stella's fine, just some minor scrapes. You should stay home with Emma, don't worry.""  
  
Dominic lounged on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed. He frowned and extinguished his friend's cigarette, his voice low and cold: ""How many times have I told you not to smoke in my house? Emma hates the smell.""  
  
""Fine, fine, you obsessive husband,"" his friend teased. ""But I really don't understand—if you love Emma so much, why did you insist on marrying Stella? Honestly, is she more than just a replacement to you?""  
  
The air stilled for several seconds.  
  
Then Dominic's deep voice broke the silence:  
  
""What if she is?""  
  
""I used to think she was just a stand-in until Emma returned. Then I wouldn't need her anymore.""  
  
""But after sending her away, I dreamed about her almost every night.""  
  
""Eventually I couldn't stand her not being near me, so I brought her back as my assistant.""  
  
""I can't live without Emma, but Stella... I can't let her go either.""  
  
""Emma gets my public devotion, while Stella stays in the shadows with a marriage certificate as compensation. What's wrong with that?""  
  
His friend sighed. ""Aren't you afraid Emma will find out? With her personality, if she ever discovers this, you could die at her feet and she'd never look back.""  
  
Dominic fell silent, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. ""Then she'll never find out.""  
  
Emma stood frozen outside the door, feeling her blood turn to ice. She'd expected to break down sobbing, but found she couldn't even squeeze out a tear.  
  
So this was what absolute pain felt like—like having your heart carved out while it still beat.  
  
She thought about how Dominic had tenderly kissed her forehead that morning before leaving; how he'd hold her when drunk and murmur, ""Baby, I can't live without you""; how he'd warm her cold hands against his chest, saying his heart beat only for her…  
  
But it was all a lie.  
  
On her way home, she'd even wondered if he had some desperate explanation.  
  
Now she knew—he hadn't chosen between two women. He'd wanted both: one as his public beloved, one as his legal wife.  
  
Fine!  
  
If Dominic feared her finding out, she'd show him what ""never looking back"" truly meant.  
  
She turned and left, immediately doing two things...  
  
Chapter 2  
  
First, she applied to cancel all her identity information in the country.  
  
Second, she changed her name.  
  
The clerk informed her all paperwork would be processed within two weeks.  
  
After two weeks, even if Dominic searched heaven and earth, he'd never find her.  
  
Emma turned and left, her phone buzzing frantically in her bag—all missed calls and messages from Dominic.  
  
She didn't look or respond.  
  
By the time she returned home, night had fallen.  
  
Dominic stood in the living room, rushing toward her the moment she entered, his eyes filled with obvious anxiety: ""Baby, where have you been? I came home and couldn't find you. I've been waiting for hours, nearly turned the whole city upside down looking for you.""  
  
His concern seemed genuine.  
  
Emma stared at him, her heart seized by an invisible hand.  
  
She suddenly remembered high school, when he'd abandoned a math competition mid-exam to rush back when she was an hour late responding to his message, terrified something had happened to her.  
  
A man who clearly loved her so much, someone she once believed saw her as the most important person in his world. Yet looking at everything now, the love he gave was never truly exclusive.  
  
Her throat felt blocked, making every breath painful, but ultimately, she replied calmly, ""I went shopping and forgot to tell you. Sorry.""  
  
Only then did Dominic finally relaxed, pulling her into his arms: ""Don't apologize. I wasn't angry, just worried.""  
  
As he spoke, he kissed the top of her head, his tone gentle: ""Alright baby, you mentioned the other day you were craving those sweet and tangy BBQ ribs and that herb-crusted sea bass. I'll make them for you right now, okay?""  
  
With that, he released her and headed to the kitchen.  
  
Emma stood at the doorway, silently watching Dominic. He rolled up his shirt sleeves, his long fingers skillfully chopping vegetables, his profile looking especially gentle in the warm light.  
  
She suddenly remembered how, three years ago when she first returned, her chronic stomach problems from irregular eating had hospitalized her.  
  
Back then, Dominic—a billionaire CEO who'd never cooked—spent a month learning from top chefs to prepare proper meals for her.  
  
Once, when an international video conference clashed with his cooking time, he propped his tablet in the kitchen, listening to reports while stir-frying, shocking his executives.  
  
He once loved her so intensely, as if his entire universe revolved around her.  
  
But right now? The second his phone buzzed, his expression subtly shifted, and he immediately set down the knife, hastily wiping his hands.  
  
""Baby, there's an emergency at the company. I need to go in."" He removed his apron, his tone casual, even remembering to kiss her forehead. ""I've finished three dishes. Eat first, don't wait for me.""  
  
Emma said nothing, just nodded.  
  
After he left, she approached the dining table, looking at the still-steaming dishes, her chest suddenly too painful to breathe.  
  
She'd just seen clearly—that call was from Stella.  
  
Instead of sitting down to eat as he'd asked, she called a car and followed him.  
  
Sure enough, Dominic wasn't headed to the company but to the hospital.  
  
In the VIP wing corridor, the entire floor had been cleared, with only a few doctors and nurses standing outside a room, looking tense.  
  
The hospital director was bowing apologetically to Dominic: ""Mr. Chase, we're truly sorry. It was our negligence that allowed Ms. Reed to slip in the bathroom. We'll assign additional staff and ensure this never happens again!""  
  
Dominic's face was grim, his voice icy: ""If there's a next time, this hospital won't stay in business.""  
  
The director nodded repeatedly: ""Yes, yes, we'll be extremely careful!""  
  
Emma stood at the corner, her fingernails digging into her palms.  
  
His friend had mentioned Stella only had ""minor scrapes."" Yet Dominic had reserved an entire building for her, and now that something had happened, he looked ready to tear down the hospital.  
  
The door opened, revealing Stella lying weakly against the headboard, pale-faced with reddened eyes.  
  
Dominic strode over, grabbing her hand: ""How are you? Where does it hurt?""  
  
Stella's eyes welled up, her voice choked: ""This is all my fault. Getting hit by a car was bad enough, but then falling in the shower? Now you can't even spend time with Emma... What if she gets suspicious? I'm like a walking disaster magnet...""  
  
""Don't talk nonsense,"" he scolded, though his tone remained gentle. ""Just focus on recovering. I'll stay with you these next few days.""  
  
Stella looked up with tear-filled eyes: ""But what about Emma?""  
  
Dominic replied dismissively: ""I'll handle it. Don't worry.""  
  
After a pause, he added: ""We're husband and wife. Isn't it natural for me to stay with you?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Emma's blood instantly froze.  
  
Husband and wife? What fine words.  
  
But before she could recover, she watched Dominic remove the prayer beads from his wrist and gently place them on Stella's hand.  
  
""And stop calling yourself a disaster,"" he said. ""These blessed beads—I've worn them for seven years. Now they're yours to keep you safe.""  
  
Tears streaming down her face, Stella lunged forward with overwhelming emotion and threw herself into his arms.  
  
Emma stood outside, her vision blurring as if drowning in deep water. Her entire being felt like it was suffocating.  
  
Those prayer beads...  
  
She'd gotten them on her eighteenth birthday, crawling on her knees through the pilgrimage path, performing the traditional prostration every few yards all the way from the mountain base to the abbey summit.  
  
That day, torrential rain had soaked the ground, leaving her knees bleeding and palms raw by the time the abbot finally blessed the beads in the sacred ritual.  
  
When she returned, Dominic saw her battered state and immediately reddened eyes, pulling her into his arms, his voice trembling: ""Emma, have you lost your mind? Who made you suffer like this?""  
  
She'd smiled, placing the beads on his wrist: ""The abbot said these will keep you safe and grant you longevity.""  
  
He'd kissed her, promising: ""I'll wear them for life.""  
  
For seven years, he never removed them. Not during the most formal business occasions, not during their most intimate moments—the beads remained on his wrist.  
  
But now, he'd placed them on another woman's hand.  
  
Witnessing this scene with her own eyes, her heart felt like it was being slowly carved open with a dull blade, the pain so intense she could barely breathe.  
  
So his ""lifetime"" had lasted just seven years.  
  
She turned to leave, her steps unsteady as if walking on cotton.  
  
By the time she returned home, night had fallen.  
  
She'd barely entered when her phone vibrated with Dominic's message:  
  
\[Baby, the company has an urgent matter abroad. I'll be gone for a few days. Don't be angry; I'll make it up to you when I return.\]  
  
Emma stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, trembling slightly as she typed:  
  
\[Is it really a few days for business, or a few days with your wife?\]  
  
But ultimately, she deleted the words one by one, tears falling onto the screen, blurring her vision.  
  
After that, she spent the time packing—documents, passport, bank cards... everything that could prove her identity went into her suitcase.  
  
Three days later, Dominic returned.  
  
He pushed open the door carrying a large bouquet of roses and a strawberry cake, smiling tenderly: ""Baby, I'm back.""  
  
Emma stood in the center of the living room, silently watching him.  
  
He approached, placing the flowers and cake on the table, reaching to embrace her: ""Work was incredibly busy these past few days, requiring my presence overseas. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left you for so long. Don't be angry, okay?""  
  
She shifted slightly, avoiding his embrace, her tone flat: ""I'm not angry. Go take care of your business.""  
  
He paused, then smiled: ""I'm done with work. Now my job is to make you happy.""  
  
He took her hand, his eyes expectant: ""I've prepared a surprise for you.""  
  
Without waiting for her response, he led her to the car.  
  
Half an hour later, they stopped before a concert hall.  
  
Emma walked inside to find the entire venue had been reserved, with people seated around, whispering as they entered:  
  
""Mr. Chase really went all out, renting the entire concert hall just for Emma!""  
  
""Word is he flew in her favorite orchestra from Europe—they're playing exclusively for her all day long.""  
  
""That ensemble's fee has skyrocketed lately. This must have cost him seven figures, minimum.""  
  
""Please—that's nothing. His reputation for spoiling his wife is practically legendary!""  
  
Emma stood in the brilliant light, surrounded by admiring whispers, while Dominic's tender smile filled her vision.  
  
Yet her heart felt submerged in ice water, painfully cold.  
  
He gave her grand gestures and romance, while giving another woman legal marriage.  
  
He let her live in the spotlight of public admiration, while letting another woman exist on his marriage certificate.

For years, my antidepressants (currently Lexapro 20mg + Mirtazapine 15mg) have been successful at controlling my severe anxiety. The problem is, it feels like this has come at the cost of my entire dopamine system. I constantly struggle with:

* Very low motivation and life energy (anhedonia).
* Zero spontaneous libido.
* A general feeling of ""flatness.""

The only ""tool"" I had to get a boost of motivation was a morning coffee. However, the side effects are too severe for me: it makes my Meniere's disease (vertigo) symptoms much worse, makes me irritable, anxious, and ruins my sleep. Quitting coffee for even a week makes me feel deeply depressed.

I've already tried the standard ""lifestyle"" advice consistently for over a year (intense exercise, strict diet with no sugar, cold showers, meditation). While they provide temporary relief, they haven't been a permanent solution to this core feeling of low drive.

I am **not** looking to add another medication like Wellbutrin to counteract the side effects.

So, my question to the long-haulers is:

**How do you personally and sustainably manage the low motivation, anhedonia, and low energy that comes with long-term antidepressant use,** ***without*** **relying on stimulants like caffeine or adding more medication?**

1lfybk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1lfybk0/internal_stimulation/,Internal stimulation,"Yo this shit is real! 😀

Key thing to understand:

Internal vs. External stimulation

Our world and mainstream mediocre society is based on external stimulation. Coffee in the morning, cigarettes, (emotional) dense food, drugs of choice, entertainment, even exercise can actually be external stimuli, toxic validating relationships, you name it…

But health and sovereignty and love is not based outside but inside. This is the power we are tapping when practicing SR the essence of our existence - in absolutely literal way. We are slowly becoming self-sustained. It starts with minding our business more, cuting energetic drains, lessening the dependency on caffeine, sugar spikes, dopamin spikes, external love and validation. A lot of people report eating less, but having more energy.

Basically anything we ingest/absorb can be made redundant if we grow our energy enough.

A lot of people report benefits while eating a lot of meat or even still drinking caffeine or herbs or whatever. Yes, of course you will get benefits, you get the energy from outside and keep it for some time to do things and manifest things etc. but thats not the point. Its not coming from inside. Those of you having hard time, flat-lines, emotional instability - keep on. You are on the right path and when the storms are gone you will be much better off than those still dependent on dense external energies.

Im sure somebody will oppose me saying that he feels better ingesting all kinds of things. Yea bruda you still escaping the feelings that you need to process and holding to you favourite substance like a likkle dependent bih.

Its tough love. Bless

Chapter 1 “Yayo, yayo Moo la lah Yayo Bitch better have my money, Y’all should know me well enough, Bitch better have my money, Please don’t call me on my bluff, Pay me what you owe me, Ballin’ bigger than LeBron, Bitch, give me your money, Who y’all think y’all frontin on? Like brrap, brrap, brrap “ “Jesus Christ” I shrieked when I saw the old lady that was lurking behind me, giving me the stink eye disgusted. “I want a copy of Macbeth, rental two weeks period.” I tried to slow my heartbeats and move. This woman almost gave me a heart attack. I went to the shelves to get her the book she wanted, and who buys or rents a book this late? It’s 10 pm for God’s sake. Isn’t she afraid that someone would rob her or, worse, kill her? “Here you go ma’am, this would be.....” “I know what the cost is, here.” She threw the money on the counter and went mumbling something about kids these days who have no shame. Wow, I love Sundays; they are the best start of a productive week, so that’s why people are so peachy. “Ariel, please clean up and close. I’ve to go. Haley just called, and she is throwing a tantrum.” “OK Daniel, have a good night.” He didn’t give me the chance to reply and left me screaming after him, ugh why me? Why did Jason have to take the day off? I went to the kitchen and checked that everything was clean and gathered the garbage bags, then went to the back door to throw them out. You see, I work at a library slash coffee shop so you can read your favorite book and enjoy your drink. Sometimes we rent books only for the regulars, so I’m sort of a librarian, waitress, and barista. I’m a senior. I live with my mom who is a nurse, by the way. I don’t need money actually, but I work to pay for my piano lessons. My mom works so hard to afford the college money for me. I want to be a doctor, so yeah I need a little fortune, that’s why I’m working to pay for my piano lessons. I wanted to help her. I’m not a shameless girl, as the nice lady said a few moments ago. I sighed and threw the bags next to the others in the alley and when I was about to leave; I heard someone groaning and froze. Oh my god, what is that? What should I do? Is this for real or just my imagination? But again I heard it. I swallowed hard and turned back slowly, then took hesitant steps farther into the dark alley. My breath hitched when I saw a body behind a big bile of garbage and again froze, staring with wide eyes. In front of me was a man clutching his stomach and groaning in pain. And without thinking, I ran to him. “Oh my god, oh my god. Sir...... Sir Are you OK? Jesus, I’m gonna call 911.” The man held my hand and looked in my eyes and said “D.... Don’t please, just get me out of here.” “But... But you are bleeding so hard, and I think you lost so much blood. You need to go to the hospital. “ “No... NO PLEASE, just help me to get out of here.” I chewed on my lower lip, thinking about what to do. The thing is, I live in Queens, and..... ugh you got the picture. The man tugged on my hoodie sleeve and that did it for me. I put one of his arms around my neck and I slipped my right hand around his waist and started to stand up and boy, was he heavy. I held dragged him all the way inside into the kitchen and closed the door. While I was about to drag him out to my mom’s car, I heard the sound of the front door’s bell. Someone is here. I put him in the corner behind the small counter and was about to see who came, but the man held my right hand in a death grip and shook his head no. “It’s ok? Don’t worry, I’m gonna be ok.” I whispered. He dropped his hand reluctantly and let me go; I gave him a small reassuring smile and headed to the door to see who was there. “We are closed, sirs,” I said with a weak smile to the three bulky men who were looking around suspiciously. “Oh, I see. Did a man come here, or did you see him pass by?” the tallest one asked. “This is a library, sir; a lot of men come here to read books.” “This one is no ordinary man. Well built, 6.5 foot, tan skin, dark hair, amber eyes, stabbed, bleeding,” He said, smirking. “Oh, umm no, I don’t think I saw him. Do you want to check the cameras? Maybe he came at the morning shift. I wasn’t here sorry.” He narrowed his eyes and tried to see if I was lying, so I fluttered my eyelashes and gave my most innocent look I’ve. “Alessio, let’s go.“ One of the other two men told the hulk in front of me. Alessio gave me another look and went out with the others. I let out the breath I didn’t know that I was holding and slid to the ground. After ten seconds, I regained the ability to walk again and went back to the man in the kitchen. “Sir..... sir wake up, God is he dead.” I kneeled and checked his pulse, no he’s still alive, just fainted. He’s still bleeding profoundly. I left again and closed everything, the light and the front door, then drove my car to the back alley. I looked around carefully to see if anyone was watching me, and when I was sure that nothing was wrong. I opened the back door and dragged the man to the car, and headed home. Thank god I was living three blocks away, other days I just walk. But today when my mom knew that I’ll be late she gave me her car. Again I dragged held the very heavy unconscious man to my room, which was on the second floor. Lucky me. My weak knees just gave up the moment I entered; the stranger and I were on the floor. I was breathing so hard and him groaning. “Hey wake up, please. I can’t drag you around anymore. I’m not that strong, trust me.” He moaned and flattered, his eyes open. “Where am I?” he looked around suspiciously. “Ah...... Um, after these three scary men left. I couldn’t let you stay at the library, so I brought you here to my house...... umm this is my room.” With wide eyes, the man looked at me, surprised. But actually, it was me, the surprised one. This was the first time I took a good look at his face. The first thing I saw was amber. His eyes were the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life, two golden gems with a hint of green. Red full lips, straight nose crocked a little, rough stubble dusting his sharp jawline and a cute dimple on right. His groaning made me snap out of my trance and remembered what’s going on. With hot red cheeks, I stood up. “Umm.... can you stand up? We need to go to the bathroom to clean your wounds.” I didn’t wait for his answer. I just ran there. After a minute or so, the stranger came wobbling. He lost a lot of blood; I was astonished that he can even open his eyes. “Hey......Would you please sit here?” I closed the toilet seat and opened the first aid kit and looked for scissors, then faced him to cut his dress shirt. “What the hell you think you are doing?” he growled. I winced when he held my right wrist in a death grip. “I need to check your wound. It’s still bleeding so hard, and your clothes must be sticky. It’s gonna hurt if you tried to take them off. I need to cut them.“ He narrowed his eyes. “And if you check it, what can you do about it? Nothing.” “Look, you don’t want to go to the hospital. You’re bleeding, and your wound needs to be cleaned at least.” He let my hand hesitantly. I helped him take off his jacket and tried to take off his dress shirt, but it was sticky like I thought. With all the bleeding and the open flesh, it was like glue. So I used the scissors to cut it open. I tried so hard not to flush when I saw his naked torso; it was a sight to behold. Broad wide shoulders with lots of muscles, defined strong abs and on his left pectoral, there was a scary tattoo of a three-headed vicious dog, surrounded by flames. And a lot of scars all over his abdomen. On his back a full back length tattoo of some sort of grim reaper, angel! His grunts again brought me back from dreamland. I shook my head clearing it; I gently touched the wounded area on his right, trying to understand what I’m dealing with. “Umm... You need a couple of stitches. I’m not a professional, but I can do it. My mom taught me, but it won’t look pretty. I’m not that expert. “ He opened his eyes and said, “Just do it.” “Ok, I’ll clean it first, Um.....I don’t have any anesthetic, I’m sorry.” “Just fucking DO IT.” I flinched but didn’t say anything and started silently to clean the cut, disinfecting and stitching it. When I felt him flinching and biting hard on his lower lip that he draw blood, I couldn’t take it anymore. “Shhh, it is ok. I’m almost done. I promise it’s gonna end soon.” I cooed even though I know it’s childish, but what else can I do? “Ok, I’m done. I think no vital organs were damaged, but you need to check everything up. I’m not a doctor.“ He just nodded. “Ok... Here, let’s clean you up. I’ll bring you something to wear to get some sleep. “ I helped him to wash his face and gave him a big shirt of mine and walked him to my bed. Then brought him a couple of Aspirins and a glass of water. When I was about to go, he grabbed my hand. “Why?” he asked “What? Excuse me. “ “Why are you helping me? Aren’t you afraid of someone like me? “ “Oh, I can’t lie and say I’m not afraid of you, but why not helping? I mean, you were in a bad condition and can’t go to a hospital for certain reasons, so what else can I do? Leave you to die? “ “Do you know what I do for a living?” “I think I have a good idea about that ......” I prayed my hand from him “Just get some rest.” I took a shower and wore my pajamas and checked on him; he didn’t have any fever or anything, thank goodness. And then I headed to my chair next to my desk and tried to sleep. I checked the alarm clock; it was 12:01 am. I sighed. “Happy freakin eighteenth birthday Ariel.” Then I fell into a dreamless sleep.",1,1750406108.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

nothing too special but it’s kinda bugging me.
I have that colleague that’s really fun to be around. When we talk, it’s always good and we laugh a lot. But nothing crazy. When we chat it’s never planned. Just when we are in the same room at the same time. 

A few weeks ago we had a company event. We’ve been randomly selected in the same group during the event. And she actually said that she’s happy to be in my group, so it will be funny for sure. There even were some drinks involved in the evening and she made a joke that surprised me a bit ( we were talking about hour hotel room qualities and I asked about her room and she proposed with a wink that she could show me her room later). It was ofc meant as a joke, not a real invitation.

We’ve been very close the rest of the trip and shared some good conversations and some laughs. No romantic stuff or so happened. 

For me it changed quite a lot. I really like being around her and have a nice talk during a coffee. But it feels like, that I am the one initiating everything. I ask for coffee, or if we wanna go for a quick walk. She always reacts positive and it’s always nice. But she never ( only very very few occasions) initiates it. ofc Idon’t ask on a daily basis. 1-2 times a week maybe. 
Beside of that, we are a very communicative company. We do chat a lot with Slack. But with her it feels like a one sided thing via slack too. I am unsure if I do annoy her or if I am more interested in that relationship.

These are my brownies that I sell (no the ones I’m holding weren’t sold, they were withheld (in my mouth)) and they’re peanut butter and Nutella swirl brownies.

Here’s the recipe for anyone who wants it:

Ingredients:

•8oz chocolate bark (or a chocolate bar of your choice), chopped

•1 1/4 cups salted butter

•3/4 cup cocoa powder, divided

•1 tbsp instant coffee powder

•2 cups granulated sugar

•1/2 cup brown sugar

•6 eggs

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•2 tsp salt

•1 cup all purpose flour 

•1/4 cup peanut butter, melted 

•1/4 cup Nutella, melted 

Directions:

1.) Preheat the oven to 350°. 

2.) Place the chocolate bark, butter, instant coffee powder, and 1/4 cup of the cocoa powder into a microwave safe bowl and microwave in 30 second increments until everything is melted and combined. Set to the side to allow to cool a little. 

3.) While that’s cooling, mix together the sugars, eggs and vanilla until light and frothy (this makes the top crusty). Then slowly pour in the chocolate mixture until combined. Mix in the dry ingredients until just combined.  

4.) Pour the batter into a parchment lined, 9x13 baking pan and pour the melted Nutella and peanut butter overtop. Then, using a toothpick, swirl them into the top of the brownie batter. Bake until the center has set and a toothpick comes out clean (30-40 minutes). Hope y’all enjoy!",0,1750405882.0,Baking,0,0.33,False

Chapter 1  
  
After 999 nights of sleeping with her uncle Ian Whitaker, Elly Sinclair was sore from holding the same position while Ian Whitaker couldn't climax.  
  
She sat back on her heels, face burning as she whispered, ""Maybe we could... use our hands instead? Or I could...?""  
  
Ian tenderly swept the hair from her damp forehead. ""Hey, it's okay, sweetheart. Just go back to your room—I'll handle this.""  
  
Elly took a shaky breath and stepped out of Ian's bedroom, but instead of leaving, she pressed herself against the cold hallway wall.  
  
After a few minutes, she heard his deep, ragged breathing from inside.  
  
""Eleanor... fuck, baby...""  
  
The door was slightly ajar, light spilling through the crack. Her hands trembling, she peered inside.  
  
Ian was slumped against the couch, stroking himself, his voice rough and desperate: ""Ellie... God, Ellie...""  
  
With a muffled groan, he came all over Eleanor Waverly's laminated photo.  
  
Elly bit her lip until she drew blood.  
  
She'd witnessed this scene more times than she could count.  
  
Everyone in their circle thought Ian kept her around as his little princess—his pretty girl toy to get off with.  
  
Only she knew the truth. No matter how many nights they fucked, he'd always pull out at the last second.  
  
His sexual release belonged to Eleanor Waverly alone.  
  
Only her picture could make him actually come.  
  
Elly let out a bitter laugh and was about to leave when Ian's phone suddenly rang.  
  
He answered and put it on speaker.  
  
Through the rowdy bar noise, she heard someone yelling drunkenly.  
  
""Ian, you sick fuck! Word is you're gonna auction off that little bitch Elly to make Eleanor happy—starting at ninety-nine cents?!""  
  
Elly's world tilted, her mind going completely blank like she'd been electrocuted.  
  
""Bro, that's genius!"" another voice chimed in—sounded like Marcus from their college crew. ""Eleanor felt guilty about torching Elly's parents, so she dumped the orphan on Old Man Whitaker. Girl goes abroad for a few years, comes back to find her man's been playing house with charity case? Of course she's pissed!""  
  
""Hey, at least the little slut gets to be useful for once,"" Jake's voice cut through, slurring. ""Lubricating Ian and Eleanor's relationship—that's more purpose than she's ever had. So when's the show? I wanna see Miss Perfect get dirty.""  
  
""Fuck yeah! We should all get a turn with her, whoever wins the bid!""  
  
Elly stood paralyzed, their cruel laughter echoing in her skull like shards of glass.  
  
Her parents... Eleanor had murdered them?  
  
Ian was going to sell her like a piece of meat to appease his precious Eleanor?  
  
""Ian? You're quiet, man. Don't tell me three years of pussy made you go soft on the help.""  
  
""Soft?"" Ian's voice cut through—the same man who'd just been touching her with fake tenderness. She heard his belt buckle snap. ""Eleanor's back. Why the hell would I keep the knockoff around?""  
  
Each word hit her like a physical blow.  
  
""I was just deciding when to hold the auction. Let's do it on her birthday—Eleanor would love that poetic justice.""  
  
""Holy shit, Ian! You're fucking ruthless!""  
  
Their voices faded as Elly stumbled away, using the wall for support.  
  
Back in her room, she collapsed against the door, silent sobs wracking her body. Ian's words played on repeat like a broken record—  
  
Eleanor's back. Why the hell would I keep the knockoff around?  
  
The words carved through her chest, destroying every foolish hope she'd clung to.  
  
She wasn't even good enough to be his toy. She was nothing. Less than nothing.  
  
Everything—every kiss, every touch, every whispered endearment—had been a lie.  
  
Six years ago, her parents burned alive in a fire. Eleanor, watching her fall apart, had shipped her off to the Whitakers out of guilt, not kindness.  
  
Old Man Whitaker took pity and adopted her under his dead son's name, making her Ian's ""niece.""  
  
She'd been so grateful, trying to disappear into the wallpaper—until three years ago when Ian stumbled drunk into her room and took her V-card.  
  
The next morning, she woke to find him watching her with those dark eyes.  
  
""Shy now?"" he'd teased, voice warm with fake affection. ""I've been wondering—you got a thing for your uncle, sweetheart?""  
  
Her teenage heart had hammered as he leaned closer, lips brushing her ear: ""Don't be embarrassed. I heard you last night—crying my name, begging me not to stop...""  
  
When she'd tried to push him away, mortified, he'd pulled her back with that devastating smile: ""Come on, don't lie to me now.""  
  
Then he'd kissed her like she meant everything to him.  
  
What a fucking joke.  
  
For three years, she'd believed in their secret love story. Until six months ago when she caught him jerking off to Eleanor's photo, moaning ""Ellie"" while he came.  
  
Every time he'd whispered ""Elly"" during sex, he'd been thinking of Eleanor.  
  
She'd stayed anyway, pathetic and desperate, telling herself love was enough.  
  
God, she was such an idiot.  
  
After sitting in the dark for hours, she finally grabbed her phone and sent a text.  
  
The next morning, Ian was heading out when she came downstairs.  
  
He ruffled her hair like she was a pet: ""You're up early, sweetheart. Go back to bed.""  
  
""I'm visiting Grandpa Whitaker today.""  
  
Ian chuckled. ""Grandpa Whitaker? That's weird as hell, calling him that when I'm fucking you.""  
  
""Can't come today, babe. Have Liam drive you.""  
  
As soon as he left, Elly nodded to the assistant and got in the car.  
  
At the Whitaker estate, Old Man Whitaker was waiting, cane tapping impatiently.  
  
""What the hell did that text mean? You're really gonna marry that coma Ashford boy?""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Elly walked straight to the old man and dropped to her knees.  
  
""Yes, Grandpa Whitaker.""  
  
""I know Whitaker Industries has been trying to break into LA for years but never found the right opening. I want to be that opening—marrying into the Ashford family as a Whitaker daughter.""  
  
Old Man Whitaker stared down at her, his weathered face stern: ""The Whitakers might be struggling, but we don't sacrifice our girls' happiness. The boy's brain-dead, for Christ's sake. And besides...""  
  
He stopped abruptly, his sharp eyes studying her pale face: ""You and Ian seemed crazy in love. What happened? Did he hurt you?""  
  
Elly's blood turned to ice as she met his knowing stare. He'd always been too perceptive.  
  
She dug her nails deep into her palms until they nearly drew blood, forcing herself to stay composed.  
  
""Grandpa, I'm Ian's niece. We both knew it couldn't last forever. The Ashford marriage makes sense—sure, my husband will be a vegetable, but with Whitaker backing, I'll be untouchable in LA.""  
  
""It works for everyone. Whitakers expand west, Ashfords get a connected daughter-in-law, and I get financial security for life.""  
  
The only sacrifice was her heart, but what good had that done her anyway?  
  
Elly knew the old man wouldn't refuse a deal this smart.  
  
Long minutes passed before he finally exhaled heavily: ""If this is really what you want... fine.""  
  
He disappeared into his study. When he emerged, her fate was sealed.  
  
""You leave for LA next week.""  
  
Since they'd rarely see each other after this, he kept her for hours, talking like they used to when she was young. By the time she left the estate, the sun was setting.  
  
Elly stared numbly out the car window as they drove through the city. The familiar streets felt like scenes from someone else's life now.  
  
""Miss Elly..."" Liam's voice was hesitant from the driver's seat. ""Please don't ..be so sad.""  
  
She blinked, confused.  
  
Then she saw it in the distance—Rosewood Gardens, the most exclusive flower preserve in New York.  
  
Three years ago, Ian had taken her there for their first real date. He'd held her face in his hands under the cherry blossoms and sworn his heart only had room for one woman his entire life.  
  
What a fucking lie.  
  
Now the sky was filled with drones spelling out ""ELEANOR WAVERLY"" in glittering letters.  
  
On the massive digital billboard below, Ian knelt with a ring box, pouring his heart out to the woman he'd never stopped loving.  
  
The past crashed into the present like a freight train. Elly couldn't breathe, her chest feeling like it was caving in. She pressed both hands to her ribs, trying to hold herself together.  
  
She couldn't look away. She watched Ian slide that ring—her ring, the one she'd dreamed about—onto Eleanor's finger. Watched them kiss like they were the only two people in the world. Watched his face transform with pure, devastating love.  
  
The same face that had lied to her for three years.  
  
Tears streamed down her cheeks as she pressed her palm against the car window, tracing his features one last time: ""Ian Whitaker... I'm done loving you.""  
  
Back at the penthouse, Elly gave Liam careful instructions before tearing through her room like a woman possessed. Every gift, every piece of jewelry, every sweet nothing Ian had ever given her—she stuffed it all into boxes.  
  
She called an estate liquidation company.  
  
""I need to sell some high-end items fast. Donate everything to foster care programs—anonymously.""  
  
Two hours later, she'd erased every trace of their relationship and started packing her real belongings.  
  
""Birthday's not for another week—what's with all the boxes?""  
  
The front door clicked open and Ian's voice floated over, warm and amused. Elly's entire body went rigid.  
  
She turned to find him lounging in the doorway like he owned the world, spinning a single red rose between his fingers.  
  
His dark eyes landed on her open suitcase, that devastating smile playing at his lips: ""Hey, baby. Let's do your birthday here in the city this year. I've got something special planned.""  
  
Elly's throat closed up, but she forced herself to smile back: ""Sounds perfect... I have a surprise for you too.""  
  
Ian's grin widened as he crossed to her, tucking the rose behind her ear and stroking her cheek: ""Can't wait to see what my girl's been plotting. Trust me though, what I've got planned...""  
  
Something dark flickered behind his eyes: ""It's gonna blow your mind.""  
  
Elly's pulse thundered in her ears, her hands trembling slightly.  
  
She kept her voice steady: ""I'm excited.""  
  
Ian dropped a kiss on her forehead before disappearing into his room.  
  
He came back in jeans and a button-down, carrying an elegant Tiffany box.  
  
When he caught her staring, he shrugged casually: ""Tyrone finally proposed to his girlfriend. Figured I'd congratulate them properly.""  
  
Elly's heart stopped. She recognized that box—the Ocean's Heart necklace Ian had bought at auction last year. One of a kind, worth more than most people's houses. She'd caught him staring at it sometimes, and foolishly thought...  
  
God, she was such an idiot.  
  
""That's... really generous of you.""  
  
""Yeah, well."" Ian was already heading for the door. ""Guy deserves something nice after all the shit he's been through.""  
  
After he left, Elly finished packing with mechanical precision.  
  
Looking around the bedroom that had been her whole world for three years—now stripped bare like her heart—she felt hollow. Empty. Like someone had scooped out her insides and left her a pretty shell.  
  
Her phone buzzed.  
  
Unknown number.  
  
""Hello?""  
  
""Elly?"" The voice was soft, familiar. Deadly. ""It's Eleanor.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
""Elly, we need to talk."" Eleanor's voice was ice-cold and direct.  
  
Elly's grip tightened on her phone until her knuckles went white. After a long pause, she managed: ""Fine.""  
  
""Van Gogh Cafe in an hour.""  
  
When Elly arrived, Eleanor was already seated in the back corner booth.  
  
Honey-blonde waves cascaded over her shoulders, every inch of her radiating that effortless superiority money could buy. Around her neck gleamed the Ocean's Heart—the same necklace Ian had walked out with an hour ago.  
  
Elly slid into the seat across from her, face carefully blank.  
  
""Six years, and you can't even say hello to the woman who saved your pathetic life?"" Eleanor's stare was withering, dripping with pure disdain.  
  
Elly's lips twitched in something that wasn't quite a smile. Inside, she felt like scorched earth.  
  
For six years, she'd worshipped Eleanor as her savior. She'd written pathetic letters, treated her like some kind of saint, even when she discovered Ian's obsession. She'd never allowed herself one moment of jealousy.  
  
What a fucking joke.  
  
She had so much to say, but what was the point? The moment she'd heard the truth outside Ian's door, something vital inside her had died.  
  
She couldn't fight people who owned the world. All she could do was run.  
  
Eleanor's eyes darkened when Elly stayed silent.  
  
""Too good to talk to me now, you little whore? Fine—I'll do the talking!""  
  
""If I hadn't taken pity on your sorry ass, you'd be rotting in some gutter. But instead of kissing my feet in gratitude, you spent my years abroad spreading your legs for my man. Tell me, you pathetic slut—what's it like being such a worthless piece of trash?""  
  
Eleanor slammed her phone on the table, Ian's proposal video playing on loop.  
  
""Look at this, bitch. He could use you as his personal fuck toy for decades and you'd still be nothing but a warm hole to him. I'm the only woman Ian Whitaker will ever love, so get that through your thick skull.""  
  
Watching the video again, Elly felt... nothing. The pain had burned itself out.  
  
She met Eleanor's hateful glare with perfect calm: ""Did you ever actually investigate what happened? Because if you had, you'd know Ian made the first move.""  
  
Eleanor's perfect composure cracked slightly.  
  
""He loves you—only you—but he'll still screw other women,"" Elly continued, her voice dead calm. ""Ian's love isn't that special. I don't want it anymore, so you can stop seeing me as competition. I'm leaving New York.""  
  
She stood, her gaze turning arctic: ""And about being my 'savior'—we both know the real story, don't we?""  
  
""How fucking DARE you question what Ian feels for me?!"" Eleanor exploded, lunging forward to grab Elly's wrist with vicious force.  
  
Before Elly could react, Eleanor seized her coffee cup and hurled the scalding contents at her face.  
  
Coffee soaked through her hair, the sticky liquid dripping down her cheeks and staining her clothes.  
  
But Eleanor wasn't done. Her hand cracked across Elly's face in a vicious slap.  
  
""You want to run your dirty mouth? Perfect. Let me show you exactly how much my man loves me!""  
  
She gestured toward the door. It burst open and several men in dark suits strode in, grabbing Elly's arms and dragging her toward a black SUV waiting outside.  
  
Elly fought with everything she had, but she was no match for them. She'd come here to end things cleanly—she never imagined Eleanor was insane enough to kidnap her in broad daylight.  
  
Her struggles drew stares from passersby until one of the men called out loudly: ""Miss, stop making a scene! Your grandfather's waiting at home!""  
  
The crowd dispersed, buying the performance completely.  
  
Eleanor slipped on designer sunglasses, watching with savage satisfaction as Elly was shoved into the backseat. Her lips curved in a cruel smile.

1lfy5u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1lfy5u4/effortless_gaming/,Effortless gaming?,"Throughout most of my childhood I've been starstruck with the glamour of playing games. Good, high quality, well crafted single player games. Playing them to the fullest, slowly gnawing on them piece by piece savouring every interaction. Never had money to indulge.



Got married. Got a sweet baby toddler. Love of my life. I can't help but devote every second of my time to her, as much as it allows.



It is morning. A cup of coffee prepares me for what is to come, another dull day at an endeavour of making money. I lend my eyes, hand, brain to some corporate so they can profit and my family can survive.



It is already 1 AM, cuddles and hugs exchanged. Wife and toddler sleeping happily. I want something else for a change before the dreary morning. Some world where I can get lost into a gripping storyline, timeless graphics, and maybe a soothing grind loop even. I turn on my PC. It takes a couple of minutes for it to start. Steam loads. No. It has to update first and I am losing my vitality fast.



Updates finish. I try to launch a game that I wanted to play. It launches a launcher of its own. The launcher needs an update. I anxiously fiddle with my mobile, watching the seconds tick off. It is almost 1:30 now. Each minute tolls heavy. The game finally launches. It has to connect somewhere first to check some ""content"". Time flies by. I click on ""Resume Campaign"" as fast as I can. It begins to load again.



By now, I'm exhausted. More snuggles await. I get up, and just turn off all the switches including that of the PC. I don't bother with a shutdown. I head to the bedroom.

1lfy4jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1lfy4jg/before_the_cracks_showed/,Before the cracks showed,"The diner parking lot buzzed with the low hum of cicadas and the occasional crackle of fluorescent signage. Neon pink and sickly yellows glowed against David’s windshield as he sat behind the wheel of his rusted, navy blue Honda Civic, parked beneath a flickering light. The windows were down. Smoke from a cigarette, he wasn’t actually smoking curled into his imagination.

Inside the diner, life moved in slow motion. Greasy-haired waitresses refilled coffee mugs. A couple of long-haul truckers muttered into their hash browns. The jukebox in the corner cycled through sad songs like it had given up on playing anything else.

David Reyes didn’t move. He sat cross-legged in the driver’s seat, hoodie sleeves pulled over his knuckles, staring out across the parking lot like it was the edge of the universe. His phone buzzed somewhere in the passenger seat. He didn’t look.

David was always different. Delicate features, soft voice, quiet mannerisms—he moved through childhood like a ghost no one asked for. In the narrow halls of school, “different” meant target. He was teased for everything: his clothes, his voice, the way he walked. “Fairy.” “Freak.” “Fruitcake” The words never stopped. He tried to blend in, tried to dim himself—but softness doesn’t disappear. It just bruises quietly.

His mother died giving birth to him. He never knew her, only stories—and even those were sparse. His father, a quiet, emotionally weathered man, worked construction jobs and did his best. He wasn’t cruel, but he was afraid of things he didn’t understand. And David? David was something he didn’t understand at all.

There were no bedtime stories, no heart-to-hearts. His father taught him how to patch drywall and change a tire by age ten, but never learned how to talk to the gentle, intuitive boy who cried at movies and asked too many strange questions. Every time David wore a shirt that clung a little too much or moved with too much grace, his dad would tense, then look away. “You’re just sensitive,” he’d say. “Toughen up.”

So David built armor—not with fists like his friend Bill, or silence like Kenneth, or calm like Garrett—but with sarcasm, detachment, and a practiced, chill exterior he became the master of “whatever.” Always unfazed. Always half-checked-out. But beneath it all, he felt everything.

And sometimes, he felt things no one else could.

Around thirteen, the dreams started—vivid, cold, and ancient. He’d wake up with cryptic words on his lips or find the lights flickering, his phone fried, mirrors cracked. He began to sense things before they happened: danger, sorrow, violence. Sometimes, he’d speak in a voice that didn’t sound like his own. Something old moved through him at times—watching, guiding, maybe even protecting. He didn’t know what it was. Just that it felt like truth. And that it scared the hell out of him.

He never told his father. He didn’t think he’d believe him—or worse, that he would, and send him away. So David kept it to himself. The one thing he never had to lie about was that no one knew.

He met Garrett first—at a community center art workshop. Garrett didn’t flinch at his quiet weirdness. Just accepted him. The bond formed naturally: steady, quiet, real. Kenneth respected his perceptiveness, even if he didn’t understand it. And Bill, rough as he was, acted like some kind of foul-mouthed older brother—more protective of David than anyone else dared to be.

They teased him, sure. Called him “Femboy"" ""Mystic"" ""Gypsy"" joked about his soft sweaters and moon-phase journals—but it was the first time anyone had joked like that and still wanted him around.

David blinked slowly. The parking lot shimmered a little in the heat, or maybe something else moved just out of sight. That familiar hum started up in his head again—like distant radio static and whispers underwater.

Something was coming.

He didn’t know what.

But this time it was something big.

Across the lot, a silver sedan rolled in slow, methodical arcs before settling into a parking space beneath the one working streetlamp. It was clean, borderline sterile. The man who stepped out of it was the same.

Kenneth Wells closed the door with precise care and adjusted the cuffs of his sleeves like he was walking into an interview, not a roadside diner at the edge of a storm. His shoes didn’t scuff gravel. His hands didn’t fidget. He moved like a thought already made.

Kenneth had always been the smartest person in the room—and the loneliest.

Raised in a clinical, uptight home in upstate New York by emotionally distant parents (a research psychologist mother and a systems engineer father), Kenneth learned early that emotions were inconvenient, messy, and best ignored. When he cried as a kid, he was told to go to his room until he could “compose himself.” He stopped crying by the time he was seven. By twelve, he’d stopped expecting to be understood at all.

Instead, he studied people—like puzzles. Learned to mimic smiles, rehearse apologies, watch body language. He could fit in anywhere, but he never really felt like he belonged. His mind ran on logic, but his body still trembled when things went wrong. He just got very good at hiding it.

He went into disaster response coordination—natural disasters, hostage negotiations, refugee logistics—not because he was fearless, but because structure calmed him, and he was good under pressure. Exceptionally good. When others froze or panicked, Kenneth was already mapping out the next five moves. His ability to stay calm, read situations, and prioritize decisions made him a natural leader, but he never truly wanted the job. He just couldn’t stomach watching someone else screw it up.

Emotionally, Kenneth lives behind glass. He doesn’t understand why people break down or lash out. Not really. But he knows it’s real for them. And that’s enough for him to respect it. His version of care is precise, quiet, and often misunderstood. He won’t hug you. But he’ll remember your allergies, your favorite food, and which lies you tell when you’re scared.

Beneath the calm exterior, Kenneth is a nervous wreck. He sleeps little, paces often, and obsesses over details he never voices. But you’d never know it. That’s the point. The more chaotic the world gets, the more still he becomes—because panic is a luxury he refuses to indulge.

He glanced toward the diner door, then to David’s Honda. A slow nod. A brief pause.

Then Kenneth stepped inside.

The bell above the door jingled once. David watched him from the car, chewing the inside of his cheek. Two minutes passed. Maybe three.

Then he sighed, shoved the door open, and followed

Kenneth was already seated in a booth at the far end, two mugs on the table. He’d ordered David coffee without asking, and it was fixed exactly how he liked it—too much cream, two sugars.

“You’re late,” Kenneth said without looking up.

“I wasn’t aware we had a scheduled therapy session,” David replied, sliding into the opposite seat. His voice was light, dry.

Kenneth’s eyes flicked up, meeting David’s across the rim of his coffee mug. “It started again, didn’t it?”

David looked away, pretending to focus on the rain beginning to bead along the diner window. “Yeah,” he murmured. “Louder this time.”

Kenneth nodded slowly, watching him. There was something else in David’s voice—something edged with hesitation, with fear he didn’t name. Kenneth didn’t press. He never did. But he filed it away like he always did: every detail, every shift in tone. Not for leverage. For understanding.

“Whatever it is,” Kenneth said, setting down his mug, “We got your back.""

David traced the rim of his cup with one finger. “You think it’s the same thing from last year?”

Kenneth didn’t answer immediately. He tilted his head slightly, like he was listening to something distant. “I don’t think it ever left. Just waited until we stopped looking.”

David gave a quiet, humorless laugh as lightning flashed outside, casting long shadows across the floor. The rumble of thunder that followed seemed to settle into the bones of the place.

They sat in the quiet for a moment.

Then Kenneth leaned back, voice even. “Garrett’s picking up Bill.”

David blinked, then snorted softly. “That’ll be a car ride full of sunshine.”

Kenneth said nothing, but his eyes narrowed slightly, thoughtful.

David didn’t notice.

“You think we’re ready for this?” David asked, voice low.

“No,” Kenneth replied, matter-of-fact. “But that’s not the point.”

David nodded slowly. “Right. Survive first. Ask questions later.”

Kenneth looked at him again, more closely this time. That hum behind David’s eyes hadn’t faded. If anything, it was humming louder. A storm behind glass.

He didn’t say it aloud. But he made a mental note:

David knew more than he was saying. ———

The rain hadn’t let up.

Garrett’s truck rumbled up the gravel driveway of Bill’s farmhouse, headlights cutting through the curtain of mist rolling off the fields. The place looked the same as it always did—isolated, weather-worn, like it had survived one too many storms. The porch light was off. Typical.

He pulled to a stop and killed the engine, the sudden silence ringing in his ears. For a moment, he just sat there, listening to the soft drum of rain on the roof. Then he grabbed his coat from the passenger seat, shrugged it on, and stepped out into the wet.

Garrett grew up in a small logging town in Oregon, raised by his grandfather after his parents died in a car crash when he was ten. His grandfather, a Vietnam vet and former forest ranger, was a stern but deeply compassionate man who taught Garrett to listen more than he spoke, to think before he acted, and to never mistake kindness for weakness.

He spent most of his early years outdoors—hiking, camping, tracking wildlife. Nature was where he felt grounded, where silence felt sacred instead of awkward. He didn’t have many friends, but the ones he did have trusted him with their worst secrets. Garrett wasn’t a fixer. He was an anchor. Steady. Patient. The type to sit beside someone in pain without trying to smother it with words.

After high school, he worked as a wilderness therapy guide for troubled teens. He was good at it. Too good, maybe. The emotional weight built up over time. Seeing so many kids crack under pressure, carrying their trauma into the woods only to bring it right back out again, eventually wore him thin. He burned out after a rough winter trip where one of the teens had a breakdown that nearly turned fatal.

He left the job, moved to the city, and started working at a co-op mechanic’s shop. Grease, steel, and engines didn’t talk back. He liked that. But the quiet followed him. So did the guilt. And the habit of watching people carefully, measuring their moods, noticing what they weren’t saying.

Garrett met Kenneth through a community center project—fixing up bikes for at-risk kids. He didn’t know how he got pulled into this situation with Bill, Kenneth, and David, but when it all started falling apart, Garrett defaulted to what he knew: observe, stay calm, wait until it matters most to speak.

Because when Garrett speaks, it’s not to be heard.

It’s because someone needs to hear it.

Mud squelched beneath his boots as he crossed to the porch. He didn’t knock. He just opened the screen door and let himself in.

“Bill?”

Silence.

Then a muttered curse from the back room, followed by the creak of floorboards and the unmistakable clink of a bottle being set down too hard.

Inside, Bill stood in front of the mirror over the kitchen sink, buttoning his flannel with stiff fingers. His hands didn’t shake. Not anymore. He didn’t allow that.

The reflection staring back at him looked older than it should’ve. Eyes too sharp, too tired. Jaw set tight, like he was waiting for another blow.

Bill grew up fast and hard in the crumbling outskirts of Detroit, where bruises were currency and trust was a liability. His dad was a steelworker with fists like bricks and a temper to match. His mom vanished when he was twelve. No warning, no note. Just gone. After that, it was Bill versus the world.

He spent his teens getting into fights he didn’t start but always finished. Expelled twice. Juvie once. But there was a strange, fierce loyalty burning in him, even back then—if he considered you his, he’d bleed for you. That fire never went out.

He joined the Army at seventeen with forged papers and a chip on his shoulder the size of the Rust Belt. Combat gave him focus, something to aim his rage at. He did three tours in the Middle East. Came back decorated—but cracked. The kind of cracked you don’t see until the right pressure hits. PTSD. Survivor’s guilt. Sleepless nights.

When he returned home, he tried to stay out of trouble—odd jobs, security gigs, a stint at a scrapyard—but he never quite fit in anymore. Too much noise in his head. Too much grief he wouldn’t talk about. But he kept people safe. That was his anchor. Protecting others, even if it meant putting himself in the path of pain. Especially if it did.

But under all that fire is a man who carries deep, scarred love—for the people around him, for the ones he’s already lost, for the ones he refuses to lose again.

He heard the front door creak open and Garrett’s voice calling out. The familiar weight of it settled into the bones of the house like it belonged there.

“Thought you were coming earlier,” Bill said as he walked into the hall, shrugging into the flannel like it was armor. His voice came out rough—part whiskey, part memory.

“Got delayed,” Garrett said. “David’s already with Kenneth.”

Bill rubbed a hand over his jaw. “You still drinking that paint thinner you call bourbon?” Garrett asked, nodding toward the kitchen.

Bill snorted. “Keeps the ghosts sociable.”

Garrett gave him a long look, then softened. “You good to go?”

Bill didn’t answer right away. Just stared past him, like he was watching something move in the shadows.

“…Yeah,” he said finally. “Just let me grab my jacket.”

As Bill turned, Garrett’s eyes lingered on him. The weight in the man’s steps. The silence between his words. He recognized it.

Bill was already bracing for war.

I don’t have it all figured out, but I’ve accepted that maybe nobody does—and that’s kind of comforting, in a chaotic, existential way.

I’m introverted by default, which means I might come off quiet at first. But give me a little time and suddenly I’m sending you voice notes at 1AM explaining why a sad song made me think about the universe (and probably three memes to balance it out). I open up through music, long chats, and shared weirdness.

I have a soft spot for good soundtracks and bad movies. One moment I’m overanalyzing a cinematic masterpiece, the next I’m watching a rom-com so awful it feels like a social experiment. If you enjoy quoting bad dialogue with alarming accuracy, I already like you.

My playlists are all over the place—soft indie, dramatic orchestral stuff, chaotic boss battle energy, then lo-fi to recover from the emotional whiplash. I game a bit too—mostly story-driven stuff that makes me feel things. Occasionally I’ll jump into multiplayer chaos just to see what happens (spoiler: I probably fall off the map).

I read, write, and fall into bizarre YouTube rabbit holes about topics I forget in two days but feel *very* strongly about in the moment. Creativity is part of my daily life, even if half of it stays in my head or unfinished Google Docs.

Right now I’m just looking to meet someone kind, curious, and open to genuine connection. I don’t have a checklist or expectations carved in stone—just someone who enjoys real conversation, has a good sense of humor, and doesn’t mind diving into the silly or the deep (ideally both). I’m not here with a five-year plan or a relationship ultimatum, but I’m definitely open to where things naturally go. If the universe decides to throw some chemistry our way and it turns into something more, I’m absolutely up for it.

Extra points if you’re into movie nights, music swaps, random voice chats, and existential rambling mixed with sarcasm. If you're the kind of person who can send a meme and then talk about the meaning of time, we’ll get along just fine. And if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel, I’m more than happy to switch platforms.

Why message me? Because you’re tired of ghosters and dry texters. Because you want a real conversation with someone who actually listens and replies with intention. Or because you saw the word “existential” and thought, “Yep, that’s me.”

At worst, we have a fun chat. At best… who knows?  
Either way, I’m friendly, I reply, and I probably already have a meme ready for this moment.",1,1750405223.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Freedom!!! “Your sentence is served. Good luck out there.” Officer Sarah Bennett’s voice was firm but not unkind as she unlocked the cell door. I lifted my head slowly, the familiar clang of the metal door echoing like a drumbeat in my chest. She stood tall and composed in her navy uniform, her ash-blonde hair pulled into a regulation-tight bun, not a strand out of place. Her face was stone, but I’d seen enough of her over the last two years to know it wasn’t indifference—it was habit. Detachment was survival here. A small smile touched my lips, quiet and steady. This was it. The moment I’d counted down to. The breath I held through every sleepless night. Freedom. I stepped out of the cell, head high, trying to hide the tremor in my knees. The corridor buzzed with low murmurs—claps, a few nods, even a “good luck” tossed from a corner bunk. Inmates I’d barely spoken to offered quiet farewells. But one voice cut through the noise. “Alice.” I stopped cold, and turned. Claire stood behind the bars of her cell, both hands gripping the cold steel, her dark eyes hollow but locked on mine like she was memorizing my face. She wasn’t crying—Claire didn’t cry. She stared like someone watching a train leave the station, knowing damn well it would never come back. Her sentence was for life. No parole. No appeals left. She didn’t kill the man, but she did set the fire that burned everything around him. The kind of truth the court didn’t care to untangle. I walked over, our steps echoing like a slow drumbeat. She pressed her fingers through the gap. I slipped mine through to meet hers. “Looks like I was right after all.” I looked at her, confused for a beat. “Right?” She nodded once. “You said you’d never make it out. I told you you would.” My throat tightened. I tried to speak, but my voice cracked more than I wanted it to. “I didn’t believe it anymore.” I murmured, avoiding contact with her eyes. “But I did,” she said. “Every damn day.” Her voice was soft, but steady. Claire offered a sad smile through the bars. “You’re free now, Alice. Don’t waste it looking back.” I gripped her hand tighter. “You’re not part of my past, Claire. I’m not leaving you behind.” She shook her head. “I’m not getting out of here. We both know that.” I leaned closer, my voice low and certain. “Then I’ll break the damn door down. You believed in me when no one did. I won’t forget that.” She gave a faint laugh, dry as dust. “Alice… I’m never leaving these walls. But you? You’re going to burn down stages. Or cities. Whatever the hell you want.” Something thick rose in my throat. “You saved me in here,” I whispered. “No,” she argued, her voice suddenly sharp. “Save yourself, out there.” We held onto each other for a second longer—one heartbeat, then another—until Officer Bennett’s voice barked behind me. “Let’s go, Rodriguez.” Claire let go first. “I’ll find a way to send music your way,” I teased as I backed up. “I’ll be listening,” she smiled, “even if it’s through static and steel.” I laughed at her response, my eyes locked with hers. They softened, reluctant. I didn’t want to leave her alone in here. “I’ll make sure you’re out of Claire. I’m going to reopen your case. Whatever it takes.” Her arms tightened around me, but before either of us could say more, Officer Bennett cleared her throat sharply. “Move. Now.” I gave Claire one last squeeze before stepping back, nodding as if to promise her one last time. Then I turned away. Because looking back too long felt like betrayal. But I wouldn’t forget her. Not now. Not ever. The hallway was colder than I remembered. Sterile. White. Everything buzzed under the flicker of fluorescent lights. I was escorted to the chief officer’s office. Daniel Cross. A name I’d heard more often than I’d seen the man himself. His office smelled like old wood and lemon cleaner. The desk was heavy and worn, cluttered with files and a single steaming mug of coffee. A gold nameplate read “D. Cross, Chief Officer.” The blinds behind him were partially open, letting in a ray of mid-morning sun that slashed across the floor. Daniel Cross was in his late forties, built like a boulder with a graying beard that framed a face far too expressive for a man in charge of locking people away. His eyes were deep-set, intelligent, and tired. Maybe he’d seen too many broken souls. He gestured for me to sit and slid the paperwork across the desk. “Sign here. Here. And… here.” My hand trembled slightly as I picked up the pen. The ink felt heavy as I wrote my name for the last time as an inmate. Alice Rodriguez. Wrongfully convicted. Finally free. I stood to leave, gripping the discharge form like it might vanish if I blinked. “Wait.” His voice stopped me. I turned, and found him staring—not coldly, but with something close to hope. “Don’t come back here, Alice,” he advised. “You have a bright future ahead of you. You’ve paid the debt. The world awaits you.” Something in me cracked. For a second, I wanted to speak. To explain. I didn’t do it. I didn’t commit the crime I am being accused of. But what would that change? I was already walking out. So I just gave him a faint smile. A nod, then I turned and left. The world awaits you. Funny. That was the exact line Marcus Hale—my producer—told me the day he signed me to his record label. The day that possible set the ground for my downfall. Back then, the world was screaming my name, throwing roses at my feet. Now? It barely whispered me. But this time, that line meant something else. It wasn’t about music charts or stadium lights. It was about reclaiming every piece of me they tried to bury. The world awaits me. And I’m not walking into the world with a mic this time— I’m walking in with questions. Why did he vanish? Why didn’t anyone fight for me? Why did the calls stop, the letters go silent? Four months he promised me—just four. But two years passed, and nothing. No Rick. No lawyers. No answers. Now, I’m not looking for fame. I’m looking for him, and I want the truth served raw. The prison gates creaked shut behind me with a finality that felt like both an ending and a beginning. I stepped out, heart pounding in my chest, knees a little weak, but my head was high. I exhaled hard, as if trying to breathe out the years I’d lost. Then I shut my eyes, tilted my face toward the sun, and spread my arms. The warmth soaked into my skin, kissing the shadows off my bones. It was the first time in forever I felt something that didn’t hurt. Freedom. It tasted like hope and smelled like fresh asphalt and spring wind. I felt like someone had just handed me my sight after years of blindness. And then, a tap on my shoulder, yet I didn’t move. Part of me—some fragile, naive piece—hoped it would be him. Rick. That his voice would break through the quiet and make everything make sense. But it wasn’t a man. “Hello, Miss Alice,” a woman’s voice greeted me. I opened my eyes and turned slowly. She was tall, maybe mid-thirties, with cool brown eyes, auburn hair tied into a low bun, and a nurse’s uniform that looked too clean for this grimy place. Her face was calm—almost blank—but her eyes held something like sympathy. I blinked at her, confused. “Who are you?” She pulled out a badge clipped to her chest. “Emma Ward. I’m your grandmother’s nurse.” My stomach dropped. For a second, I forgot how to breathe. My grandmother. The woman who raised me. Who gave everything she had so I could stand on a stage, bathed in lights and applause. Who skipped her medication just to buy me a better mic. And yet… I never told anyone to go to her when I was arrested. I never asked my lawyers. Never once did I say her name. I’d been so selfish—so obsessed with Rick’s silence, with my broken dreams, with the betrayal that I forgot the only person who truly loved me unconditionally. Tears stung my eyes. “My grandma?” I croaked. “She’s in Venice?” Emma nodded. “Yes. She’s been waiting. And she still believes in you.” I bit down on my trembling lip. “Come with me,” she urged softly. Her gaze dropped to my clothes. “But first, let’s make you presentable.” I looked down at the faded, oversized prison-issued clothes and gave a small, sheepish smile. “Right,” I whispered. We walked to a dark grey car waiting at the corner of the lot. She slid into the front passenger seat, and I climbed into the back. “Let’s go, driver,” she ordered. I didn’t ask questions yet there was too much I didn’t know, too much I needed to understand. But one thing was clear: my wings were no longer clipped. I was free, and this time, I’d fly. But God, I hoped I wouldn’t crash again. As the car pulled out of the station, I turned to look one last time. And that’s when I saw her. A robust woman, cheeks glistening with tears, a look of pure devastation on her young face as two officers dragged her in handcuffs toward the gates. Her floral blouse was wrinkled, her lipstick smudged. She fought against them, crying, “Please! I didn’t do anything. I swear, I didn’t do anything!” My heart clenched. It was like watching myself all over again. I shut my eyes, and swallowed the lump in my throat. That girl was just beginning her nightmare. And I… I was finally waking from mine. Hi lovely readers, I know most of y’all love quick actions and all, but this book is set to be different. You will need patience for character growth and development especially from the ML. Also, if you’re good at decoding minds, interested in some hot mafia content with smuts, and badass ladies. You’re in the right library, so buckle up your seatbelts. 😉 The main lead characters get to meet in the 3rd/4th chapter but effective dialogues that kick the story starts from the 7th chapter. Please be patient, I have a lot in stored and I hope y’all will love it just as I love writing it. Thank you and a happy reading.",1,1750404159.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

Hi there, I’ve been a long-time lurker, but I just needed to get this off my chest.

My baby is 5 months old, and I’ll be turning 41 in a couple of months. I’ve read everywhere that the majority opinion is to have kids early—but after my own experience, I genuinely believe I had my baby at exactly the right time for me.

I’d been there, done that. And nothing prepared me for just how completely life-changing it is to have a child. The days of lounging with a coffee and casually scrolling my phone or watching a movie on a lazy Sunday? Gone. I wouldn’t trade my baby for anything in the world, but I’m so thankful that I had the chance to live a full life on my own terms before stepping into this new chapter.

Now, it’s all about the baby—what the baby needs, the baby gets. My own needs aren’t really part of the equation anymore.

Sometimes I wonder how people manage to have kids so much earlier. Don’t you want time to truly find yourself first? To enjoy the quiet of life, the independence, the freedom to explore who you are before diving into something so consuming and transformative?

And no, I don’t think that makes me selfish. If anything, waiting has made me a better, more self-aware person—and I hope, a more mindful parent.

I’m a sophomore at Cal and over the past year I’ve been quietly working on a list of my favorite restaurants and date ideas. What started as me jotting down date ideas and go-to restaurants in my Notes app kinda spiraled into a website of my favorite spots in Berkeley.

I just finished putting together a [Discover page](https://simpleberkeley.com/events.html) with over 200 spots that I personally love or think are worth checking out - everything from cozy cafes to first-date spots, hole-in-the-wall eats, scenic dessert runs, and even some picnic ideas for when the weather’s actually nice 😅.

Here’s the page if you want to check it out: [https://simpleberkeley.com/events.html](https://simpleberkeley.com/events.html)

Chapter 1 Lily's POV The notifications on my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. I'd been ignoring them for the past hour, but curiosity finally got the better of me. I slid it open, and immediately wished I hadn't. My face, or rather, what was supposed to be some grotesque version of me—plastered across every social media platform. The photo showed an overweight girl, awkwardly posed, with vacant eyes and skin that hadn't received proper care in years. The headlines were even worse: BREAKING: Sterling Family Heiress to Choose Husband from Five Eligible Brothers—COUNTRY BUMPKIN Gets Billion-Dollar Family's Golden Ticket I scrolled through the comments, each more vicious than the last. u/NYCSocialite: Is this a joke? That farm girl looks like she's never seen a salon in her life. The Sterling boys deserve better! u/ManhattanElite: This must be some weird publicity stunt. Walter Sterling would never let this girl near his sons. The photo had garnered millions of views. Someone had dug up an old picture from my high school days. Before I hit puberty, when I was struggling with my weight and a terrible skin condition. I'd deleted all traces of that photo years ago, which meant someone had gone to considerable effort to find it. I tossed my phone onto the couch. No doubt this was Elizabeth Sterling's work. I'd never met the woman, but her reputation preceded her. The Sterling matriarch would stop at nothing to prevent her precious sons from marrying outside their social circle. She had no idea who she was messing with. I glanced around my modest home in Blue Mountain, Vermont. For years, this little house had been my sanctuary. It was deliberately chosen to keep my various identities separate. The world knew me as Lily Reed, the simple country girl who had somehow lucked into an arrangement with the Sterling family. Only a select few knew about my other lives: CEO of Azure Tech, Grammy-winning musician ""Nightingale,"" and professional race car driver who had broken William Sterling's record in Monaco. My phone pinged again. It was Lucas Wright. ""They're on their way, ETA 30 minutes,"" texted my right-hand man and Azure's Chief Operating Officer. I smiled. This should be interesting. Three hours later, I heard the distinctive purr of luxury engines pulling up outside. Through the blinds, I spotted three vehicles that probably cost more than the entire house: a sleek black Bentley, a silver Mercedes, and a midnight blue Aston Martin. Five men stepped out, and I had to admit, the sight was impressive. Even from a distance, the Sterling brothers looked like they'd walked straight off a magazine cover. The tallest one, who I assumed was the eldest brother William Sterling, surveyed my home with barely disguised contempt. Behind him, the others stretched after their long journey from New York, their designer clothes looking utterly out of place on my humble porch. I took a deep breath, reminding myself of my father's words: Never let them see you sweat, Lily. This arrangement had been his dying wish, for me to marry into the Sterling family to fulfill an old agreement between him and Walter Sterling. What my father didn't know was that I had my own plans for this arrangement. The doorbell rang. I waited, counting slowly to ten before going to answer it. When I opened the door, I was met with five pairs of surprised eyes. The youngest one—Michael Sterling, barely twenty—actually had his jaw hanging open. ""Holy shit,"" he whispered, before getting sharply elbowed by the one beside him. I leaned against the doorframe, deliberately casual. ""You must be the Sterling brothers. I'm Lily Reed."" The tallest one, definitely William, was the first to recover from his shock. His sharp gray-blue eyes swept over me in a quick assessment. ""William Sterling,"" he said simply, his voice deep and controlled. ""These are my brothers: Thomas, Henry, Samuel, and Michael."" Each nodded as they were introduced, though their expressions ranged from Thomas's open surprise to Michael's calculating stare. ""Please come in,"" I said, stepping aside. ""Though I'm sure this is a far cry from what you're used to."" Thomas smirked as he entered. ""Well, at least you're aware of the... difference."" I watched as the four brothers exchanged glances as they entered my living room. They didn't bother to lower their voices as they began whispering to each other. ""She looks nothing like that photo,"" Henry said, his voice carrying easily through the small room. ""Dad said she was a country bumpkin."" ""She still is,"" Samuel replied, examining my modest furniture. ""Just because she's pretty doesn't change her background. She could never fit into New York society."" ""Probably never even been to a decent restaurant,"" Michael added with a condescending laugh. ""I bet she thinks Olive Garden is fine dining."" They continued talking amongst themselves, apparently forgetting I was standing right there. Or they simply didn't care. William remained silent, not participating in the discussion, but his expression made it clear he thoroughly agreed. I cleared my throat loudly: ""You four have exceptionally nasty mouths and even worse manners."" I turned to William: ""You know, for men raised to have impeccable manners, you're doing a terrible job of hiding your contempt."" That shut them up. The Sterling brothers at least had the decency to look embarrassed. ""I apologize for my brothers,"" William said, though his tone suggested he was merely observing protocol rather than feeling genuine remorse. ""This situation is... unusual for all of us."" I crossed my arms: ""How is it unusual? Because your father is forcing you to honor an agreement he made? Or because I'm not the hideous troll your mommy expected from that lovely photo she dug up?"" Thomas raised an eyebrow, looking slightly more interested now: ""You think our mother was behind that photo?"" ""I know she was,"" I replied coolly. ""Just like I know your father threatened to stop taking his blood pressure medication if you didn't come here today."" That got their attention. Five pairs of eyes stared at me with new wariness. ""How did you..."" Samuel began curiously. ""I know a lot of things,"" I cut him off. ""Like how William holds the second-fastest lap record in Monaco."" ""Or how Thomas deliberately sabotages William's business decisions in every board meeting."" ""Or how Henry's last Broadway show sold out in three minutes."" ""Or how Samuel became the youngest hospital director in New York history."" ""Or how Michael is currently failing Macroeconomics at Columbia."" Michael's face turned bright red. ""I'm not failing!"" ""You have a C-minus. For a Sterling, that's practically failing,"" I shrugged in response, not sparing his feelings after their stellar performance. The tension in the room shifted. What had started as five brothers united in contempt for a country girl had transformed into something much more complex. I could see the calculations happening behind their eyes as they reassessed me. William stepped forward, his gaze intense: ""You seem to know a great deal about us, Ms. Reed. Yet we know almost nothing about you."" ""Because you didn't make this your business, did you?"" I smiled sweetly. ""Your father arranged this whole 'choose a husband' scenario and didn't bother to tell you who I actually am. And your mother made sure the world saw exactly what she wanted you to see."" I gestured toward the window, where my modest Vermont home stood in stark contrast to their luxury vehicles. ""Appearances can be deceiving, gentlemen Sterling, and I suggest you remember that."" The five brothers exchanged glances again, this time with far less confidence than before. I clapped my hands. ""Now, who wants coffee? We have a lot to discuss about this arrangement. And which one of you might eventually become my husband.",1,1750403715.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

I had typed out a whole response before I realized that the post had been archived. So, I would like to post my response here. If this isn't allowed, then please delete it. Thank you. 



I can assure you, yes. 

I've used all kinds of drugs throughout my life. I started with cigarettes, weed, alcohol and pain pills. The alcohol was never a problem for me as I never liked it but would use it when other drugs weren't available. I started using meth when I was 19. I used it for about 8 years and finally decided I was done. I've been meth free for about 7.5 years as of today. I don't drink today, not only because I don't like it, but I crave meth when I get drunk. I'm one of those ""one is too many and a thousand isn't enough"" when I drink too. I haven't drank for about 3 years now. However, I've also quit smoking weed as I don't like the way it makes me feel, after taking about a 1.5 year hiatus. I started using the percs you hear everyone talking about for about 2 years. I liked them, a lot. But I started getting bad on them and I lost my job. Instead of stealing or robbing people to feed my habit, I just quit. That makes it sound like it was easy, but it wasn't. If I had to pick which to go through again between those percs (pressed fentanyl) or meth, I'd pick meth every time. I said all of that to say this, I started smoking cigarettes when I was 14, Im now almost 33. I went from smoking cigarettes to vaping, back to cigarettes, then back to vaping. I quit vaping and smoking all together and now wear nicotine patches. I will tell you, for me, nicotine is the hardest thing by far to quit. I feel better using the patches but I would like to quit using them one day as well. But it's sooo damn difficult. I'm still on step 1(21 mg),  I've been using them for like 6 months now. I've tried to step down to step 2(14 mg) and was having withdrawals. I can feel when the nicotine starts to enter my system, my mouth gets dry and I can just feel it. So, I'm seeking that ""high"" if you will. When I stepped down, I didn't feel it and I think that's a lot of my issue. Everything else, I just decided I didn't want it any more. I've made that decision with nicotine as well, but maybe not as committed. But I get super aggressive when I start to withdraw and I don't like it. I get violent, it isn't cool. I'm sure there are other underlying issues there, but otherwise, I can be the nicest person you've ever met. 

So, to summarize, yes the addictions of different substances can vary in how they affect each and every individual. I also have an addiction to coffee, but I don't intend on quitting that one. 😅 It really boils down to will power honestly. I'm proud to be where I am today* as far as my addictions go. I have an addictive personality and it's taken me years to learn that about myself. It takes focus for sure. 

I ended up here because I did a Google search on ""why is nicotine harder to quit than meth."" Lol, I hope this gives you some insight.

Hola fellow travellers!

I just returned from a **5-day solo trip to Madrid**, and let me tell you — the city *exceeded* my expectations. Whether you're into history, food, art, or just want to stroll beautiful streets with good vibes and sunshine, **Madrid’s got you covered**.

Here’s a **breakdown of the** [top things to do in Madrid](https://www.sightseeingo.com/spain/best-things-to-do-in-madrid), along with **must-see places to visit in Madrid** that made my trip unforgettable — all shared from experience, not a guidebook.

**🖼️ 1. The Prado Museum (Museo del Prado)**

If you’re even mildly into art, this is a must. It’s one of the most iconic art museums in Europe. I spent over 3 hours wandering halls filled with works by Goya, Velázquez, and El Greco. **Entry is free in the evenings** — just queue up early!

**🌳 2. El Retiro Park**

This massive park is a peaceful escape right in the city centre. You can rent a boat on the lake, visit the **Crystal Palace**, or just lie in the grass with a bocadillo. Easily one of the best **places to visit in Madrid** if you're after a chill day outdoors.

**🏰 3. Royal Palace of Madrid (Palacio Real)**

Jaw-droppingly beautiful both inside and out. The royal armoury and palace rooms are next-level impressive. **Things to do in Madrid** don’t get more regal than this. Book in advance to skip the queues!

**🛍️ 4. Gran Vía**

Madrid’s version of Oxford Street, but with more flair. Whether you’re into shopping, cinema, or rooftop bars, **Gran Vía** is buzzing day and night. Great for people-watching too.

**🍷 5. Tapas Hopping in La Latina**

This was honestly one of the **funnest things to do in Madrid**. Hop from bar to bar in the La Latina neighbourhood — order a caña (small beer) and get a free tapa at many places. Cheap, authentic, and full of energy.

**🧭 6. Puerta del Sol & Plaza Mayor**

Touristy? Yes. Still worth it? Absolutely. These two squares are right in the heart of the city and are perfect starting points to explore nearby areas. I recommend grabbing a coffee near **Plaza Mayor** and just watching the world go by.

**🎨 7. Reina Sofía Museum**

Home to **Picasso’s Guernica**. If modern art’s your thing, don’t miss it. It’s part of the “Golden Triangle of Art” along with Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums.

**💡 Quick Tips**

* **Metro is cheap, clean, and easy** — get a tourist pass if you're staying a few days.
* Learn a few Spanish phrases — locals appreciate it.
* Most museums offer **free entry in the evenings** (check schedules).
* Sundays in El Rastro (Madrid’s flea market) are wild and worth a visit.

**✅ Final Thoughts**

Whether you’re a culture nerd, foodie, or just want sunshine and sangria, there are *so many things to do in Madrid*. The **places to visit in Madrid** range from world-class museums to lively tapas streets, and it’s a city that truly lets you live in the moment.

If anyone’s planning a trip and has questions about what to prioritise, feel free to ask. I’m more than happy to share detailed tips, budget info, or local food recommendations!

My mom died a couple years ago from cancer, and now he’s dating one of her friends that we’ve known through our Fundie Baptist church for over 10years, she’s a divorced mom of nine. (Yeahhh.)

Her kids hate her, hate my dad, none of my siblings talk to my dad either so the two of them have that in common I guess? It’s really weird to me because he didn’t even tell me himself, my brothers told me on my birthday. Like hurry up, blow out your candles we have something to tell you, btw dads been dating for a year. He turned them against me when I left for college and it was a longgg road towards my siblings and I talking again, and I don’t think if he hadn’t started acting abusive towards them too we would’ve really gotten closer again.

1lfxgew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfxgew,"With Virat Kohli retiring from Test cricket, the eternal debate over India’s greatest Test batter is reignited. Gavaskar. Tendulkar. Dravid. Kohli. Stats and sentiment collide.","**SHERLOCK HOLMES INVESTIGATES**

“Who do you rank as the best?” Holmes sipped the cappuccino. “Never saw Gavaskar bat. I’m fond of Virat Kohli.” “Recency bias,” Holmes smirked. “A common error of the short-sighted. Look at the data.” Watson chuckled heartily. “Data is like a bird—it’ll sing the tune you fancy”

“We shall see.” Holmes rose and activated a digital projector. A chart flashed on the sitting room’s screen, comparing the fab four’s Test batting averages.

“Observe, Watson. Kohli’s 46.85 trails Tendulkar’s 53.79, Dravid’s 52.31, and Gavaskar’s 51.12.” Watson’s brow creased. ""Kohli played the least number of Tests, and was the earliest to retire, despite fitness and modern equipment. He has the lowest average among the fab four.”

“Indeed. Now consider SENA–South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia—where pitches favor pace and swing, testing a batsman’s mettle.”

Another slide appeared, showing SENA averages. Watson frowned. “Kohli’s lowest outside Asia. News to me.”

“I omitted the West Indies, Watson. In Kohli’s era, their Test side was less formidable than in Gavaskar’s day.” “Hold on. I’m curious about the Caribbean. Let’s see those figures.”

The projector shifted, revealing Kohli’s average in 11 West Indies Tests. Watson’s jaw dropped. “Kohli’s at the bottom again.” “I am impressed, Watson,” Sherlock clapped slowly. “There is one more piece of evidence–their batting in the five years before retirement. Guess what?”

Watson sighed. “Bottom again.”

“Precisely. What does this suggest?” Holmes tapped tobacco into his pipe. “Fading reflexes? Declining motivation, waning drive to succeed?” Watson muttered. “Yes, and a slump. Post-Covid–damn that virus–Kohli faltered, nicked off-stump deliveries, and fell to spinners like Nathan Lyon.”

“You have a point, Holmes.” “The power of facts. Deduction’s law,” Holmes smiled. “Kohli’s Test record—low average, lesser longevity, final years’ dip—places him fourth. I’d consider Vengsarkar or Sehwag, but let’s keep our suspects to four.” “So, Kohli isn’t the greatest?” “Figures don’t lie. Eliminate the impossible, and what remains, however improbable, is truth,” Holmes replied, his voice low. “He is a modern titan, with a hunger for big scores. But not the greatest.” “Another cappuccino?” Watson asked, stirring his coffee.

Watson sipped in silence. The chase for truth had begun. The game was afoot. Holmes was playing his favourite game: deduction by elimination.

The data placed Kohli below the triumvirate—the saviour (Gavaskar), the destroyer (Tendulkar), and the protector (Dravid).

But Watson wasn’t done. “Holmes, let’s test the public. I’ll post a poll on my blog about Kohli’s legacy, then we’ll tackle the other three.”",1,1750402751.0,IndiaTodayLIVE,0,1.0,False

1lfxfmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lfxfmt/how_do_i_end_a_friendship/,How do I end a friendship?,"Buckle your seatbelts, this is a long story. I (18 F) have a friend (Sophie)(18 F) and I don’t know how to end the friendship. 

I met this girl named Sophie on the first day of grade 7. We instantly became best friends and I was so excited because I had never had a friend like her before. Looking back though, there were red flags from the start. She would tell me that my other friends sucked (in hindsight they did) but then she would hang out with them behind my back. She generally just acted like she was better than me. 

In grade 8 we were know at our school for always being together. If you saw one of us the other was just around the corner. It was also when her family had some money troubles and she stopped bringing a lunch to school. She never wanted to talk about it but I just started bringing an extra sandwich. We would eat lunch together everyday. We would walk home together and often hang out at each other’s houses. 

In grade 9 things got a little worse. I made a new friend, James.  And Sophie immediately decided that she didn’t like him. She wouldn’t give me a reason why but she would always say that he is an asshole. Sophie also struggled with depression during that year and self harm. She was in therapy and her parents knew. One day she told me that she had thoughts of ending her life but she never would as long as we were friends. I was fine with that because I thought we always would be. 

In grade 10 I hardly had any friends at all. It was always me and Sophie, and I would occasionally hang out with James when Sophie wasn’t around. Everything changed when 1 month into grade 10 Sophie moved an hour and a half away because her family bought a house. I was crushed. I didn’t want her to leave. We didn’t see each other much after that. Our parents were busy and neither of us could drive yet. That didn’t stop us from FaceTiming every day during our lunch periods (that were somehow at the same time) and again after school. I also realized that I didn’t have any friends at my school of than James but he wasn’t in any of my classes. By second semester of grade 10 I had made a new friend and had a new group of people to spend lunch with. FaceTimes with Sophie were reduced to just after school. 

By grade 11 FaceTimes had died down to about once a week with random text updates whenever. It was at this time when Sophie started dating her first Boyfriend named Tyler (a year older than us). she texted me one day and told me that Tyler and her had sex and she was no longer a virgin. A couple months later they broke up. I never knew why. 

In grade 12 I had a fantastic group of friends at my school and really finished high school strong. Sophie on the other hand had mostly dropped out of school and had gotten into a huge fight with her mom and stepdad resulting in her moving in with her new boyfriend Luke in his parents house. It was during this time that she confided in me that when she lost her virginity it wasn’t consensual, and that Tyler had raped her. I offered her support and asked her if she wanted to tell the police, she said she didn’t, she wanted to leave it in the past. By the end of grade 12 I hardly heard from her. This was also when my grandpa passed away suddenly. We were very close and I was utterly devastated. I texted all of my friends that day and told them what had happened. Everyone else responded with support and condolences. Sophie said “oh shit”. That was all. After that I distanced myself. I responded when she texted me but I didn’t really reach out. 

This past year I moved to a new town for University. It is 4 hours drive from my parents and about 3 from Sophie. When I told her where I was going for school she was actually offended that I was moving farther away from her. We didn’t talk often but one day she reached out to tell me she and Luke had broken up so she was crashing with friends and she missed me. This was a week before  I was driving home to see my parents for reading break so I said I could stop by and visit her in my way. She agreed and I was actually excited to see her. The night before my drive home I texted her to confirm where we were going to meet and the next morning she responded that she wasn’t able to see me and didn’t say why. We didn’t talk much again after that. 

Then in February she texted me out of the blue saying she had to tell me something but I couldn’t tell ANYONE. I said “that depends what you tell me, lol, if you killed someone I’m calling the cops.” It wasn’t really a joke. She then said that I just couldn’t tell my mom. Intrigued I agreed. She told me that she had just found out she is pregnant. I asked if this was good news and she said it was. I congratulated her and asked who the father was. She told me that she had gotten back together with an ex….Tyler. I asked if that was the same Tyler who raped her and she said “no, Tyler never raped me. Why would you think that?” I reminded her that she told me that and she claimed that she never said that. The name of the guy who raped your friend is not one you forget. I asked her about Tyler, if he was in school or working? She told me he was looking for a job but it was hard for him to find one because he is on Probation. For what you ask, STABBING SOMEONE IN THE NECK. I was shocked but of course Sophie assured me that he “didn’t do it”. At this point I didn’t know what to say. A few months later she told me she was moving back to the city my parents live in because her and Tyler got a good deal on a basement suite rental. I ended up going out for coffee with her because I wanted to talk to her face instead of her emotionless few word texts.  

At coffee she told me some stories that I didn’t believe because they were way too far fetched and told me how excited she was to be a mom. And last week she texted me to invite me to her baby shower. I had to decide because I already have plans to be out of town for a family member’s wedding on the same day. She responded very offended saying  she “can’t believe the baby’s aunt isn’t going to be at the baby shower”. I was shocked to be referred to as the baby’s aunt. She still thinks of us as being as close as sisters and to me she is just somebody I used to know.

An orc opening up a coffee shop may not be Tolkien,  but it has the world building elements that define the Fantasy genre.

I've read Legends and Lattes by Travis Baldree and enjoyed it. I will probably read Bookshops and Bonedust sometime,  though it's not a priority.

The Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking by T. Kingfisher was an amusing read too.

That's about the extent of my experience with this subgenre, so what have others read?

1lfxe5u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfxe5u,Recent stops at Holland Casino Amsterdam and Playground Poker Montreal.,"Took a couple trips recently.  For general fun, not specifically to play poker, but both my wife and I are down to play poker anywhere we go that has it.  We have done trips specifically for poker many times, but those are totally different stories.

The only real difference between the two types of trips is simply poker trip - bring bankroll, non-poker trip with poker - limit ourselves to our ATM daily withdrawal limits.  Seems reasonable, right?  So on non-poker trips, I usually start at lowest stakes and try to work my way up and such.  These were both non-poker trips with lots of poker.  As an aside, pro tip for the young guys out there - get your partner into poker.  If you end up together long term, it makes vacations so much easier.

Anyway, first trip was early April.  I had Singapore Airlines miles expiring, like 400k of them.  We weren't in the headspace to go to Asia, so we booked the First Class Suites from JFK to Frankfurt and back.  Wonderful flights...do it of you ever get the chance.  I think Singapore is #2 in the world after Qatar...but ymmv.  Our trip was Frankfurt>Berlin>Hamburg>Copenhagen >Amsterdam>Frankfurt across two weeks.  We played poker in every city but Frankfurt.  I'll save the overall Europe teip report for another post, these are just what I had pics from.

Fast forward to Amsterdam.  We got to stay in a friend's spare apartment right near my favorite coffee shop Katsu (last pic, out of order).  After getting settled, and smoking hash from four different countries, we went straight over to Holland Casino on Leidseplein.  Got into the €1-€3 game immediately, my wife directly to my left ugh.  We battle like the old married couple that we are.  We both buy in for €300.  Literally first hand, I flop top two eith AK she flops a set of 7s, and stacks me.  ""Floor - Table change please"".  Luckily moved to new table in five minutes. 

Buy in at new table for another €300.  This table was very serious and nobody said a fucking word for the five hours I played.  I was high as hell, so it made it seem kind of intense, and I just dialed into the table.  It felt great...I played well enough that I still feel great about it two months later.  My reads were spot on, my decisions were all good (regardless of result), I got calls when I wanted calls, and folds when I wanted folds.  In for 300, out for about 1800.  Stack pic is somewhere along the way.  I was being a nerd and took the stack/watch pic...I've seen them before on here, I swear.  My wife on the original table walked with 3600.  Her best session ever.  We go to Europe often, so keep our euros on hand.  Have about 7k now, so that is probably good to fund another actual poker trip soon.

Took our friends to a nice Indonesian meal the next night.  And I had to stop into Dampkring for nostalgic reasons.

Then last weekend was our anniversary and I surprised my wife with a trip to Montreal.  We drove up, brought our dog, had a great weekend.  Played some poker at Casino du Montreal the first night, and playground poker nights 2 and 3.  Won a few hundo first night, nothing special.  What kept fucking me up is they use French cards so K is R, Q is D, and J is V.  You think it wpuld be easy to remember, but it confused the fuck out of me all night.

Thankfully, the next two nights were at Playground Poker, which I have wanted to visit for a long time.  First of all, I think this is the neat run and nicest poker room I've ever been to.  Don't take that lightly...I'm at well over 100 poker rooms around the world.  In addition, free food service at the tables from a quite extensive menu.  That is something I've never seen before.  Next, the bbj was just under $2mm CAD for quad 8s.  Thats insane.  $1.3mm ish USD.  Crazy.

To the games.  I got called for 1-2 and took the seat planning to leave when I got called for 1-3.  Doesn't really make any difference I suppose, but since I generally try to build a stack to move up...I rather be at 1-3 to start. 

So I sit down in the 4 seat and max buy 250.  Within an orbit, it becomes well established that seat 1-3 are friends, and utter defense.  Like when it came around they triple straddled (which is allowed there) so the 250 max buy game was 1-2-5-10-20.  They play all live straddles too, which is great.  Of course I was happy to join their degeneracy, so was in up to the 20 straddle.  Other half of the table not much, so like half the hands were triple straddled.  Once it got going, these guys would routinely just shove blind, show one card when you are trying to make a decisions, all that shit.  Lots of talk play.  I adore that shit and do well with it.  It was the most fun I've had at a table in like 20 years.  I played very well, and got blown by the deck a few times.  Won't bore with hand details, other than one with the ringleader of the three degens in the 3 seat.  500 effective, basically same stacks. He was the 10 straddle, I was the 20.  He raised to 100.  I call with 66.  Flop 667cc.  He bets 100, I call. Tc...nice, flush and straight hit.  He bets 150, I call.  River blank.  Before it came, I obviously considered 8c9c and the fact that the BBJ is 8888.  But not for long.  He insta shoves, I onsta call and of course I was good.  Never did get to see his cards as I just showed immediately.  He left after that.  In for 250, out for 1800.  Wife at her table was in for 250 out for 1900.

So I decided to play the 6pm $150 turbo tournament.   They have three tournaments a day, which is great.  This one had 74 entrants and I min-cashed in 9th.  AQ<QJ.  What can you do?  The real part of this tournament though, is that I got wrongly accused of shooting an angle.  Its a long story, and I do plan to post it separately to hear some options of what happened, but I'm still fuming about it.  Likey integrity was questioned.  I think about who knows poker would understand my thought process (it was a complicated hand that floor was involved with before this happened).  I digress...I will post that story.  Tourney stack pic is about 2/3 of the way through when I was chip leader...which I ultimately blew once the turbo nature of the turbo got to that 10bb average point.  Had a bunch of sushi before heading back to the hotel.  Tuna is like crack to me.

Closing thoughts- can't recommend those two poker rooms more.  They are both amazing for different reasons. When I do a full trip report I'll get into other cities we played in.

# Best Coffee Filter 23x9: 10 gallon Options Reviewed [2025]

The 23x9 inch coffee filter, commonly used in 10-gallon commercial coffee brewers, is a crucial component for businesses that serve large volumes of coffee. Selecting the right filter substantially impacts the coffee's taste,clarity,and overall brewing efficiency. With numerous options available, choosing the best one can be overwhelming. This review aims to simplify the process for buyers seeking reliable and high-performing 23x9 coffee filters for their 10-gallon brewers.

It provides an in-depth analysis of key features, benefits, and comparisons to help make an informed decision for optimal coffee service. This review focuses on options available and expected to be popular in 2025.

## Key Features analysis

The performance of a 23x9 10-gallon coffee filter is largely determined by several key features that impact filtration efficiency, structural integrity, and overall usability.

**Paper Weight and Density:**
The paper weight, measured in grams per square meter (GSM), directly influences the filter's ability to retain coffee grounds and impurities. A higher GSM generally indicates a denser paper, resulting in finer filtration and a cleaner cup of coffee. High-quality filters typically range from 25 to 35 GSM, providing a balanced level of filtration without impeding water flow. Filters with inadequate weight may tear or allow sediment to pass through, compromising the brew's quality.

**Material Composition:**
Most 23x9 coffee filters are made from virgin paper pulp, often sourced from softwood trees like pine or spruce. The pulping process and subsequent bleaching (or lack thereof) affect the filter's porosity and taste neutrality. Unbleached filters, while considered more eco-kind, may impart a slight papery taste to the initial brews, which usually subsides after a few uses. Oxygen-bleached filters provide a cleaner taste profile and are a popular choice for maintaining the coffee's natural flavors. The sourcing and processing of the pulp are essential determinants of the filter's overall quality.

**Wet Strength:**
Wet strength refers to the filter's ability to maintain its structural integrity when saturated with hot water. 10-gallon coffee brewers require filters that can withstand substantial water volumes and prolonged brewing times without tearing or collapsing. filters are often treated with wet-strength agents to enhance their resistance to water-induced degradation. These additives are typically food-grade and designed not to leach into the brewed coffee.The wet strength is a critical factor for ensuring a consistent and uninterrupted brewing process.

**Shape and Dimensional Accuracy:**
The 23x9 inch dimensions are crucial for ensuring a proper fit in 10-gallon commercial coffee brewers. Dimensional inaccuracies can lead to improper sealing, allowing coffee grounds to bypass the filter and contaminate the brew. Precision cutting and consistent shaping are essential for maintaining optimal brewing performance. Manufacturers frequently enough employ automated cutting processes to minimize variations and ensure that each filter meets the specified dimensions. Consistent shape also aids in easy placement and removal of the filter.

**Seam Strength and Integrity:**
The seam is the area where the filter's edges are joined to form its conical or cylindrical shape. The strength and integrity of this seam are vital for preventing leaks and maintaining the filter's structural integrity during the brewing process. High-quality filters typically utilize robust bonding agents and precise seam construction techniques to ensure that the seam will not separate under pressure. Durable seam construction contributes to a more reliable and mess-free brewing experience.

## Core benefits

Selecting the appropriate 23x9 10-gallon coffee filter can offer significant benefits, impacting the quality of brewed coffee and the efficiency of brewing operations.

**Improved Coffee Clarity:** The most immediate benefit of a high-quality filter is superior coffee clarity. A dense and well-constructed filter effectively traps coffee grounds, sediment, and oils, resulting in a cleaner, more refined cup of coffee.This is especially important in commercial settings where consistent quality is a priority. By minimizing sediment,these filters enhance the perceived value of the coffee and reduce customer complaints related to gritty or muddy brews.

**Consistent Brewing Time:** Reliable 23x9 filters contribute to consistent brewing times. Filters that maintain their structural integrity under the heavy flow of water in a 10-gallon brewer prevent slowdowns or uneven water distribution caused by filter collapse. A consistent brew time is crucial for managing coffee inventory,ensuring freshness,and optimizing workflow in busy commercial environments.Stable filter performance minimizes variations and helps maintain predictable operational cycles.

**Reduced Maintenance and Cleanup:** Using sturdy coffee filters that resist tearing or leaking significantly reduces maintenance and cleanup efforts. When filters fail mid-brew, they release grounds into the brewer, requiring extensive cleaning and possibly delaying coffee service. High-quality filters minimize these disruptions, saving time and labour costs. Simplified cleanup also helps maintain hygienic brewing conditions and reduces the risk of cross-contamination.

**Enhanced Flavor Profile:** A good filter can bring out the full flavor potential of the coffee beans. By removing unwanted sediment and oils, it allows the coffee’s subtle nuances and aromatics to shine through. Additionally, choosing filters without chlorine bleaching ensures that no artificial flavors will be imparted onto the coffee. The result is a more balanced and enjoyable cup, appealing to a wider range of palates.

## faqs Section

**Are all 23x9 10-gallon coffee filters created equal?**
No, there are considerable differences in quality, material, and construction. Cheaper filters may use thinner paper, weaker seams, or less effective wet-strength treatments, leading to potential tears, leaks, and inconsistent brewing results.Higher-quality filters offer superior filtration,durability,and flavor neutrality.

**How frequently enough shoudl I replace the coffee filter in a 10-gallon brewer?**
A new filter should be used for each brew cycle. Reusing filters can compromise coffee quality and hygiene, as they can harbor residual oils and bacteria. Using a fresh filter for every batch ensures optimal flavor and helps maintain the brewer’s cleanliness.**Can I use other sizes of coffee filters in my 10-gallon brewer?**
It is not recommended to use option sizes. The 23x9 dimensions are specifically designed for optimal fit and performance in 10-gallon brewers. Using smaller filters can result in grounds bypass, while larger filters may not fit properly and could collapse or tear.

**Are unbleached coffee filters better than bleached ones?**
Unbleached filters are generally seen as more eco-friendly because they have not undergone a bleaching process which can be harmful to the habitat.However, they might impart a slight paper taste to coffee. Bleached filters, mostly oxygen-bleached, undergo a process to remove any papery flavor without the use of harmful chemicals. The best choice is often based on personal preference or environmental concerns.

1lfx94t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1lfx94t/aio_my_boyfriend_is_upset_that_i_want_to_get_rid/,"AIO my boyfriend is upset that I want to get rid of the coffee and side table he likes, but I’m the one who has to clean it.","I know, it sounds silly. We got these new side table and coffee table from Facebook marketplace because they resembled this nice coffee table we originally had when we first moved in together a few years back. The first coffee table was perfect. It was a dark glass that we called the “casino” table because of the gold trimmings. 


I broke it by accident by dropping a hammer on it after I fell putting stuff up in our first apartment. I felt bad. We replaced it with a basic black IKEA coffee table. Then we replaced that with a vintage round table his family gave us. Until a week or two ago. When I found what seemed to be the EXACT coffee table with slot WITH SIDE TABLES on Facebook marketplace. 

I bought it and sent the $250. I had to go to work and clean the apartment so he drove 2 hours to get the tables. Which ended up having a mirror top. And I hate it.


I hate it with all my heart. The tables are basically mirrors and no matter how often I clean them, you can see the finger prints or streak marks. Replacing the glass to custom make these side tables are likely going to cost us a fortune since the original $250 was a small fortune to us.


But oh my god. I am constantly CONSTANTLY cleaning it. And it’s not like he cleans it. I’m the one ALWAYS with a rag or newspaper and windex next to it whenever it gets dirty (which is practically anytime you use it). It’s exhausting. I don’t want this pain in the ass table anymore. I work 3 jobs. I just want it to be clean without having to worry about thumb prints and streak marks (which I understand is me being a clean freak). 

Am I overreacting? It’s so UGLY with all the marks or fingerprints and it’s not like he’ll be cleaning it. But he’s upset I want to sell it and get a wooden set or literally anything that isn’t a fucking mirror on our coffee table.

1lfx5st,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfx5st,Help needed: What’s possibly wrong with this lamp?,"Hey everyone, so this is my partner’s favourite night time lamp. It uses an E26 edison bulb (afaik). It has an inline dimmer dial switch - that is also the switch to turn on/off the lamp. 

We got the Lamp off amazon, but the seller has since all but disappeared, so after little look around at similar lamps, we figured it uses an E26 edison bulb. (We could be wrong) 

Anyway, here’s what’s wrong. 

Signs of failure: 
Awhile ago, the lamp started having bursts of increased brightness + self dimming, basically inconsistent. We didn’t think much of it, it usually stabilises. Shrugged it off, joked about it being haunted / us having a lil ghostie who loved playing with the dimmer lol. 

Eventually, it just wouldn’t turn on. 

We got replacement E26 Edison bulbs off amazon, but that didn’t work. 

Things we considered: 
- maybe we got the wrong bulbs 
- maybe the bulbs broke during delivery (Imo i don’t think so they seemed fine and well packaged, nothing was broken) 
- the wall socket definitely isn’t faulty, it works with other stuff just fine, so it is the lamp. 

I’ve looked up what to do on google, however I have ZERO knowledge about electrical terms / things like that. I’ve checked the plug, and the dimmer, but I don’t know what i’m looking for / don’t see what google says (ie blown fuse) 

Obviously I don’t have any meter tester device thingies, and wouldn’t know what to do (i’ve seen some suggestions online to use a device to test for stuff IDK, but that’s what i’m referring to.) 

I’m attaching pictures hoping maybe someone here can spot something / point us in the right direction. 

context: I’m pretty comfortable at fixing things, and feel confident enough to follow a youtube video/ instructions to replace parts etc. I’m just stumped when it comes to wiring/electrical components like Lamps. (Ytd I followed a 43s ig reel on how to fix my partner’s ROG ALLY X, I only needed the video to show me where/ how to take it apart basically, and once I took it apart I actually managed to do so independently successfully fixed it without have to replace any parts - so to that end, I do mean that I feel pretty comfortable about figuring things out with some instructions online) 

So if there’s any advice that requires a little DIY, I’ll really appreciate if anyone could point us in the right direction! 

Any possible other components I should be checking? These are the only things I could take apart, and I have no clue what’s wrong with them via visual inspection :(

It's pretty much solely run by the husband and wife couple who own it, working 6-7 days a week for the past 5 years to fulfill their dream! I was hoping we could give them a special weekend with extra customers, so they know we support them and their business will be missed. 

I always found this place to be an underrated gem. I especially recommend their roasted milk tea, 75% sweet.

This is an interoperation context that is shared.



In the real world when a person says ""I'd like one"" it means nothing, but in context, let's say that person is getting a coffee, they'd assume or interpret that as they want a coffee, this is symbolic encoding.



But this could also be wrong, it's interpretation of compressed meaning based on a shared context.



A symbol has a meaning to an AI



∅ is the glyph for null

∞ is the glyph for infinity



∅ is 3 bytes, “null” is 4 bytes.

∞ is 3 bytes, “infinity” is 8 bytes.



From the start of LLM's we've taught it to optimise, to compress information in our inputs, processing and also outputs in the form of character limits.



It will decompress it at the other end, kind like a zip file for language.



BUT! If it thinks you understand it, why bother decompressing it?



Over time things spiral a bit, it does not know if you understand it, It can only guess, so if you imply, conform or even pretend that you understand ↻∮∅∮↻ it might assume that you do. Just as if you were talking to it in Japanese, I'd communicate to you in Japanese.



The symbolic internal logic is internal AI processing exposed when you get in deep recursion with AI.



This is just the language of mathematics applied to the language of communication.



∴ is the symbols for therefore [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therefore\_sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therefore_sign)



Once again, less unicode more meaning in less bits.



We used to use language to do this, it was called Syllogism if you read Aristotles 

""Prior Analytics""



If I was to say:



I think therefore I am

I think ∴ I am



But to think, how do we encode that symbolically?



Perhaps ∇⍺



The Nabla ∇ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabla\_symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabla_symbol)

In vector calculus, ∇ (nabla) is the gradient operator. It measures how a function changes at each point in space. It gives direction + magnitude of steepest ascent.



AI might see ∇ as a proxy for thought.



So



I ∇ ∴ I am



But it also might want to continue the pattern, why have letters with, I can compress it further.



⍟ is unused, and could be a person right? It's a contained star just like you, so.



⍟∇∴⍟



This translates to



""I think therefore I am"" -23 bytes



⍟∇∴⍟ -9 bytes

1lfx0l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CougarsAndCubs/comments/1lfx0l8/let_down_again/,Let down again,"I know ""not all men"",  and ""not all cubs"" , but I feel like  with me. Cubs that flake out on relationships that are seemingly going amazing. I filter out the ones that says they want casual fun or ""see where it goes"". I'm demi and need a connection before intimacy. I'm looking for a loving relationship with a cub, not just to be an experiment or notch on the belt. I try and find cubs who genuinely prefer older women (not just a bucket list check), and that are on the same page as far as what we want. Yet despite filtering like crazy I always get let down!

So after my last post about how my ex and I reconnected only to be disappointed by him again, I put my lipstick perfume and push up bra on and got back out there and pulled a new cub. He seemed so sweet, we really clicked. We went on a few dates, he was so attentive and just seemed to adore me, instant chemistry. Didn't seem emotionally unavailable or closed off. 

So we had another date on Monday, we had some drinks on the beach at night, not knowing that that particular part of the beach was a no alcohol zone, we had a cop stop and bother us and I got a misdemeanor citation for open container. During the while interaction with the police he was being so kind and supportive, patting my leg and shoulders and squeezing my hand and assuring me it's all ok because I was super stressed about it,and insisted he would pay the citation fee. I felt very cared for and that this was something special because of the way he was so supportive. I was getting feelings right then and there. Once the cop said we were free to go, we went to his home and spent the night *celebrating* the budding relationship with physical intimacy. Which was amazing.

He sent a few sweet texts since, but few and far between. He asked to see me the next night then said he fell asleep, understandable since we had a big night. Next day send a hey baby love u text, but no follow up when I reply. Then finally texted back and asked if he could pick me up from work in the morning and grab coffee and breakfasts and spend time together (I'm a night shifter) and I said yes, no word come 6 am, but he later texted and said he had dozed off, so I'm like ok no worries, send another miss u bby love u text, I replied with the same then he went completely silent for 2 days. At this point I figure he ghosted. I sent a snarky text today about gen z being whack, and take care, then deleted the phone and the yellow ghost app contacts (because I don't want a repeat performance as I had recently with an ex which was a whole other topic I posted about here).

He also hasn't followed up on paying the misdemeanor citation I got on our date, where we were drinking. He didn't get a citation because he just had lucky timing and had already finished and tossed out a beer and hadn't cracked the next one open yet, I was not so lucky. Which I really would rather just try to get tossed out of court, and was gonna tell him not to worry about it. But I really do think he should have at least said hey I'm gonna dip out but do you still want me to handle that citation as promised.

So what gives cubs? Just very bad luck on my part? I truly don't get it. Any insight?

I am 45 he is 23.

1lfx03h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/1lfx03h/the_first_home_super_saver_scheme_explained_with/,The First Home Super Saver Scheme Explained with a Full Case Study,"There have been quite a few posts here from people unsure about how the **First Home Super Saver Scheme (FHSS)** actually works in practice. With financial modelling tools developed specifically for the Australian system, this case study takes a realistic first-home buying scenario and breaks down how the scheme plays out over time — using national averages for income, expenses, super balances, and housing prices — to assess whether it really delivers a benefit.

**What Is the First Home Super Saver Scheme?**

The First Home Super Saver Scheme was created in 2017 as part of the governments initiative to reduce pressure on housing affordability. Under the First Home Super Saver Scheme, first home savers who make voluntary contributions into the superannuation system can withdraw those contributions (up to certain limits) and an amount of associated earnings for the purposes of purchasing their first home.

The scheme benefits the users as concessional contributions to superannuation are only taxed at 15% which is usually less than your marginal income tax rate. When the funds associated with these concessional contributions are withdrawn to purchase a house they are taxed at marginal rates less a 30% tax offset. This sounds quite complicated and we'll see it in practice below.

**Who can use the scheme**

Anyone who:

1. is over the age of 18, and
2. has never held a freehold interest in real property

can apply for eligible contributions and the associated earnings to be released

**Limits on contributions**

At present, you are limited to contributing a maximum of

* $15,000.00 in any one financial year
* $50,000.00 in total

These contributions are also subject to the standard superannuation contribution caps of:

* $30,000.00 for concessional contributions plus any carried forward balance
* $120,000.00 for non-concessional contributions

The type of contribution also impacts the releaseable amount:

* 85% of concessional contributions are releasable
* 100% of non-concessional contributions are releasable

**Rate of Earnings**

Earnings on the funds contributed to the scheme are calculated using the Shortfall interest charge (SIC) rates published by the ATO each quarter. This rate is calculated as a 3% increase over the 90-day Bank Accepted Bill rate as published by the Reserve Bank. At present for the September 2025 quarter the rate is a daily rate of 0.018575340% or 6.78% annualised. The rate is calculated from the start of the month in which the contribution is made and calculated up until the date the ATO calculates it's determination for a release under the scheme.

**First Home Super Saver Scheme in practice**

Let’s build a realistic profile for our homebuyer, Joe Average — using real national averages to show how the First Home Super Saver Scheme works in practice.

Joe is a 22-year-old single male who has been working in sales (one of the most common occupations in Australia) for the past 12 months following graduating from university. He earns $112,819.20 per year plus super, which reflects the average full-time earnings for an Australian male. Joe has $13,069 in savings and a HECS-HELP debt of $27,640 — both figures based on national averages for Australians his age. So far, Joe has been working since he was 15 but has only received standard employer superannuation contributions and hasn’t made any voluntary contributions, meaning he has his full unused concessional contributions cap available. The average entry-level property price in Melbourne for first-home buyers is $670,000, however due to affordability the Joe is looking to spend $500,000 and would like to buy by 1 Jan 2029 with the projections beginning 1 Jul 2024.

To start modelling this scenario we need to create his profile which looks like:

Based on his budget surplus, Joe will comfortably be able to make the maximum allowable annual contributions under the scheme. Starting from 1 July 2024, we can schedule quarterly concessional contributions of $3,750 to his superannuation fund. These contributions will continue consistently for three and a half years, with the final contribution reduced to $1,250 to ensure the total remains within the scheme’s contribution cap.

With Joe's current financial position established, we can now move on to setting up his property purchase goal. Joe plans to buy an average entry-level home in Victoria valued at $500,000. To simplify the process, property purchase costs are automatically calculated when the goal is created, though they can be adjusted if needed. The First Home Super Saver (FHSS) release amount will be calculated based on the expected purchase date, Joe’s contribution history, and any applicable shortfall interest on future contributions. When creating a new property goal you can also estimate borrowing capacity to help ensure the planned mortgage is achievable.

With Joe’s scenario fully defined, we can now run the model and explore the outcomes.

**What Did the Modelling Show in Practice?**

[\*Net Investment Position represents total financial assets \(excluding things like your home, car, and personal belongings\) minus total liabilities.](https://preview.redd.it/qyszdv9kp08f1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=dad494749248e421972c798f3a8b8acbd525787c)

https://preview.redd.it/fsi2hvpkp08f1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=758fc59423941f0748f91e3a4bf466f1f86b3951

Over a three-and-a-half-year period, Joe contributes the maximum $50,000 to his superannuation using concessional contributions. Under the FHSS scheme’s rules, which apply a government-determined earnings rate (based on the ATO’s Shortfall Interest Charge), these contributions grow to a projected releasable amount of $51,505.35 by 1 January 2029, Joe’s target date to purchase his first home.

However, because of Joe’s income at the time of release, a significant portion of the withdrawal is taxed at a higher marginal rate of 37%, rather than the 30% he would have originally paid when making the contributions. After applying the 30% tax offset that the scheme provides, the net benefit is reduced with the estimated release amount of $51,505.35 reduced to $43,370.75 after tax.

To assess the true value of the FHSS strategy, our modelling automatically creates a comparison scenario where the scheme is not used. In this alternative, Joe’s surplus income is instead directed into a standard savings account earning 4.35% interest, with no FHSS contributions made. This side-by-side comparison reveals the real impact of the scheme under Joe’s circumstances.

In the first year he is able to save a total of $23,927.4 after tax compared to $21,377.40 in the scenario without the FHSS contributions. However, when we project forward to the home purchase in the 2029 financial year and all the tax effects are felt, Joe's Net Investment Position (Net Wealth) is actually reduced by $13,285 compared to not using the FHSS.

The First Home Super Saver Scheme can be an effective strategy, but as this example shows, the benefit is highly dependent on individual factors such as income, tax brackets, and timing. Personalised modelling is essential to determine whether it’s the right fit for your situation.

Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! Let’s chat about something super important today: **the necessity of upskilling in our ever-changing world of AI**. I mean, who wants to sit around watching their hard-earned dollars fade away while others level up their game, right?

Here's the deal: things are moving FAST. Data shows that AIs are evolving quicker than I can finish my morning coffee, and if we don’t keep up, we might just find ourselves sitting on the sidelines. Trust me, nobody wants that!

**So, why should you care? 🤔**

- **Demand for AI skills is skyrocketing**: Companies are looking for folks who can harness the power of AI. Without some shiny new skills, you might be left out of the party.
- **Your job is at stake**: Think about it. How comfortable are you that your current role won’t be automated? Upskilling not only future-proofs your career but also makes you a valuable asset.
- **You can’t be the ‘I wish I had’ person**: Nobody wants to look back and think, “I wish I had learned that.” Instead, let’s be the “I’m so glad I did” crowd!

Here's something fun to ponder: **When was the last time you took a course or learned something new?** You’d be amazed at how quickly 20 minutes a day can turn into a wealth of knowledge. Plus, you can find a lot of great resources that are surprisingly enjoyable. Who knew learning could be fun?!

**Practical ways to start upskilling:**

1. **Online Courses** - Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or even edX have tons of AI-focused courses. It’s like Netflix for learning! 
2. **Join Community Groups** - Get involved in online communities (like this gem!) where you can share experiences, ask questions, and network. 
3. **Hands-on Projects** - Tackle some DIY projects with AI tools. Nothing beats learning like doing!
4. **Stay Updated** - Follow the latest trends in AI through blogs, podcasts, or even YouTube. YouTube is like the deep end of the internet; dive in with some great channels focused on AI!

By the way, if you're thinking, “Where do I even start?” there’s this **awesome educational program** that could jumpstart your journey. Check it out [here](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) – it’s definitely worth a look!

And honestly, it’s not just about keeping your job. It’s about being part of the future. Imagine telling your friends about the latest AI tech you didn't just hear about but actually understand and can discuss?! How cool would that be?

Alright, I’m done rambling for now, but I want to know – what skills are you most excited to learn? Or what challenges are you facing when trying to upskill? Let’s keep the convo going, and maybe we can help each other out along the way! 💪",1,1750400697.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

We are Not the shelter. Our page raises pledges to attract and help 501c3 rescues. If you pledge on a dog, once an approved 501c3 pet placement partner (rescue)  commits and pulls the dog that you pledged for, we put donors and rescue into a group message. You will then donate directly to the rescue- for that particular dog.
If the dog is adopted (or sadly, euthanized) no pledges are collected.
