We had a new guy join and everyone was there when I tagged along. We do discuss business but I wouldn't call it a 'formal' meeting. People have been late before, no-one cares. 

Anyway, I pop in and new guy sarcastically said ""Nice of you to show up on time!"" I said yeah, my style is to be fashionably late. Thought it was just a fleeting statement but then he started lecturing me on the importance of sticking to a schedule and respecting everybody's time. I didn't wanna cause a rift so I just agreed and we moved on. 

After the meeting, I went up to him at his desk and said that I didn't appreciate him calling me out like that. I had no problem with his first statement - I'm all for workplace banter but I think you took it a little too far, especially for a mostly informal catchup. If this was an important meeting/client meeting, then fine but I don't believe your reaction was warranted here. He then doubled down and said that being late is late, regardless of the nature of a meeting.

A director who joined the morning meeting came up to us and backed me, told him that he was out of line and then he quietened down and shut up. The two of us went out for a walk and he talked about how he failed to predict how big of a prick he'd be from the interviews lmao. Honestly, it's been a phenomenal start to the week and I'm just feeling great. ",6,1747616272.0,auscorp,0,1.0,False

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend ‚Äî I‚Äôll call him George ‚Äî and I‚Äôm starting to question whether I handled it the right way, or if I‚Äôm being too sensitive.

George and I met through my university‚Äôs library and got along quickly. I eventually opened up to him about some really personal stuff ‚Äî childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. At the time, I felt I could trust him.

Things shifted when he brought me to his church group. I liked it at first, but then he and his brother started pushing political conversations ‚Äî mostly pro-Trump stuff ‚Äî even after I told them I wasn‚Äôt comfortable discussing politics. George kept pressing me, asking if my views were just ‚Äúinherited from my dad,‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt drop it even when I said I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it.

I told him his comment about my beliefs being inherited from my dad wasn't appreciated and asked for an apology. Instead of addressing it, he refused to apologize over text and told me the friendship was basically over after some back and forth over text. I still agreed to meet in person the same day and even bought him a coffee, hoping to smooth things over. Instead of apologizing, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was trying to drag him down to my level, and that I was ‚Äúsounding like the devil.‚Äù He also tried to pray over me, which I declined. He told me he still wants me to come to church and then told me to get up and hug him to which I declined and extended my hand to shake. I left feeling belittled and humiliated, so I walked away and ended the friendship via text.

Since then it's been about 4 months, I‚Äôve distanced myself from the church group and anyone connected to him. But here‚Äôs where it gets more uncomfortable: I saw him at the library the other day. When I got up from my seat, I noticed he was sitting two rows ahead of me, with his back to me. Later, after I came back from getting a drink of water, I saw that he‚Äôd moved a couple rows forward ‚Äî this time directly facing me.

His brother also randomly removed me on Social Media, and George has been acting like nothing happened ‚Äî giving me fist bumps and saying ""what's up Jakob"". A couple of his friends have reached out, but I haven‚Äôt said much ‚Äî just that I‚Äôve been busy.

Now, I feel like he's painting me out in a negative light since I've received texts once in a while from different members of the church asking me to come and I just say I appreciate them reaching out but I'm busy.

AITA for cutting him off completely or should I just move on and let it be? His friends have completely stopped reaching out now.",1,1747616227.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The market for Bogg Cup Holders is expanding, encompassing several models with distinct characteristics. Let‚Äôs delve into the key features that differentiate the best on the market.

**Material and Durability**

Most Bogg Cup Holders are constructed from high-quality EVA foam, the same material as the Bogg Bag itself. Eva foam is known for its lightweight properties and resistance to water. The best cup holders utilize a denser form of Eva foam,which is more resistant to deformation and cracking,ensuring long-term durability even with regular use. The seams and attachment points are often reinforced to further enhance the lifespan of the product.**Attachment Mechanism**

This frequently enough involves a combination of pegs and grooves, or twist-and-lock designs, that minimize movement and prevent the cup holder from dislodging even when the bag is heavily loaded or subjected to rough handling. The integrity of the attachment point directly impacts the stability of the beverages being carried.

**Cup Size accommodation**

One size does not fit all when it comes to beverage containers. The best bogg Cup Holders are designed to accommodate a wide range of cup sizes, from standard water bottles to larger tumblers and even some wider-based coffee cups. This versatility is frequently enough achieved through a slightly tapered design on the inner walls of the cup holder, or a flexible opening that can expand and contract to fit differently sized containers without compromising stability.

**Insulation Properties**

While not a primary feature, some premium Bogg Cup Holders incorporate a thin layer of insulation within the Eva foam.This insulation helps maintain the temperature of the beverage for a slightly longer period, keeping cold drinks cooler and warm drinks warmer for a moderate duration.This insulation is intended to enhance the overall user experience, particularly during outdoor activities.

**Drainage System**

The inclusion of a drainage system is another significant feature found in top-quality Bogg Cup Holders. Small holes at the bottom of the cup holder allow liquids from spills or condensation inside the holder to drain out easily, preventing stagnant water that could lead to odors or bacterial growth. This feature makes cleaning considerably easier and prolongs the life of the cup holder.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality Bogg Cup Holder translates to numerous practical benefits for Bogg Bag users.

**Spill Prevention:** A secure cup holder drastically reduces the risk of spills within the Bogg Bag.

With a well-designed cup holder, your drinks stay upright, protecting your phone, sunscreen, towels, and other essentials from liquid damage.

**Freeing Up Interior Space:** By moving beverages out of the main compartment of the Bogg Bag, the interior space becomes more organized and accessible. This is especially crucial when packing items for a day trip or outing where space is limited.

This ease of maintenance helps keep your Bogg Bag and its accessories hygienic and ready for use.**Improved Organization:** With beverages relegated to the exterior of the bag, it contributes to a more organized and streamlined packing experience. This is particularly beneficial for users who like to keep their Bogg Bag tidy and easily accessible.No more rummaging through a cluttered bag to find your water bottle; a secure cup holder keeps your drinks within reach and your belongings neatly arranged.

we got to the point where we really wanted to tell each other ‚Äúi love you‚Äù but i was so stupid for not taking my chance, sa stupidity ko sinabi ko na lang sakanya na ‚Äúill just wait for the day that ill be able to love you‚Äù or some shit. we were in this relationship thing for at least a few months but i was so immature and eventually my immaturity got the best of me and i ended things, though i genuinely felt that i was‚Äôt good enough for her because she‚Äôs not only beautiful she is smart and talented like lahat nasa kanya na and her personality is amazing. i ended things with her and galit na galit siya sakin when i was doing it and i was saying all these stupid things and she really wanted me to stop being an idiot pero di ako nakinig.

even after all the grief i put her through she still managed to forgive me and we decided on staying friends, not long after we ended things she cam back here sa pilipinas and i saw it as a chance for me to make things right. so i asked her out and she agreed because we kept in touch naman, during our ‚Äúdate‚Äù if you will, i asked her if i could still try again and she basically said no kasi she was already entertaining someone else, i was heartbroken but i feel like i deserved it, though she kept on saying ‚Äúdapat talaga hindi mo ako binitawan eh‚Äù in a comedic way. i picked up the signals but i wanted to respect her decision, so we decided to remain friends either way and a few days after she went back home to her family again and finish her studies. we kept in touch the following years and i was able to see her again when she came back here sa pilipinas to see our friends and she was clingy then and she always wanted to get my attention somehow, of course i wanter her attention as well, and our friends picked up on it, though the guy she was entertaining then is jowa na niya by then so i didn‚Äôt try anything and i was of course seeing other people by then. but we knew there was this thing between us and we were just rational enough to not let anything happen, and at this point you probably guessed it umuwi uli siya sa country niya for studies and all that. 

we kept in touch and we spoke every once in a while and since 2018 or 2019 i think, she was consistent with greeting me on my birthday and i would try and do the same for her. and at some point she admitted to me na rito siya magaaral sa pilipinas for college, i was ecstatic kasi i would get to see her more and maybe spend time with her a lot more for sure so i helped her out with looking for a university to apply to and throughout the pandemic she would message me regarding which clothes would look good on her and which thing would be good for this thing ganon. i never picked up these ‚Äúsignals‚Äù kasi in my head we really are just friends na lang kasi she has someone na and for me that was enough to not paint any meaning within her actions. regret +3. she stopped greeting me for my birthday around 2021 and our last actual conversation was june 2022, which was the last time i saw her in person as of writing this.

i was in a relationship at this point and my gf at the time and i were together for maybe at least 9-10 months at that point. my ex knew the situation with my totga and at that point our relationship was getting rocky and not long after we broke up on our 1 year anniversary itself, going back nagkayayaan ang friend group namin ni totga for coffee and since we rarely see her pumayag talaga kami. in just a few years her face matured in a good way and she was absolutely breathtaking, i was happy to see her of course and our friends kasi the pandemic was really something else. im probably assuming and i probably read too much into her actions that night but the way she looked at me and the way we interacted with each other was something else, but ayun nga may jowa ako. so i asked her the ‚Äúkayo pa ba‚Äù question at some point and sabi niya hindi na raw and that she was single. so i was like ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ okay‚Äù. bad timing na naman. then after a few days we just lost touch. life went its way. our group chat would still occasionally get msgs from each other but overtime it went out kasi nagkanyakanya na lahat.

fast forward to 2024 and i dont remember much how our conversation went kasi i was shocked nung inamin niya sakin na babalik na siya sa former country after she graduates here sa pilipinas, despite her being here sa pilipinas we really never got to see each other in person and just like with her studying here ako yung isa sa mga una niyang sinabihan, and at this point may bago na rin siyang boyfriend and i have a partner of my own na rin. since then on and off communication until recently when we spoke to each other and inamin niya na break na sila nung jowa niya, and i asked her gaano na sila katagal and she said around 3 years so napa question talaga ako sa bilang so i asked her again ‚Äúnung nag meet ba tayo last time kayo na?‚Äù and sabi niya oo bago bago pa lang and it fucked me up so bad kasi sabi niya sakin initially wala nga raw siyang jowa. i was never really able to let her go because she is one of the best people i know and yes it may not mean much kasi i guess we did lose contact for a while but i stand by my statement. 

i can‚Äôt really do much anymore kasi pamilyado na ako and i love my family, i understand this should be the last thing i should be thinking about pero i had to let it out and it seemed this subreddit seemed like an open space for shit like this and i just wanted to share this story in hopes that it could help me move on.

i still love her and i dont think its going away anytime soon but i know myself enough to not be irrational and besides what‚Äôs the point if aalis na rin naman siya ng pilipinas in a few months.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/1aUvqSe)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you‚Äôve watched recently?

I slept in till 7:30 and walked outside to get my garden irrigation on (I laid it of course) and pinched off some tomato vine suckers 

Went back upstairs and was immediately presented with Monopoly setup from a 9 year old girl. Played for 90 minutes. Giving her a store of good memories is my  mission.

We did our little Sunday grocery errands. She walked over and bought her own hotdog as I'm big on independent kids. I was raised taking the bus for an hour to lay on beaches at 15. 

I begged for a nap at home and watched Dateline. Drank a 2pm cup of coffee. 

Sat in my driveway and drew with chalk and we traced each other like dead body crime scenes.

Came in my house and blasted some 5 Finger Death Punch and cleaned my kitchen. And regular stuff.

My skate rat girl life in California is a distant memory. I grow things well and make bread and broth and soup and everything else. 

I did so many things we were basically criminals and I did get hurt a few times and we just concealed that of course. Was told I would be nothing, lower expectations by adults.
I could truly be dead from the antics I was up to as 90s teen.

Tomorrow I'll be back in my office being a corporate bookkeeper. I make no sense at all. I'm smart I have worth I have so many minor skills that mean a lot.

And I still don't recommend F around with me cause you'll find out. 

I am two kids Mom and I care about them a lot more than I think anyone ever cared about me.

In a couple of days I'm going to get my son from school in North Carolina and I literally cannot tell you how I love this kid. Start a war, stop a train, give away all of me if it means he lives another day. He and I lived a life of abject ish before I rose up and saved us. Baby sister has no concept of this life. 

No one saved me, I saved me and us and them. Now we're over here being average and almost boring.

But don't worry under the soccer Mom I'll straight up tell someone what the F is up at the farm stand or anywhere really if someone's starting some ish I'll help them finish it.

Feral kid for life.

* üìà Break down earnings plays (TSLA, NVDA, you name it)
* üìÖ Host local meetups or watchlists over coffee or a beer
* ü§ñ Talk about tools, bots, and AI setups helping your trades
* üö® Discuss risk management, tax implications, or broker tips
* üí¨ Even casual day-in-the-life chats about trading from SF

If you're based in San Francisco or nearby and actively trading (or curious to start), drop a comment with:

1. Your favorite strategy or ticker
2. What you hope to get out of this community
3. Any cool tools you use (AI, scripts, dashboards?)

In my close friends group there is only me (32f), my sister (33f) and 2 others (34f). We've been bff since like childhood, on and off, I would say, but not because of fights or disagreements, but rather due to work and life circumstances: two of us are married with 2 Kids, one got married in July 2024 and one is single. 
We are now in that stage where we barely meet, (I think it was 3-4 times the entire past year, even though we live quite close) and our group chat is basically 0. 
On our last hangout, which was a sort of afterparty at my place, one of my friends said she would be passing by my house with some business Sunday morning to which I blurted out ""oh you should stop by for a Coffee then"". To which the other 2 immediately reacted laughing jokingly ""oh, so you're only inviting her for cofee"". I was like ""well you come along if you want. I only asked her as she was passing right by my house."" And then I invited the other 3 people present as well. My friends mentioned that it was rude of me to only ask her to come since there were more people present and kept saying, again laughing, ""that's too late"" for me to invite them as well. We all laughed it out eventually, but when walking them out I did seriously launched again the invitation for each individual, to which everyone said ""we'll see"". The next morning only that one friend texted and came over. 
My sister told me openly the next day that it really bothered her for not inviting all of them from the start. And she just told me now, 3 month later, that the other friend feels the same too. 
I feel that as close friends they should've been like ""we're coming over as well then"", but instead they are beeing upset. 
My sister keeps saying I was rude, but I don't see it that way.

After some flirting and some small talk, we made plans for a first date, which I just got back from. I picked her up, we got a coffee and then went for a walk. After the walk we both agreed to keep things going, so we drove around for another hour just chatting. I think we both had some nerves between us, but at the end I felt we were both getting more comfortable with each other. 

I dropped her off, and she had been telling me about her dog, so I jokingly said to tell the dog I said hi. She told me I could come in and meet her, so I did. 

I wanted to make her sure I was interested, and I knew this was as good of a chance as I‚Äôd get. After meeting her dog we talked a bit more and I swallowed my nerves and told her I had a great time and thought she looked great, I probably said more but my nerves were already shot by this point. Afterwards I said it was nice to meet her and sort of opened my arms and went for a hug. She was pretty receptive and as I was pulling away I noticed she was still looking me up so I sent out a Hail Mary and told her I‚Äôd feel like a fool if I didn‚Äôt try to kiss her. I don‚Äôt remember what she said, but we ended up making out for a moment before I finally said my goodbyes and left.

""Another day at work. I arrive at my office and quickly take off my jacket, hanging it on the hook by the door before sitting at my desk. My coffee cup is empty. I should fix that. But not now. I need to get to work before I get into trouble. This is the third time this month I've been late, all because of the damn snow. I can't afford to have my boss breathing down my neck again. My computer boots up. I enter my RAISA credentials and quickly connect to the server. A message appears in my inbox. Marked as ""urgent."" Looks like getting coffee will have to wait until a little later. I tie my hair in a bun and open the attached document.""

**Marked as urgent. This is going to be interesting. Our RAISA employee opens up the attached document, only to find that everything about SCP-8727 has been redacted. Quite literally.**  
  
| Item #: SCP-8727  
| Object Class: \[DATA EXPUNGED\]  
| Special Containment Procedures: \[DATA EXPUNGED\]  
| Description: \[DATA EXPUNGED\]

**This is weird, even for redacted anomalies. What's weirder is that there is an image. Beside this is a redacted image, with the caption ""Image removed by order of O5-5"". Now, usually, it would either say image removed by order of O5 Council or redact the O5 number. So this could indicate something that is involved personally with O5-5, but more on that later.**

Next, the employee opens the attached email from O5-5, which goes as follows.  
| From: [o5-5@site01.scp.int](mailto:o5-5@site01.scp.int)  
| To: [alexis.rose@raisa.scp.int](mailto:alexis.rose@raisa.scp.int)  
| Subject: SCP-8727  
| Date: 20/02/20  
|  
| I need you to file this discreetly. No questions asked.

**We learn that our RAISA employee's name is Alexis Rose. The email from O5-5 regarding SCP-8727's urgent archival (due to RAISA's role) is interesting. He is the same one who redacted the image of the SCP-8727 file and likely the entire file itself. Suspicious.**

**Now, the file shows a black and white image of an old church/chapel. This is probably SCP-8727, but it has no caption whatsoever, and neither do the following images of the entire SCP-8727 story.**

**Alexis digs around, and finds the following report on SCP-8727:**

""In June 1991, the object was purchased using Foundation assets, despite the ownership's tactical irrelevance. The identity of the party who authorized the purchase of SCP-8727 remains unknown.

Through several administrative errors in the Foundation's filing systems, the property purchase wasn't discovered until mid-January 2020. Researcher Marco Ruiz was assigned to inspect the property.

Upon arrival, Researcher Ruiz placed an emergency call to Site-34 authorities, requesting armed reinforcements before communications were disrupted. MTF Rho-9 (""Search and Rescue"") was deployed to the site to provide assistance, but was unable to locate an immediate threat on-site.

Efforts to locate Researcher Ruiz are currently underway.""

**Something tells me that the authorized purchase was made by O5-5.**

**It is also worth noting, funnily enough, that in the official SCP documentation, Rho-9's actual name is ""Technical Support"". Mobile Task Force Rho-9 handles computer security for the Foundation. When memetic kill agents can lurk throughout a data structure, this is no simple task.**  
**A different mobile task force than in the SCP-8727 document? I mean, I guess it could be a different canon, since the SCP Foundation has several different canons. But it might also mean...that the original Rho-9 could have been disbanded and replaced by another Rho-9 to cover it up. By who? The only people with the power to be able to disband an MTF are...the O5 Council. And that someone could've been...O5-5. Let's continue.**

""I knew Ruiz. Good guy. He was quite precise in presenting documents. It's a shame what happened.

I drink my coffee.

Maybe I can find out a little more about SCP-8727. But first, I need to make sure I'm not being watched. I go to my office door and lock it, then shut the blinds. I look at the security camera in the upper left corner of my office and return to my desk. If I block its angle with my body, it shouldn't be able to see what I'm doing. I back up my computer and unplug the LAN cable so I'm not being monitored.

I continue searching the database, trying to find any fragments of SCP-8727. I search travel logs, purchase receipts, records of personnel trips to the area, and inventories. Whoever hid this thing wanted to make sure no one found it. But I'm not that easily dissuaded.

After fifteen minutes of snooping around SCP-8727's information, I find another file.""

**It seems that Alexis here knew Ruiz very well, and decides to find out what's going on with SCP-8727. She unplugs the LAN cable, closes off the room from the outside, and hides the security camera. She inputs her master administration credentials. After the file is unredacted, it reads the following:**

""After initial containment was successfully established, a thorough examination of the site was authorized. The church building was in a state of disarray, with signs of a violent physical altercation discovered. These included several bullet holes found in the south wall facing the cemetery, burn marks on the pulpit ceiling, and severe structural damage to the stairs leading to the bell tower.  
Inside the church bell tower (The area was reached using climbing equipment.) there is a large bell constructed from a beryllium-bronze alloy, designated SCP-8727-1. SCP-8727-1 produces a field in which thaumaturgical practices, rituals, and objects of a similar nature are neutralized. This field extends to the rear cemetery and the entirety of SCP-8727. Disturbing or ringing the bell amplifies this effect, but this is no longer possible due to severe structural damage to the sound arch and clapperboard caused by aggressive use. Means by which to relocate SCP-8727 without resulting in total structural failure are currently being investigated.  
Inside the church, there is a manual alarm connected to a tube in the wall, which leads to the bell tower. Pulling the handle does not activate SCP-8727-1, and several internal components are believed to have been damaged. Both SCP-8727 and the alarm are recent additions relative to the age of the structure, having been installed approximately within the last 100 years, as opposed to the building's estimated age of 300 years.""

**The church was built 300 years ago, but had an alarm in it that was built 100 years ago? And there was some damage by gunfire? Clearly, SCP-8727 was tampered with. Additionally, the bell's beryllium-bronze alloy (SCP-8727-1) and its ability to nullify thaumaturgy and rituals is an interesting component, which is amplified by ringing the bell. Even more interesting is the fact that the bell cannot do it on its own anymore due to structural degradation.**

**Alexis finds another excerpt of a report regarding SCP-8727:**

""The cemetery behind SCP-8727 (now defined as the church) contains thirteen headstones, with twelve attached graves. The fifth grave was disturbed prior to containment, and the coffin previously buried in the plot shows signs of internal structural damage, such as scratches, deep dents, and burn marks similar to those found inside the church. Its lid was severed from the body, breaking its bolts and hinges.""

**Now, this may actually be the most critical piece of information. Thirteen headstones? It is well known in SCP Foundation lore that the O5 Council definitively has at least thirteen members. Additionally, the fifth grave is the only one disturbed prior to containment, and it has internal damage like scratches, deep dents, and burn marks, that were also in the chapel. What could this mean?**

**The damage of the coffin was mostly observed as inside it, suggesting whatever inside it was dead but brought to life or reanimated. Seeing the consistent damage to SCP-8727 (the chapel) itself, it's clear whatever this reanimated thing was, escaped the coffin. The thirteen graves could represent the O5 Council's burial site. And given SCP-8727's involvement with O5-5, it's definitely certain that this reanimated thing was...O5-5 himself. But we aren't done here. Let's continue reading.**

**Then...we see two images in succession. The first image is a highly glitched-out black-and-white image of a corpse with its mouth open, with a cross in the background. The second image is also a black-and-white of the same corpse, lying in the open, underneath a gravestone, with four men looking down at the corpse.**

**This is related to SCP-8727's cemetery somehow. And given that no other graves have been disturbed, this has to be the fifth grave, the grave of O5-5, from which he emerged. What's interesting is the fact that the surroundings and the burial are not burnt, and the four men looking down at the corpse of O5-5 are unharmed, meaning that these images had to have been taken prior to when O5-5 escaped. Now, let's look at the final excerpt of the story.**

""It's been an hour and I am no closer to finding anything else. Maybe I should turn in for the night. I shut off my computer's monitor and stand up. Is it me or is it getting hot in here?

I smell something.

I smell‚Ä¶ burning?

I turn around.

There is smoke in my office.

I cough, I get up, stumbling over my chair, and knocking down my coffee mug. I try running for the door. As soon as I put my hand on the handle, it's too hot to touch and burns me. I scream for help, but no one answers.

My door is aflame, and smoke continues to fill the room. Smoke fills my lungs. The fire suppressant systems aren't kicking in. What is kicking in, however, is adrenaline. With newfound energy, I pick up my chair and slam it against the door as forcefully as I can.

Not even a dent.

I try again, this time kicking it with whatever energy I have left, but all I manage to do is singe my clothes. Smoke continues to fill my lungs. It's getting hard to breathe. I fall to my knees, coughing as my eyes struggle to see ahead. As I asphyxiate, I hear a voice from behind the door.

""Thank you for reminding me that if one wants something done, one must do it themselves.""

Everything goes dark.""

**Everything burns. And when you access the next offset of the file (by clicking the big ""==>"" symbol on the bottom of the page), you get the actual file for SCP-8727, which is the chapel known as** 'the church and attached cemetery of ""Our Lady of First Communion""'**. The rest of the file is forbidden access by none other than O5-5.**

**So, what happened to Alexis? It's simple. The voice and the fire that happened was because O5-5 personally paid a visit to Alexis. You pay attention to the last excerpt and the damage done to O5-5's coffin, and you realize that O5-5 isn't only a reanimated corpse, but he has pyrokinetic powers, too.**

**What can we take away from this? I think I know what we can tell. Here's what I think happened.**

**The church was built 300 years ago separately, by some other group or person, using anomalous methods. An organization that dedicated itself to the containment of anomalies (as evidenced by the non-purgement of O5-5's body and just burial) found the church 100 years ago, and thought that it would be useful for containing anomalies. This organization was likely the SCP Foundation itself or its predecessor (something like the Department of Abnormalities).**

**I'm thinking that the Foundation or its predecessor (whatever it was) brought 13 bodies anomalous bodies near this church to have them effectively and securely contained, and they were probably the previous O5 council that died. The fact that it keeps mentioning that a fire alarm was placed 100 years ago probably means it was built in mind for O5-5 as well. However, the church was likely too old and dilapidated (as mentioned by the article when it says ""but this is no longer possible due to severe structural damage""), and the bell broke down. This is when the containment breach happened, and O5-5 reanimated and escaped, becoming the current O5-5. Since the bell no longer works, and the other graves of the O5 Council members are intact, we can assume that O5-5 is the only corpse capable of reanimation.**

***The previous O5 Council's O5-5 came to life, escaped containment at the weak point of the church, killed everybody who knew, then covered up his tracks and integrated himself into the current O5 Council.***",3,1747614528.0,SCP,1,1.0,False

The 20mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate daily make me feel calmer, more collected, emotionally stable and make it much easier to focus and sit still. Before prescription meds I used caffeine to self medicate with little success and was dependent on it after some point even though I felt it made my adhd worse.

Last night I had a fever and headache and decided to take 1000mg of paracetamol(acetaminophen) so I could fall asleep. Little did I know that came alongside 200mg of caffeine. Within an hour I felt a euphoric rush come over me and was then overwhelmed by tweaker energy. My schedule 8 prescription stimulants feel as stimulating as a placebo compared to what I felt last night. I ended up staying up till 4am doing random chores to kill time until I felt tired today. When I think back to my behaviour last night I would definitely not call myself sober.

It‚Äôs crazy to think that caffeine is not at all controlled and that literal children are sometimes dosing it multiple times a day alongside 80% or whatever of the population. I have never had any compulsion or desire to take my adhd meds and have literally set reminders because sometimes I forget to take the ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù stimulant medications. But as soon as I woke up this morning I was craving a cup of coffee and thinking how good it would feel to be tweaking all day. Good thing I know that the honeymoon phase is short lived and it will be back to anxiety, insomnia, poor health and way more side effects from having gone through the quitting process once before.

I decided to trust them (but what if something gets fucked up because of it????)

The transfer went off okay, but this morning I had a little coffee (maybe I shouldn't have????) and then, workout thinking, used a little bit of peppermint/rosemary spray on my wrists and scalp to smell better (before realizing rosemary oil and essential oils in general are fucking bad for fertility and I'm now kicking myself!!!!)

I'm obviously desperate for this to work, and I know realistically the embryo may not have even implanted at this point so I'm overreacting, but I need some sort of reassurance. 

So - did anyone have a successful transfer even though they did something stupid, like had a drink or ate something 'bad'? ",3,1747614125.0,IVF,18,1.0,False

* Knowing the local traffic, they will plan to arrive well in advance of the appointment. Is there a waiting area? Alternatively, there's a coffee shop (""kappi kathe"") within the mall that could be an option
* Will VFS accept credit cards for the drop off fees (Rs 1200 per applicant) or it cash only?
* Both applicants (primary/spouse) are planning to be there, just in case they need to redo the photo (looks like they can do this onsite, if needed)
* Are cell phones allowed inside the drop off area? They will just have their cell phones + an open folder with the required papers + passports + pics.

At first, I thought it was just my router.

No big deal. A quick reset, the usual cursing, maybe a phone call to my provider if things got annoying.  
I was mid-email, replying to a client, when the send button turned gray and a message popped up:  
""Unable to connect to the server.""

Annoying, but common. I took a sip of coffee and refreshed the page.

Nothing.

I opened another browser tab. Tried Google.  
Still nothing.

No Gmail. No YouTube. No Twitter. No anything.

I looked down at my phone. No notifications. No updates.  
Weird. Not even the usual flood of overnight spam.

Then I tried something I hadn‚Äôt done in years.  
I turned on the TV for the news.

But it wasn‚Äôt just the internet.

The networks were frozen. Most channels were down. The few that remained were broadcasting emergency symbols.  
A trembling voice finally broke through on one local station, reading a government-issued bulletin.

""We are currently experiencing a global communications failure. Citizens are urged to remain calm. Further instructions will follow.""

But they didn‚Äôt.

Because no one could send anything.

**08:47 AM**

By then, most people were still confused, not panicked. Offices tried to function offline. Students sat in classrooms, staring at blank screens.  
Some joked about a solar flare or a cyber hiccup.  
Some influencers thought it was a new trend.

But it wasn‚Äôt.

It was a full-scale, coordinated cyber assault, planned for years and executed with surgical precision.  
A group calling themselves **Null** had released a video on an encrypted dark web channel shortly before the collapse.

""This is not terrorism.  
This is liberation.  
You‚Äôve lived under the illusion of freedom long enough.  
The internet is not a tool of connection‚Äîit is a cage.  
And we‚Äôve just broken the lock.""

In less than **48 minutes**, every major data center on the planet had been targeted: thermal overloads, EMP spikes, cascading failures triggered by insider exploits.  
The result? Not just downed servers, but melted, fried systems beyond repair.  
Some caught fire. Some exploded. Most just went dark.

There was no coming back.

**10:15 AM**

In New York, Wall Street froze. Billions were locked mid-transaction.  
In London, banks shut their doors, unable to verify identities or balances.  
In Tokyo, trains stopped running. In Paris, traffic collapsed. In S√£o Paulo, the stock exchange building was evacuated due to a riot outside.

People tried to withdraw money.  
Couldn‚Äôt.

Tried to order food.  
Couldn‚Äôt.

Tried to call loved ones.  
Some phone networks were up, but overloaded. Most people didn‚Äôt remember real phone numbers anymore.

By noon, the first cases of panic-induced seizures started hitting emergency rooms. Influencers livestreaming from panic mode suddenly found themselves staring into dead cameras. One beauty vlogger was found screaming in her apartment, surrounded by ring lights and silent devices. Her final tweet had simply read:  
""Is this a joke? I‚Äôm losing followers by the second wtf.""

**03:30 PM**

By mid-afternoon, chaos had begun to spread.  
Without GPS, delivery trucks got lost. Hospitals couldn‚Äôt access medical records. Police couldn‚Äôt communicate.  
Prisons, some of them running on outdated but internet-connected systems, accidentally unlocked.  
Thousands of inmates walked out without resistance.

Everywhere, lines started forming outside stores. People begging to buy food, medicine, batteries.  
But credit cards were useless.

Only cash worked.

And almost no one had any.

Looting began in major cities around 4 PM.  
People rushed tech stores, not to steal gadgets, but hard drives, manual radios, anything they thought could ""bring it back.""

By 6 PM, fires were visible on satellite imagery from above.

By 9 PM, power grids started to flicker in several countries. Not because of an attack, but because so many systems relied on internet-based load balancing.  
Without it, the grid began to destabilize.

**10:21 PM**

I was at home, in the dark, watching neighbors shout in the street.  
Someone smashed a pharmacy window down the road.  
I could hear gunshots in the distance. Not close, but not far either.

I checked my phone one last time. Still no signal.

I sat there, breathing heavily, heart pounding. Not from fear exactly.  
But from the overwhelming, paralyzing realization:

The world was not ready.

Not even close.

All it took was one hour of coordinated digital silence to tear apart the global order like wet paper.

**11:59 PM**

I wrote this on an old typewriter my grandfather left me.  
I never thought I‚Äôd use it.  
But now, it‚Äôs the only way I can think clearly.

People used to say we were addicted to the internet.  
They were wrong.

We were dependent.  
Crucially, systemically dependent.

It wasn‚Äôt just a tool.

It was the spine of civilization.

And someone had snapped it.

This was Day One.

Just 24 hours without internet.

And humanity had already begun to unravel.

What we didn‚Äôt know, what none of us could possibly imagine,  
Was that this  
was only the beginning.",1,1747613914.0,shortstories,1,0.67,False
1kpyixu,https://v.redd.it/4khvtz4bsm1f1,"Shannon in relationships: Openly hits on Wirth in front of Gurney, plays dumb when Gurney walks out, blames him and he apologizes; Brags about Wirth‚Äôs money, belittles Gurney (feat. Taylor, Mike) COMPILATION!","Time for today‚Äôs Very Cavallari history lesson! Please take out your pencils and turn to page 666 because we are clearly in hell. 

Shannon and Gurney talk about having kids. Shannon says in the distant future, Gurney says he‚Äôs not sure about that. (You dodged a serious bullet, my guy.) If only she knew at the time what her first pregnancy would really be like! ü§° Shannon says she doesn‚Äôt want a redheaded child.  

Shannon guilt-trips Gurney repeatedly for the way he spends *his own goddamn money.* Wants him to get his own car because ‚Äúhelping him out‚Äù with hers is ‚Äúexhausting.‚Äù Says eventually the car issue will become a ‚Äúdealbreaker.‚Äù Lectures him to ‚Äúbe realistic‚Äù and take life decisions more seriously. (HA!)

Shannon rants to her girlies about Gurney not having money or a car, all while he is not even 10 feet away. Holds these things over his head when they argue and says she can‚Äôt ‚Äúreel it back in‚Äù. Imagine what must go on behind closed doors nowadays with Jumbo Jimbo.

Shannon sarcastically says the gang only keeps Wirth around because he has a private jet and a beach house. But was she really being sarcastic? ü§î 

Everyone meets up at a bar. Shannon gets drunk to the point that her speech is slurring, and creepishly flirts with Wirth in front of Gurney, hanging all over him. (The disrespect of this woman. Sounds similar to the way a certain ‚Äúcoach‚Äù treats *her* nowadays.) ‚ÄúYer so matchure‚Ä¶no yer such a good guye, yeah yerrr sucha goodguyee.‚Äù

Gurney reasonably gets upset but tells Shannon he wants to wait until later to discuss it privately. Shannon won‚Äôt drop the subject and says he needs to drink more. 

Gurney gets fed up and leaves (I cheered, finally a man with some fucking dignity) and Shannon starts up with the waterworks. Cries that she has ‚Äúno CLEW‚Äù why Gurney walked out. Calls him over and over but he doesn‚Äôt answer, because why would he want to talk to her moody drunk ass??

During a different bar crawl, drunk KCav asks Wirth for the truth about him and Shannon. Wirth, who has a girlfriend, says the flirting is completely one-sided, there is nothing there. 

Hungover Shannon‚Äôs pity party continues at KCav‚Äôs house, then at work. She blames Gurney, saying he doesn‚Äôt talk about his feelings with her. Says he is too insecure. (Hello, projection.) 

Gurney and Shannon meet for coffee. He apologizes for leaving her at the bar. Shannon scolds him that ‚Äúwalking away‚Äù from his problems only makes things worse. (Again, HA!) Gurney tells Shannon that she makes him feel invisible. Shannon says *‚ÄùI have no problem admitting when I‚Äôm wrong‚Äù* and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I wasn‚Äôt acting like you existed, okay?‚Äù

I could not be happier that Gurney escaped her controlling clutches.

I've been using the Harry's for a bit now and figured I'd try the new Plus version. He mentioned he wanted a Leaf razor. I looked into it and it all came back to me, I used to really enjoy shaving with safety razors. The whole ritual of the process, much like making a great cup of coffee where you pay attention to the small details from start to finish to ensure a good cup. It's almost cathartic having the warm water or hot towel, using the glide, creating a nice thick lather, and focusing in on the shave itself.

  
I had a Edwin Jagger DE89L, bakelite slant, merkur 34c (although I stupidly left it at my parents place in another state), a old Gillette, along with a couple straight razors. I have quite a bit of stuff and started wondering what happened? Why did I stop. Part of it was due to being lazy, the other part, was getting the new cartridge razor to avoid hassles while flying. I usually do carry on, and its a pain to bring a DE for that. i don't want to ship razors ahead of time or look for razors when I land. I kind of just got stuck in using the cartridge for what has been years now. All my old soaps/creams are dried up and trash now. I still have my badger brushes along with some blades. 

  
Thoughts on Leaf Thorn? I obviously already have most the tools to do the job, but I'm canceling my Harrys order and could easily buy a new shiny razor to get me back into it, Seems like a nice looking razor and go ahead and order some of my old ToBS sandlewood cream and be good to go. 3D printed a nice shaving bowl with ridges already as well. I'm wondering what are peoples thought on this razor for any of the ones I mentioned, Is it a side grade, down grade, up grade?

We were dancing and having fun but she kept getting drunker and drunker. After the 6th or so beer at the venue (she had two prior) she was really sloppy and bumping into people. She seemed to get upset and wanted to leave so we left. She started being really mean and agitated and then when we started driving she started being really bad, but seemingly was talking about her babies father. So I knew something was wrong. I tried to ask her why she directing this anger at me which only made things worse and she actually started to say mean things about me. 

After telling her multiple times she needed to stop and ask her what I did to make her upset. She talked about how I wasn‚Äôt able to dance with her when she was just so drunk it was really difficult and she kept getting annoyed despite her wanting to dance the way she was getting annoyed with. She then said it was her who couldn‚Äôt dance and started saying how she‚Äôs ugly and no good, and she doesn‚Äôt deserve me and she was going to kill herself. She then attempted to open my car door while I was driving over 60 and I pulled over where she started to hit me.

We got back to in front of my house and she wanted to leave I tried to get her to tell me why she was mad but it was just incoherent she couldn‚Äôt even figure out how her door worked. She didn‚Äôt have any of her things and when I mentioned it she got her stuff out of my car. Left her purse and cellphone though. 

She came back this morning and went through my car and then an hour after I woke up i noticed she attempted to call her phone. I went to get a coffee and when I got back about ten minutes after she knocked on my door. 

She asked what happened and that she doesn‚Äôt remember anything and she wasn‚Äôt really angry and genially I felt like she didn‚Äôt remember. However when I told her she got sloppy and was really mean she didn‚Äôt wanna hear it and demanded her stuff back. I tried to have her wait outside but she bum rushed in and took her stuff but she was apparently missing an envelope of money. Which she then started accusing me of drugging her to rape her and steal her money and then she tried to hit me some more and told me she was going to kill me. I‚Äôve literally not been this scared in a while and I like basically cowered when she raised her hand but she didn‚Äôt hit me. She then just kept saying to give me the money I stole and she won‚Äôt go to the police and we can wrap it up. 

I really feel hurt and betrayed, somewhat even extorted. But I demanded to know her reasoning for why she would think I would do such a thing which she would make ridiculous assumptions like I stole her money and only left her with 20 to be spiteful. And that I didn‚Äôt get to rape her cause she got away. 

I went to file a police report. While I was in there she texted me ‚Äúsorry for bugging on you, I really don‚Äôt know where my id and money is‚Äù and I just told her everything I felt. At first when she texted me back i only told her a brief thing that happened mostly about her trying to jump out of my car at 60 mph and that I really did cherish our friendship or whatever we had. 

Then after the cops got a statement from her and according to the officer she did make it a point to say we‚Äôre close friends. 

After I sent her another text but this time it was super long. Which read 

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre probably mad that I tried to call a wellness check on you. I‚Äôm seriously worried you tried to open my car door saying you don‚Äôt care anymore. I have no idea what happened all of the sudden you were mad. I would never try and intentionally hurt you. I really care about you, but I‚Äôm absolutely not going to tolerate what you‚Äôve said to me. I really hope you start taking your threapy seriously because you need to start taking accountability for yourself. None of this fucking bullshit about how you know you‚Äôre an alcoholic but the first step to recovery is admitting. When are you going to get to the second step and stop using alcohol as such a fucking crutch. If you‚Äôre not going to take it seriously for yourself do it for your fucking children. I asked you yesterday about EMDR because I can clearly see you‚Äôre just constantly dealing with trauma and you really need to get out of that cycle. I‚Äôm here if you want the number to the place I go for it. But other than that I really don‚Äôt think I can forgive you for what you did this morning, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt wish you well. I guess you were right and maybe I had feelings cause I really do feel heartbroken.‚Äù 

Then a few hours later I realized I can‚Äôt forgive her for what she accused me of and sent her this along with links to some counseling that I‚Äôm going through

‚ÄúYou can ignore my texts and all that‚Äôs fine. You don‚Äôt owe me a response, but ‚Äúsorry I bugged out‚Äù isn‚Äôt acceptable for what you did and the only reason you even apologized is because you know you‚Äôre wrong. You literally made no sense on the way home last night except when you said that you don‚Äôt deserve me. You‚Äôre right about that I don‚Äôt deserve to have accusations thrown at me, I don‚Äôt deserve to be yelled at and told to kill myself, I don‚Äôt deserve to be hit. It sucks because you can be so sweet but when you drink to much you‚Äôre so fucking mean sorry if thats harsh. I would have given you money if you really lost it, but what you did has literally fucked me up all day and the more I think about everything I feel disgusted. I‚Äôm sending you these places now because I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have the courage to ask for them. The counseling center  is the place I go to for counseling it‚Äôs EMDR regular talk was actually triggering my ptsd more than it was helping and it‚Äôs been super refreshing. The ymca out patient program for substance abuse is run by one of my close friends and she worked really hard to recover herself and to get where she‚Äôs at. Im sorry this is where we‚Äôre at now and I really hope you just consider that you‚Äôre constantly in a trauma response, and please don‚Äôt take this as a personal attack against you. I still have love for you I wanna see you well. Please be safe. ‚Äú

Honestly I know I‚Äôm not over reacting but I have dash cam footage of her hitting me and threatening to kill me and her self and her attempting to jump out of the car and the cops didn‚Äôt seem to care but I know if I go to the hospital to get checked I would be taken seriously. I‚Äôm just stuck in the thought process of should I even do it. The only reason I sent her the links and that second wall of texts is because at that moment I decided to block her but I still care about what happens with her. I can see that she‚Äôs self destructing and I‚Äôm terrified that she‚Äôs going to do something stupid. ",6,1747613624.0,AmIOverreacting,14,1.0,False
1kpyfdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1kpyfdr/a_reflective_journey/,A Reflective Journey,"The pre-dawn chill bit through his thin work jacket as he trudged along the Calgary pavement. Another day, another shift hauling drywall and breathing dust. He was somewhere between his late twenties and early thirties, a distinction that felt meaningless. Time smeared together in a grey haze of exhaustion and cheap beer. His hands, rough and calloused, clenched in his pockets.
His boots crunched on the sidewalk, the only sound competing with the distant rumble of early traffic. His destination, as it was most mornings for years, was The Roasterie. It wasn't just the coffee, though it was good, strong enough to jolt him into a semblance of alertness. It was her. The barista with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile that seemed, however briefly, to cut through his perpetual gloom. He knew her shifts, her way of tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear, the lilt in her voice when she called out orders. He'd rehearsed countless opening lines in his head, imagined asking her out, but the words always died in his throat, choked by a certainty of rejection. Today, however, wasn't about courage. Today was different.
He pushed open the door, the bell announcing his arrival with a familiar jingle. The rich aroma of roasting beans enveloped him. She was there, wiping down the counter, her back to him. He ordered his usual ‚Äì black, large ‚Äì the words automatic. When she turned, her usual friendly smile flickered. ""Morning! The usual?""
""Yeah. Thanks,"" he mumbled, avoiding her gaze, fumbling with his debit card. He couldn't look at her, not today. Not when the camping gear and the length of sturdy rope were already packed in the back of his beat-up truck. Today, he was driving west, deep into Kananaskis Country, to find a quiet spot among the pines and end things.
The drive out of the city was a blur of familiar highways giving way to the imposing majesty of the Rockies. As the asphalt turned to gravel and the trees grew denser, a memory surfaced, unbidden. He was small, maybe eight or nine, bouncing in the passenger seat of his dad's old Ford. They were heading into the woods, just like this, but for a weekend of fishing and campfire stories. He remembered the smell of pine needles and engine oil, the weight of his dad's hand on his shoulder, the feeling of absolute safety. A sharp pang of loss hit him, so intense it almost made him pull over. That warmth, that security, had vanished when his dad died, replaced by a cold emptiness.
He parked the truck where the logging road became impassable, hoisted his pack, and started walking. He pulled out the roll of reflective tape, tearing off small strips and tying them to branches every fifty metres or so. Just in case, a small voice whispered, though he tried to silence it. Just in case you change your mind.
The forest deepened, swallowing the sounds of the road. The air grew damp and smelled of earth and decaying leaves. As he pushed through a thicket of underbrush, another memory, sharp and unwelcome, flashed behind his eyes. He was maybe twelve. His mom was slumped in her armchair, the television flickering, an empty bottle beside her. A cigarette smouldered between her fingers, dangerously close to dropping onto the threadbare upholstery. The smell of stale booze and smoke filled the small apartment. He remembered carefully plucking the cigarette from her slack hand, dousing it in the sink, the familiar mix of resentment and weary responsibility settling in his young chest as he struggled to guide her stumbling form to bed.
He walked for what felt like hours, finally finding a small clearing near a trickling creek. He set up the small tent, gathered firewood, and coaxed a fire to life as dusk bled through the canopy. He sat on a log, feeding sticks into the flames, watching the sparks spiral upwards towards the darkening sky. Stars began to prick the deep velvet overhead, countless and indifferent. He tilted his head back, truly looking at them. The sheer scale of it, the vast, silent emptiness dotted with distant, burning suns, made his own pain feel suddenly, strangely small. The finality he craved felt less like a release and more like... nothing. A meaningless erasure in the face of cosmic indifference. Doubt, cold and unfamiliar, crept into his thoughts.
Morning arrived damp and grey. He shivered, kicking dirt over the fire's embers. He packed his meagre supplies, the rope feeling heavy and obscene at the bottom of his pack. He turned to head back, scanning the trees for the first glint of reflective tape. Nothing. He walked a few paces in the direction he thought he‚Äôd come from. Still nothing. He checked his pockets. The roll of tape wasn't there. He must have dropped it, or perhaps misplaced the very last marker he'd tied.
Panic began to bubble in his chest. He started moving faster, circling the clearing, his eyes darting frantically between the trees. Every shadow looked like tape; every fallen leaf mimicked its shape. With the rising panic came the echoes of his mother's voice, slurred and angry, from years of drunken nights: ""Useless... just like your father... always a disappointment... never amount to anything..."" Failure. Lost in the woods, just as he was lost in life. The irony was bitter.
He sank to his knees, the damp earth soaking through his jeans. He couldn't find the way back. The forest felt like it was closing in, confirming what he already believed: he was trapped, hopeless. Maybe... maybe this was how it was supposed to be. The forest would take him, one way or another. His original plan seemed less like a choice and more like the only logical path left.
With numb resolve, he pulled the rope from his pack. He found a sturdy branch on a tall pine, tossed the rope over, and tied a crude but effective noose. Tears blurred his vision as he fashioned the knot, the rough fibres scraping against his skin. He looped the other end around his neck, the weight of it settling ominously. He stepped onto a large, moss-covered rock beneath the branch, took a shaky breath, and closed his eyes. The darkness behind his eyelids wasn't complete; for a fleeting, unbidden instant, an image of the barista's smile ‚Äì genuine, warm, the honey colour of her eyes seeing him, truly seeing him, if only for a moment over a coffee cup ‚Äì cut through the despair. Just as he prepared to step off, to surrender to the void, a tiny flicker of light at the very edge of his vision, even through nearly closed lids, made him hesitate. Low down, near the base of a spruce tree fifty feet away, something shone faintly in the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves. He squinted. It wasn't a trick of the light. It was small, rectangular, and unmistakably reflective.
The last piece of tape.
He froze, the rope suddenly feeling incredibly tight around his neck. He hadn't lost it. It was right there. A way out.
Slowly, carefully, he loosened the noose, pulling it over his head. His hands were shaking. He stumbled towards the flicker of light, his heart pounding against his ribs. He reached down and touched the smooth plastic surface of the tape, clinging precariously to a low-hanging twig.
Holding it in his hand, looking from the tape to the noose still dangling from the branch, felt like seeing his life split into two distinct paths. One path led to oblivion, the other... back. Back to the truck, back to Calgary, back to the dust and the exhaustion, but also back to the smell of coffee, the possibility of warmth, the memory of his father's hand, the vastness of the stars.
He took it as a sign. Not a divine one, perhaps, but a sign from circumstance, from chance, from the simple fact that he hadn't lost the marker. He wasn't meant to end it here, alone in the woods.
He untied the noose, coiled the rope, and stuffed it deep into his pack. Following the trail of reflective markers, which now seemed blindingly obvious, he walked out of the forest. The drive back to Calgary felt different. The mountains still loomed, but they felt less like judges and more like silent witnesses.
He didn't know what would happen next. He didn't know if he could fix the broken parts of himself. But as he drove towards the city limits, one clear intention formed in his mind. Tomorrow morning, he would go to The Roasterie. And this time, he would say hello. He would look her in the eye and maybe, just maybe, ask her name.

1kpyfbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_thejamsocial/comments/1kpyfbk/how_to_host_network_events_with_zero_budget_and/,"How to Host Network events with zero budget, and profit from them?","Saw this question on r/Entrepreneur üéâ

Dropping my experience here because I‚Äôm one of those people who has hosted a networking event with zero budget‚Äîand profited from it.

I made a video explaining how I did it: ‚ÄúHow to HOST your First Networking Event! ‚Äî JamSocial.‚Äù However, I‚Äôll give you the TL;DW:

Your major costs will come from promoting your event and finding a venue. ‚ÄúZero budget‚Äù realistically means around $50. That‚Äôs $0 for Eventbrite, \~$50/month for a Meetup subscription, and $0 for a fun Jam Bingo Icebreaker.

I see a lot of comments about trying to partner with local businesses and banks. If this is your first event‚Äîand you don‚Äôt already have those connections‚Äîyou‚Äôre likely wasting your time trying to convince businesses to sponsor it. Businesses don‚Äôt just sponsor one-off events. They sponsor proven, high-value events that they believe will help grow their business.

When I first started, I tried partnering. I had no name, no brand (unlike now with JamSocial). I went in person, walking door to door from bank to bank in downtown Calgary, AB. Some said ‚Äúyes‚Äù and gave me their card. But when I followed up by email, they ghosted me. I walked into about 15 banks: 3 said yes, 12 said no or ‚Äúno decision-maker available.‚Äù

I then pivoted and started cold-calling local businesses. Most said ‚Äúno.‚Äù Others sounded interested but ended up ghosting me via email.

My first actual partnership happened after I‚Äôd hosted around five events, with 50‚Äì75 attendees each. Once I had some traction, a LinkedIn connection reached out to me. They paid to come out to my event, and that covered the costs and helped with other expenses.

Build traction first‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect a sponsor for your first event!

The second biggest expense after listing your event is the venue.

Most venues (restaurants, coffee shops, bars) will want you to agree to a minimum spend‚Äîusually around $1,000 to $2,000. That‚Äôs a hard no, especially when you're just starting out.

It is possible to get a free venue the first time. I talk about how I found my first-ever venue and negotiated a $1,000 minimum spend down to $0 in the video. That venue later went out of business for unrelated reasons (which is part of why venues ask for a minimum spend). As you grow, it‚Äôs your job to help the venue make money‚Äînot just to leech off them. The takeaway: charge for tickets. $7‚Äì$15 is usually enough to cover a drink and keep the venue happy.

Alternatively, find newly opened venues. They‚Äôre often happy to let you host without a minimum spend‚Äîat least for your first few events.

The challenge with free events is this: free events often attract people who don‚Äôt spend money. If the venue sees your event filling their space but bringing in little to no revenue, they may start to feel taken advantage of. And honestly, that‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs not personal‚Äîit‚Äôs just business.

Ticket pricing tip: For paid events, charge $30‚Äì$50. The higher the price, the more valuable your event appears. Sounds counterintuitive, right? You‚Äôd think a lower price means more attendees. But my biggest event (130 attendees) was also my most expensive one. My lowest turnouts were at free events. The more value you offer‚Äîexclusivity, structure, curated experience (I cover this more in the video)‚Äîthe more people are willing to pay.

A truly zero-budget event won‚Äôt be valuable enough to attract the right people‚Äîand it will eat up a lot of your time.

Be realistic. A $100 budget is more than enough to host your first event. You can expect 50‚Äì75 attendees, even with no name or brand‚Äîjust a good smile and the drive to bring people together.

Once you‚Äôve secured a venue and publicized your event, the next step is to host a great event‚Äîone that gives people a real opportunity to connect. For that, you‚Äôll need a fun icebreaker. At the end of the day, people come to networking events to do business and make connections. If your event is awkward and people leave without meeting anyone, it‚Äôll be much harder to get them to come back.

Icebreakers help. Icebreaker Bingo is a great way to get people talking and interacting. The biggest challenge though, is it takes time to setup, resources (printing paper) and sometimes people may be put off. So we solved this and made a Digital Icebreaker Bingo called Jam Bingo.

How it works: you display a Jam Bingo QR code‚Äîon a laptop, big screen, or even printed out. Attendees scan the QR code and get prompts on their phones. Prompts like: ‚ÄúFind someone wearing the same shirt color as you‚Äù or ‚ÄúAsk someone what their biggest life lesson was this year.‚Äù They simply need their phone camera to scan the QR code. It‚Äôs a great way to get people mingling and break the ice. Jam Bingo is like a classic bingo icebreaker‚Äîwith a digital twist that makes setup super easy for organizers.

Let‚Äôs get down to it‚Äîhost that event! We believe in community. There are people out there who have already said yes to attending your event. They‚Äôre just waiting for you to post it and send them an invite.",1,1747613586.0,u_thejamsocial,0,1.0,False

1kpyeiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kpyeiu/the_thorne_effect/,The Thorne Effect,"chapter 1.



Dr. Aris Thorne wasn't a man who believed in ghosts. Not in the flapping-sheet, rattling-chain kind, anyway. He believed in numbers, in equations, in the cold, hard, predictable reality of physics. His lab, tucked away in the forgotten wing of the university's oldest building ‚Äì a place that smelled faintly of dust, old paper, and the ghosts of failed experiments, a place the janitors avoided after dark ‚Äì was his sanctuary. For years, he'd chased the impossible dream: cold fusion. Clean energy, limitless power, a Nobel Prize, maybe a comfortable retirement where he didn't have to beg the grants committee for scraps. He'd been laughed at, dismissed, called a crank by colleagues who'd long since given up on pushing the boundaries of the known. But tonight... tonight felt different. Tonight felt like the culmination of two decades of ridiculed obsession.

The reactor hummed, a low, resonant thrum that vibrated up through the concrete floor and into the soles of his worn loafers, a sound that felt less like machinery and more like a living thing's heartbeat. It was crude, jury-rigged from spare parts gleaned from surplus sales and Thorne's dwindling grant money, a Frankenstein's monster of copper coils, vacuum tubes, and heavy water tanks, but it was working. The temperature readings were stable, holding precisely where his calculations said they should be. The pressure was firm. And the energy output... it was off the charts. Spiking higher than he'd ever dared hope. Megawatts. Clean, silent, impossible megawatts.

He checked the radiation monitors mounted around the room. Zero. Flatline. He tapped the geiger counter clipped to his belt. Still zero. He swapped it for another, a more sensitive model borrowed from the nuclear physics department, the kind they used for tracing isotopes. Nothing. It was impossible. A fusion reaction, even a tiny, contained one like this, should be spitting out neutrons like a cosmic machine gun, bathing the room in hard radiation. But there was nothing. Just that deep, unsettling hum and the impossible power readings.

His assistant, young Maria Rodriguez, a sharp kid fresh out of MIT who still had stars in her eyes and a terrifyingly practical mind, leaned over the console beside him. Her brow was furrowed in confusion. ""Dr. Thorne?"" she said, her voice tight with a mixture of awe and disbelief. ""Look at the output. It's... it's incredible. But the radiation... there's nothing. Not a blip.""

Thorne ran a hand over his thinning hair. His scalp felt strangely... itchy. Not a physical itch, but something deeper, like static electricity just under the skin, or the feeling of being watched. ""I see it, Maria,"" he murmured, his eyes fixed on the console. ""It doesn't make sense. By all the laws of physics as we know them... there should be a cascade of neutrons. Unless..."" He trailed off, a cold thought taking root in his mind. Unless it wasn't emitting the kind of radiation they knew how to measure. Unless it was something else entirely.

That's when the feeling started for both of them. A prickle of unease, like someone had just walked across their grave. Thorne glanced at the lab door, half-expecting to see old Professor Abernathy peering in with his usual look of skeptical disapproval, ready to tell him he was wasting university resources. But the hallway was empty, just shadows stretching long and thin under the harsh fluorescent lights, shadows that suddenly seemed deeper, thicker, than they had a moment before.

Maria shivered violently, pulling her thin cardigan tighter despite the lab's comfortable temperature. ""It's suddenly freezing in here, isn't it?"" she whispered, her breath misting slightly in the air. ""Did the climate control just fail?""

""No,"" Thorne said, his voice low. ""The thermostat is holding steady. It's not a physical cold."" He felt something else entirely. A creeping dread that started in his gut and spread like icy fingers through his chest, tightening around his lungs. It wasn't his usual anxiety about grant money or peer review or whether the coffee machine in the breakroom was broken again. This was... primal. The kind of fear a mouse feels when the hawk's shadow falls upon it, or a deer feels when the wolf pack is on its scent. The fear of being hunted by something that doesn't play by the rules of nature.

He looked at the reactor again. The hum seemed louder now, deeper, almost... singing to him, a low, discordant melody that resonated in his bones. And in the air, just at the edge of his vision, he thought he saw a flicker. Like heat haze rising from asphalt on a scorching summer day, but it was the middle of the night, the lab was cool, and the flicker had a disturbing sense of presence. It wasn't just light bending; it was... something there.

The flickering intensified. It wasn't just heat haze. It was... shapes. Shimmering, indistinct forms that writhed and twisted in the air around the reactor, coalescing from the very fabric of the room. They looked like distortions in reality itself, like viewing the world through warped glass, but with a sickening, internal logic to their movement, a fluid, unsettling grace. They were like ink spilled in water, swirling and reforming.

Maria gasped, stumbling back from the console, her eyes wide with terror. ""Dr. Thorne! What... what are those?"" she stammered, pointing a trembling finger. Her voice was a thin thread of sound.

Thorne stared, his blood turning to ice water in his veins. They weren't just around the reactor anymore. They were in the corners of the room, clinging to the ceiling like monstrous bats, coalescing from the shadows under the workbenches. They were everywhere, drawn by the potent, undetectable energy the reactor was broadcasting, like flies to a carcass.

One of the shapes drifted closer to Maria. As it did, her eyes squeezed shut, and a low, choked whimper escaped her lips. The shape seemed to deepen in color, becoming a richer, more vibrant shade of... what? Not a color he knew from any spectrum. It was a color that felt like a bruise on the soul, a deep, hungry violet-black. It pulsed, like a dark, hungry heart beating in the air.

Then, the fear hit Thorne like a physical blow. Not his own fear, not entirely. It was Maria's. He felt it flood into him, a wave of pure, unadulterated terror, sharp and metallic on his tongue, tasting of copper and dread. And the shape near her seemed to drink it in, expanding slightly, its form solidifying just a fraction, becoming less like smoke and more like something with substance, something real.

""They feed on it,"" Thorne whispered, the realization dawning on him with horrifying clarity. His voice was hoarse. ""They feed on our fear. On our despair. On our... emotions."" He looked around the lab. The shimmering shapes were everywhere now, drawn by the potent, undetectable energy the reactor was broadcasting. They were like vultures gathering, their forms coalescing, becoming vaguely humanoid, insectoid, or something utterly alien, depending on where he focused his eyes. Their movements were jerky, unnatural, like puppets on invisible strings, but with a terrible, focused intent.

Maria was sobbing now, curled into a ball on the floor, her hands clamped over her ears as if trying to shut out the silent, psychic scream of the things around them. The shape near her was almost opaque, a swirling vortex of that unnatural color, pulsing with sickening satisfaction. Thorne felt her despair, a heavy, suffocating blanket, and saw the shape grow, fattened on her terror.

""We have to shut it down,"" Maria whimpered, her voice muffled by her hands. ""Please, Dr. Thorne, turn it off!""

He had to shut it down. He had to stop whatever impossible, monstrous thing he had unleashed.

He lunged for the console, his own fear a cold, hard knot in his stomach, but overridden by a desperate need to make it stop. As he moved, a shape detached itself from the wall and glided towards him with unnatural speed. It had no discernible features, just a swirling mass of distorted light and shadow, but he felt its presence like a physical weight, like a hand pressing down on his chest. It radiated something that wasn't heat or cold, but pure, predatory hunger, a silent shriek of need that clawed at his mind.

He reached the console, his fingers fumbling for the big red emergency stop button, the one designed to cut power to the entire system instantly. He slammed his hand down on it.

Nothing happened.

The hum of the reactor didn't falter. The energy output readings remained impossibly high. The lights didn't dim. The emergency stop button was dead.

""It's not working!"" Thorne yelled, his voice cracking. He tried the manual override lever. Stuck. He tried the circuit breaker on the wall. It wouldn't budge. It was as if the machine had become fused with the power it was generating, or perhaps with the very fabric of this new, terrifying reality it had opened.

Panic, cold and absolute, seized him. He felt it surge, a tidal wave of pure terror, and the shape that had followed him pulsed, growing larger, its form becoming more defined ‚Äì a mass of swirling, hungry eyes, or perhaps mouths, he couldn't tell. He felt its gaze on his back, a chilling sensation that made his skin crawl, and he knew it was feasting on his fear, growing stronger with every beat of his panicked heart.

Maria's sobs had turned into ragged gasps. ""Why won't it stop?"" she choked out. ""What did you do?""

The shapes were closer now, their unnatural colors deepening, their forms becoming clearer in the periphery ‚Äì limbs that bent the wrong way, too many joints, surfaces that seemed to shift and ripple like disturbed water. They were drawn to the fear, the despair, the sheer, overwhelming horror radiating from the two humans trapped in the lab.

Thorne scrambled back from the console, his mind racing. It wouldn't turn off. The gateway was open, and it was stuck open. And the things that had come through... they were here to feed.

He looked at the silent radiation monitors, still reading zero. The geiger counter was silent. But he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he had filled this room with something far more dangerous than gamma rays or neutrons. He had filled it with monsters from a place that fed on the soul.

And the machine wouldn't turn off. And the monsters were still here. And they were still hungry. And now, they knew where the food was.

Chapter 2



The next few days were a blur of frantic, sleepless activity. Thorne and Maria barely left the lab, surviving on lukewarm coffee and stale vending machine pastries. The hum of the reactor was a constant, maddening presence, a low thrumming in their bones that seemed to amplify the oppressive dread in the air. The shimmering shapes were still there, too, fainter in the daylight but never entirely gone, retreating to the deepest shadows, their unnatural colors muted but still visible if you looked just right. They were patient. They knew their food source wasn't going anywhere.

""It's been three days, Dr. Thorne,"" Maria said, her voice flat with exhaustion. She was huddled in a corner, watching the shadows with wide, haunted eyes. ""Three days of... this. And it won't stop. Nothing works.""

Thorne rubbed his temples, the lack of sleep a physical ache behind his eyes. ""I know, Maria. I've tried everything I can think of. Cutting the main power, manual overrides, even attempting to reroute the deuterium flow. It's like the machine is... is alive. Or maybe it's not the machine anymore. Maybe it's whatever came through.""

He had found a way to detect the presence of the field, though. Not radiation, not in the conventional sense. But an energy signature tied directly to emotional output. He called it... the Thorne Effect. A doorway, accidentally opened, broadcasting a frequency that allowed something else to perceive and interact with their world, something that fed on the very feelings that made them human.

""The sensor,"" Maria said, gesturing to the makeshift device Thorne had built. It sat on a workbench, a tangle of wires and blinking lights, displaying that chaotic, jagged waveform. ""It's still spiking every time... every time one of them gets close.""

""Yes,"" Thorne said, his voice grim. ""It's not measuring energy in joules or watts. It's measuring... something else. The interaction. The... resonance.""

Now that he could measure it, he needed to know its range. He and Maria, their faces pale and drawn, their movements jerky with fatigue and fear, began taking the makeshift sensor outside the lab.

""Okay,"" Thorne said, holding the sensor aloft as they stood in the deserted university quad. The sun was a weak, indifferent disk in the sky. ""Readings?""

Maria consulted a small notebook, her hand trembling slightly as she wrote. ""Still strong. No drop-off. It's like the field is just... everywhere.""

They drove off campus, the sensor sitting between them on the dashboard, a constant, silent witness. Ten miles out, twenty, fifty... the signal was still there, undiminished.

""This is impossible,"" Maria whispered, staring at the sensor's display. ""Fifty miles. It should have attenuated by now. Dr. Thorne, are you sure this thing is working correctly?""

""It's working, Maria,"" Thorne said, his voice hollow. He pulled over on a deserted stretch of highway, the vast, dark fields stretching out around them under a sky thick with indifferent stars. He checked the sensor. The waveform was as strong as it had been feet from the reactor.

A horrifying realization began to dawn on him, cold and vast as the night sky. This wasn't just affecting his lab. This wasn't just affecting the university.

He spent the next two days making calls, using what little credibility he had left, pulling in favors. He contacted colleagues in other states, physicists, meteorologists, even a few fringe researchers who dabbled in the truly weird. He asked them to replicate his makeshift sensor design, feeding them cryptic instructions over crackling phone lines, trying to sound like he was working on some abstract, theoretical project, not reporting the end of the world as they knew it.

""Dr. Chen, in California, is seeing similar anomalies,"" Thorne reported to Maria, his voice raspy from lack of sleep and too much coffee. ""Fluctuations in seismic data that correlate with... well, with periods of high stress in the local population.""

""And Professor Davies in Texas?"" Maria asked, her eyes fixed on Thorne's face, searching for some flicker of hope.

""Localized atmospheric distortions,"" Thorne confirmed. ""He thinks it's some kind of weird weather phenomenon. I didn't tell him about... about them.""

The data started trickling back in. From a seismologist in California who reported unexplained fluctuations in ground vibrations that correlated with spikes in local anxiety levels. From a meteorologist in Texas who saw strange, localized atmospheric distortions that defied explanation. From a former student now working in a research facility in Maine, who described a pervasive sense of dread among the staff that seemed to emanate from the very air.

Thorne plotted the locations on a map of the United States. The signal, the Thorne Effect, was detectable in every single one. From the Pacific coast to the Atlantic, from the Canadian border down to the Gulf. The waveform was strongest near his lab, but it was present, undeniably present, across a vast, terrifying radius.

He calculated the distance. Five thousand kilometers.

Maria stared at the map, her face ashen. ""Five thousand kilometers,"" she whispered. ""Dr. Thorne... that's... that's most of the country.""

""Yes,"" Thorne said, the word a heavy weight in the silent lab. ""Most of the continental United States."" The effect of his little cold fusion experiment, the one that wouldn't turn off, now covered a vast, terrifying swathe of the continent.

And everywhere the signal reached, people were starting to see things. Not everyone, not all the time, but enough. Flickers in the periphery. Shadows that moved when they shouldn't. A sense of being watched. And the fear... the fear was growing. Amplified by the presence of the unseen things that fed on it. News reports, once dismissed as mass hysteria or internet hoaxes, took on a chilling new meaning: unexplained disappearances, sudden outbreaks of panic, reports of unsettling visual disturbances.

Thorne sat in the darkened lab, the hum of the reactor a physical ache in his chest, the jagged waveform on his makeshift monitor a testament to his catastrophic success. He had found a way to detect the radiation, yes. But it wasn't radiation. It was a window, and it was open, and the things looking through were hungry.

He looked at the map, the vast, illuminated area showing the reach of the Thorne Effect. Five thousand kilometers. Millions of people. All now exposed to the other side, whether they knew it or not. All now potential food for the things that lurked just out of sight.

And the machine wouldn't turn off.



Chapter 3

The five thousand kilometers felt like a prison wall at first, a terrifying boundary enclosing a nightmare. But the Thorne Effect didn't stop. It kept expanding, silently, relentlessly, like a stain spreading across a map. Thorne and Maria watched the waveform on their sensor, the jagged peaks and valleys growing more pronounced, more violent, as the field's intensity increased. The hum of the reactor in the lab, their constant companion in this unfolding horror, deepened, becoming a low, guttural growl that seemed to vibrate not just the building, but the very air around them, a sound that clawed at their sanity with every passing hour.

""It's not just the US anymore,"" Thorne said, his voice barely a whisper, staring at the global news feeds flickering on a laptop screen. What little internet connectivity remained was a chaotic, terrifying stream of information overload and sudden silences. Reports were flooding in from every corner of the globe, a chorus of fear and confusion. From the bustling metropolises of Europe to the remote villages of the Amazon, the stories were chillingly similar. ""Mass hysteria in London, people jumping from buildings to escape things only they can see. Unexplained power outages across Siberia, entire cities plunged into darkness and silence. Entire villages in India reporting... things in the shadows, things that steal your breath and leave you empty.""

Maria sat beside him, her knees pulled up to her chest, her eyes fixed on the same screen, her gaze distant and haunted. Her face was gaunt, etched with sleepless nights and the constant, low-grade terror that now permeated the lab, a terror that felt like a physical weight pressing down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. ""They're seeing them, aren't they?"" she whispered, her voice hoarse, barely a sound. ""Everywhere. The field... it's reached them all. The whole world.""

""Yes,"" Thorne confirmed, the word heavy with dread, a stone dropping into a dark well, its splash echoing across a dying planet. His makeshift sensor, now connected to a desperate, failing network of similar devices his scattered colleagues had managed to build before communications started to fail completely, showed the signal strengthening globally. The jagged waveform was no longer just a local anomaly; it was a planetary heartbeat of fear, a frantic, dying pulse. The Thorne Effect was no longer a regional phenomenon. It was a global pandemic of the soul, and the infection was spreading faster than anyone could comprehend.

""The range,"" Maria said, her voice trembling, the sheer scale of it finally crushing her spirit. ""It's... it's encompassing the whole Earth. There's nowhere left to hide. For anyone.""

Thorne didn't need the sensor to tell him anymore. He could feel it now, a vast, interconnected web of fear and despair stretching across continents, a tapestry woven from the darkest human emotions, a banquet laid out for the things from the other side. The hum of the reactor in the lab felt like the epicenter of a global psychic storm, a beacon drawing the hungry things from wherever they resided, from the spaces between atoms, from the static on dead airwaves, from the corners of your eye. And the shapes in the lab, the original ones, were bolder now, their forms more distinct, their unnatural colors pulsing with a sickening, vibrant vitality. They no longer retreated to the shadows; they drifted openly, curious, expectant, like diners waiting for their meal, their forms shifting and reforming, revealing glimpses of impossible anatomy ‚Äì too many limbs, too many eyes, surfaces that seemed to absorb light and scream silently. They were gorging themselves on a feast of unprecedented scale, the fear, the panic, the despair of billions fueling their terrible existence, making them stronger, more real.

Communication lines began to fail completely, not just dropping calls, but emitting that chilling static, that sound like a million distant whispers, before going dead entirely. First international, then national, then local. The internet became a ghost town, news sites freezing on headlines of panic and confusion, social media feeds choked with fragmented, terrifying accounts that quickly went silent as the posters presumably succumbed. Phone calls wouldn't connect, the lines dead or filled with that terrifying sound. It was like the world was pulling a blanket over its head, trying to hide from the things that were now visible in the dark, but the blanket was too thin, and the things were already inside the room, under the bed, in the closet.

""We're cut off,"" Maria said again, her voice flat, devoid of hope. ""Nobody's coming. Nobody knows what's happening, not really. Not like we do. We're... we're alone with it. The last ones, maybe.""

Thorne looked at the reactor, still humming its relentless, terrifying tune, a monument to his hubris. He had tried everything he could think of, every trick, every desperate measure. Explosives had done nothing but scar the reinforced concrete and make the hum briefly falter before returning stronger. High-powered magnets had only caused the needles on the control panel to spin wildly before snapping back into place, as if mocking him. Even a desperate, ill-conceived attempt to flood the core with liquid nitrogen, a last-ditch effort to freeze the reaction, had only seemed to make the hum deeper, more resonant, as if the machine was laughing at his futile efforts, growing stronger on his despair. The machine was impervious. It was a wound in reality that refused to close, a gaping maw that was now swallowing the world whole.

Outside the lab, the sounds of the university, usually a low murmur of activity, began to change drastically. The distant shouting and screaming from the campus had intensified, becoming a continuous, horrifying cacophony. It was the sound of a city, a world, collapsing into madness and terror. Not the sounds of a protest or a party or even a riot, but the raw, animal sounds of pure, unadulterated terror, amplified and distorted by the field, a symphony of the damned. The shapes in the lab twitched, their forms sharpening, their unnatural colors deepening, drawn by the fresh influx of emotion from just outside the door, from the dying world.

""They're everywhere now,"" Thorne said, watching a particularly large, swirling shape near the ceiling. It was almost fully formed, a grotesque parody of a human figure, its limbs too long, its joints bending the wrong way, its head a featureless void where a face should be, but somehow conveying a sense of immense, predatory intelligence and insatiable hunger. He felt a wave of pure, unreasoning terror wash over him, not entirely his own, but from somewhere outside, somewhere close, the fear of dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of people converging on this one spot, drawn by the epicenter of the Thorne Effect, drawn to the source of the horror, or perhaps just fleeing blindly from the things they could now see.

Maria whimpered, pointing a shaking finger towards the lab door. Through the small, reinforced window, Thorne saw them. Not the faint, shimmering distortions from before. These were solidifying, becoming visible even to the naked eye, their unnatural colors stark and sickening against the mundane backdrop of the hallway ‚Äì the drab linoleum, the peeling paint, the faded posters that now seemed to leer with hidden menace. They were pouring out of the shadows, emerging from the walls themselves, their movements jerky and unnatural, like monstrous insects scuttling from a disturbed nest, their forms shifting and reforming, a fluid, horrifying tide of alien life.

""They're coming,"" Maria whispered, her voice barely audible, a fragile sound swallowed by the rising tide of dread and the growing roar of the approaching horde.

The hum of the reactor seemed to intensify, a triumphant roar in the heart of the building, a sound that was now echoing, amplified, from every corner of the globe, a sound that was the death knell of humanity. The Thorne Effect, now a global phenomenon, was reaching its peak intensity. The veil between worlds was thinning, tearing, allowing more and more of the hungry things through, not just as shimmering distortions, but as solid, terrifying entities, their forms taking shape in the fear-drenched air.

Thorne looked at Maria, then at the reactor, then at the shapes filling the hallway, pressing against the reinforced door, their forms now clearly visible, horrifyingly real. There was nowhere to run. Nothing they could do. He had opened the door, and the world was now the larder, and they were just two of the first courses, the appetizers for a feast of billions.

The doorknob to the lab rattled violently. Once. Twice. Then the solid wood began to splinter inward, cracking and groaning under immense, unnatural pressure, pushed by something with a strength that defied earthly physics, by something that had no need for levers or hinges.

Thorne and Maria huddled together as the door burst inward with a deafening crash, revealing the swirling, hungry forms in the hallway, now fully manifest, their unnatural colors blazing with malevolent energy, their forms solid and terrible, filling the doorway like a tide of nightmare. The air in the lab filled with a silent, psychic shriek of triumph and anticipation, a soundless roar that vibrated in their very souls, promising an end that was worse than death.

The last thing Thorne saw before the shapes surged into the room was the pulsating, violet-black color of the creatures, now fully visible, their forms solid and terrible in the dim light of the lab, their many eyes or mouths or whatever they were fixed on the two sources of fear before them, their hunger palpable. He felt a final, overwhelming wave of fear, his own and Maria's, a perfect, potent wave of terror, and knew, with chilling certainty, that they were the last morsels of a world that had just become a banquet for the things from the other side.

The hum of the reactor continued, a monument to the end of everything, its tireless song now a lullaby for a dying planet, a soundtrack to the final, silent screams of humanity.

When I was much younger I had an eating disorder. My weights been an ongoing issue for many years. 

Mostly I‚Äôve been a relatively healthy weight. But my eating is always something I‚Äôve controlled. 

Before I was pregnant my routine was generally that I don‚Äôt eat anything in the morning or afternoon then have whatever I want and usually quite a big dinner. And honestly I know that‚Äôs not the healthiest thing ever, but I was very used to it and I never felt like eating breakfast or lunch and was always happy with coffee and tea during the day. 

Since getting pregnant I eat all the time and I know I have put on weight. I‚Äôm now overweight and I hate it. 

I knew the minute I found out I was pregnant I would have to eat more regularly and have done that but I just know I‚Äôve put on weight all over my body and I absolutely detest it. 

I hate myself and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm not going to bounce back from this after the baby is here. 

I used to be relatively healthy but now I‚Äôm out of shape and I‚Äôm putting on weight and I just want to tear my own skin off at times.

1kpy88x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kpy88x/did_i_blow_it/,Did I blow it?,"Edit bc yall are eating me up in the comments for the drunk call: I didn't have in my initial post the fact that he called me drunk multiple nights before I ever returned that favor. So I thought it was safe to do so. I never would've called him drunk if it wasn't already a pattern that HE established. 

I (28F) met a guy (28M) on Hinge a month ago. Amazing first date‚Äîcoffee turned into lunch and dinner. We clicked emotionally, which surprised me since he was hot and cold over text before we met.

After our second date, I felt him pull back a bit and it turns out he had so much crazy financial shit going on in his life. So I said, let's take the pressure off because his plate was full and so was mine. We mutually  agreed to keep things casual - staying in touch and hanging out as friends and seeing if something grew out of that.

He called me (drunk) several nights in a row and was being very cutesy and wanted to talk until we fell asleep. This was very much making me think he was not actually wanting to be ""just friends"", but I was taking it with a grain of salt bc alcohol.
 
A few days later, we hung out again, it was supposed to be just as friends... But we shared some wine, cuddled, kissed. He suggested we take it further and that I stay the night‚ÄîI declined, and he seemed fine with that. He kissed me again before I left and gave me a big long hug and rubbed my back.

The next day I jokingly acknowledged we broke our ‚Äújust friends‚Äù rule. He said he had no regrets. BUT, later that night is when I think I blew it. I got drunk with friends and called him 5 times around 11:30 PM (he‚Äôd drunk-called me before, so I thought it was fine). He answered on call 5, said he was sleeping, and I texted more annoying shit after we hung up (ugh). I apologized the next morning‚Äîhe said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fine,‚Äù but didn‚Äôt reply after I thanked him. I didn't hear from him the next day, and the day after that I texted inviting him over‚Äîno response. It‚Äôs been 4 days now.

At this point, I don't have any expectations about a relationship, I just enjoyed spending time with him - friends or more. I think he probably assumed I had gone from one foot in to all in over night, when the truth is I just get clingy when I'm drunk.

So‚Ä¶ is this done, or is there a chance I might still hear from him? My friends say he might just need space and will likely circle back because ""he's a man and they always come back"". But would it be dumb to call and just say ""hey what's up?"" and be totally normal and act like I haven't been ghosted? He's a self described ""chill guy"" and has told me before to ""quit overthinking"" soooo I'm wondering if I should just do it...

I was ghosted by someone who I was just getting to know. Is it over or may I still hear from him again??",12,1747612976.0,relationships,22,0.8,False

June 8th, 2125

On Earth Approach

We've spent three days in NFTL to reach Earth, but we've learned a great deal about our escortee. Apparently, the fine folk who pilot the ship are the Osene, the names a transliteration from their word for themselves. They're, from what they've told us, avian tripedals from a 2.3 G world, their wingspan is massive and they have hydrogen bladders to assist in flying, how they naturally produce hydrogen, they haven't said. They're birds of prey, similar to hawks or eagles on Earth, and use their legs to catch food, specifically the third one in the back, which has developed to be long and have a barb on the end of it so prey can't squirm away. Frankly, I found it both disturbing and foreboding, but apparently they're a very peaceful and united people. Because of the nature of their both high gravity and mountainous world, the Osene don't have ethnic groups, nations, or even a concept of ‚Äúothers.‚Äù They are all simply Osene, they even have a phrase for it. ‚ÄúOsene whulu Osene, Xeri whulu Osene.‚Äù The closest translation of it, from what the Osene themself said, is ‚ÄúWe are Osene, All are Osene.‚Äù It's this unity and unique worldview that made them the Orion Unions greatest diplomats and, hell, the only reason it exists today. They also have something called a ‚ÄúBarrow‚Äù onboard, but they haven't gone into great detail about it.

The view of Earth from up here is gorgeous, the lights of North America shine, covered up by orbital docking platforms and ships coming in and out. Behind the Earth, good ol‚Äô Sol peaks its head out, shining down on Asia. God, I'll never get sick of space. In the corner of the main screen is the window with the Orion Union and NAU's flag waving in the breeze together. They'd changed it to be more accurate in the time it took to get to Earth. I take a sip from my coffee mug, the logo of the NAUSF on one side and the Madison itself on the other. ‚ÄúSir.‚Äù I choke on my coffee in surprise, hacking my own lungs out as the crew laughs. ‚ÄúOh, lordy. *cough* Yes, Second Lieutenant Carpenter?‚Äù She giggled at my plight and then continued. ‚ÄúWe're being hailed by Washington, high priority.‚Äù If I'd to guess, they want to know about our alien passengers. ‚ÄúPut them on.‚Äù The view of Earth changed to the face of President Julia Black, Space Force Commander Henry Adams Senior and ASP Director Celestie Nyguen, all sitting around a table in a semicircle, the flags of Canada, the North American Union, the Pacific Republic and the Free State of Southern Mexico all behind them, as well as the NATO flag. I sat up and gave them a salute, then Adams waved me off, I still stood up though. Nyguen spoke first, her voice clinical, like a doctor telling you bad news. 

‚ÄúCaptain Erikson, congratulations on being the first human to speak with intelligent alien life. I trust you made a good first impression?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, the Madison isn't debris around Titan, so I'd say yes.‚Äù 

Nyguen forces a laugh while the other two remain dead silent, then President Black speaks. ‚ÄúWhat can you tell us about the aliens?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey're a species of bird creatures with three legs and huge eyes, coming from a high-gravity world. They're carnivorous too, but they can digest plant seeds. They've come representing the Orion Union, a collection of alien nations, and they want humanity to join as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm. Guide them to Washington D.C. We‚Äôll have a talk with them.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAye, ma‚Äôam, we'll fly them down ASAP.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, we will see you when you get here.‚Äù The window popped out of existence, and the view of Earth returned. I sat back down and turned to Carpenter. ‚ÄúSignal our new friends, follow us, we're going into the atmosphere.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAye, cap!‚Äù

**Date:** 5/18/2024  
**Attendees:** Moses, Stacy, Margo, Michael, and Susan

This was an informal hangout and not an official meeting. The group agreed that this space would remain a relaxed, peaceful zone rather than a formal decision-making venue.

**Discussion Highlights:**

* **Meeting Recordings:** The group revisited the idea of recording meetings but reaffirmed that hangouts would remain unrecorded for now. However, there was further debate about recording NEC meetings. Susan proposed sharing the recording resolution with other members for feedback.
* **Personal Updates & Advocacy:**
   * **Stacey** shared her ongoing challenges with job hunting and declining available work hours.
   * **Margo** highlighted her involvement with the *Poor People's Campaign*, prompting Susan to provide a brief historical overview of the movement.
   * **SNAP Benefits** were discussed, including accessibility and recent challenges.
* **Creative & Political Projects:**
   * **Moses** shared experiences canvassing in the community and discussed ideas for SDUSA graphics. He also explained BPU, a publicly owned utilities company, and brought up how such models can work better for communities.
   * **Stacey** reflected on the mismanagement of natural resources, pointing to Niagara Falls as a potential energy source that instead became a tool for exploitation.
   * **Susan** previewed her next blog article focusing on the housing crisis.
   * **Stacey** expressed interest in writing a piece on ‚ÄúThe Big Beautiful Bill.‚Äù
* **Organizational Dynamics:**
   * **Michael**, who joined halfway through (around 6:30), offered feedback on SDUSA flyers, critiquing Moses‚Äô materials and emphasizing the need to move beyond capitalism toward a ‚ÄúNew Deal Democracy.‚Äù
   * The group referenced the **David Hacker Manifesto**, possibly as a framework or ideological touchstone for further discussion.
* **Other Notes:**
   * Susan shared a personal anecdote about spilling coffee on her laptop and having to max out her credit card to replace it.
   * She proposed that **Michael** should receive a new computer, suggesting a vote or support effort for this purpose.",1,1747612609.0,SDUSAKANSAS,0,1.0,False

1kpy237,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1kpy237/just_wanna_know_if_anyone_else_feels_the_way_i_do/,just wanna know if anyone else feels the way I do about dating advice,"(I just wanna start off and say this is not redpill or to make anyone lose hope it‚Äôs to actually dig deeper because it pisses me off how most people can‚Äôt use their actual brain like half of it is chopped off when you asked them for advice in the Internet just loves it) I just want REAL actual advice that's not a performance..

Most dating advice out there is completely tone-deaf. Especially the kind that tries to guilt guys into thinking they‚Äôre lonely because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt plan dates‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt act like gentlemen.‚Äù It‚Äôs like being told by a millionaire that you‚Äôre not rich because you bought too many coffees ‚Äî completely out of touch with how the system actually works.

Let me break down the actual problem with dating today, and why most of the advice out there isn‚Äôt just bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs insulting.

‚∏ª

Point 1: All the ‚ÄúGood Guy‚Äù Advice Doesn‚Äôt Work if She‚Äôs Not Into You I know right duhhh but hear me out 

Let‚Äôs look at the common advice floating around:
	‚Ä¢	Make her feel like she‚Äôs the only woman in the world
	‚Ä¢	Be obsessed with her
	‚Ä¢	Be romantic
	‚Ä¢	Plan cute dates
	‚Ä¢	Help before she asks
	‚Ä¢	Pay for everything
	‚Ä¢	Be her protector, leader, emotional support system, etc.

Sounds nice, right? Sure. But here‚Äôs the issue:

None of that matters if she doesn‚Äôt already like you.

Why would a guy need to follow this advice if the girl is already into him? If the attraction is mutual, you‚Äôre going to naturally want to plan dates, be romantic, and spend time with her. But if she‚Äôs not interested? You could do all of that and it still won‚Äôt matter. I mean, have you ever thought that maybe the guy you‚Äôre dating doesn‚Äôt actually like you? Maybe he‚Äôs not putting effort because he doesn‚Äôt want to? Maybe you‚Äôre not asking him? Men can‚Äôt read minds and that brings me to the next point..

That‚Äôs the core issue: all this advice assumes effort = attraction. It doesn‚Äôt. Attraction comes before effort. And without it, effort just makes you look desperate or try-hard.

So when people say things like ‚Äúmen are lonely because they don‚Äôt try hard enough,‚Äù I just laugh. No one says ‚Äúmaybe the guy‚Äôs checked out because she isn‚Äôt showing real interest either.‚Äù Nope ‚Äî it‚Äôs always on the guy.

‚∏ª

Point 2: Women Don‚Äôt Like You Because of What You Do ‚Äî They Like You First, Then Respond to What You Do

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth:

Women usually like a guy right off the bat or they don‚Äôt.

And yeah, sure, there are exceptions. But 90% of the time? Either you click instantly, or you‚Äôre just another name in her phone. And if she‚Äôs got 100+ options in her DMs or dating apps? Good luck standing out without being exactly what she‚Äôs into at that exact moment in her life.

You could be a 10 and still get ghosted. Or worse, she gives you vague, passive rejection lines like:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for a relationship.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI‚Äôm focusing on myself right now.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre great, I‚Äôm just not sure‚Ä¶‚Äù

Spoiler: those are lies. She just doesn‚Äôt want to hurt your feelings. Or worse, she wants to keep you as a backup. And we‚Äôre supposed to keep trying harder with women like that? Or what if they are true? now you‚Äôre just sitting there hoping she changes her mind or gets ready..No thanks.

‚∏ª

Point 3: Getting to the First Date Is Like Diffusing a Bomb

Let‚Äôs say, by some miracle, you do catch her interest. Now comes the next insane phase:
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt text too much
	‚Ä¢	But don‚Äôt text too little
	‚Ä¢	Be witty, but not try-hard
	‚Ä¢	Show interest, but not ‚Äúboyfriend energy‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Be available, but mysterious
	‚Ä¢	Make her feel special, but don‚Äôt overcommit
	‚Ä¢	Plan the date, but don‚Äôt be too eager

It‚Äôs like playing psychological Jenga. And if you slip up once? She ‚Äúloses interest.‚Äù You can‚Äôt win. And even worse ‚Äî we‚Äôre expected to juggle this with 3‚Äì5 girls at the same time just to keep up?

It‚Äôs exhausting. It‚Äôs fake. It‚Äôs broken.

‚∏ª

So What‚Äôs the Real Problem?

It‚Äôs not that men aren‚Äôt trying hard enough.

It‚Äôs that we‚Äôre putting effort into women who aren‚Äôt actually ready to be chosen ‚Äî women who are addicted to options, chaos, or surface-level validation.

You don‚Äôt get ghosted or breadcrumbed by loyal, stable women. You get ghosted by women who aren‚Äôt ready to actually commit.

‚∏ª

Final Thoughts

I‚Äôm tired of hearing that guys are lonely because we don‚Äôt plan enough cute dates. That‚Äôs not the issue.

The issue is that the dating culture rewards hot-and-cold behavior, flaky communication, and game-playing. And the guys who do want to be consistent and build something real are treated like background noise ‚Äî unless they‚Äôre exactly the guy she already wants.

You can‚Äôt ‚Äúperform‚Äù your way into a woman‚Äôs heart. You can‚Äôt earn attraction through effort alone.

And until people start admitting that, this dating scene will keep feeling like a rigged game.",7,1747612467.0,GuyCry,15,0.77,False

Please read the following:

1.	‚Å†I play games (RPG, JRPG, Horror, Survival etc.) I play on pc, switch, Ps5 or even mobile. (Games I currently have: Phasmophobia, Don't starve together, rdr online) I rarely play online games but if I'm hooked or the game is interesting I might buy. (Like REPO)

2.	‚Å†I stay at home most of the days. I'm usually busy in the morning of Tues and Wed (7-10) other than that I'm free.

3.	‚Å†I'm a morning person. A lot of you guys here are night owls soo I just want to find someone who's like me or want to be a morning person as well, I'll try to help. I sleep at around 8-10PM and wake up at 6-7AM.

4.	‚Å†I love Starbucks but I'm not a coffee person. I love their different flavors of tea and their White Hot Chocolate.

5.	‚Å†I play Pickleball during Sundays and Tuesdays. I have an extra paddle so if you want to learn I can help you out as well (I'm no professional tho, so please lower your expectations). I'm also into fitness but with this heat I mostly work out at home, wanted to try running for quite some time now but with this heat I can't.

6.	‚Å†I'm also a foodie. I'm a big fan of Samgyup, Ramen (Mendokoro) and sweets.

Any other information just hit me up. I'd prefer someone with tito/tita vibes because I just like how relaxed and chill they are.

- I‚Äôm a big foodie. I miss good Italian food and would love to be around deli‚Äôs.
- I need the city to be walkable. I‚Äôd love to be able to walk to my favorite Italian place or others.
- I think Ohio is beautiful. I love the fall and even the winter. Some walking trails where I can view nature and bring my dog would be nice.
- I love coffee. While I mainly make my own at home I would love multiple good local coffee shops. One who works with a local roaster ideally, grinds their own beans, possibly even roasts their own (but not a requirement).
- I‚Äôm a big nerd. Would be cool if there were some game stores that sell jigsaw puzzles, maybe Lego sets, possibly hosts board games, that type of stuff. I know some comic book stores can be like this.

I think that‚Äôs all I have for now. Something else that would be nice but is probably dependent on the complex or community I pick is to just‚Ä¶be able to step outside and start walking lol. Not walk through a giant parking lot first. But I know that‚Äôs probably more on the apartment I choose.

What I‚Äôm pissed about (and my whole store even my manager) is that of all the things to worry about and change at Starbucks they‚Äôre prioritizing a fucking shirt color? THATS the most important thing on their list? Something that no customer cares about?

1kpxpjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1kpxpjp/ship_of_theseus/,Ship of Theseus,"After talking about Fire Emblem Fates with a friend, I mentioned how I disliked all of the story and many of the characters were duds for me. She mentioned that she really liked Soleil, which puzzled me.

In my experience, Soleil was a character that is characterized by her constantly stating her attraction to cute things and women and gushes about wanting to date them, yet refuses to... actually date any of the women. It's a very strong and baffling gameplay 
-story dissonance that is likely a result of the game releasing in 2015.

For example, the closest thing Soleil can do to dating a woman (that's not the player) is swapping bodies with another woman, finding a mirror, and unconsensually stripping. While that's a very funny and clever subversion of the sexual predator joke we're all used to (I am being VERY sarcastic right now), it is a long ways off from her walking up to a girl and going, ""hey, you're cute. Wanna grab a coffee?""

I bring this anecdote up because when I was speaking to my friend, she said, ""oh, I played the Gay Fates mod"". Apparently, in that version, Soleil IS exactly what her character probably should be ‚Äî she actually flirts with women in gameplay and story and it's treated as a non-issue.

That made me think ‚Äî after so much tinkering, is such a mod even Fates? Like, our experiences with this singular character were so different because the Gay Fates mod reinterpreted the characters to be more on-line with expectations. For such a heavy text-based game, when does the Ship of Theseus kick in and make it an entirely different game?

Is it literally a headcanon if you're seeing the ""headcanon"" play out in real time on your 3DS? Hell, is there anything *wrong* with that? I certainly don't think so, but I think it's kind of dismissing the incesty problematic clusterfuck from 2015. It's just... interesting to me. What makes a game? What sets a game apart from itself?

Trust me, you‚Äôre not alone!

With interest rates feeling more like a flat tire than a boost on your investments, it‚Äôs time we talk about adjusting our withdrawal rates. Yup, there‚Äôs a bit of a balancing act here, and if you‚Äôre feeling a little lost, that‚Äôs totally normal. But let‚Äôs get real about this and work smarter, not harder, right?

**Dynamic Spending Rules: What‚Äôs the Deal?**

Imagine you‚Äôre planning your next big adventure, but instead of guessing how much gas you need, you actually pay attention to the price at the pump. That‚Äôs kind of what dynamic spending rules are about. They help you adapt your withdrawal strategy based on actual market performance rather than just pulling that same amount every year. 

Here are some simple ideas to keep your sails full even when the winds aren‚Äôt blowing as hard:

- **Track Market Trends**: Keep an eye on how your investments are performing. If your portfolio starts looking a little tired (thanks to low yields), maybe pull back a bit and just take what you need ‚Äì think survival mode! 
- **Establish a Base Spending Plan**: Decide on your essential expenses first (you know, things like food, shelter, and maybe a Netflix subscription). This helps you determine what you can cut back on when times get tough.
- **Flexibility is Key**: Try to set up a system where you can adjust your withdrawals as needed. Some experts suggest a withdrawal rate of *around 4%*, but in low-yield environments, that might need to be less. 3.5%? Maybe less? Experiment, track, and see what works for you.
- **Have a Buffer**: Ever heard of the ""float""? If your spending plan can have a little cushion (like a savings cushion or an emergency fund), it softens the blow when markets dip. 
- **Consider Other Income Streams**: What hobbies can you monetize? If woodworking is your jam, why not sell some of your creations? Who wouldn‚Äôt want a handcrafted coffee table made with love? 

Now, I get it ‚Äì this might sound a little overwhelming. Just remember, the goal is to **set realistic goals and stay focused** on what matters most to you. And hey, if a curveball comes your way, you got this! 

Feeling like you need a little extra motivation to dive into planning? Check out this link: [Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.](https://try.sunsama.com/gdnn6ll0lczp)

One of my goals this year was to be intentional about finding a romantic partner. But the issue has been that I get really nervous about asking women out at public locations. I feel more comfortable when we have been talking for a while or met a few times. But as I am getting older, those opportunities to know women for a few meetings are getting less and less. So I figured I need to just ask out unknown women at cafes or other locations I usually go to.

Today when I was at my usual cafe, I saw a pretty girl sitting by herself. First I thought I would just go up to her and tell her I thought she was really cute and wanted to talk to her. But then I thought I write poetry so why not use that as a way to talk to her. So I wrote a quick poem about her. Nothing explicit just how her outfit was colorful, how she was sitting by the flowers by the window, how her coffee choice seemed to be same as me, and wondering what her life was like, why did she come to this cafe, what music she likes and if our interests will match. I didn't put my name or contact info on the paper with the poem.

I decided to go up to her with the paper which had the poem. I told her that I thought she was really cute and I wanted to talk to her. She said thank you. It felt like she was also nervous which is understandable. I was a stranger approaching her out of nowhere. I was also shaking out of nervousness. I said I wrote a poem for you and kept the poem by her side. She said thank you and that she'll read it. I said thanks and asked if she is single by any chance. She took a moment and said I am not looking to date. I said okay and have a good day. I don't know if she read the poem or threw it away lol.

Now I am wondering if I did anything wrong because this is the first time I approached a stranger at a cafe to ask them out. I want to be better next time I do it. Was the poem too much? What could I have done differently? Has anyone else done this?",2,1747610851.0,AskMenAdvice,36,0.67,False

His first attempt at such a model, it‚Äôs located to the south of Dry Valley where the climate remains moderate with calm trade winds. The main feature of this home is the accommodations to host parties for family, friends, and lucrative business opportunities. 

The large dining room is located on the 2nd floor with a bar-style kitchen and easy access to the wrap-around outdoor deck. The high ceiling and open windows offer a pleasant dining experience, especially in the evenings under a clear, star-filled sky.

Located on the 3rd floor is the bar room. Equipped with a stage for live music, pool tables, several small tables, and a serving bar. The indoor deck overlooks the dining room while also enjoying the same view through the open windows. 

Next to the Dining Room and accessible from the deck is a Shogun-style private room to host your business ventures. Whether it‚Äôs over coffee, tea, or a cold bottle of cider, lull your business partners into a state of relaxation and score that multi-billion dollar contract. Or have a birthday party. It‚Äôll be your house, after all.

Last but not least, the first floor of the house where it stays nice and cool all day long is where the bedroom, living room, and a spacious office is located. Even if you‚Äôre hosting a party above, your significant other is guaranteed to have a good night‚Äôs rest or a quiet place to study with how solid its foundations are built.

Alright, folks. Starting bid for where all your future memories will happen is‚Ä¶ sorry, what? What do you mean the house is no longer available? ‚Ä¶what‚Äôs a brute?

1kpxfro,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1kpxfro/yesterday_i_visited_my_childhood_home/,Yesterday I visited my childhood home,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed (bipolar II) for a couple of months by now, which prompted me into a downwards spiral of self-loathing and desperation. I had been wondering for a long time about it, but the confirmation always seems to come a minute too late. The loneliness and guilt took over me and I felt my hands numbing and my sight darkening as I drifted off every other day holding a liquor bottle lying on the couch. Loneliness and melancholy sometimes feel like an ineluctable reality but it‚Äôs our reality. I watched as my father succumbed to its icy embrace. I‚Äôm not proud to admit I followed his steps, taking shelter from the storms within, whether in a bottle or in a strangers arms.

For brief moments, lapses of lucidity emerged me from the depths of my torpor but as soon as I breathed and gasped for fresh air, I felt my body sinking and drowning again in the darkness. Everything I wanted to do seeming like an ever so distant mirage.

From the depths below, I saw through the murky water a hand reaching for me. At my darkest, I saw my childhood best friend having coffee in the table across mine. I barely recognized him but he knew right away who I was. We talked a bit and reminisced about the good old days. ‚ÄúWe should do this again‚Äù, he said, but something tells me that won‚Äôt happen. I decided to walk back home. It was a cold day and the chilly breeze pierced through my lungs.

As I walked along the bleak streets of my town, I suddenly felt I didn‚Äôt belong there. Matter of fact, it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve felt like I belonged somewhere. I didn‚Äôt know those empty streets and of all those nameless faces I passed by the one I knew was a face from the past. My family ‚Äì mother, younger brother and my father‚Äôs dog, Marley ‚Äì moved a lot after‚Ä¶ Well, by now you know what. Yet I felt like I never really left that house! My childhood home loomed over my every waking thought and inside it there was something‚Ä¶ which I couldn't quite put my finger on.

At once, I opened my computer and bought an one way ticket to my hometown, leaving next day morning. Yesterday I arrived.

I visited my old school. The school where both me and my brother would play soccer together after class, where I taught him how to skip class without being caught and where whenever our dad would come pick us up late, he would bring us ice-cream to make up. The restaurant he would take us after we got good grades closed down. Now it‚Äôs a McDonalds. I drove over the street where he taught us how to ride a bike and there still was a dent on the lamppost where I crashed and broke my tooth.

Once I ran away from home with that bike and I went to a shitty bar downtown that I heard served underaged kids. Yesterday I think I sat at the exact same stool where I sat all those years ago and could barely see over the counter. My dad went frantically looking all over those streets for me and then he saw my bike parked over the bar. He sat right beside me, put his arm around my shoulder and asked the bartender for two beers. I felt incredibly grateful yesterday for getting to have at least one beer with him. I almost could see him beside me, on the reflection in the dirty mirror, without having aged a single minute since I last saw him. He looked young enough to be my brother.

Our house was there still. It wasn‚Äôt how it used to be. The walls were freshly painted. The big tree that towered over the roof looked healthier. Our old metal door was now bright red wood. I forgot to mention this, but my brother lives here now with his family.

*It was a long ride coming back here‚Ä¶ But it was worth it, I think.*

One of my goals this year was to be intentional about finding a romantic partner. But the issue has been that I get really nervous about asking women out at public locations. I feel more comfortable when we have been talking for a while or met a few times. But as I am getting older, those opportunities to know women for a few meetings are getting less and less. So I figured I need to just ask out unknown women at cafes or other locations I usually go to.   
  
Today when I was at my usual cafe, I saw a pretty girl sitting by herself. First I thought I would just go up to her and tell her I thought she was really cute and wanted to talk to her. But then I thought I write poetry so why not use that as a way to talk to her. So I wrote a quick poem about her. Nothing explicit just how her outfit was colorful, how she was sitting by the flowers by the window, how her coffee choice seemed to be same as me, and wondering what her life was like, why did she come to this cafe, what music she likes and if our interests will match. I didn't put my name or contact info on the paper with the poem.   
  
I decided to go up to her with the paper which had the poem. I told her that I thought she was really cute and I wanted to talk to her. She said thank you. It felt like she was also nervous which is understandable. I was a stranger approaching her out of nowhere. I was also shaking out of nervousness. I said I wrote a poem for you and kept the poem by her side. She said thank you and that she'll read it. I said thanks and asked if she is single by any chance. She took a moment and said I am not looking to date. I said okay and have a good day. I don't know if she read the poem or threw it away lol.

Now I am wondering if I did anything wrong because this is the first time I approached a stranger at a cafe to ask them out. I want to be better next time I ask someone out. Was the poem too much? What could I have done differently?",1,1747610477.0,women,6,0.67,False

This is our 5th cruise with MSC and first on World America. We cruised 5/10-5/17.  I will start with the negatives, for US, then share what we liked. 



# What we didn't like/enjoy/could be better:

This could be specific to us but when we originally booked we were told that our room (Infinity ocean view) had bunk beds. It did NOT. Our cabin was 11102. As you can imagine my two kids did NOT want to share a bed and the ship was fully booked. TLDR: make sure you confirm the room type when you book if this matters to you. The window DOES open all the way down (not to the floor) but the same as it would in your house for example which was nice. 

The sofa that turns into a bed is like sleeping on the floor! My husband and son slept on it on night then the next my daughter and I did. It was legit terrible. 

  
You have to reserve any shows you want to see via the app. I wasn't told this and may have missed the memo but it was kind of annoying because they sell out FAST! And you can't book till the day of. So keep that in mind I you like to watch any of the shows. You CAN walk in but if there is no space your aren't getting in

  
There was ZERO organization to getting into the show. Everyone just kind of stood around and when the doors opened it was madness. They do scan your card to make sure you have a reservation so there's that but it was - not the best. 

  
The swing that goes off the side of the ship broke down on the 3rd day so we missed out on that. No ones fault but still, it happened. 

  
There aren't many USA type outlets in the room but they do have USB-C ports as well as USB and a wireless charger by the TV that actually works. 

  
We rented a covered cabana one day and there were people that just pulled the rope off and sat down without paying. The staff wasn't very attentive on that and it was kind of annoying when you spend 100 bucks and have someone just plop down without paying. 



# What we liked/Enjoyed:

We didn't have any issues with the food or the choices but I know that this is a very polarizing topic on here. We enjoyed it overall and ate at the buffet and the main dining room. The pizza and burger place that is open late gets super busy but they also have things like Mac and cheese, tenders and fries and lots of desserts including free ice cream .

They had those coke freestyle machines on board which we enjoyed. It was nice to make our own drinks and play with different flavors. 

They had plenty of free ice cream everyday and had someone serving you which was great. Made it easy and kept that area clean. 

  
The layout of the room was very nice and with it being a newer ship everything was in great shape

  
The coffee shop on deck 8 (the open area) was very good and the prices were not bad. 

  
DO NOT MISS OUT ON THE ODYSSEY SHOW! Such a good show and much better than Momentus which  is like a magic/illusion show. If you can only see one I'd suggest odyssey hands down.

  
Boarding the ship was super easy and fast! They have this facial recognition and as long as you do your check in on line it is a breeze to get through. Same with getting off. Super quick and easy. 

  
Again, this was what my family and I experienced. We have already booked a cruise for next year and can't wait!

I'm pulling a shot with the automated pre infusion time set to 8 seconds, with a light roast. I'm grinding on an Option O1.

My shots are super fast during pre-infusion, then go to a drip once full pressure. During pre-infusion, the water comes through fast, from drips to almost flow depending on my grind setting. But, when machine turns off and pre-infusion ends, and shot starts, the shot will drip and flow slowly. The result is sour.

Any help fixing this? I don't understand is why it's fast flow during pre-infusion (depending on my grind), then drip when the shot actually starts? The coffee tastes a bit sour, so I think something is up, but I'm not sure what. I tried grinding finer and coarser, same issue.

üóæ Tailored for Australians | Updated 2025

Planning your first trip to Japan? Here‚Äôs a straight-talking list of what to skip and what to do instead ‚Äî from someone who‚Äôs been to Japan and knows what catches Aussies off guard. No fluff, no affiliate links, just honest advice.

‚∏ª

üõÇ Passport: Non-Negotiable!

‚Ä¢üö® ALWAYS carry your passport on you at ALL TIMES in Japan.

‚Ä¢‚ö†Ô∏è Japanese police can fine you around ¬•150,000 (~AUD 1,600) if you can‚Äôt produce it on request.

‚Ä¢üéØ Bonus: Show your passport at eligible shops to get tax-free shopping discounts.

‚Ä¢üìù Note: Tax-free shopping rules are strict when leaving Japan, so research the process before you go.

‚∏ª

üì± Mobile & Internet

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØDon‚Äôt buy eSIMs from airports or convenience stores ‚Äî overpriced with minimal data.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØUse online providers like Airalo, Ubigi, or Nomad before arrival.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØVodafone Australia customers: Use $5/day international roaming. It‚Äôs reliable and easy.

‚∏ª

‚òï Coffee Culture

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØStarbucks in Japan = weak, watery coffee that doesn‚Äôt match Aussie caf√© standards.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØTry Boss Coffee (canned) or go to a local independent caf√© for quality and flavour.

‚∏ª

üé† Disneyland / DisneySea

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØThese are run by Oriental Land Co. (not The Walt Disney Company).

‚Ä¢‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄØDisneySea gets mixed reviews from international tourists ‚Äî long queues, less English signage, very Japan-focused.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØPre-book rides, meals, and manage expectations ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full-day commitment.

‚∏ª

‚òï Gimmicky Caf√©s

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØMaid caf√©s: Overpriced, awkward, and feel exploitative. You pay extra for everything ‚Äî including photos.
	
‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØAnimal caf√©s: Questionable animal treatment (especially owls, hedgehogs, and exotic pets). Best avoided.

‚∏ª

üåÉ Kabukicho (Shinjuku)

‚Ä¢‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄØTokyo‚Äôs red-light district ‚Äî not foreigner-friendly.

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØExpect scams like inflated bills, drink spiking, and shady touts.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØAvoid unless you‚Äôre on a guided tour or with locals who know the area well.

‚∏ª

üöó Car Rental Tips

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØAussies need an International Driving Permit (IDP) under the 1949 Geneva Convention ‚Äî get one before you go.

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØAvoid Hertz, Europcar, or SIXT ‚Äî expensive and less convenient.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØBook directly with Nissan Rent-a-Car or Toyota Rent-a-Lease ‚Äî cheaper, easier, and better support.

‚∏ª

üöÜ Getting Around

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØJR Pass is NOT worth it if you‚Äôre staying in Tokyo ‚Äî local trains are cheap and frequent.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØUse Suica or ICOCA via Apple Wallet or Google Wallet ‚Äî works across trains, buses, vending machines, and shops.

‚Ä¢üöÑ‚ÄØGoing to Kyoto/Osaka? Book Shinkansen tickets in advance to avoid price hikes or sell-outs.

‚∏ª

üí≥ Money Tips
‚Ä¢üíµ‚ÄØJapan is still cash-friendly ‚Äî many small shops, restaurants, and markets are cash-only.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØBring a healthy mix of cash and card. Use 7-Eleven or Japan Post ATMs for low-fee withdrawals.

‚Ä¢‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄØAlways choose to pay in local yen on card ‚Äî never accept the ‚Äúconverted‚Äù AUD price (you‚Äôll get charged more).

‚∏ª

üõçÔ∏è Street Smarts & Bonus Tips

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØAvoid fake/knock-off goods ‚Äî Japan enforces strict anti-counterfeit laws.

‚Ä¢‚ùå‚ÄØBe cautious in tourist-heavy duty-free stores (Asakusa, Akihabara) ‚Äî prices are often inflated.

‚Ä¢‚úÖ‚ÄØBuy from legit second-hand stores like Book Off, Super Potato, and Mandarake for real deals and great souvenirs.

1kpxbk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1kpxbk8/yesterday_i_visited_my_childhood_home/,Yesterday I visited my childhood home,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed (bipolar II) for a couple of months by now, which prompted me into a downwards spiral of self-loathing and desperation. I had been wondering for a long time about it, but the confirmation always seems to come a minute too late. The loneliness and guilt took over me and I felt my hands numbing and my sight darkening as I drifted off every other day holding a liquor bottle lying on the couch. Loneliness and melancholy sometimes feel like an ineluctable reality but it‚Äôs our reality. I watched as my father succumbed to its icy embrace. I‚Äôm not proud to admit I followed his steps, taking shelter from the storms within, whether in a bottle or in a strangers arms.

For brief moments, lapses of lucidity emerged me from the depths of my torpor but as soon as I breathed and gasped for fresh air, I felt my body sinking and drowning again in the darkness. Everything I wanted to do seeming like an ever so distant mirage.

From the depths below, I saw through the murky water a hand reaching for me. At my darkest, I saw my childhood best friend having coffee in the table across mine. I barely recognized him but he knew right away who I was. We talked a bit and reminisced about the good old days. ‚ÄúWe should do this again‚Äù, he said, but something tells me that won‚Äôt happen. I decided to walk back home. It was a cold day and the chilly breeze pierced through my lungs.

As I walked along the bleak streets of my town, I suddenly felt I didn‚Äôt belong there. Matter of fact, it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve felt like I belonged somewhere. I didn‚Äôt know those empty streets and of all those nameless faces I passed by the one I knew was a face from the past. My family ‚Äì mother, younger brother and my father‚Äôs dog, Marley ‚Äì moved a lot after‚Ä¶ Well, by now you know what. Yet I felt like I never really left that house! My childhood home loomed over my every waking thought and inside it there was something‚Ä¶ which I couldn't quite put my finger on.

At once, I opened my computer and bought an one way ticket to my hometown, leaving next day morning. Yesterday I arrived.

I visited my old school. The school where both me and my brother would play soccer together after class, where I taught him how to skip class without being caught and where whenever our dad would come pick us up late, he would bring us ice-cream to make up. The restaurant he would take us after we got good grades closed down. Now it‚Äôs a McDonalds. I drove over the street where he taught us how to ride a bike and there still was a dent on the lamppost where I crashed and broke my tooth.

Once I ran away from home with that bike and I went to a shitty bar downtown that I heard served underaged kids. Yesterday I think I sat at the exact same stool where I sat all those years ago and could barely see over the counter. My dad went frantically looking all over those streets for me and then he saw my bike parked over the bar. He sat right beside me, put his arm around my shoulder and asked the bartender for two beers. I felt incredibly grateful yesterday for getting to have at least one beer with him. I almost could see him beside me, on the reflection in the dirty mirror, without having aged a single minute since I last saw him. He looked young enough to be my brother.

Our house was there still. It wasn‚Äôt how it used to be. The walls were freshly painted. The big tree that towered over the roof looked healthier. Our old metal door was now bright red wood. I forgot to mention this, but my brother lives here now with his family.

*It was a long ride coming back here‚Ä¶ But it was worth it, I think.*

1kpx9lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/retroactivejealousy/comments/1kpx9lc/could_my_boyfriend_really_have_been_this_naive_in/,Could my boyfriend really have been this naive in telling me all this abt his exes?,"
I (24F) met my boyfriend (26M) last year in August through online dating, and we became exclusive the first time we met in that same month. Note: we are long distance / 2 states away. 

Our first phone call before we met, he gave me his life story. Dumped it all on me about his alcoholic mother and her issues, his depression, past relationship w mushrooms, work, and finally, his ex. 

He told me about her job and status (here on visa) their relationship, how long it lasted, the fact that they broke up amicably 2.5 years ago, and how she had moved states away after everything was said and done bc she didn‚Äôt have any other roots in his state besides him. He also mentioned how if she ever asked for a favor within reason, he would help her out. I thought this was kind, especially given her circumstances, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. They‚Äôd been broken up for 2.5 years by that point ‚Äî why would helping her still be a concern of his?

I then asked if they‚Äôd gotten close to marriage since they had moved in together, gotten a pet together, etc. and he said, ‚Äúi would have married her, had things been different.‚Äù since he made it clear to me he dates to marry. I don‚Äôt know exactly what those ‚Äúthings‚Äù are, but I‚Äôm assuming just their differences as people and the fact that he claimed he‚Äôd fallen out of love with her 6 months before he broke up with her - but stood with her bc they still had a great friendship. There weren‚Äôt huge issues, he told me, just that she wasn‚Äôt his person. He said she had become a chore for him, she wasn‚Äôt working on personal growth, they‚Äôd both stopped initiating intimacy, and that the catalyst for the breakup was her trying to get him to sign sponsorship papers (and lying to him about what they were in the process) since marriage wasn‚Äôt apart of the conversation. A few weeks later, he told her their relationship wasn‚Äôt working and asked her to try and leave within a couple months. She ended up staying longer bc of leasing issues, and he told me that he‚Äôd check in with her weekly to see how she was adjusting, if she‚Äôd found work, etc. She eventually stopped replying bc she got a new boyfriend, and he let her be. 

This was a lot to take in first phone call, but I rolled with it. It did end up being an issue later on down the line, though. 

Here are some examples of comments he made 

- they were still friends on social media but didn‚Äôt interact 
- Hadn‚Äôt talked in years 
- I once mentioned I looked her up since he‚Äôd mentioned her by name, and I said she was ‚Äúmid‚Äù (meaning not ugly but not very pretty) and he said that I was a lot prettier than her (direct comparison)
- can‚Äôt exactly remember the order of events here, but I think we were either talking about my life goal of becoming a lawyer, and he told me he really admired my drive and commitment, which was great! Until he compared me to her again and said, ‚Äúmy ex didn‚Äôt really have that‚Äù ‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt you compliment me without comparing me to her?
- Randomly brought up his ex‚Äôs new boyfriend (can‚Äôt remember context) because he built cars and asked me if I knew he (my bf) was also ‚Äúreally into cars,‚Äù to which I told him that I did not, and he said ‚Äúmy ex‚Äôs new boyfriend looks like a dorkier version of me. I‚Äôll have to show you sometime‚Äù 
- I brought up mold once and he told me he had experience with black mold bc his ex had flooded their bathroom
- Told me abt how she grew up rich and therefore wasn‚Äôt used to doing things for herself (had a cook and maid) and didn‚Äôt know how to do things that your average joe did (such as wash a mirror or do the laundry, etc)
- I once mentioned that I‚Äôd like for us to have a Sunday morning ritual where we spend time together, and he said his ex had him do the same thing where they‚Äôd sit outside together while she had her coffee
- Once mentioned the tv show ‚ÄúFRIENDS‚Äù and how a lot of ppl use it to learn English but that I never liked the show myself, and he agreed that he didn‚Äôt like it either and was like ‚Äúmy ex used it to learn English‚Äù

These are just some examples that come to mind, but I hope everyone can see why I was upset. If the slightest thing reminded him of her, he had no problem telling me and making that connection. Here‚Äôs some more information abt his life that maybe can explain some of this behavior:

- before me, he‚Äôd only ever had 2 other girlfriends: the one he dated for 3 years above, and another he dated in middle school & hs for just a couple months altogether. 
- He also mentioned the first gf some, like how she cheated on him and how he really liked her personality when they were together, it was the friendship that brought them together, etc. 
- again, he IS an oversharer and went so far as to let his last gf call the one before her and talk. he‚Äôs open about that stuff with not many boundaries bc he didn‚Äôt know of them himself
- It was also the other girls first relationship. Their relationship was more lax as it was an open one where she got to mess with other girls and he got to sext/touch other women with her as well or flirt on his own 
- He also wanted me to open up abt my past relationships, which I told him I‚Äôd do if he asked specific questions. Randomly mentioning them isn‚Äôt something I do unless with friends when reminded of something / telling a story 
- Small social circle and told me he didn‚Äôt process this with anyone else, only on his own as a self proclaimed ‚Äúoverthinker‚Äù

It was my personal belief at first that he wasn‚Äôt over his ex of 3 years. Then it turned into me thinking he was over the person, maybe just not what had happened. It‚Äôs sad to fall out of love with someone and have to accept the reality that comes with it. Then I thought about the fact that he‚Äôs just an oversharer and didn‚Äôt know boundaries because he was more lax in his last relationship. Now, I‚Äôm also at a point where I realize this last girl ended up setting a standard for him. It doesn‚Äôt seem to have been the best one, but nonetheless. 

I guess I‚Äôm just asking for opinions and whether or not this seems like a man who was over his ex before he pursued me. He came on strong, driving 7 hours to meet me for the first time and dropping well over $1k to accommodate me by driving, booking hotels near my home so I felt safer meeting him, asking for physical boundaries. He never explicitly made me feel bad about myself, but the comments he made about her made me snowball and compare us to hell. 

This went on for 5 months and month 3 is when I threw the fit and told him I didn‚Äôt want to hear about this anymore. The mentions of her decreased months 3-5 and then stopped altogether once he finally understood what these comments did to my mental. We‚Äôll make 8 months of dating / 10 months of knowing each other next month. ",3,1747610094.0,retroactivejealousy,3,1.0,False

I'm a beginner trying to dial in some espresso. I have fairly good timings for a 1:2 ratio, and everything seems to be fine until you take a sip, and it tastes off. I can't describe the taste or whether or not it's bitter because I don't know. If anyone knows how to describe what bitter or sour could taste like, that would be helpful.

The bag of coffee im using is Caffe Vergnano Espresso Crema (dark blue bag)

Here are some stats. I use a Timemore Blackmirror mini

\- Time: \~28s

\- Weights: 18g (the grinder makes this very exact) in \~36g out 

\- Puck Prep: Wdt, normal tamper 2x

I do know that the roast date was a while ago, but should this not matter as much since the bag is nitrogen flushed?

If anyone knows what this coffee should taste like or can provide any insight, and if I need any more data, that would be helpful, I would be happy with your advice.

Quick rundown of me:

Late 20s Male

6'3 245lbs

Smoker since 16

Surgeries/Issues: Went septic once due to pilonidal cyst on butt. Had 7 total surgeries until I got those fixed forever. Had weird blood in stool/gal bladder pain 2 years ago, but endo/colonoscopy came up with nothing, and it resolved on it's on.

I want to start way back with something I noticed about 2 months ago to see if that's even relevant to this discussion, but I went on a trip for 2 weeks to Virginia in early April. I have a habit of snorting and spitting, and I noticed when I got down there, the snot was very disgusting tasting. This lasted for honestly about a month before I stopped noticing, and started getting my new issues. I also had a back right tooth pulled at the end of March, so I had been dealing with some pain from that on and off. 

So about May 5th, I notice I start having what I would call ""tight airways"" when breathing. I can breath and get enough air, but it feels like a struggle. I wasn't having issues walking around either, this is just when I was sitting in my work truck going from place to place. It happened maybe 2-4 times a day.  I call my PCP later that week and he recommends taking Zyrtec and trying a Albuterol inhaler. I try both, but neither seem to do much. I want to make it clear, that I wasn't having a cough or mucus at all, nor do I through any of this. I am a smoker so I had the usual smokers cough, but nothing crazy. I do also notice some tightness on my right jaw near my ear, but nothing crazy.

On Saturday the 10th, I feel totally fine. I don't have any issues with any breathing until about 5pm when it REALLY hits me. I sit down on my couch as I am super dizzy and feel my airways get super tight. My stomach starts churning, and oddly my left arm starts hurting. At that moment, my whole chest tightens to were I can't breath, and my heart rate spikes. This happens maybe 3 or 4 times. Wife rushes me to the walk in clinic at the hospital.

Of course, NP thinks it's a heart attack, as do we all, and they check me out. They listen to heart, lungs, and do an EKG and everything seems to be okay. I calm down, and get my head in a good space and do feel a little better. She doesn't think it's heart issues, or a collapsed lung or anything to do with that. She recommends that if I feel this again, to come back to the ER and they'll do blood work and an XRAY. She suggested maybe I was having anxiety, and to stop taking the inhaler and Zyrtec, and to just go home and relax.

The next two days are quite a struggle. I get bad here and there, but this is when I notice the dizziness coming more frequently. I would also force myself to vomit at this time i.e. forcing my fingers down my throat to get some sort of stomach relief, I wasn't ""naturally"" vomiting, and this seemed to help a bit. When I try to sleep (I am a side sleeper fyi) and I am almost asleep the ""chest tightness"" would hit to where I would feel like I couldn't breath. It was the same sensation that sent me to the clinic. I calmed myself down, and finally went to sleep. I also noticed at this time, I wasn't eating as much as I normally would. A few bites would make me ill, so I would quit eating. I also notice pain in my upper left chest, but more towards the armpit/shoulder region.

Monday was the same. I had some weird breathing issues coming more frequently, but nothing crazy. I call my Aunt who is a PA, and she suggested trying some IBgard, which I do. She's not 100% sure as she hasn't seen charts, but she isn't sold on just anxiety due to the length it's been going on, and how it's progressing. 

Monday night while trying to sleep it gets bad. I start spinning so bad I felt like I couldn't stand up. My heart rate jumped, chest got tight, etc It was the same thing that caused me to go to clinic but somehow worse. Told wife to take me to ER this time. 

ER immediately upon seeing me says it's anxiety, but they'll do some tests. Blood work comes back fine. No infections, no clots, etc They do an XRAY and it shows nothing. EKG is fine, and they can't hear anything in my lungs. They give me a drug to calm me down (I believe Ativan, but can't remember) and sent me home saying it was anxiety. 

Quick note on the anxiety, and my feelings on it. Everyone I know calls me ""calm and chill"". My life is great. My wife and I don't ever argue, or have issues. I literally love my job and look forward to it everyday. My Mom and Dad are still together, and I see my whole family, grandparents, aunts, cousins, every week on Sunday to hang out, and I love it. I have never had what some call a ""Panic attack"" in my life, up until some suggested this. Don't get me wrong, I was definitely freaking out in the ER, with blood pressure up to 172/95, but I've NEVER had this, and I've been through what I would call pretty extreme situations in my life. Just my thoughts anyway.

Tuesday is really rough. I had only gotten about 4 hours of sleep since I was at ER until about 2am, and went to work at 7am. I get dizzy often, and my airways tighten often. I never have an attack where they ""collapse"" as I say, but it wasn't fun. Lots of sitting down, taking my time talking, and lots of upper chest tightness. I felt off and like there was a chance I could just pass out a lot of the day. This is also when I start to feel more ""sick"". Thus far, I didn't have that feeling of ""Oh I've got the flu, or a head cold"" but I would occasionally have an odd taste in my mouth, or get fatigued or warm. Never ran a fever either. Just a hint of ""Maybe I'm just sick?"" here and there. A coworker mentions to me often that day ""You're really going through something, huh?"" when I talked to him, or he noticed my face when I am ""getting tight & dizzy"". Funny enough, I do sleep through Tuesday night with no issues from about 7pm to 5:30am.

Wednesday I notice I feel really dizzy and really ""tight"" in the morning. I smoke a cigarette, which I notice this time makes me dizzy, and then head off to work. On my way, it gets bad again, I tell myself I should probably take a particular turn to go to another local ER, but decide I am fine, and maybe it really is anxiety and I'll just go for a walk when I get to work. When I get to work, I get bad. I am super dizzy, I can't keep my head on straight. I decide to go have another cigarette and walk to calm down (I know, I know) and this is when it gets REALLY bad, I am basically falling down. Chest is tight, dizzy to the max, and I am absolutely freaking out at this point. I have to scan in my door card on my knees. Coworkers notice, and rush me to a different ER from the first (This one is more highly regarded in our area).

Again, ER suspects heart attack, as it's the same signs. Chest is tight, dizzy, sick to my stomach, arm kinda hurts. They do all the same things the other ER did. EKG, XRAY of chest, Blood work, listen to heart and lungs. Again, everyone but the doctor suggests I am having anxiety. Finally the Doctor, who really did listen to me, told me his ""Only thought is GERDs."" He prescribes Pantoprazole, tells me to pick up Dulcolax Overnight, and to try that.

I get home, try the meds, and don't feel much different. I call a GI I know just to get his opinions. We're close friends, as we are of the Orthodox Christian Relgion (Not many of us in my area) so we see each other often. He's even done a colonoscopy on me. I walk him through the story thus far, and as I am telling him, he goes from saying ""uh huh"" to ""yup"" and ""oh yeah"" like he knows what's up. He says he thinks it's a viral lung infection, thats caused an inner ear infection. He askes if my jaw hurts, and I tell him I had been dealing with that, but just assumed it was from the tooth being pulled. He says it's a ""classic case', and to go see my PCP for some dizziness and neusea meds. He also suggested I QUIT smoking, and for once, I listened to a doctor, and haven't had one since I had that conversation with him at around 2pm on Wednesday.

I got to see my PCP yesterday May 15th, and he wasn't sold on the Lung, or Ear Infection. He thinks it might be a case of Costochondritis and Vertigo due to the crystals in my ear. He seems to think due to blood work and xray that there isn't enough proof for infections. He prescribed me Meclizine for the dizziness, Propranolol for the anxiety, and said to take 600mg of Ibuprofen to see if that helps the inflammation of the chest. He also taught me how to do the Epley maneuver for vertigo. I told my GI what he prescribed, and he seemed happy enough with that.

I went home, took the Meclizine, and Ibuprofen. I started getting rough feeling, so I ate and took the Propranolol. I wear a Garmin watch, and when I looked at my heart rate, it was down in the low 70s upper 60s. Lowest I saw was 64. 

After a bit of struggle, and taking a few epsom salt baths, I did feel a bit better. I was able to stay on my PC and couch for about an hour at around noon before feeling like I needed to lay down, as this has been helping. The only real way I feel better is bath, lay down, maybe a nap the last 3 days. 

I woke up from a nap around 2pm, laid there for a couple hours, and then played on my PC for surprisingly a few hours. I did notice some pain in the chest, and odd quick painful tightness here and there, but overall the dizziness wasn't too bad. That was the first time since Monday I sat and did something in peace for that long. I went to bed around 9pm, and other than some odd feelings I am probably overanalyzing (Tingling in upper back neck, stomach ache, flinching while falling asleep) I slept through the night fine with no issues.

I woke up today at around 6:30, made some coffee (which I hadn't been drinking much of) and did some light browsing/reading on my PC.

I would've told you I was feeling great until about 8:30 when the breathing hit, but I didn't have much dizziness, but it was still noticeable. I did finally take a pretty decent poop at about 8:30, something I hadn't done since Tuesday at noon. 

Since then, every 20 or 30 minutes, I still get tight around my chest and throat. The tightness feels like it's in-between my 3-4 ribs in the center. It's like I've got to take off my shirt or something and move around (Which makes it worse of course, so I don't do that). Dizziness is there, but not debilitating. I can for once look around without too much sickness. That pain in my arm/chest is still there as well, still towards the armpit/shoulder area, like a slight stabbing pain. Lots of stomach noises today, and a little pain in what I would say feels like my colon, but I assume that's normal as my body is going through meds, etc. I feel like I need to do my bath/lay down treatment here soon.

So, any ideas what I might be dealing with here? It's scaring me to be honest, but I am doing better with that these days. It's just so odd, and nobody can seem to agree on what the issue is. My PCP says maybe a Chest CT scan would be an okay idea, but he's not going to send me for one, as he doesn't really think it'll find anything.

First, he's actually Cain from Earth.

Second, he's stuck in a cultivation world where people don't just split mountains with a sword strike, they build entire universes inside their souls (and no, it's not a meditation metaphor).

Third, he's got a system with a snarky spiritual assistant that lets him possess the recently deceased across dimensions.

And finally, the elders at the Azure Peak Sect are asking why his soul realm contains both demonic cultivation and holy arts? Must be a natural talent.

Expectations:

\- MC's main cultivation method will be plant based and related to World Trees

\- Weak to Strong MC

\- MC will eventually create his own lifeforms within his soul as well as beings that can cultivate

\- Main world is the first world (Azure Peak Sect)

Chapter 154: The Seventh Ancestor's Most Impressive Technique

‚ÄúYOU DARE KILL MY GRANDSON?""

A cave mouth I hadn't noticed before was opening, darkness spilling out like liquid shadow. The pressure intensified as a figure emerged ‚Äì tall, broad-shouldered, with a beard that would make mountain sages jealous.

The Ancestor of the Three-Leaf Clover Sect didn't so much walk as glide, each step carrying him impossible distances. His eyes found me immediately, burning with a fury that would have terrified most cultivators.

I felt Han Renyi's consciousness recoil slightly at the sight, but I kept us steady. After all, I'd been expecting something like this ‚Äì you don't kill a sect elder without anticipating some family drama.

""YOU DARE?"" The Ancestor's voice boomed across the compound again, and I had to admire the theatricality of it. The way the sound seemed to come from everywhere at once, how it made the very air vibrate... that took skill. Well, if you're going to emerge from several centuries of seclusion to avenge your grandson, you might as well do it with style.

*""Calm down,""*¬†I told Han Renyi's panicking consciousness.¬†*""This is exactly what we planned for.""*

*""This was NOT in the plan!""*¬†he shot back.¬†*""You said we'd intimidate the sect master, not fight a Tier 4 ancestor!""*

*""Details, details...""*

Without a word, the ancestor raised one hand.

The attack came faster than I expected ‚Äì not a simple wood spear or tangle of roots, but a complex weave of branches that spiraled through the air like a drill. The technique was beautiful, really. The way the wood twisted and compressed, guided by perfectly controlled rouqi... if I wasn't the target, I would have taken notes.

But I was the target, and more importantly, I was ready.

The wooden drill shot toward me with enough force to level a small building. Li Jie's eyes widened ‚Äì probably expecting to see me either dodge the attack or counter with something more devasting. Instead, something much more interesting happened.

The moment the Ancestor's attack came within range of my qi, it... changed course. Like a puppy spotting its favorite toy, the wood construct completely ignored its original trajectory and curved around me in what could only be described as an eager spiral.

I reached out and patted it. The wood actually vibrated with pleasure.

The Ancestor jumped high into the air, covering the distance across the sect in less time than it took for me to blink, and landed on the ground in front of the tree with a large thud that cracked the stone beneath his feet. His expression when he looked up and realized that his attack didn‚Äôt have the intended effect was... well, priceless, really. I wished I had some kind of image-capturing formation. This was the kind of moment you'd want to preserve for posterity.

""That's..."" He frowned, his magnificent beard twitching with confusion. ""That's not...""

Before he could finish whatever profound observation he was about to make, I caught a flicker of movement. His arm was rising again, rouqi gathering around his hand in a distinctly unfriendly way.

*""Time for the next part of the show,""*¬†I told Han Renyi, who had at least stopped panicking long enough to be curious about what would happen next.

I stepped off the branch and rose higher into the air, floating with deliberate casualness above the Ancestor Tree. In this world, true flight was a Tier 5 ability. Just by doing this, I was making a very specific statement about my supposed power level.

The Ancestor's attack dissipated as his jaw dropped open. ""Tier... Tier 5?"" he whispered, then shook his head violently. ""No, impossible! This must be some trick!""

‚ÄúSeventh Ancestor, no‚Äî‚Äù the Sect Master‚Äôs words were cut off as the old man gathered more rouqi, this time with a distinct fiery edge to it.

Ah, right ‚Äì Tier 4 cultivators could use multiple elements. That could have been problematic if I hadn't already prepared my trump card.

Before the Ancestor could launch his attack, the tree beneath me came to life.

Now, when I say ""came to life,"" I don't mean it just moved or swayed. I mean every branch, every leaf, every root suddenly awakened with the kind of enthusiasm you'd expect from someone who'd just discovered coffee after a century-long nap.

The Ancestor barely had time to widen his eyes before a branch thicker than his torso slammed into him with all the subtlety of an angry mountain. He went flying through the air in a graceful arc that ended rather ungracefully through several walls.

The Sect Master‚Äôs face was doing fascinating things as he processed what he'd just witnessed. I could practically see the thoughts racing through his mind: Not only was I apparently Tier 5 (impossible in this age), but I was also a formation master (explaining the disabled barriers), and now the Ancestor's Tree ‚Äì the very symbol of their sect's power ‚Äì had just betrayed them to side with an outsider.

The Ancestor slowly emerged from the rubble, his beard slightly askew but otherwise looking remarkably intact for someone who'd just been used as impromptu demolition equipment.

I decided it was time to twist the knife a little.

""A Tier 4 junior seeking death?"" I let my voice carry just the right amount of disdain to remind him of the vast gulf in our supposed cultivation levels.

Then, in what might be the most impressive technique I'd seen yet, his entire demeanor transformed. The rage vanished, replaced by a grandfatherly smile that probably worked wonders on junior disciples. He even managed to make brushing debris from his robes look dignified.

""This junior,"" he said, dropping to his knees and pressing his forehead to the ground in a formal kowtow, ""begs forgiveness from the honored senior for his grievous offense.""

When I didn't immediately reduce him to ash, he raised his head slightly. Seeing that he was still alive, he seemed to gain a bit of confidence.

""In fact,"" he continued, performing a second kowtow, ""I must express my deepest shame at my grandson's unfilial behavior. Zhou Shentong was... problematic.""

A third kowtow followed. ""Always causing trouble for the sect...""

Fourth kowtow. ""Constantly embarrassing the family...""

Fifth kowtow. ""Making unreasonable demands of other clans...""

By the sixth kowtow, he was really getting into it, his forehead practically wearing a groove in the stone as he listed every possible flaw his grandson had possessed. According to his new opinion, Zhou Shentong had been responsible for everything from failed harvests to bad weather.

The seventh and final kowtow was his most elaborate yet, his long beard sweeping the ground as he pressed himself lower than I would have thought possible for someone his age. Seven kowtows did feel appropriate coming from the Seventh Ancestor.

""This junior humbly requests the honored senior's guidance,"" he finished, maintaining his prostrate position.

Beside him, the Sect Master‚Äôs expression practically cried: ""Thank the heavens the old fool isn't going to get us all killed.""

As the Ancestor stayed on his knees and continued his impressive retrospective revision of his grandson's character, I reflected on how we'd gotten here. Despite what Han Renyi might have thought, this hadn't been nearly as reckless as it appeared.

The plan had been simple, really.

Use the Shroud rune to hide my identity while letting just enough of that distinctly unfriendly red sun energy seep through. Not enough to reveal its true nature, but enough to make them think I might be something they really didn't want to deal with ‚Äì a powerful demonic rouqin.

It was probably the same in every world, Demonic cultivators had a certain‚Ä¶reputation. Most sects would rather avoid offending one, if only because their revenge usually involved creative uses of human anatomy and a complete disregard for collateral damage.

But I hadn't relied solely on intimidation. That wouldn‚Äôt have been enough, especially since I wasn't sure what would happen if I died here. Was there a loop for time to reset? Would Han Renyi stay dead? Not the kind of questions I wanted to find out.

No, what had really made this work was the sect's specialization. Had they focused on any other element, I would have advised the Han family to relocate immediately while I bought them time. A Tier 3 cultivator was roughly equivalent to someone in the early Elemental Realm, and I knew exactly how that fight would end.

But wood style? That I could work with.

The first thing I'd done upon arriving was disable their barrier formations. They weren't particularly complex ‚Äì most Level 2 formation practitioners could have managed it, though perhaps not as quietly.

Then I'd sensed it ‚Äì the massive tree at the sect's heart. Even without actively using my qi, I could feel it calling to me. Azure had suggested it might recognize the World Tree Sutra's influence, and I wasn't going to argue with him.

During my silent staredown with the Sect Master, I hadn't just been going for the mysterious-intimidating-visitor effect. I'd been carefully feeding qi into the tree, establishing a connection while staying under the sect master's spiritual sense.

The moment I felt the slumbering power within the tree respond, I knew we'd won. Which was why the Ancestor's appearance, while surprising, hadn't been particularly concerning.

*""But what if the tree hadn't responded?""*¬†Han Renyi asked, after I explained my plan to him.

*""Then we would have had a very exciting night involving multiple escape plans, some creative use of explosives, and possibly a brief career as traveling merchants in a distant province.""*

I could feel his exasperation, but at least he wasn't panicking anymore.

My attention returned to the present as I noticed the Ancestor was still talking, having moved on to a detailed criticism of his grandson's choice in women.

The tree's branches twitched questioningly, and both the Sect Master and the Ancestor tensed as they recognized the gesture for what it was ‚Äì an offer to remove these annoying insects.

I reached out and patted the nearest branch. ""Now, now,"" I said casually, ""I'm sure these juniors were about to invite me in to examine their techniques."" I turned my attention fully on them, letting my eyes glow just a bit brighter. ""Isn't that right?""

The two sect leaders shared a quick glance before nodding enthusiastically.

""Of course!"" the Ancestor said quickly, his smile now firmly in please-don't-kill-us territory. ""We juniors would be honored to receive guidance from such an esteemed senior!""

""Master,"" Azure's voice held a note of amusement, ""I believe you're enjoying this performance a bit too much.""

""Can you blame me?"" I replied mentally. ""It's not often I get to watch a higher tier cultivator try to convince me that he definitely wasn't just trying to kill me, and would I perhaps be interested in some tea?""

""Well, just don‚Äôt get too distracted, we seem to have found something very interesting about this world's history.""

He was right. The Ancestor's Tree didn‚Äôt seem to be just any sacred artifact. Its reaction to my qi, the way it had instantly recognized and responded to the World Tree Sutra's influence... this was something older, something that predated the Three-Leaf Clover Sect by a considerable margin.

Which raised some very interesting questions about the Celestial Sovereign, this world's structure, and possibly why everything was slowly falling apart.

The Ancestor was already leading the way toward what appeared to be the sect's main hall, constantly glancing back as if afraid I might disappear ‚Äì or worse, change my mind about not killing him. The Sect Master followed, maintaining a carefully respectful distance while probably trying to figure out how this night had gone so completely sideways.

I floated along behind them, maintaining my air of casual superiority while actually considering our next moves carefully. The immediate crisis was handled ‚Äì between the tree's support and their belief in my power level, the sect wouldn't dare move against the Han family now.

But long-term stability would require more than just fear. These people needed to believe they were getting something valuable out of this arrangement, something worth more than their lost face and dead elder.

""Time to play the mysterious senior who might be willing to share some profound insights,"" I thought, already planning how to leverage their desperation for advancement.

Today I had an active day but felt tired. Had my second cup of coffee and while I sitting just playing games on my phone I started to feel extreme fatigue and like I was gonna pass out. I lied down for a bit. No improvement. Checked my Bp and it was down to 83/53. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I ate some beef jerky and chugged more water. I‚Äôm back at 94/58 and I can stand up now. 

I just switched to a new PCP so waiting for an initial exam with her. But what do I do next? What questions do I ask? Where do I go? I‚Äôm afraid of my Bp dropping too low while I‚Äôm sleeping overnight and having some ischemic attack. ",2,1747609729.0,dysautonomia,0,1.0,False

1kpx22n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kpx22n,hello! [intro and commissions post],"Hello, I'm Xing! I'm a he/him lesbian and I love Asta (Honkai: Star Rail) and Lighter (Zenless Zone Zero)! I'm still pretty new to self-shipping in general, but I do a lot of writing commissions for yumejo/yumedan and would love to offer my services since my schedule cleared up. I know that I get shy about comming people for yume stuff (I only like just got some for myself lol) and would like to reassure I 100% welcome yume comms and love writing them! 

Most of my services can be found in detail on my [VGen](https://vgen.co/cloudlancer)! I also have a separate [writing portfolio](https://cloudcutter.carrd.co/) and my [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/users/chosuiri/works). 

I do mostly fic commissions but I also am open to doing Letter of Encouragement commissions. I've been writing since I was 11 (and I am 24 now) and also roleplay regularly. Characterization and character voice is my personal specialty in writing and I have a lot of fun writing banter. :> as long as I know enough about your dynamic with your f/o I can definitely do my best to bring your scenarios to life!

But please don't worry because I strictly do NOT use genAI to complete any commissions and am greatly against it. I have some slots open and just graduated so a lot of time freed up for me to work on these.

Please let me know if you're interested and we can definitely work something out! My commissions start at **$20 USD** and vary depending on length and if you'd also like some custom formatting to go with it! ",2,1747609466.0,yumejoshis,0,1.0,False

1kpx0ey,https://i.redd.it/0l0ke1erfm1f1.jpeg,My collection,"For years, I‚Äôve had a rather strange hobby‚Äîcollecting paper coffee cups. Some might find it odd, but I genuinely love it. Each cup is a little souvenir, a snapshot of places I‚Äôve visited and coffees I‚Äôve enjoyed. 

Recently, my collection has grown significantly, and organizing it has become quite the challenge. I‚Äôve searched for subreddits dedicated to this niche but, surprisingly, haven‚Äôt found one. So, I‚Äôm hoping this space will become a hub for fellow enthusiasts‚Äîthose who, like me, come back from trips with a couple of empty cups in their bags, excited to add them to their ever-growing collection. 

In a pic you will find a small snippet of my collection.
