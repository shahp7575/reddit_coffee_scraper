We all know why the entire global economy is upside down, unfortunately including the crypto landscape. I'm not naming names and I don't want to share any political opinions here. But what this real estate businessman has shown us in the last 2 months also gives me hope again. Why? He showed us his strategy in no time at all. Big mouth and then crawl back as soon as the big brothers from the global economy get angry and pull him back by the ears.

In view of the history of Mexico/Canada and with a view to the upcoming European Union deadline on April 1, 2025, it is clear to me that the day-of-no-return on April 2, 2025 will also be the start of the altseason for us. 

Once Orange man backs off his threats and makes a deal with world, the whole world will go off like a rocket. BTC ATH in this cycle has already been reached in December 2024 at $109k, so we or simply the entire market will come into play at the same time. At least that is my hope, otherwise we are all heading into a global recession lasting many years. What do you think of my thoughts? Stay strong, hungry and credible.

Imagine a new coffee shop ☕ opens next to your workplace, and for an entire month, they give free, amazing coffee every morning. 🌅 You quickly adapt—it's easy, effortless, comforting. But suddenly, everywhere else feels inconvenient because now, your brain expects that daily dose. 🧠 You didn't ask for it; it just became your new normal.

This is exactly what companies like OpenAI are doing by giving ChatGPT away for free:

* **Step 1 (Free Access 🎁):** They make AI accessible, effortless, and addictive (your daily coffee).
* **Step 2 (Conditioning Users 🔄):** Users become accustomed to instant, AI-enhanced interactions everywhere. They start demanding it because anything less feels frustrating or slow.
* **Step 3 (Pressure & Scale ⚡):** Companies without AI now seem outdated. Customers don't want to interact with companies that don't provide this familiar convenience.
* **Step 4 (Monetizing the Demand 💼):** To stay relevant, big companies are forced to purchase AI services from the very companies that created the original expectation.

Think of the users as leverage. 🕹️ AI companies aren't directly selling products to us—they're **conditioning us to pressure businesses into adopting their technology**. The real customers aren’t individuals; the real money 💰 lies with companies that must satisfy their now-conditioned users.

TL;DR:

**AI companies provide free products 🎯 → Change user expectations 🌀 → Force companies to adopt their tech 🔥 → Profit from large businesses desperate to meet the new normal 💸.**

Imagine a new coffee shop ☕ opens next to your workplace, and for an entire month, they give free, amazing coffee every morning. 🌅 You quickly adapt—it's easy, effortless, comforting. But suddenly, everywhere else feels inconvenient because now, your brain expects that daily dose. 🧠 You didn't ask for it; it just became your new normal.

This is exactly what companies like OpenAI are doing by giving ChatGPT away for free:

* **Step 1 (Free Access 🎁):** They make AI accessible, effortless, and addictive (your daily coffee).
* **Step 2 (Conditioning Users 🔄):** Users become accustomed to instant, AI-enhanced interactions everywhere. They start demanding it because anything less feels frustrating or slow.
* **Step 3 (Pressure & Scale ⚡):** Companies without AI now seem outdated. Customers don't want to interact with companies that don't provide this familiar convenience.
* **Step 4 (Monetizing the Demand 💼):** To stay relevant, big companies are forced to purchase AI services from the very companies that created the original expectation.

This is not the life I imagined for myself. Financial insecurity is my biggest fear and I'm living it. 

I’ve been with my husband for ten years and it feels like we haven't built anything together. He’s significantly older than me, and while we both technically have careers, I’m the only one with a stable income. From the beginning, I (we) envisioned a more traditional dynamic—where my husband would be the provider, I’d work if needed, and together we’d build a life, have children, and share financial security. That was the model I grew up with, and it’s what I always wanted. He did too... 

However, a decade into our marriage, that vision feels completely out of reach. We have no children, my husband is financially unstable (not that he wants but bad business decisions and partners), and I’ve exhausted my own resources trying to sustain both of us. I built my career from the ground up, but along the way, I ended up funding his startup (which he hasn’t even been grateful for), covering our lifestyle, and paying our expenses for an entire year. Now, my savings are gone, and despite everything I’ve contributed, I’m not even on the deed to our home—he bought it before our marriage and still pays the mortgage on his own.


I don’t feel like I’m getting anything out of this marriage. My biological clock is ticking, and I don’t want my husband to be an even older dad if we do have children—but right now, I can’t imagine bringing a child into this situation. He isn’t financially stable, doesn’t have health insurance, savings, investments.... He doesn’t like it but it’s like he doesn’t know how to do any better. 

Then there’s the age difference. While I knew about it going into the relationship, it’s becoming harder to ignore. Physically, he has changed—he’s put on weight and has mobility issues, and at times, I feel like I’m going out with a much older relative. We don't have sex life and if, it's one position for last past years. One. I don't feel wanted, I dont feel desired or sexy near him as he uses pills. That alone makes me feel guilty for even thinking this way, but I can’t help it. Beyond that, our conversations frustrate me. He doesn’t understand me the way I need him to, and he’s slow to grasp things, which only makes me feel more disconnected.

To be fair, when he did have money, he covered trips and household expenses, dinners. But we never combined finances, never had joint accounts, and never shared assets. For many couples, that might be normal, but based on my upbringing, it only reinforces how separate we really are. At the time when I had nothing, I had to ask him for money (for grocery, makeup, dress or other personal expenses) which made me feel resentful since at the end I had to start my business to eventually fund his.  I don't think I can ever get over it. (My dad gave my mom card, there were rules but he shared it so she did not have to ask).

I hate the thought of divorce, but I feel miserable. This isn’t where I thought I’d be in life—nowhere near the “power couple” dynamic I once hoped for. I’m carrying the weight of this relationship financially and emotionally, and in return, all I really get are foot massages and morning coffee. Yes, he’s kind and warm, while I’m more driven , organized and financially responsible (well until I wasn't). But that difference has led to a dynamic where I’m the one holding everything together.

And if I do leave, I walk away with nothing. The house is his, I’m not on the deed, and despite everything I’ve contributed, I wouldn’t get anything in a divorce. In fact, I might even be required to pay him spousal support—though I doubt he’d accept it. The reality is, I have no financial safety net and nowhere to go. I don’t have family to rely on, and I can’t afford to buy a place on my own. 

I don’t know what to do, but I do know I can’t keep living like this… this marriage feel like we don’t have any accomplishments together and we don't build anything ""together"". ",6,1741671000.0,AskWomenOver30,7,0.88,False

Here's the recipe we made today that was very close:

30mL white rum
20mL cream liqueur (we didn't have baileys so used a local coffee cream liqueur)
15mL spiced rum
15mL Cointreau 

30mL orange juice
15-20mL vanilla syrup (like the stuff you'd put in a coffee)

A tiny pinch of salt, cinnamon and fresh nutmeg

Shaken and strained into a martini glass (sadly I didn't take photos, but it also didn't look great)

I was thinking of incorporating the nutmeg and cinnamon into a simple syrup and do 10mL vanilla and 10mL spiced simple.

My friends initially thought that 10mL lemon and 20mL orange was too butter but I really like the lemon flavour as that's very common to have on a crepe.

The other idea I had was a clarified milk punch for that  lovely texture. I have never made milk punch at home so I don't know how the recipe would translate, would I need to make adjustments?

- Shinkansen is easy. Unless you are bringing a trunk(s) for luggage, you can use overhead or have in front of you. No need for the oversized luggage area.
- Put the Suica on your phone wallet. You will use everywhere.
- Don’t get hung up on all the etiquette discussions — saw all forms of dress (no one seemed to care, just don’t be obscene), people walked in all directions, you can eat near stalls, no problem carrying around a coffee, etc. just be a responsible, courteous person (no jackassery - which you shouldn’t do anywhere honestly).
- Take care of your feet. Soak them at night. I had nice ACISC shoes - still hurt bad by end of day. Be shoe smart. Comfort, not style.
- If you are a foodie trying to get into popular restaurants-make reservations well in advance before traveling, especially Tokyo. We weren’t able to get in most places/even make reservations a few days out. 
- Benches are few and far between. You will be standing/walking all day.
- Finally, there does seem to be bug going around Tokyo - I got sick, lots of masks out. I started wearing mine. Bring some cold meds with you. Update: I realize mask wearing is prevalent in Japan.

So me and a lot of my coworkers will go there a lot to get coffee etc. 

I normally get a coffee either before or after my shift. There’s this guy who works there however I can’t help but notice and have a crush on. He looks to be around my age? Ever since I met him he’s given me free stuff, he lets me skip the line sometimes, and normally gives me my coffee for free. No other employee there does this. The one day my coworker texts me and says there was some guy at the cafe who asked about me and described him. She said he must have recognized her uniform and he asked if I was working and if I was he wanted to give her my normal coffee order to give to me. Idk he could be nice and just doing his job but him going out of his way and asking about me kinda makes me wonder?

I don’t talk to him much, the place is always super busy so it’s normally just some quick small talk so I don’t hold up the line. I normally just buy my coffee and leave. but now I’m wondering if I should maybe try and make a move? I’m honestly super interested and he seems really sweet but at the same time asking someone out at their job feels kinda bad. And maybe he really is just trying to be nice.

They are one of those people who I have watched grow and change over time and I’m so incredibly proud of them for overcoming everything and becoming someone so beautiful.

I remember how still the world was when we were together. I know it’s weird but my world made so much sense when I was with them. Even when I see them now for those little moments.

Did you know many people look for a quick fix for weight loss? Some try body wraps. But can body wraps and weight loss really go together? I will talk about body wraps in this article. I will explain what they are. I will see if they work. Also, I will tell you about the good and bad things about them. I want to give you correct information. So, you can understand body wraps better. It's like I am helping you understand my engineering concepts, but for weight loss!

What are Body Wraps? An Overview
--------------------------------

Body wraps are like a blanket for your body. But instead of wool, you use cloths and creams. They put the cream on you. Then, they wrap you up. People have used them a long time. Some use mud. Some use herbs. They say it helps you slim down. You can get them at spas. Or, you can buy a kit to do it at home. They are supposed to make your skin better. And, they are thought to help with weight loss.

The Claim: Do Body Wraps *Really* Work for Weight Loss?
-------------------------------------------------------

Do body wraps really help with weight loss? This is the big question. They say you lose inches. They say it removes bad things from your body. They say it makes your skin tight. But, mostly, you just lose water. Not real fat. There is not much proof they help you lose weight for a long time. So, do not think it is a magic trick. It is important to know this.

How Body Wraps are Marketed for Weight Loss: Understanding the Mechanisms
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Detoxification Claims: Separating Fact from Fiction

People say body wraps remove toxins. The body is supposed to remove toxins naturally. The liver and kidneys do this. So, body wraps removing toxins is usually wrong. I think this is very important to understand. The body has its own engineering to remove toxins. It usually does not need help from body wraps.

### Temporary Inch Loss: The Role of Dehydration and Compression

Body wraps make you sweat. You lose water when you sweat. This makes you look smaller for a little while. Like when a balloon loses air. But you did not lose fat. You only lost water. When you drink again, the inches come back. It is temporary.

Other Potential Benefits of Body Wraps (Besides Weight Loss)
------------------------------------------------------------

### Skin Hydration and Exfoliation: Improving Skin Texture and Appearance

Body wraps sometimes have good things for your skin. They can make your skin soft. They can help remove dead skin. This can make your skin look better. Some people think it helps with cellulite, too. But this is just on the outside. It only helps your skin look good for some time.

### Relaxation and Stress Reduction: Promoting Overall Well-being

Getting a body wrap can feel good. It is like going to a spa. It can help you relax. When you relax, you do not feel as stressed. This can be good for your health. Stress can make it hard to lose weight. So, relaxing helps. This is like fixing a machine. You need to take care of it.

Potential Risks and Side Effects of Body Wraps
----------------------------------------------

### Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance: Staying Safe and Hydrated

Body wraps can make you sweat a lot. When you sweat, you lose water. You can get dehydrated. This is bad. You need to drink water before, during, and after. This will help you stay safe. You can also lose electrolytes. Electrolytes are like the battery for your body.

At-Home Body Wraps for Weight Loss: DIY Options and Recipes
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Popular Ingredients for DIY Body Wraps: Coffee, Seaweed, and Clay

You can make body wraps at home. I think many people do. You can use coffee grounds. You can use seaweed. You can use clay. Mix it together. Put it on your body. Wrap yourself up. Then, wash it off. I think this is fun to try.

Conclusion
----------

Body wraps can make you lose water. They can make your skin feel nice. But they do not help you lose weight forever. To lose weight, you need to eat healthy. You need to exercise. It is like building a strong building. It takes time and effort. If you want to lose weight, talk to a doctor. Body wraps can be a nice thing to do for your skin. But do not think they will make you thin.

## The Allure of the Grind and Brew: Why Freshly Ground Coffee Matters

Before we delve into specific models, let's address the essential question: why bother with a grind and brew coffee maker at all? the answer lies in the power of freshness. Coffee beans,once ground,begin to release their volatile aromatic compounds. These compounds, responsible for the rich, complex flavors and delightful aroma we associate with great coffee, quickly degrade when exposed to air and light. Grinding your beans immediately before brewing preserves these precious flavors, resulting in a noticeably richer, more vibrant cup of coffee compared to using pre-ground varieties.For true coffee enthusiasts, the difference is undeniable. An automatic coffee maker with grinder is the convenient way to enjoy this freshness daily.

I (25F) have a boyfriend (27M) and we have been together since 2022.
I had a job (he doesn’t) when we started dating. There are times that I'll pay for our date (since he doesn't have money yet but will pay me back when he does) and sometimes I shoulder all the expenses even tho he doesn't want me to pay for it. It's not that I have more it's just that I am more of a ""giver"" person. He is my first boyfriend so I'm all in. 
We have been together for 9 months when he finally got a job. I was very happy for him. Finally, he will not feel like he's nothing compared to me. (Idk why he feels that way) after that, time flies so fast. Our relationship was so solid and so strong to the point that my friends were jealous of it (in a good way. They wanted a relationship like mine) 
Fast forward to 1 day before our first anniversary. I was in his room. He was sleeping beside me when I got this feeling of being bored and curious. I picked up his phone to take pictures when suddenly someone inside my brain said: ""Open it"". I never touched his phone or even checked his social media or what. I trust him. First, I opened his Facebook, then Messenger. All the messages were from his friends and family. When I'm about to close it I accidentally tap the menu button where you can see the switch profile button so I clicked it. 
There I saw another account. My heart was beating so fast but I managed to remain calm. So I opened the account and there I saw all of her ""flings"" There was a conversation with girls (many girls) saying that he wanted to meet up. He asked them to have coffee with him and he even said ""I miss you love"" to someone, so meaning they saw each other already. I cried and my sobbing woke him up. He asked me what was wrong but I couldn't answer him. I breathed deeply and composed myself i just handed him his phone and said; ""Why?"" There were tons of words inside my head but all I said was ""Why"" he didn't answer me. I immediately got all my belongings and booked a grab to go home.  He was standing at my back punching the gate and asking me to stay but I refused. 
I went home and cried all day. Really? 1 day before our 1st anniversary? Then our anniversary came. It was 12:02 am when I received a message from him saying ""Mahal na mahal kita"" When I saw that I cried. I love him so much. I replied ""ayusin natin?"" When he saw my reply he immediately called me. He was crying. We were both crying. We fixed our relationship and tried to move forward. Every time I felt suspicious or had anxieties, he would always assure me and comfort me. He felt sorry all the time and I also felt sorry for forgiving him and promising him to move forward but eventually brought up the issue everything im having anxiety. 
I'm not this kind of person. I'm not easily jealous  and I don't overthink a lot. I even let him go on a vacation with his girl bestie (just the two of them) for two weeks. I let him go to parties and sometimes a one-on-one drink with his other girl besties and it's okay. But after what he did, I still let him do all of that but my mind was killing me and drove me crazy ",2,1741669134.0,cheatingexposed,0,1.0,False

## Stanley: The Rugged Icon

Stanley has a long and storied history, dating back to 1913 when William Stanley Jr. invented the all-steel vacuum bottle. Originally designed for outdoor adventurers and blue-collar workers,Stanley products are renowned for their ruggedness and reliability.

*   **18/8 Stainless Steel Construction:** Guarantees durability and prevents rust.*   **Hammertone Green Finish (Classic Models):** The iconic green finish is a signature element of Stanley's design.
* **Flowstate Tumbler:** the *stanley quencher vs hydro flask* debate frequently enough focuses on the popular Flowstate Tumbler, known for its large capacity and comfortable handle.
*   **Variety of Lids and Handles:** Many Stanley bottles feature integrated handles and a range of lid options. Investigating *stanley lid* options reveals a focus on practical designs.
*   **different Series:** Adventure, Classic, and IceFlow series provide a tiered approach regarding features, price and durability.
*   **Sizes:** *Stanley sizes* vary depending on the specific product.

*   **Classic, Rugged Aesthetic:** The vintage-inspired designs appeal to those who appreciate a more utilitarian look.

## Head-to-Head: A detailed *Hydro Flask vs Stanley Comparison*

Now, let's get down to a side-by-side evaluation of the two brands across various categories.

### 1. Temperature Retention: The Ultimate Test

Both Hydro Flask and Stanley excel at keeping drinks cold and hot. However, in controlled tests, Hydro Flask often edges out Stanley in terms of *ice test*. Hydro Flask's TempShield insulation consistently delivers slightly longer-lasting temperature retention. That being said, the difference is often marginal and may not be noticeable in everyday use.

**Verdict:** hydro Flask wins by a slim margin.

### 2. Durability: Built to Last a lifetime?

Stanley's reputation for unmatched durability is well-deserved. Their bottles are designed to withstand harsh conditions and heavy use. While Hydro Flasks are durable, they are not as resistant to dents and scratches. Many consider *stanley quality* as being one of ruggedness, as opposed to sleekness.

**Verdict:** Stanley takes the crown for durability.

### 3.Design and Aesthetics: Style Matters

Hydro Flask's sleek, modern design and vibrant color options give it a distinct advantage in this category. While Stanley has updated its designs in recent years, its aesthetic is generally more utilitarian. People looking for a blend of fashion and function will likely prefer Hydro Flask.

**Verdict:** Hydro Flask wins for design and aesthetics.

### 4. Portability: On the Go?

Hydro Flask bottles tend to be lighter and more compact, making them easier to carry around. Stanley bottles,particularly the larger models,can be bulky and heavy. For activities where weight and space are a concern, such as hiking or backpacking, Hydro Flask is often the better choice. If looking for something that fits in the car cup holder, comparing the *stanley adventure vs hydro flask* dimensions is critically important.

**Verdict:** Hydro Flask is more portable.

### 5. Price: Value for your Money

generally, Stanley bottles are more affordable than comparable Hydro Flask models. If price is a major factor in your decision, Stanley offers excellent value for money. Checking for a *hydro flask coupon* or a *stanley coupon* can help.

**Verdict:** Stanley is more budget-friendly.

### 6. Lid Options and Accessories: Customization is Key

Hydro Flask offers a wider variety of lids and accessories than Stanley. From straw lids to flex caps, you can easily customize your Hydro Flask to suit your specific needs.**Verdict:** Hydro Flask offers more customization options.

### 7. Warranty: Peace of Mind

Hydro Flask offers a limited lifetime warranty against manufacturer defects. Stanley also offers a lifetime warranty on many of its products. Both warranties offer peace of mind, protecting you from unexpected failures.

**verdict:** Tie. Both brands offer excellent warranty coverage.[[Explore Top Rated hydro flask vs stanley on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/hidratespark/?kw=hydro flask vs stanley)

1j8j5s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501Canada/comments/1j8j5s0/fighting_divisive_propaganda_and_standing_in/,Fighting divisive propaganda and standing in Solidarity,"Good evening all,

Many of you have read my morale posts and know that I believe in full honesty and transparency. I have never been one to sugar coat things but always do my best to speak with respect and teat others with dignity. Tonight is no different, I will be open and honest in addressing a serious issue creeping into our fight in solidarity. So once again, grab something to drink or even a snack while you sit down and read. F

I had a conversation with a couple good friends of mine today and we could not help but talk about what is happening. Although this in and of itself doesn't sound unusual, what made it different was the fact that none of us lived in the same country. One of my friends lives in the UK (southern part), another in Canada (out of respect and privacy I don't state what province), and me being the only American in the group. Usually we joke an banter with one another and even make jokes about our differences as good friends tend to do. (These same friends would call me on the 4th of July and jokingly state ""happy treasonous colonist day"" before wishing me a happy independence day. For my friend in Canada, I have actually set the calendar in my phone to wish him a happy thanksgiving since it differs from ours. It's that close a friendship between all of us.) As happens from time to time there was a slight lull in the conversation. However, there was something much different this time, and my friends could tell, there was something very wrong. Which lead to us discussing the current situation with the American government and the weight it has placed on the shoulders of both Americans and Canadians.

I explained what many Americans are seeing when visiting other subs, and that is divisive rhetoric and hatred. I have lost count how many times I've been told Americans are not doing enough, that we should all be in the streets rioting and destroying everything in our wake. I have seen people posting comparative pictures which were manipulated as to shape a harmful narrative. The example I will provide is a picture of a Tesla dealership in Chicago which has a line of police officers standing outside and no one else nearby. That picture was cropped to only show the officers, so you will not see the protests that were right around the corner. It does not show the protesters across the street from the dealership, and intentionally omits the massive protest that marched through the streets nearby not long before the Tesla protest occurred. **All** of which were **peaceful,** and the police presence was to both ensure the safety of the protestors and the property. While this lone image I discussed doesn't seem like much, it is causing damage, because it is not a single image. It is a campaign intended to sow the seeds of hate and division. It is part of the regimes propaganda. Seeds which are sprouting at an alarming rate, and I fear will bloom.

We discussed how the propaganda is creating echo chambers, the very same echo chambers which lead to the rise of the orange stain on our democracy, and threatens your sovereignty. I see the Reddit algorithms attempting to show me Canadian subs it thinks are relevant to keep my attention. Some were very interesting, and others engaging, which is part of what lead me here to start, others, well they are not my cup of coffee, and that's okay, I'm not the audience for that sub. So you may be asking, what does this have to do with the propaganda and seeds of hate? My reply is everything!

You see some of those subs have been around for a while, even years, and now there is a larger audience attempting understand exactly what is happening and how we can stand in solidarity. Some of these people may have barely used Reddit, if at all, until recently and now they are seeking answers to a world that is absolutely foreign and the original playbook has been ripped from their hands, torn to pieces, then thrown in a shredder before being burned. That is what we Americans are experiencing right now, and that is why we are seeking answers, and apologizing for what is happening. It is why you hear Americans state we didn't vote for the orange stain, because we need to make it clear we do not support the fascists. In return, they get a metaphorical punch to the face and spit upon, then told they are expecting to be coddled by reaching out to ask questions and show Canadians they want to support your country. Only then to hear we are not doing enough to protect Canada before being kicked when they are down. Even worse is when I see these people who claim to be Canadian (**Note:** I intentionally use the word claim because I am not certain it they are legitimately Canadian or not) attempt to demonstrate the same behaviors in subs which are intended to unify us. These bad faith actors intentionally or otherwise are sowing the seeds of hatred which directly support the fascist regime. They continue to say that Americans are not doing enough, because we haven't resorted to an all out Revolution or Civil War. (**Note: I had a person who claimed to be Canadian go so far as to tell me our Constitution is a farce in the 50501 sub today because her personal views regarding our founding fathers.**)

To make clear, why Americans are exhausting every nonviolent method at our disposal and refusing to escalate to that level, a level that will cause irreparable harm to the North American continent, I present a part of our Deceleration of Independence (I am including the link to read it in full for anyone interested)

[""When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world""](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript)

As you read above, separating the colonies from the British Empire was not something they were taking lightly, and only when they exhausted every peaceful and nonviolent measure available did they make a final deceleration. We have not reached that point and we will do everything in our power to prevent it from reaching that level.

So I ask my Canadian brothers and sisters, and all my fellow Americans to stand up against this rise of hate. Speak out against this rise of divisive rhetoric towards the American people and redirect it to the proper recipient, the fascists who threaten both our nations.

1j8j579,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1j8j579/too_curious/,Too Curious,"What am I doing? There is no medal for being this diligent of an achivist.

I should have left it alone, stopped reading. I should have gone home, cracked open a beer, and watched the Knicks suck some more. I know now that some stories are meant to be forgotten, sealed away in folders to gather dust. But I am curious, too curious, and I kept digging.

At first, I told myself it was just research. An old habit. I’ve always had a thing for the little inconsistencies in official reports, or files buried so deep it felt like someone wanted them lost. Sometimes it’s nothing, a clerical error, a typo, or someone just got a little too high. But then there are the other cases. The ones that don’t make sense no matter which way you look at them. Have you ever seen a report where every witness’ statement contradicts itself? One report claimed it was pouring rain; another swore the pavement was dry. In a recording, the same witness described being followed by a tall well-dressed man, then minutes later, by a short woman in a Jets jersey. Reports that change every time I read them… as if someone was live editing. I thought I was losing my mind.

The first time I found one of those, I laughed it off. A hoax, maybe. A weird oversight. I threw it on my discard pile. Then I found another. And another. Different cities, different years, different circumstances but the same kind of changes and inconsistencies—like pieces of something bigger.

I should’ve stopped. I see that now.

It wasn’t until things started happening to me that I realized I wasn’t just looking at the files. Someone, something was looking back.

I started noticing small things at first. A blueish glow under the front door to the hallway, the clacking of my old typewriter in the closet, a flicker on my laptop screen—not the usual glitch, but something more intentional, like a frame skipping in a movie. The kind that makes you wonder if you actually saw something or if your brain filled in the blanks.

Then came the phone calls. I’d answer, and the line would be dead for a moment before a faint clicking sound started, rhythmic, deliberate. Once, I swear I heard breathing before the call disconnected.

I barely sleep anymore. Yesterday, my apartment door was locked from the inside when I knew I left it open. My neighbor, an older guy who barely notices anything, told me someone was standing outside my door last night.

Then today, I got myself a coffee and when I got back to my desk my laptop flickered again. A message typed itself.

*""Are you really ready to see?""*

I didn’t type that. It creeped me out and I don’t feel safe anymore.

I shut the laptop. Left my apartment. Walked three blocks in the rain just to convince myself the world was still normal. It’s not.

I don’t know what’s coming next, but I think I’ve already gone too far.

I need to know—has anyone else seen things like this? Not stories—real things. Patterns that don’t make sense. Files that shouldn’t exist. People who vanish in ways that don’t fit the reports.

If you have, tell me. Because I don’t want to be alone anymore.  
If I’m not the only one seeing these patterns, maybe it’s time I share the files. Should I?

Mantras playing while asleep have significantly made me more confident. and reduced the hold massively my subconsious (inner critic) has on me in a very short amound of time. Wud strongly recommend for yall. Sounds like heeby jeeby nonesense but geniually worked for me. (As a heads up am on coffee which significantly reduces cptad symptoms bc of adhd.)


(Long version for those who want more context:) I'm not even joking when I say in 5 days of playing positive nighttime mantras I was able to develop significant strides in confidence. I'm more social, more direct, and more assertive and its unreal how quick the progress has been happening. It's completely shaped my life around. I do wanna warn my cptsd is significantly reduced because of me drinking coffee. But I still find it insane 4 days ago the negativity of my subconscious made me feel like I was a failure no matter how hard I thought. And now its barely even a bleep. While this might not be a cure all to CPTSD it's significantly helped me and I wanted to leave this advice here as Ik yall suffer a lot more then anyone could ever imagine and thought it might help. 

I think its because of something to do with the subconscious internalizing mantras easier at night. Plus since ur not awake it'll be a lot harder to feel the extreme discomfort and pushbacks cptsd probably puts yall through when yall do try this shit during the day.

  
Ik while mantras are effective they can be a nightmare. Even while my symptoms were significantly regulated because of coffee. I geniually despised daytime mantras even when I would play them in video form because it always felt like I was fighting myself and the process was agonizing. But I swear on it. I've experienced real goddamn change. In such little time it feels like a dream. Please if you got a chance give it a try. No harm done. For the next couple days a week or two. Put on some headphones before you go to sleep. Find a 8 hour long mantra video of your choice. Confidence, self love. Whatever. And fall asleep too it. I'm confident it'll help significantly.

Dear (Agent),

I’ve had the pleasure of following (your social media) account recently. I resonated with (your mentions with specifics). I'm proud to offer my standalone urban fantasy novel, EX LIBRIS. Complete at 81,000 words, this book is perfect for fans of Terry Pratchett and Drew Hayes.

Small-town librarian Ezra Kareem is happy to be left alone with his books, thank you very much. But one rainy night, two strangers appear on his doorstep: a woman named Prima, who claims to be the embodiment of his favorite book of fairytales from childhood; and a demon hunting her down to access her magic. When one of Prima’s spells goes horribly wrong, her pages — and her memories — scatter to the winds.

Ezra would be happy to leave Prima to her own devices until he discovers that her pages contain the one thing he desperately wants: memories of his own mother, which mysteriously vanished from his mind upon her death. But the stories have taken on lives of their own, enchanting his small seaside town and bringing fairytales to life across the Monterey Bay peninsula. An otter king guards an evil relic deep in a forest of kelp; a runaway prince sleeps in the shark-filled tanks of the Monterey Bay Aquarium; and a secret society of crows face off against the brutal republic of seagulls, all vying for Prima's enchanted pages. Together, Prima and Ezra must race the demon to collect all of Prima’s pages and solve the mystery of Ezra's mother if Ezra has any hope of returning to his quiet librarian’s life.

First 300 Words:

Ezra Karim sank into the soft recliner with book in hand. It was a perfect evening for reading. Darkness draped over his cottage, but inside, the fire crackled merrily in the hearth. A cup of ginger tea steeped to his right. He slipped into the first lines of the text with a pleasant sigh.

A knock pulled him from his reverie. For a moment he considered leaving the door unanswered, but then the knock came again, more insistent. He struggled out of his recliner and crossed the small living room to the front door.

His neighbor Edith stood in the cool evening holding a plastic-wrapped plate of cookies. “Evening, Ezra.” She gave him her usual grin: cheery, wrinkles deepening in a smile that showed off her overly white dentures. “Hope I didn’t catch you at a bad time.”

“Oh, well…” He tried to ease himself across the door frame even as she squeezed past him into the living room. “I was just trying to –”

“Reading, I see.” She glanced at the book face-down on the recliner: *Notes from Underground* by Dostoyevsky. “So it is a good time, then?” She set the cookies on the coffee table before his small couch, which these days hardly ever got any use. “What’s a young man like you doing reading Dostoyevsky?”

“I’m not that young.”

“Thirty-something is pretty young in my book.” She lifted the plastic wrap from around the plate of cookies. “Just made these fresh, I know you like chocolate chip.”

“Thank you,” he said. He didn’t like chocolate chip. Why didn’t people just leave them out and make it simple? Cookies were fine without the gooey messy stuff in the middle. And don’t even get him started on nuts. “If you don’t mind, Edith, I –”

“Oh, I see you have tea. Mind pouring a cup for an old lady?” She sat on the couch and took a cookie from under the plastic.",1,1741668475.0,PubTips,1,0.67,False

Practically, though, my circumstances leave me relatively limited in the spaces I can occupy. I can’t go to a coffee shop. I get insecure, squeamish even, around that subset of individuals with actual work to do, people with jobs. Not to mention, my table manners are abysmal, I’ve always got a foot up on the chair or something similarly undignified. 

At the library, there’ll always be a guy standing outside to harass you about voting or petitions and it’s really not something I have any patience for. They really don’t know what they’re doing, approaching me with that stuff. I’m the product of a normie CNN lib, “they’re literal nazis” mom and a Steve Bannon fancam father. My politics are, accordingly, regarded. 

This is how I end up at the mall in the year 2025. First, I decide to walk down to the movie theater to fill up my water bottle with that perfect crunchy ice that nicely satisfies my pagophagic cravings, which are secondary to an underlying—no, not anemia—just a manifestation of your garden variety oral fixation in a girl without a more, well, productive outlet for such impulses. I walk past a pimply teenage boy with wire rim glasses wearing an absolutely monstrous black leather collar—the thing is garnished with leather spikes that really drive the point home, I think. He’s walking alongside this girl-obese, but, in fairness, otherwise fairly inoffensive in appearance—with, yes, leash in hand. There’s an elderly man wearing—improbably, I know, but I promise I’m not making this up—cat ear headphones— turning to kiss a much younger asian woman. What a touching scene— I would cast these two instantly in a Cialis advertisement, if I had a say in such things. To my right, a visibly homeless man is watching Dave Ramsey YouTube shorts off a screen so cracked the edges are starting to peel up. An unfamiliar feeling sets in—I’ve never felt so sure—yes, this is where I really belong.

Like girl, I know it’s you. I know you trying to leave me stranded and make me work from open to close. 

I initially was going to post this to be a funny anecdote on my other social medias but it really got me thinking…

I fully understand it’s ultimately not the coworker’s fault, it’s management for not staffing the joint properly. But working from 5:30 AM to nearly 8 PM was EXHAUSTING.  and before anyone says “yes but nurses work 12s, stop whining” Yes I know that. But that’s the shift they are literally hired for going in. Often 3 days of 12 hours each and then 2 days off, from what I’ve heard from my nurse pals. I’m not saying I had it worse,or nurses don’t deserve praise, or nurses are (insert whatever insult here). I’m just stating my experience. It was exhausting.

Ultimately what this all boils down to is I hate power structures. Like, the fact the hospital I worked at to allow staff to be pitted against each other during COVID???  While simultaneously putting up signs about “we’re all in this together” while furloughing half your staff because… well I STILL don’t even know, nearly 5 years later. Literally heard a couple of nurses talking about whether or not a job like mine was “essential” WHILE I was serving them coffee. The system wants us to argue and look down on one another. While we scrounge for crumbs, the big guys feast. In a word… capitalism.

1j8iwbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NightEatingSyndrome/comments/1j8iwbk/just_learned_of_the_syndrome_but_have_had_it_for/,"Just learned of the syndrome, but have had it for several years","Update: just ordered a used hard copy of ""https://www.amazon.com/Night-Eating-Syndrome-Assessment-Treatment-ebook/dp/B009FZ6Z1O/"" , a 2012 scholarly compilation and the latest book on the subject on Amazon. We will see if it helps.

My symptoms started over 6 years ago and at that time were attributable to Zyprexa, or so we (my psychiatrist and I) thought. I was on Zyprexa for bipolar I, it worked very well, but caused extreme weight gain.

Naltrexone and Topiramate did not help alleviate nighttime eating syndrome. I would wake up from painful, imperative hunger and need to eat a whole meal to get back to sleep. Hunger pangs were truly awful. My mind did not want to eat. In other words, I had only hunger but no appetite.

In late 2021, I was put on Ozempic and began strength training. Initially, I ate much less, and all nighttime hunger was gone. Later, however, it returned, although the quantities I needed to eat were lesser.

Overall, three approaches probably contributed to weight loss and being toned: Ozempic, then Mounjaro instead; an exercise program which eventually expanded beyond strength training; going off of Zyprexa and replacing it with medications that are less offensive in the weight gain department. Ultimately I lost 45 pounds and now am a stable weight I can live with. I am a woman with waist/hip ratio of 0.8, so it is not too bad, and I have fitting clothes now.

At some point, my nighttime hunger stopped and all I needed in the middle of the night was some moist fruit and maybe a cup of plain kefir, but even that, not always. So it seemed that I was consuming liquid for comfort. Then nighttime hunger returned. I now wake up once or twice, rarely three times, and have to eat. I tried not eating, but could not go back to sleep. I tried many times. It is impossible to go back to sleep.

I see a dietitian on telehealth about twice a year and am on messaging with her between appointments. She made a recommendation that helped: instead of drinking my calories and protein (Fairlife milk shake with 42 g of protein, or Fairlife milk, or plain kefir), I now eat them. Typically it is plain greek yogurt with berries or peach slices (I warm frozen peach slices in the microwave), and unsalted nuts, and if that is not enough, apple slices with crunchy peanut butter, or steelcut oatmeal cooked with collagen peptides for extra protein, plus a little Gravenstein apple sauce and cinnamon powder. If that is not enough, I drink plain kefir and eat whole rye crackers.

When I travel, I send protein shakes to the hotel and pack nuts and single-serving Greek yogurt containers in my suitcase.

I cannot take Zoloft because of the risk of mania, and it does not make sense to try Zoloft for this syndrome because I am not depressed. My mood is stable and I do not have intraday mood fluctuations.

Naltrexone 50 mg did not help and I stopped it because it caused depression. That was in 2019. Recently I restarted Naltrexone at 25 mg and it does not cause depression, but rather is helpful for my mood (makes me less creative in a good way). I like it. But it did nothing to NES.

I tried Topiramate for NES several times. I did not help. I stopped it because I started forgetting words, a typical side effect.

I have never had addictions.

My daily diet contains enough protein, fiber, and fat. Mostly I eat home-cooked meals, with lots of soups (mirepoix, olive oil, leafy greens, beans or meat - good stuff). I have not tried Keto.

I also consume enough water during the day. I am not dehydrated.

I have a sleep apnea machine and using or not using it makes no difference in terms of hunger.

I have both sleep onset insomnia and suspected hypersomnia (hypersomnia started after COVID 2.5 years ago). Or maybe it is narcolepsy type II. I will eventually be tested in a sleep lab to determine which diagnosis I have.

This is not a willpower or cravings issue. I do not know what having a craving feels like. I do not want to eat and would rather sleep and not eat, but the hunger is ""imperative"" and commands me to eat. Sometimes it is so uncomfortable that eating food cold feels impossible. Then I microwave high protein Fairlife milk or frozen berries or fruit and consume them warm.

I am a non-diabetic who wears a CGM and tracks glucose with the Levels app. My average daily glucose fluctuates around 100. I have not been able to see if glucose impacts nighttime hunger. I have not been able to identify triggers, either. Nothing seems to correlate, and it is just very rarely that I sleep through the night without eating. Then I feel great the day after.

What can I try that I have not already tried? Should I engage a dietitian on a weekly basis, who might help adjust the diet more than the one I see infrequently? I have contacted an eating disorders program and they are keen on putting me in their virtual outpatient therapy group with binge eaters, but my psychiatrist is dubious, since I do not binge eat, do not make myself feel uncomfortably full, do not feel out of control, and do not dissociate.

If I receive the diagnosis of hypersomnia, I will be put on a trial of sodium oxybate which might consolidate nighttime sleep. I am hopeful that the medication can help me sleep through the night, but it will be a while until, and if, I get access to it. Sodium oxybate is a tightly controlled substance and only the sleep medicine doctor can prescribe it after the diagnosis is confirmed.

The only medication being faulted for nighttime eating now is Seroquel, but I take it in very small doses—sometimes just 25 mg a night—and still wake up hungry.

The psychiatrist thinks this might have developed due to Pavlovian conditioning. But how do I break the cycle? If I do not eat, I cannot fall asleep.

When I eat, I do not feel compulsion. I feel physical discomfort in the esophagus area. In the past, I felt pain in the stomach area. How I feel now is less painful, but still I cannot go back to sleep while I feel that discomfort.

I recently went from 12.5 to 15 mg Mounjaro (the highest dose). It does not help.

I cannot take Trazodone for sleep instead of Seroquel because Trazodone stopped working years ago. Seroquel works well.

I take 300 mcg of Melatonin about 5 hours before intended bedtime, as advised by my CBT-I psychologist.

I drink 2, rarely 3 lattes in the morning. I do not drink coffee after 12 PM. I am unusual in that I can drink a latte and immediately take a nap if I feel underslept. Coffee never wakes me up. Same for Nuvigil and Provigil - they did nothing for hypersomnia when I tried them. Getting morning sunlight does not help, either.

I'm gonna lay down some foundation that I personally think will have some relevance later in my tale of woe. Don't lie, we all like backstory.
My partner J (m27) and I (f29) have been together for 8 years now. When we started dating he was a young lad who had never been in a serious relationship (a green boy one might say), I on the other hand was a bit of a floozy. This led to some serious jealousy through our early years, and now I think a healthy understanding. We both have our own opinions and that's great (personally I think mine are more correct but whatever). He is the kind of person that believes people of the opposite gender shouldn't and can't be friends. Coworkers of opposite gender shouldn't hangout and shouldn't be alone. Ok fair, I see where he is coming from. Personally I think it shouldn't matter and if you truly have trust in your relationship then why would it matter? Right?!?(Definitely curious on your guys thoughts on this) So that being said, that should mean no small talk, limited interactions and definitely no casual texting? Definitely no favours for opposite gendered coworkers, right??? (Any ICU's??) Sooooo! My lovely partner got this job last year and is gone all day, everyday and works with many, many lady's. Oil field workers (if ya know, ya know, if ya don't, these lady's tend to be a bit...loose in morality) J is the kind of guy that everyone likes, he is very charismatic, and very funny. He can get along with anyone and oh my gosh his smile is just the darndest thing. *Fans self* This is a curse and a blessing all at once. J works in the office, in said office he works with a girl, we'll call her Kat. They are very friendly with each other and text and hangout at work. They will get lunch for each other and blah blah blah. I'm not gonna lie, I was definitely jealous at the start and had opinions of my own on their relationship. I was also very, very pregnant and not feeling myself. If you were 60lbs heavier then your usual and bloated like a hot air balloon,I think you'd probably feel the same!! We had some talks on it a few times and I think some boundaries were set. I stopped checking his phone ages ago, at this point I no longer care. After the baby I stopped caring. My theory is I am right here, if he wants to be a loving partner he can, if he doesn't that is his choice and no matter what I say or do he will not change unless he wants to! Period!!(Yaaay growth) I think some extra info is needed here: I will bring him coffees and lunch every now and then, not as much as I'd like as it's a 25 minute drive to his work and I have 2-4 kids with me depending the time of day. Gifts and treats is my love language, he knows this. Yet he doesn't do these things for me. Maybe once in a blue moon, but honestly it happens so infrequently I could count the times he has on one hand.... Anyways!!! Onto the medication part! A few years ago he started taking meds for ADHD and is currently taking Vyvanse. When he started taking medication he changed. A lot. And I don't think it was for the better, he is more short tempered and has little to no patience and he lost a bit of his spark. Idk if it's the medication or just not liking his home life anymore.I'll never fully know. Every now and then he runs out of his prescription and it is not good. He is an ass when he isn't on it, but every time he gets back on it. This month he has been working more then usual due to having to cover someone else's shift so he hasn't been able to go get his prescription refilled. This was days ago and last night we talked and agreed he should just stay off it this time. He has been wanting to get off for ages now, he said now is just a good a time as any other. (Plus it will save a crap ton of money, something he is wanting to do right now) Fantastic news for our family!! And for him! I know it can be hard quiting a substance (yes I know it's medicine but he says he doesn't really need it nor wants to be on it, and in his case it's more of a substance at this point then medication) fast forward too tonight. We are sitting on the couch, snuggling kids getting ready for bedtime. He gets a text and picture from Kat. I ask what is that? (The picture kinda looks like an orange flower thingy from where I am) He said ""Oh just some Vyvanse Kat had, she's gonna bring it to work tomorrow for me."" Pardon my finest duck?! Beotch aren't you trying to quit/are sooooo close to being done your detox from them?!? I was instantly filled with rage.(And possibly a few other emotions) So today she brings you banana bread, tomorrow meds you are trying to quit? Oh ok, cool. Cool, cool, cool. Whatever, you do you, have no regard for what you and your WIFE talked about. Ok not officially wife but we have four fucking kids!! And 8 years together!I'm feeling a tad disrespected, we talked about this (the meds, and Kat for that matter) I already question if my opinions and beliefs matters. If I matter...this just really set those feelings in stone... Am I being a crazy controlling beotch for being so upset by this?!? I also feel hurt that he chooses to still be so close to Kat. I definitely feel they are still super buddy buddy, and I can't help but feel hurt by that... I also just remembered he said she suggested we all hangout together sometime, now I'm feeling sad by their friendship? again *insert eye roll here* (she has a partner btw and awhile ago she would complain about him to J and hide out at work to avoid going home, just some extra context for you guys!!) oh also, also she's quite pretty and totally his type.

Around 2018, he starts expressing interest since we were in the same city. Once again, he would blow me off after hanging out a few times. DONE. DONE DONE DONE. 

2019: he decides he's truly ready for us to be together, that he wants to try. I blew him off for two straight years. I was horrible. I made sure EVERY TIME to rub it in his face the way he was to me. Everytime I would end things with a guy, I would use him as moral support, then be on my way (healthy. I know). He was literally getting on my nerves. 

2021: he was fed up with me, basically professing that he was in love with me and that he wasn't going to tolerate my hurtful behavior anymore. About a month goes by and I realize he isn't getting on my nerves anymore. I called him on a random Thursday and asked if he wanted to do this. We've been together ever since. 

He shortly invited me to come live in his home and never asked for me to chip in on bills. However, I never offered either. Shitty on my end (just wait though). Things were hot and heavy the first year, then I discover he has been hiding untreated major depression and suicidal thoughts. He started locking himself in his mancave, playing video games all night (red flag). I'm not perfect angel in return. I used to have a BAD problem of just shutting down and stonewalling anytime he said something that upset me. I would literally run away. 

Christmas 2022: I watched my brother almost kill my father in a drunken rage. It screwed me up pretty badly. I was NOT ok. I would eat his tortillas and not replace them, I let some dishes pile in the sink in a day, and the icing on the cake was when I lied about flushing two tampons down the toilet. The plumber had to come out and unclog it. I was just so scared of his reaction. I paid for it and everything. Then I paid to have the water service line fixed, then I paid for a new dryer. 

Amongst all this, his mental health is deteriorating. He quit his job, went ape shit on me, saying I was fucking stupid, a poor communicator, a liar, that I never initiated sex (I've had problems with being shy in the past) and that he was done with me. I begged like a dog, on my knees. He kicked me out for two months on our one year. 

May 2023: I come back and start paying $1000/month for utilities only. He has a new job. He nitpicks EVERYTHING I DO. The way I load the dishwasher, my driving skills, doing his laundry when he didn't ask me to, and one time, I was so tired that I walked to the mailbox and forgot to bring up the trash can. He flipped shit and said that I was lazy. I manage to have a panic attack and freak out. He winds up not speaking to me for a week. 

He slept on the couch from May-December 2023 because he didn't want to be in the bed with me. Stopped giving me oral (I was too afraid to ask). He's never affectionate and never is the first to initiate a hug or kiss. 

In 2023, I do the work to make myself better. I get on psych meds, I start hypnosis, and I stop shutting down like a toddler and running away during an argument. 

December 2023: his suicidal thoughts increase. By January 2024, he had quit a third job in three years. We decide it's best that he takes a professional sabbatical, and that I would pay HIS MORTGAGE, all the utilities, the groceries, household items, repairs, everything. He instantly felt better with this arrangement and refused to seek help. For two weeks. He started being cold and mean to me again over EVERY LITTLE THING - the way I put up groceries, the way I would accidentally trip on my feet in the store, etc.  He finally broke down and went to a psych NP who sent him off with an SSRI and Vyvanse. He considered going to her as ""therapy"". It helped, but ever since, he's basically just sat on the couch doing nothing the last year. He doesn't clean the house or do the laundry. He will wash the dishes, but he wrote clean out the sink. He just lets the clean dishes pile up. 

Meanwhile, I'm paying all the bills on a home that I'll never own, getting a master's degree in engineering, and working fulltime as a consultant - aka BUSTING MY ASS. By November, I was starting to break down, having to do all the adulting. One night, he became condescending about a discussion pertaining to why our area's sushi places don't offer delivery. I went on to list some reasons, and he shut me down. From there, I pull up proof that I'm right, and he bluntly tells me that I should never rub stuff in his face like that. So it's ok for him to be condescending towards me, and after he made me cry and didn't speak to me for a week. End of the week, I pack my shit and start loading it. Now HE is the one on his knees begging and pleading for me not to go. I let him have it, calling him MEAN, lying up on the couch, that I've paid $20K on the mortgage this year, and blatantly just not liking me at all. He says that he does love me. A few days go by, and his meek temperament dissipates, freaking out on ME, saying I've forever traumatized him, that he is NOT mean, and that I never offered to chip in on bills when I moved in, so I should be paying the bills. Later that night, he decides he wants sex in the middle of the night. I have a graduation final and a full day of work. He becomes IRATE. 

Even still, after all that, we go on a Christmas trip (that I paid for), thinking it would help us. It did to a point - until he went out in the French Quarter all night ALONE, DRUNK, and LOST. By 4 AM, I called him, threatening to pack up our stuff and go home. He manages to get unlost and makes his way back to the room, flipping out on me, screaming, throwing things and getting in my face for threatening to leave. Falls asleep eventually. Acts like it never happened the next day. 

January 2025: things start taking a turn for the better, surprisingly. Until he started crying about running out of savings and having to ask me for more money. He pretty much told me he would rather die than go back to work. I was just frozen. I didn't know what to say. Regardless, I got him some more money so that he didn't have to ask his parents. Things started really improving then. He started admitting that he's been beating down my spirit for years and that he needs to grow up. I started budgeting weekly date nights so that we aren't always surviving off sandwiches at home. I ask him to prioritize fixing things around the house and getting set up with a new psych provider. Turns out, his previous provider was out of network, and no one told him. He pushed all of this stuff off for a month because he doesn't like to do ""adult things"". 

Late February: he trips in the bathroom. TBI. I rush him to the ER. My world has flipped upside down. I stayed with him the entire time, and he's just awful, angry, and hostile. He can't help it, obviously. I decide to do some nice things like deep clean the house, hang up black out curtains, get a good coffee table for the couch, and general sprucing up the place. I bring him home from the hospital, I went to pick up his meds and paid for them. First thing he freaks out about is that I went to a different pharmacy. His pharmacy was closed on Sundays. He needed pain pills. His car was on 1% oil, so I went and had the oil changed and filled it with gas. 

I scheduled his followup CT and visit with the neurosurgeon. I told the neurosurgeon about his mental health prior to the accident, so they got him set up with an actual neuropsych and psychiatrist. HE WENT BALLISTIC AND ACCUSED ME OF BETRAYING HIM. He then expressed aggravation over the fact that I referred to myself as a domestic partner to all doctors and nurses in the hospital. As a result, they all took me seriously. Had I said that I was his girlfriend, they never would have taken me seriously. His stance was that domestic partners aren't recognized in our state and that I should be cautious about throwing that term around lawyers, but once I explained my stance, he calmed down. TBI or not, these situations were very hurtful to me, considering all of things I had done for him. I suppose I did overstep a boundary when I noticed that his bar (law) license was going to be terminated in April if he didn't complete the rest of his CLEs. I called the bar association and basically told me that if he paid $100, the problem would be fixed. I placed a check in the mail. Furthermore, rather than giving him the usual amount of money for the mortgage/utilities each paycheck in the form of a check, I went to his bank and deposited it into his checking account. Once again, blew a fuse. I understand that he has a TBI, but my resentment is starting to overpower me. 

Final straws this week is when he told me that he is indifferent to marriage and that if I wanted to get married eventually, we could if I wanted to. This kind of shattered my heart. In no way would I marry this man right now, but I always thought that when he got real help and got his life back together (he was an attorney for Godssake) that we would eventually tie the knot. My brain says that he doesn't want to marry me at all. 

Now we're at a point where I'm crazy, I'm bipolar, and I need therapy. I am a poor communicator, I misinterpret just about everything he says and twist it into things that it's not, and that I need to learn how to listen to him and learn how to respond to him in a logical way. He claims his tone isn't mean or cold, he claims he doesn't think I'm stupid, but that's how I FEEL. He claims that I blame him for all my problems, and that it is a very unlikable feature and that other people probably don't like me - as I'm building a consulting business.... 

I'm at a point where I'm starting to convince myself that I am crazy and need help. No one else in my life treats me this way, but then again, he's the person I live with. This TBI has just rocked our world, and I'm trying so hard to not take his words personally. It's getting to a point where the damage is done. Can't leave him right now though due to the TBI, plus he doesn't have a job. Furthermore, he begs me not to leave because he loves me. Yeah, loves that I pay all the bills.

He's 10 days out from his TBI. He's walking, pain is managed, he's sleeping, and he's overall healing. The neurosurgeon told me that he needs someone with him in the house all of the time. I've been wiping his ass and giving him baths since we got home. Last night, he took his own bath and claimed that I should have helped (he didn't ask). He took his own bath tonight just fine. I made arrangements to WFH for the next month, and I've always told him to just ring the bell if he needed anything, that I have to work in a well-lit room. He claims that I have not provided him ANY CARE THIS WEEK - that he's been left on the couch all week to suffer. After I've cleaned his vomit, ordered him all the fast food he wants, EVERYTHING.

So, I was kinda into spirituality (and this is going to sound extremely woo, ill just not remove details) but i felt like last year i admitted (to myself or whatever) that something i thought was true... something about spiritually... and then everything unfolded and suddenly i was just really idk more wrapped up with feeling spiritual things. 

Same thing this year except I decided to just ignore the feeling that I need to accept something. All.. is? was fine? Earlier today though I just felt perfectly socially non-awkward, all was ok, i had a cup of coffee and suddenly I was extremely elated... just typing crazy quick and everything (this just happens on occasion... occasionally without coffee. chalked it up to me having adhd but sometimes i wonder if its deeper). 

Welp. Was in the restroom and i figure i had a migraine? It just was painful. I know it wasnt but i had the ocasional thought that it was cause I decided not to do the spirituality stuff (which makes no sense ik). Occasionally coffee gives me migraines. (and I think I had a double shot of it or something more than i usually do). 

  
Everything feels fine now. but. it feels flat. I dont feel sad or happy or anything. I figured everything was going fine though. (admittedly had some thoughts thatwerent wanted but thats gone). Decided to turn on some music... some sounds that i loved due to how much emotion was in them and that emotion is just... gone? I dont feel like a robot or anything. I just feel like I shut something off in my brain and don't know what the consequences of that are. 

Occasional thoughts that something else was turning the knobs in my mind and i was alot more into that idea before which i realize i shouldntve been. This is a weird feeling. A few weeks ago I just suddenly went into a phase where I had a couple days of music feeling empty and barely anything feeling funny.  Then it stopped. I'm assuming its the same thing but it feels different. More ""whole"" or something? no clue. Went from practically feeling like running off and ruining my life to meh.

She said it makes her intolerable, and that my life would suck. I was able to talk her down and assure her that we can find a way through it, or should at least try. Yesterday she then broke up with me due to wanting space and time to figure out who she is, what she wants, etc. We were happy before this happened, and she even told me that I didn't do anything wrong. We had been together ten months, which doesn't sound like a lot, but we started college together and I've built my life around her. I also think she's my person. To make a long story short I really believe she is my soulmate, and not in a youthful and naive way.

That being said, I'm heartbroken. I didn't text her today, but did run into her while she was heading to an exam and walked her over and had a nice conversation. I asked if she'd be willing to get coffee and sit down and talk next Friday (I think the 22nd) and she said maybe. My new plan is just to text her then so that I am not encroaching on her space as much but still contacting her. Until then, no contact.

If it wasn't obvious, I'm really hoping to get back with her, and was wondering how I should go about it.

His mother texted him (and just him) asking him for lunch on Tuesday or Wednesday this week (not even a week after our convo with her where we agreed we were not satisfied with her apology and would be putting distance). He told me about it but told me he does not want to go. A short while later he told me he texted her back and agreed to meet her for coffee for half an hour. 

When we got home from work, I told him I wanted to talk about it. He said that he suspects she just wants me out of the way but agreed to go anyway ‘with extreme skepticism’ to see what she does. He said if she mistreats him that he will leave and give even more reason to distance ourselves. I said she already mistreated us with her weak ass apology last week and we agreed at that time to keep our distance, yet not even a week later he is meeting her for coffee. 

He started to blame me for not speaking up during the meeting when they said ‘let’s take baby steps’ yet him and I agreed ahead of time that we don’t need to play all our cards and be so blatant about things and just keep our distance without necessarily telling them what we’re doing. He is also saying I should have told him straight up that I was not OK with him meeting his mother for coffee because now currently, I put him in the awkward situation of having said yes. I’m frustrated because I feel like he’s putting it all on me to tell him what to do yet he knows or speculates that she wants to separate the two of us and yet he’s going along with it anyway. That is the bigger problem I feel. Why do I need to tell him what boundaries to keep with his mother and how can he not see it for himself?

Told him how disappointed I was and I went for a drive. But not before I sent his mother a text saying: ‘hi mother-in-law. I understand you are meeting (my husband) for coffee this week. I have been reflecting on our meeting from last week and I wanted to let you know that baby steps are not something I’m prepared to do with you at this time because I feel your apology didn’t give me what I need in terms of owning the specific actions that were problematic… instead you chose to tell us we were in the wrong for how we perceived things. I would like to keep things at requisite family visits for now and will see you at Easter should you choose to host. - (my name)’. 

She texted back and said ‘thank you for your message. I hope we can resolve this one day’. 

I did not respond. Husband can choose not to defend me and pursue whatever relationship he wants with his mother. I’m washing my hands of it as I’ve said my piece and he can continue to disrespect himself if he likes. 

Looks like things aren’t good for us again, but I feel better because I feel like I’m giving myself the respect I deserve by saying her apology wasn’t good enough for me.

Cash App has become one of the most popular peer-to-peer payment platforms, allowing users to send, receive, and invest money with ease.

While the app is primarily designed for legitimate financial transactions, many people are curious about ways to earn or receive free money on Cash App. It’s important to note that there’s no guaranteed way to get free money, and users should always be cautious of scams. However, there are legitimate methods to potentially earn or receive funds on Cash App. Here are some tips and strategies:

* The more people you refer, the more free money you can earn.

Cash App frequently hosts giveaways on their official social media accounts, particularly on Twitter (X).

* Follow Cash App’s official Twitter account (@CashApp).

* Activate your Cash Card if you haven’t already.
* Browse available Boosts in the app and select one before making a purchase.
* Use your Cash Card at the eligible merchant to enjoy the discount or cashback.

# 4. Join Online Surveys and Reward Platforms

* Websites or individuals asking for your Cash App login details.

I asked if she'd be willing to get coffee and sit down and talk next Friday (I think the 22nd) and she said maybe. My new plan is just to text her then so that I am not encroaching on her space as much but still contacting her. Until then, no contact.

If it wasn't obvious, I'm really hoping to get back with her, and was wondering how I should go about it. Everyone in my life says give her space and she'll come back, but at what point do I initiate contact? What else can I do? Should I text her next Friday?",2,1741666874.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I am wondering if there is any recommendation on coffee beans. 
I dont know any local roaster or found a cafe that I really like yet. 
I like chocolatey flavor and do not like floral or acidic taste to the coffee. 
I pretty much only drink ice americano where i would pour double espresso over ice and add some water to it. 
I have seen people using lavazza super crema for the espresso. 
Can you share your go to whole beans?

Thank you so much in advance",1,1741666797.0,superautomatic,4,1.0,False

I really like this table design and want to build my own out of walnut. I'm a little unsure how to do the joinery to make it the strongest. Immediately I'm struck with the idea of mortise and tenon, but its on an angle and I'm not sure how to cut a mortise on an angle like this. I'd probably use 3/4"" or 1"" stock for it.  
Other potentially viable options might include biscuits or dowels. I'm not sure what else. I like the clean edge so I dont want to do dovetail or anything of the sort, it'd ruin the clean aesthetic I want. I'm looking for a coffee table that I dont' have to worry about if an adult were to decide to sit on it, like a guest or something, when I'm not looking.",1,1741666599.0,woodworking,3,1.0,False
