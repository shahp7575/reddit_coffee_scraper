1fy102r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1fy102r/aita_for_not_cutting_off_my_family_for_accusing/,AITA for not cutting off my family for accusing me of being an alcoholic?,"So, for context I (28F) have studied music for most of my life (since I was 7) and my parents put a lot of money into college programs revolving around music. I received a certificate in audio engineering and I teach music in my spare time.

My parents were always incredibly supportive and always did their best to motivate me to enhance my skills. Unfortunately, as I got older I realised that my area of expertise in the industry is becoming obsolete and it would be a lot more difficult to make this lucrative for me without a heavy compromise to my artistry. I still enjoy making and teaching music, but in a much smaller scale now.

Throughout my college years, I suddenly took a RANDOM interest in tea (WTF). I worked at a tea shop and became obsessed with EVERYTHING about it. The best brewing process, all the different types and their benefits, I’ve got a mental encyclopaedia at this point. This interest broadened to coffee in the same way, then the obvious next step: alcohol.

I had my first drink of jäger when I was 17 (because I was so fuckin’ cool) and obviously while I was under age, the first thought was “oh, she’s just a teenager living fast” but, I was actually fascinated by the effects. Not in the sense of wanting to get fucked up, but in the same way that I was fascinated with tea and coffee.

As I got older, I ventured more into the world of alcohol, trying different things, cataloging, comparing, studying different flavour properties, brewing/distilling types, styles, etc and heavily dabbled in bartending. I even started working at a brewery where I am often taste testing throughout my shifts and am building a reputation with local brewmasters. I eventually I decided that I wanted to work toward opening a place of my own.

My parents were concerned at first considering I battled with depression for a while so they were worried that I was possibly an alcoholic and wanted a way to fuel it without any repercussions, but changed their tune as soon as I explained to them that it wouldn’t just be a regular bar, but more of a brewery/distillery with coffee and tea options ALL home grown ingredients and crafted by me. I even gave brought them a few samples of a few lagers I made at home and they absolutely loved them and were super proud. My mom started calling me a “beverage aficionado” and couldn’t wait to brag about it to the rest of the family. 

When I tell you that the word ballistic doesn’t even BEGIN to describe their reaction…
It was like they were told I was running away to join the mob. All I could hear in the back of my head was Mushu shouting “DISHONOUR”.
I was passive aggressively sent random articles about alcoholism and addiction as well as random music/recording equipment and “thoughtful” messages like “Christmas is just around the corner!” or “Someone’s got a birthday coming up soon”.

Social media posts I’ve shared or liked have been responded to with angry reacts and more passive aggressive comments like “did you know that a lot of bars hold live performances? Just something to keep in mind”. Naturally, I got fed up and tweaked my privacy settings to where they could no longer view my posts, comments, etc. 

Fast forward, about a month and a half ago, my grandfather passed away. He was always such a huge inspiration for me to follow my dream and do everything that I want to do in my life no matter what anyone else said or wanted and I loved him very much. My family is HUGE so we had people from all over the country come to the funeral.

The funeral was rough for me. I was a tearful mess, my mom did the eulogy (like a pro) and it was time for the final prayer before the end. I bow my head, the pastor’s speaking and it took a minute for me to register that I was randomly summoned to play and sing the Aretha Franklin version of “I Say a Little Prayer” on the church piano DURING THE PRAYER.

I was like “wait, what?!” in my head before I open my eyes and the ENTIRE church is staring at me besides my parents, grieving grandmother, my fiancé and my mom’s sister little cousins who are all looking at each other like “what???” My mom and aunt wrote the program and when my mom asked if I wanted to speak during the ceremony, I said no because I didn’t think I’d be able to keep it together enough to form a sentence and she was completely understanding and even expected it so there was no way in HELL that she would’ve pulled some shit like this.

My grandparents used to dance to and sing that song together all the time and I grew up to love it because of them. EVERYONE knew this and with my sweet sobbing grandmother who is falling apart from the loss of her husband, I couldn’t bring myself to refuse. I played and sang the song the best I could behind tears and rage. I could smell the steam coming from my parents in the front row. They were so pissed that they couldn’t even truly enjoy my performance which pissed them off more.

After the ceremony, I was congratulated by everyone. Their compliments were soured by the situation I was put in. My grandmother gave me a soul crushing hug and thanked me which just made me even more angry that they used her grief to manipulate me into performing.

It all came to a head however after the burial, when my dad said that he had had enough of them and was going to with my uncle (his brother who also came to the ceremony). This usually meant they were going to go for a drink. My fiancé and I opted to go with, my grandmother was fine with it, and we were preparing to leave when one of the pastors (my grandmother’s brother/my uncle who isn’t super fond of my dad) overheard, pulled me aside to “catch up” as he said.

Looking back now, I was pretty emotional at the time so this is where I may be the a-hole…

My uncle asked me how I was doing, how was work, normal small talk and then came the question of if I had gone back to church. I told him that I work Sunday mornings because that’s when I make the most money. He asked if I made decent money on the other days which I do, but Sunday’s a big brunch day so it’s very lucrative. “No amount of money from some bar is worth more than the love of God and his wishes. He has blessed you with tools of creation (my hands) and you want to waste that on alcohol? Your grandfather didn’t raise you that way”.

“You’re right. He raised me to be a good person, to always do the right thing and to use my tools of creation for whatever makes me happy. Like your mother raised my grandmother and all of you to do the same so I bet she’s really proud of the 400 grandchildren you gave her because you decided to use your tool of creation to spread your love of God to every woman in the state that wasn’t your wife”.

It was that moment I really heard what I had just said so a normal family bye would’ve been hella awkward. I said something along the lines of “wellllll, my dad’s waiting so I’m gonna gooooo” and left him and his stupid pastor pimp shoes in parking lot.

Not even a day later, my phone’s being flooded by family members saying I should apologize to my uncle for what I said and quit my job because it’s turning me into an ugly person and “God doesn’t like ugly” At that point I was done. My grandfather had just died and I was sick of the bullshit. I basically made one mass post and adjusted it for all of my relatives to see saying that if anyone wants to try to manipulate my life and accuse me of being a sinner, alcoholic, etc., they can take it up with God because I’m no longer available and blocked all of them on EVERYTHING.

My grandmother’s disappointed and my mom understands that it was in the heat of the moment, but still thinks I went too far and should apologise and take down the post. My dad of course thinks it was hilarious and warranted and it’s caused a small argument between them.

I got my dad’s silver tongue and we’d both be lying if either of us said that it hasn’t gotten us into trouble and I will even admit that if it would’ve been a different time or situation, I probably would’ve just laughed and walked off instead of taking a verbal knife to my uncle’s sack. However, I still don’t think that warrants any of them getting an apology and I’ve pretty much been ignoring my family.

I just feel bad for all the grief this has given my grandmother when she’s already grieving the loss of the love of her life.

We exchanged names, she thanked me, I wished her good luck on the LSATs, and we parted ways!

So, I work in an office where, for some reason, having a comfortable chair is like finding gold. A few months ago, I decided to invest in a super comfy ergonomic chair for my desk. You know, to save my back and make my workday slightly more bearable.

Then, there’s *Todd* (not his real name, but trust me, he’s a Todd). Todd has this habit of wandering around the office like he’s on a break 80% of the time. One day, I catch him napping in MY chair. I thought it was a one-time thing, maybe he just needed a quick power nap, so I let it slide. But then it became a daily occurrence. Every time I step away for a minute—bathroom, grabbing coffee, whatever—I come back, and there’s Todd, dead asleep in my chair, drooling on MY armrest like he pays rent here.

So, I confront Todd, and he’s like, “Oh, sorry, dude. Your chair’s just really comfortable. I can’t help it. It’s like a sleep magnet!” I tell him it’s weird, and he needs to stop using my workspace as his personal nap station. He laughs it off and says, “Come on, it’s just a quick nap. You’re not using it.”

I thought that would be the end of it, but NO. Todd keeps sneaking in, and now I’m paranoid about leaving my desk, afraid I’ll find him there mid-snooze. I finally snapped and told him straight up, “Stay out of my chair or I’m reporting this to HR.” Now he’s acting all hurt, saying I’m overreacting and should just “chill out.” I guess he’s giving me the cold shoulder now—probably because he can’t nap in *my* chair anymore.

So, AITA for laying down the law and evicting Todd from my chair naps?",12,1728279920.0,AITAH,15,1.0,False
1fy0m8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1fy0m8b/oxo_brew_8_cup_coffee_maker_yay_or_nay/,Oxo Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker Yay or Nay?,"After using the **Oxo Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker** for a few months, I’ve come to appreciate how this machine effortlessly balances convenience with the quality of the brew. Here’s my personal experience with some of its standout features and performance.

#### Dual Filter Baskets: Flexibility for Different Batch Sizes

One of the first things that caught my attention was the dual filter basket system. It comes with a larger flat-bottom basket for brewing 5-8 cups and a smaller cone-shaped insert for 2-4 cups. This setup has been a game changer in my household. On weekends, I love making a full pot of coffee for everyone, and during the week, I just need a quick cup for myself. The fact that the Oxo can brew both large and small batches without sacrificing flavor is fantastic. It adjusts seamlessly between the two, making it perfect for households with varying coffee needs.

#### Bloom Cycle: Enhancing Flavor

The built-in **bloom cycle** has noticeably improved the flavor of my coffee. The machine pre-saturates the grounds before brewing, ensuring an even extraction and fuller flavor. I’ve used coffee makers without this feature before, and the difference in taste is remarkable—especially for the first cup of the day. The bloom cycle really brings out the subtle notes in my coffee, which is something I’ve grown to love.

#### Easy-to-Clean Sprayhead

Maintenance is always a consideration for me, and the Oxo’s **easy-to-clean sprayhead** has been a welcome addition. It evenly distributes water over the coffee grounds, and it’s designed to be disassembled easily for cleaning. I’ve had issues with scale buildup in the past with other machines, but I’ve found that the Oxo’s sprayhead prevents those problems. Taking it apart and giving it a quick clean is simple, which has helped keep the machine running smoothly.

#### Versatile Drip Tray: For Travel Mugs and More

The **drip tray** is another thoughtful design element that I didn’t realize I needed until I started using it. It catches any spills when brewing into smaller cups, but it can also be flipped to raise the cup closer to the brew basket, which is especially handy when I’m brewing directly into a travel mug. This reduces splashes and makes it easier to brew on-the-go.

#### Thermal Carafe: Keeps Coffee Hot

The **thermal carafe** keeps my coffee hot for hours without the need for a warming plate, which I’ve found crucial on slower weekend mornings. The coffee stays warm without burning, and I love that I don’t have to rush through a full pot. I’ve had other machines with glass carafes where the coffee would go cold quickly, so this has been a huge improvement for me.

#### Consistently Good Flavor

What I’ve really come to appreciate is the **consistent quality** of the brew. Every cup tastes rich and full-bodied, whether I’m brewing a small 2-cup batch or a full 8-cup carafe. I’ve tried other brands like Moccamaster, and while they’re great, I’ve found the Oxo’s performance to be right up there, especially for the price.

#### Tips for Optimal Performance

I did notice that **grind size and coffee-to-water ratios** play a significant role in getting the perfect cup. For smaller brews, I had to experiment a bit with grind settings to dial in the right flavor, but once I found the sweet spot, the results were consistently great. I’d recommend taking the time to tweak these settings for the best flavor.

#### Notable Downsides

One thing that I’ve encountered is the **cleaning cycle**. Sometimes the machine prompts a cleaning cycle before it feels necessary, and resetting the cleaning light has required me to run the descaling process more than once. It’s a bit of a hassle, but not a dealbreaker. Another small issue I’ve noticed is with the **filter baskets**—the smaller basket requires taller filters to prevent overflow, which can sometimes be tricky to find.

#### No Temperature Control

While the Oxo Brew 8-Cup delivers excellent coffee, one limitation is the lack of **water temperature control**. Machines like the Breville Precision offer this feature, which is useful if you’re brewing different types of beans that need specific water temperatures. That said, for the price point, I don’t mind this limitation, and I’ve been happy with the temperature it brews at for standard medium roasts.

#### Final Thoughts

Overall, the Oxo Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker has been a fantastic addition to my kitchen. The ability to brew both small and large batches with ease, the thoughtful design features like the bloom cycle and versatile drip tray, and the rich, consistent coffee it produces make it well worth the investment. While there are a couple of small quirks, the positives far outweigh them, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality coffee maker.",1,1728279864.0,Coffee_Machines,0,1.0,False
1fy0l0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OwnBadger7368/comments/1fy0l0p/information_about_the_disposals/,Information about the disposals,"Disposable items, such as paper plates, plastic utensils, and cups, are commonly used for convenience, especially in picnics, parties, takeout services, and large gatherings where cleaning reusable items is impractical. They are designed for single-use, reducing the need for washing and saving time. Disposable items are also popular in food industries and healthcare settings for hygiene purposes, as they help prevent cross-contamination. However, while convenient, their environmental impact has raised concerns, leading to growing efforts to replace them with eco-friendly, recyclable, or compostable alternatives.

[Various sizes of white disposable paper plates, ideal for picnics, parties, and casual dining, offering convenience and reducing the need for dishwashing.](https://preview.redd.it/j6b93xzru9td1.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3fa2f12fa78f5c14ba2b8ccf9163bf4438c9810)

# 1. Types of Disposables:

* **Paper Plates**: Often used in picnics, parties, and fast food services.
* **Plastic Utensils**: Forks, knives, spoons, cups, and straws.
* **Disposable Cups**: Paper or plastic cups used in various settings, including coffee shops.
* **Takeout Containers**: Common in food delivery services; made from plastic, Styrofoam, or biodegradable materials.
* **Paper Napkins and Towels**: Single-use for cleaning and hygiene.
* **Plastic Bags**: Used for carrying groceries or products.

# 2. Materials Used:

* **Paper-Based Disposables**: Such as paper plates, cups, and napkins. These are often biodegradable but might have coatings (like wax or plastic linings) that can slow degradation.
* **Plastic-Based Disposables**: These include cutlery, cups, and straws made from petroleum-based plastics like polystyrene or polypropylene. These can take hundreds of years to decompose.
* **Biodegradable/Compostable Alternatives**: Made from materials like bamboo, corn starch, or bagasse (sugarcane byproducts), these are designed to break down more easily in composting facilities.

# 3. Environmental Impact:

* **Waste Generation**: Disposables contribute significantly to solid waste. In particular, plastic-based disposables often end up in landfills, oceans, and other environments where they persist for centuries.
* **Energy Use**: The production of disposable items, especially plastics, consumes large amounts of energy and natural resources.
* **Pollution**: Plastic disposables are a major source of environmental pollution, especially in oceans where they harm marine life.

# 4. Alternatives to Single-Use Disposables:

* **Reusable Items**: Encouraging the use of reusable plates, cups, and utensils to minimize waste.
* **Recyclable Disposables**: Some disposable items are made from recyclable materials, which can help reduce the environmental burden if properly sorted and processed.
* **Compostable Disposables**: Designed to break down in composting facilities, these are becoming more popular, especially in eco-conscious businesses.

# 5. Regulations and Bans:

* Many governments and cities around the world are introducing bans or taxes on certain disposable items, particularly plastic straws, bags, and Styrofoam containers, to encourage more sustainable practices.
* For example, the **European Union's directive on single-use plastics** has banned certain plastic disposables like cutlery and plates.

# 6. The Future of Disposables:

* There's growing interest in developing more sustainable disposable products, such as those made from **bioplastics** or **compostable materials**.
* **Circular economy** approaches are being explored, where products are designed to be reused, recycled, or composted to reduce environmental impact.",1,1728279721.0,u_OwnBadger7368,0,1.0,False

To start, **who am I?** I'm a gay man in his 30s who lives in DC and has many straight female friends in the city (including one who I helped apply for this season, though she didn't make it on) and straight guy friends as well (I was in a fraternity in college in DC and many of my frat brothers stayed in the city after).

So, that being said, what makes dating in DC unique?

1. **Transient City** - DC is a VERY transient city full of transplants across the city who will often just be here for a few years. Given rapid changes across the city, and often gentrification, there can be tension between native Washingtonians and transplants and there can be a divide here in the dating scene as well. DC also has been known as ""Chocolate City"" and used to be 70% Black and known as a center for Black intellectuals. Through rapid change, a lot of transplants, and some people moving to the suburbs, DC is now about 40% Black. The transient nature of DC can also make DC a tough place to date because people are constantly coming and leaving and you may start dating someone who is looking for jobs elsewhere at the time or has dreams of settling elsewhere while you're looking to stay.
2. **Job Types/""Influence"" -** Not everyone in DC has a government job or works on the Hill (I and most of my friends don't), but a significant proportion of the DC area population does have a government job and obviously there are a lot of Hill staffers. DC is made up of often overly ambitious go-getters who have hopes and dreams of making the world a better place. Not many people on this season have what would be considered very DC jobs. These would include government employees/contractors, Hill staffers, people who own their own nonprofits/NGOs, people in media/journalism, community activists, endless ""consultants"" who don't even understand what they do themselves (ex: Deloitte, KPMG), lawyers (ex: immigration attorneys), lobbyists, people in med school, military contractors or army engineers, etc. In DC, a common first question is ""What do you do?"" But DC ""elitism"" is very different from a city like NYC where status is about money or Boston where it's about what top tier school you went to. In DC, it's about ""power"" and ""influence"". You can be considered a major player in the DC scene making a low salary at a powerful nonprofit, for instance. Jobs matter a lot in DC - less so in terms of things like money per se - but because people are often incredibly passionate about the work they do and it's a sign of ambition, passion, and your interests. But people can also sometimes prioritize their ambitions ahead of dating. This is a big part of the dating scene.
3. **Politics/Conversations** - The types of conversations people have in DC are different than anywhere else I've been. The conversation where Monica asked Steven whether he's voted/who he's voted for is incredibly common date talk in DC. People don't date people who don't share their political beliefs here. But even greater of a cardinal sin here is to be someone who does not vote and/or isn't politically engaged. This conversation literally ends dates and relationships here. And politics are discussed everywhere - on dates, overheard in grocery stores, at restaurant tables, etc. and/or people are constantly talking about what's going on in the world in ways that are often topics to avoid in other cities. If this season was ""more DC"", political convos and/or convos about world affairs would've been incredibly common in the pods. In DC, it's truly considered a way that you align on ""values"" in a way that religion might do so in other cities. Deep, intellectual conversations are quite common, even on first dates.
4. **Sexual Orientation** - DC is an incredibly gay city on par with San Francisco as the most gay city in the US (not saying this in a derogatory way at all - I'm a gay man). The joke is often ""you're gay until proven straight"" in DC. And when casting was taking so long in DC, outside of another factor being that many people have security clearances they were worried about w/ being on the show, a lot of people were wondering how they'd find enough straight men to cast in DC lol. DC is a very tough city for straight single women to date because of this. But can actually be a very good city for straight men to date because of far less competition. It's pretty common here to see straight men here dating women far out of their league. There are also a number of women dating openly bi men, which I've found to be very rare in most cities. Because of how gay DC is, women will often take interest in a guy just for her gay friends to act in shock that she doesn't realize the guy is gay lol.
5. **Men in DC + Types of Guys Women Like** - Also because of how gay DC is, it is very common for straight women here to have many gay friends. Unlike in a lot of other places where a ""manly"" man is seen as most attractive, due to women here often being very progressive politically, quite independent (financially, in careers, as people), and surrounding themselves with close gay friends, women here often actually go for the opposite of a quote on quote ""manly"" man and try to filter out guys that could be deemed ""toxically masculine"". Other women may actually go for the opposite. Because DC is so gay, there are women who fear if they date anyone other than a super ""manly"" man, they might find themselves dating a gay man. The number of women here who have an ex who came out as gay is WILD. But that also gets us to the different types of men in DC and in the suburbs. A lot of straight men in DC will also have gay friends themselves (which can be less common in other cities) and be incredibly comfortable with their sexuality and be less of ""manly"" men. But many still have a superiority complex, often because DC is a great place for them to date that allows them to often date above their weight (dating women who are more attractive/more successful than them). Neighborhoods like the Wharf and Navy Yard have a lot of DC's few Republicans, often who work for Republicans on the Hill. These straight men tend to be very preppy/fratty and are often shunned in the dating scene by women here. Outside DC, in places like Arlington VA, Alexandria VA, and Bethesda MD, while the men still tend to be politically progressive, they tend to be more traditional and often more of the bro-ey, ""masculine"" types. Some DC women are into that, others are very against that. AND there's a saying in DC that we're unwilling to even cross the river from DC to date someone in Northern Virginia, even if it's like 10 mins away lol.
6. **Diversity** - DC is an incredibly diverse city, and though most of this cast does not live in DC, the diversity of this cast is one of the best reflections of the city this season even though that's not to the fullest extent. As mentioned earlier, DC is around 40% Black (used to be much higher) and is a major haven of Black culture. DC and its suburbs like Silver Spring MD also have a massive Ethiopian population, which makes the area one of the best for Ethiopian food in the country. We also have a sizable and growing Latino population. And while Latinos in other major cities in the US are often mostly made up of people of Mexican, Puertorican, Dominican, Cuban, and Venezuelan descent, DC's largest Latino population are Salvadorians. I'm not sure if any of the main cast this season were immigrants, but it definitely would've felt very DC for there to be cast members who were. 
7. **Dates** - I may have missed this being asked, but it was interesting to not hear anyone ask in the pods what kind of dates people enjoy. Of course there are still the drinks/dinner/coffee dates in DC, but I'd say date locations in DC tend to be a bit more unique on average than in a lot of other places. It's quite common for first dates to be at a museum (ex: National Portrait Gallery), a walk (ex: walking the monuments at night or checking out the embassies), checking out a festival (ex: the H Street Festival), etc. 

I know this was SUPER long (apologies!), but I hope it provides an interesting look into some of the nuances of DC dating and what can make dating here unique as well as challenging AND interesting. It would've been cool to see some of these nuances reflected in the season's casting and the conversations they had in and out of the pods. 

From watching the show, the few cast members that feel very DC to me are Taylor (actually lives here, has a very DC job, and is very intellectual in conversation), Bohdan (with the Ukraine/go-getter stuff, not the SA allegations), Ramses (his line of work and him not really trying to be some like buff ""manly"" guy), and Monica (ambitious, asked about politics in the pods, talked about how she used to very much consider a guy's job in who she dated). Most of the others don't make me think of DC at all. Brittany is VERY not DC - even in a ""power-broker"" city like DC, there aren't really many trophy wife types at all. Women tend to be highly independent here, including financially, and like to work. And many like to split a check rather than being more traditional around a man paying. Nick is also very not DC, BUT is pretty reflective of men in the suburbs outside DC (ex: Arlington VA guys). Hannah also comes across as very not DC. Leo comes across as very Bethesda MD, but not DC. Steven doesn't come across as DC either.

Anyway, feel free to ask any questions based on this and I (or other Washingtonians) will be happy to answer, though I can't promise to know everything!",4,1728279485.0,LoveIsBlindNetflix,0,1.0,False

**1. Smart Meeting Rooms**

Shared office spaces are increasingly equipped with smart meeting rooms that foster collaboration between in-house teams and remote workers. These rooms are outfitted with tools such as video conferencing systems, interactive displays, and real-time collaboration software. Such features allow for seamless interactions across the globe, making meetings more productive and inclusive.

**2. Cloud-Based Collaboration Tools**

Cloud technology has been a game-changer in shared work environments. Tools like Google Workspace, Slack, and Microsoft Teams are now essential, allowing users to access files, communicate, and collaborate on projects from anywhere. This flexibility has enhanced the appeal of coworking spaces, particularly for freelancers, startups, and remote workers who value the ability to work from multiple locations.

**3. Internet of Things (IoT) for Workspace Efficiency**

The IoT is redefining how shared office spaces operate. Smart lighting, temperature controls, and even coffee machines can now be connected to a central hub, ensuring an optimized work environment. Not only do these innovations promote energy efficiency, but they also contribute to employee satisfaction and productivity. With the help of mobile apps, users can adjust their workspace settings with just a tap, creating personalized environments suited to their preferences.

**4. Hot Desking and Scheduling Tools**

Tech-integrated workspaces make it easy to reserve desks, meeting rooms, or breakout spaces using mobile apps or online platforms. Hot desking systems, supported by advanced booking software, are a popular feature in shared spaces, enabling flexible seating arrangements that maximize space utilization. This technology-driven approach makes it easier for members to access and manage resources without hassle.

**5. Cybersecurity Measures**

With the increasing reliance on digital tools and cloud platforms, ensuring data security has become paramount in shared office spaces. Many coworking spaces now provide secure, enterprise-grade networks that protect users' sensitive data. Biometric access controls, encrypted networks, and firewalls are just a few of the security measures that tech-integrated workspaces are implementing to safeguard against cyber threats.

**6. AI and Automation**

Artificial intelligence is making its way into coworking environments through AI-driven chatbots for customer support, smart scheduling assistants, and even occupancy sensors that can predict space usage patterns. Automation is not only improving efficiency but also offering personalized services to users, helping coworking spaces stand out in a competitive market.

**7. VR/AR for Collaboration**

Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies are slowly making their mark in shared workspaces. For industries that require visualization and interactive experiences, these tools provide new ways to collaborate and present ideas. From 3D modeling to immersive training environments, VR/AR are becoming key assets in tech-integrated coworking spaces, especially for design and engineering teams.

# Conclusion

Tech-integrated workspaces are not just a trend; they are shaping the future of how we work. By harnessing technology, shared office spaces are evolving into smarter, more efficient environments that foster creativity, collaboration, and productivity. For businesses and individuals alike, these innovations offer the flexibility and resources needed to thrive in today’s digital age.Shared office spaces have transformed how modern professionals approach work, offering flexible, collaborative environments that adapt to a diverse range of needs. As businesses continue to embrace hybrid and remote working models, these spaces provide a perfect blend of community, convenience, and technology.

1fy0gor,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1fy0gor/being_an_ugly_women_in_india_is_hell/,Being an ugly women in India is hell.,"I am one of those girls who are considered ugly in India. I have a dark skin and slightly fat/overweight. 

My life has been no less than hell.

I remember in my teen years, how I was constantly reminded of my skin colour by my aunts, cousins, grandma and even my mother. I hated attending family events, there wasn't a single event where the relatives would just let me be and not comment on my appearance. I hated taking pictures, for obvious reasons.

The worst treatment I received was from my own mother. I was not allowed to be at peace even at my home. She would always make heart wrenching comments on me and push me to apply turmeric, milk and all sorts of spices and food on my face to make me fair. And when they won't work, I was the one who had to face her frustration. I was a punching bag for her. The worst part was constant comparison to my younger sister. She is one extremely gorgeous girl, with a great skin and I love her. My mom and relatives never left a chance to compare me to my sister. They asked her about her skin care and told me to take some tips from my sister.

The worst part was my school/college life. I was a part of art and literature club. Our club was once organising a play during Independence Day, I was selected for an important role by my sports teacher. Everything was going well and I was well rehearsed for my role. Just 4 days before our play, I was replaced by another girl and I was put into background narration part. I asked about it to the sports teacher and he told me that the English teacher wanted 'someone presentable' for the role, and she was the one who replaced me. This particular incident broke me completely. I withdrew my name from all activities and clubs and cried in my room for several days. Never took part in anything else from then onwards.

The dating part is non existent in my life. While other girls in school/college were surrounded by boys, I was left alone and ignored. Never went out on dates, coffees or movies nothing...!

 I was invisible to most of them. No men ever approached me, texted me or even talked to me unless they needed my help in their work. While my other friends had their DMs always filled with some or the other boy sending them memes or just trying to talk. (I know I sound jealous, because I am. /s). Even the boys who were leftover and rejected by others never really approached/talked to me, probably because they were okay with being alone, rather than being with someone ugly. I never really felt desirable.

I remember once I overheard a group of boys in my school teasing/bullying another boy about how he will get a girl like me, because he doesn't have ""aukaat"" of expecting anything more. And the boy who was being bullied replied, ""I would rather die single"" and whole group laughed about it. 

My mother is trying to set up an AM for me. But we all know what they are like. I don't really wanna get married.

I am 25 rn, I have bagged a govt job that pays me enough to live my life independently. I have stopped visiting my mother or relatives who broke me as a kid. And have also accepted my fate, I am all set to live my life alone and idc about things anymore. The things will fall into place if they want to. I am at peace right now.

The thing is, they were together for 8 years and engaged til they split up only a 2 years ago. They’ve been in contact since, they never stopped keeping in touch, only lessened the frequency. Never went no contact. They share custody of a pets and have many mutual friends She lives 2 hours away.

Last year he said he wasn't over her yet, so we began dating in the summer when he said he finally was and the tension was building between us.

They go into town to bring each other the pets for shared custody. Last time she was in town, she arrived at 2am, because 1 of their dogs had been cleared for surgery … and she was bringing the dog to my ex and she had a bunch of gear in her car. She was staying at her friend’s place about 25 minute drive from my boyfriend’s place. Her friend has a huge dog, so she couldn’t spend the night there with their tiny, sick dog. 

She told my boyfriend  that she’d need his help at 2am to bring the dog in since the dog gets hyper. And she’ll be super tired once she stops for the hand off and just wants to crash at his place. He said yes. She offered to sleep on the couch and he rejected it. I was trying to brainstorm ways to make the handoff/situation easier for everyone (ie. lockbox, etc), and when I did, he said “Ok I’ll call her to ask”… and then he’d message or call me back to say it won’t work for her, and that she needs his help when she arrives. I let him know I felt really uncomfortable with it, and he understood. 

So she spent the first night, as of 2am that night, at my boyfriend’s place with the small dog so the dog wouldn’t be too confused… and because she was too tired to drive the extra 25 mins to her friend’s place. So she slept in my boyfriend’s bed, while he crashed on the couch of his friend who lives nearby. He texted and called me when he walked home. He went over in the morning, the ex left for her friend’s place 25 mins away. 

My boyfriend was so exhausted the next day, he canceled plans to have coffee with her and they rain checked for the next time she’s in town. According to him, she knows about me. 

Thoughts? What should I do, break up with him or talk to him or her about this, and if so - how? 

TL;DR: my (F/37) new bf (m/33) has shared custody of pets with his his ex-fiancée (f/35) and he let her stay over at his place after she drove 2 hrs to be in town to bring 1 of their dogs to him, and insisted he stay up til 2am on a work night to help her. He crashed on his friend’s couch nearby while his ex slept in his bed with their dog. he can’t set boundaries with her, and they even still say “i love you” to each other but he says it’s platonic.

1fy0ctm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1fy0ctm/second_time_mom_gestational_diabetes_advice/,"Second time mom, gestational diabetes advice.","Hey everyone, 

A little backstory, I go to a midwifery office that is associated with my local hospital, so each appointment I generally see a different midwife. I like this cause then everybody is abreast of your pregnancy so when you go in labor, the midwife on call at the hospital knows your situation, you and your baby. My first baby was born vaginally at 40+4, 9lbs 10oz, 22 inches long. I pushed for 4.5hrs before he was born and I only pushed that long because, even though my water broke naturally, my bag of waters slipped down and blocked his way out so it had to be manually broken and he came two pushes after that. My 1hr blood glucose result with his pregnancy was 119mg/dL.

I am currently 31 weeks pregnant with my second. At my glucose test appointment at 28 weeks, I had the one hour test with a 125mg/dL result. The midwife that oversaw it that day cleared me of gestational diabetes. At the end of the appointment we prescheduled my appointment that just passed, October 4th, and an ultrasound for when I’m 36 weeks since the ultrasound techs get booked up quick, I thought no big deal, they did that with my first and it was to make sure he wasn’t breech. 

This past appointment on Friday, October 4th, it was decided by the midwife I saw for this appointment that I needed to start tracking my blood glucose levels two hours after every meal. The midwife also scheduled me for a growth scan for my next appointment in two weeks and said we would go over my blood sugar tracker that she gave me because she’s concerned that my result was too high, despite the reference range being 0mg/dL - 139mg/dL. My anatomy ultrasound at 21+4, the baby was measuring two weeks and one day ahead. The midwife that day said “your first was big, and you didn’t have gestational diabetes, so it’s normal that your second would be on the bigger side as well.” and issued no concerns about it. Every midwife I’ve seen so far this pregnancy has issued no concerns whatsoever about this baby measuring a little big until this most recent appointment. 

Now, this is where I need the advice. I have just finished my second day of testing. 
October 5th; fasting glucose when I woke up was 84mg/dl. My breakfast glucose was 123mg/dL, taken three hours after eating cause I was at work cutting hair so I was an hour late getting the read. Lunch glucose was 106mg/dL, taken 2hrs and 12 minutes after eating. Dinner glucose was 113mg/dL, taken 2 hours and ten minutes after eating.
October 6th; my fasting glucose was 94mg/dL.
My breakfast glucose was 132mg/dL one hour after eating, 108mg/dL 2 hours after eating. I didn’t eat lunch today because it was a busy day at work, I didn’t even get a chance to take a break. My dinner glucose is the only one that has been above 140mg/dL cause I had McDonald’s for dinner….I rarely do this and I probably shouldn’t have today, but I had been on my feet for 6 hours straight and decided grabbing something quick on the way home was less mentally taxing than making dinner at home. My 2 hour read for dinner was 150mg/dL, so I decided to take another read an hour later and got a blood sugar read of 92mg/dL. 
I get that this midwife is concerned I will develop late onset gestational diabetes but part of me feels like this is pointless if no one else was concerned about it, never mentioned late onset gestational diabetes and all told me that I “must just make large babies and that’s perfectly okay,” why is she the only one to be concerned with a 125mg/dL result? And if she was really concerned about it, why didn’t she just schedule me to come back for a three hour glucose test instead? So far, the only conclusion I’ve been able to come to is that it was because she had a student shadowing her for this appointment and was trying to turn my visit into a teachable moment for her student. The other tricky thing is, I typically only eat breakfast and dinner with one to two small snacks in between, a cup of coffee and a bottle of water with breakfast, and water regularly throughout the day. If I eat breakfast and lunch, I have to force dinner down and will feel rundown and nauseous like I’ve overindulged and inevitably get heartburn because of it. By being told that I need to change my diet to three square meals a day for the next two weeks, it feels like I’m being told to lie about it all for what feels like a teaching moment? And whose to say this doesn’t cause my weight to jump up tremendously ruining my good track record of healthy, non-concerning weight gain in pregnancy?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, because if my reads stay consistently below 140 by Wednesday morning, I’m calling their office and telling them that I’m not wasting anymore mental and physical energy on this. Honestly I feel like if it’s that concerning then they should just schedule me for another in office glucose test. ",1,1728278760.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

I (45 f)got up to go to work in the morning and was running late so I skipped my morning coffee and just went.  Came home late afternoon and went to load my dishwasher.  There is a black sock, soaking wet, lying next to my sink.  At the time my nephew, 23, was living with me so I figured it was his.  Strange of him to leave a wet sock by the sink as he’s a very tidy person and that wasn’t like him at all.  Later on I was watching tv and he came home and went into the kitchen to make food.  He asks me “ Is this your sock.” ? I told him no, I thought it was his.  He then tells me he found it that morning in the sink and it’s definitely not his because he only wears Nike brand low socks. This sock was a man’s Hanes mid shin style sock.

My nephew is not the joking type and isn’t a humorous type person and I know that all his socks are Nike brand ( he showed me lol) I am single and don’t wear men’s socks.  No one has access to my home, key wise.  Anyway, it was a weird experience and no one I told the story to had any logical explanation.",5,1728278543.0,Unexplained,2,1.0,False

So basically we are hired by a 3rd party contractor that works for the school district and there is 1 main guy from the district that works at the school and every morning goes over our work from the previous night. There is a logbook where he writes down every complaint that he has. 

Ok I'm in charged of cleaning all the hallways and stair ways which he walks daily and the rest of my coworkers clean the classrooms which they claim he inspects every single classroom in the building as well as over 25 bathrooms but I believe they are lying I truly feel he only walks down the hallways I highly doubt he has time in the morning to check every single room I think he leaves it up to the teachers to complain is anything is wrong but anyway this means I'm the one with most of the complaints unless someone forgets to refill paper towels in the bathroom then one of the morning custodians gets notified and they notify the head guy about it. 

I've gotten complaints such as ""corners of hallways dusty"" ""stairwells dusty"" last week one of the garbage bags leaked ice coffee and it completely slipped my mind to go back and mop that area next day ""whole 1st floor is not being spot mopped"" bottom line it's a huge school we get paid crap every single custodian working there works 2 jobs because we can't afford to live off $14hr 40 hour work week my rent alone is $1200 and my check comes out to $1748 a month after taxes. I'm not complaining about the pay I personally choose to work there but I didn't realize for how cheep they pay it would be so strict. 

Ok here's how I see it I may not do 100% good job but I show up on time every single day and I work. Let's say I do about a 92% with the rest being small things that I miss or don't have time to get too. Well the point of all of this is that the main guy working for the district has not told me anything personally but my coworker that is in charge as a lead (not supervisor) basically told me that if I kept getting complaints he was going to request I be transferred to a different school. Again from my point of view all these ""complaints"" have been every minor things the essential parts of the cleaning still get done every day without issue such as sweeping all hallways, removing gum from the floors, mopping all floors and taking out all the garbage across the whole school. I never thought at such a low wage they would be so picky as a comparison the neighbor district pays their custodians $18.50hr and are hired directly although we only clean and they are expected to be handy mans essentially.

I, 45/butch-presenting, have historically dated femmes. Well, more accurately, women who were more femme than myself. I was very attracted to them in my younger years (and I still am) but something has shifted. 

Years ago, I matched with “Alex” on a dating app. We exchanged phone numbers in short time, communicated via text for a few days, then met for coffee that weekend. Coffee turned into a walk around the local farmer’s market and then breakfast at one of my favorite places. We had a great time! She was lively, engaging, excellent conversationalist, stunning blue eyes, and overall a woman I found very attractive. But. Alex was butch. And she was interested in me. After we parted ways, she said she wanted to see me again. I panicked and made some dumbass excuse why I could not. I was not mean about it, just not entirely honest. But Alex did not deserve that, I sorely regret doing it to this day. I could NOT wrap my fool head around dating another butch. In 20+ years of romantic relationships with women, none of them were more butch than me. I had no idea how to do this. 
Now I find myself single again after a messy breakup (it was definitely complicated) and a prolonged state of heartache (we split a year ago, they have been dating other people for some time). I am coming out of my fog and am considering entering the dating pool again, whatever that looks like. IDFK. 
I think about Alex sometimes. Not to try to reconnect with her per se, I hope she is well and happy. But I think about dating someone like her. Like me. 

The question is: do any of you have any advice on how to go about reprogramming an archaic notion that “a lesbian relationship must be butch/femme” that was so deeply seated into my identity?

Yesterday I hosted an event with strangers and was public speaking, addressing the entire group - something I would never usually be able to do. I felt my mind growing far more open-minded, and I was able to juggle multitudes more. I caught up with a friend from another country who I haven’t seen for 6 months, and they said my skin was the best they’ve ever seen it. 

And today has been a mess. I woke up on the wrong side of the bed and felt like shit. Strangely, the first thing I thought to do was read my notes on the last time I relapsed and how shit it made me feel. But something in my brain stopped me - it’s like, I knew if I read those notes I would end up not having a coffee, so I decided to not read them and get a coffee. It’s total addict behaviour. I’m not even kidding, I felt amazing for 10 minutes. Before I finished my cup, a feeling of impending doom came crashing in. My hands and arms and legs have been shaking all day, up until now (6 hours after my coffee). I’ve had maybe 5 cramps in my whole life, and today I went on a short easy walk and my legs started cramping on the way back. 

Currently, I just feel so disappointed in myself and shaky, and I have this feeling of impending doom. I think I have depression and social anxiety caffeine aside, and caffeine just brings to my attention how deliberating both of those things are. It brings forth all my insecurities and magnifies them. I know I’m going to sleep horribly today and I have a huge day tomorrow, with a 5am start and I’m absolutely dreading it. I want to cry. I want to escape my life for the next few days. 

I’m not sure where I’m going with this, perhaps some of you can relate. It’s ironic, by trying to control when I am happy, I deprive myself of actually getting to feel any happiness at all. 

I thought that I wanted energy, but today I’ve been extremely energetic and it’s been awful. I realise now, it’s not energy I crave at all, it’s happiness and a feeling of content, two things that caffeine is stealing for me.

She joined our team during the pandemic. As pathetic as it sounds, I fell for her the minute she introduced herself on Zoom. She's insanely beautiful, but in a classic, refined and almost ethereal way, not like the women on TikTok and Instagram.

When things started to normalize and Heather and I met face to face for the first time, it felt like there was was instant chemistry. At first, a small group of us would get together for drinks or dinner outside of work. Eventually, I gathered the courage to ask Heather to grab a coffee alone and we started to hang out just us two. 

I fell for her hard the more I got to know her. I found her more down to earth than any of the other beautiful women I'd come into contact with. She's the type who'd rather spend a weekend staying in and reading a book cover to cover than going out and getting wasted. I'm not lacking in dating experience, but admittedly I've only managed to date women I felt were beneath me in some way. Heather is the first woman who's surpassed my physical standards AND lacks the conceitedness that would prevent her from giving a guy like me a chance. 

For over a year, we've been meeting one on one outside of work. To me, the meetups felt like dates, so I gathered up the courage to ask her how she felt about me. She said she enjoyed spending time with me, but wasn't ready to date. I accepted that and we continued to hang out as normal. The advice I read on the internet recommended I distance myself and meet other women, but something in my heart told me Heather was ""the one"" and that I just needed to give her some time. 

The problem is, I found that Heather seemed to have some unresolved emotional baggage with this guy named ""Ricky"" (31M). She claimed he was ""just a friend"" yet would, on occasion, incessantly talk / ask me for ""advice"" about him. This would usually come after alcohol, and could last for up to hours. Despite apparently having no romantic feelings for him, she would be annoyed with him for dating multiple women and being an all around assh\*le.

She met him at her previous place of employment. He wasn't an actual coworker but was part of the security team hired by her firm. From what I'd heard, he seemed to be the thuggish type who could barely hold down a job. He dropped out of college to pursue a pro MMA career, flamed out due to an ""injury,"" worked in security, construction, an electronics shop, a fitness coach, sold used cars, and now co-owns a few ""girls bars"" with his other MMA flameout buddies. Oh, and he's estranged from his parents and has a suspended driver's license. Charming. Heather would lament about how he has so much potential, and asked me how she could help him get his life on track. I started to get the feeling Heather had romantic feelings for him, though she insisted otherwise.

This all came to a head when I had the displeasure of meeting Ricky at Heather's friend's birthday party, which just solidified my disdain for him and raised additional questions. As I'd worried, he turned out to be one of those tall, jacked ""alpha males"" that will barely say a word to a man he perceives as ""beta."" I also overheard him talking to his friends, during which they were speaking a regional dialect known to be used by members of organized crime, which, in combination with his ""profession"" leads me to believe he may have some involvement in that. Aside from that, the way Heather looked at him was just different than the way she looked at me. I noticed her watching him from afar making goo-goo eyes as he and his friends sat in the corner acting like they were superior to everyone else. I also caught Ricky whisper something in Heather's ear as he walked past her, which made her blush and stare at him for approximately 5 seconds straight as he walked away. Although I came as her plus one, Heather said she needed to give Ricky a ride and asked if I'd be cool getting a ride with someone else. I hinted that I'd be willing to come along, but she didn't bite and I ended up taking public transportation.

Now, I'm 99% certain that Heather has feelings for Ricky. The question is, why? By all indications, this is a guy who just can't get his sh\*t together no matter what he does. If you take away his height and his physique, I am the superior partner. I have a good job, make good money, have a similar educational background, am interested in her interests, don't have shady friends, have an actual family, don't start flings with multiple women, and am actually a decent human being. I'm always available when she needs help with work, and sometimes stay up until 3 a.m. listening to her problems and giving her advice. I don't understand why a woman who has beauty, an education, a career, and who isn't a total thot would want some scumbag loser just because he's tall, buff and dresses nice. I would literally do everything in my power to make her the happiest woman alive, while Ricky would probably cheat on her after a week. Although I'm disheartened, I'm not giving up. I understand that the issue isn't with me, it's with Heather needing to see through this guy's bulls\*t and get her priorities straight. So what can I do to help her do just that, and show her that I'm the one worthy of her affection?

TLDR: I'm (28M) in love with my coworker (28F), who seems to be in love with a guy (31M) who's a terrible match for her and doesn't have his sh\*t together.

The father of the little one was very violent and emotionally abusive with them.
His whole familynand community was. 
She left after nearly being beaten to death when pregnant.

What I didn't know (suspected though) is that she kept sending them money because they threatened to sue for custody all the time.

She opened up late about the violence and also told me about the money.
She would go back with the kid every few weeks to let them see the kid.

After she opened up I talked her into sending them less slowly and reduce the money which was nearly all her pay check.

Then problems started.
They took the kid once early this year and would not give it back until she gave them a lot of money.

The second time they just kept the kid completely in the summer and she had to visit the kid there. She was free to come and go but never take the kid.

Violence happened again. She was prisoner indirectly because she could never leave the kid there alone.

She escaped one day they were out for church (yes, they go to church).
She got a protective order and sued for custody.

We are in this battle now.
They kept all her belongings, burned her and the kids papers. 

There is so much pressure on me. 
She often avoids any type of action.
Since she was there she is completely different.
We receive threats on a daily.
I have to keep them safe and I have to somehow navigate her feelings while doing so.

It becomes quite frustrating as it seems like everything triggers her.
She doesn't get abusive but whenever there is something that I get upset about or I need her to do (court papers, stuff for the lawyer, or as simple as installing some safety for the stairs at home so the kid can't climb them which I feel is unsafe and she thinks the kid just does it fine) she turns away, changes the subject or cries especially if I push it.
She had so much confidence and she loses it slowly as I try to have her see that she takes risks and procrastinates too much.

I love them both deeply.
And I wish I could give her time to heal. 
But we need to solve this now or it will affect the rest of our lives.
She comes around sometimes when I tell her the little one will be in this forever but it's hard.
Or when I threaten to leave which I don't and can't do.
And I don't want to do it this way.
She tried a therapist.

And I have so much anger of what she didn't tell me about how bad it was. And also about him and that he got to hurt her while she was mine.
And I can't say any of this to her. She just curls up and cries.

And the more I can't say, the more small things start to bother me and the more I want to say everything and the more I can't.
It drives me crazy and I feel stuck.
Some small issue with papers or if the coffee machine doesn't work she will feel completely defeated.
I tell her I'm scared or consequences if we don't do something and she panics.
If I even remotely say or mention what it feels like that I didn't know what she did (which I understand why) and that she sucked me into something. She completely loses all confidence, feels guilty and like she is the worst person in the world.
And all I want is for her to see how avoiding things and not telling some have got us into this and how we can avoid more stress.",1,1728277431.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False
1fy010t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaliforniaDisasters/comments/1fy010t/sfs_97_degrees_one_of_at_least_10_daily/,S.F.’s 97 degrees one of at least 10 daily temperature records set across Bay Area,"By Greg Porter, Senior Newsroom Meteorologist

Updated Oct 6, 2024 8:03 p.m.

Sunday was the hottest day of the year in San Francisco and the hottest October day in the city in 28 years. The high of 97 degrees set a new daily temperature record for the date as well, one of many records set across the Bay Area on Sunday.

Sunday also marked the third day this month where the city reached at least 94 degrees for a high temperature, a feat that has been achieved just six other times in the city’s history. 

Oakland hit 100 degrees, San Jose topped out at 103 degrees and San Rafael’s high temperature was an eye-popping 107 degrees, all daily records. At least 10 daily temperature records were set across the Bay Area on Sunday. 

• Bay Area heat wave: When will region see relief?

Sunday’s hot temperatures in the Bay Area were a bit of a surprise. A sea breeze failed to materialize as forecast and an offshore wind carried the heat all the way to the coastline. Ocean Beach reached a blistering 94 degrees, while some personal weather stations in the Mission District showed temperatures in the upper 90s and above 100 degrees.

The extreme temperatures were part of a historic heat wave encompassing much of California and the western U.S. On Sunday, daily temperature records were set in Palm Springs, Fresno and Ukiah in California and also in locations in Arizona, New Mexico and Montana. 

Back in the Bay Area, Ocean Beach was bustling with surfers, umbrellas, tents and picnic blankets in the early afternoon. Typical cooling winds off the ocean were nonexistent, as a hot land breeze eroded the marine layer completely. One lifeguard described it as the hottest day since he started working in 2016.

At Dolores Park, people took cover in the shaded areas near the top of the hill, where they sat or lied down on blankets and towels. Some groups pitched tents. A few others set up canopies.

Precious Bowes, 37, went to the park with her friend and her terrier pointer mix to escape the Victorian where she lives. “The sun hits it all day long,” she said as she set up blankets under a tree.

She had a cooler full of Gatorade and water bottles. She intended to sell them, but the heat was too much. “At this point we’re exhausted,” she said.  
Instead she planned to offer free affirmation readings.

San Francisco designated cooling centers at the Main Library, plus the Chinatown, Glen Park, Mission Bay, North Beach and Potrero Hill branches. The Mission District and Potrero branches were closed due to the heat. 

Black Jack Baking Co. in the city’s Bernal Heights neighborhood closed at 2 p.m. Sunday “because it is too damn hot,” the owner posted on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAy9z0OzqCL/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D). 

The [PG&E Outage Map](https://pgealerts.alerts.pge.com/outage-tools/outage-map/) showed power off in a large swath of the East Bay on Sunday, though it was unclear whether the unplanned outages were related to the heat. 

In Oakland, which hit 100 degrees both Saturday and Sunday, power was out at a stretch of homes and businesses in the Montclair neighborhood Sunday afternoon. 

A Montclair nail salon was turning customers away because of the outage, though one client can canceled because of the heat. Nearby restaurant and bar Crogan’s was dark and closed, with a “Power out” sign on the front door. Safeway and Highwire Coffee were without power as well.  


On the same block, an Em Deli employee said that if power wasn’t restore to the Korean restaurant by 5 p.m., it would have to throw out food.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right coffee mug can greatly impact your daily routine. An ergonomic coffee mug is designed with your comfort and health in mind, making every sip enjoyable and easy on your body. Let’s explore the various benefits of using an ergonomic coffee mug and how it can enhance your coffee-drinking experience.

### Enhanced Comfort

One of the primary benefits of an ergonomic coffee mug is enhanced comfort. Traditional mugs may force you to grip them tightly, leading to discomfort, especially during longer sips. Ergonomic mugs feature a shape that fits comfortably in your hand, allowing you to grip them effortlessly. This design reduces strain on your wrist and fingers, making your morning ritual of drinking coffee a pleasurable experience.

### Improved Stability and Safety

An ergonomic coffee mug often has a broader base and may feature non-slip surfaces. This helps to improve stability, reducing the chance of spills. Nobody likes a hot coffee stain on their desk! With a more secure hold and a stable shape, you can enjoy your beverage without the constant worry of it tipping over. This is especially useful if you’re on the go or working at a desk.

### Health Benefits

Using an ergonomic coffee mug can also promote better posture. When you drink from a poorly designed mug, you may have to bend forward or twist your body, leading to discomfort over time. An ergonomic design allows you to maintain a natural and relaxed posture. This not only makes your coffee-drinking experience pleasant but also contributes to your overall spinal health.

### Temperature Control

Many ergonomic coffee mugs are designed with technology that helps regulate the temperature of your drink. Insulated materials keep your coffee hot for longer, allowing you to savor every sip without having to rush. Additionally, some ergonomic mugs have double-walled designs, which prevents the outer surface from becoming too hot to touch. This is a vital point for those who enjoy sipping their coffee slowly.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-mug  
  
### Eco-Friendly Options

When selecting an ergonomic coffee mug, you can find many eco-friendly options available. Many manufacturers focus on sustainable materials, which reduces the environmental impact of disposable mugs. By choosing an ergonomic mug made from bamboo, stainless steel, or other recycled materials, you can enjoy your beverage while being kind to the planet.

### Stylish Designs

Ergonomic coffee mugs come in various styles, colors, and designs. This allows you to express your personality while enjoying your favorite drink. Whether you prefer a classic look or a modern design, there’s an ergonomic coffee mug out there that matches your taste. It can even serve as a conversation starter when friends or colleagues admire its unique shape and functionality.

This ensures that you can maintain good hygiene without spending too much time scrubbing. A clean mug not only makes your coffee taste better but also helps to avoid unwanted bacteria buildup.

### Accessibility Features

How to Choose the Right Ergonomic Coffee Mug for Your Daily Needs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to enjoying your favorite brew, comfort should be a top priority. An ergonomic coffee mug can enhance your coffee experience by providing a comfortable grip and preventing strain on your hands and wrists. Here’s how to choose the perfect ergonomic coffee mug that fits your daily needs.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-mug  
  
### Understand Ergonomics

Ergonomics is all about making everyday tasks easier and more comfortable. When selecting a coffee mug, consider how it will feel in your hand. Look for designs that promote a natural grip and require less effort to hold. This is particularly important if you sip on multiple cups throughout the day or have any issues with hand fatigue.

### Material Matters

Different materials can affect both comfort and functionality. Here are common options:

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-mug  
  
- **Ceramic:** Great for insulation and comes in various designs. However, these mugs can be heavier than others.
- **Stainless Steel:** Durable and keeps your coffee hot for longer periods. They typically feature ergonomic handles that enhance grip.
- **Plastic:** Lightweight and often come with a rubber or silicone grip. Be mindful of temperature retention as plastic may not keep beverages hot for too long.

### Consider Size and Capacity

Not all mugs fit all hands or preferences. The capacity of the coffee mug is important based on how much coffee you usually drink. Choose smaller mugs if you're looking for a more controlled caffeine intake, or larger ones if you love to sip your coffee throughout the morning. A standard size typically ranges from 10 to 16 ounces.

### Grip and Handle Design

The handle of the mug plays a crucial role in comfort. Look for features such as:

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-mug  
  
- **Wide Handles:** Allows for a better grip, especially for those with larger hands.
- **Non-Slip Grip:** Silicone grips or rubberized materials can prevent slipping when your hands are wet.
- **Curved Designs:** Consider a curved or contoured handle that fits your fingers comfortably, allowing for ease in lifting the mug.

### Weight of the Mug

It’s essential to consider the weight of the mug, especially if you plan to carry it around. Lightweight mugs are easier to handle and reduce strain on your wrist. However, heavier mugs may offer better durability and temperature retention.

### Insulation Properties

To keep your coffee at the perfect temperature, insulation is key. Double-wall designs help maintain heat without making the exterior too hot to hold. Look for mugs that specifically mention thermal insulation for optimal performance.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-mug  
  
### Maintenance and Cleaning

Make sure the coffee mug you choose is easy to clean. Many stainless steel and ceramic mugs are dishwasher safe, while some plastic mugs may require hand washing. Reviews often highlight the ease of cleaning, so consider customer feedback on this aspect as well if that's a priority for you.

### Aesthetic Appeal

While functionality is vital, the appearance of your coffee mug can also enhance your enjoyment. Choose a design that reflects your personality. Whether it's a vibrant color or a sleek minimalist style, finding a mug that you love will make you look forward to each cup.

Check Pricing Here: https://itrendworld.com/ergonomic-coffee-mug  
  
### Budget Considerations

It's important to consider your budget. Ergonomic coffee mugs come in a range of prices. Generally, a higher price point may correspond with better insulation, durability, and design, but it’s still possible to find effective ergonomic mugs at affordable prices. Researching options will help you strike a balance between cost and quality.

Choosing the right ergonomic coffee mug can transform your coffee experience. By considering your daily needs and preferences, you'll find a mug that both feels comfortable in your hands and complements your lifestyle. A proper ergonomic coffee mug can benefit your physical comfort and elevate your enjoyment of that daily cup of coffee.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right ergonomic coffee mug can significantly enhance your daily coffee-drinking experience. By investing in a mug designed with comfort in mind, you not only indulge in your favorite brew but also prioritize your health. Ergonomic coffee mugs offer a range of advantages, including reduced strain on your wrists and hands, which can be especially beneficial for those who enjoy sipping coffee throughout the day or work long hours at their desks.

1fy0016,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fy0016,Solo Camping in Southwestern BC,"I only had two nights, and it was so hard to make myself leave this morning. Usually I camp with my family who likes (me) to pack up and leave right away. This morning there was nobody to complain that I was packing too slow. I packed leisurely while enjoying a morning fire, coffee, a walk, a swing in the hammock, and I stayed as long as I could.

The river is called Chehalis River and it’s about 90 minutes drive from Vancouver BC.

Pic 4: I started reading this book awhile ago and finally had time to finish it. It’s an easy, interesting read where the author spends one night in the woods every month, going back to the same place and documenting his thoughts and observations. A perfect camping book.

Pic 5: This wine was delicious and I don’t generally love red wine. It’ll be my new go-to for sure. 

Pic 6: It was cold at night but I was so warm and comfortable. Nothing better than a cozy bed and the cold night & early morning air. Seeing this pic makes me want to bring a lightweight fabric next time to drape along the tent walls & look pretty. 

I don’t get to go camping alone very often. A couple nights a year, usually, so I likely won’t get another chance until next fall. I love camping with friends and family, but I also love being there alone. Dark thoughts sometimes creep in after awhile at the campfire, so I kept things light with an upbeat/chill playlist ( https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Z9un1RpMat8z450i0OYjN?si=XzChk5ZmQhGiI81p6TrJ8A&pi=u-yPB6QwFNRnWD )which, combined with a joint or two, made for wonderfully relaxing evenings where I felt perfectly content in a way that I don’t often experience. It’s so nice to have time where I don’t have to consider the needs and wants of anyone else, and where I can get lost in my own thoughts without being interrupted.

I waited for like 40 minutes, texted him several times, then finally decided it was time to leave. Another 30ish minutes later, he texts me saying that he had been inside waiting for me the whole time (I had waited in my car bc I didn't want to go in and get stuck ordering something if he didn't show) and that his phone had just died as he was trying to text saying he was on his way. It was literally 10 in the morning so obviously I sensed bullshit immediately. Plus who tf leaves the house to meet up with someone with no way to communicate?! Anywho, he apologized, and sent me ""proof"" that he was there (just a pic of a generic ass coffee cup on his coffee table at home). I agreed to try meeting up again in a few weeks and said that I'd like to call a bit between now and then to get a better feel for him. He said okay, and never responded to any more of my texts Wednesday. Fast forward through Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I heard nothing at all from him. I finally got fed up this morning. Told him I have a low tolerance for bullshit and that I don't appreciate being messed with like that, and blocked him on the app we were using to message. I didn't block him on everything fast enough, and almost immediately, he starts blowing up my phone through tinder messages. Begging me to unblock him, that he had been out of town with his family. I don't buy it for a second. Why do people think it is appropriate to continue talking to someone after that? Did my message not convey ""leave me tf alone"" clear enough?? And do yall think it is all bullshit lies??",0,1728276880.0,dating_advice,6,0.5,False

1fxzual,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fxzual/is_my_marriage_already_failing/,Is my marriage already failing?,"My husband (31M) and I (32F) have been married for just over a year and a half. We met and quickly got married within four months. Initially, we were long-distance, and shortly after getting married, he deployed for six months. So, for the first year of our marriage, we were apart for half of it, and before that, we only saw each other a few times a month. Every time we met, it was filled with relief and happiness. We loved spending time together, talking constantly, and being intimate—we were very much in love.

Now, as we approach our second anniversary, we've been living together for almost six months. Since I moved here, we've only been intimate a handful of times, usually when we're away on weekend trips, not at home.

Conversations between us are almost nonexistent. We don’t argue, but it feels like our interests don’t align, and our talks aren’t enjoyable. We live in the same house but often stay in separate rooms, doing our own things.

A couple of months ago, I told him I felt more like a roommate than a wife. He responded by saying, “I’m sorry you feel that way, but why do I always have to initiate things?” That’s not true—I’ve tried initiating, but he often ignores me.

It’s not that he completely neglects me. He’ll occasionally bring home coffee and never forgets holidays or birthdays, which I appreciate. He also helps with some chores, like vacuuming or taking out the trash. I handle making his lunch every day, the groceries, our pets, organizing plans, and working as well.

In some areas, we function well as a team, but most days, we don’t feel like friends anymore. We don’t laugh, have fun, talk, or even touch much anymore.

Is my marriage failing? I feel like I'm just a placeholder...


TLDR:

My husband and I got married quickly after meeting but spent much of our first year apart due to his deployment. Now, after living together for almost six months, we've become distant. We barely talk, intimacy is rare, and it feels like we’re just roommates. He occasionally shows thoughtfulness, but we’ve lost the connection we once had. I’m worried our marriage is failing, and I feel like I'm here just because he doesn't want to be alone.

1fxzr9h,https://i.redd.it/fc1f26iwk9td1.png," ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" — Stephen King","## Making the Most of Life's Precious Moments

Let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately. You know that feeling when you're stuck in a rut, just going through the motions day after day? I've been there, and it got me thinking about how we spend our time on this planet.

Life's a funny thing, isn't it? We're all given this precious gift of time, but sometimes we forget just how valuable it is. We get caught up in the daily grind, Netflix binges, and scrolling through social media. Before we know it, weeks, months, even years have slipped by. But here's the thing – we have a choice. We can choose to really live, to squeeze every drop of excitement and meaning out of our days, or we can just... exist.

Think about it. What makes you feel truly alive? Is it traveling to new places, learning a new skill, or spending quality time with loved ones? Whatever it is, that's where the magic happens. That's where you find those moments that make your heart race and remind you why you're here.

But let's be real, it's not always easy to choose the path of truly living. Sometimes it's downright terrifying. Stepping out of our comfort zones, taking risks, facing the possibility of failure – it can be overwhelming. Yet, isn't that where growth happens? Isn't that how we discover what we're really capable of?

On the flip side, there's the alternative. We can play it safe, stick to our routines, and avoid any challenges. But is that really living? Or are we just marking time, waiting for something to happen?

I'm not saying we need to be constantly doing something extraordinary. Sometimes, truly living means finding joy in the simple things – a perfect cup of coffee, a sunset, a good laugh with friends. It's about being present and appreciating these moments instead of just letting them pass us by.

So, what's it going to be? Are you going to embrace life with open arms, chase your dreams, and create memories that'll make you smile years from now? Or are you going to let life pass you by, always wondering ""what if""?

Look, I'm not here to preach. We all have our own paths to walk. But I will say this – life's too short for regrets. So why not take that class you've been thinking about, tell that special someone how you feel, or finally start that project you've been dreaming of?

Remember, every day is a new opportunity to choose. To choose growth over stagnation, adventure over routine, life over mere existence. It might not always be easy, but I promise you, it's worth it.

So, what do you say? Are you ready to really start living?

1fxzr4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fxzr4g/ghosting_a_queen_bee/,Ghosting a queen bee,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm seeking advice because I'm not proud of what I'm doing, but I'm not sure what to do differently for the outcome I want.

Context: 
I used to be an overly kind, quiet, people pleaser. 

There was a queen bee type girl who latched onto me in like 1st grade. I loved her parents because they were kind, but she was kind of spoiled and not great to be around. Like she'd tell me what to do all the time, talk shit about her dad, undercut my accomplishments and preferences, and try to manipulate me into doing what she wanted because it was her way or she was the victim. 

I didn't do myself any favors. I didn't point these behaviors out many times, and only made small attempts to defend myself, which got brushed off because she played the victim card or acted superior and i was too nice/timid to do anything about it. I also did not reach out or prioritize hanging out with this girl. We didn't even talk in elementary bc we went to different schools, but then middle school reconnected us. She still managed to guilt trip me into cutting off other friend groups because it was ""them or her,"" and she was my ""best friend since 1st grade"" and how could I spend time with those type of people over my best friend? 

Then we graduated and went to different universities, but still in the same area. I always had to find a way to visit her. I didn't initiate these hangouts, but I also could never convince her to visit me or make it more convenient for me (I didn't have a car). It was always like ""we haven't hung out in so long you have to visit!"" So I'd visit and we hung out maybe twice a year. 

Then I graduated college and we didn't talk for a few years. I ended up moving away and then back, and when I came back it was suddenly expected that we hung out monthly if not more. Spending time with her always makes me sour. She still shit-talks her dad, and now various people from our school days and her coworkers (part time retail). She rants about her work day and never asks or responds to what I say unless it's about her stuff. She does not put down her phone and has to check her notifications every 30 seconds. These ""hangouts"" were usually at Starbucks, where she wanted me to pay for our coffees, or at her apartment, where I was expected to help clean piles of dirty clothes and literal trash that built up. I've even had to throw out some of this girl's moldy underwear because it was too gross for her to touch but ""you said you'd help clean, and I'm wearing a skirt and I worked today so I can't reach down!"". I got pretty upset and told her off for treating me like her personal maid and that I didn't enjoy hanging out with her. She got upset and started crying about how no one understands her. I ended up leaving because I was just done and she started tearfully complaining about how awful her boyfriend is at cleaning (her boyfriend who is a carbon copy of her dad, works 50-60hr weeks, pays all their bills, caters to her every whim, and is also an enjoyable nerd to hang out with). 

Now: 
So after that, I tried going low contact/slow fade. We don't have a lot in common and never have. But I have gotten better at being my own person, and it boils my blood to hear her talk so poorly about people who had a reputation for being kind, and people that I didn't even really know in school. Like, I know that what she's complaining about doesn't matter. Her dad's a nerd that likes board games about space. And she has ruthlessly attacked this man for that hobby. Her dad has a group of friends and they play boards games once or twice a month and she HATES it. She doesn't even live at home so I have no idea why it even matters to her. 

Anyway, the low contact was working successfully. We haven't hung out for more than a year, and texts dwindled, to the point that I started taking forever to respond, and it was maybe three months without a text from her. I saw on FB that she got engaged about a month ago. Now she's texting and calling me almost daily, sometime multiple times in a row (often while I'm at work) and I've been ghosting. 

I don't feel proud of it, but I also don't want her back in my life. She has a history of playing the victim card and not changing. What should I do? 

Tldr; I am ghosting a childhood ""friend"" that I don't enjoy spending time with (and never really have). I feel guilty about ghosting, but I don't want her back in my life. Seeking advice or reassurance I suppose",1,1728276332.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1fxzqv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fxzqv8/my_break_up_story/,My break up story,"Hello. I'd like to share my breakup story with you all. I would like to hear everyone's opinion on this.

So I moved to a new town at the start of 2022. I got a job within 2 weeks of living there. I didn't talk to many people at work because they were either weird or we just didn't vibe. Over my first year there many new people started to get hired and I began to make friends and hangout with these people outside of work. Some of them are my really good friends to this day. Anyways about 6 months into 2022 a woman had returned from a leave and she worked in a different area then me so we didn't really speak. 1 day I just started my shift and this woman was working in her station and a guy came up to her and started yelling at her and her responses were very shy and quiet and the guy was being very rude yelling at her. I just continued to work thinking to myself I'd like to punch that guy in the face. A few weeks later I found out this woman and the guy yelling at her are dating, living together and have been together for 6 years. Throughout the year the woman would come help out in my station and we would talk a little bit. Around December of 2022 we became a little bit closer, got into a group chat with her and my friends I met at work who also friends with her. Her boyfriend ended up getting fired around this time but they are still dating and living together. Anyways March of 2023 comes along and she is crying at work a lot and i find out its because her relationship. I guess the guy is really toxic, lazy, they fight all the time, can't hold a job, never cleans snd is letting his bad mental health destroy him. I tried to cheer her up by putting cookies in her locker, putting lottery tickets in her locker snd messaging her positive things to keep her head up and stop her from being upset. Anyways she messaged me asking for a hug at work on lunch which we take outside. At this point I started to hsve some feelings for her. I went outside and I picked her up and gave her a massive hug and just held her in the air for 20 seconds. We talked over text after work and I told her I liked her. She said guys like you don't like girls like me. I'm like to bad I do. She ends up kicking out her boyfriend snd we begin to hangout outside of work. Going to the movies with a group of friends. Going to the bar with our group. Then eventually we plan to hangout at her place. When I go over there I ask her to be my girlfriend and she says yes. So we begin dating in April of 2023.

I would go over there for the full weekend and just sleepover, hangout and do things together. I would go over to her place after work and sleepover and we would just go to work together since we have the same start time. Everything was going amazing and every moment with her was like a dream. We might have the odd minor disagreement about something but it was mainly her getting mad over to me were minor things but other then that everything was going great. So 5 months go by and everything is still going great. I show up to work and she's sitting outside before work opens up and she is crying. So I sit beside her, tell her I love her and kept trying to ask what's wrong  why ar you crying. I kissed her and she would kiss me back but wouldn't tell me what was going on. She wad visibly upset throughout the entire day at work. She says to call her when I get home from work. I go home and I call her and she breaks up with me. She says she needs to work on herself. Get her ducks in a row and get over her ex since she's had no time to deal with the breakup since me and her go together like 2 weeks after there lack luster relationship ended. I was very upset but my only thought in my head was I'm going to het her back. So this is were things begin to get complicated.

2 weeks after our breakup I'm still going to her house for the weekends sleeping together, hanging out like nothing happened. I would still go over some days after work and we would hangout. We would still text everyday like nothing happened. We would go out to the movies, bowling and still do things like we together. Anyways 1 day we were setting up a birthday surprise in October 2023 for our friend we work with. Her phone went off and she asked me go grab it. I grab her phone and I see at the top she has a snapchat from her ex. So I questioned her about it. She told me months ago that he moved away. He was dead to her and sll this stuff. She's like oh we've been talking, we're just friends. Guys and girls and be friends she said. So me, not trying to be controlling or anything just leave it at that. So from October until Jan 1st we are still continuing to have sleepovers, hangout and talk all the time, go to the movies and dinner. So Christmas vacation comes along and on she tells me on December 31st an old friend us getting married and she's going to the wedding. I asked, is your ex going to be there and she's like yeah he will be there. So I immediately just had a very bad feeling about this and new something could happen. So literally 1 day after this wedding she starts to become very distant with me. Not texting me back for hours at a time. Not wanting to hangout. She went from messaging me all these new movies she wanted to watch together to this right after the wedding and I knew something had happened. So after a couple weeks without seeing each other she calls me and says that were no long friends, doesn't want to be intimate with me anymore, I need time to get over her, and I basically bug her and give her no space all the time. I was heartbroken. Literally the next morning I'm in the coffee shop beside work just killing some time before the morning shift starts snd she comes walking in with her ex. The amount of betrayal and anger I felt, words can not describe. Work starts snd I switch my locker that was beside hers to a far away locker and ignore her all day. Next day of work they park outside our work and she gets out and goes into work. We stopped talking at work. I tried calling her and texting her a few times but there was no reply. I figured they were dating again but I didn't know since she hasn't spoken to me. Anyways a few weeks go by where I see her with him every morning and for some reason she starts talking to me and texting me again. We begin to become friends again, we start texting and calling each other everyday and she tells me they are just friends, he moved bsck into town and has been offering to drive her to work. Me not wanting to be controlling or anything just say ok. I end up signing up at a 2nd gym by her place so I can train her and workout with her cause she wanted to get in shape. We started to bond and talk a lot at the gym and were talking at work again. So 1 day a couple weeks later I'm talking sbout movies at work with people and I was telling this guy I haven't seen that movie ill have to check it out. She jumps in on the conversation and says don't watch it, wait! I'm like you want to watch it together? She says yeah. After this she kept telling me movies she wanted to watch with me. So a couple days later were at the gym, I'm like we'll let's set a date ehere you come to my place and watch sll these movies and I'll make you dinner, she says ok and we set a date. The Saturday comes up a week later and I had come down with a bad cold. I said I'd still like to watch movies but I'm a little sick. She's like well my mom is at high risk of getting sick right now and I see her a lot so I shouldn't come. Let's make it next weekend. So I lay in bed sick disappointed and trying to recover for next weekend. The next day she tells me the night she was supposed to come over she ended up going to dinner with her ex. I once again didn't say anything to be controlling. So we planned to have our movie night the next Saturday since I was sick. I get a call on wedscay and she tells me that her and her ex have decided to start seeing each other and see where things go and she can't come over cause it wouldn't be fair to the guy. I got really depressed cause I knew this was going to happen. I just didn't know when. I told her I didn't know if I could workout with her anymore and I don't know what to think right now snd that I had to go. So at work I didn't talk to her that much st first but continued to stay friends with her just incase I could eventually get her back. She would still text me and call me everyday. After about a month of this my birthday was coming up and I invited her to come out with our friends to hsve dinner. We would always hsve s big birthday party for our close friends in our friend group then my birthday came along. She told me she was asked to through a surprise birthday for her boyfriend in January, the day of that wedding so she can't make it. I offered to change to the date to accommodate her but she wouldn't come. I was heartbroken. She told me in the past, when they were together for 6 years he only bought her a gift 1 time and it was a movie he wanted to see. When it was her birthday and we were dating, I have her 200 dollars towards new bras she needed. She ended up buying me a gift and baking me cookies but I wanted her at my birthday. 

So a few days go by and she tells me she wants to end things with him. Things arnt the same as they used to be with him. She kept saying I need to find the right time and doing it when they are parked outside work isn't the right time. This goes on for weeks. Eventually she does end things with him and apparently he agreed things are not the same. One day after she ends things with him she comes up to me and tells me the days she had to walk to work , that apparently he was sleeping in or forgot he was actually at another girls house in a different town sleeping over. So he was cheating on her this entire time on the days he didn't show up to drive her to work cause he was in the next town sleeping with this girl. We talked about it and she was like yeah I'm preparing a goodbye for him and I'm not reaching out to him anymore. 

After this I see my opening and I wait a couple weeks and then ask her to go to the movies and grab dinner and she agrees. So we go out to dinner and see a movie. I then startedd inviting her over to my place to order food snd wstch movies together. And she says yes. So for about 2 months it's like we're back to what we were after we broke up. Talking everyday, hanging out. Sleeping together and just being very close friends. She said I was one of her best friends all the time and I said she is my best friend. So after she leaves my place one Saturday she begins to start acting distant again through text. Taking a long time to reply and seeming like she doesn't want to talk. I invited her over to come over the next Saturday and she agrees. On the friday night she calls me and said she feels sad and just wants to be by herself. I was sad but I was like ok. No problem. Let's do it next weekend. She says ok for sure. So the next weekend she comes over and we go and lay in my bed and put on a movie. She is laying there like a statue not saying much. I try to kiss her and touch her and she isn't having it. She was making weird faces and nit kissing back or anything. I would stop, wait like 20 minutes and try again but it was the same. Eventually she was like, remember when I said I didn't want this to change our friendship, I'm like yeah nothing has changed what do you mean. She's like I don't know if you csn just be friends with me. I was speechless and she said what's wrong. I'm like, I'm just caught off guard, I wish you would have had this conversation with me before coming here. Anyways the conversation ends and we continue watching the movie. I tried to kiss her again and she was still not having it. After I rolled over after trying to kiss her a few times, she gets up and calls a taxi then goes out the door. I chased after her and gave her a birthday card I got everyone I got to sign at work and said I don't know when I'll see you so take this, your presents are in arriving here tomorrow so I'll drop them off. She says ill text you later.

She sends me massive text message ending our friendship. She said the bad outweighs the good with me. I'm draining her. I can't just be friends. And a bunch of other things that were not true it just seemed they we added to the message to help her case of ending the relationship even though were best friends. She deleted me off social media. I texted her and called her right away to talk things out but there was no reply. So her presents arrived at place and her birthday was on Thursday and it's Monday right now. She left a bunch of of stuff at my place so I got her things together and her gifts and texted her. Hey I'm going to drop off all your stuff the day before your birthday you've left her and the gifts I ordered you that I've been telling you about for weeks now. There was no reply. So I go to her place and I drop off the gifts at the time I said I'd be there. When I got there I could tell something was uo because all the curtains were open which was strange since there always closed. So I drop off the gifts then as I'm leaving a man emerges from the back of the place she lives at. I recognized him. It was her best friends boyfriend. He says can I have a word with you. I'm like ok. He says to me, it doesn't matter what you do or say, she isn't talking to you ever again. I'm like ok, I was just dropping off stuff she left at my place and her gifts, I'm not here to talk to her. He says I don't fu**ing care, leave now or I'm calling the cops and if I see you here again I'm calling the cops. I'm like did you want me to throw her stuff in the garbage. She even said to me when we were still talking she wanted all this stuff back he's like. Leave now or I'm calling the fu**ing cops! I'm like you stopped me from leaving man chill out. He continued to swear at me and I left. I got home and I was like what the heck just happened?? She must have told this guy to come talk to me cause he emerged st the exact time I said I was coming and the curtains were open. After 2 weeks I tried to call her but realized my number is blocked. She is on leave so she's not at work l. Mlim blocked on social media. I tried calling her once a week for a month to see if my number was blocked and it still was. 

So a month and a bit after this. I posted some photos of me and her on social media that we took when we just friends because I was missing her a lot. 5 days after posting these photos I woke up to a comment on the photos from one of her friends that I don't even have on my social media. They commented saying stop posting, stop calling, she wants to do with you. You ate stalking her. You have been warned twice now. If you post or csll again, I'm calling the police.

After this I have not tried reaching out to her since. I thought this was my bestfriend. This is someone who I've been there to support the entire time I've known them with there mental health and personal problems. She told me like 2 weeks before this fallout happened, don't let this go to your head but I love you. You and my mom are the only people who are always there for me. So the treatment from this woman towards me feels like betrayal. It feels like I was thrown to the curb like trash. It's been almost 3 months now and I just learned some new information. Her ex is back in the picture. I don't know of there dating or what but I have a good feeling there is something going on there. Last time she kicked me out of her life was because of him so I'm coming to the realization its probably because of him again.

My heart is broken behind repair. I'm a broken man. I don't think if it's even worth looking for someone ever again because the heartbreak takes years snd years to recover. This is going to haunt me the rest of my life.

When I am out with coworker/friends for drinks I get club soda, Diet Coke/Ginger, Shirley Temple (with Diet Coke instead of Sprite, 10/10 drink) or Red Bull.

We'll go out for dinner and drinks after work soon and the place we will go has NA Corona on the menu. I kinda want to try it but am worried that I won't like it. How would you describe the taste to a non-drinker?

tldr:
Pour over with only a paper filter, good or  bad idea? Tips? Recs? Low cost, low effort. 

I am just starting to casually play around with pour over style coffee. I have a gooseneck kettle (target clearance) and basic paper coffee filters. 

I have been using a tall metal tumbler and placing a paper filter over the top of that. Then I add my ground coffee to the filter and pour hot water from kettle onto grounds. Coffee drips directly into my tumbler and then I add ice and cream for an iced coffee. I am trying to get fairly strong flavor and about 6 to 8 fl oz of coffee before ice and cream. 
 
I cant find any info on this ""technique"" and am not sure if there are any disadvantages of making pour over coffee this way. 

I'm still experimentaing with my prefered amount of grounds, water temp., pour technique, etc. I'm looking to have a very low cost and low maintaince pour over routine. I like the idea of just using a paper filter and a tumbler. Less dishes, less clutter and less cost. 

Thoughts or tips? Not looking to spend much more money on tools/equpments, but am willing if it is going to improve quality noticeably.

I'm a 27/f, who just moved across the country from the south to the pnw. I am struggling a lot right now and could really use someone kind to chat with. 

A bit of back story, 

I recently moved to the PNW this year after going through a separation. It's been about 2 years since we separated, but we have a kid together and we're roommates. Really good friends, and coparents, no romantic feelings involved on either end, just wanted different things out of life. 

But I'm struggling to put myself out here in this new city to meet people. I don't have any friends here, and I've been here for a year. I get social anxiety going out and meeting people, and I've been on a few very casual dates. I am no contact with my family, and besides my ex wife I have no one. I spend most of my time in my room playing video games as I recently lost my job but will start a new one in a few weeks. 

Y'all, I'm really lonely honestly. I just need someone to chat with and to be able to talk and vent about what's going on in my life. 

Outside of that stuff, I really enjoy playing PC games, reading romance and horror books, going to the book store and put for coffee and hanging with my cat.

I am new to 3D Printing and have designed my first model. I am printing a cradle that slides on to my Timemore black mirror coffee scales (can be seen in photos). In my test prints of just the base and rails its fine, perfect.

However I'm having a hard time trying to get this full print going, I've tried both draft and higher quality print, different materials etc and every time for some reason or another the side walls of my rails are printing less than the width of the model. The model width is 143mm, but for some reason it prints them 142.5mm and the surface 143mm as intended and it's doing my head in! I've tried both tree and normal supports also.

Anyone experienced similar? Or might know the cause.
