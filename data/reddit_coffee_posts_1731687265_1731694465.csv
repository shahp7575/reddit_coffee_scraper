Smith","Welcome back to November’s Poetry Corner. As you probably know, we are doing a [**Discovery Poetry Read**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1glrdbd/schedule_november_discovery_read_life_on_mars_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) later this month of *Life on Mars* by [**Tracy K. Smith (1972-)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_K._Smith), our category winner. So, in case you would like a taste of what this contains, this month I am featuring one of her poems from this collection.

Having served as the 22nd Poet Laureate of the United States in 2017-2019, with roots in literary pedagogy, Tracy K. Smith gives us a taste of the all too human by looking at life from 34.8 million miles away, the closest Earth and Mars are due to be in [**2237**](https://www.space.com/16875-how-far-away-is-mars.html). Her collection, *Life on Mars,* was written in the shadow of her father’s death. He was an engineer who worked on the [**Hubble Space Telescope**](https://hubblesite.org/). The poetry collection has roots in the Sci-Fi world of ideas began in the 1940’s and other explorations of the future from the past, in art and movies.

Born in Massachusetts, she grew up in California and traced family roots to Alabama, returning to the east coast of the United States to get her degree at Harvard University, followed by a MFA in Creative Writing at Columbia University. She is the author of five prize-winning poetry collections, including her 2011 collection, *Life on Mars,* which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 2012. Besides these, Smith has taught writing and judged poetry competitions, as well as written a memoir, a manifesto, worked as a translator and editor and librettist. In her personal life, Smith is married to retired psychiatrist, [**Ralph Allison**](https://www.dissociation.com/) and they have 3 children.

It is interesting to trace three major influences of previous Poetry Corner to her, including [**Rita Dove**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/150kvai/poetry_corner_july_15_persephone_fallinghades/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)**,** [**Federico García Lorca**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1c52frq/poetry_corner_april_15_dream_walkingsomnambulist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)**,** naming her 2007 collection *Duende* and [**Emily Dickinson**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1arbdfq/poetry_corner_february_15_wild_nightswild_nights/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Tory Jollimore reviewing *Life on Mars***""***…making use of images from science and science fiction to articulate human desire and grief, as the speaker allows herself to imagine the universe”***- (**[**link**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_K._Smith)**)**

 

Another critic, Dan Chiasson, notes *""The issues of power and paternalism suggest the deep ways in which this is a book about race. Smith’s deadpan title is itself racially freighted: we can’t think about one set of fifties images of Martians and sci-fi comics, without conjuring another, of black kids in the segregated South. Those two image files are situated uncannily close to each other in the cultural cortex, but it took this book to connect them***”. (**[**link**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_K._Smith)**)**

**By Tracy k. Smith**

 

**When some people talk about money**

**They speak as if it were a mysterious lover**

**Who went out to buy milk and never**

**Came back, and it makes me nostalgic**

**For the years I lived on coffee and bread,**

**Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday**

**Like a woman journeying for water**

**From a village without a well, then living**

**One or two nights like everyone else**

**On roast chicken and red wine.**

Some things to discuss might be to address the title-how would you define it, how does the poem define it and what role does nostalgia play in shaping the idea of it? While this particular poem doesn’t address the idea of outer space or space travel, what link do you think nostalgia plays in creating a picture of the future from the past? What scenes or lines are interesting to you? Can you see any of our previous Poetry Corner poets intersecting with this poem? If you previously read the Lorca Poetry Corner, how do you like the Bonus Poem? Will you join us for the Discovery Read later this month?

1gs2llk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gs2llk/am_i_over_reacting_for_not_rescheduling_after_my/,Am I over reacting for not rescheduling after my date cancelled on me.,"I (29M) have recently been seeing someone (27F). She is good looking, witty with good sense of humor but most importantly, our vibes match. 

Let me add, nothing is official yet. 

We met in an academic setting and after we parted ways she reached out and asked to meet for a coffee. Everything went great and she said she had a great time and would like to see me again. We both know nothing much about each other. All she knows about me is that I have a corporate finance background and I am a research student, that's all. I liked to keep it that way because I need more time with her before I give her the full access of what is going on in my life. The issue is, I am highly organized and I have to be, because I provide consultations to venture capitalists, banks and other companies in various business affairs and I am also working on my postgraduate degree. So my schedule is always full. However, I still realize how important it is to have someone special in your life and I want to have that seriously. 

So, I called her and asked her to get together over dinner. She said yes and based on my calendar I had Saturday and Sunday evening free when I asked my secretary. So after discussing it with this girl we finalized Sunday evening. One important thing, when I meet a woman I organize everything personally. I ask for suggestions not help. So, despite my busy schedule I managed to plan everything I.e. location, entertainment and food. I shared my plans with her and she was happy about it. However, one day before our date I shared details of our complete evening with booked restaurant and everything. She cancelled, saying she had change of plans for Sunday. But she is available on Saturday - let me add, she doesn't work and YES she apologized. However, unfortunately, because she agreed on Sunday, I scheduled my Saturday evening with my shareholders to discuss the business model in more detail, for a new venture we are starting together. This meeting is very important for me. Therefore, I cannot cancel it. Plus, I would look untrustworthy in the eyes of my shareholders. 

I honestly have no time for this but I am trying to do it. I feel this was irresponsible on her part. If I make a commitment I stick to it, that's my absolute principle. I am not angry about it because life is unpredictable. But I am not happy about it either. Unless it's a life or death situation for me, I don't cancel on my plans with anyone especially not when you are one day behind. This incident is making me reconsider pursuing this relationship. 

I want to know If I am over reacting or not? Should I tolerate this? ",2,1731694036.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

","I don’t know if anyone will actually see this, but I have to get it out somewhere before I implode. There’s this HOT guy who’s so far out of my league it’s almost laughable. I see him all the time – in SMU, around campus, sometimes even at the gym – and he’s like this gravitational force I can’t help but orbit.

He’s stunning, yeah, but it’s not just that. It’s the way he looks so focused when he’s studying, like he’s on a mission to solve the world’s problems or something. And then there’s this shift when he’s with his friends – that easy smile, the way his laugh fills the room. It’s deep and genuine, and I swear it’s the best sound I’ve ever heard. I don’t know his name, or his major, or even what year he’s in, but I’m convinced he’s pretty much perfect.

I’ve tried making excuses to get close to him – I once saw him heading to the library, so I grabbed a random book just to follow him in. Another time, I noticed him going into the bathroom, and I actually waited around until he was at the urinals, just so I could pretend to be washing my hands when he walked out. Yeah, I know it’s desperate, but for that brief moment, our eyes met, and he gave me this polite, almost confused smile before leaving. It’s pathetic, I know, but it’s the highlight of my week.

Then there was the time I saw him playing pickleball very gracefully with intense focus and rapid reflexes. I stood there watching, mesmerized, and I immediately signed up for pickleball classes hoping one day he'll notice me.

I know, I know – this probably sounds sad and obsessive, right? And yeah, it’s not like I’m entitled to his attention, or that he owes me anything just because I’m caught up in my own feelings. But every time I see him, it’s this mix of pure awe and total frustration because I know it’ll never be more than that. He’s on his own path, doing his own amazing things, and I’m just… here. Existing in the same space and feeling completely overwhelmed by it.

I don’t know if I’ll ever have the courage to actually talk to him, and even if I did, what would I even say? “Hey, I’ve been secretly following you around campus, watching you play sports, and you’ve single-handedly ruined every standard I ever had in a relationship. Want to grab coffee sometime?” It’s absurd. He’s the sun, shining so brightly, and I’m just some asteroid floating around, hoping for a bit of his light.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you did. I just needed to vent because this guy has me feeling things I haven’t felt in years, and I have no idea how to handle it.",0,1731693926.0,halifax,4,0.15,False
1gs2ize,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gs2ize/quitting_coffee/,Quitting coffee,"I have been dealing a great deal with anxiety last few years and I stumbled across this article that mentioned drinking coffee could greatly increase anxiety levels. I have been drinking around 6-7 cups a day the last 10 years - and without really studying the topic I quit cold turkey on 30-10-2024. First week felt, unlike many others experience, great. I had good sleep and anxiety levels dropped almost immediate. Missed the taste and started drinking decaf and my anxiety levels started rising again - and it kind of destroyed my gut, which negatively impacted my anxiety. So I am quitting decaf as well from today onwards. 

  
However, I do start feeling some weird side-effects such that I for one week straight now have been waking up at 3 am every night and I can't find much on this topic anywhere but this community on reddit. 

I hope someone who have studied this topic or tried it on his/or hers body could enlighten me on a few questions:

1. Will I sometime soon go back to being able to sleep 8 hours straight. I really enjoy the feeling on anxiety levels but struggle with not getting my sleep in.

2. Any reason decaf gives me some bad side-effects?

3. Would it better for me to start drinking 1 cup of coffee in the morning to get back to a normal sleep schedule and hopefully one cup doesn't give me anxiety side-effects and a bad gut.

All experiences and recommendations is more than welcome! I have tried many things but this is by far the biggest effect on my anxiety I have tried in the last two years and who should have thought its coffee!",1,1731693867.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

A friend is currently living with us due to difficulties at home. We are all post-college adults. Two bedroom home so guest and roommate swap who uses the bed and who sleeps on couch. I keep my room. This has been a repeated and long-standing arrangement— she usually stays for a month then goes back home. This happens maybe twice a year.

We are happy to help the friend out even if it means increased difficulty for us, which it does. Trying to juggle people in a small home isn’t always easy, especially because she has different dietary needs then myself and roommate (my roommate and I buy communal groceries together.) 

The friend notably does not have much money. She was on government assistance for a while but that is currently unavailable. We buy groceries for this friend per her dietary needs and preferences. This does add about 20-25% to our grocery bill.

 Notably, we do not ask friend to pay rent/other expenses because she doesn’t have money and we’d happily provide a safer/better place for her to stay short-term regardless of ability to pay. 

But she likes to order in food for herself—at least every other day if not every day. We don’t ask to be included but they also do not offer. Sometimes this is her own money but sometimes others (not in household) purchase the meals for her. 

Therein lies the minor frustration that I’m not sure is justified— she spends the little money she does have ordering in food. It feels sort of like if she has money to order in then perhaps she should offer to pay some towards gas, groceries, etc. It is well known that she’s not the best with money. I believe my roommate is also a bit peeved but accepts the situation. 

Here are my hang ups:
-we have not asked for payment because of the circumstances and because she genuinely has less than $100 in her bank account at any time— she has to check before buying even a coffee.
-it feels hypocritical to be annoyed over something we haven’t told her directly 
-safety and wellness at her original home is a concern at times but she cannot move out for multiple reasons 
-sometimes others are purchasing the food for her and we don’t know which is which 
-she cannot work a full time job
-we do truly like this friend and care about her. This doesn’t change that.
-I’m prone to crankiness

I've been very lucky in the dating world so far. I have a lot of opportunities to meet men and I find that I'm often approached so I've never needed to make the first move and open myself to potential rejection. While this is comfortable and safe, it's also becoming pretty limiting. In the past few months I've come across a few men that have piqued my interest but I didn't have the courage to approach. I had hoped that they would approach me but they didn't, and they now feel like missed opportunities.

As an example, there's someone now in one my massage therapy courses who I find really attractive and would love to get to know more. He was looking for a model to practice his technique on and I turned him down with some sort of excuse because I was too nervous to engage with him. We've also had a few opportunities where we've been alone together (usually waiting for the coffee machine) and I can usually only squeeze out a sentence or two before I panic and make an excuse to leave. I'm starting to see that things will never go anywhere as long as I keep turning into a hot mess whenever he's around. It's especially frustrating given I'm usually a very confident person except when there's potential rejection involved.

My kid is almost 4 so while everyone needs a village I'm pretty far removed from the trenches of new parenthood. And with that distance came perspective - I saw my brand new parenthood months flash before my eyes of me trying desperately to cling to any friendship I had and beating myself up over not putting in enough effort to maintain them while trying to adjust to a new normal. And I remembered a couple people telling me not to worry about it when I'd apologize for not being more present with them and how guilty I felt. But now I am on the other side and I want to tell you what I told my friend: it's not your job to maintain those friendships right now. 

Again.


It's not. Your job. To maintain. Those friendships. Right now. 

It's my job. 

You are taking care of a whole ass new person. All of your time and energy is going into keeping a person alive and trying to keep yourself alive on top of that. In this first year it feels like the whole world outside of your kid evaporates and you're alone, you don't need to be worried about what other people are doing. 

It's my job as your friend to check in on you, to text you, to see what you need, to put the effort into the friendship and keep it alive because you have more important things to be doing than beating yourself up over not asking me how my day was when you're grappling with bills and doctors appointments and illness and work or overwhelming stay at home parenthood. 

People lose friends when they have kids, but I need to make sure you understand it's not you. It's not your kid. The real friends you want to keep are the people who value your friendship even when you can't meet them halfway.

For example, I work as a cook in a nursing home and occasionally I will take condiments if I need them, some buns, coffee packets or creamers if I didn’t have the money. Or I might take something small if I need it for a recipe because I don’t want to buy a huge thing and end up wasting it on one meal. Plus, any food we have left at the night is fair grabs and my manager is pretty okay with it. 

The reason I ask because I told my roommate not to worry about getting two things from the store (buns and ketchup) when I could literally grab them at work. She texted back and said: please do not steal 🙏 - lol, but I work there!!  😂",0,1731693368.0,KitchenConfidential,6,0.25,False

1gs2aio,https://www.reddit.com/r/duluth/comments/1gs2aio/cozy_places_to_read/,Cozy Places to Read,"Hopefully not too odd of a question, but my friends and I used to go to the Canna Lounge to kick back with some beverages, catch up, and read our books. We loved the low noise, comfy seating (I cannot express how crucial this is), and often got drinks there and brought our own food in since that was allowed. To be clear, they didn’t offer much besides chips and salsa, but we would have no issue purchasing food and drinks from a business that had options. Now that they are closed, we’re struggling to find another place that matches the vibe. Any suggestions? 

Some places we have already ruled out: Dovetail Cafe, Wussow’s, The Loch, and 190. All great places, but not for this purpose. 

Places like Perk Place, Dunn Brothers, and most of the Caribou Coffee locations are okay, but only have a few comfortable seating options so they’re hit or miss.

I thought she was my best friend. Clearly I wasn’t hers.
It got dark, drinking a lot, skipping work to stay in bed 18 hrs a day (I’m the owner so I didn’t get fired), borderline suicidal but I have kids (she doesn’t) and I thought I pulled it together, got in therapy.
Talking to my therapist yesterday I told her I’m actually relieved the relationship is over. I’m angry with how it ended, but understand it’s mor me about her finding a life she wants than it is about hurting me. And I’m okay with that, sort of.
I’m happy, I told my therapist, and I am a lot of the time. But I’m doing things in new relationships that aren’t okay and I never would have done before. I’m ghosting women after a couple dates, been seeing one who wants to be exclusive and I said ok, then a week later met someone in a bar for a one night, last night a told a woman with kids who’s into me that I’m single and into them, and set up a date. I’m on my way to have coffee with a woman I know is in a long term relationship. Today I pulled over on the side of the highway to cry. I’m lying to my therapist because I’m embarrassed by what I’m doing, and I want a semi to blow through a red light and clip me on my motorcycle.

This just isn't true, I don't think Tony and AJ have very much in common, and there's one main reason why, Johnny Soprano.

Johnny trusted Tony in his youth, he trusted him to lie for him to Livia, and he trusted him to kill the bookie at 22 years old, but Tony does not trust AJ. AJ's main personality traits are being unhappy and periodically having an uninformed ethical crisis. His unhappiness (and two panic attacks) draw parallels with Tony, but ultimately they're not similar people, because if they were they'd be somewhat of a team by the later seasons.

Tony's broadly an unhappy guy, but I don't think even at AJ's age he'd be the type of guy to cry in a coffee shop about his girlfriend with a kid leaving him. Also, I don't see AJ as the type of son who's gonna be there in a meaningful way for Carmela after Tony's death, especially if she goes full depressed like Livia.",1,1731692910.0,thesopranos,9,0.67,False

I made a list of some of my favourite places to eat at instead,"For the price we pay, I just don't think the quality or service is there anymore. I've had quite a few rude interactions as well. Dash coffee is overpriced and it's kinda watery. Pangeas is a mess and the line up at lunch is awful. Haven't tried elements but I assume it's the same thing. The cafeteria in the 4th floor used to actually have some good food before they became that weird vegan place, then smoothie place, and eventually closing down completely. While I understand they're sourcing their ingredients locally, it feels like they care more about keeping up with this eco conscious reputation than providing good, affordable food to university students. I've made a list of food places around the university that I like to eat at and wanted to share with you all.

Banh Mi King – Classic UOW staple located right across from the university. Great, affordable, delicious Vietnamese food with vegetarian options.
Food recommendations: Veggie rolls, any of their rice dishes, Vietnamese iced coffee

Fresh Slice Pizza – Affordable pizza just across the street. I recommend adding parmesan and oregano and other toppings for more flavour though. They always have deals through their app as well.

Les Saj – Great Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. Portions are big too.

Little Korea – great place for some Korean food. A little bit of a wait if you are dining in and can take long to prepare for pick up, but you can just order early on Skip and pick it up. Prices have gone up since then but still a great place to get Korean food. Portions are big and shareable. Side dishes are included and taste yummy.
Food recommendations: Bibimbap, spicy toppoki

Shaba Thai – Thai food near the university. Hours are a bit later though. They are typically opened 4PM-10PM.
Food recommendation: Crab Rangoon, green curry Thai soup

Feast Café Bistro – Have not tried this place yet but have heard some really great things. They have specialty Indigenous dishes such as Bison meat.

Sargent Taco – Authentic Mexican food. Their tacos are delicious. Not much seating available but very friendly people.

Gato – Cute, little café with coffee and specialty pastries. They always change up their pastries as well so you could try different things each week.

Umaido Mochi Donuts – Delicious donut café with some drinks. Very cute inside and you can watch them make the donuts. Lots of seating, probably a nice place to study too.

Myrna’s Café – Awesome place for Filipino food, especially Filipino breakfast. Parking can be hard sometimes.
Food recommendation: Tapcilog or Tocilog.

Viva Restaurant – Another Thai restaurant. Haven’t tried it yet but also heard some good things.

Chosabi – haven’t got to try anything I wanted from because they never had ingredients available, but it is an option.

Harveys – Right across from Richardson College. Haven’t tried this either but haven’t made time to go. Always seem to have student deals as well.

La Farina – Also right across from Richardson College. Another great place for pizza. They also have smaller individual sized pizzas. Lots of options.

Greenish – located in the Portage Place sky walk. Cute, smaller Korean restaurant. Pretty affordable. They have soup, rice bowls, sushi as well.

Sushi June – located in City Place. It’s about a 15-minute walk if you can navigate the skywalk via Portage Place. Friendly workers too.

Soup, Sandwiches, and More – so many sandwich and wrap options. They also have daily soup options. They can have a long line, but I find everyone gets served super quick. Workers are super nice and attentive as well. Lots of seating, they also have some couches near the back.

Mooshiro – Awesome sushi place. They have a new tablet for ordering food. All you can eat sushi for under $40 but the rolls are really good and worth it rather than a la carte if you can eat lots.
Food recommendations: torched salmon

Hargrave Market – lots of good food places. A bit more expensive and a little bit of a walk but it’s not too far. You can also take the skywalk via Portage Place if you really don’t want to walk outside but it’ll take a little longer. Mottola grocery has good hot and cold table options that change weekly so you can try something new every week. Price is by weight.

Pho Hoang and Pho Que Hoang – More great Vietnamese places to eat.

Panda Tea – good bubble tea that knows how to do the basics well.

Xing Fu Tang – located on Smith, a little bit further but the walk is doable. Great bubble tea options and their bubbles have taste. Cool fortune telling sticks too. They have some pastries for sale too.

Thom Bargen – cute café. Can get a little crowded as people will study there. They close early at 4PM.

Other

Subway – just right across from the university. Easy, simple sandwiches.

Tim Hortons – one block away from the university, there’s also one in Portage Place

Subway – right across from the university.

Portage Place – the mall has options like A&W, Thai Express. I would stick to the brand name food places.

Polo Park – 10-minute drive from the university and lots of general food options.

Stella’s – I’m kinda iffy about recommending this because their prices have skyrocketed immensely. But it’s still a place to get food.

1gs24e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gs24e6/adhd_correlation_to_anxiety_depression_symptoms/,ADHD Correlation to Anxiety & Depression Symptoms Question,"hello, i’ve never posted on a reddit thread before and tbh i’m kinda scared to, but i genuinely do value the info/anecdotes that i find on things like r/adhdwomen bc it gives me a space to hear ppl’s personal experiences & tips, rather than looking at a bunch of stats in a research study which don’t help with this kind of issue. 

i was recently diagnosed about a year ago now (ADHD + ASD) and have struggled with anxiety and depression for years. something i’ve wondered for a long time, especially post-diagnosis, is whether or not some of my struggles with anxiety are actually more a symptom of the ADHD/ASD due to low dopamine or something. 
to clarify, in this specific instance, i’m referring to an experience i often have, where i’ll be going about my day, nothing is wrong, my environment is calm, & i’m even in a good mood. then, out of nowhere, i’ll get this sudden, intense, overwhelming feeling of dread/hopelessness - the closest thing i can compare it to is like seeing a dementor in harry potter. it legit feels like all the happiness has been sucked out of not only me, but the entire world, and i feel like i’ll never be happy again. other times it’s less depression/hopelessness and more like sudden feelings of absolute panic and terror, despite no identifiable trigger. the weirdest part is that it often fades away within a few minutes to, at most, an hour. then i feel fine again. 

i don’t understand what this means or how to stop/cope with it, but i have to imagine it relates to neurodivergence somehow, bc i’ve also noticed that getting a lil treat (like coffee) helps to stop all those feelings - so i’m just bribing my brain with a big dopamine hit. do others experience this? if so, is this a normal experience for those diagnosed with ADHD and/or ASD? or could it be related to something else? 
at the end of the day, i don’t use reddit as a place for medical advice, but i’ve had rotten luck with the past couple therapists & psychiatrists i’ve had, and i haven’t felt safe/okay to fully open up and have a thorough discussion about these feelings, as well as what they mean/how to handle them. so this is where anecdotal info from reddit comes in handy, bc i don’t need someone to prescribe me more pills or psychoanalyze me, i want to hear ppl’s personal experiences to see if any of them resonate with me/this issue. 

hope i did this right, idk what the rules are for reddit threads/communities, but any tips/insight is always appreciated :)",1,1731692845.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

She met a guy in the gym and they became good friends.They go out for coffee everyday after her office or after gym and calls everday at night. I was really insecure about this at first but figured out my way through it and understood my anxious behavior. She never has displayed any type of cheating behavior and tells me everything between them and I honestly believe there's nothing between. But it did take me some time to get around all this and to understand my anxious behavior. Did figure it out at the end and was all over the thing.

I wfh and my office is based out of her city.Today I went there and decided to stay there with a friend do I can go out with her dinner.Told her everything and she was up for the idea and told I will pick her up after her office.But due to some other problems I couldn't go to her office.I thought she could come and pick me up after office as she has a vehicle.She got upset about me not coming and suddenly told the plan is off and she Is going to workout.She told me we could go after gym which will be after 9:30 and her parents probably won't allow.

I became upset tha she suddenly changed all our plans and decided to go and workout when I was out here waiting for her to come pick me up.

After sometime I called her and she was busy and she returned my call and told me we could meet at 8 and go out.i was like so ur not going to gym but u want to meet after 8..didn't make sense to me..

So I waited for her and she came to pick me up..turns out she went to have coffee with this guy...i was visibly upset and frustrated for the fact that she immediately after our small debacle went to call the guy and took her time to drink coffee with him whereas me her bf was waiting for her alone.

Told her all this and she immediately accepted her mistake and told me a million sorrys and all..but I don't know how to feel about this..I don't know what to do..I don't know what to say to her...

I am still very upset and disturbed about the fact that she went for coffee with the guy and made me wait. I don't know how to go forward with this ..help me",21,1731692821.0,Coconaad,23,0.96,False

I do want to play with different coffees, extraction methods, etc.  To give an idea of the breadth of machines: Profitec Move is my current favorite, Ascaso Steel Duo, Decent (yes, another price point, but the engineer in me loves the idea), Gagguino (engineer and scrooge in me) ,and even an ECM Synchronika II (quieter, should have awesome steam power, but I'm not a big fan of the E61 look).

So, to the question, is there any comparable data about steaming power?",2,1731692649.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

So I've recently seen this girl a couple times that I met through Hinge a couple of weeks back. We met late because she works in theatre and doesn't finish until 10.30pm. 

We had can amazing first date, stayed out until 2am, made out a lot etc She texted later to say thanks and said she wanted to see me the week after. 

I called a day later and arranged a date for following week. We went to an art gallery and a lovely walk and had some coffee before I dropped her off at work. Again, lots of making out, loads of laughing, great convo, touching and hand holding- it just felt really natural and she is a very passionate kisser tbh. 

I knew vaguely that she we was gonna be super busy before she goes home for the holidays etc. But when I dropped her off and I asked 'when am I seeing you next week?' she said that it can't be until january when she is back in town. But she said I can call her anytime and that she wants to hear how my job interview goes next week. 

Now of course, this was a little disconcerting I suppose, because it is a little hard to believe that anyone is that busy for the next month and a half, especially considering how natural and affectionate the dates seemed. I have dated a lot of women this year, and I can tell there is a really high attraction level between us, nothing imo that would suggest otherwise. 

  
I know I am probs overthinking this, but do you think she is actually really that fucking busy? Or is she just making distance? Who knows?

Thoughts?

Diagnosed schizophrenic and bipolar at age 7. Been on just about everything out there. Currently because of my previous history of 'extremely violent reactions to unrelated stimuli' thanks to my bipolar type 1, out of the 20 pills I take every day, 11 of them are meant to keep me artificially calm and collected and that's great news for all the non living things in my life but it doesn't stop the hallucinations both audio and visual that are like... just always there. It just minimizes my reaction most of the time. But lately it's so intense that I am reacting, and then have to play it off like haha I'm such a klutz. Instead of in my mind where I'm trying to rationalize what I'm seeing and I know they are not real. My dad died 20 years ago. My mom died 29 years ago. But I will open the bathroom door to go potty and there's my father, with a switch as big as my thumb from a willow tree. And it's just so... unexpected. Freaks me out. But what am I supposed to say? Without my SSDI we're broke. I can't go back to work. I wish I could. When my wife goes to bed I spend hours just staring at her, watching her face change before my eyes. I know she is not some demon but I can't help it. I have never in my life wanted to self harm as bad as I do now. I want to damage my eyes and my ears so that I can just have true quiet. I'm barely eating. Not because I'm not hungry. I'm starving. It's hard to put into words. If I pour a bowl of cereal with some milk, I can't eat more than one piece of cereal at a time because it's like either my throat got smaller or the food somehow got bigger, and once that's happened, it's a huge fight to eat anything. Most days I have a couple of cups of coffee, I down almost 2 liters of water a day and I buy a lot of ensure bottles because I can drink them with no problem.

But at the end of the day, I'm just...I don't want to exist anymore. I hate this place. I hate this time. I hate, most importantly, not knowing whether something in my memories is really real and what's simply my mind being wrecked by the various afflictions I've been 'blessed' with.",4,1731692284.0,schizophrenia,1,1.0,False

I think my original basket is 16g capacity but is already touching a little bit the shower screen screw with 14g in, so I consider it’s 14g

For now all my shots are very sour, and impossible to get the 14g recipes right.
Desired result : 14g in, 35g out (x2.5 ratio), 30sec 

I have the feeling that dialing in is almost impossible because the steps are so big between each click.

Few steps coarser and the coffee pours like water and the shot is finished before 15-16 seconds, few clicks finer and it literally clogs up the machine.

I managed once to get a decent result, at setting 3 of the grinder, but just next time completely different result

So, could my puck prep be so much wrong that my shots are just crazy or is my grinder at fault ?

Is changing the grinder so quickly a good idea or should I try to work it out if that’s possible ?

I was considering changing for the DF54, because of the price (260€ new). But not available on Amazon in my country at the moment.

I have the possibility between DF64 (449€ new on Amazon), Eureka Mignon Specialita (319€ used from 2020 or Eureka Mignon Turbo (450€ used from 2022)

**Summary**: We're making a coffee table with book shelving around the outside. When a specific (secret) book is pulled, a hidden compartment will be raised out of the center.

[Testing the weight limit for the mechanism](https://preview.redd.it/cj6zhvg4n31e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fe6b71484c8e006ee5da42b175cd4bea4d0c006)

This is where we're having trouble. 

**Requirements:** Given our table's dimensions, we're trying to fit the lifting mechanism to a total height of 5.5 inches. Our compartment is 8 inches tall, so we need to be able to move 8 inches. 

**Current thing (that doesn't work):** This current 3D-printed mechanism has like 9.5 inches of movement and does fit within the 5.5 inch requirement. It uses a stepper motor stolen from an old Ender 3 Printer.

**Problem:** Not enough torque when at this low position. Cannot even lift 5 lbs. We want it to be able to lift like 20 (the compartment is 7lb alone, + friction, + storing things in the compartment will add weight).

  
**Feedback Requested:**

\- Should we scrap this mechanism and use a different method for pushing it up? Or just buy a more torque-y motor and make some slight adjustments to the mechanism to increase the mechanical advantage?

\- General UX/Appearance Feedback

\- What might you want to store in the secret compartment?

My Vertuo is making coffee with layers, but not in a good way. It’s an old school machine from I think 2018. They didn’t have as many models back then so I don’t know exactly which one this is. You either got a DeLonghi or a Breville. Mine is DeLonghi. 

This started (coincidentally?) when I got the new seasonal flavors - Almond Croissant and Peanut & Roasted Sesame. Some people were commenting how artificial it tastes, but I wasn’t tasting much of anything as it tasted watered down. 

So I descaled the machine using the Nespresso solution, followed instructions, and ran a rinse cycle. Now my coffee tastes like stale burnt coffee water at first. When I get to the bottom layer that appears darker in the picture, I can taste coffee but not good coffee. 

What’s interesting is now my flavored pods are stripped of their flavors. I thought I just got some bad sleeves of new flavors, but I tried other flavored pods from open sleeves and I taste nothing but acidic coffee water.

I wasn't shocked or blindsided by this information- he dumped me late winter of last year because he wasn't attracted to me anymore (his words). We looked to be able to remain cordial, maybe even perhaps get back together at some point but I wound up coming clean about a hook up I had 8 months after the break up and he said that I ruined his perception of me by doing that... So, he hates me now and that's fine. I deserve that.

Truthfully, I think I was looking for validation elsewhere because I couldn't find it in myself and I genuinely had no clue that he was ever intending to circle back. If I knew there was hope, I wouldn't have done it! I'd have waited on him like I did the last two times he dumped me. But no--when we talked, he seemed totally done with me. He said he didn't even love me anymore anyway so there was no use in trying to work it out. We remained living together and tried to just kind cohabitate and not step on each other's toes because he's a nice dude and knew I didn't have anywhere else to go. 

To make this very clear, I had no intention of dating or hooking up at first. But living together after the break up, for months, I was witnessing him suddenly leaving the house at 10/11pm and not returning to 2/3am. I foolishly sought the advice of others who said they were pretty much willing to bet their lives that he'd started sleeping around and after hearing it enough times, I believed them! And I finally decided to give someone a chance instead of turning everyone down because I was married... That wound up being my downfall. 

The hookup was meaningless. He was awful to me. Tbh, looking back, the whole interaction sorta played out like those stories of *'guys, dating a woman they hate because they dont want to be alone'* LMAO. It was a lesson for me to learn. I was an idiot but I opened my eyes and focused on me. Sorry- i'm rambling here.

Point is, hooking up with someone during the break up (regardless of my ex and I agreeing to hooking up outside) was the final nail in the coffin. My ex can't look at me anymore without feeling disgusted (his words). 

I have no friends that I can lean on in this hard time. They're either in relationships of their own and couldn't care less about my woes, or they're insisting that my ex was the asshole in the scenario. I don't want to shift blame. I fucked up. I own it. 

My family really only reaches out when they want money (that I don't have anymore.) .And aside from that: My mother smiled when i told her I was getting divorced and is all around just kinda weird about it. My dad says that I need to pull myself up by my bootstraps and move on because he's sure my ex has. And I guess he's right. 

I had a decent job but got fired because coming to work was too hard during my last bout of depression (I have a diagnosed mental illness) and missed too many days. It took like 4 months to finally get another job. Everything either fell apart at the last step or the company just ghosted me. Currently, I'm working scrubbing toilets for rich people and tbh I dont mind it. It's not as if I think I'm above a housekeeping job. After all, I have no reputable skills to speak of and no degree. It's just that I know that once this short contract is up at my exclassmates's place, I'll have to be on my own and take care of myself for the first time in 8 years and I CANNOT afford it. I work two weeks and my check comes out to be $500/$600 dollars. It'd take both checks just get pay rent at the shittiest apartment in my area- not even thinking about utilities and food. 

When I had a different job lined up, things were looking up! I thought I'd be able to take care of myself, work and even go to night school so I can work toward a new goal I had but, the company ghosted me. Trust me, I *am* trying. Since summer I've applied to no less than 200 jobs. On days off, it's pretty much all I do! Retail, food service, janitorial-- nothing is happening for me. 

I am losing hope. I've been suicidal all my life but I had it under control for a while but not anymore. I just keep thinking that at this rate, I'll have no choice but to be homeless/live in a women's shelter for as long as they'll have me. I imagine myself even broker than I am now, on the streets and strung out on something. And I just don't have it in me to wait on the inevitable to happen. 

I am trying my best to keep kicking. I've taken advice from anyone that will give it but things either get worse or don't change. I feel as if I am out of options now.",6,1731691293.0,Advice,18,0.8,False

Here are 4 ideas (but I'm open to completely different ones):

**1. AGI Timeline Prediction Market** (🎯 no real money, just bragging rights)

* Finally settle those ""AGI by 2030?"" debates with some skin in the game
* Watch your prediction accuracy score climb (or hilariously tank)
* Monthly milestone tracking to see who really knows their stuff
* Like fantasy football, but for the robot apocalypse

**2. AI Model Release Calendar**

* Never miss another GPT launch again
* Compare models without diving into 50 different Discord servers
* Clear ""what can it actually do?"" benchmarks
* Get pinged when something wild drops

**3. Research Paper Difficulty Rater**

* Browser extension that saves you from opening papers way above your pay grade
* Community ratings from ""ELI5"" to ""PhD Required""
* Shows what you need to know before diving in
* ""Time to comprehend"" estimates (coffee breaks vs weekend projects)

**4. AI Progress Newsletter + Extension**

* Track what you've actually read vs. saved for ""later"" (we all know how that goes)
* Weekly TL;DR of the important stuff
* Focus on real breakthroughs, not just PR
* Impact ratings from ""neat trick"" to ""call Elon""

Before I dive in and build one of these - has anyone seen something similar already? What would make these actually useful vs just another tool that collects dust?

P.S. Open to wildly different ideas or improvements too. Maybe we need something completely different to track our march towards AGI?",1,1731691210.0,ClaudeAI,0,0.67,False

I eat food that gives me a very bad migraine/vertigo (like red meat, yogurt, coffee, citrics, vanilla essence). That day I only have a migraine. The next two days I have a dizzy feeling when I stand up and it seems like my heart rate increases. After two days I'm completely fine again. 

Is this a symptom you have ever experienced? Is this something that could be associated with POTS or dysautonomia based on your experience?

Any experience or advice is welcome!

 When I got my Z8 last month, and also purchased a Delkin Card Reader + Delkin Black CFExpress Card, I was surprised at the heat coming off the Delkin’s aluminum case… even with no card inserted.  A quick online search showed not just Delkin’s reader, but it seemed to be a fairly universal problem across the board, with some saying they do not experience the issue.  But when I got a pop-up message on my PC’s Desktop that a “Power Surge USB / Excessive Power Draw” was occurring during its use, I was concerned. Spoke with the nice folks at Delkin and they confirmed the heat generated was “normal” ……. I decided to return the Delkin reader and card (came as a package) and try another brand.

I chose the Lexar RW250 with a Lexar Gold Pro 256GB CF Card… This time it went a bit better…. No further “Power Surge” Warnings… but the same generated Heat *with or without* the card inserted…. But I realized this was “normal” after reading the demands the CFExpress system requires.

So now I’m dealing with the Z8’s 47MP RAW files… and at times slow work times of Photoshop on my PC. Not too bad for a 7-year-old machine I overbuilt at the time with an Asus Gaming Motherboard and 16MB Memory with an i7 chipset. But De-Noise requires 7++ minutes and is just glacial.  I am not ready to replace the PC just yet, but thought maybe 32gb of memory might help things as the Resource Meter shows functions are being pressed against the 16gb already installed.

The first memory I purchased failed to Boot the machine… and it forced me to go through the Asus manual to insure I did not need to change any settings in BIOS. I’ve got the new Memory on order, but this is where it get interesting.

While going through the Manual, I only now see that this Board has two (2) rear USB-C Ports…One “A” and one “C” type… What? I have gone through this book many times prior and never realized these were there and available.  More likely that for me, Type C was never before on my Radar as a need. Till now.

What would happen if I hooked the Reader’s C Port directly to the Boards Type C Port, instead of the USB 3.0 Port? I was at least hoping for a small increase in Transfer Speed.

I loaded 275 RAW Photo’s onto the Card and started the transfer. There is a noticeable increase in Speed… Great…. And when I went to pull the card out, it was MUCH Cooler than ever before. And the Reader’s Body was also much cooler. Huh?  I did this twice again with the same cooler results. I then left the Reader hooked up with no card for 4+ hours… where before it would keep a coffee cup warm, it was now only slightly warm... but not hot. Same occurred with a Card inserted.

The only info I can find on this result is that Type C has higher Data transfer Rates, and Power Delivery capability, but nothing about what occurred for me. I only learned about Type C Power Delivery when I got the Z8 and powered it up from my Vehicles Jump Start Battery Pack and its “Type C” PD Port.

So, if you are connecting your Reader’s Type C Port into the common USB of your Computer and actually have a dedicated Type C Input, you may hopefully experience my same positive result.

Cheers!

After being introduced via a group chat, Kayla Hall and Kaitie Forbes became friends who often talked about starting a band for years. Eventually, still living in their home base of Nashville, Tennessee, the band that ended up with an earworm of a name, [Moody Joody](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0ndpuECxVStTsHhzq4Euxz?si=b81e5e7a123747cd), gained their third member, Andrew Pacheco, who also produces Moody Joody’s music.



***On the early days and “wanting attention”...***

*Kayla:* We started the band in 2020, just kind of on a whim. Andrew wasn’t originally in the band. We were honestly just bored during COVID and wanted attention. We gave Andrew a two week deadline to produce the song, it’s not even officially mastered, it’s just mixed at a level that you can release it and the rest is kind of history. That was the original song \[[*The Heat*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ghJnY7MDnBJYBQQJYs4MF?si=9efa0135e21c4b14)\] we put out and then Andrew joined shortly after that.

*Andrew:* It was always like the three of us just doing everything from the beginning. I think, at one point, you asked me if I wanted to join the band and I was like “no, that’s your thing.” The first song got some kind of attention and people were asking us where the rest of the music was. We didn’t have any.

*Kayla:* It got played in Finland. On Spotify, our demographics in Finland went crazy. I didn’t know how we got an editorial. We didn’t know anyone in the industry and didn’t know anyone at Spotify at the time. People started asking us what we were doing and to be honest, we didn’t explicitly have any other plans to have any other songs. The next probably four Moody Joody songs were ones we would write, record, release, and just go to the next one. There were no other songs in the vault.

*Andrew:* I officially joined after [*I Feel Everything*](https://open.spotify.com/track/7i5zYyJgr8FBnvVIvlyBCg?si=29007d6bc174492b) because I was so invested at that point. I asked \[Kayla and Kaitie\] if I could join and they said yes. We sat down at a coffee shop and we were like, “thank god!”

***On the origins of their catchy, memorable band name…***

Surprisingly, especially with how genius it is, Moody Joody was not the original band name Kayla and Kaitie were aiming to use. For a bit of context, they are signed to [Photo Finish Records](https://www.photofinishrecords.com/), and a now-labelmate of theirs is soft pop duo [joan](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3HXLY1sNXIxHfulrjPiRf5?si=55de9cf7f14f48c7).

*Kayla:* I still have the texts from the beginning. In 2018 or 2019, we were joking about the girl band being this angry thing, and my great aunt’s name was Joan, and she was a real bitch, so we were like, “yeah, bitchy grandma vibes,” because we just felt it was on brand. We were going to call ourselves Joanie. Then, we did a google search, and this other band, joan, comes along and is blowing up, so we’re like, “well, we can’t be Joanie, so gotta change the band name.”

*Kaitie:* We were gonna be The Yeehaw Girls.

*Andrew:* Which would’ve gone so well with “let’s ride”!

*Kayla:* I moved to Nashville to do country music, so part of it is that both Kaitie and I had done country before – writing and various things. We thought it’d be fun, so at that point, we came up with The Yeehaw Girls. It’s so unserious. Then we wondered if that would put us in a box where we had to write a certain genre, which we didn’t want. We wanted to be able to write whatever we wanted. That’s when Moody Joody was born.

*Popheads:* Is Judy someone else’s bitchy aunt?

*Kayla:* No, wait, it’s even better than that. If you look up Joody on Urban Dictionary, you might find a thing or two. Apparently, it means “juicy booty” and is also slang for a vagina. That really solidified it. We knew we had to look it up in case it meant something inappropriate, but that just solidified it for us.

*Kaitie:* \[laughing\] But, wait, it’s even better.

*Kayla:* At the very end of the definition, one of the quotes says something like “my joody itches, I hope I don’t have crabs like Katie!”



***On signing to Photo Finish, going on tour with joan and MisterWives, and settling into the next phase…***

*Andrew:* We’ve always wanted to make an album, which we will. At the time, because for the most part, we were doing one song at a time for so long to have stuff out, being able to intentionally create a body of work was hard, just based on how the band started and how up in the air everything was for a while. We were sort of forced into singles.

*Kayla:* We’re definitely gonna make an album. We love a project.

*Andrew:* We’ve been talking about this album for a long time. We’ve had the title, the theme.

***On dropping their EP, “Dream Girl”…***

This was a big week for Moody Joody. On November 8th, 2024, they released their first EP, composed of 6 songs that all feel like Moody Joody yet are still uniquely different and sonically mesh like a *dream*. Even when performing [*El Camino High*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2vcHGq62LLg2quONoXB32B?si=124cbd1256af420a) prior to its release while supporting MisterWives on their most recent tour, the band makes it perfectly clear how much they all love this song. It is the most recently written song to land on the EP and holds a lot of special energy for Kayla, Kaitie, and Andrew, so much so that Kaitie created choreography for their live performances of it.

*Kayla:* “[Dream Girl](https://open.spotify.com/album/0rmWZhNtY9IK37Fwfl5vXt?si=WVUHF95VQMWHE37Sbs45rQ)” just encompasses this musical world for us, but also the artists’ world. It’s very cinematic. All of our songs are very personal, too, so being able to write something that’s representative of what we’ve gone through, even in our love lives, is just really special. *El Camino High* is just a package deal of a song. The story goes so well with the production.

*Popheads:* “Dream Girl”’s title track has a bit of that infectious Nashville sound throughout it. Is that something we can anticipate to carry through future releases?

*Kayla:* For me, it felt more indie leaning than what I feel we’d done before. We’d done a lot more pop or indie-pop things, but this felt more indie leaning. Sonically, that felt so different than anything we’d done before. There are certain songs that feel like the next step is to lean into it more, so it felt like such a launchpad and it made so much sense that the EP would be titled “Dream Girl” after that.

*Kayla and Kaitie:* I feel like I categorize, and that all of our songs can be categorized either as “Moody” or “Joody” songs. [*Ground Control*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ZsAsw43qSWxcTeOephg36?si=22327656f7b84941) is a “Moody” song, but [*Velvet Connection*](https://open.spotify.com/track/2LR87o6yfUJzIKJsbgZeyB?si=1bc0ae6a37554f29) is a “Joody” song. You know?



***On Moody Joody’s influences…***

Despite their pop and indie releases, it may surprise you to learn that each member grew up with wildly differing taste in music and overall a completely different musical background. *El Camino High* features a spoken portion of the song which is an homage to Shania Twain’s iconic song *Still The One*, which is fitting once you learn that Kayla grew up on country radio.

*Kayla:* The first CD I ever owned was Rascal Flatts. I grew up in Missouri and country music made me want to be a songwriter. Then, my older sister introduced me to artists she was finding before they blew up. She found The 1975 and Vance Joy when she found them. Sonically, I don’t feel tied to country anymore, though.

*Kaitie:* When Kayla and I met, we discovered we both love Bleachers. I loved and still do listen to Arcade Fire, which was my favorite band. I also love The National, Band of Horses, and The Shins.

*Andrew:* Kaitie’s our indie girl! My favorite band growing up was the Counting Crows. Around my teenage years, I kind of fell more into emo like Dashboard Confessional and Jack’s Mannequin. Then, I segued into pop music with Tegan and Sara’s “Heartthrob” album. Something about it hit me in high school. Around that time, I fell into listening to Bleachers and The 1975, too, and now I listen to indie music much more. I don’t know. We’re all over the place.

***On the game of adding a feature to any of “Dream Girl”’s songs…***

*Popheads:* If you had to pick a song off of the EP to have a feature on, which would it be? You get one feature of your choice on any song.

*Kaitie:* I need to like, go meditate. Do we have Phosphorescent on *El Camino High*?

*Kayla:* I mean, he is a name drop. He can sing the chorus or maybe cover the song himself. That’s so tough, wow.

*Andrew:* I’d pick some sort of emo feature on *Pass The Time*. Dashboard Confessional on *Pass The Time* would be crazy. Yeah. That’s my answer.

We can expect a full length album in the future, guaranteed to be chock-full of songs recounting their personal experiences, especially within the divine feminine

1gs11we,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gs11we/10_fresh_productivity_tips_to_up_your_efficiency/,10 Fresh Productivity Tips to Up Your Efficiency Game,"Here’s a new set of productivity tips to help keep the momentum going. Whether you’re looking to mix up your routine or find a new edge, these tips are curated to add value to your day. Without further ado, here are 10 fresh productivity tips:

1) Focused First Hour: Spend the first hour of your workday on the most important task. It's amazing how much progress you can make with an undisturbed start.

2) The 50/10 Rule: Work for 50 minutes, then take a 10-minute break. This variation on the Pomodoro Technique gives you a longer stretch of focused time.

3) Zero-based Calendar: Schedule every hour of your day, even if it's for rest or leisure. This helps you make conscious choices about how you spend your time.

4) The Power of Visualization: Spend a few minutes each morning visualizing your day and the tasks you want to complete. A clear mental image can enhance focus and intention.

5) Email Sprints: Allocate specific times for checking and responding to emails. Outside of these times, keep your inbox closed.

6) The 'One-Touch' Rule: When you pick up an item (physical or digital), deal with it on the spot rather than putting it off.

7) Workstation Popcorn: Change your work environment throughout the day. Different settings can trigger different modes of thinking and energy.

8) AI-Powered Prioritization: Use an app with AI assistance, like beedone, to help you identify and focus on the tasks that will make the biggest impact.

9) The 5-Second Rule: If you're hesitating to start a task, count down from 5 and then just begin. It's a simple trick to beat analysis paralysis.

10) Reward Banking: Set up a system where you earn 'credits' for completing tasks, which you can then 'cash in' for rewards like a coffee treat or a movie night.

Feel free to experiment with these tips and see which ones resonate with your workflow. Productivity is a personal journey, and sometimes the most subtle changes can lead to the greatest gains.

1gs0yya,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tilldrive/comments/1gs0yya/bmw_m4_the_beast_in_a_fancy_suit/,BMW M4: The Beast in a Fancy Suit ,"The BMW M4 is what happens when a luxury coupe decides it wants to hit the gym, bulk up, and still show up to dinner in a tuxedo. Equal parts muscle and charm, it’s the car that says, “I’m here to win races and take selfies, and I’m all out of storage space for selfies.”

Performance That’ll Scare Your Passengers

Pop the hood, and you’ll find a 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six engine with enough horsepower (503 in the Competition trim) to make your mother-in-law reconsider ever asking for a ride again. It’s fast—like “oops, I missed my exit” fast, with a 0-60 mph time of just 3.8 seconds.

You can pick between a 6-speed manual (for people who like to live dangerously) or an 8-speed automatic (for people who enjoy having one hand free for coffee). Either way, the M4's adaptive suspension and razor-sharp handling make cornering so much fun, you might take the long way everywhere.

Looks That Turn Heads (and Start Debates)

Let’s talk about that grille. The kidney grille on the M4 is like pineapple on pizza—you either love it or you’re wrong. But one thing’s for sure: people will notice you. Pair that bold design with sharp LED headlights and a sleek, aerodynamic shape, and you’ve got a car that screams “look at me” without needing a spoiler the size of a park bench.

On the inside, it’s all luxury. Think Merino leather seats that hug you tighter than your favorite pair of jeans and a 14.9-inch touchscreen so advanced it probably knows more about your Spotify habits than you do.

Tech That’s Smarter Than You

The BMW M4 doesn’t just go fast; it goes smart. Features like:

M Drift Analyzer: A feature that basically rates how cool your skids are. (Yes, really.)

Safety Tech: Lane-keeping assist and emergency braking, because even daredevils need to stay safe.

Voice Control: Talk to your car, and it actually listens—unlike your friends who’ve heard enough about your dream road trip.


For the Road and the Track (or Just a Parking Lot Meetup)

The M4 isn’t just built for the road; it’s also track-ready. But let’s be real—most of us will use it to show off in parking lots or flex at stoplights. Still, knowing you could take it to the track is enough to justify buying those M Carbon bucket seats and pretending you’re the next F1 champ.

Conclusion

The BMW M4 is like that friend who’s ridiculously talented, annoyingly good-looking, and still somehow likable. It’s fast, fun, and just flashy enough to make your neighbors jealous. Whether you’re tearing up the track or rolling up to brunch, the M4 makes sure all eyes are on you—and honestly, isn’t that the point?

My name is Maria, i am a college student from Colorado, i had planned a road trip with my friend Jess, this is what happened on that road trip…

The road trip had been my idea. Jess had just come out of a messy breakup, and I was drowning in assignments. We needed a break—something far enough from campus to feel like an escape. So, a three-day drive through the mountains, with plans to stay at a friend’s cabin by the coast, sounded perfect. I had everything planned down to the playlists and coffee stops. We left campus at dawn, the sun barely peeking over the horizon as we drove out of town.

The first few hours were bliss. We laughed about the lousy food on campus, ranted about professors who loved to pile on work, and blasted music from our high school days. The air was fresh, the sky a clear, sharp blue, and we had no clue what was coming. Looking back, I almost envy how naive we were then.

As the afternoon dragged on, the landscape around us grew more remote. The trees became denser, towering and twisted, leaning over the road like they were trying to close in around us. Jess had dozed off in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the window, her breathing soft and even. I was getting a little sleepy myself, lulled by the rhythmic sound of tires against pavement. But then I noticed something strange.

Ahead, just off the side of the road, a figure stood motionless by the trees. As we drew closer, I realized it was an old woman. She wore a long, faded dress and a tattered scarf wrapped tightly around her head, hiding most of her face. Her posture was unnaturally stiff, her arms hanging limply at her sides as she stood perfectly still, her eyes fixed on the road.

Something about her felt… wrong. My instincts prickled, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just the sight of someone in such an isolated area, but a weird feeling had settled in my stomach.

We drove past her slowly, and I couldn’t help but glance back in the rearview mirror. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned her head—just stayed there, watching us disappear down the road.

I didn’t wake Jess. I kept driving, brushing off the encounter as some eerie coincidence. Maybe she was a local, waiting for someone, or just… lost. But as the minutes passed, I couldn’t shake the image of her still figure, standing so perfectly still, as though she’d been carved out of stone.

The road stretched on, winding through a seemingly endless forest. The trees grew closer together, casting heavy shadows across the pavement. It felt like we’d been driving for hours, but when I checked the GPS, our location barely seemed to have changed. The blue dot was creeping along at a snail’s pace, and our arrival time was now an hour later than I’d estimated. I checked the clock, frowning. Had we been driving that slowly?

Jess finally stirred beside me, stretching and blinking herself awake. She looked out the window, squinting at the dense forest around us.

""Are we almost there?"" she asked, stifling a yawn.

""Not quite,"" I said, trying to keep my voice casual. ""We’re making slower progress than I thought.""

She shrugged, turning to gaze out the window, but a look of unease settled on her face as she took in the unfamiliar landscape. The mood in the car shifted, the easygoing vibe from earlier replaced with something tense and uneasy. We sat in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the low buzz of static from the radio.

That’s when I saw her again.

I almost missed her, half-hidden by a cluster of trees just ahead. But there she was, the same old woman, standing by the roadside in that faded dress and scarf. Her posture was identical, her arms at her sides, her eyes locked on us. My heart pounded as we drove past, and this time Jess saw her too.

“Whoa… Did you see her?” Jess asked, her voice low and wary. “Isn’t that… the same woman?”

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah. I thought it was just me.”

Jess leaned back, chewing her lip. “How would she get here? There’s no town for miles.”

I didn’t have an answer, and I didn’t want to speculate. The uneasy feeling in my gut had turned into something heavier, a creeping dread that I couldn’t ignore. But as unsettling as it was, I tried to tell myself that there was some reasonable explanation. Maybe she had a car parked nearby, or a house hidden in the woods. Maybe we were just imagining things.

But as we drove on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that somehow, her gaze had followed us long after we’d passed her by.

Night began to fall, the trees casting long, dark shadows across the road. The headlights seemed to barely pierce the thickening darkness, and the silence around us grew almost oppressive. I tried turning on the radio, but only static crackled through the speakers. Even my phone had no signal, the bars stubbornly refusing to budge.

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension thickening with every passing mile. Finally, Jess spoke up, her voice barely more than a whisper.

""Do you… feel like we’re being followed?""

I glanced at her, and for a moment, I considered laughing it off. But the fear in her eyes mirrored my own, and I couldn’t deny it any longer.

""Yeah,"" I admitted, my voice barely steady. ""I feel it too.""

We kept driving, the silence between us stretching taut, both of us too scared to say anything more. As night fully fell, we passed no other cars, no houses, no signs of life—just an unbroken wall of trees pressing in on either side. The road felt endless, stretching out in front of us like it went on forever, leading us deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, after what felt like hours, a dim light appeared in the distance—a small, flickering neon sign on the roof of a rundown motel. Relief flooded through me as I pulled into the gravel lot, the headlights illuminating the faded, peeling paint and grimy windows.

Jess and I hurried inside, booking a room without a second glance at the front desk. The clerk, a wiry man with sunken eyes, barely looked up as he handed us the keys, his gaze fixed somewhere behind us, as though he’d seen something lurking just beyond the glass doors.

The room was sparse and cold, the walls yellowed and cracked. Jess locked the door behind us, checking the window to make sure it was secure. Neither of us spoke about what we’d seen on the road, but the tension was palpable, a silent understanding that we’d experienced something we couldn’t explain.

As I lay in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, I couldn’t shake the image of her—the old woman, standing by the roadside, watching us with that blank, empty stare. I felt her presence lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow that wouldn’t fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, obscured by the scarf, her gaze piercing through the darkness.

Hours passed, but sleep wouldn’t come. And in the silence of that tiny, dilapidated motel room, I could have sworn I heard footsteps outside the door. Slow, shuffling steps, moving back and forth, as though someone was pacing, waiting for something—or someone.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look. I lay frozen in bed, listening to the quiet, steady footsteps until they faded into the night, leaving me lying there, wide-eyed and trembling, waiting for dawn to come.

I woke up early, my body stiff and tense. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as sunlight crept through the thin, yellowed curtains of our motel room. I sat up, trying to push away the fog of sleeplessness and to brush off the memory of that woman standing by the road. But when I looked over at Jess, her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from a restless night, and I knew she’d felt it too.

We packed up in silence, trying to shake off the strange heaviness that lingered from the day before. After a quick stop for coffee, we got back on the road, hoping that a few hours of clear driving would lift the tension that seemed to follow us. But when Jess plugged in the GPS, a chill went down my spine. The screen blinked a few times, showing the same route from yesterday.

""Are you sure that’s the right way?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Jess frowned, tapping at the screen.

""Yeah… I mean, I think so,"" she said, glancing at the map. ""It’s weird, though. It’s like the same road… even though I swear I picked a different route today.""

I laughed nervously. “Maybe it’s just a bad signal.”

She nodded, but her eyes didn’t leave the screen. I could tell she was just as uneasy as I was. Finally, she shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Whatever. Let’s just get going.”

We pulled out of the motel lot and started driving, the road stretching out in front of us in a long, unbroken line. The forest seemed darker than yesterday, the trees pressing in on either side of us, their twisted branches reaching across the road like bony fingers. Shadows pooled under the thick canopy, and every now and then, I’d catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of my vision—just a flicker, gone before I could turn my head to see it clearly.

After an hour or so, Jess turned to me, her face pale. “Is it just me, or does it feel like… like we’re not getting anywhere?”

I checked the clock, frowning. We’d been driving for well over an hour, but the GPS showed only a few miles of progress. I double-checked the fuel gauge. We had plenty of gas, and there was no reason we should be moving this slowly.

“It’s like… the road’s stretching out,” I murmured, trying to make sense of it. But my words hung in the air, unanswered, because how do you explain something like that?

The radio crackled with static, and I turned it off, unwilling to break the tense silence that had settled between us. We drove on, mile after mile, the road twisting through the endless forest like a coiled snake. The sun had barely moved in the sky, stuck in that eerie, pre-noon brightness, casting long shadows that seemed to follow us.

And then we saw her again.

The old woman stood by the side of the road, in the exact same spot as yesterday. She was dressed the same way, her faded dress and frayed scarf stirring in the faint breeze. This time, though, her posture was different—more alert, more… attentive. She stood with one hand raised, palm out, as though signaling us to stop.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt Jess’s hand grip my arm, her fingers cold and tight. “No… No way,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How is she here? She can’t… she can’t be here.”

I forced myself to keep driving, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the rearview mirror. The woman’s face was still obscured by the scarf, but I could feel her eyes on us, following us even as we passed her by. The skin on the back of my neck prickled, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as we left her behind.

Neither of us spoke for a long time after that. Jess sat with her knees drawn up, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as though trying to ward off a chill. I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to look back, afraid of what I might see.

After another hour of silent driving, the road finally seemed to open up a bit. I felt a strange sense of relief, like we’d escaped something that had been closing in on us. We hadn’t seen any signs of life—not a single car, house, or gas station—since leaving the motel, but finally, a small, weathered sign appeared on the side of the road: “Gas, 10 miles.”

I sped up, eager to reach some sign of civilization, even if it was just a rundown gas station in the middle of nowhere.

When we finally reached it, I pulled in, the tires crunching on the gravel as I parked by one of the ancient-looking pumps. The place was eerily quiet, and a sense of unease washed over me as I climbed out of the car. I glanced around, but the station seemed deserted. The windows were covered in grime, and the only sound was the faint, shivering wind rustling through the trees.

Jess stayed in the car, staring at the dashboard as though afraid to look up. I could feel her anxiety from where I stood, but I didn’t blame her. I was barely keeping it together myself.

As I filled the tank, a figure appeared in the doorway of the gas station. I jumped, almost spilling gas on the ground. It was a man, his face obscured by the shadow of his hat, his clothes worn and stained. He watched me for a moment, then stepped out onto the porch, his movements slow and deliberate.

“Headed somewhere?” he asked, his voice rough and low, barely audible over the wind.

I nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah… just passing through.”

He tilted his head, his eyes narrowing slightly as he looked me over. “Be careful out there. Roads don’t always lead where you think they do.”

I felt a chill at his words, but I didn’t know how to respond. He watched me in silence for a moment, then turned and disappeared back into the shadows of the gas station. I hurried back to the car, my heart pounding as I slid into the driver’s seat.

Jess looked at me, her eyes wide. “Did he… did he say anything to you?”

I shook my head, lying without really knowing why. “Nothing important. Let’s just go.”

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension between us thick and oppressive. The road stretched out in front of us, twisting and turning through the endless forest. Every mile felt like a lifetime, and the shadows around us grew darker, thicker, as though something was closing in.

I don’t know how long we drove—time felt meaningless, slipping away in the endless monotony of the road. But as evening began to fall, the light fading into a murky twilight, I saw something ahead that made my heart stop.

The old woman.

She was standing in the same spot as before, her back straight, her gaze fixed on us. Her hand was raised again, palm out, as though warning us to stop. This time, though, her face was turned directly toward us, and I could finally see her eyes.

They were pale and empty, like glass, staring into me with a cold intensity that made my blood run cold. I looked away, unable to hold her gaze, and kept driving, my hands shaking on the wheel.

As we passed her, Jess grabbed my arm, her voice tight with fear. “Stop. Just stop the car.”

I didn’t want to, every instinct telling me to keep going, to leave her behind and never look back. But something in Jess’s voice—the sheer terror—made me pull over to the side of the road, my hands white-knuckling the wheel as I forced myself to breathe.

We sat there in silence, neither of us moving, both of us staring straight ahead, too afraid to look back. The air was thick, suffocating, as though the forest around us was closing in.

Finally, Jess broke the silence, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What… what does she want from us?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that we were trapped on this road, caught in some nightmare that refused to end. The woman was a constant, a silent watcher, appearing at every turn, always waiting, always watching.

As darkness fell, the shadows grew deeper, swallowing the road and everything around us. I started the car again, my hands shaking, and drove on, the headlights barely piercing the darkness.

But as we left her behind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still there, her empty eyes fixed on us, following us into the night.

 

I woke up feeling more drained than I had on any morning before. The room was dim, the curtains drawn tight against a sun that barely seemed to rise, casting only a weak, grayish light through the cracks. Jess was still asleep, her face tense even in slumber, and for a brief moment, I considered not waking her at all. Maybe she’d be better off staying in bed, far from whatever waited for us on the road.

But as much as I wanted to believe we could simply turn back, a sick, crawling feeling told me that no matter which direction we drove, we would end up on the same road—stuck in some terrible loop that we hadn’t meant to enter.

With a heavy heart, I roused Jess, and we packed up in silence. She avoided my gaze, her lips pressed into a thin, tight line. It felt like we were going to our own funeral.

After a quick, silent breakfast, we loaded up the car and set out. The world outside seemed grayer, the trees bare and twisted, as though drained of life. I felt a cold dread seep into my bones as we pulled back onto the road. The GPS flickered, blinking uncertainly for a moment before settling back onto the same route—the road that had held us captive for two days. I barely felt surprised; I knew by now there was no escape.

Jess sat beside me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Neither of us spoke as we drove through the thickening mist, the forest around us looming like a dark, shadowy tunnel, closing in on us as we went.

Hours passed, but the landscape never changed. The trees all looked the same, stretching endlessly on either side, their branches twisted and gnarled. The silence in the car was deafening, pressing in on us, as though the very air had thickened. Every now and then, I’d catch a movement out of the corner of my eye, a flicker in the trees that vanished as soon as I turned my head.

And then, around midday, we saw her again.

The old woman was standing by the roadside, her figure barely visible through the thick fog that had settled over the road. She wore the same faded dress, the same frayed scarf, but something about her was different. Her posture was more rigid, her head tilted slightly to one side, as though she were waiting for us.

I felt Jess’s grip on my arm tighten, her nails digging into my skin. “Don’t stop,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Just keep driving. Please.”

But as we drew closer, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop. It was like some invisible force was tugging at me, urging me to pull over, to get out of the car and walk toward her. My foot hovered over the brake, my hands tightening on the wheel as I struggled to resist.

“She’s just… there,” I said, more to myself than to Jess, my voice hollow. “She’s just… waiting.”

The woman raised her hand, her pale, bony fingers outstretched, beckoning us forward. Her eyes, cold and empty, fixed on me with a piercing intensity that made my skin crawl.

Jess’s voice shook. “Just go, please… don’t look at her. Just go.”

I forced myself to keep driving, my eyes locked on the road ahead, refusing to look back. I could feel her gaze on us, though—burning into the back of my head as we passed her by. It was like a weight, pressing down on me, growing heavier and heavier until I could barely breathe.

Minutes stretched into hours, and still, we drove. The road seemed endless, a looping, unchanging nightmare that refused to release us. The forest grew darker, the fog thickening until I could barely see a few feet in front of us. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners of my vision, and every time I glanced at the GPS, it showed the same unchanging coordinates.

Jess was silent, her face pale, her eyes glazed over with fear. I felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching everything from a distance, my mind slipping further and further away from reality.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to set, the car began to sputter.

I looked down, panic rising in my chest as the fuel gauge dipped suddenly, the needle plunging toward empty. My foot pressed harder on the gas, but the engine choked and sputtered, slowing down until the car rolled to a stop.

“No,” I whispered, my heart pounding. “This can’t be happening. We just filled up this morning. We can’t be out of gas.”

But the car was dead, the engine silent and unresponsive. I looked at Jess, panic clawing at my chest. She was staring out the window, her face frozen in terror.

“She’s here,” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “She’s coming.”

I looked up, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

The old woman was standing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away, her figure barely visible through the fog. Her hand was raised, beckoning us forward, her eyes fixed on me with an unblinking stare.

I felt a chill seep into my bones, freezing me in place. I wanted to move, to get out of the car and run, but I couldn’t. It was like I was rooted to the spot, trapped by her gaze.

Jess grabbed my arm, her voice shaking. “Don’t go… please, don’t go.”

But something inside me was pulling me forward, an irresistible force that I couldn’t ignore. I opened the car door, stepping out into the cold, damp air. The fog clung to my skin, thick and suffocating, as I took a step toward her.

The woman turned and began to walk into the trees, her figure disappearing into the mist. Without thinking, I followed, my legs moving of their own accord, my mind a hazy blur. Jess’s voice faded behind me, her pleas lost in the fog as I followed the woman into the darkness.

She led me deeper into the forest, her footsteps silent on the moss-covered ground. The trees closed in around us, their twisted branches reaching down like skeletal hands, brushing against my skin as I walked. I could hear whispers in the shadows, faint voices murmuring just out of reach, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

Finally, we emerged into a small clearing, and I stopped, my breath catching in my throat.

There was a house in the middle of the clearing, a dilapidated, crumbling structure that looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The windows were shattered, the walls covered in moss and ivy, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. But the woman walked up to the door, turning to look at me with that same, unblinking stare.

“Come inside,” she said, her voice a raspy whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to run, to turn back and find Jess. But something held me in place, a strange, overpowering compulsion that I couldn’t resist. I took a step forward, then another, until I was standing on the threshold, staring into the dark, empty interior.

The woman gestured for me to enter, her face obscured in the shadows. I took a deep breath, stepping over the threshold and into the darkness.

Inside, the air was thick and stale, the walls covered in dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked beneath my feet, and I could barely see anything in the dim light. I turned to look at the woman, but she was gone, vanished into the shadows.

A cold dread settled over me as I realized I was alone.

I tried to back out, but the door had disappeared, the walls around me shifting and warping until I couldn’t tell where I’d entered. Panic surged in my chest, and I stumbled through the dark, my hands brushing against cold, damp walls that seemed to close in around me.

And then I heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the darkness. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as the footsteps grew closer, closer, until they were right behind me.

I turned, my breath hitching as I saw her standing in the shadows, her empty eyes fixed on me, her face twisted into a cold, cruel smile.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty house. “You don’t belong here.”

The world around me began to blur, the walls twisting and melting until I was surrounded by darkness. The last thing I saw was her face, looming over me, her eyes cold and empty, pulling me into the shadows.

And then, everything went black.

The first thing I felt was the warmth of sunlight filtering through my window. My eyes fluttered open, and for a few seconds, I just lay there, staring at the familiar ceiling of my bedroom. The events of the last few days felt like a distant, feverish memory, and a thick fog of confusion settled over me as I tried to piece together what had happened.

Had it all been… a dream?

I sat up slowly, the edges of my mind still hazy, haunted by images of twisted trees, the endless road, and the woman’s piercing, empty gaze. My heart pounded as I remembered her whisper: *“You don’t belong here.”* My breath caught, and I reached up, feeling the sweat beaded on my forehead, my skin cold to the touch.

Looking around, everything seemed normal—my clothes piled on the chair, my bag tossed on the floor, my phone on the nightstand. The digital clock blinked 8:12 AM in neon green. Nothing felt out of place. And yet, a strange heaviness lingered, a weight pressing down on my chest, like the dream hadn’t fully let go of me.

I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. The idea of calling Jess popped into my mind, but something about it filled me with a sense of dread. What if she’d had the same dream? What if the whole thing was some twisted premonition, a warning?

Before I could talk myself out of it, I picked up my phone and called her. After a few rings, Jess answered, her voice groggy but familiar.

“Hello?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

“Jess, it’s me,” I said, my voice sounding strange in my own ears. “Did… did you sleep okay?”

There was a pause on the other end, and I could almost feel her hesitation. “Yeah… I mean, not really,” she admitted. “I had this… this nightmare. It was so real, like I was actually there.”

My heart skipped a beat. “What… what happened in the nightmare?”

Jess took a shaky breath. “We were on this road trip. And we kept seeing this old woman by the road… over and over again. No matter how far we drove, we couldn’t get away from her. And then, on the last day, she invited us inside her house, and…” Her voice trailed off, trembling. “And it was like we were trapped, like we’d never get out.”

My stomach twisted, and I felt a surge of cold dread. “Jess, I… I had the same dream. Exactly the same.”

The silence on the other end of the line felt heavy, weighted with unspoken fear. “This can’t just be a coincidence, can it?” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “It felt so real, like it was some kind of… warning.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Maybe… maybe it was. I don’t know, Jess. But we were supposed to go on that trip today.”

“No way.” Jess’s voice was suddenly firm, edged with panic. “I’m not going. Not after that. There’s something wrong about this, something… dangerous.”

A chill ran down my spine. Part of me wanted to believe it had all just been a strange, shared nightmare, some bizarre trick of our minds. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was more than that, that we’d somehow glimpsed a dark future that had been waiting for us.

I glanced at my packed bags, my heart pounding. It felt like they didn’t belong in my room anymore, like they were somehow tainted by the nightmare. I shivered, looking away, not wanting to touch them.

“I think you’re right,” I said, my voice unsteady. “Maybe… maybe we’re not supposed to go on this trip.”

We sat in silence for a moment, both of us caught in the same silent understanding. The dream had felt like a warning, and neither of us wanted to find out what might happen if we ignored it. The road was calling to us, but it was a call we’d both decided not to answer.

Finally, Jess spoke, her voice low and filled with relief. “Thank you. I don’t think I could go after that… even if I wanted to.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah… me neither.”

We said our goodbyes and hung up, and I let the phone fall from my hand, my fingers numb. The room felt quiet, almost too quiet, and I shivered, feeling that same, lingering unease creeping over me. Even though I was awake, it felt like the dream hadn’t fully let go, like some part of it was still lurking in the corners of my mind, waiting.

And as I lay back down, staring at the ceiling, I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere out there, the woman was waiting, her cold, empty eyes fixed on the road, watching for us.

My name is Maria, i am a college student from Colorado, i had planned a road trip with my friend Jess, this is what happened on that road trip…

The road trip had been my idea. Jess had just come out of a messy breakup, and I was drowning in assignments. We needed a break—something far enough from campus to feel like an escape. So, a three-day drive through the mountains, with plans to stay at a friend’s cabin by the coast, sounded perfect. I had everything planned down to the playlists and coffee stops. We left campus at dawn, the sun barely peeking over the horizon as we drove out of town.

The first few hours were bliss. We laughed about the lousy food on campus, ranted about professors who loved to pile on work, and blasted music from our high school days. The air was fresh, the sky a clear, sharp blue, and we had no clue what was coming. Looking back, I almost envy how naive we were then.

As the afternoon dragged on, the landscape around us grew more remote. The trees became denser, towering and twisted, leaning over the road like they were trying to close in around us. Jess had dozed off in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the window, her breathing soft and even. I was getting a little sleepy myself, lulled by the rhythmic sound of tires against pavement. But then I noticed something strange.

Ahead, just off the side of the road, a figure stood motionless by the trees. As we drew closer, I realized it was an old woman. She wore a long, faded dress and a tattered scarf wrapped tightly around her head, hiding most of her face. Her posture was unnaturally stiff, her arms hanging limply at her sides as she stood perfectly still, her eyes fixed on the road.

Something about her felt… wrong. My instincts prickled, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just the sight of someone in such an isolated area, but a weird feeling had settled in my stomach.

We drove past her slowly, and I couldn’t help but glance back in the rearview mirror. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned her head—just stayed there, watching us disappear down the road.

I didn’t wake Jess. I kept driving, brushing off the encounter as some eerie coincidence. Maybe she was a local, waiting for someone, or just… lost. But as the minutes passed, I couldn’t shake the image of her still figure, standing so perfectly still, as though she’d been carved out of stone.

The road stretched on, winding through a seemingly endless forest. The trees grew closer together, casting heavy shadows across the pavement. It felt like we’d been driving for hours, but when I checked the GPS, our location barely seemed to have changed. The blue dot was creeping along at a snail’s pace, and our arrival time was now an hour later than I’d estimated. I checked the clock, frowning. Had we been driving that slowly?

Jess finally stirred beside me, stretching and blinking herself awake. She looked out the window, squinting at the dense forest around us.

""Are we almost there?"" she asked, stifling a yawn.

""Not quite,"" I said, trying to keep my voice casual. ""We’re making slower progress than I thought.""

She shrugged, turning to gaze out the window, but a look of unease settled on her face as she took in the unfamiliar landscape. The mood in the car shifted, the easygoing vibe from earlier replaced with something tense and uneasy. We sat in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the low buzz of static from the radio.

That’s when I saw her again.

I almost missed her, half-hidden by a cluster of trees just ahead. But there she was, the same old woman, standing by the roadside in that faded dress and scarf. Her posture was identical, her arms at her sides, her eyes locked on us. My heart pounded as we drove past, and this time Jess saw her too.

“Whoa… Did you see her?” Jess asked, her voice low and wary. “Isn’t that… the same woman?”

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah. I thought it was just me.”

Jess leaned back, chewing her lip. “How would she get here? There’s no town for miles.”

I didn’t have an answer, and I didn’t want to speculate. The uneasy feeling in my gut had turned into something heavier, a creeping dread that I couldn’t ignore. But as unsettling as it was, I tried to tell myself that there was some reasonable explanation. Maybe she had a car parked nearby, or a house hidden in the woods. Maybe we were just imagining things.

But as we drove on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that somehow, her gaze had followed us long after we’d passed her by.

Night began to fall, the trees casting long, dark shadows across the road. The headlights seemed to barely pierce the thickening darkness, and the silence around us grew almost oppressive. I tried turning on the radio, but only static crackled through the speakers. Even my phone had no signal, the bars stubbornly refusing to budge.

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension thickening with every passing mile. Finally, Jess spoke up, her voice barely more than a whisper.

""Do you… feel like we’re being followed?""

I glanced at her, and for a moment, I considered laughing it off. But the fear in her eyes mirrored my own, and I couldn’t deny it any longer.

""Yeah,"" I admitted, my voice barely steady. ""I feel it too.""

We kept driving, the silence between us stretching taut, both of us too scared to say anything more. As night fully fell, we passed no other cars, no houses, no signs of life—just an unbroken wall of trees pressing in on either side. The road felt endless, stretching out in front of us like it went on forever, leading us deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, after what felt like hours, a dim light appeared in the distance—a small, flickering neon sign on the roof of a rundown motel. Relief flooded through me as I pulled into the gravel lot, the headlights illuminating the faded, peeling paint and grimy windows.

Jess and I hurried inside, booking a room without a second glance at the front desk. The clerk, a wiry man with sunken eyes, barely looked up as he handed us the keys, his gaze fixed somewhere behind us, as though he’d seen something lurking just beyond the glass doors.

The room was sparse and cold, the walls yellowed and cracked. Jess locked the door behind us, checking the window to make sure it was secure. Neither of us spoke about what we’d seen on the road, but the tension was palpable, a silent understanding that we’d experienced something we couldn’t explain.

As I lay in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, I couldn’t shake the image of her—the old woman, standing by the roadside, watching us with that blank, empty stare. I felt her presence lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow that wouldn’t fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, obscured by the scarf, her gaze piercing through the darkness.

Hours passed, but sleep wouldn’t come. And in the silence of that tiny, dilapidated motel room, I could have sworn I heard footsteps outside the door. Slow, shuffling steps, moving back and forth, as though someone was pacing, waiting for something—or someone.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look. I lay frozen in bed, listening to the quiet, steady footsteps until they faded into the night, leaving me lying there, wide-eyed and trembling, waiting for dawn to come.

I woke up early, my body stiff and tense. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as sunlight crept through the thin, yellowed curtains of our motel room. I sat up, trying to push away the fog of sleeplessness and to brush off the memory of that woman standing by the road. But when I looked over at Jess, her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from a restless night, and I knew she’d felt it too.

We packed up in silence, trying to shake off the strange heaviness that lingered from the day before. After a quick stop for coffee, we got back on the road, hoping that a few hours of clear driving would lift the tension that seemed to follow us. But when Jess plugged in the GPS, a chill went down my spine. The screen blinked a few times, showing the same route from yesterday.

""Are you sure that’s the right way?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Jess frowned, tapping at the screen.

""Yeah… I mean, I think so,"" she said, glancing at the map. ""It’s weird, though. It’s like the same road… even though I swear I picked a different route today.""

I laughed nervously. “Maybe it’s just a bad signal.”

She nodded, but her eyes didn’t leave the screen. I could tell she was just as uneasy as I was. Finally, she shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Whatever. Let’s just get going.”

We pulled out of the motel lot and started driving, the road stretching out in front of us in a long, unbroken line. The forest seemed darker than yesterday, the trees pressing in on either side of us, their twisted branches reaching across the road like bony fingers. Shadows pooled under the thick canopy, and every now and then, I’d catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of my vision—just a flicker, gone before I could turn my head to see it clearly.

After an hour or so, Jess turned to me, her face pale. “Is it just me, or does it feel like… like we’re not getting anywhere?”

I checked the clock, frowning. We’d been driving for well over an hour, but the GPS showed only a few miles of progress. I double-checked the fuel gauge. We had plenty of gas, and there was no reason we should be moving this slowly.

“It’s like… the road’s stretching out,” I murmured, trying to make sense of it. But my words hung in the air, unanswered, because how do you explain something like that?

The radio crackled with static, and I turned it off, unwilling to break the tense silence that had settled between us. We drove on, mile after mile, the road twisting through the endless forest like a coiled snake. The sun had barely moved in the sky, stuck in that eerie, pre-noon brightness, casting long shadows that seemed to follow us.

And then we saw her again.

The old woman stood by the side of the road, in the exact same spot as yesterday. She was dressed the same way, her faded dress and frayed scarf stirring in the faint breeze. This time, though, her posture was different—more alert, more… attentive. She stood with one hand raised, palm out, as though signaling us to stop.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt Jess’s hand grip my arm, her fingers cold and tight. “No… No way,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How is she here? She can’t… she can’t be here.”

I forced myself to keep driving, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the rearview mirror. The woman’s face was still obscured by the scarf, but I could feel her eyes on us, following us even as we passed her by. The skin on the back of my neck prickled, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as we left her behind.

Neither of us spoke for a long time after that. Jess sat with her knees drawn up, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as though trying to ward off a chill. I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to look back, afraid of what I might see.

After another hour of silent driving, the road finally seemed to open up a bit. I felt a strange sense of relief, like we’d escaped something that had been closing in on us. We hadn’t seen any signs of life—not a single car, house, or gas station—since leaving the motel, but finally, a small, weathered sign appeared on the side of the road: “Gas, 10 miles.”

I sped up, eager to reach some sign of civilization, even if it was just a rundown gas station in the middle of nowhere.

When we finally reached it, I pulled in, the tires crunching on the gravel as I parked by one of the ancient-looking pumps. The place was eerily quiet, and a sense of unease washed over me as I climbed out of the car. I glanced around, but the station seemed deserted. The windows were covered in grime, and the only sound was the faint, shivering wind rustling through the trees.

Jess stayed in the car, staring at the dashboard as though afraid to look up. I could feel her anxiety from where I stood, but I didn’t blame her. I was barely keeping it together myself.

As I filled the tank, a figure appeared in the doorway of the gas station. I jumped, almost spilling gas on the ground. It was a man, his face obscured by the shadow of his hat, his clothes worn and stained. He watched me for a moment, then stepped out onto the porch, his movements slow and deliberate.

“Headed somewhere?” he asked, his voice rough and low, barely audible over the wind.

I nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah… just passing through.”

He tilted his head, his eyes narrowing slightly as he looked me over. “Be careful out there. Roads don’t always lead where you think they do.”

I felt a chill at his words, but I didn’t know how to respond. He watched me in silence for a moment, then turned and disappeared back into the shadows of the gas station. I hurried back to the car, my heart pounding as I slid into the driver’s seat.

Jess looked at me, her eyes wide. “Did he… did he say anything to you?”

I shook my head, lying without really knowing why. “Nothing important. Let’s just go.”

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension between us thick and oppressive. The road stretched out in front of us, twisting and turning through the endless forest. Every mile felt like a lifetime, and the shadows around us grew darker, thicker, as though something was closing in.

I don’t know how long we drove—time felt meaningless, slipping away in the endless monotony of the road. But as evening began to fall, the light fading into a murky twilight, I saw something ahead that made my heart stop.

The old woman.

She was standing in the same spot as before, her back straight, her gaze fixed on us. Her hand was raised again, palm out, as though warning us to stop. This time, though, her face was turned directly toward us, and I could finally see her eyes.

They were pale and empty, like glass, staring into me with a cold intensity that made my blood run cold. I looked away, unable to hold her gaze, and kept driving, my hands shaking on the wheel.

As we passed her, Jess grabbed my arm, her voice tight with fear. “Stop. Just stop the car.”

I didn’t want to, every instinct telling me to keep going, to leave her behind and never look back. But something in Jess’s voice—the sheer terror—made me pull over to the side of the road, my hands white-knuckling the wheel as I forced myself to breathe.

We sat there in silence, neither of us moving, both of us staring straight ahead, too afraid to look back. The air was thick, suffocating, as though the forest around us was closing in.

Finally, Jess broke the silence, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What… what does she want from us?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that we were trapped on this road, caught in some nightmare that refused to end. The woman was a constant, a silent watcher, appearing at every turn, always waiting, always watching.

As darkness fell, the shadows grew deeper, swallowing the road and everything around us. I started the car again, my hands shaking, and drove on, the headlights barely piercing the darkness.

But as we left her behind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still there, her empty eyes fixed on us, following us into the night.

 

I woke up feeling more drained than I had on any morning before. The room was dim, the curtains drawn tight against a sun that barely seemed to rise, casting only a weak, grayish light through the cracks. Jess was still asleep, her face tense even in slumber, and for a brief moment, I considered not waking her at all. Maybe she’d be better off staying in bed, far from whatever waited for us on the road.

But as much as I wanted to believe we could simply turn back, a sick, crawling feeling told me that no matter which direction we drove, we would end up on the same road—stuck in some terrible loop that we hadn’t meant to enter.

With a heavy heart, I roused Jess, and we packed up in silence. She avoided my gaze, her lips pressed into a thin, tight line. It felt like we were going to our own funeral.

After a quick, silent breakfast, we loaded up the car and set out. The world outside seemed grayer, the trees bare and twisted, as though drained of life. I felt a cold dread seep into my bones as we pulled back onto the road. The GPS flickered, blinking uncertainly for a moment before settling back onto the same route—the road that had held us captive for two days. I barely felt surprised; I knew by now there was no escape.

Jess sat beside me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Neither of us spoke as we drove through the thickening mist, the forest around us looming like a dark, shadowy tunnel, closing in on us as we went.

Hours passed, but the landscape never changed. The trees all looked the same, stretching endlessly on either side, their branches twisted and gnarled. The silence in the car was deafening, pressing in on us, as though the very air had thickened. Every now and then, I’d catch a movement out of the corner of my eye, a flicker in the trees that vanished as soon as I turned my head.

And then, around midday, we saw her again.

The old woman was standing by the roadside, her figure barely visible through the thick fog that had settled over the road. She wore the same faded dress, the same frayed scarf, but something about her was different. Her posture was more rigid, her head tilted slightly to one side, as though she were waiting for us.

I felt Jess’s grip on my arm tighten, her nails digging into my skin. “Don’t stop,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Just keep driving. Please.”

But as we drew closer, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop. It was like some invisible force was tugging at me, urging me to pull over, to get out of the car and walk toward her. My foot hovered over the brake, my hands tightening on the wheel as I struggled to resist.

“She’s just… there,” I said, more to myself than to Jess, my voice hollow. “She’s just… waiting.”

The woman raised her hand, her pale, bony fingers outstretched, beckoning us forward. Her eyes, cold and empty, fixed on me with a piercing intensity that made my skin crawl.

Jess’s voice shook. “Just go, please… don’t look at her. Just go.”

I forced myself to keep driving, my eyes locked on the road ahead, refusing to look back. I could feel her gaze on us, though—burning into the back of my head as we passed her by. It was like a weight, pressing down on me, growing heavier and heavier until I could barely breathe.

Minutes stretched into hours, and still, we drove. The road seemed endless, a looping, unchanging nightmare that refused to release us. The forest grew darker, the fog thickening until I could barely see a few feet in front of us. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners of my vision, and every time I glanced at the GPS, it showed the same unchanging coordinates.

Jess was silent, her face pale, her eyes glazed over with fear. I felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching everything from a distance, my mind slipping further and further away from reality.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to set, the car began to sputter.

I looked down, panic rising in my chest as the fuel gauge dipped suddenly, the needle plunging toward empty. My foot pressed harder on the gas, but the engine choked and sputtered, slowing down until the car rolled to a stop.

“No,” I whispered, my heart pounding. “This can’t be happening. We just filled up this morning. We can’t be out of gas.”

But the car was dead, the engine silent and unresponsive. I looked at Jess, panic clawing at my chest. She was staring out the window, her face frozen in terror.

“She’s here,” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “She’s coming.”

I looked up, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

The old woman was standing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away, her figure barely visible through the fog. Her hand was raised, beckoning us forward, her eyes fixed on me with an unblinking stare.

I felt a chill seep into my bones, freezing me in place. I wanted to move, to get out of the car and run, but I couldn’t. It was like I was rooted to the spot, trapped by her gaze.

Jess grabbed my arm, her voice shaking. “Don’t go… please, don’t go.”

But something inside me was pulling me forward, an irresistible force that I couldn’t ignore. I opened the car door, stepping out into the cold, damp air. The fog clung to my skin, thick and suffocating, as I took a step toward her.

The woman turned and began to walk into the trees, her figure disappearing into the mist. Without thinking, I followed, my legs moving of their own accord, my mind a hazy blur. Jess’s voice faded behind me, her pleas lost in the fog as I followed the woman into the darkness.

She led me deeper into the forest, her footsteps silent on the moss-covered ground. The trees closed in around us, their twisted branches reaching down like skeletal hands, brushing against my skin as I walked. I could hear whispers in the shadows, faint voices murmuring just out of reach, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

Finally, we emerged into a small clearing, and I stopped, my breath catching in my throat.

There was a house in the middle of the clearing, a dilapidated, crumbling structure that looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The windows were shattered, the walls covered in moss and ivy, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. But the woman walked up to the door, turning to look at me with that same, unblinking stare.

“Come inside,” she said, her voice a raspy whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to run, to turn back and find Jess. But something held me in place, a strange, overpowering compulsion that I couldn’t resist. I took a step forward, then another, until I was standing on the threshold, staring into the dark, empty interior.

The woman gestured for me to enter, her face obscured in the shadows. I took a deep breath, stepping over the threshold and into the darkness.

Inside, the air was thick and stale, the walls covered in dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked beneath my feet, and I could barely see anything in the dim light. I turned to look at the woman, but she was gone, vanished into the shadows.

A cold dread settled over me as I realized I was alone.

I tried to back out, but the door had disappeared, the walls around me shifting and warping until I couldn’t tell where I’d entered. Panic surged in my chest, and I stumbled through the dark, my hands brushing against cold, damp walls that seemed to close in around me.

And then I heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the darkness. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as the footsteps grew closer, closer, until they were right behind me.

I turned, my breath hitching as I saw her standing in the shadows, her empty eyes fixed on me, her face twisted into a cold, cruel smile.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty house. “You don’t belong here.”

The world around me began to blur, the walls twisting and melting until I was surrounded by darkness. The last thing I saw was her face, looming over me, her eyes cold and empty, pulling me into the shadows.

And then, everything went black.

The first thing I felt was the warmth of sunlight filtering through my window. My eyes fluttered open, and for a few seconds, I just lay there, staring at the familiar ceiling of my bedroom. The events of the last few days felt like a distant, feverish memory, and a thick fog of confusion settled over me as I tried to piece together what had happened.

Had it all been… a dream?

I sat up slowly, the edges of my mind still hazy, haunted by images of twisted trees, the endless road, and the woman’s piercing, empty gaze. My heart pounded as I remembered her whisper: *“You don’t belong here.”* My breath caught, and I reached up, feeling the sweat beaded on my forehead, my skin cold to the touch.

Looking around, everything seemed normal—my clothes piled on the chair, my bag tossed on the floor, my phone on the nightstand. The digital clock blinked 8:12 AM in neon green. Nothing felt out of place. And yet, a strange heaviness lingered, a weight pressing down on my chest, like the dream hadn’t fully let go of me.

I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. The idea of calling Jess popped into my mind, but something about it filled me with a sense of dread. What if she’d had the same dream? What if the whole thing was some twisted premonition, a warning?

Before I could talk myself out of it, I picked up my phone and called her. After a few rings, Jess answered, her voice groggy but familiar.

“Hello?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

“Jess, it’s me,” I said, my voice sounding strange in my own ears. “Did… did you sleep okay?”

There was a pause on the other end, and I could almost feel her hesitation. “Yeah… I mean, not really,” she admitted. “I had this… this nightmare. It was so real, like I was actually there.”

My heart skipped a beat. “What… what happened in the nightmare?”

Jess took a shaky breath. “We were on this road trip. And we kept seeing this old woman by the road… over and over again. No matter how far we drove, we couldn’t get away from her. And then, on the last day, she invited us inside her house, and…” Her voice trailed off, trembling. “And it was like we were trapped, like we’d never get out.”

My stomach twisted, and I felt a surge of cold dread. “Jess, I… I had the same dream. Exactly the same.”

The silence on the other end of the line felt heavy, weighted with unspoken fear. “This can’t just be a coincidence, can it?” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “It felt so real, like it was some kind of… warning.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Maybe… maybe it was. I don’t know, Jess. But we were supposed to go on that trip today.”

“No way.” Jess’s voice was suddenly firm, edged with panic. “I’m not going. Not after that. There’s something wrong about this, something… dangerous.”

A chill ran down my spine. Part of me wanted to believe it had all just been a strange, shared nightmare, some bizarre trick of our minds. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was more than that, that we’d somehow glimpsed a dark future that had been waiting for us.

I glanced at my packed bags, my heart pounding. It felt like they didn’t belong in my room anymore, like they were somehow tainted by the nightmare. I shivered, looking away, not wanting to touch them.

“I think you’re right,” I said, my voice unsteady. “Maybe… maybe we’re not supposed to go on this trip.”

We sat in silence for a moment, both of us caught in the same silent understanding. The dream had felt like a warning, and neither of us wanted to find out what might happen if we ignored it. The road was calling to us, but it was a call we’d both decided not to answer.

Finally, Jess spoke, her voice low and filled with relief. “Thank you. I don’t think I could go after that… even if I wanted to.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah… me neither.”

We said our goodbyes and hung up, and I let the phone fall from my hand, my fingers numb. The room felt quiet, almost too quiet, and I shivered, feeling that same, lingering unease creeping over me. Even though I was awake, it felt like the dream hadn’t fully let go, like some part of it was still lurking in the corners of my mind, waiting.

And as I lay back down, staring at the ceiling, I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere out there, the woman was waiting, her cold, empty eyes fixed on the road, watching for us.

1gs0ujy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1gs0ujy/im_23_years_old_live_in_a_mcol_city_make_18hr_at/,"I’m 23 years old, live in a MCOL city, make 18/hr at my main gig, and I’m prepping for top surgery! ","I posted a few weeks ago asking if there was any interest in a top surgery focused MD and got a resounding yes, so here I am with that! Thank you all for the well wishes <3 Just as a note: I want to be able to be specific about what most people are interested in (specific costs, financial planning, etc). Because of that, I’m being pretty vague about other stuff so that I don’t doxx myself lol. Sorry in advance if that makes this annoying/boring/unhelpful!

**Section One: Assets and Debt**

Retirement Balance: Around $8400. (\~$7k from my previous job, $1400 from my current job). My current employer matches 25% of up to 6%. For some reason I was sure the max was 4 so I just recently upped my contribution from that (the automatic enrollment) to 6, whoops. 

Savings account balance: $14,711.91 in my personal HYSA. My side gig paychecks go straight into this account and I add whatever I can. It’s intended for my surgery and expenses during recovery, though I’ve taken out of it for some bigger pre op appointment costs too. I also took out of it for a weekend trip my partner and I booked before we knew I would be getting surgery this year. We had a blast and it was really nice to have a last excursion before I’ll be housebound for a bit, but I also wish we would’ve known in time to at least have the option of getting refunded to save $$.

$3858.33 in a joint HYSA with my partner for joint expenses/emergencies/etc. This money is mostly overtime from my previous job, plus some from my partner. I could use this for surgery related expenses if I needed to, but I’m hoping not to have to. We’ve both been focusing on our own savings recently, so nothing has been added to it in \~6 months. It’s a lot lower than I’d like right now due to some emergency dental work for my partner, but we both plan on beefing it back up after I’m recovered.

Checking account balance: $429.91

Credit card debt: $0. I treat my credit card like a debit card and pay it off each month for rewards. 

Student loans: $0. I was incredibly lucky to get a full ride scholarship to a nearby university. I have no idea what I would have done without it. My scholarship covered the first year of housing so I lived in a dorm for one semester and then moved back home when COVID hit. I got into my current apartment soon after and worked full time or more throughout college to cover my expenses. I graduated in 2023 and started my current job about a month after.

Anything else that’s applicable to you: I paid off my car in 2021. She has a KBB value of $2900 but is priceless to me <3

My partner had about $10k in student debt when we met that has since been paid off and no assets. We don’t combine finances outside of our joint but generally plan together and don’t have a super defined method of splitting expenses, so I’ll be including their income info just to give a more accurate picture of our situation.

**Section Two: Income**

Income progression: I’ve been working in my field for about a year, originally making $17/hr. I worked a trade job in college that paid slightly more and had very generous overtime available, so this was a bit of an adjustment. Still, I’m so happy to have landed a job in my field (think humanities) and wouldn’t go back.

I had some absolutely hellish jobs in high school. My trade job was very flexible with my college schedule and I enjoyed the work, but the environment was toxic and stressful. My current job is blessedly flexible and genuinely just really fun, which is a huge relief after years of having a Bad Time. 

Main job monthly take home: $2179.48

Side gig monthly take home: \~$1100, but this varies WILDLY. I started this side gig almost a year ago making 12/hr plus tips and recently got bumped to 14/hr plus tips. I average about 15 hours a week. This number is not counting my raise, which just went into effect. It also doesn’t include cash tips. I save my change and use the bills (usually $4 to $10 a shift) even though I should really probably save them too 😬 cash is fake, right?

Any other monthly take home: I go through phases of scanning receipts, taking surveys on Prolific, and occasionally using gg2u. I’ve made about $200 total from these in the past year. I haven’t been super dedicated to any of them since I started my side gig, but might start again while I’m sitting around recovering.

My partner works in hospitality and brings home roughly $2200 a month, though this varies a bit. They also have a small side gig that brings in roughly $150 a month. 

**Section Three: Expenses**

Rent: $350. This is $700 total, my partner and I equally split. We are super lucky to rent a MIL’s quarters style apartment from a family friend. They will need it in a few years when their oldest starts college, so we’re enjoying it so so hard while it lasts. 

Electric: \~$110. This varies a bit month to month. I pay it in full.

Water: $0. Included in rent.

Wifi: $0. Wifi here seemingly sucks no matter what, so I’m reluctant to pay for it. We use my phone’s hotspot and go to the library if needed.

Savings contribution: $200-$500. Since my side gig goes directly towards savings, I haven’t set a specific additional goal. I generally try to add the maximum I can each month.

Sibling’s 529 account: $160

Mutual aid: $50-$100. 

Pet expenses: \~$30, probably \~$60 total with an equal split. My partner and I have one cat so food and litter last a while, but I am a helicopter cat parent that is always buying puzzle feeders/dental sticks/toys/etc to stimulate her singular brain cell. 

Car insurance: $80 

Phone bill: $75

Testosterone: $88.95 with GoodRx coupon.

Spotify Premium: $19.99. I pay for the family plan that my partner, dad, sibling, dad’s partner, and I share. Rip my student discount. 

Autostraddle A+ subscription: $4. Support gay media!

**The Planning**

I started my side gig almost a year ago. I should be able to move up at my main job and increase my income in the next few years, but I wanted something to help me start saving more, both for surgery and for just general life things. It doesn't take very many ""surprise"" expenses to wipe out my main paycheck, so this has been super helpful. It started adding up way faster than I expected, so I moved my surgery plans up a bit. I had originally been planning to get it in 2025 or 2026, but between the increasing political attacks on trans folks in recent years, the surprisingly quick availability my local gender clinic, and how accepting both my jobs are, I thought it would be smarter to get it done sooner than later in any piece of that puzzle goes south. I've gone through phases of being really strict with my saving and more lax with it depending on what else is going on in life/my brain/etc. I'm hopeful that I don't have any complications and have more than enough put away. If not, I plan to get on a payment plan and just grind as soon as I'm able to get it over with. Fingers crossed that I've planned enough to not have to but I guess we'll see!

**The Surgery**

After lots of research and very helpful input from my care team, I am getting a double incision mastectomy with free nipple grafts (Dr. Hadad at IU Health) and a laparoscopic hysterectomy (Dr. Hathaway at IU Health). Free refers to the type of grafts (taking the nipples completely off and putting them back on), not the cost. The hospital I am going to offers this as a “combo” surgery, so I will be put under once and have both procedures done on the same day.

Being able to get them in one fell swoop was the ultimate deciding factor for me in getting a hysterectomy. I don’t have any interest in getting pregnant or having biological children, but having a uterus doesn’t bother me and I don’t mind my periods any more than (I assume) most cis women do. That being said, between the state of the U.S. at any given moment and the insane lengths I will go to to avoid gyno visits, I have decided that it is better for my long term health to go ahead and get her removed. 

Doing it in combination with top surgery saves a ton on cost and gets all the recovery over with at once so I’m able to avoid two separate periods out of work. I don’t know if I would be able to afford or access a hysterectomy later down the road with the way things are going, so I’m very very very grateful that I can get it done now.

**Cost: Surgery and Appointments**

Obviously, I won’t know the exact costs of the surgery until everything shakes out. This is terrifying! I oscillate between feeling very confident that I’ve saved enough to put myself in a good position and thinking about every stupid $7 coffee I’ve ever bought and how they’re going to cause me financial and medical ruin. My insurance has estimated that I will pay around $4000 out of pocket, which is great, but I am completely unwilling to trust that number until I see it on my final statement. 

Speaking of insurance: I have UMR (UnitedHealthcare) insurance through my dad. We previously had Anthem, who were super helpful with answering questions/estimating costs/communicating with the gender clinic. My dad’s job recently switched to UMR. Both I and the clinic have had a lot of trouble getting them to communicate information both accurately and on time. Transgender surgeries are apparently handled by specialists on their end who seem impossible to get to from any of the publicly available numbers to call. All of this makes me nervous that something will go wrong during this whole thing and really fuck me up, though I’ve read some people report really good experiences with them for top surgery coverage specifically. I guess we’ll see. Please hug an American dealing with the medical system if you have one in your life. 

I’ve listed all my clinic appointments and their costs after insurance below. These are all with my previous Anthem insurance unless otherwise noted. If they are specifically relevant to my surgery, they are starred. I figured this was a good way to get a general idea of overall cost because even those that aren’t surgery focused (intake, HRT check ups) were the gateways to getting surgery (getting into the clinic’s system, getting appointments scheduled, etc). Dates listed are the dates I received the bill, not the date of the appointment.

11/9/23: Intake appointment over the phone. **$64.80**

12/11/23: Initial appointment and bloodwork for HRT. **$159.40**

3/5/24: HRT check up. **$52.02**

\*\*6/7/24: Two social work appointments to receive the WPATH letters required by many insurances for trans surgeries. Both social workers (icons) emphasized how dumb these letters are and how much they hate them as a concept. **$786.70**\*\*

8/12/24: HRT check up and bloodwork. **$92.40**

\*\*9/17/24: Top surgery consult! The doctor walked me through my options, told me what to expect, and took pictures of my boobs for my insurance. I feel like this should have resulted in a discount, especially as they are now limited edition, but my insurance did not feel the same. **$92.40**\*\*

\*\*9/17/24: Hysterectomy consult! Basically the same rigamarole as the top consult but for my uterus. **$214.06**\*\*

11/13/24: HRT check up and bloodwork. Exact same appointment with my new insurance is now **$187.00**

I recently had a pre-op specific appointment where I got bloodwork and was given protein shakes, hydration drinks, and an incentive spirometer that the surgeons require me to use before surgery. I haven’t received a bill for this one yet. I am not excited to see how much the little bag of drinks is going to cost.

The total for all of these appointments is **$1648.78**. The specifically surgery related ones make up the bulk of that because of the WPATH letters, which is ironic because they were easily the shortest appointments. The surgery related grand total is \*\***$1093.16**\*\*.

**Cost: Supplies**

Gender affirming surgery is a great, very exciting thing that can really improve quality of life for trans people. It is also a huge change that can be taxing physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. I’ve read a lot about the “post op blues” that can happen even when people are really happy with their results, have good support networks, and are healing well. I have OCD and have been prone to depression in the past (especially seasonally), so I’m trying to do everything I can to minimize my risk. Obviously having a specific pillow or whatever isn’t going to protect me from the literal biological change in hormone levels, but I’m hoping that having as much taken care of as possible will make things easier and help me regulate. As such, I’ve bought a lot of post op supplies that are probably unnecessary but make me feel better about my chances at a smooth recovery: 

Mastectomy pillow with seat belt cushion. Some people swear by these, some people say they never used them. I figured I’d err on the side of caution. **$42.79**

Recliner (secondhand). Our bed is pretty high off the ground and my partner is known to thrash around in their sleep, so I figured this was the safest method to help me sleep upright and uninjured. I also think it’ll be easier to get out of. I let a family member pick it out so that they could take it after my surgery because it barely fits in our tiny bedroom. **$80**

Robe. **$28.90**

Glasses. This is one of my more frivolous purchases. I got my old glasses in 2020 and never got them fitted because 2020. No matter how much I melt, bend, or secure them, they fall off my face constantly. I don’t imagine I’ll be able to manage contacts and really don’t want to be Velma-ing around with like five open wounds, so I got a new pair that actually fit. **$119.98**

Bidet attachment. My partner and I have been together for five years and are very close and in love. I pray that we will not be on ass-wiping level with each other for many, many years. **$62.99**

Stool softener. No other product on this list was as highly recommended as stool softener. It seems like anesthesia really does a number on people. One of my body’s fun anxiety tricks is also extreme constipation, so I don’t feel like gambling. **$6.49**

Dry shampoo. **$7.69**

Button up shirts (secondhand). You aren’t supposed to raise your arms above your head after surgery, so I grabbed three button up pajama shirts to wear around the house. Two of them came with matching shorts which it’ll probably be too cold for but are still very cute. **$12.97**

Antibacterial bar soap. I have to take two showers before surgery with antibacterial soap to lower my risk of infection. The smallest pack Target had was 3 bars. **$3.99**

The total for these items comes to **$359.80**. It definitely could have been less. We also luckily have a decent amount of medical supplies already (gauze, bandaids, medical tape, etc) because I’m accident prone so I didn’t feel the need to buy a bunch. I imagine that the hospital will probably provide some as well (?). I tried to buy these items slowly over the course of the past few months so that they didn’t have to come out of my savings and didn’t end up being one huge cost all at once. 

**Cost: Time Off**

I have been told to expect roughly 6 weeks out of work. My partner is also taking most of the first week off out of an excess of caution (read: I am stubborn and they are worried I’ll try to do things I’m not supposed to be doing). They don’t get PTO, so this will be unpaid. Neither of my jobs offer PTO, so all of my time off is unpaid. My main gig offers some flexibility with working from home, so I may be able to get some hours after 2 or 3 weeks through that. Both of my bosses are absolute angels and have been very reassuring about my ability to take my time or get hours in however I need to if I need to. This 100% won’t be possible at my side gig because of lift restrictions, but I appreciate the sentiment regardless. I am planning to use my savings and try to keep expenses as low as possible during this period so that I can put recovery first and not rush back to work before I feel ready. That being said, the thought of having 0 income keeps me up at night, especially without a concrete idea of when I’ll be able to get fully back to work or how much the surgery will cost. 

**Totals/Final Thoughts**

The total cost of surgery specific pre-op appointments and supplies comes to **$1452.96.** There are some other costs that aren’t really represented in this: time off for appointments, cutting hours at my side gig to get my apartment ready, etc. This is stretched over \~5ish months though, so I feel like it’s not too bad. A full HALF of it being letters that say “this person might be trans but other than that they are mentally sound, insurance, we promise!!!” is wild to me.

While I have a soapbox for a minute I’ll add: tallying this all up made me realize how expensive this shit is, and how much support it takes to be able to make it all work. Not a lot of people have that, especially not a lot of trans people. I have a lot of thoughts that I won’t put here, but basically just take care of each other. Be vigilant. Be smart. Be kind. We’re all in this together, even and especially when people have a vested interest in pulling us apart.

Surgery is in a few days! I’ll probably come back with a final update once I know total costs of surgery/recovery/time off/etc. Catch y’all on the flip side <3",27,1731689644.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,7,0.79,False

Melatonin Dreams: 7.5/10 

I really like the lofi chords and the vocals are really pretty. I think what held it back a little for me is that the mixes can get really muddy at times, and I can’t always hear what he’s saying. You can tell he really tried to make this a really good first album and the emotion can be felt pretty well even though a lot of the songs are bare. Really great first album 

Fever Dreams: 7/10

I really do like the first couple of tracks and I like the vocal layering becoming more of his sound. I just think what holds this one back is how it’s getting into him being depressed and lonely, it just felt like the same song over and over. While it isn’t bad, it isn’t great in my opinion. Still very listenable though and I still like it

Serotonin Dreams: 8/10

I really like the production on this album and the vocal layering was done miles better than the previous album. Though the depressed emo vibes and lyrics get a little tiring, each song is different and I really like a lot of the more upbeat songs. The mxmtoon, powfu, and blackbear features were all great. Toxic did not need to be in the album at all. Scared Of The Dark would have been the perfect last track. Some of the rawness in the album makes it super fun to listen to and the songs are very catchy.

Lucid Dreams: 8.75/10

This is the album where boywithuke really hone in everything that made his music great. The production is a little more synth-oriented and it often compliments the ukulele pretty well. Though it’s and amazing album, I think it suffers from repetitiveness in the production in some tracks. Songs like Camouflage, Rockstar, and Blue (blue is one of my favorites) do suffer from repetitive production. It makes up for the repetitiveness in it being so well produced though. Sometimes I can’t really hear his voice so it detracts from some songs. I really do like that there was an interlude and unpopular opinion but it’s really good. King Of Nothing is such a beautiful finale track and I think should have been the last boywithuke song period (burnout being his new artist names release).

Burnout: 9/10

Holy shit, I thought this album was going to be confusing as the end of boywithuke but it all makes so much more sense now. Charley is really in his element and you can feel like there is more of a story with the sound. The only reason it’s not. 10 is because some parts are mixed weirdly but that’s personal opinion. I totally wasn’t expecting some songs to be the way they were. I knew how stranger would go yet I was blown away. Same with corduroy and Love Lost (in really great ways). Pitfall had my highest expectations and it’s so fucking good. Coffee isn’t bad by any means but I love the end being something reminiscent of L’amour De Ma Vie (Billie Eilish). This album had a list of emotion and I could tell Charley put his all into this. I thought Easier should’ve been the end at first but then I heard change and was instantly blown away. This makes me very excited for the future of Chandol.

Anyways, I understand everyone has their opinions and that’s totally understandable if you disagree with some of my ratings.

My name is Maria, i am a college student from Colorado, i had planned a road trip with my friend Jess, this is what happened on that road trip…

The road trip had been my idea. Jess had just come out of a messy breakup, and I was drowning in assignments. We needed a break—something far enough from campus to feel like an escape. So, a three-day drive through the mountains, with plans to stay at a friend’s cabin by the coast, sounded perfect. I had everything planned down to the playlists and coffee stops. We left campus at dawn, the sun barely peeking over the horizon as we drove out of town.

The first few hours were bliss. We laughed about the lousy food on campus, ranted about professors who loved to pile on work, and blasted music from our high school days. The air was fresh, the sky a clear, sharp blue, and we had no clue what was coming. Looking back, I almost envy how naive we were then.

As the afternoon dragged on, the landscape around us grew more remote. The trees became denser, towering and twisted, leaning over the road like they were trying to close in around us. Jess had dozed off in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the window, her breathing soft and even. I was getting a little sleepy myself, lulled by the rhythmic sound of tires against pavement. But then I noticed something strange.

Ahead, just off the side of the road, a figure stood motionless by the trees. As we drew closer, I realized it was an old woman. She wore a long, faded dress and a tattered scarf wrapped tightly around her head, hiding most of her face. Her posture was unnaturally stiff, her arms hanging limply at her sides as she stood perfectly still, her eyes fixed on the road.

Something about her felt… wrong. My instincts prickled, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just the sight of someone in such an isolated area, but a weird feeling had settled in my stomach.

We drove past her slowly, and I couldn’t help but glance back in the rearview mirror. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned her head—just stayed there, watching us disappear down the road.

I didn’t wake Jess. I kept driving, brushing off the encounter as some eerie coincidence. Maybe she was a local, waiting for someone, or just… lost. But as the minutes passed, I couldn’t shake the image of her still figure, standing so perfectly still, as though she’d been carved out of stone.

The road stretched on, winding through a seemingly endless forest. The trees grew closer together, casting heavy shadows across the pavement. It felt like we’d been driving for hours, but when I checked the GPS, our location barely seemed to have changed. The blue dot was creeping along at a snail’s pace, and our arrival time was now an hour later than I’d estimated. I checked the clock, frowning. Had we been driving that slowly?

Jess finally stirred beside me, stretching and blinking herself awake. She looked out the window, squinting at the dense forest around us.

""Are we almost there?"" she asked, stifling a yawn.

""Not quite,"" I said, trying to keep my voice casual. ""We’re making slower progress than I thought.""

She shrugged, turning to gaze out the window, but a look of unease settled on her face as she took in the unfamiliar landscape. The mood in the car shifted, the easygoing vibe from earlier replaced with something tense and uneasy. We sat in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the low buzz of static from the radio.

That’s when I saw her again.

I almost missed her, half-hidden by a cluster of trees just ahead. But there she was, the same old woman, standing by the roadside in that faded dress and scarf. Her posture was identical, her arms at her sides, her eyes locked on us. My heart pounded as we drove past, and this time Jess saw her too.

“Whoa… Did you see her?” Jess asked, her voice low and wary. “Isn’t that… the same woman?”

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah. I thought it was just me.”

Jess leaned back, chewing her lip. “How would she get here? There’s no town for miles.”

I didn’t have an answer, and I didn’t want to speculate. The uneasy feeling in my gut had turned into something heavier, a creeping dread that I couldn’t ignore. But as unsettling as it was, I tried to tell myself that there was some reasonable explanation. Maybe she had a car parked nearby, or a house hidden in the woods. Maybe we were just imagining things.

But as we drove on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that somehow, her gaze had followed us long after we’d passed her by.

Night began to fall, the trees casting long, dark shadows across the road. The headlights seemed to barely pierce the thickening darkness, and the silence around us grew almost oppressive. I tried turning on the radio, but only static crackled through the speakers. Even my phone had no signal, the bars stubbornly refusing to budge.

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension thickening with every passing mile. Finally, Jess spoke up, her voice barely more than a whisper.

""Do you… feel like we’re being followed?""

I glanced at her, and for a moment, I considered laughing it off. But the fear in her eyes mirrored my own, and I couldn’t deny it any longer.

""Yeah,"" I admitted, my voice barely steady. ""I feel it too.""

We kept driving, the silence between us stretching taut, both of us too scared to say anything more. As night fully fell, we passed no other cars, no houses, no signs of life—just an unbroken wall of trees pressing in on either side. The road felt endless, stretching out in front of us like it went on forever, leading us deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, after what felt like hours, a dim light appeared in the distance—a small, flickering neon sign on the roof of a rundown motel. Relief flooded through me as I pulled into the gravel lot, the headlights illuminating the faded, peeling paint and grimy windows.

Jess and I hurried inside, booking a room without a second glance at the front desk. The clerk, a wiry man with sunken eyes, barely looked up as he handed us the keys, his gaze fixed somewhere behind us, as though he’d seen something lurking just beyond the glass doors.

The room was sparse and cold, the walls yellowed and cracked. Jess locked the door behind us, checking the window to make sure it was secure. Neither of us spoke about what we’d seen on the road, but the tension was palpable, a silent understanding that we’d experienced something we couldn’t explain.

As I lay in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, I couldn’t shake the image of her—the old woman, standing by the roadside, watching us with that blank, empty stare. I felt her presence lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow that wouldn’t fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, obscured by the scarf, her gaze piercing through the darkness.

Hours passed, but sleep wouldn’t come. And in the silence of that tiny, dilapidated motel room, I could have sworn I heard footsteps outside the door. Slow, shuffling steps, moving back and forth, as though someone was pacing, waiting for something—or someone.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look. I lay frozen in bed, listening to the quiet, steady footsteps until they faded into the night, leaving me lying there, wide-eyed and trembling, waiting for dawn to come.

I woke up early, my body stiff and tense. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as sunlight crept through the thin, yellowed curtains of our motel room. I sat up, trying to push away the fog of sleeplessness and to brush off the memory of that woman standing by the road. But when I looked over at Jess, her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from a restless night, and I knew she’d felt it too.

We packed up in silence, trying to shake off the strange heaviness that lingered from the day before. After a quick stop for coffee, we got back on the road, hoping that a few hours of clear driving would lift the tension that seemed to follow us. But when Jess plugged in the GPS, a chill went down my spine. The screen blinked a few times, showing the same route from yesterday.

""Are you sure that’s the right way?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Jess frowned, tapping at the screen.

""Yeah… I mean, I think so,"" she said, glancing at the map. ""It’s weird, though. It’s like the same road… even though I swear I picked a different route today.""

I laughed nervously. “Maybe it’s just a bad signal.”

She nodded, but her eyes didn’t leave the screen. I could tell she was just as uneasy as I was. Finally, she shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Whatever. Let’s just get going.”

We pulled out of the motel lot and started driving, the road stretching out in front of us in a long, unbroken line. The forest seemed darker than yesterday, the trees pressing in on either side of us, their twisted branches reaching across the road like bony fingers. Shadows pooled under the thick canopy, and every now and then, I’d catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of my vision—just a flicker, gone before I could turn my head to see it clearly.

After an hour or so, Jess turned to me, her face pale. “Is it just me, or does it feel like… like we’re not getting anywhere?”

I checked the clock, frowning. We’d been driving for well over an hour, but the GPS showed only a few miles of progress. I double-checked the fuel gauge. We had plenty of gas, and there was no reason we should be moving this slowly.

“It’s like… the road’s stretching out,” I murmured, trying to make sense of it. But my words hung in the air, unanswered, because how do you explain something like that?

The radio crackled with static, and I turned it off, unwilling to break the tense silence that had settled between us. We drove on, mile after mile, the road twisting through the endless forest like a coiled snake. The sun had barely moved in the sky, stuck in that eerie, pre-noon brightness, casting long shadows that seemed to follow us.

And then we saw her again.

The old woman stood by the side of the road, in the exact same spot as yesterday. She was dressed the same way, her faded dress and frayed scarf stirring in the faint breeze. This time, though, her posture was different—more alert, more… attentive. She stood with one hand raised, palm out, as though signaling us to stop.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt Jess’s hand grip my arm, her fingers cold and tight. “No… No way,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How is she here? She can’t… she can’t be here.”

I forced myself to keep driving, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the rearview mirror. The woman’s face was still obscured by the scarf, but I could feel her eyes on us, following us even as we passed her by. The skin on the back of my neck prickled, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as we left her behind.

Neither of us spoke for a long time after that. Jess sat with her knees drawn up, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as though trying to ward off a chill. I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to look back, afraid of what I might see.

After another hour of silent driving, the road finally seemed to open up a bit. I felt a strange sense of relief, like we’d escaped something that had been closing in on us. We hadn’t seen any signs of life—not a single car, house, or gas station—since leaving the motel, but finally, a small, weathered sign appeared on the side of the road: “Gas, 10 miles.”

I sped up, eager to reach some sign of civilization, even if it was just a rundown gas station in the middle of nowhere.

When we finally reached it, I pulled in, the tires crunching on the gravel as I parked by one of the ancient-looking pumps. The place was eerily quiet, and a sense of unease washed over me as I climbed out of the car. I glanced around, but the station seemed deserted. The windows were covered in grime, and the only sound was the faint, shivering wind rustling through the trees.

Jess stayed in the car, staring at the dashboard as though afraid to look up. I could feel her anxiety from where I stood, but I didn’t blame her. I was barely keeping it together myself.

As I filled the tank, a figure appeared in the doorway of the gas station. I jumped, almost spilling gas on the ground. It was a man, his face obscured by the shadow of his hat, his clothes worn and stained. He watched me for a moment, then stepped out onto the porch, his movements slow and deliberate.

“Headed somewhere?” he asked, his voice rough and low, barely audible over the wind.

I nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah… just passing through.”

He tilted his head, his eyes narrowing slightly as he looked me over. “Be careful out there. Roads don’t always lead where you think they do.”

I felt a chill at his words, but I didn’t know how to respond. He watched me in silence for a moment, then turned and disappeared back into the shadows of the gas station. I hurried back to the car, my heart pounding as I slid into the driver’s seat.

Jess looked at me, her eyes wide. “Did he… did he say anything to you?”

I shook my head, lying without really knowing why. “Nothing important. Let’s just go.”

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension between us thick and oppressive. The road stretched out in front of us, twisting and turning through the endless forest. Every mile felt like a lifetime, and the shadows around us grew darker, thicker, as though something was closing in.

I don’t know how long we drove—time felt meaningless, slipping away in the endless monotony of the road. But as evening began to fall, the light fading into a murky twilight, I saw something ahead that made my heart stop.

The old woman.

She was standing in the same spot as before, her back straight, her gaze fixed on us. Her hand was raised again, palm out, as though warning us to stop. This time, though, her face was turned directly toward us, and I could finally see her eyes.

They were pale and empty, like glass, staring into me with a cold intensity that made my blood run cold. I looked away, unable to hold her gaze, and kept driving, my hands shaking on the wheel.

As we passed her, Jess grabbed my arm, her voice tight with fear. “Stop. Just stop the car.”

I didn’t want to, every instinct telling me to keep going, to leave her behind and never look back. But something in Jess’s voice—the sheer terror—made me pull over to the side of the road, my hands white-knuckling the wheel as I forced myself to breathe.

We sat there in silence, neither of us moving, both of us staring straight ahead, too afraid to look back. The air was thick, suffocating, as though the forest around us was closing in.

Finally, Jess broke the silence, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What… what does she want from us?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that we were trapped on this road, caught in some nightmare that refused to end. The woman was a constant, a silent watcher, appearing at every turn, always waiting, always watching.

As darkness fell, the shadows grew deeper, swallowing the road and everything around us. I started the car again, my hands shaking, and drove on, the headlights barely piercing the darkness.

But as we left her behind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still there, her empty eyes fixed on us, following us into the night.

 

I woke up feeling more drained than I had on any morning before. The room was dim, the curtains drawn tight against a sun that barely seemed to rise, casting only a weak, grayish light through the cracks. Jess was still asleep, her face tense even in slumber, and for a brief moment, I considered not waking her at all. Maybe she’d be better off staying in bed, far from whatever waited for us on the road.

But as much as I wanted to believe we could simply turn back, a sick, crawling feeling told me that no matter which direction we drove, we would end up on the same road—stuck in some terrible loop that we hadn’t meant to enter.

With a heavy heart, I roused Jess, and we packed up in silence. She avoided my gaze, her lips pressed into a thin, tight line. It felt like we were going to our own funeral.

After a quick, silent breakfast, we loaded up the car and set out. The world outside seemed grayer, the trees bare and twisted, as though drained of life. I felt a cold dread seep into my bones as we pulled back onto the road. The GPS flickered, blinking uncertainly for a moment before settling back onto the same route—the road that had held us captive for two days. I barely felt surprised; I knew by now there was no escape.

Jess sat beside me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Neither of us spoke as we drove through the thickening mist, the forest around us looming like a dark, shadowy tunnel, closing in on us as we went.

Hours passed, but the landscape never changed. The trees all looked the same, stretching endlessly on either side, their branches twisted and gnarled. The silence in the car was deafening, pressing in on us, as though the very air had thickened. Every now and then, I’d catch a movement out of the corner of my eye, a flicker in the trees that vanished as soon as I turned my head.

And then, around midday, we saw her again.

The old woman was standing by the roadside, her figure barely visible through the thick fog that had settled over the road. She wore the same faded dress, the same frayed scarf, but something about her was different. Her posture was more rigid, her head tilted slightly to one side, as though she were waiting for us.

I felt Jess’s grip on my arm tighten, her nails digging into my skin. “Don’t stop,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Just keep driving. Please.”

But as we drew closer, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop. It was like some invisible force was tugging at me, urging me to pull over, to get out of the car and walk toward her. My foot hovered over the brake, my hands tightening on the wheel as I struggled to resist.

“She’s just… there,” I said, more to myself than to Jess, my voice hollow. “She’s just… waiting.”

The woman raised her hand, her pale, bony fingers outstretched, beckoning us forward. Her eyes, cold and empty, fixed on me with a piercing intensity that made my skin crawl.

Jess’s voice shook. “Just go, please… don’t look at her. Just go.”

I forced myself to keep driving, my eyes locked on the road ahead, refusing to look back. I could feel her gaze on us, though—burning into the back of my head as we passed her by. It was like a weight, pressing down on me, growing heavier and heavier until I could barely breathe.

Minutes stretched into hours, and still, we drove. The road seemed endless, a looping, unchanging nightmare that refused to release us. The forest grew darker, the fog thickening until I could barely see a few feet in front of us. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners of my vision, and every time I glanced at the GPS, it showed the same unchanging coordinates.

Jess was silent, her face pale, her eyes glazed over with fear. I felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching everything from a distance, my mind slipping further and further away from reality.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to set, the car began to sputter.

I looked down, panic rising in my chest as the fuel gauge dipped suddenly, the needle plunging toward empty. My foot pressed harder on the gas, but the engine choked and sputtered, slowing down until the car rolled to a stop.

“No,” I whispered, my heart pounding. “This can’t be happening. We just filled up this morning. We can’t be out of gas.”

But the car was dead, the engine silent and unresponsive. I looked at Jess, panic clawing at my chest. She was staring out the window, her face frozen in terror.

“She’s here,” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “She’s coming.”

I looked up, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

The old woman was standing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away, her figure barely visible through the fog. Her hand was raised, beckoning us forward, her eyes fixed on me with an unblinking stare.

I felt a chill seep into my bones, freezing me in place. I wanted to move, to get out of the car and run, but I couldn’t. It was like I was rooted to the spot, trapped by her gaze.

Jess grabbed my arm, her voice shaking. “Don’t go… please, don’t go.”

But something inside me was pulling me forward, an irresistible force that I couldn’t ignore. I opened the car door, stepping out into the cold, damp air. The fog clung to my skin, thick and suffocating, as I took a step toward her.

The woman turned and began to walk into the trees, her figure disappearing into the mist. Without thinking, I followed, my legs moving of their own accord, my mind a hazy blur. Jess’s voice faded behind me, her pleas lost in the fog as I followed the woman into the darkness.

She led me deeper into the forest, her footsteps silent on the moss-covered ground. The trees closed in around us, their twisted branches reaching down like skeletal hands, brushing against my skin as I walked. I could hear whispers in the shadows, faint voices murmuring just out of reach, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

Finally, we emerged into a small clearing, and I stopped, my breath catching in my throat.

There was a house in the middle of the clearing, a dilapidated, crumbling structure that looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The windows were shattered, the walls covered in moss and ivy, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. But the woman walked up to the door, turning to look at me with that same, unblinking stare.

“Come inside,” she said, her voice a raspy whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to run, to turn back and find Jess. But something held me in place, a strange, overpowering compulsion that I couldn’t resist. I took a step forward, then another, until I was standing on the threshold, staring into the dark, empty interior.

The woman gestured for me to enter, her face obscured in the shadows. I took a deep breath, stepping over the threshold and into the darkness.

Inside, the air was thick and stale, the walls covered in dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked beneath my feet, and I could barely see anything in the dim light. I turned to look at the woman, but she was gone, vanished into the shadows.

A cold dread settled over me as I realized I was alone.

I tried to back out, but the door had disappeared, the walls around me shifting and warping until I couldn’t tell where I’d entered. Panic surged in my chest, and I stumbled through the dark, my hands brushing against cold, damp walls that seemed to close in around me.

And then I heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the darkness. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as the footsteps grew closer, closer, until they were right behind me.

I turned, my breath hitching as I saw her standing in the shadows, her empty eyes fixed on me, her face twisted into a cold, cruel smile.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty house. “You don’t belong here.”

The world around me began to blur, the walls twisting and melting until I was surrounded by darkness. The last thing I saw was her face, looming over me, her eyes cold and empty, pulling me into the shadows.

And then, everything went black.

The first thing I felt was the warmth of sunlight filtering through my window. My eyes fluttered open, and for a few seconds, I just lay there, staring at the familiar ceiling of my bedroom. The events of the last few days felt like a distant, feverish memory, and a thick fog of confusion settled over me as I tried to piece together what had happened.

Had it all been… a dream?

I sat up slowly, the edges of my mind still hazy, haunted by images of twisted trees, the endless road, and the woman’s piercing, empty gaze. My heart pounded as I remembered her whisper: *“You don’t belong here.”* My breath caught, and I reached up, feeling the sweat beaded on my forehead, my skin cold to the touch.

Looking around, everything seemed normal—my clothes piled on the chair, my bag tossed on the floor, my phone on the nightstand. The digital clock blinked 8:12 AM in neon green. Nothing felt out of place. And yet, a strange heaviness lingered, a weight pressing down on my chest, like the dream hadn’t fully let go of me.

I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. The idea of calling Jess popped into my mind, but something about it filled me with a sense of dread. What if she’d had the same dream? What if the whole thing was some twisted premonition, a warning?

Before I could talk myself out of it, I picked up my phone and called her. After a few rings, Jess answered, her voice groggy but familiar.

“Hello?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

“Jess, it’s me,” I said, my voice sounding strange in my own ears. “Did… did you sleep okay?”

There was a pause on the other end, and I could almost feel her hesitation. “Yeah… I mean, not really,” she admitted. “I had this… this nightmare. It was so real, like I was actually there.”

My heart skipped a beat. “What… what happened in the nightmare?”

Jess took a shaky breath. “We were on this road trip. And we kept seeing this old woman by the road… over and over again. No matter how far we drove, we couldn’t get away from her. And then, on the last day, she invited us inside her house, and…” Her voice trailed off, trembling. “And it was like we were trapped, like we’d never get out.”

My stomach twisted, and I felt a surge of cold dread. “Jess, I… I had the same dream. Exactly the same.”

The silence on the other end of the line felt heavy, weighted with unspoken fear. “This can’t just be a coincidence, can it?” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “It felt so real, like it was some kind of… warning.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Maybe… maybe it was. I don’t know, Jess. But we were supposed to go on that trip today.”

“No way.” Jess’s voice was suddenly firm, edged with panic. “I’m not going. Not after that. There’s something wrong about this, something… dangerous.”

A chill ran down my spine. Part of me wanted to believe it had all just been a strange, shared nightmare, some bizarre trick of our minds. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was more than that, that we’d somehow glimpsed a dark future that had been waiting for us.

I glanced at my packed bags, my heart pounding. It felt like they didn’t belong in my room anymore, like they were somehow tainted by the nightmare. I shivered, looking away, not wanting to touch them.

“I think you’re right,” I said, my voice unsteady. “Maybe… maybe we’re not supposed to go on this trip.”

We sat in silence for a moment, both of us caught in the same silent understanding. The dream had felt like a warning, and neither of us wanted to find out what might happen if we ignored it. The road was calling to us, but it was a call we’d both decided not to answer.

Finally, Jess spoke, her voice low and filled with relief. “Thank you. I don’t think I could go after that… even if I wanted to.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah… me neither.”

We said our goodbyes and hung up, and I let the phone fall from my hand, my fingers numb. The room felt quiet, almost too quiet, and I shivered, feeling that same, lingering unease creeping over me. Even though I was awake, it felt like the dream hadn’t fully let go, like some part of it was still lurking in the corners of my mind, waiting.

And as I lay back down, staring at the ceiling, I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere out there, the woman was waiting, her cold, empty eyes fixed on the road, watching for us.

I’m a decent looking guy, 5’11” and 170 lbs with a 5” dick, whereas Megan is a cute brunette, 5’8” 130 lbs with nice B cups and a hot ass. I proposed to her this past June and I guess what started this whole thing was when we moved into our first apartment together in July. We live in the city now and found a perfect apartment loft which we both fell in love with in a trendy part of the city. The day we moved in, Megan had to work so it was me just moving stuff in and our neighbor across the hall had heard me moving stuff and opened the door to introduce himself. Alex (27) is a handsome guy, probably 6’2” and in incredible shape. He helped me move stuff in until we were done and I offered him a beer and ordered some pizza as a thank you. Over the next couple months we came pretty good friends.

We’d have Alex over quite a bit and would often hang out at his place when he didn’t have a girl over. Well on a Friday this past September, Alex knocked on my door early around 6 am as I was making coffee and about to hop in the shower to get ready for work. He said his water was shut off due to a plumbing issue and asked if he could take a shower. I told him to go ahead and sat on the couch while he went to our bathroom. Megan usually sleeps in later than me and gets up around 630 to take a shower. This time I heard our bedroom door open and the bathroom door open and then shut a minute later. I assumed he told her that he was borrowing our shower and I heard our bedroom door close. He walked out 10 minutes later and thanked me and left. I then went to take a shower and when I went into the bedroom I walked in on Megan masturbating. She seemed embarrassed but I quickly got into bed and fucked her before getting dressed and heading out for work.

I got home around 5 that evening and Megan asked me if I wanted to watch some porn. We do this occasionally but only after a few drinks. I could tell she had already opened a bottle of wine so I could tell she was feeling pretty horny. I grabbed a drink for myself and we began browsing some videos but she kept clicking on videos as if she was looking for something. I inquired as to what she was looking for and she asked me not to judge but she was looking for some big dick porn. I told her that it would be hot and she typed in hot wife gets fucked by huge cock. I was a little surprised, especially when the video turned out to feature a cute wife fucking a big dick in front of her husband but she was so turned on as we both masturbated to it. She then had me fuck her and was very vocal about me fucking her with my giant cock. I know i’m not big but it was very hot hearing it all. We fucked a few times that night as she just couldn’t seem to get enough.

The next night, Megan went out shopping and when she got home she took the bags straight to the room. I followed her in and asked what she got. She showed me a sexy lingerie that she picked up and told me that she got us a toy. Intrigued, I asked her to show me but she seemed very hesitant. I pressed again and she reluctantly stated that she had bought something for me to use on her. I asked what it was and she showed me a penis extension sleeve that added a few inches and some girth. Immediately I asked her if I was not enough but she reassured me that I was but she thought it would be sexy to introduce some role playing into our sex life. I asked what she meant and she said that it would be hot for me to pick her up at a bar and fuck her with this big dick cock sleeve. She said she would be a lonely wife who would get picked up by a single guy with a big dick. She reassured me that it would be such a turn on so I went along with it. We got ready for the evening and she said she was going to go down to the bar around the corner from our apartment. After my shower, I put the cock sleeve on and have to admit it felt pretty good to have a huge thick cock. I pulled up my underwear and pants and they felt tight around this big fake dick and I noticed a sizable bulge visible from the front of my pants.

I went down to the bar to meet her and pretended that we were strangers. I offered to buy her drink after drink and eventually invited her back to my place for a movie. Once we got back to the apartment, I began kissing her and she immediately knelt down to take out my giant fake cock. She began kissing it and sucking it while telling me how much bigger it was than her husbands little dick. She begged me to fuck her and I did so while she continue to cum at least twice. Finally, I felt like I wanted to cum so I pulled out and had her get on her knees while I took the sleeve off and came all over her lips. Megan then stood up and leaned in for a kiss. I backed away but she grabbed the back of my head and begged me to make out with her. As i did so, she licked her lips and then mine while pushing my own cum into my mouth with her tongue. It felt weird but kind of hot because of how turned on she was by it all. We then went and showered and went to watch a movie on the couch until I asked her what all this was about. The big dick cuckold porn, the fake cock and cheating role playing. She got really quiet and was reluctant to tell me but I pressed a bit more and she finally said that she had walked in on Alex in the shower. She thought it was me in there but when she opened the curtain to get in she noticed that it was him and that he had a huge cock. She admitted that she couldn’t stop thinking about it all day and wondered what it would feel like inside of her.

I pressed a little more and she told me how good it looked hanging halfway down his thigh and how thick it was. That night we watched a movie and I think she regretted telling me any of this but all I could think about was Megan, my fiancé, wanting to fuck Alex’s huge cock. The next day Megan went out to target and I invited Alex over for some beers. After a couple of beers, I finally brought up the shower incident to which he acknowledged that she opened up the curtain and saw him naked. I told him it wasn’t a big deal but apparently she was pretty impressed with what she saw. He smirked and asked if she said anything else about him to which I responded that she ended up picking me up a cock sleeve and had us watch big dick cuckold porn. He apologized for any issues but told me that he was there if there was anything he could do to help us. I got quiet for a minute before asking if he’d like to fuck Megan. Alex said that while he would, he didn’t want to ruin our relationship so would have to decline. “What if we both want you to?” I asked.  He responded that he would love to fuck her but only if we were both 100% on board. I told him I was and then asked him how big he was. I told him I was about 5” to which he chuckled and said he was quite a bit bigger than that at roughly 9”. He asked if I wanted to see and I just nodded until he pulled his pants down revealing his gigantic cock. I stared for a bit until he put it away. I couldn’t imagine that going inside Megan and her pussy wasn’t that big but she obviously thought it would be a good fit.

About a minute later Megan walked in and asked if we were talking about her because we got quiet when she walked in. I told her no and that she should grab a drink and come join us. She was wearing a cute pink tank top and some white yoga pants which showed off her amazing ass. We kept drinking and chatting and I just kept thinking about how sexy her mouth looked and how beautiful she would look with a huge cock in it. Alex got up to get another beer and said that we were out so he was going to run down to the corner store and buy some more. While he was gone, I told Megan how I brought up her catching him in the shower and I told him that it made her really horny. She seemed embarrassed but I continued that he said he’d like to fuck her if we were both ok with it. “Are you ok with him fucking me?” She asked? In my buzzed and horny state I told her that I was and how hot it would be to watch her take his huge 9” cock. She laughed asked how I knew how big it was and I told her he showed it to me and told me how big it was.

She seemed intrigued by this and asked me to describe it to her. I explained that it was massive and, like she said, seemed to go halfway down his thigh. She asked for more details and I told her how it was thick but not too thick. Perfectly proportional and how it looked like the perfect cock for porn. As I was describing it, I started getting hard and adjusted myself and Megan noticed and grabbed my hard dick through my pants. “Oh my god! Are you getting hard thinking about his cock!” She said. “No! I’m just thinking about how hot it would be for you to suck and fuck him!” I responded. While this was true, I couldn’t help but think about how amazing his cock looked and I was really curious how it would look hard and how much he could cum.

Alex walked in soon after with more beer and saw Megan rubbing the front of my pants. He asked if he should leave us alone and Megan surprised both of us by standing up and pulling her tits out. Alex stared and looked shocked while she explained that she had seen him so it was only fair that he see her. She then put her boobs away and turned around, bending over and pulling her yoga pants down exposing her ass and pussy from behind. She then pulled them back up and sat down on the couch as if nothing had happened. Alex seemed lost for words and looked at me. I just asked if he liked what he saw and he nodded. Megan then said that she wouldn’t mind seeing him again and he then started pulling his pants down revealing his gigantic cock. Megan’s eyes got wide as she stared and I noticed her biting her lower lip while totally fixated on his 9” cock. I was still rock hard at this time and she told me to pull out my dick and stand next to him. As I pulled it out, Megan told Alex how we were talking about his dick while he was gone and it got me worked up. Looking at his soft cock next to my hard dick she seemed really amused and laughed while stating how it was bigger soft than my hard dick. He looked over and said that it wasn’t difficult being bigger than me.

Megan grabbed my hard dick and started stroking it before asking “Babe, are you sure about this?”. I was so hard and turned on that I just nodded. She then grabbed Alex’s cock and began stroking it while she got on her knees. I watched as it grew and grew. She then kissed the tip of his cock a few times before licking it and sticking the head of it in her mouth. Finally, he was fully hard and she put our dicks next to each other and just let out a big “wow!”. I already felt like cumming and Megan felt me tense up so she immediately let go and told me not to cum yet. “Go have a seat and just watch. I don’t want you cumming too early” she told me. Plus she said she needed two hands for him anyway. I sat down and watched as she went back to stroking and sucking Alex’s huge cock until he lied on the couch and asked her to sit on his face. I couldn’t believe I was jerking off while watching my fiancé 69 our friend. He had his hands on her ass while he licked her pussy all while she sucked and jerked his big dick. Finally, he laid her down on the couch and I watched while he slowly inserted himself into her. As I watched it go in, I heard her let out a big “Oooohhh!”.

Over the next 20 minutes I continued jerking off while watching him fuck her in almost every position. Missionary, she rode him, doggy style. She came at least 3 times while I myself almost came at least a dozen times. Each time I took my hand away from my dick until the feeling went away and then continued to stroke myself. This went on until Alex said he was going to cum and asked where he could. “Anywhere you want!” She said. He then had Megan get on her knees and he emptied a massive load of cum directly in her mouth. I watched as she swallowed it all and began to suck his cock to make sure she had got it all out. He collapsed on the couch and Megan then came over to me and said it was my turn to cum. She sat on my lap, inserting me in her freshly fucked pussy, and rode me for about 30 seconds before I told her I was going to cum. She quickly hopped off of me and started stroking my dick as I released my pent up load of cum.

I closed my eyes and had my mouth open as I came and instantly felt a huge load of cum hit my mouth. Megan excitedly yelled “Yes!” as I shot another load that hit my lips. The third spurt hit my chin and the fourth and fifth hit my chest and stomach. She then asked to see what I had in my mouth and as I opened up she smiled and told me to swallow it for her. Alex just laughed while Megan said that if I wanted some cum that I should have asked and she would have shared with me. I sat there embarrassed and covered in my own cum as Megan got up and sat down next to Alex. She grabbed his cock and asked if he was up for another round since I couldn’t fuck her good enough. I watched as he started getting hard and she began sucking his cock again. Alex fucked Megan again for half an hour while I stroked myself. I watched as she came a few more times while enjoying his big cock until he told her to get on her knees and take his cum in her mouth. Once he finished filling up her mouth with another load, she got up and sat down next to me and grabbed the back of my head to bring me in for a passionate kiss. We made out while she stroked me and I begged her to make me cum.

I told her I wanted her to suck my cock but after only a minute of her sucking me I started cumming in her mouth. Megan swallowed my cum and then leaned in and gave me a kiss before leaving us to go take a shower. Alex thanked me as he got dressed and got up to leave. I went and joined Megan in the shower and we got cleaned up and got dressed in pajamas and went out into the living room to watch a movie. As we watched a movie, I couldn’t but help and ask her if he fucked her better than I did. Megan asked me not to do this and just watch the movie. I pressed her and she gave in and told me that while he had a bigger cock and fucked her better, she loved me and that’s why she was marrying me. She asked me if I regretted any of it and I brushed her hair and told her that I loved her so much more.

I began making out with her while rubbing her tits and she asked me to tell her my favorite part of the evening. I told her I loved it all but especially watching him cum in her mouth twice. “Did you like tasting his cum from my lips? She asked? 

Since then, we’ve had Alex over quite a few more times. I’ll try to make some time and post the rest of our encounters here soon.",1,1731689593.0,u_FZR600000,0,1.0,False

Noob here.  There who talk about DIY dubbing seem to universally recommend a coffee grinder, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on inside the grinder.  Is it cutting the fibers shorter?  Is it mixing them well?  Is it partially matting/felting them together?  



*Edit to add more questions *

So what fiber length are we going for here?  Also, is the coffee grinder doing something to the dubbing material (like yarn) that won't be achieved by cutting short pieces of yarn and pulling it apart by hand, or is it mostly a time saver?  

Also thanks for the answers so far!",3,1731689593.0,flytying,4,1.0,False

1gs0thl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gs0thl/the_old_lady_by_the_road/,The Old Lady By The Road,"My name is Maria, i am a college student from Colorado, i had planned a road trip with my friend Jess, this is what happened on that road trip…

The road trip had been my idea. Jess had just come out of a messy breakup, and I was drowning in assignments. We needed a break—something far enough from campus to feel like an escape. So, a three-day drive through the mountains, with plans to stay at a friend’s cabin by the coast, sounded perfect. I had everything planned down to the playlists and coffee stops. We left campus at dawn, the sun barely peeking over the horizon as we drove out of town.

The first few hours were bliss. We laughed about the lousy food on campus, ranted about professors who loved to pile on work, and blasted music from our high school days. The air was fresh, the sky a clear, sharp blue, and we had no clue what was coming. Looking back, I almost envy how naive we were then.

As the afternoon dragged on, the landscape around us grew more remote. The trees became denser, towering and twisted, leaning over the road like they were trying to close in around us. Jess had dozed off in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the window, her breathing soft and even. I was getting a little sleepy myself, lulled by the rhythmic sound of tires against pavement. But then I noticed something strange.

Ahead, just off the side of the road, a figure stood motionless by the trees. As we drew closer, I realized it was an old woman. She wore a long, faded dress and a tattered scarf wrapped tightly around her head, hiding most of her face. Her posture was unnaturally stiff, her arms hanging limply at her sides as she stood perfectly still, her eyes fixed on the road.

Something about her felt… wrong. My instincts prickled, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just the sight of someone in such an isolated area, but a weird feeling had settled in my stomach.

We drove past her slowly, and I couldn’t help but glance back in the rearview mirror. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned her head—just stayed there, watching us disappear down the road.

I didn’t wake Jess. I kept driving, brushing off the encounter as some eerie coincidence. Maybe she was a local, waiting for someone, or just… lost. But as the minutes passed, I couldn’t shake the image of her still figure, standing so perfectly still, as though she’d been carved out of stone.

The road stretched on, winding through a seemingly endless forest. The trees grew closer together, casting heavy shadows across the pavement. It felt like we’d been driving for hours, but when I checked the GPS, our location barely seemed to have changed. The blue dot was creeping along at a snail’s pace, and our arrival time was now an hour later than I’d estimated. I checked the clock, frowning. Had we been driving that slowly?

Jess finally stirred beside me, stretching and blinking herself awake. She looked out the window, squinting at the dense forest around us.

""Are we almost there?"" she asked, stifling a yawn.

""Not quite,"" I said, trying to keep my voice casual. ""We’re making slower progress than I thought.""

She shrugged, turning to gaze out the window, but a look of unease settled on her face as she took in the unfamiliar landscape. The mood in the car shifted, the easygoing vibe from earlier replaced with something tense and uneasy. We sat in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the low buzz of static from the radio.

That’s when I saw her again.

I almost missed her, half-hidden by a cluster of trees just ahead. But there she was, the same old woman, standing by the roadside in that faded dress and scarf. Her posture was identical, her arms at her sides, her eyes locked on us. My heart pounded as we drove past, and this time Jess saw her too.

“Whoa… Did you see her?” Jess asked, her voice low and wary. “Isn’t that… the same woman?”

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah. I thought it was just me.”

Jess leaned back, chewing her lip. “How would she get here? There’s no town for miles.”

I didn’t have an answer, and I didn’t want to speculate. The uneasy feeling in my gut had turned into something heavier, a creeping dread that I couldn’t ignore. But as unsettling as it was, I tried to tell myself that there was some reasonable explanation. Maybe she had a car parked nearby, or a house hidden in the woods. Maybe we were just imagining things.

But as we drove on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that somehow, her gaze had followed us long after we’d passed her by.

Night began to fall, the trees casting long, dark shadows across the road. The headlights seemed to barely pierce the thickening darkness, and the silence around us grew almost oppressive. I tried turning on the radio, but only static crackled through the speakers. Even my phone had no signal, the bars stubbornly refusing to budge.

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension thickening with every passing mile. Finally, Jess spoke up, her voice barely more than a whisper.

""Do you… feel like we’re being followed?""

I glanced at her, and for a moment, I considered laughing it off. But the fear in her eyes mirrored my own, and I couldn’t deny it any longer.

""Yeah,"" I admitted, my voice barely steady. ""I feel it too.""

We kept driving, the silence between us stretching taut, both of us too scared to say anything more. As night fully fell, we passed no other cars, no houses, no signs of life—just an unbroken wall of trees pressing in on either side. The road felt endless, stretching out in front of us like it went on forever, leading us deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, after what felt like hours, a dim light appeared in the distance—a small, flickering neon sign on the roof of a rundown motel. Relief flooded through me as I pulled into the gravel lot, the headlights illuminating the faded, peeling paint and grimy windows.

Jess and I hurried inside, booking a room without a second glance at the front desk. The clerk, a wiry man with sunken eyes, barely looked up as he handed us the keys, his gaze fixed somewhere behind us, as though he’d seen something lurking just beyond the glass doors.

The room was sparse and cold, the walls yellowed and cracked. Jess locked the door behind us, checking the window to make sure it was secure. Neither of us spoke about what we’d seen on the road, but the tension was palpable, a silent understanding that we’d experienced something we couldn’t explain.

As I lay in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, I couldn’t shake the image of her—the old woman, standing by the roadside, watching us with that blank, empty stare. I felt her presence lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow that wouldn’t fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, obscured by the scarf, her gaze piercing through the darkness.

Hours passed, but sleep wouldn’t come. And in the silence of that tiny, dilapidated motel room, I could have sworn I heard footsteps outside the door. Slow, shuffling steps, moving back and forth, as though someone was pacing, waiting for something—or someone.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look. I lay frozen in bed, listening to the quiet, steady footsteps until they faded into the night, leaving me lying there, wide-eyed and trembling, waiting for dawn to come.

I woke up early, my body stiff and tense. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as sunlight crept through the thin, yellowed curtains of our motel room. I sat up, trying to push away the fog of sleeplessness and to brush off the memory of that woman standing by the road. But when I looked over at Jess, her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from a restless night, and I knew she’d felt it too.

We packed up in silence, trying to shake off the strange heaviness that lingered from the day before. After a quick stop for coffee, we got back on the road, hoping that a few hours of clear driving would lift the tension that seemed to follow us. But when Jess plugged in the GPS, a chill went down my spine. The screen blinked a few times, showing the same route from yesterday.

""Are you sure that’s the right way?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Jess frowned, tapping at the screen.

""Yeah… I mean, I think so,"" she said, glancing at the map. ""It’s weird, though. It’s like the same road… even though I swear I picked a different route today.""

I laughed nervously. “Maybe it’s just a bad signal.”

She nodded, but her eyes didn’t leave the screen. I could tell she was just as uneasy as I was. Finally, she shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Whatever. Let’s just get going.”

We pulled out of the motel lot and started driving, the road stretching out in front of us in a long, unbroken line. The forest seemed darker than yesterday, the trees pressing in on either side of us, their twisted branches reaching across the road like bony fingers. Shadows pooled under the thick canopy, and every now and then, I’d catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of my vision—just a flicker, gone before I could turn my head to see it clearly.

After an hour or so, Jess turned to me, her face pale. “Is it just me, or does it feel like… like we’re not getting anywhere?”

I checked the clock, frowning. We’d been driving for well over an hour, but the GPS showed only a few miles of progress. I double-checked the fuel gauge. We had plenty of gas, and there was no reason we should be moving this slowly.

“It’s like… the road’s stretching out,” I murmured, trying to make sense of it. But my words hung in the air, unanswered, because how do you explain something like that?

The radio crackled with static, and I turned it off, unwilling to break the tense silence that had settled between us. We drove on, mile after mile, the road twisting through the endless forest like a coiled snake. The sun had barely moved in the sky, stuck in that eerie, pre-noon brightness, casting long shadows that seemed to follow us.

And then we saw her again.

The old woman stood by the side of the road, in the exact same spot as yesterday. She was dressed the same way, her faded dress and frayed scarf stirring in the faint breeze. This time, though, her posture was different—more alert, more… attentive. She stood with one hand raised, palm out, as though signaling us to stop.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt Jess’s hand grip my arm, her fingers cold and tight. “No… No way,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How is she here? She can’t… she can’t be here.”

I forced myself to keep driving, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the rearview mirror. The woman’s face was still obscured by the scarf, but I could feel her eyes on us, following us even as we passed her by. The skin on the back of my neck prickled, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as we left her behind.

Neither of us spoke for a long time after that. Jess sat with her knees drawn up, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as though trying to ward off a chill. I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to look back, afraid of what I might see.

After another hour of silent driving, the road finally seemed to open up a bit. I felt a strange sense of relief, like we’d escaped something that had been closing in on us. We hadn’t seen any signs of life—not a single car, house, or gas station—since leaving the motel, but finally, a small, weathered sign appeared on the side of the road: “Gas, 10 miles.”

I sped up, eager to reach some sign of civilization, even if it was just a rundown gas station in the middle of nowhere.

When we finally reached it, I pulled in, the tires crunching on the gravel as I parked by one of the ancient-looking pumps. The place was eerily quiet, and a sense of unease washed over me as I climbed out of the car. I glanced around, but the station seemed deserted. The windows were covered in grime, and the only sound was the faint, shivering wind rustling through the trees.

Jess stayed in the car, staring at the dashboard as though afraid to look up. I could feel her anxiety from where I stood, but I didn’t blame her. I was barely keeping it together myself.

As I filled the tank, a figure appeared in the doorway of the gas station. I jumped, almost spilling gas on the ground. It was a man, his face obscured by the shadow of his hat, his clothes worn and stained. He watched me for a moment, then stepped out onto the porch, his movements slow and deliberate.

“Headed somewhere?” he asked, his voice rough and low, barely audible over the wind.

I nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah… just passing through.”

He tilted his head, his eyes narrowing slightly as he looked me over. “Be careful out there. Roads don’t always lead where you think they do.”

I felt a chill at his words, but I didn’t know how to respond. He watched me in silence for a moment, then turned and disappeared back into the shadows of the gas station. I hurried back to the car, my heart pounding as I slid into the driver’s seat.

Jess looked at me, her eyes wide. “Did he… did he say anything to you?”

I shook my head, lying without really knowing why. “Nothing important. Let’s just go.”

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension between us thick and oppressive. The road stretched out in front of us, twisting and turning through the endless forest. Every mile felt like a lifetime, and the shadows around us grew darker, thicker, as though something was closing in.

I don’t know how long we drove—time felt meaningless, slipping away in the endless monotony of the road. But as evening began to fall, the light fading into a murky twilight, I saw something ahead that made my heart stop.

The old woman.

She was standing in the same spot as before, her back straight, her gaze fixed on us. Her hand was raised again, palm out, as though warning us to stop. This time, though, her face was turned directly toward us, and I could finally see her eyes.

They were pale and empty, like glass, staring into me with a cold intensity that made my blood run cold. I looked away, unable to hold her gaze, and kept driving, my hands shaking on the wheel.

As we passed her, Jess grabbed my arm, her voice tight with fear. “Stop. Just stop the car.”

I didn’t want to, every instinct telling me to keep going, to leave her behind and never look back. But something in Jess’s voice—the sheer terror—made me pull over to the side of the road, my hands white-knuckling the wheel as I forced myself to breathe.

We sat there in silence, neither of us moving, both of us staring straight ahead, too afraid to look back. The air was thick, suffocating, as though the forest around us was closing in.

Finally, Jess broke the silence, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What… what does she want from us?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that we were trapped on this road, caught in some nightmare that refused to end. The woman was a constant, a silent watcher, appearing at every turn, always waiting, always watching.

As darkness fell, the shadows grew deeper, swallowing the road and everything around us. I started the car again, my hands shaking, and drove on, the headlights barely piercing the darkness.

But as we left her behind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still there, her empty eyes fixed on us, following us into the night.

 

I woke up feeling more drained than I had on any morning before. The room was dim, the curtains drawn tight against a sun that barely seemed to rise, casting only a weak, grayish light through the cracks. Jess was still asleep, her face tense even in slumber, and for a brief moment, I considered not waking her at all. Maybe she’d be better off staying in bed, far from whatever waited for us on the road.

But as much as I wanted to believe we could simply turn back, a sick, crawling feeling told me that no matter which direction we drove, we would end up on the same road—stuck in some terrible loop that we hadn’t meant to enter.

With a heavy heart, I roused Jess, and we packed up in silence. She avoided my gaze, her lips pressed into a thin, tight line. It felt like we were going to our own funeral.

After a quick, silent breakfast, we loaded up the car and set out. The world outside seemed grayer, the trees bare and twisted, as though drained of life. I felt a cold dread seep into my bones as we pulled back onto the road. The GPS flickered, blinking uncertainly for a moment before settling back onto the same route—the road that had held us captive for two days. I barely felt surprised; I knew by now there was no escape.

Jess sat beside me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Neither of us spoke as we drove through the thickening mist, the forest around us looming like a dark, shadowy tunnel, closing in on us as we went.

Hours passed, but the landscape never changed. The trees all looked the same, stretching endlessly on either side, their branches twisted and gnarled. The silence in the car was deafening, pressing in on us, as though the very air had thickened. Every now and then, I’d catch a movement out of the corner of my eye, a flicker in the trees that vanished as soon as I turned my head.

And then, around midday, we saw her again.

The old woman was standing by the roadside, her figure barely visible through the thick fog that had settled over the road. She wore the same faded dress, the same frayed scarf, but something about her was different. Her posture was more rigid, her head tilted slightly to one side, as though she were waiting for us.

I felt Jess’s grip on my arm tighten, her nails digging into my skin. “Don’t stop,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Just keep driving. Please.”

But as we drew closer, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop. It was like some invisible force was tugging at me, urging me to pull over, to get out of the car and walk toward her. My foot hovered over the brake, my hands tightening on the wheel as I struggled to resist.

“She’s just… there,” I said, more to myself than to Jess, my voice hollow. “She’s just… waiting.”

The woman raised her hand, her pale, bony fingers outstretched, beckoning us forward. Her eyes, cold and empty, fixed on me with a piercing intensity that made my skin crawl.

Jess’s voice shook. “Just go, please… don’t look at her. Just go.”

I forced myself to keep driving, my eyes locked on the road ahead, refusing to look back. I could feel her gaze on us, though—burning into the back of my head as we passed her by. It was like a weight, pressing down on me, growing heavier and heavier until I could barely breathe.

Minutes stretched into hours, and still, we drove. The road seemed endless, a looping, unchanging nightmare that refused to release us. The forest grew darker, the fog thickening until I could barely see a few feet in front of us. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners of my vision, and every time I glanced at the GPS, it showed the same unchanging coordinates.

Jess was silent, her face pale, her eyes glazed over with fear. I felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching everything from a distance, my mind slipping further and further away from reality.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to set, the car began to sputter.

I looked down, panic rising in my chest as the fuel gauge dipped suddenly, the needle plunging toward empty. My foot pressed harder on the gas, but the engine choked and sputtered, slowing down until the car rolled to a stop.

“No,” I whispered, my heart pounding. “This can’t be happening. We just filled up this morning. We can’t be out of gas.”

But the car was dead, the engine silent and unresponsive. I looked at Jess, panic clawing at my chest. She was staring out the window, her face frozen in terror.

“She’s here,” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “She’s coming.”

I looked up, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

The old woman was standing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away, her figure barely visible through the fog. Her hand was raised, beckoning us forward, her eyes fixed on me with an unblinking stare.

I felt a chill seep into my bones, freezing me in place. I wanted to move, to get out of the car and run, but I couldn’t. It was like I was rooted to the spot, trapped by her gaze.

Jess grabbed my arm, her voice shaking. “Don’t go… please, don’t go.”

But something inside me was pulling me forward, an irresistible force that I couldn’t ignore. I opened the car door, stepping out into the cold, damp air. The fog clung to my skin, thick and suffocating, as I took a step toward her.

The woman turned and began to walk into the trees, her figure disappearing into the mist. Without thinking, I followed, my legs moving of their own accord, my mind a hazy blur. Jess’s voice faded behind me, her pleas lost in the fog as I followed the woman into the darkness.

She led me deeper into the forest, her footsteps silent on the moss-covered ground. The trees closed in around us, their twisted branches reaching down like skeletal hands, brushing against my skin as I walked. I could hear whispers in the shadows, faint voices murmuring just out of reach, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

Finally, we emerged into a small clearing, and I stopped, my breath catching in my throat.

There was a house in the middle of the clearing, a dilapidated, crumbling structure that looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The windows were shattered, the walls covered in moss and ivy, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. But the woman walked up to the door, turning to look at me with that same, unblinking stare.

“Come inside,” she said, her voice a raspy whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to run, to turn back and find Jess. But something held me in place, a strange, overpowering compulsion that I couldn’t resist. I took a step forward, then another, until I was standing on the threshold, staring into the dark, empty interior.

The woman gestured for me to enter, her face obscured in the shadows. I took a deep breath, stepping over the threshold and into the darkness.

Inside, the air was thick and stale, the walls covered in dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked beneath my feet, and I could barely see anything in the dim light. I turned to look at the woman, but she was gone, vanished into the shadows.

A cold dread settled over me as I realized I was alone.

I tried to back out, but the door had disappeared, the walls around me shifting and warping until I couldn’t tell where I’d entered. Panic surged in my chest, and I stumbled through the dark, my hands brushing against cold, damp walls that seemed to close in around me.

And then I heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the darkness. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as the footsteps grew closer, closer, until they were right behind me.

I turned, my breath hitching as I saw her standing in the shadows, her empty eyes fixed on me, her face twisted into a cold, cruel smile.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty house. “You don’t belong here.”

The world around me began to blur, the walls twisting and melting until I was surrounded by darkness. The last thing I saw was her face, looming over me, her eyes cold and empty, pulling me into the shadows.

My name is Maria, i am a college student from Colorado, i had planned a road trip with my friend Jess, this is what happened on that road trip…

The road trip had been my idea. Jess had just come out of a messy breakup, and I was drowning in assignments. We needed a break—something far enough from campus to feel like an escape. So, a three-day drive through the mountains, with plans to stay at a friend’s cabin by the coast, sounded perfect. I had everything planned down to the playlists and coffee stops. We left campus at dawn, the sun barely peeking over the horizon as we drove out of town.

The first few hours were bliss. We laughed about the lousy food on campus, ranted about professors who loved to pile on work, and blasted music from our high school days. The air was fresh, the sky a clear, sharp blue, and we had no clue what was coming. Looking back, I almost envy how naive we were then.

As the afternoon dragged on, the landscape around us grew more remote. The trees became denser, towering and twisted, leaning over the road like they were trying to close in around us. Jess had dozed off in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the window, her breathing soft and even. I was getting a little sleepy myself, lulled by the rhythmic sound of tires against pavement. But then I noticed something strange.

Ahead, just off the side of the road, a figure stood motionless by the trees. As we drew closer, I realized it was an old woman. She wore a long, faded dress and a tattered scarf wrapped tightly around her head, hiding most of her face. Her posture was unnaturally stiff, her arms hanging limply at her sides as she stood perfectly still, her eyes fixed on the road.

Something about her felt… wrong. My instincts prickled, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just the sight of someone in such an isolated area, but a weird feeling had settled in my stomach.

We drove past her slowly, and I couldn’t help but glance back in the rearview mirror. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned her head—just stayed there, watching us disappear down the road.

I didn’t wake Jess. I kept driving, brushing off the encounter as some eerie coincidence. Maybe she was a local, waiting for someone, or just… lost. But as the minutes passed, I couldn’t shake the image of her still figure, standing so perfectly still, as though she’d been carved out of stone.

The road stretched on, winding through a seemingly endless forest. The trees grew closer together, casting heavy shadows across the pavement. It felt like we’d been driving for hours, but when I checked the GPS, our location barely seemed to have changed. The blue dot was creeping along at a snail’s pace, and our arrival time was now an hour later than I’d estimated. I checked the clock, frowning. Had we been driving that slowly?

Jess finally stirred beside me, stretching and blinking herself awake. She looked out the window, squinting at the dense forest around us.

""Are we almost there?"" she asked, stifling a yawn.

""Not quite,"" I said, trying to keep my voice casual. ""We’re making slower progress than I thought.""

She shrugged, turning to gaze out the window, but a look of unease settled on her face as she took in the unfamiliar landscape. The mood in the car shifted, the easygoing vibe from earlier replaced with something tense and uneasy. We sat in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the low buzz of static from the radio.

That’s when I saw her again.

I almost missed her, half-hidden by a cluster of trees just ahead. But there she was, the same old woman, standing by the roadside in that faded dress and scarf. Her posture was identical, her arms at her sides, her eyes locked on us. My heart pounded as we drove past, and this time Jess saw her too.

“Whoa… Did you see her?” Jess asked, her voice low and wary. “Isn’t that… the same woman?”

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah. I thought it was just me.”

Jess leaned back, chewing her lip. “How would she get here? There’s no town for miles.”

I didn’t have an answer, and I didn’t want to speculate. The uneasy feeling in my gut had turned into something heavier, a creeping dread that I couldn’t ignore. But as unsettling as it was, I tried to tell myself that there was some reasonable explanation. Maybe she had a car parked nearby, or a house hidden in the woods. Maybe we were just imagining things.

But as we drove on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that somehow, her gaze had followed us long after we’d passed her by.

Night began to fall, the trees casting long, dark shadows across the road. The headlights seemed to barely pierce the thickening darkness, and the silence around us grew almost oppressive. I tried turning on the radio, but only static crackled through the speakers. Even my phone had no signal, the bars stubbornly refusing to budge.

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension thickening with every passing mile. Finally, Jess spoke up, her voice barely more than a whisper.

""Do you… feel like we’re being followed?""

I glanced at her, and for a moment, I considered laughing it off. But the fear in her eyes mirrored my own, and I couldn’t deny it any longer.

""Yeah,"" I admitted, my voice barely steady. ""I feel it too.""

We kept driving, the silence between us stretching taut, both of us too scared to say anything more. As night fully fell, we passed no other cars, no houses, no signs of life—just an unbroken wall of trees pressing in on either side. The road felt endless, stretching out in front of us like it went on forever, leading us deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, after what felt like hours, a dim light appeared in the distance—a small, flickering neon sign on the roof of a rundown motel. Relief flooded through me as I pulled into the gravel lot, the headlights illuminating the faded, peeling paint and grimy windows.

Jess and I hurried inside, booking a room without a second glance at the front desk. The clerk, a wiry man with sunken eyes, barely looked up as he handed us the keys, his gaze fixed somewhere behind us, as though he’d seen something lurking just beyond the glass doors.

The room was sparse and cold, the walls yellowed and cracked. Jess locked the door behind us, checking the window to make sure it was secure. Neither of us spoke about what we’d seen on the road, but the tension was palpable, a silent understanding that we’d experienced something we couldn’t explain.

As I lay in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, I couldn’t shake the image of her—the old woman, standing by the roadside, watching us with that blank, empty stare. I felt her presence lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow that wouldn’t fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, obscured by the scarf, her gaze piercing through the darkness.

Hours passed, but sleep wouldn’t come. And in the silence of that tiny, dilapidated motel room, I could have sworn I heard footsteps outside the door. Slow, shuffling steps, moving back and forth, as though someone was pacing, waiting for something—or someone.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look. I lay frozen in bed, listening to the quiet, steady footsteps until they faded into the night, leaving me lying there, wide-eyed and trembling, waiting for dawn to come.

I woke up early, my body stiff and tense. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as sunlight crept through the thin, yellowed curtains of our motel room. I sat up, trying to push away the fog of sleeplessness and to brush off the memory of that woman standing by the road. But when I looked over at Jess, her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from a restless night, and I knew she’d felt it too.

We packed up in silence, trying to shake off the strange heaviness that lingered from the day before. After a quick stop for coffee, we got back on the road, hoping that a few hours of clear driving would lift the tension that seemed to follow us. But when Jess plugged in the GPS, a chill went down my spine. The screen blinked a few times, showing the same route from yesterday.

""Are you sure that’s the right way?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Jess frowned, tapping at the screen.

""Yeah… I mean, I think so,"" she said, glancing at the map. ""It’s weird, though. It’s like the same road… even though I swear I picked a different route today.""

I laughed nervously. “Maybe it’s just a bad signal.”

She nodded, but her eyes didn’t leave the screen. I could tell she was just as uneasy as I was. Finally, she shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Whatever. Let’s just get going.”

We pulled out of the motel lot and started driving, the road stretching out in front of us in a long, unbroken line. The forest seemed darker than yesterday, the trees pressing in on either side of us, their twisted branches reaching across the road like bony fingers. Shadows pooled under the thick canopy, and every now and then, I’d catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of my vision—just a flicker, gone before I could turn my head to see it clearly.

After an hour or so, Jess turned to me, her face pale. “Is it just me, or does it feel like… like we’re not getting anywhere?”

I checked the clock, frowning. We’d been driving for well over an hour, but the GPS showed only a few miles of progress. I double-checked the fuel gauge. We had plenty of gas, and there was no reason we should be moving this slowly.

“It’s like… the road’s stretching out,” I murmured, trying to make sense of it. But my words hung in the air, unanswered, because how do you explain something like that?

The radio crackled with static, and I turned it off, unwilling to break the tense silence that had settled between us. We drove on, mile after mile, the road twisting through the endless forest like a coiled snake. The sun had barely moved in the sky, stuck in that eerie, pre-noon brightness, casting long shadows that seemed to follow us.

This time, though, her posture was different—more alert, more… attentive. She stood with one hand raised, palm out, as though signaling us to stop.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt Jess’s hand grip my arm, her fingers cold and tight. “No… No way,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How is she here? She can’t… she can’t be here.”

I forced myself to keep driving, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the rearview mirror. The woman’s face was still obscured by the scarf, but I could feel her eyes on us, following us even as we passed her by. The skin on the back of my neck prickled, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as we left her behind.

Neither of us spoke for a long time after that. Jess sat with her knees drawn up, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as though trying to ward off a chill. I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to look back, afraid of what I might see.

After another hour of silent driving, the road finally seemed to open up a bit. I felt a strange sense of relief, like we’d escaped something that had been closing in on us. We hadn’t seen any signs of life—not a single car, house, or gas station—since leaving the motel, but finally, a small, weathered sign appeared on the side of the road: “Gas, 10 miles.”

I didn’t want to, every instinct telling me to keep going, to leave her behind and never look back. But something in Jess’s voice—the sheer terror—made me pull over to the side of the road, my hands white-knuckling the wheel as I forced myself to breathe.

We sat there in silence, neither of us moving, both of us staring straight ahead, too afraid to look back. The air was thick, suffocating, as though the forest around us was closing in.

But as we drew closer, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop. It was like some invisible force was tugging at me, urging me to pull over, to get out of the car and walk toward her. My foot hovered over the brake, my hands tightening on the wheel as I struggled to resist.

“She’s just… there,” I said, more to myself than to Jess, my voice hollow. “She’s just… waiting.”

The woman raised her hand, her pale, bony fingers outstretched, beckoning us forward. Her eyes, cold and empty, fixed on me with a piercing intensity that made my skin crawl.

Jess’s voice shook. “Just go, please… don’t look at her. Just go.”

I forced myself to keep driving, my eyes locked on the road ahead, refusing to look back. I could feel her gaze on us, though—burning into the back of my head as we passed her by. It was like a weight, pressing down on me, growing heavier and heavier until I could barely breathe.

Minutes stretched into hours, and still, we drove. The road seemed endless, a looping, unchanging nightmare that refused to release us. The forest grew darker, the fog thickening until I could barely see a few feet in front of us. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners of my vision, and every time I glanced at the GPS, it showed the same unchanging coordinates.

Jess was silent, her face pale, her eyes glazed over with fear. I felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching everything from a distance, my mind slipping further and further away from reality.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to set, the car began to sputter.

I looked down, panic rising in my chest as the fuel gauge dipped suddenly, the needle plunging toward empty. My foot pressed harder on the gas, but the engine choked and sputtered, slowing down until the car rolled to a stop.

“No,” I whispered, my heart pounding. “This can’t be happening. We just filled up this morning. We can’t be out of gas.”

But the car was dead, the engine silent and unresponsive. I looked at Jess, panic clawing at my chest. She was staring out the window, her face frozen in terror.

“She’s here,” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “She’s coming.”

I looked up, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

The old woman was standing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away, her figure barely visible through the fog. Her hand was raised, beckoning us forward, her eyes fixed on me with an unblinking stare.

I felt a chill seep into my bones, freezing me in place. I wanted to move, to get out of the car and run, but I couldn’t. It was like I was rooted to the spot, trapped by her gaze.

Jess grabbed my arm, her voice shaking. “Don’t go… please, don’t go.”

But something inside me was pulling me forward, an irresistible force that I couldn’t ignore. I opened the car door, stepping out into the cold, damp air. The fog clung to my skin, thick and suffocating, as I took a step toward her.

The woman turned and began to walk into the trees, her figure disappearing into the mist. Without thinking, I followed, my legs moving of their own accord, my mind a hazy blur. Jess’s voice faded behind me, her pleas lost in the fog as I followed the woman into the darkness.

She led me deeper into the forest, her footsteps silent on the moss-covered ground. The trees closed in around us, their twisted branches reaching down like skeletal hands, brushing against my skin as I walked. I could hear whispers in the shadows, faint voices murmuring just out of reach, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

Finally, we emerged into a small clearing, and I stopped, my breath catching in my throat.

There was a house in the middle of the clearing, a dilapidated, crumbling structure that looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The windows were shattered, the walls covered in moss and ivy, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. But the woman walked up to the door, turning to look at me with that same, unblinking stare.

“Come inside,” she said, her voice a raspy whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to run, to turn back and find Jess. But something held me in place, a strange, overpowering compulsion that I couldn’t resist. I took a step forward, then another, until I was standing on the threshold, staring into the dark, empty interior.

The woman gestured for me to enter, her face obscured in the shadows. I took a deep breath, stepping over the threshold and into the darkness.

Inside, the air was thick and stale, the walls covered in dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked beneath my feet, and I could barely see anything in the dim light. I turned to look at the woman, but she was gone, vanished into the shadows.

A cold dread settled over me as I realized I was alone.

I tried to back out, but the door had disappeared, the walls around me shifting and warping until I couldn’t tell where I’d entered. Panic surged in my chest, and I stumbled through the dark, my hands brushing against cold, damp walls that seemed to close in around me.

And then I heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the darkness. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as the footsteps grew closer, closer, until they were right behind me.

I turned, my breath hitching as I saw her standing in the shadows, her empty eyes fixed on me, her face twisted into a cold, cruel smile.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty house. “You don’t belong here.”

The world around me began to blur, the walls twisting and melting until I was surrounded by darkness. The last thing I saw was her face, looming over me, her eyes cold and empty, pulling me into the shadows.

And then, everything went black.

The first thing I felt was the warmth of sunlight filtering through my window. My eyes fluttered open, and for a few seconds, I just lay there, staring at the familiar ceiling of my bedroom. The events of the last few days felt like a distant, feverish memory, and a thick fog of confusion settled over me as I tried to piece together what had happened.

Had it all been… a dream?

I sat up slowly, the edges of my mind still hazy, haunted by images of twisted trees, the endless road, and the woman’s piercing, empty gaze. My heart pounded as I remembered her whisper: *“You don’t belong here.”* My breath caught, and I reached up, feeling the sweat beaded on my forehead, my skin cold to the touch.

Looking around, everything seemed normal—my clothes piled on the chair, my bag tossed on the floor, my phone on the nightstand. The digital clock blinked 8:12 AM in neon green. Nothing felt out of place. And yet, a strange heaviness lingered, a weight pressing down on my chest, like the dream hadn’t fully let go of me.

I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. The idea of calling Jess popped into my mind, but something about it filled me with a sense of dread. What if she’d had the same dream? What if the whole thing was some twisted premonition, a warning?

Before I could talk myself out of it, I picked up my phone and called her. After a few rings, Jess answered, her voice groggy but familiar.

“Hello?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

“Jess, it’s me,” I said, my voice sounding strange in my own ears. “Did… did you sleep okay?”

There was a pause on the other end, and I could almost feel her hesitation. “Yeah… I mean, not really,” she admitted. “I had this… this nightmare. It was so real, like I was actually there.”

My heart skipped a beat. “What… what happened in the nightmare?”

Jess took a shaky breath. “We were on this road trip. And we kept seeing this old woman by the road… over and over again. No matter how far we drove, we couldn’t get away from her. And then, on the last day, she invited us inside her house, and…” Her voice trailed off, trembling. “And it was like we were trapped, like we’d never get out.”

My stomach twisted, and I felt a surge of cold dread. “Jess, I… I had the same dream. Exactly the same.”

The silence on the other end of the line felt heavy, weighted with unspoken fear. “This can’t just be a coincidence, can it?” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “It felt so real, like it was some kind of… warning.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Maybe… maybe it was. I don’t know, Jess. But we were supposed to go on that trip today.”

“No way.” Jess’s voice was suddenly firm, edged with panic. “I’m not going. Not after that. There’s something wrong about this, something… dangerous.”

A chill ran down my spine. Part of me wanted to believe it had all just been a strange, shared nightmare, some bizarre trick of our minds. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was more than that, that we’d somehow glimpsed a dark future that had been waiting for us.

I glanced at my packed bags, my heart pounding. It felt like they didn’t belong in my room anymore, like they were somehow tainted by the nightmare. I shivered, looking away, not wanting to touch them.

“I think you’re right,” I said, my voice unsteady. “Maybe… maybe we’re not supposed to go on this trip.”

We sat in silence for a moment, both of us caught in the same silent understanding. The dream had felt like a warning, and neither of us wanted to find out what might happen if we ignored it. The road was calling to us, but it was a call we’d both decided not to answer.

Finally, Jess spoke, her voice low and filled with relief. “Thank you. I don’t think I could go after that… even if I wanted to.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah… me neither.”

We said our goodbyes and hung up, and I let the phone fall from my hand, my fingers numb. The room felt quiet, almost too quiet, and I shivered, feeling that same, lingering unease creeping over me. Even though I was awake, it felt like the dream hadn’t fully let go, like some part of it was still lurking in the corners of my mind, waiting.

And as I lay back down, staring at the ceiling, I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere out there, the woman was waiting, her cold, empty eyes fixed on the road, watching for us.

My name is Maria, i am a college student from Colorado, i had planned a road trip with my friend Jess, this is what happened on that road trip…

The road trip had been my idea. Jess had just come out of a messy breakup, and I was drowning in assignments. We needed a break—something far enough from campus to feel like an escape. So, a three-day drive through the mountains, with plans to stay at a friend’s cabin by the coast, sounded perfect. I had everything planned down to the playlists and coffee stops. We left campus at dawn, the sun barely peeking over the horizon as we drove out of town.

The first few hours were bliss. We laughed about the lousy food on campus, ranted about professors who loved to pile on work, and blasted music from our high school days. The air was fresh, the sky a clear, sharp blue, and we had no clue what was coming. Looking back, I almost envy how naive we were then.

As the afternoon dragged on, the landscape around us grew more remote. The trees became denser, towering and twisted, leaning over the road like they were trying to close in around us. Jess had dozed off in the passenger seat, her face pressed against the window, her breathing soft and even. I was getting a little sleepy myself, lulled by the rhythmic sound of tires against pavement. But then I noticed something strange.

Ahead, just off the side of the road, a figure stood motionless by the trees. As we drew closer, I realized it was an old woman. She wore a long, faded dress and a tattered scarf wrapped tightly around her head, hiding most of her face. Her posture was unnaturally stiff, her arms hanging limply at her sides as she stood perfectly still, her eyes fixed on the road.

Something about her felt… wrong. My instincts prickled, the hair on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to shake it off, telling myself it was just the sight of someone in such an isolated area, but a weird feeling had settled in my stomach.

We drove past her slowly, and I couldn’t help but glance back in the rearview mirror. She hadn’t moved, hadn’t turned her head—just stayed there, watching us disappear down the road.

I didn’t wake Jess. I kept driving, brushing off the encounter as some eerie coincidence. Maybe she was a local, waiting for someone, or just… lost. But as the minutes passed, I couldn’t shake the image of her still figure, standing so perfectly still, as though she’d been carved out of stone.

The road stretched on, winding through a seemingly endless forest. The trees grew closer together, casting heavy shadows across the pavement. It felt like we’d been driving for hours, but when I checked the GPS, our location barely seemed to have changed. The blue dot was creeping along at a snail’s pace, and our arrival time was now an hour later than I’d estimated. I checked the clock, frowning. Had we been driving that slowly?

Jess finally stirred beside me, stretching and blinking herself awake. She looked out the window, squinting at the dense forest around us.

""Are we almost there?"" she asked, stifling a yawn.

""Not quite,"" I said, trying to keep my voice casual. ""We’re making slower progress than I thought.""

She shrugged, turning to gaze out the window, but a look of unease settled on her face as she took in the unfamiliar landscape. The mood in the car shifted, the easygoing vibe from earlier replaced with something tense and uneasy. We sat in silence for a while, the only sound the hum of the engine and the low buzz of static from the radio.

That’s when I saw her again.

I almost missed her, half-hidden by a cluster of trees just ahead. But there she was, the same old woman, standing by the roadside in that faded dress and scarf. Her posture was identical, her arms at her sides, her eyes locked on us. My heart pounded as we drove past, and this time Jess saw her too.

“Whoa… Did you see her?” Jess asked, her voice low and wary. “Isn’t that… the same woman?”

I nodded, gripping the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah. I thought it was just me.”

Jess leaned back, chewing her lip. “How would she get here? There’s no town for miles.”

I didn’t have an answer, and I didn’t want to speculate. The uneasy feeling in my gut had turned into something heavier, a creeping dread that I couldn’t ignore. But as unsettling as it was, I tried to tell myself that there was some reasonable explanation. Maybe she had a car parked nearby, or a house hidden in the woods. Maybe we were just imagining things.

But as we drove on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that somehow, her gaze had followed us long after we’d passed her by.

Night began to fall, the trees casting long, dark shadows across the road. The headlights seemed to barely pierce the thickening darkness, and the silence around us grew almost oppressive. I tried turning on the radio, but only static crackled through the speakers. Even my phone had no signal, the bars stubbornly refusing to budge.

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension thickening with every passing mile. Finally, Jess spoke up, her voice barely more than a whisper.

""Do you… feel like we’re being followed?""

I glanced at her, and for a moment, I considered laughing it off. But the fear in her eyes mirrored my own, and I couldn’t deny it any longer.

""Yeah,"" I admitted, my voice barely steady. ""I feel it too.""

We kept driving, the silence between us stretching taut, both of us too scared to say anything more. As night fully fell, we passed no other cars, no houses, no signs of life—just an unbroken wall of trees pressing in on either side. The road felt endless, stretching out in front of us like it went on forever, leading us deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, after what felt like hours, a dim light appeared in the distance—a small, flickering neon sign on the roof of a rundown motel. Relief flooded through me as I pulled into the gravel lot, the headlights illuminating the faded, peeling paint and grimy windows.

Jess and I hurried inside, booking a room without a second glance at the front desk. The clerk, a wiry man with sunken eyes, barely looked up as he handed us the keys, his gaze fixed somewhere behind us, as though he’d seen something lurking just beyond the glass doors.

The room was sparse and cold, the walls yellowed and cracked. Jess locked the door behind us, checking the window to make sure it was secure. Neither of us spoke about what we’d seen on the road, but the tension was palpable, a silent understanding that we’d experienced something we couldn’t explain.

As I lay in bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, I couldn’t shake the image of her—the old woman, standing by the roadside, watching us with that blank, empty stare. I felt her presence lingering in the back of my mind, like a shadow that wouldn’t fade. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, obscured by the scarf, her gaze piercing through the darkness.

Hours passed, but sleep wouldn’t come. And in the silence of that tiny, dilapidated motel room, I could have sworn I heard footsteps outside the door. Slow, shuffling steps, moving back and forth, as though someone was pacing, waiting for something—or someone.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare look. I lay frozen in bed, listening to the quiet, steady footsteps until they faded into the night, leaving me lying there, wide-eyed and trembling, waiting for dawn to come.

I woke up early, my body stiff and tense. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched, even as sunlight crept through the thin, yellowed curtains of our motel room. I sat up, trying to push away the fog of sleeplessness and to brush off the memory of that woman standing by the road. But when I looked over at Jess, her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed from a restless night, and I knew she’d felt it too.

We packed up in silence, trying to shake off the strange heaviness that lingered from the day before. After a quick stop for coffee, we got back on the road, hoping that a few hours of clear driving would lift the tension that seemed to follow us. But when Jess plugged in the GPS, a chill went down my spine. The screen blinked a few times, showing the same route from yesterday.

""Are you sure that’s the right way?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Jess frowned, tapping at the screen.

""Yeah… I mean, I think so,"" she said, glancing at the map. ""It’s weird, though. It’s like the same road… even though I swear I picked a different route today.""

I laughed nervously. “Maybe it’s just a bad signal.”

She nodded, but her eyes didn’t leave the screen. I could tell she was just as uneasy as I was. Finally, she shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Whatever. Let’s just get going.”

We pulled out of the motel lot and started driving, the road stretching out in front of us in a long, unbroken line. The forest seemed darker than yesterday, the trees pressing in on either side of us, their twisted branches reaching across the road like bony fingers. Shadows pooled under the thick canopy, and every now and then, I’d catch a glimpse of something moving at the edge of my vision—just a flicker, gone before I could turn my head to see it clearly.

After an hour or so, Jess turned to me, her face pale. “Is it just me, or does it feel like… like we’re not getting anywhere?”

I checked the clock, frowning. We’d been driving for well over an hour, but the GPS showed only a few miles of progress. I double-checked the fuel gauge. We had plenty of gas, and there was no reason we should be moving this slowly.

“It’s like… the road’s stretching out,” I murmured, trying to make sense of it. But my words hung in the air, unanswered, because how do you explain something like that?

The radio crackled with static, and I turned it off, unwilling to break the tense silence that had settled between us. We drove on, mile after mile, the road twisting through the endless forest like a coiled snake. The sun had barely moved in the sky, stuck in that eerie, pre-noon brightness, casting long shadows that seemed to follow us.

And then we saw her again.

The old woman stood by the side of the road, in the exact same spot as yesterday. She was dressed the same way, her faded dress and frayed scarf stirring in the faint breeze. This time, though, her posture was different—more alert, more… attentive. She stood with one hand raised, palm out, as though signaling us to stop.

My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt Jess’s hand grip my arm, her fingers cold and tight. “No… No way,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “How is she here? She can’t… she can’t be here.”

I forced myself to keep driving, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the rearview mirror. The woman’s face was still obscured by the scarf, but I could feel her eyes on us, following us even as we passed her by. The skin on the back of my neck prickled, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as we left her behind.

Neither of us spoke for a long time after that. Jess sat with her knees drawn up, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as though trying to ward off a chill. I kept my eyes on the road, refusing to look back, afraid of what I might see.

After another hour of silent driving, the road finally seemed to open up a bit. I felt a strange sense of relief, like we’d escaped something that had been closing in on us. We hadn’t seen any signs of life—not a single car, house, or gas station—since leaving the motel, but finally, a small, weathered sign appeared on the side of the road: “Gas, 10 miles.”

I sped up, eager to reach some sign of civilization, even if it was just a rundown gas station in the middle of nowhere.

When we finally reached it, I pulled in, the tires crunching on the gravel as I parked by one of the ancient-looking pumps. The place was eerily quiet, and a sense of unease washed over me as I climbed out of the car. I glanced around, but the station seemed deserted. The windows were covered in grime, and the only sound was the faint, shivering wind rustling through the trees.

Jess stayed in the car, staring at the dashboard as though afraid to look up. I could feel her anxiety from where I stood, but I didn’t blame her. I was barely keeping it together myself.

As I filled the tank, a figure appeared in the doorway of the gas station. I jumped, almost spilling gas on the ground. It was a man, his face obscured by the shadow of his hat, his clothes worn and stained. He watched me for a moment, then stepped out onto the porch, his movements slow and deliberate.

“Headed somewhere?” he asked, his voice rough and low, barely audible over the wind.

I nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah… just passing through.”

He tilted his head, his eyes narrowing slightly as he looked me over. “Be careful out there. Roads don’t always lead where you think they do.”

I felt a chill at his words, but I didn’t know how to respond. He watched me in silence for a moment, then turned and disappeared back into the shadows of the gas station. I hurried back to the car, my heart pounding as I slid into the driver’s seat.

Jess looked at me, her eyes wide. “Did he… did he say anything to you?”

I shook my head, lying without really knowing why. “Nothing important. Let’s just go.”

We drove in silence, both of us on edge, the tension between us thick and oppressive. The road stretched out in front of us, twisting and turning through the endless forest. Every mile felt like a lifetime, and the shadows around us grew darker, thicker, as though something was closing in.

I don’t know how long we drove—time felt meaningless, slipping away in the endless monotony of the road. But as evening began to fall, the light fading into a murky twilight, I saw something ahead that made my heart stop.

The old woman.

She was standing in the same spot as before, her back straight, her gaze fixed on us. Her hand was raised again, palm out, as though warning us to stop. This time, though, her face was turned directly toward us, and I could finally see her eyes.

They were pale and empty, like glass, staring into me with a cold intensity that made my blood run cold. I looked away, unable to hold her gaze, and kept driving, my hands shaking on the wheel.

As we passed her, Jess grabbed my arm, her voice tight with fear. “Stop. Just stop the car.”

I didn’t want to, every instinct telling me to keep going, to leave her behind and never look back. But something in Jess’s voice—the sheer terror—made me pull over to the side of the road, my hands white-knuckling the wheel as I forced myself to breathe.

We sat there in silence, neither of us moving, both of us staring straight ahead, too afraid to look back. The air was thick, suffocating, as though the forest around us was closing in.

Finally, Jess broke the silence, her voice barely more than a whisper. “What… what does she want from us?”

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that we were trapped on this road, caught in some nightmare that refused to end. The woman was a constant, a silent watcher, appearing at every turn, always waiting, always watching.

As darkness fell, the shadows grew deeper, swallowing the road and everything around us. I started the car again, my hands shaking, and drove on, the headlights barely piercing the darkness.

But as we left her behind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still there, her empty eyes fixed on us, following us into the night.

 

I woke up feeling more drained than I had on any morning before. The room was dim, the curtains drawn tight against a sun that barely seemed to rise, casting only a weak, grayish light through the cracks. Jess was still asleep, her face tense even in slumber, and for a brief moment, I considered not waking her at all. Maybe she’d be better off staying in bed, far from whatever waited for us on the road.

But as much as I wanted to believe we could simply turn back, a sick, crawling feeling told me that no matter which direction we drove, we would end up on the same road—stuck in some terrible loop that we hadn’t meant to enter.

With a heavy heart, I roused Jess, and we packed up in silence. She avoided my gaze, her lips pressed into a thin, tight line. It felt like we were going to our own funeral.

After a quick, silent breakfast, we loaded up the car and set out. The world outside seemed grayer, the trees bare and twisted, as though drained of life. I felt a cold dread seep into my bones as we pulled back onto the road. The GPS flickered, blinking uncertainly for a moment before settling back onto the same route—the road that had held us captive for two days. I barely felt surprised; I knew by now there was no escape.

Jess sat beside me, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Neither of us spoke as we drove through the thickening mist, the forest around us looming like a dark, shadowy tunnel, closing in on us as we went.

Hours passed, but the landscape never changed. The trees all looked the same, stretching endlessly on either side, their branches twisted and gnarled. The silence in the car was deafening, pressing in on us, as though the very air had thickened. Every now and then, I’d catch a movement out of the corner of my eye, a flicker in the trees that vanished as soon as I turned my head.

And then, around midday, we saw her again.

The old woman was standing by the roadside, her figure barely visible through the thick fog that had settled over the road. She wore the same faded dress, the same frayed scarf, but something about her was different. Her posture was more rigid, her head tilted slightly to one side, as though she were waiting for us.

I felt Jess’s grip on my arm tighten, her nails digging into my skin. “Don’t stop,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Just keep driving. Please.”

But as we drew closer, I felt an overwhelming urge to stop. It was like some invisible force was tugging at me, urging me to pull over, to get out of the car and walk toward her. My foot hovered over the brake, my hands tightening on the wheel as I struggled to resist.

“She’s just… there,” I said, more to myself than to Jess, my voice hollow. “She’s just… waiting.”

The woman raised her hand, her pale, bony fingers outstretched, beckoning us forward. Her eyes, cold and empty, fixed on me with a piercing intensity that made my skin crawl.

Jess’s voice shook. “Just go, please… don’t look at her. Just go.”

I forced myself to keep driving, my eyes locked on the road ahead, refusing to look back. I could feel her gaze on us, though—burning into the back of my head as we passed her by. It was like a weight, pressing down on me, growing heavier and heavier until I could barely breathe.

Minutes stretched into hours, and still, we drove. The road seemed endless, a looping, unchanging nightmare that refused to release us. The forest grew darker, the fog thickening until I could barely see a few feet in front of us. Shadows seemed to dance in the corners of my vision, and every time I glanced at the GPS, it showed the same unchanging coordinates.

Jess was silent, her face pale, her eyes glazed over with fear. I felt a strange sense of detachment, like I was watching everything from a distance, my mind slipping further and further away from reality.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to set, the car began to sputter.

I looked down, panic rising in my chest as the fuel gauge dipped suddenly, the needle plunging toward empty. My foot pressed harder on the gas, but the engine choked and sputtered, slowing down until the car rolled to a stop.

“No,” I whispered, my heart pounding. “This can’t be happening. We just filled up this morning. We can’t be out of gas.”

But the car was dead, the engine silent and unresponsive. I looked at Jess, panic clawing at my chest. She was staring out the window, her face frozen in terror.

“She’s here,” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “She’s coming.”

I looked up, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

The old woman was standing in the middle of the road, just a few feet away, her figure barely visible through the fog. Her hand was raised, beckoning us forward, her eyes fixed on me with an unblinking stare.

I felt a chill seep into my bones, freezing me in place. I wanted to move, to get out of the car and run, but I couldn’t. It was like I was rooted to the spot, trapped by her gaze.

Jess grabbed my arm, her voice shaking. “Don’t go… please, don’t go.”

But something inside me was pulling me forward, an irresistible force that I couldn’t ignore. I opened the car door, stepping out into the cold, damp air. The fog clung to my skin, thick and suffocating, as I took a step toward her.

The woman turned and began to walk into the trees, her figure disappearing into the mist. Without thinking, I followed, my legs moving of their own accord, my mind a hazy blur. Jess’s voice faded behind me, her pleas lost in the fog as I followed the woman into the darkness.

She led me deeper into the forest, her footsteps silent on the moss-covered ground. The trees closed in around us, their twisted branches reaching down like skeletal hands, brushing against my skin as I walked. I could hear whispers in the shadows, faint voices murmuring just out of reach, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.

Finally, we emerged into a small clearing, and I stopped, my breath catching in my throat.

There was a house in the middle of the clearing, a dilapidated, crumbling structure that looked like it had been abandoned for decades. The windows were shattered, the walls covered in moss and ivy, and the door hung crookedly on its hinges. But the woman walked up to the door, turning to look at me with that same, unblinking stare.

“Come inside,” she said, her voice a raspy whisper that sent a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, every instinct screaming at me to run, to turn back and find Jess. But something held me in place, a strange, overpowering compulsion that I couldn’t resist. I took a step forward, then another, until I was standing on the threshold, staring into the dark, empty interior.

The woman gestured for me to enter, her face obscured in the shadows. I took a deep breath, stepping over the threshold and into the darkness.

Inside, the air was thick and stale, the walls covered in dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked beneath my feet, and I could barely see anything in the dim light. I turned to look at the woman, but she was gone, vanished into the shadows.

A cold dread settled over me as I realized I was alone.

I tried to back out, but the door had disappeared, the walls around me shifting and warping until I couldn’t tell where I’d entered. Panic surged in my chest, and I stumbled through the dark, my hands brushing against cold, damp walls that seemed to close in around me.

And then I heard it—the faint sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the darkness. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as the footsteps grew closer, closer, until they were right behind me.

I turned, my breath hitching as I saw her standing in the shadows, her empty eyes fixed on me, her face twisted into a cold, cruel smile.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty house. “You don’t belong here.”

The world around me began to blur, the walls twisting and melting until I was surrounded by darkness. The last thing I saw was her face, looming over me, her eyes cold and empty, pulling me into the shadows.

And then, everything went black.

The first thing I felt was the warmth of sunlight filtering through my window. My eyes fluttered open, and for a few seconds, I just lay there, staring at the familiar ceiling of my bedroom. The events of the last few days felt like a distant, feverish memory, and a thick fog of confusion settled over me as I tried to piece together what had happened.

Had it all been… a dream?

I sat up slowly, the edges of my mind still hazy, haunted by images of twisted trees, the endless road, and the woman’s piercing, empty gaze. My heart pounded as I remembered her whisper: *“You don’t belong here.”* My breath caught, and I reached up, feeling the sweat beaded on my forehead, my skin cold to the touch.

Looking around, everything seemed normal—my clothes piled on the chair, my bag tossed on the floor, my phone on the nightstand. The digital clock blinked 8:12 AM in neon green. Nothing felt out of place. And yet, a strange heaviness lingered, a weight pressing down on my chest, like the dream hadn’t fully let go of me.

I took a deep breath, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. The idea of calling Jess popped into my mind, but something about it filled me with a sense of dread. What if she’d had the same dream? What if the whole thing was some twisted premonition, a warning?

Before I could talk myself out of it, I picked up my phone and called her. After a few rings, Jess answered, her voice groggy but familiar.

“Hello?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

“Jess, it’s me,” I said, my voice sounding strange in my own ears. “Did… did you sleep okay?”

There was a pause on the other end, and I could almost feel her hesitation. “Yeah… I mean, not really,” she admitted. “I had this… this nightmare. It was so real, like I was actually there.”

My heart skipped a beat. “What… what happened in the nightmare?”

Jess took a shaky breath. “We were on this road trip. And we kept seeing this old woman by the road… over and over again. No matter how far we drove, we couldn’t get away from her. And then, on the last day, she invited us inside her house, and…” Her voice trailed off, trembling. “And it was like we were trapped, like we’d never get out.”

My stomach twisted, and I felt a surge of cold dread. “Jess, I… I had the same dream. Exactly the same.”

The silence on the other end of the line felt heavy, weighted with unspoken fear. “This can’t just be a coincidence, can it?” Jess whispered, her voice barely audible. “It felt so real, like it was some kind of… warning.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Maybe… maybe it was. I don’t know, Jess. But we were supposed to go on that trip today.”

“No way.” Jess’s voice was suddenly firm, edged with panic. “I’m not going. Not after that. There’s something wrong about this, something… dangerous.”

A chill ran down my spine. Part of me wanted to believe it had all just been a strange, shared nightmare, some bizarre trick of our minds. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was more than that, that we’d somehow glimpsed a dark future that had been waiting for us.

I glanced at my packed bags, my heart pounding. It felt like they didn’t belong in my room anymore, like they were somehow tainted by the nightmare. I shivered, looking away, not wanting to touch them.

“I think you’re right,” I said, my voice unsteady. “Maybe… maybe we’re not supposed to go on this trip.”

We sat in silence for a moment, both of us caught in the same silent understanding. The dream had felt like a warning, and neither of us wanted to find out what might happen if we ignored it. The road was calling to us, but it was a call we’d both decided not to answer.

Finally, Jess spoke, her voice low and filled with relief. “Thank you. I don’t think I could go after that… even if I wanted to.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah… me neither.”

We said our goodbyes and hung up, and I let the phone fall from my hand, my fingers numb. The room felt quiet, almost too quiet, and I shivered, feeling that same, lingering unease creeping over me. Even though I was awake, it felt like the dream hadn’t fully let go, like some part of it was still lurking in the corners of my mind, waiting.

And as I lay back down, staring at the ceiling, I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere out there, the woman was waiting, her cold, empty eyes fixed on the road, watching for us.

I think it started when I was a kid. I'm Cuban so I grew up drinking coffee, but once I became a teenager I realized coffee/caffeine helped me focus and do well in school. Sugar was another thing, I ate a LOT of sugar as a kid because it made me happy. I don't eat quite as much sugar now, but it's still a habit.

Now I'm 21, and if I don't have coffee by 11am I get a headache and am very grumpy and foggy. However, caffeine doesn't react with me normally. If I have a coffee, I feel great and focused for about an hour, maybe two if I'm lucky, and then I crash and start getting sleepy and foggy. 

I want to stop this habit (without cutting out coffee/sugar altogether) and find a different way to regulate my ADHD and emotions. What has worked for you? ",1,1731689355.0,ADHD,4,1.0,False

I am moving back to the twin cities area after leaving for a bit t for school.

I am open to suburbs, too, if anyone has suggestions that at the very least meet the accessibility and public transit reqs. I am likely going to be working at Gillette Children’s, Children’s (likely St. Paul loc), Fairview (East/West bank, or Southdale, potentially Masonic Children’s.)

Ideas and recommendations on buildings, or even management companies to look at (or stay away from) appreciated. 

If this helps give an idea of what I would like to do neighborhood wise, I love farmer’s markets, coffee shops, and cute hang out places.

I know my way around the typical people that frequent public transit, I lived on the same block as the Chicago and 14th St bus stop for 4 years.

Charlotte I love your channel and when I re-read this back to myself to check for typo's I read it in your voice in my head :) Also sorry if there are still typos, I'm not perfect, lol

BACKSTORY: I met my childhood BFF- we'll call her Cassie- when we were 10 years old and I had just moved to her town/school. She was one of the first people in school to befriend me and the friendship was pretty rock solid all throughout middle school and high school. We both helped each other out and leaned on one another through tough times, like her dad passing away and me having very emotionally abusive and toxic parents and siblings (a story for another day perhaps). 

We ended up going to different colleges, but they were in the same city, so we were still able to see one another fairly regularly. In college, Cassie was roommates with another one of our close school friends who also attended college with her- we'll call her Anna. There were times when I would meet up with Anna without Cassie because she was busy or something and Anna informed me many times how Cassie was ""changing"" and wasn't the friend that we both loved and remembered her being. It seems Cassie had met a new friend in college who we'll call Karen because why the hell not. According to Anna, Karen was one of the biggest B-words she had ever met in her life and she was rubbing off on Cassie big time. Because of Karen's influence, Cassie began constantly judging Anna for everything she did, being extremely rude, and down right mean. It became unbearable for Anna to be in the dorm with Cassie if Karen was there. The biggest example that I can remember was Cassie telling Anna what she could and could not eat because Anna ""really needed to watch her weight."" Anna was not and has never been overweight. Cassie's reasoning for the comment, ""Well, we've all seen your mom, Anna. You better start getting on top of your weight now."" When Anna told me Cassie said this, I was shocked. Never in a thousand years would I have ever imagined Cassie saying something so horrible to our friend. When I confronted Cassie, her excuse, ""Well, I was just repeating what Karen said."" Karen had never even met Anna's mom and even if she did, Cassie should have defended Anna rather than agreeing with Karen. I scolded Cassie and she tried to double down but eventually agreed to apologize to Anna, which Anna said she did. 

As college went on, however, Anna drifted from Cassie, who only got closer to Karen. After college, Anna moved back to our hometown and admittedly, I lost touch with her, but I do enjoy seeing her happy family photos that she posts on FB :) 

Cassie and I stayed in our college city after we graduated and remained friends, but since Karen's arrival in her life, it was honestly a struggle for me to keep close to Cassie. I had met Karen several times throughout the years and she was exactly as horrible as Anna always described. But still, Cassie and I maintained that type of friendship where we were always there for each other no matter what- birthdays, break ups, deaths in the families, staying on each other's couches in between apartment moves, whatever. 

THE WEDDING: When Cassie got engaged when we were 25, I was thrilled for her. Since we were 10, we had always talked about being each other's maid-of-honor. We'd even talked about it recently when things were getting serious with her fiance- who we'll call Graham. To my surprise, when Cassie announced her bridal party, I wasn't in it at all. Karen was her maid-of-honor and the only other bridesmaid is Cassie's soon-to-be step daughter, who was 10-11ish. I was hurt, but didn't say anything because it's her wedding and she can have whoever she wants in her bridal party. 

Since I was in the midst of starting up my photography business at the time, I offered to do the photos for Cassie's wedding instead at a very discounted rate, only $200. Cassie says thank you, but that her uncle who is a professional photographer offered to do them for free. I say okay and move on, planning to just be a guest.

Karen was the one who planned and hosted Cassie's engagement party and bridal shower and surprise, surprise she didn't invite me to either one. It wasn't until after the parties that Cassie texted me and asked where I had been. I was very confused both times, as I didn't know a thing about these parties. She seemed disappointed that I wasn't there, yet wasn't ever angry with Karen for not inviting me. She did insist to Karen, however, that she had to invite me to the bachelorette party. I assured Cassie that I wouldn't miss it. Just tell me the day and time and I would be there. 

Surprise, surprise, I was excluded again. On the night of the bachelorette party, I was working (bartending) when Karen texted me, said the party was happening right now, and that Cassie wanted me there. It was a busy Saturday night and I was scheduled to close, there was no way I could just up and leave and Karen undoubtedly knew this, as she knew that I was a bartender. I still reiterated this to her and she called me a ""loser bitch"" for ""bailing"" on Cassie when I promised to be there. I said I would have been had she not waited to invite me until the middle of the event. When Cassie later texted me asking where I was, I sent her the screenshots of my conversation with Karen, proving that once again she didn't invite me. Cassie never responded.

The following weekend was the wedding. The reception was going to be at Cassie and Graham's house in the backyard, and catered by friends and family potluck style since they were on a tight budget. I took Friday off from work and spent the whole day helping to cook food and set up decorations for the reception. Despite her promising to be there, Karen was no where to be found the entire day, with no explanation. I even filled in for her during the rehearsal. Not gonna lie, I was really hoping that Cassie would drop Karen as MOH and tag me in, believe me I was ready for it. But sadly, that did not happen.

Before leaving that night, Cassie asked me for a favor. She said that she and her future stepdaughter- we'll call Grace- were going to go to Karen's house in the morning to do their nails, makeup, and hair and asked if I would come and take photos of it, since her uncle was not comfortable taking pictures of that kind of situation. Weird I thought, but okay. I arrive at Karen's house in the morning before Cassie, and Karen slams the door on my face and refuses to let me in, even knowing full well why I was there. Cassie and Grace arrive a few minutes later and I follow them in, I was not shy about why I was sitting on the porch instead of inside. Cassie had no comment on Karen's rudeness. Karen offers coffee, water, or juice, as well as muffins and bagels to Cassie and Grace and openly states that there is none for me (there was plenty, they could have shared). Again, Cassie says nothing. Karen wouldn't even let me pull up a chair, I had to sit on the floor. Even Grace who was like 11, commented on how Karen was rude and mean, yet Cassie said nothing.

I needed to leave at some point to go home and get myself ready for the wedding, but Cassie wanted me to stay and go right over with them to the church to get photos of her putting on her dress because again, her uncle wasn't comfortable with that. I called my BF and asked him to bring my dress, shoes, and makeup bag to the church and I would just get ready there. At the church, Karen throws a fit when I try to get ready in the bridal suite, demanding that it's for the bridal party only, ""Which you are NOT!"" and I end up having to change in a tiny bathroom stall because again, Cassie will not stand up for me. 

About 10 minutes before the wedding starts, Cassie comes to me and informs me that her uncle, who lives 2 hours away, as forgotten his camera and begs me to do ALL the photos for her wedding, since there is no time for him to go home and get it. I ask the logical question, ""What kind of professional photographer forgets his camera for a wedding he's shooting?"" Cassie ignores my question and continues to beg and plead. I tell her that I will, but for my originally offered price of $200. She tells me that she cannot afford that, since she and Graham never budgeted for a photographer. She nearly starts crying, so being the good friend that I am, I agree to do the photos for free. 

Here's the real kicker- after the ceremony, my BF finds the uncle and learns that NOT ONCE did Cassie EVER ask him to do the photos for her wedding. He even said that he would never do a wedding for free, not even for family, and would have charged her like $1000. I'm guessing, she knew this. It seems that her intent all along was to con me into doing them for free. When I later talked to Cassie's mom about this- who keep in mind I have known since I was 10- she tells me that not only was this true, but that it was all Karen's idea. Her mom had told her not to do that to me, as it was wrong and would upset me and ""you don't do that to your best friend,"" but clearly Cassie did not listen. I decided not to confront Cassie that day, since it was her wedding day, despite my BF trying to get me to go boot-stomp her during her first dance (it was tempting). After the last of the photos were taken, my BF and I left without a word. 

Not once throughout the day had I gotten so much as a thank you from the bride. Oh and Karen bitched and complained and tried to make things hell for me when were were doing group and couple photos after the ceremony- no shock there- and it was the groom who did finally tell her to shut the fuck up (I later learned that he hates her too and we bonded over it at the reception, lol).

Four days, FOUR days after the wedding, Cassie starts asking where the wedding photos are. I tell her that I haven't gotten to them yet because I have been picking up extra bartending shifts to make up for the revenue I lost the weekend of her wedding (weekends are always more profitable for bartending and I'd taken the days off, not loss of revenue because of the photos, though obviously that was also true). She just says, ""oh"" and nothing else. She did say thank you when I did finally give her the photos a couple of weeks later. I also finally confronted her about the situation. She apologized for going along with Karen's idea, but only apologized because her new husband coerced her to do so. Graham even tried to give me $100, but Cassie stopped him, saying that I ""agreed"" to do it for free. She then said that the photos were like my gift to them, but I had also gotten them an actual wedding gift- a set of new glassware from their registry that was like $200- which I regret not taking back on the day of the wedding when my BF told me to. 

We lost touch for a little over a year after this and oddly, it's not what broke our friendship beyond repair. But that's a story for another day ;) Let me know if you want to hear it.",11,1731689086.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,0.93,False
1gs0m5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gs0m5c/my_daughters_imaginary_friend_keeps_predicting/,My Daughter’s Imaginary Friend Keeps Predicting Tragedies.,"It started with a simple question. “Mommy, can imaginary friends be real?”

I glanced up from my laptop. My seven-year-old daughter, Lily, stood in the doorway of my home office, clutching her stuffed bunny. I smiled. “Of course not, sweetheart. That’s why they’re called imaginary.”

Her lips pursed. “But what if they know things?”

I frowned. “What kind of things?”

Lily shrugged, her gaze darting away. “Just stuff. Never mind.” She shuffled out before I could press further.

At the time, I didn’t think much of it. Kids have wild imaginations, right? But then… the accidents started happening.


---

The first time, it was a fire at our neighbor’s house.

The night before, Lily came to me looking pale. “Mommy, Olivia says Mrs. Carter’s house is going to burn down.”

I paused mid-sip of my coffee. “Who’s Olivia?”

“My friend,” Lily said simply, as if that explained everything.

“She’s your imaginary friend?” I asked, smiling.

Lily hesitated, then nodded. “She doesn’t like being called imaginary.”

“Right,” I said, humoring her. “Why does Olivia think Mrs. Carter’s house will burn down?”

“She just knows,” Lily said. “She knows lots of stuff.”

I reassured Lily it was just her imagination, but the next morning, sirens blared down our street. Flames consumed the Carter house, black smoke billowing into the sky. Luckily, Mrs. Carter was unharmed—she’d gone out for groceries minutes before the fire started.

When Lily heard, she didn’t seem surprised. “I told you,” she whispered.


Two weeks later, Lily mentioned Olivia again.

“Mommy, Olivia says to stay away from the bridge tomorrow.”

I froze. “Why?”

“She says it’s going to fall.”

My stomach knotted. The bridge was part of my daily commute. “Lily, that’s not funny.”

“I’m not joking,” she said earnestly. “Please don’t go.”

Against my better judgment, I worked from home the next day. Around noon, I got a news alert: Massive Bridge Collapse Leaves Five Dead, Dozens Injured.

I stared at my phone, a cold sweat breaking out across my skin. The bridge Lily warned me about had collapsed during the morning rush hour. If I’d ignored her, I might’ve been on it.

When I confronted her, she just shrugged. “Olivia told me.”

“Who is Olivia?” I demanded.

“She’s… my friend,” Lily said, her voice trembling. “She says bad things are going to keep happening.”


---

From then on, Olivia’s predictions became a regular occurrence. A car crash at an intersection. A storm that uprooted trees. A freak accident at the grocery store. Every time, Lily would relay Olivia’s warnings, and every time, I brushed them off—until they came true.

I tried everything to understand. Was Lily hearing things? Seeing something I couldn’t? I even took her to a therapist, who chalked it up to coincidence and a vivid imagination. But it didn’t feel like coincidence.

One night, I decided to push. “Lily, what does Olivia look like?”

“She’s pretty,” Lily said softly. “But her eyes are black, like the night.”

The hair on my arms stood up.

“Where does Olivia live?” I asked.

Lily pointed to her closet.

I laughed nervously. “In your closet?”

“She doesn’t live there,” Lily clarified. “But that’s where she comes from.”

That night, I locked Lily’s closet door.


---

A few days ago, Lily came to me crying. “Olivia says you’re in danger.”

I felt a chill. “From what?”

“She won’t say,” Lily sobbed. “But she’s scared.”

The last time Olivia predicted danger, it saved my life. So, I started taking precautions. I stayed home, avoided sharp objects, and double-checked every lock. Nothing happened.

Then, yesterday, Lily’s room went cold.

I was tucking her in when she whispered, “She’s here.”

“Who’s here?”

“Olivia,” Lily said, her voice shaking. “She says… it’s too late.”

The lights flickered. I spun toward the closet. The locked door creaked open, though I hadn’t touched it.

“Mommy…” Lily’s voice was barely audible.

Something stepped out of the shadows.

I don’t know how to describe it—long limbs, skin stretched too tight, and eyes like endless voids. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t anything I could explain.

“Leave her alone!” I screamed, throwing myself in front of Lily.

The thing tilted its head, as if studying me. Then, it smiled—an impossibly wide, jagged grin.

“You can’t stop what’s coming,” it whispered, its voice a rasp that chilled me to the bone.

And then, it was gone.


---

Now, Lily won’t speak. She just sits in her room, staring at the closet door. She won’t eat, won’t sleep, and flinches whenever I get too close.

The worst part? I’ve started hearing things—soft whispers at night, scratching from inside the walls.

Last night, I woke up to find Lily standing over me, her eyes unfocused.

“Olivia says it’s your turn,” she whispered.

I don’t know what’s happening, but I’m scared. Whatever Olivia is, she’s not imaginary. She’s real—and she’s not done with us.

Finally, before leave, i wrote fast 3 aff./gratt. And re-read ""manifest game"", before go. 
They were-
✅ 1.  I like to McDonald's employees.
✅ 2. I attract all good.
✅ 3. I am confident.

I started put things in jacket, when one of the McDonald's employee came to me and said:  ""Hello! As you are our regular customer, we would like to you offer another coffee for free! Do you wish?"", I:""Wow.. of course, thanks!"".
After minute he gave me the same coffee. Then i walked out of McD (to walk to home) and immediately knew, that universe heard  my /affirmation/gratitude/maniff. game ! 🥹🤩

------------------------
I was in shock! I couldn't believe, but in these 24h i didn't thought nothing negative- just - ""well, let it be or no"". My only thought was, do I need to say that in native,or original lang. as the manifest game is in English language. Anyway, i said it both lang. But affirmation wrote in native. And maybe that was from aff. not ""game"". 
Anyway now my empty coffee cup is standing in room 
to remember - anything is possible!👍

Also I need to mention- i manifested 2 times yesterday evening and in morning. Because some of this posts, ""miracle"" was immediately.

My state senator, Scott Wiener, is basically a Likudnik, and has been accusing his Jewish constituents of being antisemites. Scott likes to talk about the antisemitism he faced as a kid (in South Jersey) but his campaign funding comes from a PAC run by an open antisemite (Garry Tan.) (Scott is gay and is also willing to throw trans people under the bus to get the endorsement of one of our local bigots, Josephine Zhao.)

Scott is also coordinating his attacks with former AIPAC employee Tye Gregory (https://x.com/tyegregory), who heads up our local JCRC.

Scott funds a whole slate of local candidates, including Matt Dorsey (gay former comms guy for the police, ""former"" GHB and meth addict) and Trevor Chandler (gay former AIPAC lobbyist). These two gentiles are our own Ritchie Torreses, and come out as surrogates for Scott and Tye for the flimsiest of accusations, e.g.

And the guy whose coffee shop was spray-painted: [https://gayshame.net/index.php/boycott-mannys/](https://gayshame.net/index.php/boycott-mannys/)

All of the local press falls for Scott's act (though the SF Standard is the personal mouthpiece of billionaire Michael Moritz, and he seems to have a slightly better nose for true antisemitism.)

The net result of Scott's tireless work to smear progressives is the erosion of local support for the Democratic Party, leading to the most Republican votes since 1988.

Okay, so I know this sounds really strange, but I’ve been having some thoughts recently that I’m not sure how to process. I’m (M27) generally a pretty normal guy, and I don’t think of myself as someone with, like, weird quirks or anything. But for the past few months, I’ve been noticing a shift in how I view certain objects, and now I’m really starting to question if I’m overreacting or if there’s something deeper going on.

It started off small. I found myself becoming unusually attached to certain things—like, my favorite jacket, my old desk chair, even the specific mug I drink my coffee from every morning. At first, I thought it was just comfort, like a sentimental attachment to things that remind me of good times. But lately, the feelings have become a lot more intense.

I’m not just *fond* of these things anymore—I’m *drawn* to them in a way I can’t explain. I catch myself thinking about my desk chair when I’m away from it, wondering what it’s doing while I’m not around. When I sit in it, I get this feeling of warmth and security, and I start to feel like it’s almost… *alive*? I know that sounds insane, but it’s like the chair is just *right* for me. It molds to me in a way that’s just so perfect, it’s almost like we’re connected.

But it doesn’t stop there. The other night, I was sitting at my desk, and I found myself staring at the legs of the chair for what felt like forever. And then, I swear, I thought I heard it *whisper*. No, not in a creepy way, but more like a *soft, comforting presence*—like it was telling me it understood me. I brushed it off, thinking I was just exhausted, but the next day, I realized I was *genuinely* looking forward to sitting in it again. It’s hard to explain, but I just felt… a pull toward it.

And it gets weirder. The other day, I found myself kind of… *appreciating* my kitchen appliances in a way that seemed way too much for an average person. The way my toaster gleams in the light, or how my fridge hums so smoothly—it’s like these objects have their own little personalities, and I feel a strange sense of intimacy with them. I even thought I caught myself *blushing* while unloading the dishwasher the other day. I’m not even kidding.

Then, the other night, I had this dream. I was walking around my apartment, but everything was different. My furniture, my appliances—they were all… *alive*, and I was in this surreal romantic comedy where I was the lead, falling for my objects. At one point, my blender winked at me. And I *woke up* feeling kind of disappointed. I know, I know… I’m starting to sound like I’m losing it.

Now, I’m getting genuinely concerned. Am I overreacting here? I don’t want to say I’m “in love” with my stuff, but it’s becoming harder to ignore the way I’m feeling about these objects. It’s not just about liking them anymore—it’s more like a deep emotional connection, and it’s starting to feel a bit *too* personal.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Or am I just totally out of my mind at this point?",1,1731688593.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**Looking for platonic friendship and friends only.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

I got in at 7:00am. It’s calm, so I made myself some coffee and went to speak to the breakfast staff. I came back out a couple minutes later to see a tall man standing at the entrance, staring at me. *Ick #1… tf do you want bro?*

So I greeted him and asked him if I could help him with something. 

“Yeessss…”, he answered, as if I could read his mind. *Ick #2*

I went over to the desk where he explained to me that he was charged for a day he didn’t stay. He then handed me a folio someone had printed for him. I took a look at it, and it clearly showed a refund for the mistake. *This was half an ick, because I get that folios are confusing sometimes. But when I learned that he had just had this same conversation with my coworker who already explained to him that he was refunded, it became Ick #3–lack of comprehension.*

The whole while that we’re talking, he went on and on about how he stays here all the time, and everyone knows him, even going as far as naming all my coworkers. *Ick ick ick #4! I don’t care who knows you and how popular you think you are!* Then he got on me… *“You must be new, I’ve never seen you here before.”* 

“I’ve been here 7 months.”

*”…oh, you must have started when I stopped coming as much.”* 😒

I finally got the gift of his absence when he went over to talk to the restaurant server. *”SEE, I KNOW HIM TOO!”* 😣😣😣

Then he leaned over to the server and said *”That lady there wasn’t very nice to me.”* 

*He’s now graduated from icks to straight up annoying.*

When he finished talking, he walked past the desk and said *”I just had to get you to smile!”*

And I officially don’t like him now. I’ve said it before on this sub, and I’ll say it again: nothing will make me want to smile less than someone explicitly telling me to smile. Like bro, you can be a regular at some place and still be a decent human being. But his main character vibes were super off putting. Not a fan. ",26,1731688439.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,10,0.81,False

Turned out one of our housemates was a thief who was stealing money and food from others for years, while her friend covered her up. They pushed the blame on new neighbors after getting friendly with them. Me and my bf recognized the thief right away due to multuple red flags, so she and her bestie weren't able to pull the same trick with us. We eventually exposed the thief and kicked her out of the house, but the thief's friend was allowed to stay. This friend acts like a total douche to us, but no one but me feels that it's wrong to keep her around and treat her as if nothing happened. I feel morally gaslit and torn apart, as other neighbors 'moved on' with her and try to shame me for not doing the same.  
  
This whole story actually had lots of details, but I tried to cut it shorter.

So me and my bf moved to the big house to rent a room in May. At the time the house had 8 other neighbors and a really dark history, but of course nobody told us about it when we walked in. All we saw at first was a really big house, cheap rent, and friendly smiley neighbors. The first two faces I saw were (the names are fake) Addy’s and Ratty’s. Addy had a child and a lover living in her room without ever coming out (let’s call her hikku lover Stacey). And Ratty was her closest friend that believed everything Addy said and acted however Addy told her to. All I knew about these two from the beginning, that they were the oldest inhabitants of that house and basically considered it their own territory. I also knew that different tenants came and went but Raddy duo told me it was normal, i.e. ‘well they just moved out cos rent was so high/they got tired of living in one place’ etc. I found it pretty sus as neighbors indeed moved pretty quick, but those two were pretty good at babbling so I brushed it off. Aside from Addy, Ratty and Stacey, the house had five other neighbors but they weren’t that chatty with me and my bf when we just moved. As they told me later, they weren’t sure of whether we’d keep the hidden information about Addy in secret so we wouldn’t ruin their plan to finally get her out from the house, and that’s why they stayed silent. But the truth is, that I started seeing red flags in Addy a few days after me moved to our room already. Here’s what happened.

At first, I noticed how Addy started regularly knocking at our door and when opened, she literally squeezed herself inside and searched the whole room with her eyes rapidly while asking us about something. What did she ask about? ‘Ohh guys, we have to pay that one bill urgently but I forgot where my card was! Can you share some cash with me?’ While staying. In our. Room and glazing. Of course we always patiently declined her requests as we both found it quite weird. She also tried to borrow some money for whatever thing she had in mind, pretty often, but then one of our neighbors (let’s call her Elle) whispered to us that Addy never gives any borrowed money back. Me and my bf decided to look deeper into all of that weird issues and searched the whole chat we were invited to after moving to the house. And oh boy what did we find! Either Addy and Ratty were really that self-confident or just dumb, but they didn’t delete anything that was ever written to the chat. And the chat included: 1) several ‘older’ neighbors complaining of their money, food and coffee being stolen; 2) one of the victim was really friendly with Addy and invited her to his room where he accidentally showed her where his money was, but when he tried to bring it up in the chat during the discussion on who the thief might be, Ratty started cussing him out for ‘being rude’ to Addy and the poor guy was basically silenced; 3) nobody closed the doors at that time so money was gone from multiple people. Guess who wasn’t affected? Addy, Stacey and Ratty. This thievery caused victims to move, and after me and my bf contacted them, they admitted that they left due to thieves living in the house. And when we learnt this story, we noticed how our things started disappearing too (our toothpaste, detergent and soap). Elle and other neighbors also pointed out in the chat that the food got stolen from them. So the thieves are still here and aren’t even trying to hide?!

Now we’re in shock! We’re reaching out to Elle and our ‘silent’ neighbors and realize that they knew everything too. Long story short: they know that Addy is a thief who’s still unpunished, and Ratty is basically covering her up for several years straight. Apparently the victim neighbors were too traumatized to do anything about her or get the evidence of her thievery and they just preferred to leave. But Ellie and her bf wanted to actually catch Addy. It turned out that they managed to put a camera in the kitchen and catch Addy stealing food from them, but they wanted to also catch her stealing money to report her to the police. During that time Addy started to suspect that we know her dirty secret, so she and Ratty started acting really aggressive towards me, because I’m much worse at handling my emotions than my bf and my face basically said ‘You awful b\*tches!’ every time they were around me. She didn’t know about the camera but knew I'm suspecting her, so she created the 'genius’ plan. She wanted to shove all the stolen food on me and my bf as if we were the thieves and make us move out. So she and Ratty started spreading the rumours about me which were of course dismissed by the footage later lol. What’s important, is that Ratty was on her side ALL THE TIME and tried to pressure me for the things I didn’t do. It all caused me so much stress that I wanted to move the hell out, so Elle decided to make the footage public sooner.

So. The thief got exposed. It was hilarious and horrible at the same time. Stacey turned out not to know a single thing about it (as she said…) so they broke up immediately and Stacey moved out. Elle and the other neighbors also said to Addy that she has to leave within one month otherwise Elle would call a police on her. Addy left soon thank god. But what of Ratty, her little Bonnie in crime? When she learnt that her besitie indeed was a thief, she cried. Because her bestie got exposed!! She was soo sad about it. She also wanted to move out from the house because… she hated us who exposed her boo lol. And we cheered, no more rats in the house! …Oh well. She decided to stay. Because the rent in other houses was too high lol. And to tell you even more, she kept acting arrogant and haughty to us. As if we were the bad guys and she was the victim, not the other way around. I was shocked. I’ve never seen such disgusting and vile human being in my life. I wanted her gone too! This lady literally spread rumors about me in order to kick me out and cover her thief friend as she did for years! But y’know what Elle & the others said?

She said: ‘\[OP\], I’m so tired of this rat hunting. Can we just live in peace please? Ratty is paying her rent and she didn’t steal anything. Yuh she’s pretty nasty but you can just treat her as a neighbor or nothing else. Plus, you weren’t even stolen money, so what’s your issue?’ Guys, I couldn’t believe it. My whole morale was literally screaming ‘WHAT. THE HELL!’ Yeah, she wasn’t the DIRECT thief. But she supported the thief, even after exposure. She talked so much shit about me and my bf. She’s freaking disgusting, every time I look at her smug face I wanted to puke. While I was trying to explain it to Elle, she got irritated by me: ‘Why can’t you just bury the hatchet? This story is in the past, and the thief’s gone. Just accept it’.

Months have passed since then, and everyone now treats Ratty like a regular human being. She NEVER accepted her fault and she kept acting arrogant (she didn’t even clean her part of the house or wash her dishes, but no one cares about it or treats her any differently). But I never forgot anything, and I still feel so much rage when I see her mug. So you can act like a total douche but you still experience no consequences? Is this how ‘adult world’ really works? My morale doesn’t and will never accept such a scenario. Please tell me if I’m wrong? It really boggles my mind and it causes so much rage and anxiety within me.

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

A mutual friend approaches me and says one of her friends has seen a picture of me and asked for my number, I say sure, and a few days later I’m sent her number.

We text for about 2 weeks trying to meet up, but we’re both busy and don’t manage to meet for the first 2 weeks. We have a date and both get on well, have a fair bit in common, laugh, and both say we’ve had a good time.

However… her messages went from maybe 3-4 messages a day before the date, to 1 a day after the date… so from this I take that despite saying she has had fun on the date, she isn’t all that interested in seeing me again, so no worries I pull back. However… the mutual friend tells me a few days after the date that she said that has had a good time and wants to see me again. So we continue to message, but then for the next few weeks every time I ask her out again, she says she’s busy for one reason or another. Too busy for a full date, so I suggested just a 30 minute coffee for example (I know there’s more that goes into it, but I just tried suggesting something low pressure and low intensity). I actually asked her twice in the weeks following our date if she was actually interested as she can never meet, to which she replied with “I am, I’d let you know if I wasn’t”. 

Weeks have passed since the first date and we don’t talk anymore, the conversation naturally came to a stop. It’s sad but she can’t have been interested, as she never wanted to meet, right?

If she wasn’t interested I’d have forgotten about this after the first date, but 4 times she said she was interested, so what gives…

My question is I suppose, despite saying she was, she couldn’t have been interested? And if she was, why couldn’t she go out at all? It’s not like she was just too busy to go out full stop, we have each other on sc and she was going out with friends, meals etc… and if she wasn’t interested in me, why not just say?

The city was still bustling with activity but not as much as in the day. Drunits stumbled in the odd places & Watchman patrolled in groups of two. The local town watchman & core of Marrienburg‘s militia were simply known as the black caps. The name coming from the floppy black caps issued to the members on duty. One was often carrying a Lamp hanging on a polearm sized staff, the other carrying a crossbow, Sword & shield, or Metal studded club. Some were dealing with vagrants or disturbances there duty to protect the public & property of the city. Unlike many town militias they take pride in being fairly by the books & not known for taking bribes. Some spoke Tilean while others Reikspiel. The city had hired a company of mercenaries to bolster the numbers in these difficult times. Marrienburg had been invaded before, & it was the Black Caps who Drove off Bretonnias last invasion from the city before the Empire State armies arrived to restore the status quo.

‘The Streets were starting to get colder this time of year, not freezing yet. But one would be grateful of wearing good clothes & a hat this time of year or they kept moving. Our adventurers were told that instead of accommodations at the tavern, Herr Gideon thought it cost effective & simple to just have them quarter in the ship as Tobalts shipment was loaded & the crew made its way to the ship. Some sailors went to the temple of Mannan to give offerings before the journey, but Cornelius was informed that a courier would alert his companions of the location of the ship.

’As they passed the bridge they could see the open sea in the distance & the mighty fortress situated at the mouth of the harbor that guards the entrance to the River Reik & Marrienburg. Entire fleets have attacked & been broken on those defenses, but it was not unassailable to all. The High Elf Fleet reportedly the strongest navy in the world had once broken through & burned down segments of the city in retaliation for a single pirate attack on a merchant vessel.‘

(If you divide up as a party thats your choice.)

’As they entered the southern district the streets became more barren. Around the Orphanage of saint Rutha (Purple 6) A voice came from the darkness.’

”Cornelius Tempest, you’ve got some nerve.”

‘A woman’s voice from the shadows, She stepped out & the visage was one that nobody expects & few wish knowing, one that Cornelius unfortunately knew not by experience but by association & reputation.’

There trades obvious Stevedores, the men & woman who worked the sleepless docks of Marrienburg & other ports. Trading the goods was valuable, but without these strong limbed folk, nothing would be loaded or unloaded properly onto the ships which was more complicated then one might realize. It was hard work, dangerous too, heavy cargo & all they had was grit, muscle, hooks & a few pulley ropes, one slip up & you’re crushed or not paid if the cargo was destroyed. The Fish were a hard gang, tough one & all & their leading enforcer was one of the meanest & most insane. They all wore green like the strange woman, their clothes worn & used patched up in places. They all however wore thick leather coats that went down to their lower legs. The coats were Sleeveless however to show there big arms from many hours in there trade. Tattoos of varying fish some common others exotic marked there arms.

[The big men & woman of the Stevedore profession were a common site in cities like this.](https://preview.redd.it/8azcahs6931e1.jpg?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=880ad0bdfd13482b0730292849d8df5f58c910ef)

‘The Empire was known to possess numerous gangs like this, but by far the most infamous were the Hooks & the Fish. Both hated each other & clashes between the two were common. Cornelius knew this enforcer by reputation. Breen, despite her appearance, Breen was in fact a human, not a mutant though at glance one might understand the mistake. The woman was a strange fish with a verve for body modifications. She clipped her own nose. Plucked every follicle of hair from her head & trimmed her ears & scarred her lips getting tattooed scales on the top of her head & arms. Likely this was all done to better resemble a Fish, as if it wasn’t obvious enough.’

“Come on Tempest, don’t you remember your old pal Breen, or one of my bosses, Mister Pike. Cause you botched the last job. That cargo wasn’t what was promised & it wasn’t unguarded.”

’Smuggling & theft cargo theft along with other illicit activities were a common method of income for the Fish gang, Breen was wearing an old Short sword on her belt while the others had knuckle dusters, daggers & big hooks on there belt used in there trade.’

‘Breem was the Fishes Top enforcer in Altdorf. The gangs home turf, she wasnot happy about being reassigned even to a theoretically more lucrative city like Marrienburg, too much competition & lack of home field advantage. Her temper was bad & she was utterly brutal & insane as if it wasn’t obvious enough. She gave a grin, ugly that glinted in the lamplight of the streets, her teeth filed to sharp fangs every last one. She spoke with a Reikland accent & was oozing that she enjoyed this part of her job the most.’

“Arabayan Coffee, & Gunpowder. I get there both dark colored & Come in funny lil containers. But we were promised military grade gunpowder, & we got coffee. We lost three lads to the watch & six arrested. So either you lied, or you’re stupid…I think it’s both, cause you’re stupid for lying to the Fish.”

’Some of the gang members moved a little closer but made sure she was in the lead.’

“You know how this has gotta go right? We’ve played nice before, but they send me…that means playing nice is over. 40 shillings you can cough up now & maybe I’ll just take a thumb or something else, maybe just one hand so you can sail the easy rivers if your apologize & fork over a little extra to mister Pike. Or I take the 35 you owe us & throw your corpse in the Reik to feed the eels. What’ll it be?”

’While Cornelius hadn’t met her, he had met mister Pike. The deal in question being mark 4 military grade gunpowder barrels he delivered for the fish to collect & replace with whatever they wanted I suppose.’

”She looked & only saw a few of Cornelius’s new traveling companions & seems surprised.’

”Never knew you to travel with a Circus Tempest.”

(This is a combat scenario that can shift however you wish, If not all the players travelled together then I can make a secondary comment describing the ship.)",3,1731687271.0,WFRP_Divers_Adventure,1,1.0,False
